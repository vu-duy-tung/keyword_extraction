They also are good about not keeping you waiting if you are on your own. \u00a0nice.2. \u00a0If you are jetlagged and eating at odd hours they have super cheap deals. Get on that. \u00a03. \u00a0You can do your laundry next door while you eat. \u00a0Look how efficient you are.4. \u00a0Thalis mean you don't really have to make up your mind, Just order big and eat all kinds of goodness.5. \u00a0The desserts look delicious but I'm always so full I've never been able to try them.6. \u00a0Way cheaper and way better service than Chor Bizarre. \u00a0Whack ass Chor Bizzare, get that shit out of my face. \u00a0Whatever, lists are weaksauce, I'm sorry for even doing that. \u00a0I eat here all the time. \u00a0ALONE. \u00a0Come on, if that isn't going to persuade you to eat here then stop reading yelp, you are beyond helping.",

We enjoyed the butter chicken and the lamb vindaloo, each served as larger dishes accompanied by a mango chutney, mango sauce, lentils, rice and potatoes. Honestly one of these large dishes with a side of garlic naan is more than enough for two. But it was so tasty and we got greedy so the second serving was necessary. I definitely recommend this place and would come back again!",

Service was excellent. \u00a0The waitress explained the menu to us and took our drink orders immediately. The decor is modern and cozy. Soft lighting throughout the restaurant but still very upbeat with a combination of large party groups and tables for two.We each ordered the Grand Thali, thanks to our gluttonous behaviour!The Grand Thali consists of a canap\u00e9, papadum and chutney, a choice of curry, two vegetables, dal (lentil), raita (yoghurt), salad, chapati (indian bread) & rice. It sounds like a lot of food, but each of the dishes come out in mini bowls so you get to try a bit of everything. Price was 10-12GBP each. Also on the menu is a good selection of starters; cold and hot, as well as 'street food' appetizers. We wanted to try some; however, resisted since our eyes are always bigger than our stomach.Very satisfied with this meal, as it was the end of our Europe trip.",

I had trouble finish it up but forced my self anyway.Something to keep in mind, for next time, I should skip lunch if I am heading out here for dinner. My husband had the butter chicken with naan and a chicken biryani. The portions were huge and he was able to finish it up quite easily. Service is very good. I was quite surprised how attentive the waiters were.Always had our glasses of water topped up. One of the few good Indian restaurants in the Covent Garden area. Good find, definitely going back.",

    "text": "I come here a lot. I mean, a LOT.Mainly because of a promotion (no longer participating :() that gets me half price food to be honest. This makes their thalis a great lunch treat if I'm feeling like a chilled lunch. The grand thali is a fantastic beast comprised of a curry of your choice alongside several vegetable side dishes; always different, always a delight. Round it off with some rice, chutneys and a chapatti and you have yourself a meal. I'm that weird kind of person who doesn't mind taking a gamble on menus so this sort of pot-luck approach to the thali is awesome and encourages repeat visits. Quality of the food is good. The meat is cooked decently, never dry, and the curries have a great combination of flavours. The fact that the majority of your meal is in fact vegetarian and still fantastically tasty is testament to the chefs here (yeah, I'll say it, a lot of vegetarian food is bland and pointless)At full price the dish is decent value; at half price I'm planning my return trip on the way out of the door.Oh, one word of warning. Don't order the masala cola. Grim.Update on the taste london card discount: they no longer do it. However their lunch deals are still reasonable (starter and a regular thali for a tenner) so it's still not terrible value for money.",

Unless you have a really large appetite, just get the regular thali. The thali came with a potato salad type dish (which was excellent), green mint/coriander dish, and I can't recall. Either way, I enjoyed it and would definitely go back again. Apparently, the owner is supposed to be similar to Tayyabs, which is another good Indian joint. (Don't take me for my word...this is what I heard from another person who lives here.) I have been to Tayyabs, and the wait is RIDICULOUS. Masala Zone is quite nice. Not loud. Nice ambiance.

They're decently priced, always a plus when the food tastes decent too.When in London, I usually end up eating here at some point during my stay. Again, not into Indian food, but this place makes the cut. Its not good when you have it delivered, so be sure to visit a location. If I were you, I would order:the grand thali with veges or prawns (the prawns are not good in Indian food from what I've been having...they're just way too small & unfulfilling)This grand thali comes served on a huge round silver tray with little silver bowls of a crazy variety of spices, herbs, sauces, salads, veges, indian bread, rice, and lentils.I've never had Indian food served like this until this place, so it was unique. The whole layout of this particular place is pretty nice, simple, oak/wood decor, bar like seating in some areas, not usually crowded.I don't know if there is a specific way, or a specific order to eat everything on these trays, but I just graze about, trying all the different colored & textured randomness. Works for me every time. I don't like the yoghurt they serve with the entrees, nor do I like their special herb sodas, SOO GROSSS. Don't do it, don't. This place is better than any other Indian place I've tried. I really don't like buffet styled restaurants, and most of the Indian places I've been to are, so good on ya Masala Zone for taking the road less traveled.",

Most importantly, \u00a0its different from the standard curry house - in a good way!They have plenty of room but you should expect to wait a little while on busy nights as they're very popular. Food wise the thali is my favourite, you get a range of starter dishes and your own choice of main course but they also do a great line in tandoori. As if that wasn't enough the cocktails are delicious! There are a couple of negatives... I'd say that its a little impersonal and sometimes rushed. The menu is also not very extensive, you'll quickly find yourself returning to the same old thing.On the whole its well worth a visit, there are some great dishes and a great night to be had!",

It was spacious, not noisy, clean, bright and nice design painted on the walls.I enjoyed my thali, although the selection is slimmer than a typical Indian restaurant. The spice level was at the top of my range, so I do not recommend if you like bland food. My only disappointment was that I had to get up to get the bill 15 minutes after the waitress confirmed I was done and did not want any dessert or tea.",

    "text": "I dined with two friends (26 October 2011) at Masala Zone in Soho. We had early dinner reservations (6pm), as we flew in that morning from the USA and Canada. The place is quite lively and filled up quickly. The acoustics was pretty bad, but we still had a very nice time together.  My friend Lee selected Masala Zone for its Thali, which we all ordered. Thali is a medley of different dishes served on large platters. I selected the butter chicken for my meat course (you can choose chicken, lamb, shrimp, etc), which came with curry vegetables, lentils, raita, chapatis (whole wheat bread), and rice, all for about \u00a311.50. Everything was scrumptious and the chicken tender! While this is a chain restaurant, I thought the food was well prepared (the flavors of each dish blended well), and reasonably priced, especially in expensive London. I would definitely return here the next time I'm in London. I'll have to search out for a similar type of place where I live.",

The menu has a lot to offer and we ordered a butter chicken and thali with a coconut chicken base. Both were tasty. Other people at our table also got different thali meats, beef and veggies. Reason for 3 star was due to service. After we just sat down our waiter asked if we want an appetizer and we said no but ordered drinks. After 10 mins we got our beers and then ordered. \u00a0We ended up ordering an appetizer and the waiter made a smart remark \"oh now you want an appetizer\" we didn't say anything. After everyone dishes started to come out we got our butter chicken but no thali. We waited till everyone else at the table got their food and after a good 5mins I had to ask for it. The waiter grabbed his pad and doubled check everyone's order and said oh I'll get it now so it looks like the kitchen either missed our order or a runner brought our food to someone else. By the time we got the thali everyone else was done eating so we rushed to finished ours. We also asked for water 3 times and didn't get it till the end of the night. I think the over all experience could of been better because there are waiters, food runners, managers and busboys but we some how couldn't get water when we ask 3 different people for it.",

My girlfriend loves the thali, but I have one big problem with the place: they don't like people with nut allergies. Mention that you have a nut allergy in here and they present you with a bright yellow card informing you that if you eat one of their dishes and they happen to have chucked a brazil nut in it, then it's your own fault if you end up dead. Ask for the nut-free menu and you get a list that's barely one-eighth of the full menu. Is it too much to ask to eat something other than lamb rogan josh?

Fine. Bad service doesn't particularly bother me - if the food is good, I couldn't care less.My friends and I ordered vegetarian thalis. On reading the terrible reviews before my visit I had braced myself for the worst, but it was worse than I could imagine. The starters were okay albeit overpriced but as they were cold starters it was bearable.The thali was the worst indian food I was ever tasted.The poppadums within 1 minute had become soggy and there was no liquid on my plate but they tasted stale and were not crisp in the slightest, instead they had the texture of wet cardboard. The curries were COLD and I don't mean tepid, I mean COLD! They were completely lacking spice which is fine, I don't particularly want to eat food which has me running around screaming for water, but there was absolutely no flavour. So I had been presented with poor service, stale poppadoms, old cold tastless curries and at a price which is certainly not unbeatable!!Don't make the mistake I did in just taking a chance, because I can assure you it will not pay off!",

However, taking his advice on this chain while being in the neighborhood was a pleasant suprise.Masala Zone are a chain of retaurants with various themes, this one having the theme of an Indian marriage with close to 100 vibrant puppets from Rajasthan suspended from the ceilings. Definitely a great conversation starter.Menu is vast, but I went straight for one of the Thalis combo. I love my favorite Indian place in Glendale that does a great job on Northern Indian Thalis, so I had to see if this one stood up to it. I went with the The Grand Thali, which is equal to a starter and main course combined. It comprises a Canap\u00e9, \u00a0a choice of \u00a0curry, 2 vegetables (one green and one root), Dal (lentil), Raita (yoghurt), Indian salad, Papadum & Chutney, freshly-made whole wheat Chapatti (Indian bread) & Rice. You get to choose the meat. Be forewarned that when you say mild, it's VERY mild. You won't drip one bit of sweat at all. If you're like me and like to actually taste some spice in your food, medium should be good. Anywho, as noted on their website, the etiquette of eating a Thali is to spoon a small portion of food from an individual dish into the area next to the rice, and then combine it with the rice. Repeat this process in sequence. This enables the flavour of each dish to be appreciated individually. Do not either mix more than one dish simultaneously with the rice, or mix the rice in the individual bowls. Chapattis are eaten with the food by using a piece of chapatti to scoop the food from one of the dishes.For a chain restaurant, the Thali was great and a good portion. It's not \"home made\" Indian food, but it's food that's tasty and you can try different combos. After walking an entire day around London, this did the job for a casual sit down. Definitely make a reservation if you're going to eat at 6pm and after or be prepared to wait and wait at this location.",

    "text": "I have visited the Bayswater location twice and had a fabulous experience. The food was excellent, including the kabobs, butter chicken, rogan josh, thali, pav bhaji, chaat, etc. however, I had a terrible experience at this location. Yesterday, I came to this location for dinner. After a wait, we were seated and I ordered a lassi and then lamb seekh kabob and garlic naan. After 20 min, the kabob came out but the naan did NOT. After failing to get a waiters attention, I finally flagged one down and told her about the naan. She noted it and then continued working. 15 min later, still no naan. I finally flagged another server and she said she'd get us a naan. 10 min later, the naan showed up. It was flat, doughy, undercooked, and there was NO garlic. If you order garlic naan and you are being charged EXTRA for it being a garlic naan, there better actually be some garlic! And this wasn't a naan! This was a doughy chapati! And I know Masala Zone can do better since I had a good naan at the Bayswater location. I finally got the attention of the original server and asked him to send it back. He apologized briefly and offered to get me another one and check with the kitchen. 10 min later he finally came back and just said \"apologies for the naan\" and then went off again. We wanted the bill but the servers did not come by for another 10 min. Finally he came over and explained that he hadn't charged us for the naan and he had taken off the service charge. I was very disappointed by the customer service at this location and I probably won't be coming back. It's a shame.",

    "text": "Three stars indicates just ok, but let's be clear, I actually like the food here just fine. It's not your momma's cooking, no, but it's fresh, clean-tasting, and everything actually tastes different (you know the ol' takeaway curry joint trick of making a giant vat of bland base gravy and then just adding a dash of tomato paste, saag, spices, etc to make it into separate dishes, yeah? yeah, this place doesn't do that, as far as I can tell).I would say that the stand-out dishes are almost exclusively the veg ones. Chicken tends to be a little dry and tired; lamb tends to be only ok. The veggie offerings are really quite nice, with a good range of starches and pulses and some solid paneer-based offerings.Thalis are a good size.So why the three stars? Primarily it comes down to price. Yeah, you can come in, get just a veg thali (\u00a311.15) and their cheapest drink (tea or filter coffee, I believe, at \u00a31.80) and have lunch for \u00a314.57 when you add in gratuity. But that's an expensive lunch for Soho when you can get a solid, fresh falafel wrap etc for under \u00a37 with a drink around the corner. And let's be real, you don't want just the thali: you want to try the appetisers (all sadly overpriced and not good value for the size, also generally underwhelming in terms of taste) and have a drink (also expensive), and maybe tack on a second curry to pad out your thali (\u00a33.50). The last time we went (yesterday, actually), we dropped just under \u00a360--ouch!--for lunch: lassi, iced tea, thali with extra curry, a curry main, two appetisers, two desserts (both of which were awful), a tea, and a coffee.What gets my (roast) goat here is that the pricing always feels vaguely like a scam about to happen. It's always a little different; this time it was \"If you order a main and a drink, it's 20% off!\" Hey, that sounds really good-- no, wait. \"The 20% off is already reflected in the menu. If you want the full-price menu, we can offer it.\" What even is this? Seriously, guys. It's not classy, and your poor servers have to keep explaining it like it's reasonable. Don't do it. Just admit your food is grossly overpriced and then offer a discount from the price you want to charge, if that's what you're after.Food also does take forever to come out. Granted, yeah, things are being made mostly to order, but let's be real, the kitchen doesn't hustle, and there's no excuse for dessert (pre-made sweets and a lump of ice cream) taking 15 minutes to appear. Basically, you can't just nip in for a quick lunch here. Set aside two and a half hours.I don't hate this place, though I do sort of hate how it's structured. But after this last wallet-searing experience, I'm done. I really am. So, how about it, fellow Yelpers: is there a decent Indian place anywhere near-ish to Soho?",

I head things like \"it's really good\" and \"there are clearly Indians making the food *and* eating there...\". I guess I should have asked for more elaborate descriptions.For a chain (famous last words), it's good. Better than just okay. You walk into the restaurant and it's undeniably aromatic, fresh spice and charred goodness emanating from the tandoor. Your palate whet with anticipation.My date and I dined on the Dari Puri and Goan Crispy Prawns to start. I didn't detect any chickpea in the Dari Puri, nor any chutney (perhaps it was the drizzle), but there was sure a mouthful of yogurt. The Goan Crispy Prawns were more crispy than prawn, and tremendously greasy. For our mains we had the Paneer Makhanwalla and Roghan Josh. Both mediocre, lacking the signature depth that we've all come to know and love from Indian cuisine, and falling a bit flat. The portion size was also slightly less than satiating. \u00a0Moral of the story: in a pinch, lack of similar alternatives, and need to get away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford and Regent, duck in here... it won't be offensive.",

I tried the Chai Negroni which I didn't like but in the restaurant's defense, it was labeled bitter and spicy. I tried something new; they aren't all winners. The Narial Punch was the perfect amount of sweetness and creamy texture. As for the meals, the food overall was incredibly full of flavor with different levels of heat. I highly recommend the cheese naan bread. I ordered two for myself, it was that good. Now to the bad stuff. As an American, I am comfortable in cargo shorts and a hoodie. Just because I look casual doesn't mean I'm broke or a poor tipper. I had to ask several times for more water AND when someone finally brought it, it was as if I was inconveniencing him for even being there. The food was divine, I can't deny that. My thing is I felt judged for how I prefer to dress. I still paid in full and as the tip was included in the bill, I can say my experience didn't warrant the 12.5% already added. Normally I tip 20% for excellent service. 0% would have been more appropriate. \u00a0As I am zaftig, I have no issue spending money on food.

    "text": "I usually go for grubbier Indian joints where I don't even quite care what cut of meat or animal is being slapped into the curry sauce, so Masala Zone was very \"Oh, I see, we are properly in the West. Carry on.\"Not that it's a super fancy place, but it's clean, shiny, and you certainly don't smell that pungent oily fog of curry that permeates your clothes for days after. Many of us opted for the thalis, which is the usual order for indecisive people like myself. Why have one dish when you can opt for like nine things on a big silver platter. You have a choice of GRAND and regular, so being American, I of course supersized mine, so the thali gained kachumber (tomato & onion salad), raita, and an appetizer. Both types of thalis have a choice of meat curry, two veg curries (root & leaf), chapati, rice, and papadum.The fish curry was fine as my main, though it could have used a kick in the spice levels. The chutneys and side sauces were on the blander side as well, but still mighty tasty. This might be an issue of getting used to more subtle flavors versus the sodium assaults of the curry houses I usually frequent.Great place for large groups of hunger diners since we were a group of eleven and were seated immediately, right around dinner time on a weekend.",

    "text": "Wow. Wonderful Indian food. I'm not the biggest fan of Indian good, but I was really impressed with every dish (may except for the stewed lentils). I came with a group of 5 friends around 8 on a Thursday. Since Masala is large and spacious, we were quickly seated.Based on Yelp photos, I decided to opt for a curry. I forget what it's called, but it was spicy (two chilies on the menu) but with nice coconut-y undertones and with large pieces of dark meat chicken. The curry doesn't come with rice, so I ordered some Yellow lemony-Jasmine rice which was perfectly seasoned, spiced, and I even found a roasted lemon rind mixed inside.I tried my friend's Butter Chicken curry, which was a different type of spicy. Not in the sense of hot-spicy, but more like a flavorful, almost sweet spicy. She ordered garlic naan on the side, which came out slightly fluffy, fresh and warm. Other friends ordered the Thalis, which are definitely meant to be shared. I sampled their small side dishes - the lentil stew was mediocre but everything else was great. Also, good service!Tl;dr - authentic, affordable Indian food in Soho.",

And overall, not really friendly at all.I wish now I had gone with the traditional Thali, but the dish I ordered sounded very good on paper. Noodles with prawns and squid.The dish came out very quick, considering their menu mentions giving them time to prepare everything fresh. Now the sauce was delicious. Very very good. But given the price of the dish being over \u00a317, there was very few prawns and only a couple pieces of squid.When I finished eating, it took a long time for anyone to check on me and get my bill (I had to ask for it). Even though I saw them attending to other tables.Therefore, given the poor service and price, I give it 2 stars.",

It was more like tomato soup. \u00a0Finally the rice didn't get eaten and the naan was bland.

The place does seem a bit overdecorated but the vibe and the atmosphere is pretty good - I can definitely see this place being a good date dinner venue. \u00a0Service was pretty lacking. Their payments system was down, and staff didn't seem to do a very good job communicating with each other so there was quite a bit of confusion and a pretty significant and frustrating delay. I ended up needing to pay in cash since they couldn't really sort out what was wrong. The food is delicious and very heavily spiced - the spicy offerings are actually quite spicy. They have thali sets that come with a little bit of everything if you like variety. The grand thali can be split between two people easily. Portions are reasonable although Masala Zone is a bit on the pricey side, although I don't think it's egregious for the area.",

The decor is great and if it was quiet it could even be romantic. That isn't possible however since this is close to soho's many bars.

It quickly filled, however, so I'd recommend a reservation (but it obviously worked out for us, so don't be deterred). They have a collection of curries that they serve on a platter with set sides, delicious chutney, and a few other things (called a thali). You can get a regular thali or a grand thali, which has a few more bells and whistles. You can add on another curry for a bit extra. We got the butter chicken (suuuuuper creamy) and the lamb curry (lamb was super tender). If you are moderately hungry, adding a curry to the grand thali would sufficiently feed 2. We didn't realize that and added the chicken kottu parantha. Kind of glad we did, though, because it was delicious. Spiced chicken with lots of veggies and delicious things. They warned us it would take longer to cook, but I thought it was served quickly.",

    "text": "This place has become like my second kitchen. I eat from here nearly everyday! You think I'm joking but I'm not. It helps that I live right next door but that isn't the only reason why I keep coming back. I love fresh food with flavor at bargain prices and that is exactly what I get here! How do I know it's fresh? Well, I see the delivery truck loaded with fresh fruit and veg everyday! Furthermore, I can smell the delish aromas of real Indian cooking creeping through the crevices of my windows and doors everyday! Typically my partner and I will order the regular sized thalis. The thali is basically like a set meal which comes with \u00a0sides of veg, potato, and lentils of the day, along with two sauces to eat with your popadoms, and then of course the main which is normally rice with whatever curry you choose. I usually go for the Prawn Malai. To me this curry is a perfect blend of creamy coconut milk based sauce with a barely there spice. My partner likes to get the Lamb Korma. I am a pescatarian so I cant personally comment on this curry, but I take it from the numerous people that have tried this dish that it is pretty damn good. \u00a0There isn't really any difference between the regular and large thali as you aren't getting larger portions with the latter. In fact, the extra bit is some naan bread, little salad, and small samosa. Regular thalis are about \u00a36-7. I definitely recommend this set as you'll get to taste a little of everything without spending more. \u00a0Dining in is also a nice option since staff are very congenial! The place itself is not posh but more casual. The look they're going for is maybe an underground clay like hut but creative and Indian inspired nonetheless. Compare this place to all the little restaurants on Brick Lane and Masala Zone would still come out on top for me. Only reason why this place didn't receive 5 stars is out of homage to my Indian friend's mum's cooking, who by far is the best at Indian cooking ever!",

It's like a crunchy mix of raw ingredients with a tamarind tang. Yum. The main courses were good too and the wine went well with the moderately spiced food.

A balanced selection of vegetarian to meat dishes available in combinations that illustrate the range of flavours from across India. As my record shows, I am a stern critic of sub-standard Indian/South Asian food. I can't bear insults to that culinary heritage such as bright red/orange sauces with generic chemical flavours which are an insult to the palate and do not represent 'Indian' food. If you want a curry out of a jar then get some muck from Sainsbury's or wherever but don't insult India's millenia of food tradition by calling it 'Indian' food. Masala Zone compliments India by serving proper Indian food - long may it stay that way! Prices are reasonable with excellent deals for 2/3 course lunches for between \u00a38.50/\u00a313. Dinners attract similar deals so you can be sure to fill up for \u00a315.",

Voted best value Indian in Soho by Timeout magazine, it's a fantastic Indian restaurant that has a great location, feels like a proper restaurant (to people like me who're usually on a budget anyway!) and doesn't break the bank. Masala Zone is built in a split level kind of way and has a lot of room - but it is so popular, you may have to wait a few minutes before you get a table, especially if you visit on Friday or Saturday night. I don't think it is possible to book ahead. The decor is nice and uncluttered with none of the kitsch that afflicts most Indian restaurants. The kitchen is located behind a glass panel and you can watch the chefs put your food together from the dining room. The service is polite and friendly and very quick. The food is essentially North Indian with a lot of curry and rice combinations. The chilli factor is clearly indicated and quite accurate. Try the double chilli options only if you really like spicy food! They also have a nice Indian drinks section, with the yoghurt based lassi being the thickest, creamiest lassi I've had in this country. Nimbu pani is the Indian lemonade and they also do a mean masala chai among other things. They have a liquor licence so you can also order from a selection of wines, beers, and a limited selection of cocktails. Everything I've eaten here has been good but among the starters a special mention goes to the seekh kabab which just melts in your mouth. The curries are all good; I haven't tried the noodle pots but if they really are the Indian version of Chinese (which is NOTHING like real Chinese!), then they should be worth a try. Their thalis seem to be very popular and are great value for money. Thalis are basically a full Indian meal served on a large metal plate (aka a thali). There are options in terms of the number of items you want and you can choose at least one of the items but in general a thali contains 2-3 vegetable curries, an optional non vegetarian curry, a poppadum, some rice, a lentil dish, and some sweet chutney. They also do a special ayurvedic thali for diabetics though I haven't tried this. In terms of prices, considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's located in Soho, it's very good value. My husband and I have stuffed ourselves for \u00a355 for two people but we've also gone as a group of 4, and the bill has come to \u00a368. It's possible to have a good meal and a drink there for under \u00a315. So all in all, Masala Zone is great place to eat if you're in Central London.",

    "text": "Not only am I the worlds number one curry fan, but im the worlds number one curry critic, and given the slightest reason ill happily put to shame a curry if its not up to my standards. Once I even dared to complaine about a korma I had ordered in Goa, as I found it sour tasting. The chef was not impressed and I got the feeling I wouldn't be welcomed back The Masala Zone in Soho leaves me without complaint, and no matter how hard I try to find fault, I'm always left hushed. Every dish on the menu is mouth watering, the starters are gorgeous and the mains are divine. If your lucky enough to have any room in your tummy left then indulge in an Indian desert of coconut ice cream, probably the nicest thing to come out of Asia since silk. A meal for two with drinks shouldn't set you back more then 30 pound.",

Masala Zone was the only one welcoming us, and hungry and thirsty we were just glad to get into a any place.The impression I got from the restaurant is that they offer fast food with Indian influence. My dish was actually very extraordinary mix of potato and banana (yes!) in a curry sauce and not bad at all. Creative at least! My friends experiences varied, but overall the food was ok. It was the service that gave us the empty feeling. The waitresses were really fast, and little too effective, and gave us this in-and-out fast food restaurant feeling. You know as soon as you lie your fork and knife on the empty plate, it vanishes! We felt like we were pushed out as by that time there was already queue to this restaurant as well but that just left us a bit disappointed by the experience.",

Menu is easy to read and the staff are very helpful explaining what everything is. I love food and I love curry, so I instantly went for a grand thali which is basically enough to count or a starter and main course. There wasn't a long wait till our huge platters arrived. I was a bit anti-social as I was concentrating so hard as I didn't know where to start with all the little bowls of delicious things. I accompanied my food with a yummy mango lassi which in hindsight I should have ordered for desert.We had a voucher for 2-4-1 mains but there were 4 of us the and waiter kindly re-printed another voucher for us making the evening even more sweeter! However everything is very reasonable anyway considering the quality and quantity of food.A big must for a quick fix curry or for a group occasion.",

    "text": "I have seen a number of reviews deriding this as merely a 'chain' as if that immediately detracts from its capability to deliver tasty robust and reasonably genuine Indian food. However when that chain has the parentage of the much respected Veeraswamy and Chutney Mary restauarants you tend to ignore that. Indeed as a 'chain' it has grown considerably but the quality of the food has not changed since there were one or two of them.Thankfully I have at least a good enough comparison of food having been to India and living in an area where there is a large Indian community and award winning restaurants. So I can say that this is very well done and very well presented food. The spicing is as it should be and pungently aromatic at times. Well priced for the West End and with friendly and efficient service, this is a favourite of mine.It can easily cater for couples or groups as they have tables of varying sizes. The menu caters for what they call 'street food' and is presented really as a fast food Indian experience. But that would be doing it down as these dishes are well worth savouring. It's not a restaurant to bring a romantic date nor is it one where the wine list will leave you breathless but for excellent and extremely tasty Indian food, well presented and efficiently served, you can't go wrong.",

I almost always go for the chicken tikka kabob, which changes flavors on a daily basis so we can be surprised when it arrives. \u00a0And the garlic baby spinach dish from the side order menu is a must have which we always share no matter what else we order.Don't let the fact it's a casual dining chain keep you away - Masala Zone is under the same ownership as the fantastic and upscale Veeraswamy on Regent Street (which you must treat yourself to at least once in this lifetime).",

We tried the sampler plate & they were all good. The chaat may not be as grand as that which you get in Delhi or Mumbai but it comes darn close.For mains we ordered the regular 'thali' and there wasn't one thing in there that we could complain about. The thali was fairly spicy, though (both my husband & I had to blow our noses once through the meal). The portions are large, so we were stuffed & didn't try the desserts. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The service was friendly & quick (we went after peak time & the restaurant wasn't full). We had 2 different restaurant staff walk over & ask if everything was OK.The bathroom area door is deeply recessed & you don't get to see the insides of it each time someone opens it (yay!)The \"show\" kitchen is visible from the dining area but it's pleasant to watch the activity in there. There main kitchen is behind recessed double doors & not visible. I liked the understated decor here (Warli murals on the walls) no Maharajas in gilded frames. The place is well lit.It is handicap accessible (call ahead for assistance).",

The Thali plates come with a bunch of little bowls filled with dal, various vegetables, yogurt, and other things that are great for dipping. You also get to choose a curry. I can personally vouch for the butter chicken, chicken mangalore, and the other spicy green chicken curry.The prices are already pretty reasonable, but if you want to have a very reasonably priced meal and there are two of you, try splitting a Grand Thali and throwing in an extra nan. You can also throw in an extra side bowl of curry. Even with the lassis the two of you can probably escape for just around 20 GBP. I think the only area that Masala Zone could significantly improve on is their nan. It lacks the freshness and fluffyness of excellent nan.Cheers",

    "text": "Lets say you were dating someone that was British-born Indian and you had never really had curry before and you asked them to bring you somewhere legit for your first curry experience. \u00a0Would you expect to be brought to a chain restaurant? \u00a0Let's just say I was mildly furious at the lack of effort. Let's also acknowledge that the term 'mildly' is an understatement. So I have to say the only curry I had before this was on a flight on Air India on which I was weighing the probability of statistical outcome on which would kill me first: \u00a0the shotty plane, the pilot that seemed to like to create turbulance where it probably didn't exist, or the botched airline food that came in containers, none of which I could identify other than the one that said \"water\"... So this being my first \"curry\" and living in the land of \"curry or go home\" I expected to prepare and deliver some speech on how \"oh gosh, this is what I've been missing, I feel so cultured\" \u00a0but instead I recited, \"hmm ok... well, thanks for ordering for me.\"Maybe Indian food isn't for me, it was ok, I've since walked by what seems like zillions of Masala Zones and have yet to be tempted to go back in. \u00a0As my date pointed out, there were other Indian people eating there and that was a good indication, so apparently it's somewhere close to legit. \u00a0I've been taken to two other places since then, one was supposed to be the top top top amazing and one was apparently supposed to be \"pretty good' for Brick lane standards, and they all tasted and looked the same to me but had different price tags. \u00a0I say this with the caveat that I'm apparently not a curry-person, but if someone is making me go get one with them, I'd rather just go to Brick lane.",

There is also a nice section of starters, which can be ordered separately.For me, the food is competent and the portions are generous but the flavour is average.

If you're ever unfortunate to walk into one of these places, might I suggest negotiating 10% off the menu price first. They usually oblige and you might feel a bit better knowing you salvaged something to go with that slab of ghee swimming in your belly.Masala Zone have thrived in part due to any lack of alternative choices but also through innovation (or modernisation), if I can call it that: Big, illustrated and descriptive menus; a bright interior; spacious seating; and well trained waiting staff that don't wear waistcoats. Most importantly of course is the food which I found to be a commendable effort. Previous visits with friends have taken in their renowned Thalis - a complete meal on a tray made up of several small dishes - and they've kinda dissapointed. The meat curry dishes aren't swimming in oil but at the detriment of any real flavours. Same with the vegetable dishes which were slightly on the cold side. At \u00a311 for a thali, I'd also question the value - sure the variety seems impressive but an espresso cupful of rice, some shredded onions with green bits and a pot of minty yoghurt does not fool the tummy.This recent visit with my buddy Nige saw us share: he, his lamb madras and I, my chicken mangalore. Supplemented with rice, chapatis and garlic spinach. For little more than a couple of thalis I'd say that it was a more fulfilling eating experience.The madras was delicious - heavy on the chilli and tempered by tamarind. Lamb seemed a tad overcooked but it could've been a bit too lean. The Mangalore chicken was just right in it's combination of spice and coconut, with ginger being most prominent. The chicken was a bit dry though and I'm finding this to be a common occurence in all their meat dishes.We decided on the Rasmalai for a sweet thing but other choices are standards - Golub Jamun, falouda (a sweet drink with colourful noodles) and kulfi almond ice cream. Rasmalai was a great choice - light, spongey, milky patties soaked in a saffron flavoured milk sauce and topped with pistachios went down a treat with the chai teas.Masala Zone is a pretty good Indian that provides a more contempory experience to the traditional restaurant and if they figured out a way of serving meat that isn't overcooked to a high turnover of customers then I'd say it'd be excellent.This was my second visit and it was a more positive experience than the first one.\u00a340 for the two of us which includes 2 mains, rice, chapatis, sides, drinks, desserts and chais.",
