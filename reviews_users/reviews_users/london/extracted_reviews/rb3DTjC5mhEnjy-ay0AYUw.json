Of the two menus the one with the beer in is the most impressive, far better than you would think possible with the size of the bar but test the staff if you dare; I've never managed to find anything out of stock. The food menu is what you would expect, the mussels are excellent and the other standard fare (sausage and mash, burgers) is above average. This pub pulls into 4 stars territory though when you compare it with its competition, it knocks Beirodrome and the like for six in almost every category. The only exception being if you are looking for a more lively venue with more space.",

I had two or three drinks there earlier this week. Only little tiny beers. By the time we reached our next destination I was trollied. I can actually hold my beer better than most girly girls, so this was a bit of a shock. Until I discovered I was drinking an 8.5% beer and had no idea. Hehe! Fun though. And it's done nothing to quash my like of the place. It was busy, but cosy rather than rammed. The food was good (well, the chips were, we found ourselves looking longingly at the plates of mussels at the next table). A round is cheap, at \u00a314 for four drinks. I like like like all of these things. Staff aren't hugely helpful because there's so many beers and so much choice. Asking for a beer is complicated, but they do have menus. Unfortunately beer menus aren't ever as comprehensive as wine menus and I could be ordering anything. Like an 8.5% beer. But I like it. It's a great little bar and I'm pleased I've tried a new venue in Clerkenwell. I'll be back here. I'll eat all of their food and get accidentally drunk and be accidentally hungover the next day. And I'll probably enjoy every single minute of it. Again. Yay.",

The place was empty apart from us so the staff clearly didn't have much to do, though getting their attention was possibly the hardest thing in the world. I was promised the burgers were great, so i decided on a buffalo burger the order for which was (agreeing with gibbon here) reluctantly taken and half an hour later my food arrived. The burger was fine, nothing wrong with it but nothing spectacular and ended up being pretty expensive for what it was.

Anyway I went with my girlfriend and she loves belgian beer - Hoegaarden is her beer of choice, so she kind of tends to burp quite a lot in public. She's got a sweet tooth and developed a love for Belgian fruit beer while we were there which is why we ended up at the Dovetail. She calls it her local even though we live a good 25 minutes away. They sell all the fruit beers you could ever possibly want - mango, peach, cherry, apple - everything! Which is great if you like sort of thing. They also sell any belgian beer you could think of - I can't think of many. They do also sell cider which isn't very Belgian at all. I bought some chips there and they came in a glass \u00a0- that's apparently the Belgian way. You get a lot of \"city types\" because it's so close to the square mile but they're not too stuck up, I managed to a use only coppers to pay for a drink.So, go!

They've got Fruli on tap, Kwak, a long list of krieks, lambics and all sorts of other specialist Belgian beers. If you don't know what Fruli, Kwak, krieks, or lambics are, Dovetail's a brilliant place for the uninitiated to sample some of the best brews that Belgium has to offer. For those in the know, this is probably the best pub in town for Belgian beer. And its dark cavernous setting and walls lined with Tin-Tin posters creates the right Belgian vibe for a night of drinking. The food's good too \u00a0and really hearty. The chips are gorgeous, and the burgers exceptionally tasty (and impossible to eat with just your hands).",

The frites and mayo go down particularly well with a drinking audience. Sometimes they run out of the beers for the week, but with well over a hundred to choose from, you are sure to find something new and interesting to try.",

There must be ten pages of amazing belgian beers, from the fruit beers to the golden beers, from the wheat beers to the trappist and abbey ales they are all here! They're not ultra cheap, but they're not too expensive, and they pack a punch! 2. The food - there's a great selection of delicious, classic food, at low prices. Really nice belgian style chips, good chicken burger, it's all very nice. 3 The service - the barstaff are professional, knowledgeable, and nice. 4. The place itself - it's really nicely decorated, nice wooden tables, a few little alcoves, and a nice size - quite cosy. So basically, the dovetail is the bar to go to for belgian beer in london.

For me, the food is what makes the Dovetail so memorable. They have a lovely menu specialising in seafood, but they also have a lovely sausage and mash and Belgian burger section to the menu. The burgers are traditional Flemish burgers and are particularly delicious - the highlight being the wild boar burger. Unfortunately they have recently changed the relish they offer which isn't as good as it was before, but that aside this is one of the best places in London to eat. Don't leave without trying a pint of fries, which is their delicious home made chips served in a pint glass. The Dovetail is easy to miss, which is one of the reasons why it is such a nice little place. It's hidden away in a dark passage in Clerkenwell, but it's worth seeking out. It has a very rustic feel to it - it's almost like you're eating in an old dark cellar - albeit one that has been immaculately decorated with a tiled floor and pictures of Tintin adorning the walls. Not only does this place serve great food and drink, but it has character and personality. It's a true hidden gem. I'd avoid on a Friday night though as it's full of the Clerkenwell crowd just out of work, and there's nowhere to stand, let alone sit. Go at a lunchtime, an evening early in the week, or at a weekend and you'll be richly rewarded with great food, friendly staff and a truly memorable experience.",

Cute little bar right off clerkenwell with a little bit of outdoor seating; can't wait to make this place a regular haunt.",

We ordered fish & chips, the traditional burger, and steak sandwich. I was excited to try the chocolate fondue dessert, but alas we forgot to order before the kitchen closed. No worries, that just gives us an excuse to revisit the Dovetail. All in all, this is a great place. Nothing pretentious about it but at the same time the atmosphere is cozy. Pair that with good food and a great beer selection and I love love this place.",

    "text": "The Dovetail boasts an excellent range of Belgian beer, cosy interior, faithfully Belgian food, plenty of Belgian memorabilia but also a few quirks that stop it from attaining 5 star status.The beer range is impressive. Probably not quite up to Belgo's, but a very good effort, rather pleasingly including the likes of Delerium next to the usuals (e.g. Kwak, Duvel, Floris, Leffe, Tripel Karmaleit). On other hand, and unlike the tip-top of craft beer places (e.g. the Craft Beer Company bars) there's no guide to the beers in the beer menu, simply the names and prices, so you're effectively buying blind.The food is decent: tasty, authentically Belgian and good value. It'd be better if the waffles were made on the spot though rather than bought in and heated up.And the interior is cosy: candles, framed posters of Tintin covers and other mock-ups of Belgian beers to set the mood. The friendly and quick service rounds everything off.I can see why this is such a Yelp favourite!",

Well, there are a couple of factors involved. In no particular order...- After staking out a 'reserved' table for an hour or two, we were allowed to stay for dinner because whoever reserved it decided to no-show. Their loss.- A bottle of Straffe Hendrik doesn't cost \u00a315 (or whatever obscene price that Craft Beer Co. is charging for a pint of the same thing).- The servers are genuinely spunky and fun. I can forgive some butterfingers action and some glazed stares if you make me laugh and have a ready smile. Being cute doesn't hurt.- The fish 'n' chips are legitimately respectable. We're not talking about the same delightfulness you can score in Edinburgh, but hey... not all kitchens can be Scottish.NB: The above experience is a recollection (however fuzzy) of events after -literally- imbibing to the point where we were told they were utterly out of stock of the beer we were enjoying.",

After washing it all down with some Belgian beer, I was ready to negotiate a standing reservation. It was kind of amusing as everyone else at the restaurant seemed to be on a date but I guess during quieter times, this would make for a great date place. Better make a reservation to be safe!",

A heavyweight drinker I am not, but I think that slurring your words within an hour of being in a pub, is a bad sign.I 'thought' I was pretty hardcore after drinking my first blonde Belgian beauty, was feeling reasonable okay, 'I can handle this stuff, not sure what all the fuss is about.' Pahh, unbeknown to me I was slowly but surely unravelling, I just didn't know it!After my second glass of light coloured beer, I was feeling pretty good, however everything inside me said 'go home, go home!' Of course I didn't listen, and there I was half cut writing this review at 23:30 on the Victoria line home. Sad, but very true!",

It's an extension of my house, being that it's just opposite and the fact that everyone is a 'jolly nice chap' in there. It's pretty similar here, just further away from my doorstep. I came on a quite Saturday early evening to find a lovely pub hidden down a side street that serves up a wonderful selection of beers. This might think this seems a stupid thing to say if you know me well, as you'll also know that I don't drink beer, full stop. I do however enjoy a refreshing cider - The Dovetail has a selection of three rather lovely ciders.This place does get busy, as the night went on groups of friends and families thrust themselves around the large tables with buggies full of babies in tow.I came here and I drank. I didn't eat, although the food at the other tables did look wonderful. I'll be back.",

Probably wouldn't come here on my own dime. But, when drinking what amounts to the best beer in the world (i.e Belgian monk-made ales), prices like these should be expected.Just a warning for the Belgian ale newbies -- do not, I repeat, DO NOT drink Belgian beer as though you were drinking a regular pint. Belgian beer alcohol percentage ranges from 8-12%. Treat this drinking experience as though you're drinking wine. Drink slowly, savor the flavor, and keep it down to 2-3 max -- unless you want to end up like me. Praying to the porcelian gods the next day at work.Otherwise, it's a good ol time",

There are dark beers, light beers, fruity beers, sour beers. I could go on for a while. They boast over 101 types. Most of these will be in bottle but they have some beers on tap (such as the dangerous but lovely 'kwak'). These are a bit too expensive to want to drink here too often, but they are no higher than you would expect, given the specialist nature of the venue. Food looks quite good too. More than I would normally spend, but again it isn't exactly normal fare. You can get the classic moules frites if that kind of thing is to your taste. Personally I had one moule, once a long time agoand you will thank me for not describing the aftermath.",

It's set in a little alleyway off Clarkenwell opposite St John's Castle. The area is steeped in history and has a variety of other bars, restaurants and night clubs.The beer here is fantastic and again the Brugse Zot is the winner. Good selection on tap and plenty of bottled beers for tasting. Plenty of indoor seating plus a terrace outside where most people stand and drink. The food here is the best with proper Belgian style chips with ketchup and mayo. Good sized portions with a daily special.

The Dovetail and I, we just fit together...and conveniently, it's located fairly close to my office, but even if it weren't, I'd find my way back here. The Belgian siren song is fierce, my friends. So let's see, my most recent outing involved a Duvel, a few Saisons, some blonde beers, maybe a Leffe? Wow, now that I think about it -- I lost count. Which probably explains the drunk dial to my mum on the walk home and waking up snuggled with the dog on the sofa at 3am. Guess there are worse outcomes eh!? I guess I had some fun. Make a booking! We lucked out on a recent Thursday night but unless you'd like to hang outside in the lovely old Jerusalem Passage (it really is quite nice), call ahead to book a spot, particularly for the eats. The menu is pretty heavy (cheese fondue? deep fried avocado? anyone anyone?) -- but there are some light bites to be had for those that want them (the miso glazed salmon was pretty spot on), and even a few veg-friendly plates. BUT THE BEER. Man, it will punch you in the face if you aren't careful. Read your labels (or don't), and pace yourselves. 3x I've been, the service has been pretty great given the fact that its usually pretty busy with folks clammoring for more of those face punchers. A fun night out with pals, after work spot, a festive spot to kick back and enjoy a few. Don't say I didn't warn you though, you'll be hooked. Belgians do it up right in the beer department.",

In fact, double that, as our waitress was amazing and tolerated many \"just one more\" orders. Fair play.Smokers get to hang out and hang easy in the cool alleyway out front. Next to the bins, sure, but that's what we deserve. (Love hate relationship with the cigs.) The range of beers is huge and I was not careful to remember which individual tipples I tried -- to be fair, I started out on a lager around 4.5 percent (because, can't drink on an empty stomach) then my steadfast refusal for the tougher stuff waned and I ordered something crafty at 6 percent ish. Either way, all the sips are sound.Sadly, they'd run out of beef burgers, so I had the bison. It was really good -- sturdy, huge, trimmed well, but alas, a little too gamey to finish. Solid chips. Decent array of eats. My friend had a cauliflower burger, which you might sniff at, but seriously -- I made the wrong choice. I think cauli is the new brussels sprout, lads.Anyway -- love this spot.

Heading off here for afterwork drinks on a Thursday we were lucky to get a table with it being pretty busy by 6 and a lot reserved for later (book ahead peeps) but from this point we were nicely settled in and made it into quite the epic evening. The food was fairly rustic Belgian fair, I enjoyed digging into the cheese fondue as a starter and the steak baguette was good for a main - but I wish I'd spent more time looking at the menu (as opposed to gabbing away with my friends first off...) as there looked to be some pretty interesting things going on there. Fun conversations with friends mixed with tasty Belgian IPA, white Chimay and lots of random stubby bottles with foreign names scribbled on them made this a super fun night.",

    "text": "I walk by this place everyday to work and everytime I pass by I feel like getting in for a quick gulp of some delicious Belgian beer, irrespective of the time of the day. Not to mention, their Belgian cuisine which includes some authentic ones such as Antwerp fish stew. \u00a0They also have daily employee recommendations on a blackboard inside. The whole pub also has a Belgian pub lane feel to it, kind of like the famous Delirium of Grote Markt in Brussels. There are also some trappist murals on the pub wall if I remember correctly. This place is quite packed on most evenings, and unlike most London pubs, even if the pub is full, you can drink beer on the lane outside. For history buffs (which I also happen to be!), this place is located on a street (or more of a passage) called Jerusalem passage (zythophile.co.uk/2010/02\u2026) with a plaque dedicated to 'Thomas Britton, the musical coalman'. There is also the chic St Johns square next to it.",

    "text": "The Dovetail is one of those magical bars that beckons you in off the street and the longer you stay the harder it is to leave. Their wide range of strong lager and simple but effective food may be responsible for this magic formula.They have more fruit beer on offer than many bars have normal beer. I feel that this is part of the draw of The Dovetail. Every time you go to the often packed bar you can come back with something different. Try the apple beer, the name escapes me (not because I was drunk) but ask the chatty bar staff who will be able to assist you on your quest. We had grub at The Dovetail. Some of our group are locals and weren't aware that The Dovetail did food but I can assure you that it does food well. For main I had a hotdog wrapped in Parma ham and feta. The meal was excellent, served with real pace and eaten even quicker. I was a fan of The Dovetail as you can probably tell. It harvested an extremely relaxed, casual atmosphere and is the perfect post work destination.",

Posters of Tintin on the walls, vintage \"Westmalle\" drink menus, these details clearly made me think of an old \"bistrot\" as we call them back home. The amount of draught and bottled beers is pretty amazing as well. The place is pretty big and monday isn't specifically the busiest nights, and so it kind of felt \"cold\"..so I'll have to come back later during the week (or this might just be a good excuse :) Location is very convenient though, and I guess it's just nice to know that whenever I feel homesick, I can come here and drown my sorrows in a good old belgian triple !

I ordered the bison burger with spicy tomato & rodenbach relish (\u00a310.95) The menu said the meat was \"naturally 97% fat free and 40% more protein than a beef burger\" definitely in keeping with my \"weekday\" diet. You real foodies will not appreciate this but...I also swapped up the brioche bun and chips for seasonal vegetables and salad, which they surprisingly had no problem with! Verdit? It's a pretty damn good burger despite the lack of carbs to pack it out (the picture proves that the healthier alternative still looks appetising!!)Overall a low key chilled pub, non invasive service to let us get on with gossiping and generous portions of food including alternatives for the health conscious! But next time I really should try some of the beers!Bonus: The Zetter townhouse is also just round the corner if the beers just aren't hitting the spot...",
