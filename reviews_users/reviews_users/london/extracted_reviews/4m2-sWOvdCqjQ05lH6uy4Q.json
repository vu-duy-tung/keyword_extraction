I too felt the lack of customer service at the bar, there were 3 people behind there all huddled together and discussing the days takings or what ever, however after a while we were serviced welcomely and efficiently with good advice. The food was exceptional for pub grub and the 'London gold' was on good form. next round was the same issue the two barmaids were huddled together again and gave the immpresion we were blanked (as previous review), but when you had their attention things were great. We would visit again and we are able to reccomend to anybody thinking about visiting, as the food is good and the beer we had was also good 'London gold'. \"Rating marked as a pub with grub\"",

    "text": "This small pub opposite the British Museum has a delightful mid-Victorian interior, full of polished mahogany and etched mirrors and stained glass. Although there has been a pub on the site since the early 18th century: a tavern named the Dog and Duck was recorded here in 1723, although it may have sold liquor before that. The present name was adopted in 1862, after the Museum was built. The interior dates from a refit around 1855, by the architect William Finch Hill. Although refitted several times since, many of his elaborately carved woodwork fittings survive. The pub has a formidable choice of real ales which, on a recent visit, included Timothy Taylor, Fuller's London Pride, Theakston's Old Peculier, Sharp's Doom Bar, Golden Promise Organic, and Bombardier. Although I'd normally say this was a good thing, the quality of one or two of the ales wasn't tip-top \u00a0a couple fewer with faster turnover might be better. They do a range of traditional pub food, with the sausage and mash being recommended (though it is a while since I have eaten here). It gets very busy (and touristy) during the day when the museum is open, but is generally much quieter after 8pm, when you stand a chance of finding a seat. Toilets are all down steep stairs and are not accessible for those with impaired mobility. (I suppose you could always have a pint and nip across to the Museum itself, though the access is via self-operated chair lifts). The only real downside was the service: very efficient, but definitely without a smile. I presume this is something to do with being in such a touristy location \u00a0but a smile surely costs nothing? We weren't even wished good-night as we left",

They have changed the layout sometime in the last year removing the big pews and large tables that could sit 6-8 people.

The pub was a bit hot in temperature, but the management assured us the heating wasn't on, and we made do by taking off as many layers as possible and making sure to have some ice (though it didn't stay ice very long) water with our beers. When everyone is sweating through their shirt, it isn't as embarrassing as if you're doing it on your own. The selection of beers were quite good, and everyone in the group was able to find something to enjoy... even our Lager (bleh!) drinkers. :PThe atmosphere was good.

Other than that, despite it's proximity to the British Museum (across the street), there are barely any tourists here and the places is relatively quiet. It's definitely a nice resting spot after seeing the sites and I feel like it's location deters most people from going in, which is why it's so peaceful and nice when you actually go in.",

Fortunately, it's also one of the better Greene King pubs, with a larger than usual range of hand-pumped ales and lagers, friendly staff, and solid (if streamlined) food at only slightly elevated prices. Despite the popular location, the Museum Tavern is no tourist trap. You will also find the d\u00e9cor of this historic pub to be pleasant and cozy, so it can be considered a place to linger with your friends or family. There are rather few other pubs nearby, none of them as good as this one - so I recommend it strongly.",

Our table was waiting, a good move as the pub was crowded. (There is outside seating, but the rain was not conducive to it this evening.) Despite it being in a heavily visited and touristed location, I would say that predominately locals were here after work. The wooden bar and fittings give it the perfect British pub atmosphere. Recommended to other visitors to London.I placed our food order at the bar and it was served at our table. I ordered the Ultimate Fish and Chips. A nice cod fillet was accompanied by mushy peas, pickled onions, curry sauce and tartar sauce. It was very good!The Museum Tavern is something of a museum itself. The pub dates to 1723 and has operated under its present name since 1755. The present building dates to 1855.",

We seated ourselves and then I grew annoyed with a sign that said \"order at the bar\" because this was first described to me as a place you could sit down. \u00a0However, a waitress did end up coming over to us and taking our food order, even giving us a specific time of when it would be ready. The inside of this place is extremely cute. It has a nice vibe and there were a lot of people standing around and drinking that seemed to be regulars that enjoyed this place. I ended up getting the Hunter's Chicken which was Grilled chicken breast topped with smoked streaky bacon, Cheddar cheese & BBQ sauce. Served with chips, onion rings, house coleslaw and a dressed salad garnish. \u00a0This meal was done well. \u00a0I enjoyed that it came with chips and onion rings and the prices were very reasonable. \u00a0We also tried the Louisiana Burrito which was a tortilla wrap filled with grilled seasoned vegetables, mixed beans and chillies with coriander & parsley rice, infused with smoked paprika, garlic, oregano & lemon. Mixed with crisp lettuce, mature Cheddar cheese & sour cream. It also came with some very good crisps. I then wanted to get dessert to go, which seemed like a foreign concept for the waitress. \u00a0She asked what I wanted and I told her Apple Crumble and she said that would be fine. \u00a0Once we paid and I got the Apple Crumble we left. \u00a0I did not look at the Apple Crumble until I got back and when I did it looked absolutely disgusting and like someone else had already eaten it. \u00a0That got thrown away fairly quickly. Overall, a \u00a0nice place for a pub. \u00a0Very small cute decorations, average food.",

Reviews don't do this place justice. \u00a0It is small but everything I imagined in a pub in London. \u00a0Short walk from the British Museum. \u00a0Super friendly server and it was packed and our food came out fast and hot! \u00a0Chicken and mushroom open face sandwich was a hit but the real crowd pleaser was the fresh hot and huge order of fish and chips! Cooked perfectly with a light and crunchy batter made it by far the best in town! \u00a0Cold beer hot food friendly staff they earned a 5 star review.",

    "text": "I am not hyping this when I say that this was LITERALLY the BEST fish and chips I've ever had. I've had my fair share of fish and chips from places all over California and in Ireland. This place is literally right across the British museum and after being so hungry I was so glad I found this place. The place was however, extremely busy and there was literally only one waitress taking care of over 50+ people and their orders. Which I didn't understand why there was only one person. But me and my friend patiently waited and was seated within 10 minutes or so.Before coming in we both saw the ultimate fish and chips plate and agreed that it was what we were ordering. It comes with a large fried fish, lots of chips, peas, bread and butter and curry and tartar sauce.First of all I was just impressed with how much was on the plate. And I've never had curry sauce with fish and chips and boy was it delicious! The fish was AMAZING. Fried to perfection to say the least. It wasn't soggy and the fish had the perfect seasoning too. The chips were crispy on the outside and well done on the instead. The peas were a good compliment with all the fried food being stuffed into my mouth. I couldn't have been more pleased.Come here. You won't regret the 15\u00a3.",

The signs say to grab a table anywhere. Our waitress was very kind. She explained the different ciders to me. The menu is pretty diverse from fish and chips to burritos. I had the lamb shank shepherds pie. It was hot and comforting on this particular cold day. The gravy on the side was rich and delicious. The peas and carrots on the side I could've done without. The prices are very fair. I was expecting them to be a little more with the proximity to the museum, but was pleasantly surprised.",

This place is exactly what I think of when I imagine having a pint in a British pub. The Cod and chips could have been more flavorful, but the price is right so who am I to complain? Not to mention they have some pretty good stuff on tap and weren't at all offended when I decided to order a water instead. I would probably make a stop in to this place the next time I am in London, if for no other reason than its authentic pub aesthetic.",
