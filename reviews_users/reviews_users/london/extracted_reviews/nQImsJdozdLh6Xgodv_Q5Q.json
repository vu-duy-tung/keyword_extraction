    "text": "Great rock n roll atmosphere. We had drinks in the basement bar before eating which were really tasty and delivered by a very helpful and friendly barman. When we sat down to eat the menu all lolled great so we needed reconditions. We ordered chicken wings, prawn toast, octopus tacos, lamb ribs and iberico pork. Each dish was delicious in their own right.Be prepared for LOTS of flavour. A restaurant with this angle on the cuisine that's what you're really hoping for anyway (?!)Also dishes are quite small. This was fine for us as we wanted to try lots of things almost tapas style, and it was a date night so price wasnt as much of a concern. But if you want a place to fill you up with one dish maybe look elsewhere.Great to try lots of tasty dishes out in a cool atmosphere for something different.",

This to me is again a version of Japanese where chefs and restaurant entrepreneurs want to pass off mediocre food and charge high prices by labeling it Japanese. We went on a Wed afternoon in April and the place was barely occupied, sensible people who stayed away unlike us. We tried almost all the popular dishes or rather those restaurant critics had reviewed , will stop reading the Bloomberg reviews and use my own judgement going forward.",

Rich, sweet flavours that I gobbled too although the aubergine was a little to chewy for my palate.The bad: My husband's main dish was awful. AVOID THE MAC AND CHEESE. What a waste of \u00a38. Barely cooked pasta under a meh topping. He also got the scallop- yes a scallop- because paying \u00a38 for one should be a crime, The scallop was nice but there were also these bits of rubbery fish??? scallop bits??? around it that turned us off.The worst was the service (of course Europe, you NEVER FAIL). Our waitress just ended her shift midway and never bothered to tell us. So after sitting and waiting for some time for our food, drink refills, ANY acknowledgement, we flagged another waitress and she let us know, that yeah, our server had left and she had our section now. No apologies or anything. So we had to repeat our orders.I had the 12.5% tip that is automatically added taken off immediately. We will never return and I urge others to avoid as well.",

We all had the salmon bento and the staff were very accommodating to our 45min time limit. Salmon was perfectly flaky and moist. I loved the yuzu Mayo dip. The rice was al dente and dotted with mushrooms and other extras... Much like a stir fry. And the taco. Wow! Pretty spicy and chewy. I was worried it would break apart in my hand as there was so much filling but it held its own. Love this place, so glad it became permanent and is a worthy addition to Old Compton Street. If you're wary of strong flavours and spicy food, choose a lighter menu option but otherwise, two thumbs up for shackfuyu.",

Really fresh octopus with some great combinations going on.Monkfish cheeks were okay. Just a few chunks of fried fish with lemon mayo.Pork cheeks were actually quite good but I felt something was missing. We also had the steak which was a let down. It was overcooked and chewy. We ordered medium rare but it came out medium well. Now the dessert. This is exceptional. Really delicious toast with the perfect sweetness which also balances really well with the matcha ice cream.",

We were kinda lazy, so we just went for the tasting menu, which gives a nice overview of what they have to offer. For the price of \u00a330,- this is a real good value, as it is plenty. You get around 8 dishes to share plus a dessert. All dishes were real flavor bombs. It wasn't the most refined cuisine, but it delivered on big flavors. The atmosphere was really cool with loud rock music. Service was great as well: very friendly and efficient.",

We were going to hop across the road in Soho New York style just to get dessert. And not any dessert. A dessert I had heard was worth going to Shackfuyu alone.As we hopped across, informing the staff if they could fit us four somewhere and that we would only have to dessert they were more than welcoming. Getting us a nice table in the back lively room.The dessert? Oh yeah that....well it was a soft serve Matcha Green Tea with some Kinako French Toast. We could see them putting it on the plate Mr Whippy style as the machine was next to us. And boy was it worth the effort. In fact one dessert is more than enough for two people! It was the perfect guilty pleasure. Had to do a run the next day just to make myself feel like I wasn't going into a soft serve dream. I love the Japanese pop ups and this Bone Daddies spin off is worth going just for that.",

The food came speedily and was really delicious BUT so so small and quite pricey.Korean wings had a good spice, slathered in sticky sauce. The yellowtail sashimi, tiny but really tasty. We shared a bunch of starters between 5 of us so got a good selection, the Mac and cheese was an unexpected highlight (Japanese food with Mac and cheese? Yes, delicious).My margarita was \u00a38.50 which is pretty steep for my liking. Yet I did loudly exclaim frequently how delicious it was. We ordered pudding at the end but after 30minute wait we cancelled the order as we had a film to catch.Basically this place is tasty, but too pricey for the portion size, accompanied with the wait for the table means I can only give it 3 stars! If you don't care about these then certainly go for it.",

    "text": "So Shackfuyu is doing a re-opening and I'm lucky enough to book a place for lunch today at their soft launch.I haven't been here before but looking at previous photos of the place I would say the place is more chic and the layout now makes it look bigger (might have something to do with the huge mirror at the back of the restaurant).Staff are quite well trained, although they did try to bring the same dish to our table twice. Not sure if this is staff error or kitchen error. Polite \u00a0service throughout. The food came quite quickly as well, although not in any particular order. We had the curry potato, then duck bun first, and then the iron steak, then the chicken last. They all came separately on their own.We had the duck, flat iron steak and kimchi chicken bun between 2 people. We also had the curry potato. These are enough to fill you up and make you fall into a food coma!!Props to the flat iron steak, it melts in your mouth and is great coupled with the radish. Kimchi chicken is second and even a non-kimchi lover myself, the chicken was juicy and succulent inside and it was a huge piece of chicken! Duck was disappointing as the piece was too small and due to this the deep frying made it feel like I was eating fried duck skin!!Curry potato was addictive as it uses those Japanese curry which is slightly sweet.All in all, a good place for lunch!",

    "text": "I like Shackfuyu, it has all the makings of a good soho joint, which these days ALWAYS ALWAYS include a basement bar. As we arrived quite late around 9ish, we were asked to make our way down there with a buzzer and to get some drinks whilst we wait. The drinks were amazing, the cherry sake was really special. The only thing was- were they pre-made? Because the bartender didn't um, bartend, he kinda reached into the fridge and poured it into the glass. None of that fancy cocktail pizzazz, which is a total shame.The wait wasn't long at all, but then again it was quite a late weeknight. The food here can be hit and miss, there were dishes I absolutely fell head of heels in love with- the smoked duck ham which I think was only on their daily specials. It was smoky and flavourful and I genuinely cried when we finished the plate. Like previous reviewers here, I felt a lot of the food was oversalted- the aubergine, the mentaiko mac and cheese etc. Note to self: Don't order the tacos- they're not worth it. (Also \u00a32.50 PER TINY TACO- NO!)The wings were alright but there are so many better wings places in London that Shackfuyu's offering pales in comparison. Now, I won't lie, the main reason I dragged my friend here was for the Kinako French toast, mainly because people on my instagram keep taking pictures of it. And it didn't disappoint, soft serve green tea with sesame French toast. It was SO good, not too sweet, if anything I would've preferred a smaller portion.I think Shackfuyu has some great things going, but the food needs to step up a bit, especially given the price that they expect people to pay. Also a bartender with more pizzazz.",

Monkfish cheeks were crunchy, flavourful and yummy. Beef tartare had too much egg to meat ratio, in other words, more meat required! Loved the crackers it came with.Sweet potato fries were the best I've tried and I don't even like them! The sauce they come with was something else, in fact, all dips were great. Salmon bun was good chicken bun was stupid spicy, covered with hot sauce with kimchee. Seriously. No. Can't taste the chicken!!The dessert was amaaaazing!!

I'd recommend all of those things! Actually, come to think of it, I ordered a second helping of the fried wings. I also ordered an edamame which took a while to come out, so the waitress brought over a complimentary beet salad while I waited - nice touch and also really good.

With the rock and roll themed of the venue, plus the Soho location and decent services, it is hard to imagine Shackfyyu not be a success. But bear in mind that this isn't a cheap restaurant, without the soft launch offer, my bill would have costed me almost \u00a350 with just tap water to drink. But then again you are getting some of the very best modern East Asian cooking in London at that price bracket.",

The place was packed, but we were kindly asked to wait at the downstairs bar and got a table after a short 10 minute wait.The menu offers a selection of, what can be best described as Japanese style Tapas. We ordered the Aubergine, Mac and cheese, Edamame, Picanha beef, curry potatoes, and prawn toast. All dishes were served quickly and I would recommend them all! Especially the Aubergine and beef! Absolutely amazing!Dont miss out on their french toast and green tea soft ice cream dessert, which is definitely the best pudding you will ever try!!I will go back as soon as possible! Great service, amazing food!",

This one specializes in Japanese izakaya or tapas.I absolutely loved the aubergine, soaked in a deep rich sauce that screamed umami. Then came the spicy and delicious chicken wings. Messy so you will need the wet nap they bring but mighty tasty! Prawn toast was surprisingly original and filling. It was a good take on okonomiyaki, super savory. I would skip the hamachi cheeks. It was a bit bland and not cooked consistently throughout.My previous visit here allowed me to try one of their tasty baos and the ramen salad. It was perfect for lunch, hitting all the right notes. Service was quick and we were upgraded to a table. I will definitely be back to try more dishes and their intriguing cocktail menu. Keep it coming!",

It was not surprising that the 6 other people at the bar had also come to order just this item.The french toast was warm, gooey and not overly sweet. It was the perfect pairing with the cold authentic tasting green tea ice cream, which also was also the perfect amount of sweetness. Would definitely come back to try other items and order this dessert again.",

    "text": "My second Asia-centric BBB (bottomless boozy brunch) and the Bone Daddies crew did not disappoint. Foodwise, Shackfuyu is Japanese street food with a twist, serving izakaya (Japan's version of small plates/tapas). They have Korean friend wings slathered in a creamy chili sauce. Crunchy, hot, and lusciously doused with sauce. Spectacular. They have prawn toast 'masquerading' as okonomiyaki (Japanese friend cabbage omelette)....it's good, TRUST. And confit duck leg in those cute tiny rice burger buns - you know the ones. I got the hot stone rice with beef for the larger dish and was underwhelmed. It was crispy because it was overcooked to the point of just not being pleasant to eat. The aubergine was gorgeous. Sweet and tangy miso glaze with little bits of puffed rice giving it the crunch it needed.For \u00a339 it was a bargain given that along with limitless wine/beer/prosecco, you get a choice of as many small starter dishes as you want, a larger main, as well as the classic (and only dessert worth commendation here) crispy, syrupy French toast with soft serve Matcha green tea flavoured ice cream. Brilliance at its best. However, I don't think I'd give it 4 stars if I were paying full price per dish. Especially given that many dishes are uninspired. The kale and cucumber salad was under-dressed and boring and the brocolli tenderstem had a lovely dressing but not quite sure I'd pay for that dish alone. Did I mention you also get a Japanese bloody mary (inclusive) upon arrival? Not very strong but definitely how every good brunch should begin.",

Unsurprisingly, those 2 dishes were my favorites among the ones that my friend and I ordered. I wouldn't say that the izakaya here is particularly authentic, but there are a couple items on the menu which are quite creative and unique.// Scallop Sashimi (\u00a38.8) - 2 starsThe sauce was too salty, overpowering the subtle flavors of the scallop. I think they added too much soy sauce.// Stonebass (\u00a314.70) - 3 starsSomewhat pricey, although they do serve a sizable portion. I thought the fish itself was a little bland as I found myself wanting more chili ponzu.// Prawn Toast Masquerading as Okonomiyaki (\u00a36.4) - 4 starsI wouldn't have believed it if you told me that this was actually prawn toast. It legit tasted like okonomiyaki - very interesting!// Kinako French Toast with Soft Serve Ice Cream (\u00a37) - 5 starsThe only dessert available on the menu is a must-try! Comes sprinkled with kinako (roasted soybean powder) and a generous dollop of matcha ice cream. It's the perfect Japanese spin on a Western treat.",

I do remember the 'prawn toast masquerading as okonomiyaki', 'endive and pear salad' and 'pork cheeks' being quite tasty and the 'kinako french toast with matcha soft serve ice cream' being overrated but pleasant enough if the toast isn't burnt (which happened on one of my visits). The buns on the lunchtime menu are also of a good size and with satisfying fillings.\u00a0In conclusion, Shackfuyu does to Japanese dining what Dishoom does to Indian cuisine; it gives the food a different take and presents them in tapas like portions and therefore makes for an interesting meal. However, Shackfuyu ends up being somewhat more expensive yet not as memorable or comfortable as it should be.",

Their kinako French toast with soft serve ice cream dessert is so delicious! Kinako is a soybean flour that is used in Japanese mochi desserts and drinks. It has a roasted flavor to it. They sprinkled that generously on the French toast to enhance the taste of the French toast. Pairing the warm toast with the icy old green tea ice-cream is a \"match-a\" made in heaven! Get it? No? Okay... I was speechless after I took the first bite. I quickly devoured the dessert wishing that there was more to munch on. They also have a pretty good beer and wine selection. When I went that night, it was really busy and I thought the service was not that attentive. That was the only thing I wish they can improve on. I definitely want to come back whenever I visit London again. They have a lot of other dishes on the menu that I want to try!I recommend checking this place out if you are near Leicester Square!

I am a big fan of the Bone Daddies chain - check out my reviews of Bone Daddies as well as Flesh & Buns - so I had big expectations for this one. This is actually one of my friend's fav restaurant too, she keep raving about it, but I never for a chance to head there. Finally made it with her, so she knew what to order and I trusted her blindly.... And boy did I do the right thing, everything we had was extraordinary. I mean it wasn't just well done but the flavours were insane & the meat always cooked to absolute perfection. She started by ordering the prawn crackers & the miso aubergine. To be honest, I questioned that choice. I mean prawn crackers? Cant be that special, right? And aubergine? Not really a fan of that vegetable and also not the kind to order veggie side dishes. Oh boy! That prawn cracker was insane, unlike any other prawn cracker you've ever tried. And that aubergine? OH BOY! Never thought aubergine could taste this good! Turned to the meat - highly highly recommend the picanha. Breathtaking meat! Quality of the meat is insane, but then add the BBQ sauce, the mushrooms and the dipping sauce made of raw yolk & soya! MIAM MIAM! I could have that all day everyday! I want it all day everyday! Also worth a mention - the monkfish tail (oh god, never had a monkfish cooked this well, very simple. as opposed to the other dishes its not overpowered by a sauce, just pure monkfish), Iberico pork & the sticky fatty lamb ribs! Oh and of course the korean chicken wings (same as Flesh & Buns), could literally drink that sauce! Worth mentioning went another time and replaced the lamb ribs with the beef ribs - not as good im afraid. Of course it was tasty but much more ordinary than the lamb or anything else on the menu. Seabass ceviche was good also but nothing to write on really. And to be fair if you want ceviche there's better places in town. Finally, one dessert on the menu only - french toast with matcha ice cream. VERY good too and nice little sweet touch to finish this insane meal. But if you have to cut out some savoury dishes in order to get the dessert, I would recommend against!",

    "text": "The all new Japanese fusion restaurant by the founders of Bone daddies. If you think it's going to be just ramen you're wrong \u00a0because it's better. For starters we had Spicy friend Korean chicken wings and taco tacos, both really good and appetising. The octopus is so fresh and it goes so well with the crunchy tacos with tangy dressing.For mains we had the grilled yellow tail cheek which had so much fish meat it filled me up pleasantly. The wafu beef steak was so soft and juicy, so definitely worth the price. To top it all was the unique kinako toast with lovely matcha soft ice cream, even though I was so full this is unmissable and it's worth waiting, but best to share with two people minimum as it's not small!",

    "text": "I went to shackfuyu on an early Sunday evening and the restaurant was packed but the bar was empty and I was alone so I was seated right away and my order was taken right away. I only wanted to try the french toast with kinako powder and matcha soft serve and I quickly got my plate with a huge portion on it. It's to die for so don't miss it but share between two people!It is a warm piece of thick brioche bread soaked in a coconut milk based custard and caramelised. The edges are crisp and the insides soft and goey and utterly delicious. the soft serve is quite strong in matcha and balances perfectly the sweetness of the bread. The kinako powder which usually tends to be dry is offset by the moistness of the bread and ice cream and brings a nutty taste to the dessert, making it a perfect dish. I wish I could have finished it but I was so full I just couldn't manage it!",

    "text": "I liked my meal here. It's not the best or most authentic Izakaya in London, but it is not bad at all.- I loooved the scallop sashimi and the fried monkfish cheeks. - The nasu (aubergine) was also delicious, and easier to eat than most places as it was already chopped up.- The beef, bibimbap dish was yummy too.- The kale, cucumber and crack dressing* was good, but that was down to the dressing.I guess the main problem was that it was so busy that we had to wait about 40mins for a table. I'd bump it up to 4 stars if it was slightly easier to get a table. I'm just not a fan of having to wait around to eat in the \"cool\" places. *One of friends calls the gorgeous sesame salad dressing \"crack dressing\" because it is just soooo good. Once I brought a MASSIVE bottle of it back from Japan. While we were in the airport (just before customs) I checked to see if my \"bottle of crack\" had leaked in my luggage, and then shouted over to my husband, \"yay the crack is all safe.\" Oops. He was really pissed off with me. Anyway, just try the sesame dressing whenever you get the chance. It's *that* good.",

    "text": "I finaaaaally have ticked off Shackfuyu from my must try list. And the conclusion of my experience: you MUST try. The place itself is decorated nicely with good lighting over the tables. On entry you are greeted and shown to your table. At the front of the restaurant is the bar, in the middle there are plenty of round tables in booths for 6 people, then at the back there are a few high benches with backless chairs and then tables of 2. These tables are a little odd however as you sit next to the person rather than opposite. The waiter came over and explained the concept - Japenese tapas so all dishes are made to share - and then gave us time to peruse the menu, which isn't big but has plenty of choice. We knew we were going to get some plates which I had read about from other reviews however we also had some questions as to what some dishes were. The waiters are all very friendly, patient, attentive and had no problem explaining some of the dishes I wasn't sure about and then also offering his opinion when asked. In the end we went for the Gini Hendrix cocktail and nagaiita beer (quite sweet but a little different) and then 5 dishes. They recommend 4-5 between 2 with the idea you can always order more but we were starving so went straight in for 5! The dishes come out as and when they're ready so first up the rabbit doughnuts arrived which I thought were fantastic however bf wasn't so keen and I agree they weren't really in keeping with the rest of the menu. Out next came the sweet potato fries and prawn toast - again both yuuuuummy. Next up was my absolute fav and the most expensive dish we ordered: wagyu beef which came in a hot stone bowl with caramelised onions and mushrooms. It cooked itself in front of you and the smell was divine. The taste was equally good - a must if you're willing to splash out. Finally the aubergine came out which was a massive dish for the price and you'd never believe you could make aubergine taste so good. It was covered in a sticky bbq sauce with small crisp balls on top adding another awesome texture - another definite must. If you like fish (which I don't) there were some impressive looking dishes which came out. And still there are more meat dishes which we didn't get which I am dying to go back and try - lamb ribs, pork cheeks and rice & beef to name a few. For dessert we got the famous one and only dessert on the menu: French toast with matcha soft serve ice cream. It was amazing! And of course I got a photo for Instagram! Overall we had a fantastic meal with good service and came away so so full. I would probably give it a 9*/10 as the bill did come to a rather pricey amount but am definitely going back and recommend you do too!",

    "text": "I was so excited about going to Shackfuyu. Dishes inspired by Oriental flavours creating fusion dishes such as the infamous French toast topped with grated roasted soy beans served with matcha soft whipped icecream.But sadly many of the dishes was so drowned with miso or salt that it made some of the dishes really uncomfortable to eat unless washed down with lots of water. But what is the fun in that? Starting with the kale and cucumber in sesame sauce. I wish I could taste the freshness and the flavours of the cucumber but sadly the dish was so salty it masked everything. I wasn't so keen on the kale in the first place being too rough on the tongue and maybe would have stuck with spinach leaves or blanched French beans for a softer texture.The Korean wings were a better choice. Lightly crisp on the outside whilst keeping the chicken succulent and juicy in the inside. The flavours were also balanced. Not too overwhelming. A lovely dish to get your fingers messy with.Prawn toast masquerading as okonomiyaki could have been an amazing creation if I could scope off some of the sauce. Generous with the prawns it was juicy and bouncy yet crispy at the same time. The texture was perfect even with the sauce to add that creaminess but sadly it was just so overpowering the flavours of the prawns were lost in there.I was shocked how I was expected to eat the aubergine on its own. At this point I had already went through 3 cups of water and wished they served bowls of plain boiled rice to take some of the salt away. Don't get me wrong I love the combination of different miso. I enjoy the sweetness and the saltiness but it just wasn't balanced. It was far more on the salty side than anything else. It only needed half the miso that was in there and definitely no more seaweed to make it more salty.Saving the day was my favourite dish of the evening, the hamachi Kama. Lovely flakey soft meat from the collar of a yellowtail, just lightly seasoned and grilled. Served with a lemon which I gently squeeze over the collar brought out the amazing freshness and flavours of the yellowtail. Highly highly recommend!Back on the road to high blood pressure was the hot stone rice. Why ruin a dish that had so much potential by drowning it in miso. The texture was brilliant with the beef, the mushrooms, raw egg and other vegetables. I can just make out how the flavours could have blended in my mouth. If I could only taste it. Water please!Putting thar aside I found a dish I would come back for, the sukiyaki style wagyu picanha. If they had ruin such a high quality piece of beef I think I would have sulked all night. Luckily they didn't. Ahhhh... Beautiful juicy tender slices of wagyu still marbling in the hot stone bowl in a lovely sweet soy marinate. The whole idea is that you dip it in the raw egg so that the beef holds on to the sauce and moisture creating an epic sensation as you devour it.The only plate that was a mix bag was the pork cheeks. No it wasn't too salty this time. What let it down was the cooked persimmon and pickled cucumbers that just did not pair well with the dish. The persimmon somewhat tasted 'off' and miso does not go well with pickles for me. Brushing those side bits off, the dish was well executed. The cheeks were moist, juicy and the meaty flavour travelled through the sauce to create a flavoursome dish. Now the final dish needs to introduction. Kinako french toast they call it lives up to its name. Those who know me knows I love hot matched with cold dessert or visa versa. With the love of matcha, soft whipped icecream and French toast it was impossible to not love this dish. Would I return to Shackfuyu? Yes, but sadly I will have to turn my head away to half the dishes on the menu. But when the seasoning is right, their dishes really do shine and are so very moreish. Pretty please can you cut down on your salt!!!",
