Not that it wasn't good, but I did think the meat lacked the punch that I'm used to. \u00a0I mean, all the usual post-meal symptoms (bloating, chest tightening, greasy face ooze, increased feelings of shame) were present, it just wasn't quite as satisfying as I know they can be. \u00a0It may just have been the particular day, but I wonder if they source their stuff from the same place. \u00a0Despite that though, it's still better than most and the lack of wait would bring a smile to Jay Rayner's face. \u00a0I'll be interested to see how the quality holds up at any further branches of P&B - hopefully this one's just a minor blip.",

I've had the burger at the London Fields branch as well as delivered via Deliveroo, via the Liverpool st. branch.The fries are really interesting, with one option being chicken skin salt flavour fries - this is basically a seasoning made out of salt and ground up bits of crispy chicken skin, which may sound weird but is pretty delicious - the chicken gives the seasoning an umami like taste and the chicken skin flavoured mayo is also pretty satisfying. Also liked the rosemary fries.In terms of the burger, it can get a bit soggy as there is a lot of juice coming out of the meat + sauce inside but other than that it's pretty much a 5 star burger - great charred flavour meat, gooey cheese and great spicy mayo sauce. I've also tasted the veggie burger as my sister is a vegetarian and she said it is easily one of the best veggie burgers she's ever had, especially compared to similar veggie options as places like Byron and so on. The veggie is basically a deep fried battered mushroom sandwiched in between bits of a garlicky, almost truffle-y creamy sauce - delicious.",

My favourite is the Smokey Robinson (their bacon burger). They cook the beef patty to your liking; they recommend medium and I go with that. I like the burger as a whole because of the juicy patty, the P&B mayo and, of course, the bacon. The bun holds up well and doesn't turn soggy (like I have experienced at other places).It gets quite busy at lunchtimes given its prime location outside Liverpool Street station. They have an efficient takeaway service, so you can leave with your burger to eat nearby.",

Their breakfast burger things (I had sausage, lots of my friends has bacon) were fine. But to be honest whilst eating it I felt it was trying (and failing) to rival the pinnacle of excellence that is the double sausage and egg mcmuffin. Maybe my love of the mcmuffin will help inform you as to whether or not to disregard this review ;)Their lunch burgers are decent, but they won't change your life and I don't find myself craving them as I do many other burger places. Generally this place is fine, but I think they're riding the fancy burger wave. They throw good ingredients in but then the burgers seem to disappoint, possibly because I expect so much after their near poetic descriptions.",

The server asked us how we wanted our burger, and medium rare turned out to be perfectly pink and juicy, and the brioche was heavenly. And while we were waiting, the server heard us talking about BBQ sauce in America, then he came over and brought us a side of homemade BBQ sauce, which was such a kind gesture!

People have a 'this is where it's at and that's why I'm here' look on their faces.I like the look of the place and the staff are friendly, but my burger was so greasy and covered in a slimy mess of, I'm not sure....so it kept slipping outside the bun. It was a bit like eating an ice cream cone on a hot summer's day...you race to finish it before it's melted.The french fries were a little too salty and over-seasoned.Afterwards I sort of had the 'I've just eaten junk food' feeling.Most of my clothes are now in the machine...it splashed all over me.BUT...this won't put me off giving this place another chance because it's so...likeable and I'm beginning to think this is the way people like their hamburgers these days and I'm willing to adapt. I'll also be ready for the splash effect next time.",

The place itself is definately not a place to settle for long as the place is not really big, pretty loud and the seats not really comfortable, but it is a place worth visiting if you want to eat a slobby and tasty burger with some delicious siders. We normally don't have to wait for long to get a table, but I can imagine that this can vary according to when you go there. The menu is simple: 4 burgers & a special burger, some siders, chicken wings and chicken legs, that's it. But it's the simplicity that makes this place so special to me. Each burger is just to the point and makes it really hard to decide what to get. I normally chose the Jose Jose buger and get some fries with chicken roast skin salt mayo. In addition one has to mention the harrissa ketchup sauce on every table which is pure damage. Got myself a 250ml portion to take away to Germany and I use it whereever I can.",

When I found out that you could potentially get your dirty hands on a delightful \"Ari Gold\" or \"Smokey Robinson\", without having to queue, I got straight on it.The Burgers at this joint are wonderful, they have the best toasted brioche bun I've ever laid my hands on, it's toasty, slightly sweet and perfectly in proportion with the filling. The meat is always cooked to order, medium rare means medium rare here. Thank you. The rosemary salt chips were ever so slightly too dry, but you're forgiven. When it comes to the confit wings, I've always been on the fence, The texture and fall of f the bone meat is perfect, but the taste always leave me ever so slightly perplexed. but this is a very personal preference. There are only two downsides to this place, the lack of waiting definitely isn't one. But the ambiance does seem to be lacking, if you've been to the Patty&Bun on St. James' street, this one just doesn't give the same small table cramped hipster eating feel, which I thought I hated, but turns out I love. The second complaint is the depleted menu, it's not like the original menu was extensive but they cut out \"Lambshank Redemption\" - a delicious lamb burger found in the St. James' St branch - not to mention the drinks too.All in all though, considering the quick service, no need to wait, how much closer it is to work. I'm thrilled that Patty&Bun have come to Liverpool St. I just hope non-foodies don't have the good fortune of stumbling across it.",

It's much more a tak-away spot, but even at 10 PM on Friday we just had to wait for 5-10 minutes before getting our table.The menu is the same as the other P&B: 4 burgers + special with some sides, that's it. Couple of sides, chicken wings and chicken legs, That's it.Now, this is going to be an endless war: Is P&B the best burger in town?! Well my opinion NO it's not. Is it a good burger? Yeah it's a pretty good burger.The burger is a mess, which can be a good thing. There is ton of sauce, ton of ingredients. If you like it, you do, I mean you really do, as you'll get your hands dripping with sauce and your mouth full of pleasant and aggressive flavors. Bu then... well.. it lacks in the quality of the patty (it's good, but not that good, and it was not very well cooked), and all sauces together do not allow anything to shine, there is no real highlights that made me appreciate the dish.I think it's something you have to try it, and then decide whether you like it or not. If you are like me, then you won't get in again in less than 6 months time, but otherwise... well lots of people consider it the best burger in London, and you may find out this is what you think about it!",

Juicy and smokey and hits all the spots.Anyways, I've been a slow fan of P&B, my first ever visit to the Marylebone branch was a disappointment but that WAS the year of Burger Summer where I took it upon myself to try ALOT of London Burgers. (RIP my 22 year old metabolism) and it took a few more visits to really love P&B.I'm even inclined to say they cook the burgers here better than Marylebone, it's far juicier and more flavourful. Once you bite into the burger, all the noise just dissipates. That's why this place is a solid 5 stars.",

My experience with the slimmed down version was a little different. \u00a0We phoned our order in advance and the pickup time was really close to when they said so full marks for that. After getting back to the office and getting stuck in I found the bags were well stocked with napkins, trays and condiments and that was a nice touch as we didn't have to ask for anything. \u00a0 Unfortunately the food let everything else down slightly. I found the fries a little dry and overcooked and couldn't really taste anything from the rosemary but the biggest disappointment was the burger. I went for the Smokey Robinson and asked for all of the burgers to be medium. After biting into mine I could see that it was overcooked. There wasn't even a hint of pink to the meat and looking around at how everyone else's burger was made me slightly envious. Hopefully I was just unlucky but it definitely tarnished my experience",

I want to like it, but for the reasons many people love it, I just don't enjoy it. The meat is strong and gamey tasting. The brioche bun is a bit dense and dry. The pile of juicy greasy stuff that pours off makes it messy and a bit stomach turning. The burger wouldn't stay in the bun, the cheese falls off, and the big hunk of uncut lettuce was unwieldy. The tall benches and bar stools aren't comfortable. On the upside, the service was quick, the staff so friendly, and my burger came cooked as requested and without tomato on the ari gold, just like I asked. I know I'm in the minority and that everyone there was in raptures about their food. I threw half of mine away and as I type this, I have that icky feeling you get after a McDonalds.

The fries were crunchy and the rosemary accented them nicely. I need to ding you for the messiness though. I appreciated the wet wipe, but I needed a hand wash station.

This time, I tried the newer location because I knew if there wasn't seating, I could get it to go. (I had to get it to go). I got the Smoky Robinson because everyone says it's the best. I also got a side of chips, but upgraded to the chicken salt and chicken mayo instead of the Rosemary, because last time I had the chips, there was no Rosemary flavor anyway.The burger was fine. It was tasty, but again, like before, it was lacking a little something that I really want in my burger, namely an amazing tasting burger. The toppings and things just kind of took away from it all. And the chips were lack-luster at best. Slightly soggy and I wouldn't have guessed that they were supposed to taste like chicken if I hadn't ordered them. They just were quite bland and boring. I didn't even finish them. Which is disappointing.In all honesty, there are SO many better burger places I would choose to go to, that I definitely won't really be back here (as one of my favorites is quite close by). It's definitely cementing in my mind that the most popular does not necessarily equal the best. Patty and Bun is a popular burger joint in London, but far from the best. Don't just listen to the herd, but do a bit of research on your own and try something else.",

Someone recommended Patty and Bun at the bar. Idk, the guy was a hipster looking fellow, I just assumed he knew what he was talking about in Shoreditch. Well he was right. I walked in, they're playing Skepta on the speakers. Full volume. That track 'Numbers'. Tune and a half. I order 'Ari Gold' (cheese burger). Juicy. Greasy. Flavoursome. Soft buns. F*ck me I'll order another son. Anyway...this became a regular burger place I hit. 9/10 for the taste (all their burgers are decent). Atmosphere was 8.5/10. View?..view of my burger and 1L of beer was decent. 8.5/10. I recommend Patty and Bun to all.",

This branch is a lot smaller compared to the main Marylebone one but a fraction of the waiting time. It gets busy during lunch hours with all the city workers but they have a quick take away window just like in a lot of New York munchies. It's full of messy goodness and I usually go for the Ari gold which just oozes with melted cheese and caramelised onions on top of the juicy beef. (It really gets messy so I wouldn't recommend eating it outside!) And now the bbq chicken wings are hard to miss...it just falls off the bone! I definitely want to try the crispy chicken burger next time which just spills out from the bun with lots of garlic aioli!",

I opened my takeaway order to find that the juices were running, and braced myself to find the buns mushy. However, the brioche held up as I devoured the burger. The Smoky Robinson is the way to go if you love smoked anything. It is served with smoked mayo on bacon and caramelized onion, which basically means that it will hit that bacon craving a thousand times over and leave you salivating. I was also impressed that the relatively small burger (coming from the states) kept me full for a long time, which I believe speaks to the quality of the burger. There will be a queue, but do not be intimidated as it moves quickly.",

The service was friendly and we were somehow able to snag one of the two-top tables at 12:30pm on a Saturday but the food just let me down.I ordered the Ari Gold minus the mayo because mayo is gross and it was delivered to our table within an acceptable amount of time, perhaps 10 minutes from ordering. It was cooked well, possibly a little overcooked for having ordered it cooked medium though. I unwrapped it and juices were flowing which was a delightful sign but that's sort of where the delightfulness ended.I found the burger to be tasteless but found the cheese to be very flavorful which was strange. I don't think I've ever consumed a cheeseburger and actually tasted the cheese. Anyway, the bun was soggy due to soaking up a lot of the juice (grease?) and therefore started to fall apart after a couple of bites. The biggest downfall to my burger was that it was room-temperature-borderline-cold.Would possibly give P&B another go in the future but would likely give other burger joints a go first.",

I love their coleslaw too.Portobello mushroom burger is fantastic for vegetarians. Some amazing sides are on the menu too. Tamarind Thighs are something you'd wanna try. But remember, if you thought sides were small, you are wrong. Tamarind thighs actually deserve a place among the mains but is probably only on the sides menu because it is not a burger. One portion of Tamarind Thighs comes with three yummy chicken thighs. Only order this in addition to your burger if you are really hungry or if you have someone to share it with else you won't be able to finish it. Very sumptuous indeed.Trust me you'll love it anyway. Will update this review later. I'm too hungry nowSo to give you an update on what I had the other day, I was slightly disappointed at the amount of oil that was oozing out of the burger. I felt they could do a little more to drain it out first before putting the patty between the buns. Apart from that everything else was good. Enjoyed the Tamarind thighs too.",

I went at lunchtime (around 12:30pm/1:00pm) on a week day.I ordered the Ari Gold cheeseburger which was very tasty, it was so juicy and very yummy indeed. Next up, my brother and I shared the Thunder Thighs with Tamarind glaze, it was a delicious sweet sauce but surprisingly spicy, so this blew me away a bit! It was all yummy but obviously annoying that no fries came with the burger, despite paying the \u00a37.50 for no table reservation and no table services (you have to go up and order...)It would be so so great if you could book a table, and to have the ease of a waiter or waitress coming to your table. It was my brother's birthday and it would have made the experience so much more enjoyable. I wouldn't have dared going for dinner, I can imagine the queues and waiting time being a joke at dinner hours...I do recommend, but only if you don't mind the stress of waiting for a while and eagerly keeping your eye out for a table...",

He did have to alter his choice from the Smoky Robinson which although they were happy to remove the bacon due to his religious reasons they did mention that the caramelised onions were cooked with pork therefore be weary and ask if you have any special dietary requirements. \u00a0The establishment is quite small, enough to cater to 10-15 people however due to the location in Liverpool Street you can see how it is ideal for the busy takeaway lunch. Now onto my food, and my god the food is unbelievable! It's messy, it's fun, it's quite simply delicious!! The chips were served with a special roast chicken mayo which was nice but the best bit was quite simply the burger. I went for the lamb shank redemption (GREAT NAME, GREAT FILM) and the lamb was really nice as was the gherkins in the burger. \u00a0I would highly recommend it for any burger lover out there with the total cost of the meal with the drink coming in under \u00a313.",
