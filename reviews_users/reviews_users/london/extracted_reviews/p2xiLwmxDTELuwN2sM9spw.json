I felt at home amongst others who I presume had also finished the previous night's festivities early.Big boy English breakfasts are on offer and \u00a0really this is what the place is all about..The atmosphere isn't really about chilling and reading the papers but rather having hair of the dog and laughing about the previous nights exploits with your mates.",

They have have several levels here with Fine Dining on the top floor, more informal dining and private rooms on 2nd and 3rd floors and a lively bar on street level. The bar is great to meet people if you are planning to go on to Fabric (just next door). The top floor is where I recently took \"her indoors\" for her birthday. Steak and meat specialisation as you can imagine located just across the road from Smithfields market. She had the steak and I had steak and kidney Pudding. Very pleased with both main courses although be aware that the steaks take 40 minutes. Apparently they let it stand for that length of time to improve the flavour. It did the trick as it was the best steak she had ever eaten. The service felt a little lax though as they failed to mention this at time of ordering. I would highly recommend this joint for either party fun with a group or just the 2 of you. Pricey but worth it.",

    "text": "I was just thinking about where I'm going to get a hamburger in this newfound city home of mine, and recalled a meal I had at Smiths that deserves a review. Actually, 2. Actually 3. 1) A company dinner on the top floor. It was cripplingly expensive and I didn't pay, but it was so damn good that my piggy bank is earmarked. One word: STEAK. yeah, the dauphinoise potatoes were unbelievably good, my squid starter was melt-in-the-mouth, and no-one could work out how the dessert was humanly possible it was that amazing...... but the hunk of sirloin on my plate was still the star. It was around \u00a330 which, I'm learning here in good old Chicago, a steaklovers' bankrupcy-in-waiting, is actually very reasonable. Ace view too.2) Company Christmas do. It was better Christmas fare than you usually get but really, I can't citicise a single thing because in my drunken state, and at the goading of others, I asked the waitress at one stage to retrieve a small green plastic parachute man from the dustbin whence he had been inadvertently thrown. She actually did it. Another agreed to have black face paint applied to her face by a far-from-sober colleague. \u00a0We love the staff. And the Christmas dinner had bread sauce - spot on. 3) A faraway (5 years+) meal on the first floor which was more affordable. There was nothing that made me question the laws of physics (as per top floor souffle), but the gnocchi I had for a starter began a two year relationship so they got something right. It was a disastrous relationship but i'm not even gonna knock a star off! That's how good it is here.",

We had a few drinks in the ground level bar & found the drinks great & the staff friendly. The dining hall upstairs was also very nice. As a vegetarian though- I wish they added a few more veggie options. Their only veggie main course is a pumpkin cannelloni. They also offer 1 veggie starter which is also a pasta & sometimes a veg soup of the day. They should offer another non-pasta vegetarian starter as no one wants to have pasta and then pasta again! I was lucky to come here on a night where they had a veggie soup- which was white bean & very good. I got the pumpkin cannelloni which was very nice as well. The service was also prompt. This is a great place to come with a group as they know how to handle big parties. I would come here again. I don't usually notice music where I go but they had an amazing playlist that alternated all night which made a great atmosphere.",

    "text": "I have rarely been more disappointed than after tonight's dinner at Smith's - I hadn't been for a while but I'd always had pretty great food there - and so I was really looking forward to dinner with an American friend I hadn't seen for years. At least I had fun catching up with my friend - the meal was, perhaps, the worst I've ever had in a London restaurant. Having had a delicious pumpkin ravioli at the Malmaison a couple weeks ago, I was really excited to see it on the Smiths menu - with broad beans and parsley, which sounded nice and seasonal. It arrived suspiciously quickly after we ordered - and I must say it didn't look very attractive, two rather lumpy parcels on a plate swimming in parsley butter, with no sight of those broad beans. It was one of the most bizzare things I've ever eaten. And yes, I did eat it all (I've been brought up not to waste food, and I was pretty hungry). But I really wish I hadn't bothered. It tasted like raw pasta dough, with a completely flavour-free filling which managed to be mushy, rubbery and slightly gummy all at the same time. Not pleasant, at all. There were 2 or 3 broad beans lurking within, which were the high point. I will gloss over the rather tasteless comment the waiter made about my friend trying to finish her side order of chips...because I think he thought he was making a joke. But when we came to order dessert, I asked if I could have the sticky toffee pudding with some extra toffee sauce instead of the icecream. Believe me, I always ask for it like this, because I don't like ice cream and puddings can be a bit dry without some kind of extra sauce. I've never had a negative reaction, anywhere. Until now, when I got told the desserts were all portioned out, and they were \u00a0not allowed to give me any extra sauce because there wouldn't be enough for some other customer later on. SOS is not a cheap place. It's not like they couldn't find a bit of butter, sugar and cream in the kitchen to make a bit more, should they need it. Anyway eventually I managed to get a bit of extra sauce, and gthe pudding was fine, but to be honest I will never, ever go back to Smith's again.",

Of course, I got a side of chips and those were perfectly fried.Good atmosphere and fun location across from the meat market.

Apart from a minute steak and sausage and mash, there wasn't really much in the way of meat. Not even a 'tasty burger', to inaccurately quote Mr L Jackson.The food was okay, nothing really to complain about, but nothing to shout about either. My sandwich was no better than the sandwich shop around the corner, and the english breakfasts were no better than your local cafe.

But alas this isn't a television review, it's a restaurant review, and after expecting great things I was left somewhat disappointed by my experience here. The food was.. Well some of it was delicious, as the ingredients are definitely good quality and fresh, as evidenced by my mozzarella and beetroot salad for starter, and the rhubarb and custard creme brulee was a-mazing, but my main course of steak was slightly lacklustre, not cooked to my liking and served with luke-warm, flaccid chips and a pathetic salad consisting of two lettuce leaves and half a tomato. The service was pretty brusque and, it being a friday night, the downstairs bar was full of city types whose braying chatter filled the upstairs dining room making it difficult to have a relaxed conversation. There are definite good points about Smiths, but for the same price there are a number of much better restaurants within a 5 minute walk, such as comptoir gascon, st john food and wine or the modern pantry.",

Since the time of Henry I in 1123 until 1855 the Bartholomew's Fair was held here on Bartholomew Tide (24 August). It was originally a cloth fair, in the 16 century it became a pleasure fair that lasted 2 weeks. The area was also the main horse and cattle market from 1150 until 1855. The show continues to this day in Earls Court as the Smithfield Show. The expression bull in a china shop stems from the habit that drovers had of stampeding their herds to the market. In 1851 the current market buildings where erected, it included an underground railway station, that was linked to the main London railway stations, for the transportation of livestock. In the 12 century and for the next 400 years, it also was the chief execution ground. In the 15 century this became the execution ground for heretics, they of course were burnt. Among some of the victims were William Wallace (as in Brave heart) and Roger Mortimer, who murdered Edward II. In 1381 Wat Tyler was stabbed here by Sir William Walworth, the mayor, in front of Richard II. Walworth was later executed in the nearby hospital.",

You can see the kitchen as well which is also a good thing. it gives you something to watch when you're feeling a bit worse for wear, and anywhere that will let you see the food being cooked is clearly proud of what they do. As brunch was nearly turning into lunch, we got to eat steak for breakfast! :-) My minute steak, eggs and chips was perfect. The two (yay) eggs were perfect and runny and everything was yum. I think it was about \u00a38 but I'm really not sure. Most stuff was about \u00a38 which is expensive for brunch, but it's Smiths. You know their meat is the best it can be. I could have eaten more eggs, and I was so tempted to order another banana milkshake, but as yummy as they were, one really in enough. We spent another half an hour chatting (in mono syllables admittedly) and reading the paper. They didn't mind one bit that we were talking up a table (benches, so hopefully you don't mind sharing your table). The staff were very friendly actually. I love Smiths. I'd eat here all the time if I lived in the area. I'm holding off from giving it my 5th star until I've tried the other areas - the club, cocktail bar, wine room, posh terrace restaurant and surely I can convince the Qype meat up to come here next time? Maybe by then they'll put EB on the menu. Whoever heard of a brunch menu without Eggs Benidict? madness",

My Club sandwich had tiny pieces of chicken, i could hardly see them. Our table was DIRTY. It seemed like it had been washed of with a floor rag. Yuck, I didn't even dare to put my phone on it. Utensils were dirty, and the ketchup bottle looked like someone had snorted snot on it. This is just not the way to go about, this place should get a better manager and staff who understand that food and dirt do not go together!The waffle was still great, but the rest of the experience sucked.",

    "text": "Any regular viewers of masterchef will recognise John Torode as the shouty Australian judge with a habit of articulating every vowel he speaks as slowly as possible. He is also however, the owner of Smith's of Smithfield (or SOS as they insist on branding everything). Smith's occupies five floors of a beautiful old building opposite the famous meat-market. If you're planning a visit you can apply the basic rule that the higher the floor you dine in, the more money you will pay for your food. This then explains why I've only ever been to the ground floor! Smith's is at its busiest during weekend brunch so expect to wait for at least twenty minutes if you arrive during these hours. Don't let this put you off though as there is an impressively stocked bar at the back of the room in which you are invited to wait for your table. Bloody Mary's and fruit smoothies seemed to be in endless supply here for the hangover crowd. The food here is good but not great- worth a visit if you're in the area but don't go out of your way to get there. Breakfast's are very popular and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his even though a few items were a bit burnt. My pork sandwich with apple sauce and stuffing on the other hand was perfectly cooked but I had expected a little side salad or a few chips to justify its \u00a35.40 price tag. Regardless of these small issues we still had a good time at Smith's. The room has a great atmosphere and between its breakfasts, sofa's, Bloody Mary's and smoothie's it is as though Torode himself is telling you to relax and enjoy your weekend hangover.",

    "text": "Good service, decent food, great atmosphereI went to Smiths for Sunday brunch and was entertained by the menu choice of salmon fishcakes, a change from my usual selection of blueberry pancakes or french toast. The fish cakes were huge although a bit bland in flavour with too high a potato to salmon content. The hollandaise sauce served with it was creamy with a hint of acidity. I think the poached egg on top was a bit random and would have preferred some chips instead. The coffee is adequate and served at the right temperature to enhance the flavour and my friend adored the cappuccinos. The atmosphere is very lively, and it is highly entertaining to walk through the drunk people staggering out of fabric on your way in. I think this is a place that's good for a few people as tables are in high demand and definitely not with a hangover. Too loud and too busy when your head is pounding but great for when you want a more upbeat start to your day.",

    "text": "After a concert in Barbican Centre on a Friday you are a little bit out of the way for restaurants in the Barbican Area. We were a group of 6 people and decided to walk towards Farringdon not far off. Have lived in that area, I used to visit their famous meat market placed just opposite Smiths of Smithfield. What better business idea to open a very meaty restaurant, where you get the steak you not can buy in a supermarket. Generally as a rule, I try not to buy meat, as I always have been disappointed. It was no surprise when all of us stuck to the same main course: steak and fries! Can you imagine a table full of steaks? Heaven! And I was not disappointed, asked for medium rare and got what I wanted. I suggest you order a salad as a side - you do not want to look like someone who did not have vegetables for years! Why does that not come with the steak?We were seated in the second floor which is known for its good wine selection. The tables are out of dark wood and round. The big room is a mix between a pub and steak house. I would recommend making a booking.What I realised later is that there are several floors. The coffee, lounge on the ground floor, which has the newspapers of the day and offers sandwiches might be good to visit when making a trip to the market.",

I'm inclined to think this because of the celebrity chef (John Torode) connection.Having eaten here on a few occasions I would say that it is ok but certainly not the best food I've eaten.I ordered one of the large, all day breakfasts on my last visit. Again, the food was perfectly acceptable but I've had better in the local greasy spoon. Whilst I like baked beans, I'd prefer it if they weren't dumped over everything else on the plate. Similarly the fried egg was nothing special; thin grissly white that had spent a little too long in the frying pan.Ok in general, but for the price I would want something a bit better.",

No, diversity isn't an old old wooden ship, but it does get represented here by no less than 4 separate restaurants (if you include the ground floor bar)! FOUR! You could spend all day in here and have 3 different meals in 3 different settings. Four if you want a greedy supper as well? Why not eh?Ground floor is an ideal city boozer which serves decent pub fare and the drinks are solid. This is where i've been most often (don't judge) but have also experienced a couple of meals up in the Dining Room which I enjoyed greatly.And it's unique right? If feels different, it looks different.... it's just err... different. (unless you go to NYC often.... oops).Buy me a beer when you see me in there. NO? Ok, a cider then. Thanks.",

I would recommend as a place to hit after work with a collection of colleagues (to the extent that you want to mix it up from the local pub or Corney & Barrow) but I'd be unlikely to take a date or a couple of buddies here, instead preferring a spot with a bit more character and less noise.",

    "text": "Perhaps I had been living under a rock, but I hadn't really heard of this place before I was taken there by a friend who'd booked a few of us in for a Saturday brunch. Well, I had only lived in London for a little over a year at that point, so I guess that's forgiven. Either way, let us just say that I went in with minimal expectations of the place and therefore was easily impressed by the warehouse-y decor of the place. Even after having booked our table well in advance, we had to wait for a few mins before we were seated at the lounge cafe/bar on the ground floor. Those few minutes at the door gave me a preview of the clientele the place serves - part grunge, part cool, part hungover, SoS seemed to be where the City crowd rubbed shoulders over the weekend, the place was positively teeming with people who seemed like bankers, lawyers and consultants.Located in Clerkenwell across the meat market and a few steps away from Fabric, this place is where the trendy party-goers stumble into after a big night out and cure their hangovers with Bloody Marys and such. The decibel level of the music certainly seemed to indicate so - not that we minded, but I do imagine many would object to club music so early in the day. Most of us went for the All-Day Breakfast options and were not disappointed - the British classics such as sausages, black pudding, bacon, eggs, shrooms and such arrived in generous portions, standard fare really. My Parisian friend positively cringed at the thought of so much grease so early in the day and opted for the Greek Salad, which seemed underwhelming at best. Her Blackberry, Mint & Yoghurt smoothie looked delish but at 4.50quid, you would hope for it to be so.All in all, it was a pleasant experience but a bit tinged with some level of pretentiousness out of proportion with their not inexpensive brunch offerings. It is only later that I realised that SoS is THE steak place in this part of the City and, therefore, carries a great deal of snob factor. I must go check it out sometime and judge for myself.",

Why is this a secret? because it's one of my mate's FAVOURITE places in Clerkenwell and I'd hate to tell her that ALL the times we came here for a pint, I was simply not impressed.It just seems quite overrated, or maybe that's the ambience from FABRIC seeping over from a few doors down. Either way, business suits usually make their way here after work and stay until about 9. The music from the 'DJ' is reallllly loud, making it a place not easy to hear someone from 12 inches away (yeah, whatever that is in cm...it's darn hard to hear!). The drinks are typical pub drinks...mixers and pints...and there used to be the CREEPIEST painting of about 30 children straight from Children of the Corn hanging on one wall. Uh, Really? Kids scare me enough with their GERMS and BACTERIA and odd smells, do we REALLY need a painting of posessed kids in a bar?So...if you're going for a pint in Islington, find a historic pub that's a little less pretentious and a little more authentic...unless you like that sort of thing or, like me, end up braving the creepy painting for the sake of friendship.",

    "text": "SOS, as people who can't be bothered typing out Smith of Smithfield out call it, is something to do with John Torode (him with the bulging eyes from Masterchef). And so, because he's been such an unswerving, nitpicking critic on our televisions, should I give him the same treatment? Of course I should. Because I'm not the sort of person to read up on somewhere before I go (why would I? I wouldn't want stupid things like that to cloud my judgement), I don't know much about the place. There's a ground floor which seemed pretty decent, mainly filled with people drinking while wearing suits and listening to the in-house PA playing Pixies, Roxy Music and The Cure, which is piped to the floor above it. We've come a long way where you can eat in a restaurant and listen to The Pixies. Whether that's a good or bad thing, you decide. Anyway, on the first floor (I believe there's another floor, but I didn't get invited to eat there, so I won't pass judgement on it), there's a nice space which is dimly lit enough so you don't feel like you're sat on everyone's knee in the room. Which I approve of. However, the food wasn't particularly mindblowing. For my starter, I had a smoked mackerel terrine, which was pleasant enough but really could've done with some seasoning (a muttered complaint that everyone around our table seemed to have). For main, I chewed a dryish pheasant which again, was passable, but I really expected a little more. The portion sizes were decent enough, but everything seemed to lack a quality that you may expect with a famous chef at the helm. Shame really. The prices seemed reasonably cheap for London, so I guess I shouldn't grumble... but really, I felt that I could've got the dishes pretty much anywhere else, leaving me with a vague feeling of 'meh'. Would I go again? I guess so... but I wouldn't suggest it as the first port of call. If you get invited there, you won't have a rotten time, nor a great one. One thing I will say though is that the staff were really great and efficient and should have a pat on the back. Otherwise, there's not much of note about the place, apart from its celebrity owner.",

We arrived around 5:30 pm and our table was ready for us as soon as we entered. The room was relatively empty at first but by 6:00 pm the floor was packed with people to form an exciting setting for the dinner soon to follow.We were greeted with a very polite waiter who gave us plenty of time to order our food, all the while attending to our every need which included a few glasses of wine, 2 bottles of still water, and deliciously fresh bread. The service was great but the food was even better. We ordered a crab risotto to start, a porterhouse steak with a side of fries for me, and a plate of halibut with lobster sauce for the lady. The risotto, though small, was delicious, the fish was just as good but the steak stole the show. When ordering, smiths gives you a choice of 8 different sauces you'd like with your steak and I chose the bone marrow butter. The steak was a perfect medium rare and tasted great by itself but the bone marrow made it the best steak I've ever had. The fries were a perfect compliment indeed.When in London, definitely go to Smiths of Smithfield. You WON'T regret it!",

I had heard that when this place first opened it was absolutely heaving and you would wait months to get a table even in the 1st floor wine bar so I was expecting spectacular energy levels and uber-cool hipsters. But sadly, on a Saturday night, the 2nd floor was nowhere near full and the 1st floor was completely shut--chairs-on-tables shut. The space is nicely decorated and is probably intended to make you feel comfortable and relaxed yet sophisticated and cool at the same time. I had the special, seared yellow snapper. The fish was tasty, but the cut was very difficult to eat as it was massively thick and a lot of the structure of the fish was still intact. When you order seared fish, you expect to receive a knife as sharp as a steak-knife. My b/f had the chicken which frankly we could have cooked ourselves at home and my friend had the lamb--I think she made the right choice, although I can't confirm for sure as I didn't taste it. The dessert was particularly good. We shared the cr\u00e8me brule and the peach and champagne sorbet. Both were simple yet delicious.",

Go for special occasions. Go if you like good crab, good steak and well-mixed cocktails. The bar is stunning, the view over Clerkenwell is about as good as you can find, and it's like a little classy oasis of calm, poised dining.The upstairs restaurant is slightly less pricy, but still very much worth a pop. The menu is short, and varies regularly depending on what they've snaffled off the market. It's darker, busier and normally packed with well-dressed boys and girls on dates.The ground floor is a loud, brutalist, grey, clubby bar. Even at brunch time. It's full of families who look like they've fallen out of a Habitat catalogue, post-club hipsters, the odd tourist and a few scared looking gourmands.Overall the food is *good* but not biblical. It's simple, well-presented and tasty. The difference between pre-telly era SoS and post, is the less-than-subtle pimping of John's book, and the constant bustle.If you've been out at Fabric all night then this is the best place to get some comedown-combat breakfast.",

    "text": "Friday night in the dining room. Went down the stairs to use the restroom, as I came back up I could hear the music on the ground floor. \"iccccee iccccee baby.........\" I love when buildings can hold multiple environments in the same space. Ground floor bar was all clubby and packed to the gills. Next levels a wine room. And then our lovely dining room. Most of the food was excellent. The oysters made me think of home and many a summer nights at the beach. I absolutely didn't enjoy my french onion soup. Really really too sweet for me and meh.It's tasty but don't eat the bread if you're planning on ordering a starter and dessert along with your main. Must have desserts. Creme Brulee (bitch is huge!) and the sticky toffee pudding. Maybe just not at the same time when you've had a bunch of food already despite sharing everything with the rest of the table.I was uncomfortably full the rest of the night but it was so worth it.",

    "text": "One of my faves in London! This place pretty much has it all, 4 floors including a large open space bar and different dining options ranging from a wine bar, casual to fine dining on the upper floors with amazing steaks which is hard to find in London. 1st floor: Large, roomy and casual seating where they serve Brunch, Lunch and then an awesome Bar hangout in the evenings. I heard a lot of great things about the Brunch, but have only been here in the evenings for the bar and dinner. There are lots of seating options from leather chairs, small tables, benches that accommodate any party size. Perfect place to meet up for drinks with friends or business clients. I like that it's big enough where you don't feel like a canned sardine and it's not so noisy that you can actually have a conversation with your mates. Upper Floors: Mmmmm...MEAT! *drool* Smithfield's owns and operates a huge wholesale meat market located across the street and boy do these guys know their meat! Depending what your mood is, there is casual style dining on one floor and a rooftop dining area if you want to go all out. Both have incredible menus featuring their amazing cuts of meat. Bookings are suggested for the dining areas, so I usually put my name in when we get to the bar for a later time. But if really want to get a table, you should call ahead. You would not want to miss out on the awesome food here! Love SOS...just writing this review makes me want to head over there right now",

Asked for a beer that we'd been drinking in the bar downstairs and was told I'd need to go down there and get it myself, or else only the bottled beer on the menu was available. Surly waiting staff who seemed to forget a lot and we ended up being served by 3 different people (though that may partly have been because they had nothing else to do). It meant being asked several times about the same things and still the service was slow. Burger and chips was just shy of \u00a320, but still a little dry, and for that kind of money I'd expect a few more chips. Generally pretty unimpressive and frankly a bit up itself. I'd expected better, and I won't be going back, there are plenty of better alternatives close by.",

The top floor is the monty, if you have to ask how much, then you cannot afford the food, the second floor is more reasonably priced, you also have a vip section as well.I have only eaten on the ground floor!. The ground floor is large, old styled warehouse/ rustic look, its very trendy, the food is of absolute FIRST CLASS, but you pay for it!. The breakfast is top quality, very tasty, pies, sausages, eggs, bacon.. etc are of top quality, very well made and the service is very good, it can be a bit noisy inside due to the numbers of customers (which is a good sign!) and the large floor to ceiling size. IMO the food on the ground floor cannot be bettered anywhere, but you do pay a premium for it.... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

    "text": "Cheating on Glasgow for a moment to Yelp about my little London holiday last weekend...Smiths of Smithfield was the kick-off meal to our girly London weekend. \u00a0My friend and I met up with one of her friends here for dinner on the first night of our holiday. \u00a0We skipped the starters, trusting that because this is a meaty place known for very meaty meals, the mains could take us through the dining experience on their own. \u00a0A little aside: as I had never heard of SoS before, my friend actually described it to me as, \"a place with lots of meat.\" \u00a0That is all I knew going into this restaurant experience...First, about the atmosphere; SoS is enormous, but I like how the whole establishment is compartmentalized. \u00a0When we first walked through the door, I heard lots of loud music and it was very dark and I thought, \"oh, no! \u00a0We're going to be shouting at each other in pitch blackness the whole night!\"...but then we were led upstairs to the very civilized second floor dining room (jeez, how old am I now?!), where we were offered a lovely table by the landing. \u00a0We could converse easily throughout the meal, yet it was still a bustling dining area. \u00a0For old farts like us (in our early 30s!) and people actually wanting to talk to each other, they really hit it right with the second floor.Back to the meal... \u00a0As it turned out, the mains were enough to hold us over AND deter us from the idea of pudding. \u00a0Perhaps it's because we snacked so much on the train ride down (curse you, pick'n mix!), because I am a pudding fiend and I can almost always find room for that kind of thing! \u00a0I ordered the Indonesian fish curry and my friends had the pork belly with mashed potato. \u00a0My curry was amazing: a lovely variety of seafood in a satisfying sauce with noodles and sprouts. \u00a0I also sneaked a bite or two of my friend's pork belly and that was fabulous, as well. \u00a0Whatever was in the sauce on top of the pork, it was to die for.All in all it was a very good dining experience. \u00a0I couldn't see myself becoming a regular because of a) the price and b) the size of restaurant is a bit big for my normal comfort level, but to kick off a fun London holiday, it was just what we needed.",

    "text": "Quick glance+ cheap and cheery downstairs, or...+ more upmarket upstairs+ fresh ingredients- booking recommended for \"upper levels\" The restaurant is run by John Torode, who co-hosts the popular cooking competition programme Masterchef on BBC UK. The establishment essentially has \"several\" restaurants. Ground floor has a pub/caf\u00e9 feel, where you can order sandwiches or bangers & mash. Prices are reasonable, the atmosphere buzz with chatters, and it's great place to catch up with friends. As you ascend the building, so too do the prices. On the first floor are a wine room and a private room. On the 2nd floor is the \"Dining Room,\" where I had lunch with my colleagues on a weekday. The \"Dining Room\" feels more like a gastro pub. There are a lot of tables on this floor, but you are far enough away from other parties to have your own space. Prices are comparable to London restaurants, with mains at \u00a314-16 per plate. We didn't book and managed to get a table for a busy lunch seating, but booking is advisable to ensure no wait. I had the roast cod on this occasion, and it was succulent, perfectly cooked, and well presented. The waiter was very switched on and ensured we had a good dining experience. On the top floor is the rooftop restaurant, and prices for mains range from \u00a320-30 per person. I have never been, but I would imagine this is the place to go if you want to take your business client for lunch or treat your hot date. The \"tiered\" restaurant is a clever concept, appealing to a wide range of diners for different occasions. From what I had for lunch at the \"Dining Room,\" the ingredients were fresh, cooking quality was good, and waiting staff friendly. I look forward to going back and trying a different \"level.\"",

The service was impeccable and staff were friendly and helpful without being snobby or intimidating. Smith's of Smithfield prides itself as being an establishment that's been around for a 1000 years since the site was still an actual meat market and so of course I went for the fillet steak as my main course \u00a0do it, it will change your life :)The Dorset Rock oysters I had as my starter were absolutely divine and I highly recommend the Peach Souffle or Custard Tart for dessert.The atmosphere was buzzing yet relaxed and even though we arrived just after 7.30 we felt comfortable enough to all remain chatting at the table until almost midnight.",

The staff were also very friendly and attentive.The second time I went we ate on the top floor - the food was definitely a step up from before (and that's saying something as I was impressed by the middle floor!) Although I am quite glad I wasn't paying! The meat was definitely the star of the show - the terrine I had for a starter was full of flavour, and the steak for a main was perfectly cooked. The ony thing I wasn't a fan of was the butter, which had carraway seeds in it (which I hate). That was just my personal taste though, as the rest of my party loved it. At the end of the evening, one of the waiting staff knocked over a glass - it was only water, and hardly spilled on anyone. However, the waiter insisted on getting us free drinks, which I thought was really nice. We were also presented with a couple of copies of John Torode's signed book at the end of the meal, which again I was impressed with (even though we must have spent a fortune by this point!)I loved the atmosphere in the restaurant, especially as I was there around Christmas both times and so they put an impressive Christmas tree up that extends up multiple floors in the central stairwell. The only downside to the building is that the acoustics are not brilliant - this was especially noticeable on the third floor when it was sometimes difficult to have a conversation without rasing voices.",

We were looked at very suspiciously by the rather unhelpful doorman. Found it in the end though *phew*Us 5 ladies reserved our table on a deal through book a table - \u00a317 for two courses and a glass of bubbles each (on a Friday too - pretty good!). Told them this as we arrived but they gave us the normal menus. When the bubbles didn't arrive we again reminded them that we booked on this deal so we were given a much smaller menu and, finally, our bubbles. Very limited choice on that teeny menu: three starters: soup (yawn), a Thai beef salad or a beetroot salad (ick - beetroot!) ...guess what I had? The Thai salad thingy was nice. They should probably mention that the beef is cold. But maybe I'm just never expectant of cold beef. Can't remember what all the choices on the mains were. I know there was steak (for a supplemented fee - cheeky!) or burger. Hello burger! It was bloody massive. The beefy part itself must have been touching an inch and a half thick. Gherkin, chips, the works. Ticked all boxes. Service was hit and miss and the toilets are in the BASEMENT. There is a lift. But when you're on the second floor, it's a lot to ask just to pop to the loo in between courses. Won't be back in a hurry.",

I ignored the big names (Corona, really?), tried the two smaller names, the BOB 'Best of Britain' that definitely wasn't and Zatec that at least met my low expectations. How about having some beers with character? There are only a couple thousand options these days. Food was nothing great. Lamb steak with Eggplant and a spicy sauce was cooked properly, decently tasty, if a bit tough. Not great, but not objectionable. Pumpkin gnocchi was similar. Service was attentive and quick, building is definitely interesting. Finally, the price. 43 quid for one person, only two drinks, definitely not good value given the meal.",

Coffee was ok but not great - not particularly strong and flavoursome. So will check out other places nearby rather than try this again. So a 2 star is a little harsh and I would give it a 2&1/2 if I could but a 3 would be generous.",

Of both literal -and- figurative varieties.SOS probably isn't a place I'd spend a lot of time on the regular, but I was famished, it was open on a Sunday afternoon, and they had an irresistible bacon cheeseburger with chips on offer that I couldn't refuse.The ground floor is a giant open space that one might expect to find in a club. The first floor is another matter - the d\u00e9cor is kicked up a notch, involving lots of wood. A long bar extends the length of the room, and this evening there was a massive table in the back already set up with a set menu for a group of likely 20-30 people.And that burger? Thoroughly massive and satisfying, although the interpretation of 'medium' done apparently errs more toward the 'well' end of the spectrum. No matter, the chips (with a healthy variety of mustard, mayo, and ketchup) made up for it.I'd shy away from the chocolate cake if you're not a huge fudge fan - it was effectively like eating a giant slab of chocolate atop a square of fudge. Heavy and decadent beyond reason. Plus, the Chantilly cream turned out to be a scoop of ice cream, instead. I probably should have opted for the apple and almond tart instead.SOS doesn't tick all my boxes, but on the whole, I'd be willing to come back if someone suggested it. I -am- grateful to have a legit, acceptably-priced (\u00a313.50) burger in the area, though.",

I had the Shoreditch Sling which went down in several delicious thick, cool, long sips. Staff were very friendly and cheery. \u00a0Drinks are served with fresh popcorn which is a nice twist from the usual bar treats.Haven't tried the food yet, but I think I'll save that for the SOS that appears to be opening soon in Spitalfields.",

Despite the largeness and emptiness of the place, all the diners were sat closely to each other - making us look like little human clusters (especially if you see it from a bird's eye view). Interior was decent, and the place was clean but it had that slightly \"ghetto\" feeling to it. I ordered smoked haddock with poached egg, spinach and hollandaise sauce with onion rings as the side. Presentation was OK but could be better on consistency (my friend who ordered the same dish had hers more nicely presented than mine) . The poached egg was nicely done but although smoked haddock was OK at the first few bites, it started to get really salty towards the end, and the spinach was a chore to go through as the texture started to get more soggy. Even though I always finish my food like the good girl that I am, I couldn't go through with this dish.Turned out I wasn't the only one having problems with my dinner. My friend who ordered the lamb asked for medium rare but got a lamb that was medium to well done instead. It was really tough for him to bite so he asked the waitress to change, who happily done it for him. When the lamb replacement came, instead of a medium rare, the lamb turned out to be a rare. It was weird to have them serve the same dish for the third time, so my friend scavenged what he felt was edible of the meat, and just left aside the rest. A real disappointment tbh. Another friend who ordered the lamb had hers medium rare just fine, but she felt that it was quite tasteless and had to eat it with ketchup and mayonnaise. So overall, although food was below par, the service was good - the servers were pleasant throughout and efficient with our requests but as I've mentioned earlier, the food should be more consistent and a more scrutiny should be done on the quality.",

It's a cool venue with 5 levels. Service: Our overall experience was one of trying to be served. We had to ask for drinks every time we needed one, and we had to ask them to take the orders for every course other than dessert (we weren't in a hurry, this was over 2.5 hours). There seemed to be plenty of staff. Drinks: Beer selection was OK, but no draught beer available at the 2nd floor restaurant. Didn't try the wine list. Food: Starters were tasty, mozzarella wrapped in ham and then fried was salty and melting. However, the main event opposite Smithfield market should be the steak. Sadly my rib-eye came out medium instead of medium-rare. It was great quality meat so it wasn't too big a deal, but I think a steakhouse should have steak cooking nailed. It could have done with more char too. The sides / sauce for me were disappointing, chips were only OK. Overall, I blame Goodman for my slightly average review of Smiths. Knowing how good Goodman is, I'd rather pay the extra 15-20% and have draught beer, better cooked steak with more cuts available and completely attentive service, along with generous portions of interesting sides.",

My Smiths All Day Big Breakfast, No. 2 was hearty and delicious. I also liked the open feeling of the ground floor space. It felt casual and fun at the same time. My only minor complaint was that the music was turned up a bit too loud for 7 a.m. on a Monday: it was a bit hard to hear my companion.It's a solid three stars, with a possible fourth after another visit.

The top floor has a completely different vibe than that of the lower floors (i.e. feels much stuffier, but the view is better) and significantly fewer people were eating up there. It was a beautiful sunny day, we definitely lucked out. \u00a0I started with the Tempura Courgette Flower. Oh my gosh, it was so so so good!!!!!!! I loved the warm melted goat cheese. It went so well with the sauce and yum! I normally don't like tempura but they did a great job of making a thin light tempura batter that perfectly complemented the goat cheese. My friend and I then split the Limousin Sirloin and Cornish Lamb Rack. It was way too much food for us to finish, but good. The lamb was a little too fatty for me, but I loved the tomatoes and flavoring. The sirloin was hearty and cooked perfectly. We also had some of the side salads, which was the perfect complement to all that meat. For dessert, I ordered the Baked Alaska. I'd been meaning to try one since watching The Great British Bake Off. In the show, there are different flavors of ice cream, a checkered pattern, and it looks quite complex. The one I received was vanilla ice cream covered in lemon meringue with a biscuit on the bottom. It was still good, but much less exciting (it tasted exactly the way it sounds) and the ice cream wasn't melted enough (good thing we were in the sun).Service was friendly and professional, but slow. My water was rarely refilled and they seem to really want you to have a nice long leisurely meal so dishes are spaced out quite a bit. I think we spent over two hours there. If I come back, I'm definitely getting more of that Tempura Courgette Flower.",

To begin with: the ma\u00eetre d' didn't even bother to acknowledge my presence when I showed up with my companion, let alone allow me to engage in conversation with him to get us both a table. This pattern continued even upon ordering, which made me wonder if I even felt welcomed. I already had high expectations before I even walked in based on what I had heard about the place, so this was a seriously bad first impression on me.The food was nothing to shout about either. For a restaurant that prides itself in its meats, let's just say I've had better medium-rare steaks at places that don't even specialize in steaks.Although it does redeem itself somewhat with a great, great ambience. But that's probably not enough for a repeat visit.Getting the check at the end of our meal was another challenge in itself: regardless of how busy a restaurant is (and it wasn't even filled to capacity), is it really necessary to play a game of attempting to make eye contact with your waiter for a good ten minutes?Guys, if you're listening, please ramp up your customer service if you can't do anything about your food: it's the least you can give your customers, considering how great the layout of your restaurant is.",

    "text": "Smiths of Smithfield has undergone a few facelifts since it opened in 2000 next to the Smithfield meat market. Spanning across four floors and hosted in a Grade II listed building, it's always boasted impressive environs with modern-industrial-chic details. The ground floor is a bustling hub that dishes out a satisfying and straightforward menu in a casual setting. There are two additional restaurants with more exquisite modern British fare on the upper floors, including a rooftop dining space with panoramic city views. A short walk from Farringdon station, it's a catch-all venue where you can either grab a drink after work, or can dig into a succulent fillet steak in more opulent ambiance. Or you could do both- it only requires migrating between floors.I admittedly hadn't visited Smiths in over five years until this week. During our last call, we popped in for brunch in the days when John Torode was still owner and overseer of operations- in fact, he was lurking around the restaurant that very afternoon, entertaining family and acquaintances sitting adjacent to our table. Since then, Torode has parted company with Smiths and the business has pulled its socks up- especially the first floor space, which was once a tapas bar, then a cocktail lounge, but now reinvented as a craft beer bar, the Craft Market.We revisited Smiths, lured in by an event that was taking place at the Craft Market. I'd been tempted by the 'Meet the Brewery' evenings promoted on social media in the past- some laudable London independent breweries were advertised, including Brixton Brewery, East London Brewing Company and Canopy Brewing Co- but I'd never managed to make the journey. Frankly, I've been let down by a glut of City establishments promoted as 'craft beer bars' due to appalling service by staff with no knowledge of their range or gusto at all. Because of such discouraging experiences, I'd erroneously tarred Smith's with the same brush. We were pleasantly surprised on our visit in August 2016. There to support a friend's event, we lingered for the entire evening and chatted with servers, bar staff and the Operations Manager. One point was immediately apparent: they had a bona fide passion for beer. The hirsute gentleman running the bar had a dry sense of humour and knew the bar's range inside out. He assured us that he personally curated the selection available- and it was a good balance of the classics (Sierra Nevada, Blue Moon, Camden) with the independents, including \u00a0a selection from Hammerton, Redchurch, London Beer Factory, Kernel and Partizan but to name a few. The copious bottle selection dominates the room, positioned against the wall behind the bar like a magnificent example of modern art. Bottles can be taken away or swilled onsite- naturally, there are chilled, ready to drink vessels in the fridges- and there's a rotating pick served on draught. For \u00a315, you can pick up 6 bottles to take home in a carrying case, which is both convenient and affordable if you work in the area. Otherwise, the bar itself is cosy, friendly and urbane; we were there on a Wednesday night and there were a few other groups, but the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed. We even had a decent burger, chips and a pint of the guest draught for a tenner- it was promptly delivered to our table, meaning that we could continue to graze on the beer menu without having to relocate to a different floor for sustenance.Speaking with the Operations Manager, he informed me that they have big plans for further meet the brewer events at the Craft Market down the line- I was asked what beers I was currently drinking from London breweries and it transpires that the first I mentioned- my local haunt, Howling Hops- was due to be stocked at the bar in the coming weeks. I can confidently say that I'll be returning to Smiths, especially once more events are announced- the space is the perfect size for a quiet post-work beer. The advantage of having more than one bar in the building allows this area to concentrate on independent breweries, which can be enjoyed in a unexpectedly convivial atmosphere. Paired with friendly and conversant staff, this floor of Smiths is really a gem- and you'll be seeing even more breweries on their shelves soon. It pains me to spread the word because I'd like to keep this place in my back pocket, especially given the blight of decent drinking venues in the area, but I'm feeling generous after having a few great beers.",

    "text": "Our dinner at the Top Floor at Smiths of Smithfield was very disappointing. I had been there a couple years back and it was fantastic so i had high hopes, unfortunately it was a completely different experience. The venue was fairly empty but it did fill up later in the evening. We had a round of cocktails which were decent I suppose. The starters were average, nothing special, not worth it, nothing stood out. The squid dish was not very good at all. Main course, 2 sirloins and one rump steak, I can only speak for my sirloin but for a place that looks to sell \"rare breed beef, they are joking. My sirloin was super thin, so it was overpriced but more importantly than that, it was overcooked, had a fair amount of fat on one side - it looked like some \u00a0basic supermarket steak, really disappointing. Coffees were ok, the dessert was terrible - coconut dacquoise, the cake part was soaked in rum, there are alcoholic cakes which taste good but whoever made this one wanted to drown the cake, you literally took a bite and the alcohol gushed out, and all you tasted was rum, really disgusting. Food at restaurants can be bad, it happens but the icing on the cake was the service, I've never seen such a rude guy, he couldn't be bothered to say thank you or your welcome, nor smile. The best part was splitting the bill 4 way and before going to the second card he muttered under his breath loudly, \"jesus Christ\". As soon as that was done, it told him to take the service off, it was that insulting. Told the manager about this untrained moron of a waiter who apologized and offered to take the sour taste away with champagne but no thanks. We will never go back, I strongly advise you not to waste your time on this restaurant, its overpriced and not even good. There are so many better places for steak and the service, even McDonalds is better. Sadly we wasted our time but you don't need to.",

Don't think my glass ever even reached half empty (let alone empty, empty) as the prosecco just kept flowing. The staff are really friendly and helpful and offered great service - I was really impressed with this place. The only reason Smiths isn't getting a 5* is the fact the seats aren't really comfy as they were low stools (the \u00a0seats for bigger groups were long benches so again didn't look very comfy). Also my mum wasn't impressed with the fact the poached egg had a solid yolk. If they had proper seats with backs and not just wooden blocks to sit on I would definitely award 5 stars. But saying that, I would definitely go back....the chocolate waffles were devine!!!",

I was looking for old school pork with some fat. I asked several times to make sure the pork would be cooked medium. I wanted to see pink. I was assured this would be the case.The pork comes out WAY over cooked. I asked about it, and the server said she'd ask the chef. The chef comes out. I tell the story while the others at the table agree I was pretty much over the top about wanting it pink. The Chef says that cooking it that way causes disease. It has to be well done. I'll skip the back and forth. In the end, he said he'd cook it that way, but take no responsibility for when I got sick. Even in the US, the USDA, the most conservative of groups, has dropped the temp for cooking pork from 160 to 145.So, in the end, decent pork. Nice wine. A great group of coworkers and clients to be with. That makes up for the cooking.",

    "text": "I went to Smiths for the first time on Sunday, and I have to say I am very sorely unimpressed! I redeemed Timeout's \u00a320 bottomless brunch offer with them, and everything from the reservation process to the food to the service was a nightmare!To reserve, you must send through your voucher number and security codes as detailed in the fine print. That's fine, however, I was clearly corresponding with several different staff members through their one inbox as I was asked to provide the same information on two occasions. If the staff had scrolled down in the thread this could have been easily avoided, and would have lead to having a much more professional service.The day before the reservation, I received a voicemail asking to confirm my reservation. I returned the call to confirm accordingly, but the woman on the line could not find my reservation! Absolutely ridiculous as she had called 15 minutes prior to confirm it! It ended up being that my reservation was not booked under my name which I had given in the original emails to reserve. See above regarding lack of communication and professionalism via email correspondence!Upon arrival at Smiths, we were greeted by a very sullen and unfriendly young woman who took a good minute or so to find our names on the reservation list. We were then seated at a tiny round table next to a pillar, which effectively made the space even smaller. Very disappointing for having had a reservation for over two weeks in advance! Upon arrival of our server, he noticed that we were having the bottomless brunch and before asking any questions (i.e.. how are you, can I get you any drinks) he demanded I show him my voucher number and security code. Not only was this beyond rude, I was not informed prior to coming that I would additionally be required to have a paper copy. The sullen hostess did not mention it upon seating us either. After finding the information requested on my phone, I had the humiliating and more frustrating than anything experience of having to confirm this with not just the server and hostess, but what appeared to be a more experienced server or manager as well. Standing at the front entrance with three staff members as they painstakingly confirmed each character of all four codes was ridiculous and maddening to the point where we almost felt we should leave entirely.Once they had confirmed the reservation, they did not apologise whatsoever for the inconvenience or thank me for providing the codes (again!) but simply said \"it's fine\". As the room we were in (Ground Floor Cafe) was exceptionally humid for a cloudy day, we asked to be seated outside. This was not a problem, other than the fact that the servers rarely ever made their rounds outside. After our first round of drinks (we chose mimosas) we sat outside for 10 minutes before I had to go inside to request more drinks. For a \"bottomless\" brunch, I found this to be terribly poor service.When our food finally arrived, it was truly disappointing. I wish I had taken a photo to show as proof! It arrived 30 minutes past ordering and was the stingiest sized portion (think child's meal) I've seen. I had ordered a avocado on toast with poached eggs, but got ONE piece of Tesco quality bread, a thin smear of avocado (just a bit more than what peanut butter on toast would be like) and two eggs so well done that they were NOT poached, but practically hard boiled! There was no oozing yolk in either of them, the yolks were hard all the way through BOTH! Honestly, I was so excited for this brunch and had such high expectations, but was very very disappointed in the whole experience. I'm not even a moaner and this is the first time I've felt I needed to post a review of this nature, as the service was just truly astonishingly horrible. There was not one redeeming factor either (i.e., good food bad/bad service or good service/bad food), as the entire trip we made out to Smiths was a waste of time and money.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUs\u2026",

    "text": "I would give this place 0 stars if I could. This was the single worst dining experience I have ever had in London. Service was terrible, food took forever to come out (45 min for breakfast?) and the food was horrendous. We purchased a timeout voucher for the bottomless drink brunch. Biggest waste of money we have ever spent and we will never visit this pathetic excuse for a restaurant again. When we arrived, they sent us to the third floor despite us explaining we had a timeout voucher and a reservation. When we got upstairs, we were told our reservation was for the first floor. Back down we go, waiting 10 minutes to be seated because they were so busy and had to figure out how to squeeze us in... When we made the reservation, we were very clear about it being for breakfast.When we were finally seated, the server told us we could have anything on the menu. I go to order pancakes, to be told it's not included in our voucher. We wait another 10 minutes for the manager to decide whether I would be allowed to order the pancakes. He took a further 5 minutes to 'debate with the head chef' as they were 'so busy, he doesn't have time to make anything not included on your voucher.' To be clear, the voucher does not disclude pancakes in its t&cs and its on the menu... So someone not using the voucher could order it? So would it still be such an inconvenience to the chef then? Finally I am allowed to order the pancakes and we receive our mimosas. We wait ages between refills. after 45 minutes the food finally arrives and it is horrendous. My pancakes are raw batter on the inside, the French toast tastes burnt and bitter and the waffles are burnt to a crisp. My partners poached eggs have a solid yoke, his bacon is rock solid and burnt, his hash browns are clearly out of a frozen pack and his hollandaise sauce tastes like butter.This is the worst place I have ever had breakfast. Stay away from this disaster of a restaurant.",

Mine had the distinct taste of lime which cut into the gin nicely and my husband's raspberry tipple was incredibly sweet. He liked it and they are too easy to suck down!As for the meals, I ordered the Jerusalem Artichoke, Ricotta & Pine Nut Pithivier, Wild Mushroom Sauce (v) for 14 1/2 pounds and he got the 9oz South Devon Rib Eye, Chips, Mustard Mayo for 23 pounds My dish was PHENOMENAL.Holy cow. Holllllllllllly cow. Rich, creamy sauce with thick raviolis bursting with mushroom essence. I closed my eyes several times while eatng.My husband said his dish was OK- nothing spectacular.I also go the BOMBAY FIZZ-Devaux Champagne, Bombay Gin, Passion Fruit Puree, Gomme \u00a0for 12 pounds. Went down way too quickly again!For dessert, we split the Chocolate Delice, Pistachio Sauce, Chocolate Biscuit for 6 1/2 pounds. I again closed my eyes at the first and consecutive bites. One of the best chocolate desserts ever? Quite possibly. Also the Pecan Pie, Chantilly Cream, Rum Toffee Sauce for 7 pounds is possibly the best pecan pie I have tasted since the States.Service was hit or miss- I had to go up to the hostess table to get an initial server. At times a separate one checked in on us and other times, we were ignored.",

    "text": "This review is only for the top floor - maybe the bottom floor that is more casual and has craft beers, burgers, and more snack-like food is better, but I was disappointed with the top floor, fine-dining experience. It's not an inexpensive meal by any means, and for dinner and ~3 glasses of wine for the table, we each spent about $75-80 per person, which is not cheap. There's certainly better food in London at this price range.The place was super empty on a Monday evening, and there was maybe one or two other parties on the top floor while we were dining, so I'm not sure why the service was so painfully slow. It felt like an eternity for the food to come out.- Steak Tartare, Bloody Mary, Stout Pickled Onions, Smoked Egg Yolk \u00a0(\u00a312.5) - Really delicious steak tartare, with the egg yolk on top that complemented it perfectly. I'd recommend this, and would get it again.- White Peach, Burrata, Black Olive, Cracked Pepper, Basil (\u00a313) - This was one of the better burrata dishes that I ate during my week-long stay in London (having also eaten it at Spring and Padella). The burrata was fresh and paired nicely with the sweetness of the peach.- Rare Breed Sampler (\u00a384) - 280gm/10oz Rump, 280gm/10oz Sirloin, 200gm/7oz Fillet \u00a0- The meat was good, as I would expect for a steakhouse. We split the sampler amongst 3 people, which was a good amount of food. You could do the sampler for up to 4 people also, and just add more sides. I wasn't sure which cut of meat was what while I was eating it, so I can't tell you what was the best of the 3, but the quality of the meat was good and it was cooked to our liking.- Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese (\u00a37) - The noodles in the mac & cheese were small, and not your traditional elbow macaroni. Wasn't sure where the lobster was, since I didn't really see/taste too much of it, but the cheese they used was excellent and it was tasty. Just not sure they should tout it as lobster macaroni when it's hard to find/taste the lobster.- Creamed Spinach (\u00a35) - You can't really go wrong with creamed spinach, it had a ton of cream in it, so it tasted good, but they almost put too much cream, as it was slightly on the watery side.All in all, it was a good meal, but minus stars for the service, and the price for what you got. I expected much better service if I was paying this much for a nice steak meal, and it took the server almost 30-45 min to bring us the check at the end of the meal. I could have probably left the restaurant and they wouldn't even have noticed. This is fine for a business meal if you're not paying out of your own pocket, but there are a lot of other high end restaurants for better prices out there. Not sure I would come back.",

Our food didn't come until after 2pm and though it was nicely presented they obviously struggled with our party size as it was clear most of the food had been sat on the side waiting.I ordered a rare steak and what arrived was cold and grey on the inside. My two other colleagues who ordered steak also complained of similar quality. The burgers were dry and lacking and salad or onions. The only positives were the chips and the pork belly dish.Would absolutely not recommend. We were so annoyed we asked for the service to be taken from the bill. Considering this place is easily \u00a320 a head not including starters, desserts or a second drink I think they really need to sort out the quality.",

    "text": "It's difficult to know how to approach a review for Smiths, as it's very much an acquired taste. We've been here many times, at different times of day and during busy and quiet times. Our overall impression is that, yes, it seems a couple of quid more than other places on average, but the food is also above average, albeit simple fare such as bacon butties and porridge.Its industrial appearance gives away its heritage (it was a building that stood empty for 40 years before being given a makeover), and it feels like you could be in New York. You could be mingling with families, bikers and city slickers when you visit, and the staff will make sure you get as good as anyone in terms of service quality, which is casual and friendly.You simply can't beat the porridge, which doesn't feel microwaved (I'm imagining a large cauldron that's lovingly prepared by an oat expert with a big stick). Toast is chunky, tea is tea-y and the bacon is generously piled between two blankets of what feels like homemade bread (or at least bought in from a decent bakery).So, because we always love coming here, and it lacks pretentious airs and graces, and does a fantastic porridge with banana and honey, it gets top marks. We'll forgive the tart orange juice.(Please note that this review is based on our downstairs experience. We haven't been upstairs yet.)",

It's nice, and it hits the spot.I swap my chips for a salad - for which they are really generous and the dressing is yum.Perfect spot for a quick team lunch - that's probably why we always end up going back!",

I love their big square tables, the openness of the dining room and the food was pretty good as well. Downsides: you can't have their beer in the dining room, even though you can have it downstairs at the bar, you have a different bar menu upstairs. Which just doesn't make sense. We got it only after we asked our waitress to ask her manager. And another bad thing is that the men's bathroom is facing an office building across the street and people can see you if you're using the urinals, as there is nothing covering the windows.",

Famous for it's meat dishes (it's a steak lovers paradise- I opted for a smoked eel starter followed by the daily special of steak and kidney pudding) the fish dishes are amazing too with all the fish being nothing less than perfectly cooked. The service is brilliant, all the wait staff are incredibly knowledgable about the menu and the wine. All the food is carefully sourced and excellent all round. The views are lovely over the city of london, this is an exceptional restaurant and you can tell that a lot of thought has gone into every element of it. Well done Mr Torode!",

The bacon sandwiches are heaven but I also love the waffles with honey. If you are lucky, you might run into a pre wedding party, which is a lot of fun. The top levels have a gorgeous view of London.

For example the bottom floor is a bar and the top floor is a Gastro restaurant. As part of a business debrief I went to the top floor with workmates. I enjoyed the food quite a bit, but based on the premise that this is the 'best steak restaurant' in London I felt let down when I compared the quality and taste to one of the Gaucho's I have also been to. The menu is quite small and most of us had a steak of one type or another, no one was disapointed, but equally no one was raving about it. The price was also very high. Afterwards we retired downstairs to the large bar area. The cocktail and drinks menu was pretty tired and the very dim lighting couldn't hide the very rough decor. So overall, not quite sure what to make of this. Good food, but perhaps losing its way like the market nearby.",

The bottom floor, always busy, is a lot more casual, complete with leather couches, and serves some great grub for breakfast. The floors become more formal (and so does their price) as you move up in the building. John Torrode, the owner, doesn't seem to have any problems mixing food from different regions and sometimes the menu reads like an international gathering. Fortunately each dish that I've had here always seems to be perfectly done. I have to give extra mention to their perfect pork belly dish, as I normally don't eat the skin yet I couldn't think about wasting any part of theirs.",

They serve traditional British fare - heavy on meat of course but you can also eat eels and other English delicacies. Prices are on the high side - possibly too high for what you get your plate. That, with sometimes distracted service, are the only downsides.",

The parking is also free in December in the spiral carpark opposite, otherwise its only a few \u00a3's. The only reason I havent given 5 stars, is I found it difficult to find free range chicken there.

Not sure about the others, but my partner was then violently ill for 3 days after that and he still can't eat normally now.
