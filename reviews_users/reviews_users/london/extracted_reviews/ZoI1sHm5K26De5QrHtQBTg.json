But a 2-for-1 offer is too good to pass and a trip to Soho too much of an efford on a rainy Sunday afternoon.I just love the thali idea of being served a variety of delicious dishes. This latest one consisted of black pepper chicken - delicious and with loads for fresh herbs and spices in evidence - plus coconut potatoes and a lovely mixed vegetable curry, as well as thali, pilau rice, papadom and pickles. A very filling and most delicious meal. We opted for the lassi and chaas which complemented the food perfectly.Admittedly the ambience does not hide the fact that this is a fast food outlet, but this type is of the highest quality and a lot more interesting than food at a similar price.They are currently running a 2-for-1 deal which unfortunately will expire on 9 December.",

But I am afraid that the quality of the food has become really disappointing.The curries are very powdery, the naan breads are dry (feels like they have been waiting around for a while).Something particularly annoying with the Earls Court branch: the bottled drinks are very warm - whether it's water or red wine you are ordering. So you end up having to put ice cubes to cool things down - which is ok for water but less brilliant for red wine. Still nice decor, but even at the reasonable prices the food is poor value for money.",

On the outside, the restaurant looked very stylish, warm and inviting and reasonably busy. Upon entering we were showed to a table within moments by friendly staff. The decor was bright and contemporary with interesting touches like the suspended bamboo ceiling and clever lighting. The menu selection was impressive. Many dishes I hadn't seen in other Indian restaurants were featured. The service was excellent, staff were very attentive. The food arrived reasonably promptly was delicious, full of flavour and spice. We were even able to use a discount card which gave us up to 50% off despite it being Valentines day! Our bill total came to a very impressive \u00a322 including service charge. On the whole, I highly rate this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone in the area and beyond. They have several branches across London and assume you will receive a similar experience at their other locations.",

    "text": "I agree with the previous reviewer about the set menu -- it is overpriced and the choice is poor. However the a la carte selection is very broad and also extremely good value for money. Food is usually presented on a thali, with rice, chipatti/naan, a curry of your choice, as well as three smaller dishes (dahls, etc.) that the chefs change every day. It's a fantastic way to eat for \u00a38-\u00a310. Having said all this, you are by no means obligated to eat from a thali; you can order food presented in a more common anglo-indian fashion if you prefer. The two curries I've tried at Masala Zone are butter chicken and rogan josh. In both cases the curries were properly spiced and the meat was extremely tender but still well cooked. I was particularly impressed by the lamb. The starters are very tasty but perhaps not as good value as the thalis. Aloo tikka chaat, and the dabalrotis in particular are worth trying. Masala Zone is very attractive inside; the are deep red and brown murals on the walls and pleasant lighting. The atmosphere is very relaxed and there is always a diverse mix of people there. The service is prompt and polite (though perhaps a bit unreliable at times). Later in the evenings it can get pretty busy, but I would consider this a good thing. If you arrive before 6.30pm then you have the option of a cheaper set menu. Don't be afraid of not being able to get a table later on -- as long as you arrive before 8pm there shouldn't be a problem. It can be very difficult to find a good indian restaurant in London; I've been caught out many times by indian restaurants that look good from the outside, but are in fact overpriced with poor food and service. Masala Zone is, on the other hand, reliable, original and very good value.",

The staff has always been pleasant.The bad: Spice-wise, it's a bit on the mild side. The tikka masala is a bit blah, sadly. Stick with the thalis or the apps and you'll be good to go.

If you are in the mood for a leisurely well made indian dinner, and don't mind paying a little more, \u00a0this is the place to go. Its all about your expectations. They added a 12.5% obligatory tip. I thought that was on the high end. I can understand 10%.

They had a great selection of Thali's which is a selection of foods on a big metal tray including meats ( or vegetarian dishes ) or both, naan or chapati, pappadam, sauces, rice and dal for a decent price from 11 to 15 English pounds. I choice the Madras Railway chicken which had a brown cinnamon spice creamy sauce that was lovely. The Butter Chicken was also a yummy flavorful delight. The dal was perfect, slightly runny and filled with herbs, the garlic naan was not too garlicy so I would beg for cheese naan next time ( although it says you can only substitute garlic or plain naan for your chapati for a supplement of 1-2 English Pounds.Unfortunately our group of 7 had to be seated at 2 different tables so call ahead if you have a big group. This is a chain restaurant that doesn't feel like a chain. I have traveled to India and this place rivals the flavors from my trip yet not the price (of course)!I am planning on eating here every time I visit London.",

Stayed in this area on vacation and ended up eating here two of three nights. Authentic food, open late, friendly service. The interior is very lively with sound of many languages representing the diverse London population. Wish they'd expand their chain to the States :D",

The atmosphere of this place made me feel like I was back in India with the dark setting and the aroma from the kitchen. \u00a0 We ordered a variety of starters including the Sev Puri and Dahi Puri. \u00a0They were all delicious and I could have eaten it all by myself! For my main course, I chose the thali which is a traditional Indian platter loaded with little bowls of various treats. \u00a0Everything I tried was good. \u00a0The most amusing thing for me about this place is fact that they had Masala Coke. \u00a0I first had a Masala Coke in Delhi, India. \u00a0I remember tasting this creation on the streets of Delhi thinking that my friends had pulled a joke on me. \u00a0It was quite possibly the worst thing I'd ever tasted. \u00a0So when I saw this rancid thing on the menu here at Masala Zone, I realized that my friends back in India had not pulled a joke on me. \u00a0I had to try it again here at Masala Zone and while it still wasn't very good, it was a lot better than the one I had back in Delhi. \u00a04 stars for Masala Coke and making me feel like I was back in India.",

The service couldn't be better.. it's almost too good with the people who work here checking every 5 seconds if you are enjoying your food. But in the end the food just wasn't that great and you'd be far better off seeking out a cheaper and more authentic experience.If you do go here I recommend the appetizers and veggie dishes. The butter chicken and paneer tikka masala were both pretty disappointing. I can't even put my finger on what they were missing, but they were definitely lacking something. At first I thought it was just me but my boyfriend noticed right away too. We've frequented some amazing Indian restaurants in NYC, San Diego, + LA and my boyfriend has traveled through India so I think we have a good enough background to tell..Now I know tikka masala isn't \"real\" food from India, but we do like it a lot and heard London is of course the place to have it.. I guess that added to our disappointment. Like I said, go for the veggie based stuff and the more India-based dishes. Large thali can be shared with 2 people, although they didn't seem very happy to do this even though we also ordered a large appetizer. Veg dishes are worth at least a 4-5 star rating, but those tikka masala dishes are definitely in the 2 star range. My boyfriend did enjoy his \"Masala Coke\" although I found it to be kind of gross!",

Recent lunch experiences have been very good - they do a two-course option for \u00a37.95, so you can get a decent, varied meal, with a drink, for about a tenner. This certainly adds depth to the stock of restaurants in Earl's Court, which was lacking a good Indian.",

I ordered the Chaas (spiced lassi) from the drink menu- \u00a0It was average. I felt the mixture of spices used did not liven up the lassi as it should have. \u00a0For starters, I ordered a festival special (Jalebi chaat). \u00a0I thought it was going to be sweet but it was interesting with a savory shaped in the form of a jalebi. \u00a0For the main course, I ordered Khichadi and Undhiyo instead of a Thali. \u00a0Masala Zone offers a variety of Thali options ( Veg, Prawn, Lamb, Chicken). The version of Khichadi and Undhiyo served here was very different from the ones I have had in typical Gujarathi places. \u00a0The Khichadi was drier than what I am used to (had the consistency closer to a pulao). \u00a0The Undhiyo had the typical vegetables that one uses but the masala was again different than the ones I have had earlier ( again a drier version with coconut and not as sweet or spicy). \u00a0Nevertheless, it was good.All in all a decent experienceAmbience: GoodNoise: Quiet (on a Sat afternoon)Food: Fresh and had an interesting SpinService: pleasant staff but service was very slow on a Sat afternoon though it was not crowded.Recommend it: Worth trying",

I ordered some steam rice on the side. It was really tasty and spicy as I was expecting !Masala zone is good restaurant to go when you want Indian food and you are not sure about the other places around.",

Clearly the group understand the restaurant business (Veeraswamy, Chutney Mary, Amaya), but its as if they're letting their entry-level spot just fizzle and die.",

We went for the regular round platter (Thali) inspired by india's real street food...looking around us, there were actually a few indians in the room, and that's always a good sign right? Well yes it definitely was. My Rogan Josh was perfectly spiced & cooked, and so was my wife's Chicken Butter, 2 pretty classic dishes, but (Rogan) Gosh!, this was out of this world...the chutney, the dhal...everything was just amazing. Oh, did I tell you I really liked it? :) Anyway, I wrote a review on a famous indian restaurant that is victims of its own success (well, not really victim, you're the victim waiting 2 hours in the queue), and this is exactly what I was talking about...those indian restaurants that offer amazing quality at reasonable price, well Masala Zone is spot on. Yes it's a chain, no it's not intimate, but for good casual indian food, this is my spot.",
