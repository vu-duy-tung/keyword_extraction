I would recommend siting at the bar because you can chat to the bar staff as well as seeing drinks being made.The food was very good. From the cold counter we had roasted aubergine, walnut yogurt and pomegranate which you cannot go wrong with. Also ordered was a grilled tuna, soy honey, spring onion and ginger dish. Thi was incredibly fresh and tasty too. Some good meatiness to have next to the veg dish.From the kitchen \u00a0we ordered hake, tomato harissa, shrimps and kohirabi. This was nice though the sauce wasn't my favourite. Another fish dish of mackerel (prob my favourite fish to eat) came with miso caramel, papaya, pulled carrot and peanut. This was good too but the portion left a lot to be desired.For dessert we shared a carrot cake, which came with some custard. This was insanely good. For someone without a sweet tooth this was a perfect end.All in all the wines and cold counter dishes and dessert made this is a good experience that would make me come back for more.",

This new edition to the Ottolenghi family is far more spacious than the other restaurants with ample eat in space. It's the same light and airy atmosphere that you get in other stores. but you are no sharing long benches with strangers this time - you can get your own table. Hurrah.The deal is the same. Piles of salads awaits you. I think there are other options to but I never bother to look at those as the salads are beautiful. I didn't have a dessert here but I imagine they are as good as they are in other branches. \u00a0 The greeting from maitre de was slightly frosty at first, but I think she slightly stressed out by a recent incident. She then did her best to be make it up to us and friendliness resumed. \u00a0Food here is always very good - but you have to know what you are expecting - aka Middle Eastern inspired salads - aka these are cold. Drinks are also mighty fine - there are even boozy cocktail options. I will always be a happy chappy if you take me here. Hint hint hint readers.",

People were still having breakfast and by seeing what they had, I am thinking of going back to try it. They even had toaster plugged in the ceiling, being dropped on their tables to individually grill their own toasts. Beautiful. When you get inside this restaurant, you get to see the food you get. It is exposed right in your face at the entrance for you to see. I did not really know what was going on so I though you could eat from a salad bar, or while seating. Not really, it is to go or to stay. We sat and ordered delicious plates. Especially the eggplants. I was surprised to see rather big plates coming. For a healthy chic restaurant, I was more expecting to see small tapas style plates but no. Staff is very friendly, and made you feel right at home. It very looks like the best place to get breakfast in town, seriously. With all the nice lights, staff and food, there is no way you could be disappointed while there. Will go back if in the area, and meanwhile, will try the other locations out west of the city.",

Literally, food artistry. The many salads to choose from were colorful and varied and, to my liking, plenty of light, healthful options. The final decision was arduous to come to.Following a meal, there are just as many desserts as entrees (if not more) to choose from. So you absolutely are obligated to save room. For they are epic.Chat with the bar staff (I lingered past the lunch rush) for they are charming and entertaining human beings.

I had heard good stories about Ottolenghi and I have extensively browsed through the recipes that are published on the Ottolenghi website. I was delighted to see the salad bar when I entered the restaurant. I am no vegetarian, but have for years preferred to plan the dishes I eat around vegetables. I feel that vegetables are truly made the hero of each dish in this restaurant. Moreover the flavour combinations you are presented with are really interesting and not predictable in the slightest. A minor point of critique is that the proteins you can order to go with the salad are also served cold and I didn't expect this. The salmon and the beef my mother and I tried were still delicious though. Good, inspirational food? Check.Vegetables? Check.Nice, clean and light ambiance? Check.Friendly staff? Check.",

I have been to some of the other Ottolenghi restaurants but this one had a very different vibe. Instead of the typical Ottolenghi choice of a selection of salads in a big bowl, this one has all the salads listed tapas style. Making them easy to share with a group. There were also options of hot tapas rather than the usual cold premade salads. We went with the aubergine (always a hit at an Ottolenghi place) the green beans, the scallops, the seared tuna, the lamb, and the labneh. The scallops and the ahi tuna were both amazing, and the sauce that came with the tuna was divine. I found myself pouring it over the remainder of the green bean dish, as I felt it needed a bit more flavor. We made sure not to order too many dishes.. so that we had room for some of their decadent desserts. I went with the maple, apple cake which was delicious and moist and sent me into a sugar coma quickly after.",

The seating area was uncomfortable, every time patrons walked in or a Deliveroo driver came in we felt the chills of the evening.We downsized our order because the seating situation was just too uncomfortable. However the two dishes we had were excellent and packed with flavor. Note that this is more of a tapas styled restaurant so you'll need to consider that when ordering.

Service was a tad slow but the restaurant was full so I understand. Food quality and flavor was really good and the artisanal bread was really fresh.

We snagged a reservation to this Ottolenghi location relatively easily, and then we were off for our dinner the next evening. I liked how the restaurant was located on a teeny street. You sorta get that secret feeling even though judging from how packed the place was, Ottolenghi is no secret.Internationally-influenced Middle Eastern tapas are the name of the game here. You get to choose from two lists: \"From the Counter\" and \"From the Kitchen.\" Basically \"Cold and Already Prepared\" and \"Hot and Will Need to be Cooked in the Kitchen.\" Prices are in the \u00a310-15 range.Our server recommended 5 plates for 2 people, and she was right on. Well, she didn't include dessert, so 5+2. I am not sure if I had a favorite dish (can it be a five-way tie?). I was really impressed with the veggies at Ottolenghi. I could be a vegetarian if I lived here, no doubt. Lamb rump, pan fried sea bream, pan roasted cauliflower, roasted aubergine, and broccolini were all delightful and crazy flavorful.For dessert, I opted for the carrot cake. The portion size was reasonable, though taste-wise I think I've made carrot cakes before that were better. There are more desserts available than what's listed on the menu though; check at the front counter.Service was very polite though got a little less attentive in that lull after mains and before dessert. The bathrooms are downstairs and consist of a bunch of stalls for men and women to use.I was reading about Chef Ottolenghi on Wikipedia, sounds like an interesting guy. Grew up in Israel, has a masters in comparative literature, and loves Pilates. Dubbed \"the man who sexed up vegetables.\" True that.",

The dishes are in fact tapas sized and as such make it an expensive place for dinner. \u00a39.50 for what was a third of a leek with some cheese and bits and bobs is steep. The same again for broccoli and edamame beans with chilli is extortion. I was just expecting main sized portions- would have chosen a cheaper restaurant had I realised. Puddings were on the large size however and reasonably priced. Bottle of prosecco was \u00a336. ouch. and they forgot the tap water- a bug bear of mine.",

It's sort of like tapas sized portions so I got one salad and one hot food and it was just the right amount of food for the night. It was very fancy and delicious, I'd come back here to show off some of the more arty foods of London to anyone visiting!",

    "text": "My mum has been a massive fan of Ottolenghi for the past few years and is religiously collecting all of his cookbooks. (Mainly because I get them for her, but she really does love them!)So when I knew my parents were going to come and visit me in London, I was a bit of a nobrainer: I was going to invite her out to eat at the restaurant of her favourite chef ever.Having already experienced Nopi a few months back, I kind of knew what to expect. Excellent and relatively simple food without having to break the bank. Ottolenghi in Spitalfields offered a similar experience.I booked our table for 1pm a few weeks back - and I would recommend reserving if possible, it gets packed quickly.The venue is relatively simple and straightforward, and the service is fantastic.The lunch menu is a series of fresh cold dishes that you can pick a selection of for about \u00a315 per person (\u00a321 if you go for a cooked option).The mix of flavours, the quality of the ingredients and the size of the portion make it an excellent value for money experience. Note: if you are just passing by, it is possible to pick-up your lunch for a take-away as most of the lunch food is served cold. I would definitely recommend indulging in the deserts, completely worth ending a great meal on a sweet note.All-in-all: I really admire Ottolenghi for opening this easy-going and accessible venue where you can eat delicious food without having to re-mortgage your house. Both Nopi and this place are now on my top recommendations for places to eat in London - if you can get a reservation that is :)",

    "text": "Ottolenghi is a well known name whether its via the cookbooks or the restaurants. \u00a0so when i found out i was having a weekend in london and saturday morning called for a brunch date before parting from my boyfriend for the day i was super excited to see a Ottolenghi restaurant nearby our hotel. \u00a0now this wasn't my first brunch choice but after my other choice offered my the early 8:45am table time i decided the much later time at 9:30am at Ottolenghi was the way to go.the restaurant is on atillery lane about a 2 minute walk from liverpool street station. \u00a0it's all clean lines, and white space which makes the whole place feel airy and fresh. \u00a0there's a white bar along the front of the restaurant and a massive table with all their cakes and salads spread out right across from the entrance. \u00a0they had two long centre tables with toasters plugged in for people that ordered the bread board to make their own toast. (i find this an odd thing as if i want toast i'll save myself the money and just buy a loaf of bread from the market and toast it at home...restaurant toast on its own is way pricey).the breakfast/brunch menu isn't huge but has a good list of about 10 items to choose from. \u00a0all of them sounded delicious and even on the healthier side which is a bonus. \u00a0i went with the braised eggs, spinach, and leek and the boyfriend had the ham hock and butter bean stew with a fried egg. \u00a0we sipped on flat whites while waiting for our food which were strong but also really good.food arrived in good time and i was super pleased with what was put in front of me. \u00a0a wooden board with two pieces of fresh foccacia and a little skillet pan with two braised (similar to baked) eggs on top of a pile of sauteed leeks and spinach topped with preserved lemon oil and feta cheese. \u00a0it was a seriously moreish dish with super fresh eggs and runny yolks to mop up with the bread. \u00a0we also shared a side of avocado that although quite tasty was well over priced...since we had time, we had breakfast dessert and shared a pain au chocolat and an almond croissant. \u00a0 now i debated between 4 or 5 stars but then remembered the almond croissant and decided the extra start belonged to this croissant. \u00a0it was huge, freshly baked, and chock full of almond with buttery layers. \u00a0i'm sad that i'll need to visit london again in order to taste it! \u00a0the pain au chocolat was also really tasty but the winner of the meal was the almond croissant.so Ottolenghi lived up to expectations and more. \u00a0for a two course breakfast in london i thought the price was ok, \u00a320 each which isn't that experience when i think about what we had to eat and how fresh the ingredients were. \u00a0i'll happily re-visit one of his restaurants next time i make it to london.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place out as I have a few of Ottolenghi's cookbooks and have heard great things. Ultimately, while the service was impeccable, the food was good but had some issues and left me feeling underwhelmed.The restaurant is located in a charming neighbourhood and the interior is beautifully modern yet romantic. All of the dishes on the menu are small and intended to share. Our server was incredibly gracious. When we had questions about a certain category of wines on the menu, he brought out several small samples so we could understand the differences and try them out.As for the food - the aubergine was roasted to perfection and had a wonderful texture. The butternut squash was cooked to still have a bit of a bite, which was surprising but worked well with the tahini and sweet red onions. For the \"main\" mezzes, we got the lamb and beef kofta, quail, and cornish hake. All 3 dishes were tasty, but nothing to write home about. The last dish that we got was the burnt leeks, which was frankly unappetizing and difficult to eat because of the stringiness of the leeks. The biggest problem overall was that many our dishes lacked seasoning and were quite bland. Plus, texturally everything was quite... soft, so it felt like there wasn't much variation in what we were eating.By far the best plate of the night was the dessert which we picked out from the bakery window. The chocolate and sesame tart was rich and delectable - I would absolutely eat that again any time.Perhaps my expectations going in to Ottolenghi were too high, but given the hype and influence (and price point!) of this restaurant, I guess I was hoping for something spectacular or more imaginative.",

Coming from NYC I prebooked our dinner in advance to make sure that we will have a chance to dine here during our short stay in London. The place is beautiful, and the service is great as well. That deserves some stars. However, the description of food, the prices, and the flavour all failed. I grew up with middle eastern food, and I lived in Israel. Most importantly my shelves at home are lined with various spices. Unfortunately, somwhere along the line someone failed to translate the beautiful aromatic flavours of middle eastern food into the concept of this restaurant. Here in NYC, we are proud of the growing Israeli cuisine. Each restaurant has their own twist, but for the most part they all use spices appropriately. Long story short, this restaurant would not survive in NYC or Israel if the dishes were prepared the same way. My kofta did not have cumin. Everyone prepares it slightly different, but cumin is a must. All of the food was extremely bland and over salted. All of the food was too salty for everyone at our table. Everything was bland with no middle eastern flavour whatsoever. While the desserts looked great in the window, they were also bland and lacked flavour. The only thing that was good was the hazelnut meringue. I see that people go to this place, and I'm not judge of local flavour as we found food in London to be overall bland and over salted. Perhaps that's what the locals like. I'm not judging their tastes, and I see why they would go here because it's in line with the taste pallet. Nevertheless, this is not middle eastern food not modern nor traditional. Just a shame and waist of money.",

    "text": "Living 30 seconds from Ottolenghi means that I am in a state of constant temptation due to the scent of spiced apple bakers' confectionery emanating from the delicatessen side of this mini-franchise. I had the highest hope for this duet of sit-down restaurant meets grab-and-go counter, named after the Israeli-chef owner's namesake. The airy, modernistic interior is uncluttered, leaving you to concentrate firmly on the Med/Middle Eastern food. From the outside, particularly at night, it has a romantic yet sexy feel due to the dim lighting. Probably an upshot of it's heavy dependence on natural lighting by way of a middle room glass ceiling and and sleek glass walls. \u00a0I think our mistake was coming at 10pm for dinner - they had run out of the Cabrito goat shawarma which was what I was angling for. The wait staff appeared either tired or bored depending on the particular server and took ages to bring out wine, finally bringing the wrong one. I found the menu interesting but not especially inspiring. The duck confit with crushed artichoke and figs, which we both opted for, was lovely in flavour but the portions are rather small and the duck has been taken off the bone and put into almost a terrine-style cube. Just a slightly different image from the one I had in my head - of bone-on crispy and succulent skin. The artichoke and fig was absolutely impeccable allowing some forgiveness in the confusion. The portion of olives, which was at least 5 pounds, reaped around 12 olives without any oil or bread. Disappointing value for money. I had been promised, by goers before, that there would be toppling towers of colorful salads and vegetarian delights. Looking at the brunch menu and the lunch menu, we seem to have been deprived of this at dinner. I am intrigued by the Butter bean mash with padron peppers and jalepeno sauce, the roasted pumpkin with farro, date molasses and feta, and the butternut squash quiche with membrillo and stilton.I don't give up so easily, Ottelenghi. Expect an updated review soon.",

I need to find this recipe. I will come back for more desserts and to try their lunch or dinner options.Venue:There is an assortment of desserts and fresh items on display. The restaurant has window seating which is great for people watching. Very cozy and very modern decor. Close to the tube and close to Spitalfield market. Service:The staff was friendly and very helpful. They didn't shun me for bringing in my own tea on a cold rainy summer day. I'm pretty sure I was wet and shivering.",

When my group walked in the door at 1016 I was warned to move quickly because the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes? I asked why they took a reservation at 1015 then? No good response, no apology, no here is a free thing cause we messed up.Then of course had a rushed meal where the apps came out before the wine and the mains were out before the apps were finished. Of course the kitchen was out of several items. There were some good dishes (falafel for instance), but overall it was lacking especially the starters. Interesting one of the servers confirmed the current starters were not particularly good. I would have given it 3 stars on the food quality. Additionally when I went down to the bathroom they were in a total state of dis-repair. My desert was fantastic though. Overall for a restaurant with a great reputation this was a disgraceful performance that suggests they have expanded too fast",

Staff are friendly and attentive, and service is pretty quick even when it's busy. They do a lovely hot chocolate. I had the shakshuka - egg yolks cooked to perfection and mildly spiced. Their focaccia bread is toasted the way I like it - sprinkled with olive oil and put on a grill. They accidentally dropped one of my bread slices on the way to the table but immediately apologised and replaced with a whole plateful of bread - always appreciated! I've had the French toast here before but didn't like it as much, but that more reflects my own personal taste. Perfect brunch place for friends or taking your parents!",

    "text": "After hearing so many friends rave about Ottolenghi's recipes, I was expecting to be blown away by this place. The ambiance was nice (white linens, dim lighting and candles), and some of the dishes were standouts, but I found the menu to be a little bit hit or miss. Most dishes were definitely a bit on the pricey side, and the meal came out to about \u00a350-60 per person (we did order 3 drinks for a party of 4). I didn't find the service to be that great either - it was fine at the beginning but then it seemed like they forgot about us and it took an hour for the dessert + check to come and we were ready to be done with the meal.TL;DR: I'd probably give this - 3.5 stars. I think there are better places to eat in London at similar or cheaper price points. The best dishes for me: burrata with rhubarb and dates, and crushed carrot with labneh, and pork belly. We ended up getting doubles of the burrata and pork belly because we liked it so much.This is a nice place for 2, 4, or 6 people, but I think 4 is the optimal size so that you can share various dishes and be able to try enough things. They recommend 2 dishes per person, I think we ended up with about 10 dishes for our party of 4 because we repeated 2 of our favourite things. Some of the dishes only come with 3 pieces (like the pork belly) -- I wish they would accommodate it for 4 people and add an extra piece of meat and charge a little more -- some restaurants do this and it makes it much easier than trying to cut 3 pieces of pork belly into 4. Here are the dishes that I liked in the order that I liked them (best to worst):Burrata, rhubarb, dates and nigella seed caramel (\u00a311.50) - We all loved this one, we ordered a second one because one wasn't enough. The burrata was super fresh, the shredded (and maybe pickled) rhubarb and the dates were a nice sweet contrast to the savory, and there were a lot of different textures and flavors all in one dish. I'd highly recommend this!Crushed carrot and rose harissa with labneh, pistachio mint and pea shoots (\u00a39.50) - I wasn't that excited about this dishes -- I like carrots but don't love them, but this was fantastic. Really unique way to prepare and serve carrots, and the rose harissa and pistachio mint were so interesting in flavor. The pistachio added a nice texture. I'd highly recommend this also!Pork Belly, Kimchi, Pink Grapefruit, Salted Black Bean (\u00a312.50) - We ended up getting two of these because we didn't realize there were only 3 pieces of pork belly, not 4, and we had all eaten it. It's hard to share / cut the pieces of pork belly, so just plan accordingly for you party. The pork belly was great though and the skin was super crispy like a chicharron. The kimchi was great too but I preferred the pork belly alone so that I could really taste the pork belly. Great dish, and would recommend this!Roasted aubergine with tahini and miso yoghurt, almonds, chili and herbs (\u00a39.50) - This was good too, but not super unique - I've had eggplant before, and I liked it with the yoghurt and almonds. It was good, but it if I came back, I don't think I'd repeat it.Pan Fried Octopus with edamame, sprouts and white soy (\u00a312.50) - Proportionally, there wasn't much octopus in the dish. Every time I thought I'd be eating a piece of octopus, I was sadly eating a piece of edamame. Good, but not one of my favourite dishes.Spiced Pumpkin with Goat's Milk Labneh, Picked Grapes & Jalapeno (\u00a311.00) - There were not very many pieces of the pumpkin - almost just 1-1.5 cubes per person? Nothing super special.Yellow Fin Tuna with Soy, Ginger and Spring onion sauce (\u00a311.50) - There were only 3 pieces of thinly sliced tuna which makes this pretty pricey per piece of tuna. Nothing special here - I've had plenty of raw tuna in my life, and this was a disappointment.We got a lemon & mascarpone tart for dessert but didn't really care for this. It was too sweet and too sour all at the same time - maybe it could have used some meringue to balance it out, and the crust seemed a bit burnt. I would pass on their desserts.All in all, some dishes were hit or miss - some interesting flavour and texture combinations, but the entire meal didn't really make me jump up and down for excitement. I'd come back here again to eat if someone really wanted to come, but don't think I'd make it a regular place in my restaurants of choice or in my recommendations. There are better options out there for the money.",

We walked up to the location near Spitalfields, arriving at about 12:10 on a Saturday without a reservation. They took our names down and said to come back in 20 Minutes and we would have seats at the bar. We came back in time, and were immediately seated. I ordered a cappuccino and my cousin ordered an americano, which we both enjoyed. Then I chose a selection of 4 salads, and she had salmon with three salads. I had a sweet potato salad with spicy sauce and cheese, roasted cauliflower with grapes and hazelnuts, grilled broccoli with chillies, and a butter bean (I think) mash with okra. Everything was delicious. A bit spicy, very balanced, subtle flavours, and beautiful colours. At first when I saw my plate I thought it was going to be too small, but I could barely finish it in the end. My cousin also enjoyed her food, and we really liked sitting at the bar. The service was good, ambiance great, and I loved the gender neutral bathrooms. A bit expensive in my opinion (15 pounds for a plate of 4 salads), but perfect for an indulgent, veggie-focused lunch.",
