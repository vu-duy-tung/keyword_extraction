    "text": "This is the original Four Seasons restaurant - another branch has opened recently in Chinatown. It is famous among the Chinese community for having the best roast duck in town and the long queues snaking out of the door at the weekends attest to that fact. Apparently, their famous roast duck chef left last year but that \u00a0doesn't seem to have diminished any of its popularity.Now, just to clarify matters. Roast duck are the birds hanging up for display on the shopfront. Crispy aromatic duck is the deep fried duck starter served with pancakes, cucumber and plum sauce and is a peculiarly English dish - you can't find this in the Far East. Peking duck is another starter which has a much more elaborate preparation including the use of a bicycle pump to separate the skin from the flesh to ensure a crispy finish and is usually served in several courses.Four Seasons is famous for its roast duck and I love watching the chefs expertly dissecting the duck to feed the seemingly never endless queues of eager customers in the restaurant and waiting for takeaway. It fascinates me to watch any expert wield their tool of choice and the way the chefs use their huge meat cleavers to de-bone the duck is amazing. I just stand and watch at the window for ages sometimes.At busy periods, make sure that you leave your name and party size with the waiter just inside the door so you're in the queue for a table. Takeaway is also done in the cramped area just inside the door, so make sure you're not claustrophobic!The service is brisk as it has to be in such a popular place. You're offered the duck on or off the bone, which is fairly unique in my experience - they charge more for de-boning. There is also the usual Ango-Canto fare in a full menu but most people come for duck.So, is it the best duck in London? It's among the best but I find the accompanying sauce a bit too sweet.",

    "text": "Four Seasons. Oft repeated as the \"Best place to get Duck in London\" I am not that great a fan. I'll start with the fact, I've been here three times, which is probably sufficient to get to know a place enough to right a review. Now, a conumdrum: Q) Why does a restaurant have to have bad service and rude staff? A) It doesn't. This therefore is the starting point that knocks Four Seasons down. Every time, despite a reservation it's impossible to get to the table on-time. Small delays are always fine, but since you often are left standing outside in the cold long ones are not so acceptable. Combined with staff who either don't want to speak English or aren't paid enough to be polite, it's not the nicest experience. This is followed up with the food. Which should be the foundation of any restaurant. We've had the duck and we've had other dishes and despite some reasonably good reviews here we tend to feel a bit let down. Portions are small (especially of duck) for the expensive price and the taste is no more than might be expected at other Restaurants serving duck. After having been in China and being treated to a private event at the Beijing Quanjude Duck Restaurant this place is really far off-the mark. If it's worth paying significantly extra for something only marginally better than other Chinese restaurants then this may be one of the best places for Duck. But that best is not very good for the price. Other dishes were interesting, with some genuine authentic Chinese food. Some of the whole fish dishes are really nice and special, but again portion size might let you down and if that doesn't serving staff forgetting drinks orders, getting the wrong dish and then being rude about it might finish you off. If you want your table disinfected and sprayed when you're still trying to finish due to the next group of people booked too early coming in, also the right place for it. I don't normally like being negative, but I've been to plenty of great Chinese restaurants, with good food, competitive prices and decent staff. See \"My Old Place\" near Liverpool street for an example.",

Restaurant's could be good, bad or awful and from the outside there is absolutely no way of telling. The general technique I apply is to find a queue and join it. This is how I stumbled on Four Seasons. After a short wait we were directed up a very narrow staircase to what felt like it should be some body's living room. There must have been forty people in this tiny space but the atmosphere was absolutely buzzing because of it. With a reputation for being specialist's in 'Crispy Duck' we felt it would be bad of us not to give it a try. The duck was delicious and everything you would expect from a great Chinese restaurant. Our other course, Kung Po Prawns was also very nice, if a little too sweet for my tastes. If you're ever in the same situation as me and worrying which restaurant to go to in Chinatown, I'd recommend the Four Seasons over any of the others I've tried. Maybe don't take your vegetarian friends though, the meat display in the window might be a bit too much...",

The only catch with this place is that it's a very small restaurant and is just generally heaving. Having used to live in the area, I preferred to generally order takeaway since it almost feels like you're being rushed when you're inside given the crowd of people blocking the entrance. Like what you'd think most busy Chinese places are, there's no obvious queuing system and it feels like you have to almost push your way just to get your name down on their system. Still I like to think that their food is sometimes worth the wait although there are many, almost as good places to go around the area. Most of their other dishes are pretty high quality too and would definitely recommend the king prawn chow mein.",

This was because there was bigger tables available and the restaurant cannot justify allocating these tables to 2 people who instead of to bigger groups, as their reasoning is : bigger group-- bigger bill-- bigger profit. We were seated on a 8 seater table with 3 other couples, so hardly a good start to a romantic evening. the food was good, but the roast duck was disappointing.

Nope - time to be brow-beaten into ordering ASAP. TIME TIME TIME. No Time To Spare!Starters of poor spring rolls and mediocre soft-shell crab were forgiven by lovely crispy aromatic duck pancakes, but nothing that we couldn't get at somewhere more civilised. Pancakes gone and we were left with braised aubergine, rice and veg that looked like regular canteen schlop. Not the appetising far east delicacies I felt promised by such a high Yelp score.As well as the hurried, slapdash and loud atmosphere, another Four Seasons classic is the random bill at the end, with no breakdown of costs, just Chinese scribbles. Beware that you optional service charge has already been added to this without warning.There are some plus points. It's cheap. The full-time orange slices are amazingly juicy and sweet. And best of all, the table changes when you move from starter to main and mains to bill are a work of art. Two wait-staff in unison will transform your table in seconds like a Ferrari Grand Prix team doing a tyre-change.",

I think it's a stretch to say it's the best in the world though. That honour would have to be reserved for a place in Beijing (you can never replicate something in another country perfectly).

Just across the street from the Bayswater tube stop, this Chinese restaurant gives out the roast duck aroma that you can smell from a block away. If you don't know restaurant's exact location, just look for the long lines outside the restaurant. Lines continue to form even on those cold London winter days. That tells you how seriously yummy the ducks are. If you go, order the roast duck, BBQ pork and a dish or two of stir fried vegetables and that's all you need. The ducks are roasted to perfection with a thin layer of crispy skin that I wish I could just skim off the skin and eat it like potatoes chips. The meat is still juicy and moist and it is served hot with the most addicting duck sauce that the chef saved from the ducks drippings. Drizzle the sauce over rice and you'll find yourself going back for seconds and thirds. Is a simple Chinese restaurant, but the food is authentic, very delicious and the price tag is modest. And like typical Chinese restaurants, the table service is spotty and you have to speak over all the noises when the restaurant is full. But I don't go there expecting Savoy's level of services, I go there because I love their roast ducks.",

The food is always nice - my favourites are the roast duck (obviously!), the Japanese tofu with enoki mushrooms, Cantonese sizzling beef and Chinese broccoli with prawn cakes. Mmm... The downside of a busy place is that service can be chaotic and you may have to wait a while for a table. Today was fairly pleasant as we didn't have to wait too long. In addition, while the staff wanted to move us to a smaller table to allow a larger group to sit down (which in my opinion, is just terribly efficient), they were polite and apologetic about it and it was no hardship to us. The manager also came along to (indirectly) compliment my coat, which did cause the rest of my group to question their own style sense!I like coming here because turnaround is quick, the food yummy and there is no fuss.",

Last time I tried to go to the Four Seasons I couldn't get in because there was an hour long wait to get in. Good sign. This time we were lucky and managed to snag a table almost immediately, despite a substantial line starting to develop. This place is famous for its roast duck so we immediately ordered that, along with some hot and sour soup, beef with green onions, sizzling prawns, and some fried rice. I ordered a Tsing Tao beer which I was delighted to have delivered to me in a can with one of those old school pull top tabs. Awesome. The soup came quickly enough and was hot and delicious. The entrees shortly followed and were also absolutely fantastic. Nice fresh vegetables, tender meat, flavorful prawns. The duck took a while and we had to ask where it was but the place was absolutely packed so I can't blame them for taking a little longer to bring their house special. All I have to say about their duck is this: Stop whatever you're doing, and go. Now. Their duck is like nothing I have ever had before. I'm not sure what they do with it, and frankly I don't care. I'm pretty sure there's some addictive substance or something involved because I just couldn't stop eating it. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy in the middle. Absolutely perfect. The service was quick and a bit stilted but as I said, they were jam packed. They did well, all things considered. A truly impressive experience, one which I will be repeating many, many times.",

It is not the place where you take a timid, fragile just got to know her girl on a first date because she will be traumatised, shocked and won't eat anything, but with a group of experienced foodie friends who have been abroad at least once in a life, a good Sunday lunch experience.",

The restaurant is small with mostly 8 person round tables, so it's also jammed packed. They have all the BBQ'd ducks in the front window and watching them debone a duck is amazing - I'm talking 30 seconds start to finish with a huge cleaver. It's worth the price of admission. The food is also excellent, albeit with spotty service that requires you to be a bit more engaged in making things happen. Don't expect a friendly welcome and how do you do - it's all business with a 'you ready to order', but that's what makes it fun. Oh yeah, don't expect a quiet dinner for two - it's better for a larger group that's in the mood for fun. As for recommendations, you can't come to a place that can filet an entire duck in seconds without having any. It's worth it. I also love the crispy pork belly and the spare ribs are great. I also enjoyed the bok choy and the hot and sour soup with a bit of English flair - peas and tiny shrimp. Overall, everything looks good here and I look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "One has to travel outside of London's touristy Chinatown district to get decent Chinese food. I did so with my hunt for decent barbecued meats and saw good Yelp reviews here.It gets 4 stars bc:- it's claim to fame, their roast meat special (roast pork, pork w fried skin and roast duck) combo is to not too shabby.- I didn't experience Asian on Asian discrimination, which happens very often. I actually spoke to them in Cantonese to try this and was treated ok-well, and they even took time to say goodbye to me and didn't try to rush me when I was there alone, hogging up a table by myself on a Sunday around 1pm. (A busy time)- they try to proactively manage the crowds and try their best to fairly seat everyone based on when they come in.- fast service.- easy to get to, located on the Central line, one stop east of Nottinghill GateI have a mixed view to their claim to fame. Their roast duck is not the most banging thing I have ever eaten. Far from that, it is average. The skin was also not the greatest, I don't really eat skin too much but did it here to give an accurate feedback. However, their roast pork is banging! The sauce they serve on the barbecued meats is on the sweet side, but goes very well with this assortment.They do offer you a side of chili oil which is surprisingly also on the sweet side,but I actually found it to be very nice and dashed that on my entire dish.I can't rate the other foods,but why try anything else than this place's name to fame?Note: Everything is relative, so I'm not going to rate this based on other food I've had say in HK or other countries. But to date the best duck I have ever had is actually located in Philadelphia, PA called \"Sang Kee Duck House\". They have locations near the University of PA and Chinatown.",

The meat here is moist and delicious and not overly fatty at all. I've had my fair share of duck around the world and Four Seasons is by far the best that I've ever had. \u00a0I'm not sure if they made a deal with the Devil to make it taste so good, but whatever they did I'm not complaining.My favorite dish here is the boneless roast duck over boiled egg noodles with their yummy duck sauce/drippings. My second favorite is their salt & pepper pork chops and lastly their sliced roast pork with a delicious layer of crackling on the outside. \u00a0I've only scratched the surface of their menu, but I intend to come back here every time I'm in town. It's definitely worth a try if you love duck and are in the London area!On a side note, to the reviewers that complain about service, you've obviously never been to many authentic Asian restaurants. I've been here eight times so far and they've always been courteous and attentive, even when super busy. No the service won't leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside, but that's really not how it works in Asian culture. Service is usually quick and straight to the point and what some may consider curt is really just the norm. Please get your head out of your arse and do us all a favor by not taking up a seat at this wonderful restaurant.",

Word got around with the velocity of a lightning bolt to my colleagues about this place in Chinatown, and the results were tantalizing. We ordered the roast duck main dish, along with some mysterious pink shriveled-up morsels of beef. The Panda Express-look threw me off however, as these little treats hit my taste buds with fast oral appreciation and a smile. As well, the duck slipped with slight trepidation between my chopsticks initially, but its slightly salty juices made me at ease once it arrived at its destination. In addition, the cooked 'shrooms with peanut bits and saucy asparagus made me smile, knowing that a *relatively* healthy meal was being consumed. For any of you staying away from carbs, you would be proud. Don't hate on me, I work in I.T!The only slightly down mark was that it took a huge effort to gain the waitresses' attention on a couple of occasions. But that did not deter me from savoring some delicious Daffy with his friends, green sprouts and, *ignorance alert* small Chinese tortilla.",

    "text": "Reading all the positive reviews, I had set my hopes high for this place. There are quite a few asian restaurants on Queensway, which is usually a good thing (Brick Lane being a notable exception). I got there around 6:30 on a Wednesday, and the place was about half full. The clientele was about evenly split between Asians and tourists (with possibly some overlap between the two groups). I was quickly seated at a table right next to the door. I hate being next to the door especially if there are people waiting for a table, but since there were plenty of free tables, I thought it wouldn't be a problem.The duck gets prepared in the front next to the door, mostly so that people could see it from the street. It's clearly their specialty. However, the menu is huge, so no worries if duck is not your thing.I was thinking of getting the sliced duck, and asked the waitress whether it came with rice. The exchange went almost verbatim like this: -Excuse me, may I ask you a question about the sliced duck dish?-WHAT? WHAT QUESTION?-Does it come with rice?-NO RICE! RICE? ORDER SEPARATE!Yeah, I put her responses in caps for a reason. She *was* yelling.I decided to get the fish ball soup and sliced pork with fried noodles, partly because I'm cheap and partly to spite the rude waitress. The fish ball soup lacked any flavor and the fish balls were rubbery. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size of the sliced pork noodles, made me feel at home in the US for once. However, despite what one of the reviewers said, the noodles were literally swimming in grease. I've had my fair share of cheap greasy Chinese food, but this was beyond anything I'd ever seen. Even with all the grease, the flavor was lacking, and it was at best average.After asking for the check, I noticed a note on the wall saying that there is a \u00a310 credit card minimum, Also, if you have a swipe card (basically any American credit card) they require a passport or a drivers license. My order was supposed to come out to \u00a39, but it looks like they added a service charge, or maybe they charged for the glass of tap water--no way to tell b/c the bill was all handwritten in chinese characters.By the time I was leaving the restaurant all tables were full, and the line started to build up, so plan to come early if you don't want to wait for a table.Perhaps the duck is as good as people say. As for the rest of the menu, it's subpar, and be ready for some rude service.",

However, in contrast, the service in this place is terrible, the staff make no qualms in letting you know that once you have finished your food (in my case it is always the duck), they want you out.

The duck is out of this world.As for the d\u00e9cor, there is nothing special inside, just tables and chairs.

I had a lot of duck growing up as my dad once had a shop on the edge on Chinatown, and I had it for lunch many a time, so I know what a good duck is. Thumbs up, 10 out of 10, go Four Seasons. My advice would be to go in a large group so that the staff do not give you looks to hurry you out.",

    "text": "This is extremely important before I provide my review. \u00a0I want you to order the correct duck. \u00a0Order the Cantonese Roast Duck. \u00a0NOT the Aromatic Crispy Duck. \u00a0The Aromatic Crispy Duck does not exist in the Chinese world and it is a westernised deep fried duck like anything else that Westerners love to eat. \u00a0I see a lot of people ordering the wrong version of the duck. \u00a0The pictures that I have posted here are the ones you want to order. \u00a0Not the one which looks crispy / deep fried. \u00a0Continue...If you are ever in need of a juicy, fatty and flavourful Cantonese roast duck, this is the only place to go. \u00a0I probably have been to Chinese restaurants around the world and the roast duck here is still world class and best. \u00a0I want to say it is only my opinion but I think a few others say so too. \u00a0I haven't tried most of the Chinese food as most of the time I am here, I am just after the famous duck. \u00a0Order half of it with a steamed rice. \u00a0Hell, just order the whole duck! \u00a0The sweet and salty soya sauce gravy goes along with it really well. \u00a0You need the steamed rice to cut through the fat. \u00a0You can order it with bones like how the Chinese likes it or deboned. \u00a0Although that said, I have been told off before during a peak time that I couldn't order it deboned as they won't have enough time. \u00a0When you arrive go straight in past the queue if there is one and put your name down on their list with the person packing or preparing the food at the front of the restaurant. \u00a0They will call you once they have a table for your party. \u00a0However, I just have a word of warning for those who are new to this place. \u00a0In most Asian countries, the restaurants lack customer service. \u00a0It is the same here. \u00a0Expect poor customer service with no smiles and rude head 'maitre d's who will take your order. \u00a0It depends on their mood you know. \u00a0They will only sit you once all your parties have arrived so make sure you get all your parties in before you ask for a table or you will get scolded. \u00a0They are the best you know. \u00a0If you don't like it, there is the door. \u00a0You may leave anytime. \u00a0It is not like they have no other customers waiting in line. \u00a0Lol. \u00a0That said, please look beyond the customer service for the food quality. \u00a0When I say it is the best, it is the very best. \u00a0It is also extremely good value. \u00a0Half whole duck for \u00a313.80 and whole duck for \u00a323.80. \u00a0Even if you go to the finest restaurant in London, they will be more expensive than these best ducks. \u00a0Go ahead, buy the whole duck, go home and indulge! \u00a0I urge you guys to come.",

I have been here for dinner a couple times now.There was a bit of a wait, but I expected this since we were a party of 5 people. They got us in as soon as they could.We started off with the crispy duck, which I must say, was excellent! The crispy duck is the reason why we come to this restaurant. It has great flavor, moist, and is crispy on the outside. The vegetables, wonton wrappers, and sauce that comes with it goes great with the crispy duck. We also started with the crispy wontons filled with fish. These were certainly interesting. They weren't really my thing because I didn't expect there to be fish in them, but they were interesting to try. For dinner, I got pork noodles. This was pretty good. The portions were very generous.I thought that all staff members were polite and nice, but the service was not so great. A couple of times we asked for more water and more wonton wrappers and never got them. We had to try and track down the servers. As far as price goes, it was fair for London. The restaurant was clean, but very crammed. The tables are very close together, so you have to move your chair whenever someone wants to get out. Overall, EXCELLENT crispy duck (highly recommend), fair prices, and nice staff but could have more attentive service.",

Unfortunately though it comes at ta cost of long waits (I avoided it but the next group had quite a long wait), inconsiderate service, and it's most definitely overpriced. But, since it's all about the food for me I can't not recommend Four Seasons.It's on a random street far outside of where you'd expect to find amazing Chinese food in London (or anywhere for that matter) and the peking duck is the real showstopper. The pancakes are not as good as the actual duck but they are no slouch...some of the best i've ever had outside of the finest restaurants in China. The fried rice and other dishes aren't why you go here so don't even try them. Go here for the duck and make sure you make your pancakes properly with a bit of sauce on the pancake, and one piece of each of the garnishes, the way they do it in China, to get the most out of each bite.#2 on my list for Peking Duck behind Made in China Restaurant at the Grand Hyatt Beijing.",

Why cannot meh? \u00a0But the duck at Four Seasons made me want to use words and lyrics that I reserve for pork belly. \u00a0I actually closed my eyes, I'm ashamed to say...for duck?? \u00a0But it is that good. \u00a0Four Seasons is crowded and the service brusque. \u00a0As I've said time and time before, ambience is entirely irrelevant if you came out for the food, because only the food matters. \u00a0And yes, Four Seasons could afford to be more of a pit and a dive, staffed by harridans and lepers and I'd still be a devotee.",

The duck was solidly done with the perfectly light pancakes and rich plum sauce to go with. I loved the mapo tofu as well -- adequately spicy and flavourful. The dumplings and spinach were some of the best I had in London. The reason why it's four and not five stars is really the service. I felt like they were inattentive to their customers, and they didn't even let us sit at our table till all five of us had arrived. Ambience is very casual and typical Chinese. Hence, not the place if you're looking for a posh Chinese experience. I'd definitely go back for my Chinese cravings!",

Service is fairly efficient and, also, friendlier than usual in this area. But, then, as a frequent visitor to Chinese restaurants, you don't expect too much in terms of courtesy.When I ate there I tried three different dishes, all mains (Don't order rice at any of these places, it's a rip off and will only keep from eating enough of the *real* food): Cooked chicken with ginger (on the bone!), a mix of three types of grilled meat, and king prawns. See my photos.Everything was okay, nothing was outstanding. But in all fairness, the prices were on the lower end of Gerrard Street. After all, this is tourist area. When I was there, most of the other visitors were Chinese (might still be tourists of course). The decor isn't much to write home about, and because it tends to be busy, it may not be the best place to linger when you're \u00a0a couple or a group. Drinks selection, as usual, is rudimentary. I would recommend Chinese tea over inflated alcoholic drinks like Tsing Tao. There are plenty of good pubs near Leicester Sqaure for a beer after the meal.",

Ordered the pineapple duck and was not disappointed. I know I wouldn't finish a half let alone a quarter Peking duck so I opted for this. Side of rice cost extra. About 2.50\u00a3 Not what I wanted to spend, but it was good none the less. I probably won't go back, but it was a decent meal.",

The stirred fried vegetable with chopped garlic was crispy and very delicious. \u00a0The only letdown was the ginger- onion Prawn. \u00a0It was salty and the prawn was pre-treated with Soda powder to make it crispy, which left an undesirable taste. \u00a0WE enjoyed our Dinner there and next time in town I would go there again.",

We also ordered a stir fry prawns with vegetables and a saut\u00e9ed spinach. The saut\u00e9 spinach was done with eggs and century egg! Haven't had that in a long time! What a interesting street with tons of options from all over the world.",

    "text": "I don't know why people keep referring to the Four Season as the best duck Cantonese or other. Clearly they have not eaten anywhere else because it is defenerly not the best duck ever as some say. About 15 years or so ago there was an article I think in the evening standard by one of the food critics stating that the best Cantonese duck in town was to be found at the Four Season. Well let me tell you that I ate duck at the Four Season for several years before anyone ever raved about \"The Duck\". And I stopped eating there several years ago as I found that the \"Famous Duck\" was not so good. Now I understand the whaho of every one but I can eat a better duck at Canton China Town. And it cost less. I am writing this review because as I said after several years of been a patron of FS today I returned to see if it was better. NO NO NO it was even worst than I remembered. And please do not talk about service here. There is none. In all do go there but I would lower my expectations if I were you unless you don't know your duck from a chicken",

We ordered a full duck sized portion for 3 people with pancakes and oh boy we were surprised that we finished it all. A friend of mine ordered the sweet and spicy soup - which was kind of mediocre on the verge of \"um what is this??\" It was alright, I wouldn't order that. The service was pretty poor. I mean we had to keep asking the waiter/waitress for certain things and they were really sloppy. When bringing our glasses of water, it dripped all over the table, and when they picked up our dishes, they were really messy.But if you don't mind the service, then this a good place to get good Chinese food.",
