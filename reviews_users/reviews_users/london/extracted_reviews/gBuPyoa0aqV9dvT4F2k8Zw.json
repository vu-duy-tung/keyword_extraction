    "text": "I happened to walk past Guerilla Burgers over the weekend shortly before lunch-time, so when the time came to decide where to eat, this was a no-brainer. What drew me to this place - besides the general hype all over the (paper and online) media - was the decor. I liked the drawings and colourful interior. (Why yes, I do judge a book by its cover. Why do you ask?) I opted for a Topless Burger Salad in a futile attempt to be healthy. For those who haven't been there, it's a salad with coucous and a burger patty on top. I don't think the burger was wonderful as they were a little on the dry side in spite of being medium rare. My friend opted for the Rodeo Burger. The bacon which topped the burger was amazing. Thick, and crispy. The best bacon I've ever eaten. Seriously. If they had a bacon sandwich/butty option, I'd probably go for that over the burger next time. We shared a serving of Smothered Fries. Based on the description (fries 'smothered' with cheddar cheese and veggie chilli), it sounded like a good bet, but I'd say it was average at best. I've had better chilli-smothered nachos served at bowling alleys, to be honest. So, if the fries weren't too great and the burger wasn't spectacular, why exactly am I giving this place four stars? Because of the service! The service was impeccable. The lady who showed us to our seats, and our waiter, Eric, were cheerful and perky beyond belief. It was such a refreshing change to receive such good - dare I say - American-style service. It made me happy on a day I had started off feeling a little like crap. And I'll take that over incredible food any day!",

    "text": "I don't ask for much with my burger - just a nicely cooked burger with some extra trimmings in a nicely decorated place. And on that score, Guerilla Burgers delivers. Maybe it was the summer sunshine, but the place definitely had a relaxed and cool vibe about it that reminded me of Cuban summers - not that I've ever been to Cuba. The waitress asked us how we liked our burgers - my medium burger turned out to have more pink in it than I would normally associate with a medium burger, but I was fine with that. Some people may not be. Also, if you like 'British' bacon with your burger, don't come here. The bacon was cooked American-stylee - ie fried to a dry lifeless flaky piece of meat. Terrible. My other main criticism with this (and other 'posh' burger joints) is the pricing - charging \u00a37 for a burger, and then \u00a33 for an additional portion of fries just seems ridiculous. But I seem to be alone in this. then again, maybe it's a small price to pay for a truly relaxing place to hang out in.",

Here's a clue: It's not at GBK. but the burgers at Guerilla are a pretty good place to start. Like most burger joints I've been to, everything else other than the burger is just window dressing. Starters a bit pointless, sides very run of the mill. Actually, neither were bad. The burger was good, although I should have asked for medium rare, as is often the case, the burger wasn't nearly as pink as I'd have liked. Even the crinkle cut chips weren't bad, and I hate crinkle cut chips (no, I don't know why). Things I liked? The service was excellent. Really excellent. The cocktails were good too. Things I didn't like? My pickle wasn't sliced and wouldn't go in my burger. And the rose wine is pretty awful. The sugary Ribena-esque stuff that I avoid like the plague. But dinner for under a tenner in Marylebone is a rare thing. My hunt for the perfect burger isn't over, but I'd be more than happy to come back here.",

I am always a fan of hard shakes and this place offers them and at a reasonable price-what's not to love?? I tried a couple of varieties, both excellent, and there was loads of tasty comfort food options on the menu, which I would definitely have enjoyed had I not over indulged earlier in the day. The service was what really set burgers and cocktails apart, obviously it sometimes takes just one person having a good or bad day to affect the service you receive however here not only did our waitress genuinely seem to take pleasure in taking our orders and bringing us food, but also all other staff that I interacted with seemed to share the joy. I saw nothing to suggest this isn't the usual way things are around here and for this reason I am sure I will be back when I need somewhere relaxed to have some naughty snacks and shakes, especially the next time I have visitors from abroad who want to eat somewhere central without the usual central prices",

    "text": "As 'dedicated' burger restaurants go, Guerilla Burgers seems a bit more laid-back and scaled-down than most others. This is no bad thing -- who says you need to get all sniffy to enjoy a well-made burger? The decor and atmosphere is deliberately 'revolutionary' -- I'm not sure why, but I don't see why not either. It gives the place a bit of a buzz, but an unpretentious one. Our excellent waitress matched this perfectly, always smiling and rarely standing still. The food was not spectacular, but decent enough nonetheless. My burger was satisfyingly put together, with a medium-cooked beef patty and decent bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato in an interesting but hardy toasted bun. It wasn't huge, but it wasn't expensive either -- you definitely get what you pay for. An accompaniment of crinkly chips was excellently retro, if somewhat unauthentic. The appetisers were OK (if somewhat forgettable), but the shared puddings of chocolaty stuff (I wasn't really paying attention by this point) were pretty good. We left rather stuffed. There was one small hiccup at the end of our visit, where we were charged for several side-orders that we had not received. However this was quickly resolved. All in all, I would recommend Guerilla Burgers for those looking for a well-executed but unpretentious burger.",

    "text": "Having not yet been to Byron to compare I can only review this place based on the night I had with a bunch of other Qypers as part of the Meat Up event this week. So, where to start - Location is OK if you want to torture yourself by shopping on Oxford Street I guess, it's certainly pretty central. The \"Revolution\" theme - \"Power to the Patty\" and all that, makes for a fun environment, but it's hardly something to take seriously - I always find these appropriations forced to the limit - what is so revolutionary about a burger? Anyhow, I liked the vibe of the place, our waitress was a ball of energy (in a good way) and kept our margaritas topped up and was always smiling. She was bopping along to the music as I came back from the bathroom and confessed that I had been dancing under the hand dryer to the previous song. 2 minutes later she came over and had put the same song on again - that is service right there..! Personally I didn't think the music was too loud, it was certainly noticeable but this isn't a fine dining experience. The food was also enjoyable, I liked the tarragon dip with the chicken nuggets and the nachos were ok. I had the Cobb burger, with blue cheese, bacon and avocado and it was very tasty - cooked well enough to be juicy and in a nice brown bun. The sweet potato fries were a winner for me, but I'm a sweet potato freak so it would be hard to destroy them. I'm not sure about the metal bowl things the burgers were served in but it didn't really detract from the experience. I didn't think I could manage dessert either but the creamy Oreo cookie thing and the brownie were both devoured quite quickly in the end, proving the theory that regardless how much meat you eat, you can still manage some chocolate. I enjoyed it, it is a fun place for a very reasonably priced meal. Thanks to Alex for organising it!",

The location is nice, a good corner spot with plenty of natural light and breeze. However, I couldn't blame not hearing my fellow guests on the traffiic outside, but on the exceedingly loud music inside - annoyningly loud tunes drowned out conversation. We tried 2 starters and burger apiece. The chicken nuggets were serviceable, with a nice Russian tarragon sauce, but as an ex-pat who grew up on nachos, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT MAKE NACHOS IF YOU ARE NOT SURE HOW TO MAKE THEM. Our bowl of strange chips with baked on cheese and 'sour cream' (I'm sorry, I will never get used to your sour cream) and guac was painful at best. My cobb burger was well put together, but as I got turkey it was exceedingly dry. I should have gotten beef, my partner seemed to like his. I will giive it an extra star for two things - the cookies and cream milkshake was fabulous, and our server was brilliant in keeping up with us. She definately added a star for me.",

    "text": "I went along on day one of Guerilla Burgers' opening. The decor and humour on the walls and on the menu made me smile. From the graphic on the awning to the 'apps' section of the menu (appetizers did exist before the iPhone you know). Everything was spot on, the service was incredibly good and I felt happy in there, which considering moaning is my natural default is pretty darn good. The chilli bowl and chips was a winter warming alternative to minestrone soup with the quality to out-do tex-mex establishments. The cookies n' cream milkshake was a risk as I don't actually like real cream. The gamble paid off, because it was excellent. This excellence also applies to the fish tacos which waves the flag for the London fresh-mex style scene doing the rounds. The only slight disappointment came ironically from the burgers. My veggie mate said his veggie burger looks great but wasn't quite there with the spiciness or taste. However, it's not enough for me to knock off a star from my experience as his plate was spotless. As I got the bill a business card sticker arrived: a suggestion to stick it somewhere in a guerilla marketing tactic. markstone.posterous.com/\u2026  However, in the guerilla warfare that is the posh burger battle of London, I'm sure Che Guevara would pop by here for refuelling if he finds himself in the area...",

    "text": "Oh dear. We're not off to a good start. Guerilla Burgers opened this week, and we popped in for an evening burger on their second night. You can still smell the paint on the walls and it's nestled on James St where Tootsie's used to be: a culinary black hole of touristic medicocrity. So keeping its youth, inexperience and location in mind, let's see how they did. Despite a friend being able to order a medium/rare burger earlier in the day (and enjoying it too), I was denied the same patty treatment and proffered the 'health and safety' excuse. Irritating. Of course when they did show up (roughly 25 minutes later), they were hideously, unforgivably overcooked. Literally crunchy on the outside of the patty. Arid in texture despite pouring all the sauce I had to hand. This is a heinous crime when your raison d'etre is making burgers, and a hefty proportion of your overlong menu is given over to a poorly written quasi-diatribe on what makes 'the perfect burger'. PS: it's not burning it. The burger itself is served in a metal dish (the kind you would typically get a curry served in) with the condiments on the side. The buns were neatly toasted, but my companion simply stated through dried-out lips \"I could have cleaned my bath with that burger\". It doesn't stop there, they serve up crinkle cut chips. Like the ones out of the freezer you used to get round your best mate's house when you were nine years old. And they haven't changed. The fish tacos are also a country mile away from what fish tacos should be. They're marinaded salmon, with no coating and shop-bought tzatziki in there too. And were cold. There are some enormous menu issues going on here. It's too long and unfocused and the copywriter needs to start again. Check out the PDF on the site and witness the layout issues and bizarre menu choices (the LA burger has cottage cheese in it, burger sauce is called 'Russian Tarragon Dressing', sliders are called skaters for some incomprehensible reason, I could go on). Saving graces? Well the staff were very much full of first-week perk, which would have made us feel guilty about complaining about the food. They were trying really hard, and I can't blame them for what came out of the kitchen, although arguably a quality control process should be implemented to stop overcooked meat going out. If they sort out the menu and do some proper testing I might give it another go, but when you've got Byron within schlepping distance, then I can't think of a good reason to go here. The thing is, it won't really matter if the food doesn't get any better. James Street serves the post-Selfridges tourist crowd, and it will make no difference to them if whingy blogger types like me continue to opine Byron's simple genius over Guerilla Burgers.",

    "text": "We decided to have an early dinner here today as the menu was simple and looked interesting. I had the American, my friends had the BLT, Cobb and the New Yorico hot dog. We also added side orders of sweet potato fries and smothered fries. You get complimentary tap water in a jug, and a tray of condiments - ketchup, mustard, mayo, tabasco, chilli flakes, salt, and pepper.The burgers came with a small metal cup of relish (similar to the ones they use at Friday's for the JD sauce for the steaks) and half a gherkin on the side. The burgers are in between a GBK and McD's. The menu says they are done medium, and should be a little pink on the inside. However, because the patties aren't very thick, they were almost completely well done, with just the tiniest hint of pink. Nevertheless, they were still juicy enough to be tasty. The buns were nice and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and they were seeded. I couldn't really taste the bacon in the burger, but I enjoyed the patty, cheese and mushrooms, with freshly cut onions and lettuce, along with healthy lashings of tabasco sauce. I also cut the gherkin up into chunks and added them to the burger.The smothered fries were disappointing, as the fries weren't very crispy, and the cheese had congealed and the vegetarian chilli had clung to it instead of seeping into the fries. The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, were delicious. They were sweet and crispy and I thoroughly enjoyed them.The meal for 4 of us, 3 burgers, a hot dog, 2 sides, and 4 drinks, came up to \u00a345, which I felt was reasonable. Worth going to if you're in the area and want a reasonably quick and reasonably priced meal.",

Like, I needed tequila afterwards to cut the taste!My Ranch(?) burger was pretty good, and the boozy milkshake I had was awesome, least I think it was, as it was strong enough that I dont really remember. *facepalm*Service was good, and they didnt charge us for the salt solution, I mean, caramel milkshake.Would definitely come back herel.",

Milk shakes were great, moreish and the Cookies and cream one had the perfect amount of Oreos. Great for groups or a chilled casual dinner.",

Byron is the benchmark in this space, and any burger place that serves a better burger is fine by me.We ordered Crinkly Fries, Onion Rings and the Matador and Sloppy Joe Burgers. The sides were average at best. Soggy onion rings and kebab shop fries. The burgers tasted ok, the Sloppy Joe being the tastiest. However they both looked pretty sad at best - like something that had potential while growing up but has been hugely neglected.I am not a burger snob, and in a pub (at pub prices) I would accept this. However, the difference between this meal and the Wetherspoon Burger Deal is just not enough.",

I walked pass Burgers & Cocktails after the gym thinking... well... why not. In the back of my head I was expecting a giant greasy burger that would put me into a food coma half way through and leave the rest of my saturday completely useless.BUT.When my food came I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Good Day Sunshine. For once the size of the burger was JUST RIGHT! I could pick up the entire burger and take a full bite with all the ingredients in it (unlike most places where I basically have to eat each layer of the burger on its own with fork and knife). The bun was light and freshly toasted, my sunny side up egg was slightly crispy on side the white and the yolk was just runny enough to coat the entire patty as I press down to pick up the burger. The bacon was perfectly crispy and the patty was juicy, fluffy and not over seasoned. I haven't been this satisfied with a burger for a long time. It was fresh and light as oppose to overly fatty and dense with overwhelming flavor that puts you in a deep coma. I would definitely go back for seconds and probably try their hot dogs and shakes next time!",

We weren't fussy (having enjoyed two hours of happy hour nearby!) but we were turned away from the surprisingly small nando's over the road because they'd 'stopped cooking as much food after 9pm' (or some similarly ridiculous explanation).A couple of things let this place down for me. Firstly they didn't have any shakes, and the hard shakes on the menu sounded lush! The main thing though was the burger. I went for the special 'The French' burger with caramelised onion, blue cheese and pear, three very distinctive tasting ingredients. But it came out tasting of nothing at all. The cooked-past-my-liking patty I could handle, but it was as if the toppings had bizarrely cancelled each other out. If you're going to put 'Burgers' in your name, they'd better have a lot more flavour than this!The main thing that saved the experience though was the amazingly friendly service. Our large (loud) group was welcomed in an hour before closing (by a waiter with awesome dreads) and our waitress was just the right balance of chatty but efficient. They were fine with some of the tweaks my mates asked for and she remembered roughly who ordered what when the food came out - always a thoughtful touch.The fun, friendly service (and sweet potato fries!) means I'd probably come back if I was with a big group seeking sustenance again. The prices are also so reasonable for the central location that one of my mates was passed the card machine to pay for him and his wife, and had to check they were charging him for two people! Hopefully next time I'll get to try the shakes too...",

Doors were wide openned, music in the air and it felt like it was waiting for us to enter, sit and have a great meal. And What meal ! I rarely like Burgers, but when I find a great one, i appreciate it and so did I. Sure that my money was not waisted !WHAT I LOVEDthe atmosphere ! Everything seams to be done so you just feel like home somehow. Music is great, there is sound everywhere but not noise (in the restaurant, they can't control what happens in the street ^^) and there is that really joyful mood surrounding us ! Loved it !ANY CRITICS ?I'm no fan of very loud music, and even if I loved the music played that day I would have prefered it to be a bit lower, but that is just me and my ears ^^TO AVOID :Sit near the openned doors, the sound of the street mixed with music is not that great... plus some guys bothered us a bit while I was with my friend :( but that has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, it's just a tip ^^",

As the name would suggest the place specialises in Burgers and Cocktails and it is part of the Giraffe group of restaurants.The food was good but it wasn't especially clear on the menu what actually came with the burgers, I really hate it when restaurants do that. By that stage of the day I was cocktailed out so only drank beer. Our server was also really helpful, attentive and flexible especially when we added a couple of stragglers to our table. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but I will bear it in mind next time I'm in the area.",

I was there during the week when the tourists who import their cars from dubai etc are around so i had a fabulous american burger gazing longingly at cars out of my price range lol.Hubby loved their peanut butter milkshake. We had the american which has bacon cheese onions and mushrooms on the burger. We paid for some sides which were a let down the chips didnt seem to be fresh but frozen crinkle chips and the onion ring was oozing oil and when you bit it the whole onion came out - very disappointing. The brownie dessert was very nice. If they could improve on the side dishes i reckon this would be a great place to eat.",

    "text": "From it's trendy decor to it's unique selection of reasonably priced burgers, Guerilla is a solid option for those wishing to upgrade from the run of the mill McDonalds and Burger King chains that line the streets of central London. Conveniently located around the corner from the Bond Street Tube Stop, Guerilla Burgers offers a wide selection of beef, turkey and vegetarian burgers that come with a variety of unique toppings ranging from Chili Peppers to Avocado. Complemented by their truly spectacular sweet potato fries, an outing at Guerilla makes for a good food option before exploring some of the nearby bar and club options. While it's relatively easy to be in and out without dropping much more than a tener, portions are a bit on the small side, so be sure to order large orders of sides. For those not wanting a burger, salads are quite large and worth the cost. Overall, Guerilla is a good non-chain burger option that's affordably priced, and the atmosphere makes for a good evening.",

    "text": "Once upon a time I saw this place as I was walking toward Tommi's, and I thought that it sounded like an interesting name, but it would probably be a place I'd never go to as I couldn't imagine it would be good. Fast forward to a weekend when there were seven of us drinking heavily, and then deciding we needed a place for dinner. Seven? On a Saturday night in Central London with no booking? Good luck!Luckily, we were REALLY close to here, so we stopped in and asked how long of a wait it would be for seven people. They said, \"Oh we have a table for you right now\". Score. Unfortunately, everyone else was still at the bar drinking, but they held the table for us to run back and settle the bill and come back. So you gotta get a bonus star for a) having a table and b) holding it for us on a busy Saturday night.They have a nice cocktail selection, and they also provide boozy milkshakes. Luckily, they aren't the crappy British style milkshakes, but proper American milkshakes with ice cream. Add some booze and you're in heaven. I also had an espresso martini and it was incredibly tasty with fresh made espresso poured right in. You could definitely taste the coffee. Delicious!For food I had the green chili burger and split an order of Sloppy Joe fries and a mac and cheese wheel with the other half. The fries were great, and while they were in no shape or form covered with sloppy joe filling, they were some of the better chili fries I've had in London. The chili was full of flavor. The mac and cheese wheel was a deep fried mac and cheese served with marinara. American heaven. The burger was also much more tasty than I imagine for a place like this, and I had a bite of the chicken satay burger and was pleasantly impressed.All in all, this place exceeded all my expectations with surprisingly tasty food and really friendly service. I even managed to unknowingly do a magic trick when I made the menu disappear (by managing to drop it behind the booth seating against the wall as there is a tiny crack just big enough to slide a menu into. WHOOPS!)I don't know if I'll go out of the way to come back, but if we have a large group that needs some drunken sustenance and we're in the area, it's definitely a great place.",

It seemed a nice place, relaxed atmosphere, beaches on the walls, a classic american diner with a caribbean setting. Good for going out with a friend, or even a group as the place is pretty big, don't go there for a first date UNLESS you know exactly what are you doing!How was it? Awesome! The staff is super-friendly and very relaxed, we ordered 2 burgers with fries as side and 2 beers (PS: they have red stripe! not easy to find around here!)..Now I have a very small, very important question: what's your problem with burgers, british people!?! Why for god sake are you giving me everything separated, I mean, I choose this burger among the others, therefore I DO want what it's written on, the fact that I have to compose it by myself seems so stupid!Anyway...Everything was good, not the absolute top quality I-want-to-cry-because-I-want-another-one but a pretty good burger indeed! Honorable mention to the onion rings: these things here are damn good! Kudos! The only drawback: I couldn't choose the cooking level of my meat... Uff... I will create a party, reach the parliament, become prime minister and I WILL CHANGE this thing.Every man should be able to decide their own cooking level!! Vive la Revolution!",

Not one to see a milkshake and deny herself, she orders the chocolate milkshake (described as 'yum') and I ordered the 'low carb beer'. - All satisfied. As always our eyes are bigger than our mouths and we order big fries, coleslaw and onion rings to go with our veggie burgers.

That now out of the way, Guerilla Burgers burger made me happy in a way that I can't quite explain. It wasn't mind-blowingly delicious, but sitting around a table with some of my favourite people in London, noshing on sweet potato fries and onion rings, sucking down our cokes over ice, passing pickles, sampling sauces... it just felt so comfortable. So normal. Like a backyard BBQ. And it tasted exactly like that too. Not stunning, just really really good, in a way that goes far beyond the food.There were some misses - notably the nachitos, the fish finger sando and the desserts (not deserts, to clarify). However the absolute must-order onion rings, sweet potato AND crinkle cut fries as well as the plain ol' beef cheeseburgers were spot on. I mean right on. As in, like, totally awesome, dude. Speaking of, like, totally awesome, the service was beyond stellar and our waiter was perhaps the friendliest, quickest, most efficient and just genuinely fantastic server I've had in London in a loooooong time. Longer even than I usually have to wait for my check. We didn't get his name, but Mr, Canada, we were all a-boat you.",
