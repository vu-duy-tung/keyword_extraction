    "text": "It sells very nice beer (Sierra Nevada on tap, plus London Pride from the cask). This is a good thing. It also sells a wide variety of cider, if you like the stuff, which (after a nasty experience when I was younger) I don't. Being in a fairly quiet area, there's plenty of space in the summer to move out on the street and enjoy yourself. This is good too; and it's a nice place to sit out and people watch. There's a certain character to the place, with amusing and enjoyable comments pasted on the wall and on the bar. However, the bar staff are glacially slow to serve - generally, at busy times, there's only one person on, with someone else faffing about polishing glasses. The service is less than appalling. And if you order a pie for lunch (as I did once), don't be surprised if it takes 45 minutes to appear - even when there are only seven people in the pub. The music appears to be a Nathan Barleyesque character on the decks during the evening. The music's anything but Well Jackson, and frankly just serves to annoy. And sadly, the clientele (mostly BBC and meeja-types) are the kinds of people that you really want to punch. Loud, unpleasant, annoying. Except when my team's in, in which case we're lovely. So the plan is: yes, go there. But give the money to someone else, and make them waste hours of their lives queueing at the bar; and try to avoid most of the clientele and their meeja ways.",

We accidentally came across this place after a long day at work and have been addicted since. Great Cider bar, varying from strong 8.4% to the usual apple and pear ciders which are great.. I would suggest going early as it can get quite packed.. lots of BBC employees - great drinks at great prices!!",

There is a plethora of ciders on the menu including the dangerous Old Rosie which will lure you in like a pirate hooker and then violate you when you have more than a coupple of pints. At 8.5% please drink responsibly. If that doesn't tickle your fancy there are another 15+ ciders available including the more mainstream ones such as Kopperberg and Bulmers for the less adventurous. They also inform me that they do have a beer on tap... I didn't listen to what it was. At Christmas make this a priority because thier mulled/spiced cider is UN-REAL. At 4 nuggets for a half pint it's a little spenny, but totally worth it. The pub itself is awesome with great artwork and posters throughout. There's also a solid food menu. The fish finger sandwich could rival that of the Sluaghtered Lamb in Clerkenwell. That will set you back about 6 nuggets. One of my favouritest pubs in London town. It should be yours too. Sexy Rob",

Getting drunk on cider in a nice place pretty much ticks all the boxes on my alcohol over indulgence wish list. Which is why I enjoyed the green man so much (at least i think thats where i was!!)As you walk in and admire the kooky surroundings and bob your head rhythimically to the funky party tunes massaging your ears at just the right volume you might be mistaken for thinking you have wandered into an establishment in Hoxton. You then realise that people are smiling and having fun rather than trying to look cool -which in my book is pretty cool.Next up you approach the bar and see a ridiculous array of ciders at your disposal \u00a0and you realise you have entered pub heaven. Being a fan of WWF wrestling i drank pints of Hogans which has a distinct earthy farmy taste and exactly what i imagine the hulk himself would sup, however there are about a million others so take your pick.This is yet another of \"Noho's\" hidden gems.NB: you know a place is good when you request REO Speedwagon and a 20 something uber cool dj looks at you like a proud father and simply says YESSSSSSSS!!.",

It's not that strong at 4.5% but it does have the knack of turning the drinker into a massive jerk! That said, if you follow the guidelines you'll be fine and your friendships will remain intact!The only things i didn't like about this place were the refusal to serve Jager bombs because \"they're chavvy\". Lest ye forget young barman that Jager was invented and marketed metal heads and rock n roll types... they also taste better than tequila!At about half 10 the pub shut... not called last orders, just shut. I could understand if it was dead but the place was heaving, there was a girl at the bar wearing a banana on her head and the DJ was playing 80's power rock!Why would anyone want to stop that?The venue is also home to some very good live comedy and a tasty looking menu board... more investigation is required methinks!",

There were 12 ciders advertised but only actually 3 on offer during my visit, so even though the cider quality and choice is better than almost anywhere else, you may be slightly disappointed when they don't have your selection. The throughfare to the side of the bar leading to the back, upstairs and the toilets is liable to get blocked if a group takes the tables therewhich can be a pain.

Being in the London University are I think we can safely assume that it will be frequented by a younger and more contemporary crowd. The entertainment side is far more extensive because there are broader CD choices and free music papers which are usually seen in the East End bars rather than the West End.With fairly solid pub grub to soak up the (over) 7% strength of the ciders on offer, AT LEAST T6HE Green Man is a pub trying to do something different and - so far at least - succeeding.",

The rather bijou little bar proudly sports a choice of nine ciders on draught, fifteen bottled, and four in flagons, including the eponymously famous Green Man Special, which has to be drunk with care, as too many can lead to a sudden sensation that someone's turned up the gravity all of a sudden, and make the next morning something you really don't fancy being part of. However, there are plenty of choices, and a fine evening can be had exploring the menu, from the old country flat ciders through to their more modern fizzy counterparts. The staff are accommodating when it's quiet, but can turn surly when the place fills up and they find themselves busy, perhaps the one thing that keeps me from giving it the full five stars. There's also a rather nice room upstairs that can be booked for large groups and parties, and there's frequently DJ nights and music being played, albeit sometimes on the painfully trendy side.All in all, the Green Man is a pretty good pub to visit with friends, and it's somewhat out-of-the way location means it's nicely away from the main drag of Oxford and Regent Streets and TCR, while still being close enough for that bus home at the end of the night.",

The Bastard Burger is two patties and so I went for the BLT - Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato for those that didn't know. The burger came with a side of Hand-Cut fries and as you can see from the pic (ignore the blob of mayo on the side) - DAS IST SER GUT!The size of the burger was manageable, just too many chips. First, second and third bites went in quickly. I was hungry and lunch time is limited. What came through straight away was the crisp of the bacon with the crunch of the lettuce. Haven't had lettuce in a burger like that since, well the whopper but you know what I mean. A lot of these new burger places don't come with lettuce. The patty itself was very juicy and the bun complimented and supported the juices. Not too dry and not ruined either, the bun held all contents in and I wasn't making a mess of my \u00a3xxx shirt. The cheese was American and that too was very nice. Not overcomplicated or extra fancy to take away or confuse the taste buds.",

Good for crowds though, there was a good atmosphere, vibe, decor etc. They have burger offers on weds and Thursday so we had a decent meal for \u00a37 each-bargain! Would return but it would depend on the occasion. Probably better for cider drinkers than me.",

Still, the place I will go for those after work drinks :)",

    "text": "A bit quiet during the day on Saturday, it's a nice place to retreat from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. If you like ciders, this is the place for you. Try The Green Man, which is their signature cider! They also have a varied offering of wines and beers so everyone will be happy. We popped in for a Sunday roast which was pretty good and ok value considering you're in Central London. The staff was nice and the atmosphere was very calm. A great place for a mid afternoon catchup over a few drinks. I haven't been there on a weeknight or even a weekend night so not sure if the vibe changes then.Worth a stop if you are in the area and looking for a nice pub to have a drink in.",

    "text": "Rarely do I find the opportunity to wield the hammer of Yelp for social good. But after last night, I feel compelled--nay, inspired--to do so. The Green Man looks pleasant from the outside. It even looks quite pleasant on the inside. Interact with the xenophobic, vindictive staff, though, and this veneer of hospitality begins to fall apart. Last night, I wandered into The Green Man with a few friends. The first approached the bar and ordered the house cider (which looks a lot like urine, by the way...). I followed suit and was asked for an ID. This is not unusual: as a youthful-looking 21-year-old, I have probably been ID'd in a third of the London establishments I've entered over the past two months. I handed the homely bartender my US driver's license, which she scrutinized for about thirty seconds before handing it back to me. Apparently it was 'very likely fake' and she had no ability to determine its authenticity. I handed over two other IDs showing the same birthday to no effect. She deemed it more plausible that I had faked multiple forms of ID than that I wasn't 18. Funny, because another friend had just received a beer with their own license from the same state as mine. A double standard, eh? I noted this to the bartender, who shrugged. Two other friends went back for a second drink, were ID'd this time, and were denied service by the same bartender who had given them their first beverage. If it smells fishy, it's because it was, indeed, fishy. As a law-abiding, jolly American citizen, it hurt to be denied service at a local pub. Apparently I was just not good enough. Undeterred, we politely stated our intention to leave and moved on to another pub a block away--The Yorkshire Grey--and had a fantastic end to a very demeaning night. If you care about common human decency and yearn for a day when all patrons will be treated equally, regardless of appearance or nationality, avoid this lackluster pub in favor of one of the other friendly outposts in the area. You'll be glad you did.",

We got there fairly early and managed to secure a lovely table in the corner. The place did fill up, though ...It seemed like a crime not to try one of their ciders, but two of us are fans of rose wine when the sun comes out - I think they even had a choice. Two of the guys had a selection of ciders and were in their element.It's nice to discover a \"new\" pub so close to Soho and I will definitely come again.",
