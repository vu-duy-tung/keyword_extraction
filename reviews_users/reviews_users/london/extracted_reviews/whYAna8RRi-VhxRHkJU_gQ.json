    "text": "I spent 7 weeks in London about 5 years ago and lived nearby on Lexham Gardens. This was my absolute favorite neighborhood spot and I went there at least 1-2 times per week. When I booked my flight a few months ago to visit London again for vacation last week, all I could think of was getting my hands on their roasted vegetable and goat cheese sandwich. I didn't remember the name of the cafe but I knew it was by the Gloucester tube stop and I just prayed that A) it was still open and B) that they still made those sandwiches. They did.Dear god do I love that sandwich, right off the hot press, with slightly warmed/gooey goat cheese and roasted vegetables...mmm. Prices are pretty darn good (couldn't find a cheaper double espresso even up in Belsize Park) and the rest of my party all really enjoyed their pizzas (personal size with 4 toppings for only 5 pounds) and sandwiches. It's a cute spot with great prices and food. I highly recommend it and wish there was one in NYC!",

It's a pretty typical deli, they have sandwichy things, I'm a big quiche fan, \u00a0pasta things, etc. \u00a0 I think if it was only open in the day I'd be lukewarm on it, but the fact that you can go there... I think until 2 or 3am gives them some extra stars.. It's also a stop for the tube workers that are doing overnight shifts so I'm guessing that's how they keep their business in the wee hours, but there's still the die-hards that stumble down Gloucester road in search of late night munchies.",

Right around the corner from the hotel, it was a take away godsend after a long day of seeing London's many sights. \u00a0We particularly liked their quiche, both the vegetable and the ham and cheese varieties were delicious. The Pizza Panini was tasty, as was the Spanakopita, a Greek dish with spinach and melted cheese inside folded over Filo bread. \u00a0We wished we had been able to try more of their desserts, as the apple strudel was quite good. I noticed they even serve milkshakes there.Everything we had was fresh, high-quality and reasonably priced, topped off with friendly service. \u00a0And hot - a bonus for microwave-challenged hotel visitors.

The individuals who work there are all right if you take more time than is required to eat - and are OK if you 'chill out' a bit. It's nice to sit around and people watch, either from the indoor or outside tables.Caffe Forum is also great for a casual lunch - you can either take one of their many pre-made sandwiches on the go with you, or you can enjoy there. In addition to the premade sandwiches, they also have a rotating selection of hot dishes.Definitely a local favourite!",

Breakfast: If you don't like mushrooms for breakfast (full english includes these) you can switch it for something you do like. If you start the day with a hot drink, you get a free croissant.Loved the spinach pie, the pizza is good, as is the lasagne. We had too little time to sample all they offer, because we kept ordering food we had before. It was so good!About the staff: they were simply brilliant. Had a lovely time, got lots of useful info and they had or made time for a chat. All in all, if you're in the neighbourhood: go here!",

English breakfast consisted of one egg, two sausages, two strips of bacon, ice cold baked beans, tomato, mushrooms and toast. Nothing was hot except my tea. The tea was delicious. I know a full English breakfast is supposed to be hot. As someone from London, I was sorely disappointed especially since I had someone with me from the States.Will not be dining at the Caffe Forum again. \u00a0area of London.

It's close to both the Gloucester tube station and several hotels like the Holiday Inn. This place can be quite busy during the morning rush but people tend to mow down and clear out. You won't find people indulging in a long leisurely breakfast. Most of the crowd seems like tourists and it seems a great place to run into Germans, French, and even the odd Canadian.I quite enjoyed their bacon, cheese, and tomato panini. The bacon tasted a little odd to my Canadian tastes (where we tend to cur our breakfast meats in equal measures of maple syrup and salt). But after my third panini (not in the same sitting) I found the different taste growing on me.Every coffee order comes with a croissant, which seems another bonus.",

I couldn't leave England without having a \"Big English Breakfast\". It was the typical Cafe setting and was a perfect end to a wonderful trip.A good last memory of England. Thank you Caffe Forum.",

Maybe it was the lack of attention in the kitchen with the angry bearded gentleman that brought the food. Whatever it was I think I've received food poisoning. my wife and I haven't stopped going to the toiletall day. Save your money, your time ,your health and go somewhere else.",

Took nearly 15 mins to get our drinks & coffee after we were served our food. Was so frustrated I ended up buying two water bottles to drink while we ate. The place is really small hard to find a table I must say. Very disorganized staff. If you decide to come here go for just coffee nothing complicated or else be prepared to wait a while to get everything you ordered. Overall I will not be coming back here. DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.",

    "text": "Thank goodness for this place! We had gotten out of a show at Royal Albert Hall kind of late, and were starving. Our timing was pretty bad at that point - everything was either closed, or closing up as we spotted them. I thought we were going to have to eat at the Burger King (blech) when we noticed this one little spot.Entering, the place was pretty packed with a large group of men playing chess - there were at least half a dozen boards set up around the dining room. We walked up to the counter to see what was on offer, and the friendly gentleman at the register told us that at that time of night, what we saw was what he had to offer.I was hungry enough to eat my feet, and was half a step away from drooling over the case. He asked, \"How hungry are you?\" and I, unthinking, replied, \"STARVING!\"I pointed out what I wanted - Chinese noodles and some of the ribs (don't judge me!), while the hubs chose a roll and some pasta salad. I then stood in awe as the gentleman began heaping food onto my plate. I do not kid when I say he heaped. By the time he was done, there was enough food to feed three people (or, you know - me when I'm hungry). He told us to take a seat, and he'd bring the plates out to us.We did, and he did - he had warmed the food back up for us, so that it was piping hot. Not only that, he came back to the table with a bowl of water for my hands, since I was tearing in to the portion of ribs and getting sauce all over the place.The food was good, too. I'm not ashamed to admit that I ate most of what he gave me - either from obligation or because my middle name is \"Oink\". No, it was because the food was good and sustaining. We were both stuffed by the time we put our forks down, and it was a nice feeling - we were warm, we were full and the food had been delicious. Plus, I'm giving huge points to the friendly gentleman behind the counter (he may have been the owner).On a different note, we were walking back to the hotel the following day, and I noticed a car door open in front of us. I happened to glance in, and noticed it was the gentleman from the night before, and he recognized us! We definitely would go back, if we're in the area again.",
