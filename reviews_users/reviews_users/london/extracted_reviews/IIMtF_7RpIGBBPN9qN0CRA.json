Absolutely one of the best meals I have EVER had.I went with two friends and even though I was the only one to order the tasting menu, both of my friends were brought (slightly smaller) portions of the first courses as well. Steak tartare was unbelievable, cabbage rolls were delicious, and my venison was tender and tasty. Between us we had 3 first courses, soup, 3 different mains, and 2 desserts and every single thing was delicious.The decor and the waitstaff are warm and welcoming. Really an all-around excellent place. I will be going back again as soon as I can.",

I live in the US and have been visiting the Daquise whenever I am London, usually twice a year, since the 1980s. It always had been a delightful experience to dine at the Daquise. It's charm stayed intact over the years and that was so reassuring. The food was wonderful and perfect for a late lunch after visiting the museums. It's a shame that the new owners didn't have the understanding to realize that they were buying a tradition and not just a shell. It was a sad experience to go there and eat overpriced food that wasn't up to the previous standard by any means, and to experience the loss of the once inviting ambiance. Needless to say, I won't be going back.",

    "text": "Pics@Chopstix2steakniveschopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026 Have you ever read someone's dining experience and it just gets you so excited that you have to head there like almost immediately?This was what happened when I read this on The London Foodie blog. When I was in Poland, we had a nice little lady who cooked lunch for us everyday and it was simple and delicious home cooked food. In fact, I loved her home cooked food slightly more than the restaurants that I went to. So you bet I have fond memories of Polish food.So I was really excited to read about a Polish restaurant and I zipped down there at the earliest opportunity. So it was a group of us who settled in for dinner.First coursePierozki \u00a39.5A few of us ordered the Pierozki with some choosing meat and some going with cheese. There isn't one that is better than the other; I think it is more a case of which filling appeals to you more. I preferred the cheese version more but it was a mixed vote on the choice of fillings.The dumplings did not have a thick or doughy skin which allowed the flavours of the fillings to shine through. Clean and tasty.Barszcz \u00a36S ordered the Barszcz and this was well received. Mildly sweet and hearty.Second courseKura w rosole \u00a0\u00a313Kaczka pieczona \u00a319The Kura w rosole is tender cuts of chicken on the bone, served in a slow cooked broth. Dished with home made noodles, lemon sauce and broth vegetables. The Kaczka Pieczona is a roast duck that has been stuffed with apples and served with boiled potatoes, cranberries and red cabbage stewed in red wine with fried fruitsIt's quite a refreshing change when you get a bunch of waiters coming out to slice, plate and serve you in front of your eyes. I love the theatrical part of it. Like this order of beef tartare and it was made right in front of you. It really adds an element of understated charm.Eating here brought back fond memories of my visit to Poland. This is not fine dining but serves unpretentious honest food.",

I had no napkin at my table and had to flag down a waiter to bring one well into the first course. I was brought an alcohol menu and when I tried to order I was told their liquor license had expired. Most of the meal it was difficult to get a waiter and once I paid the bill they basically shunned me. I wasn't really feeling the love, I guess.In any case, I'd go again.

    "text": "Wow talk about coming across a fantastic restaurant. I have never had Polish food before. This restaurant was a fantastic treat and a hidden gem. The staff and management is extremely friendly and knowledgeable with great recommendations. I will have to say the foods and appetizers that they recommend it was the best. Another unique thing about this restaurant is that they will bring the food to your table and serve it on to your plate. Some of the food is prepared right in front of you like this steak tartare which is one of my favorite dishes. I also loved the duck. My daughter tried the beef stroganoff and it was lovely. My wife tried did venison and it was incredible. Side dishes that accompanied the meals like mashed potato and beets or egg noddles and pasta was out of this world. This restaurant was so good and The food was so tasty, which makes me want to go back this week to try more items. Also we had I Apple Fritters \u00a0for dessert and it was fantastic.The prices are extremely reasonable . This restaurant also has a fantastic selection of wines and beers,both local and Polish. I also learned a lot about Polish food and the history of this restaurant one of the oldest restaurants in London and the oldest polish restaurant in London.DAQUISE Is the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time. DAQUISE has great ambience and The best food I've tried in London.",

    "text": "Wanting a restaurant near the Royal Albert Hall we found this one off Yelp and with great reviews. Polish food is not one of those foods a lot of people are usually in the mood for, maybe because they don't know what it consists of? However we decided to try it, OMG we were not at all disappointed, upon walking in the restaurant is quaint, neat and orderly and the ambiance is awesome. The service was above par so if that was any indication of things to come then we were in for a good one. We ordered the cabbage rolls, beef stroganoff, veal with cream sauce and the pork tenderloins in honey must and sauce (pictures will be posted). To say it was amazing is an understatement but seriously it was. As sides we got the carrots and the red and green cabbage. The chef brings your dishes from the basement (where the kitchen is located) and then him and his staff prepare the dishes near your table, it's super cool and unique. We loved the entire experience and made sure to let our waitress know to give our complements to the chef. If you are in the area, be sure to try this place",

I could have eaten another slice even though it would have put me beyond full. My fianc\u00e9e got the strawberry dumplings, which had an interesting taste: sweet from the strawberries, but a subtle savory aftertaste.After we paid the bill, we could choose a shot of liquor, which was a welcome surprise. \u00a0I chose one based on hops and honey. \u00a0It went down well and it was a good way to round off the meal.It was a great dinner out. \u00a0I would recommend it as something good to try and we are keen to try more Polish food now.",

I was tediously picking every bit of deliciousness clean of the bone, it was so good!Such a good find! \u00a0I intend to visit several times.",

What can I say. One of the best meals we've had in London. My veal scallops sauce was wonderful I almost wanted another whole bowl.

And there's something about the large mirrors and raw walls that evoke the 1930s but in a wounded way; perfect for this cuisine; and the high ceilings are beautiful. I love the location, tucked away, the last building before the underground rolls past (you can watch the trains from the window in the back bit if you're into that haha).It's all about the steak tartare for me. Prepared in front of you, it's simply a must. Love most things on the menu though... The duck is my standard delicious choice for a main but the breaded veal is excellent too. If you want something special ask for jajka faszerowane.The vodka must be tried as well. This is something not fully appreciated in the UK; a shot usually served at room temp and usually some kind of abomination like Smirnoff. At Daquise ask the waiter for a recommendation and they will serve you a variety of proper vodkas, ice cold and in frosted shot glasses as they should be. The honey vodka is my personal favourite but take the opportunity to be a bit adventurous ;)",

Lastly, the apple cake, which they say they make themselves, was the only appropriate end to a very hearty meal. \u00a0If you have a chilly evening free and an appetite, head right to this place. \u00a0After your meal you'll walk back out into the night air feeling very content.",

I'm surprised by the rave reviews, but maybe that's why I feel like it didn't live up to expectations.We wanted a good dinner on our first night in London and ended up here based on a reviews. The restaurant itself nothing to look at...in fact there is one wall with extensive water damage to it. Our table was very wobbly, but the waiter put some folded paper under to stop it from rocking, so that was nice of him. We ordered pierogis as a starter and these were excellent. We were asked which type we wanted and when we hesitated the waiter said we could try two of each kind and so we did. That was really good. I had the \"Tender chicken in pot\", which was chicken boiled in broth and served with veggies and homemade noodles. My husband ordered veal meatballs in dill sauce. My husband's was definitely the better of the two dishes. I found my meal lacked flavour. The chicken was nicely cooked, but not seasoned especially well. The broth was very standard chicken broth, similar to what I would make at home and the noodles were a nice texture, but lacked flavour. Dave's meal was considerably more flavourful. At the end we waited to ask for the bill, as the waiter talked with a couple for fifteen minutes. We finally had to interrupt their conversation to ask for the bill.I DID like that we coud watch as some meals were prepared fresh near the middle of the restaurant. They seemed to have a sort of hot plate station set up. They didn't make everything there, just plated items.I have no doubt to the freshness of the food, but the overall experience didn't quite cut it for me. I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again, but since I'm not in London very often, I would probably be inclined to give something else a try first.",

The mixed salad was fresh and quite tasty as well as the reasonable priced house wine of which I had a couple glasses. The menu was a bit limited but the entrees were quite varied. The main course I chose was the veal which was spectacular. I especially liked the way that the chef comes out to your table and plates the fresh off the stove food right in front of you. That was a very nice experience and gave me an opportunity to chat with him as he placed my meal in front of me. I don't think I have ever had that happen before.After the meal I was given the choice of several authentic Polish vodkas to choose from as an after dinner drink. The one I chose was bitter sweet, but tasty.In the end the bill was quite high, but I didn't mind because of the enjoyable dining experience.",

    "text": "Have you ever read someone's dining experience and it just gets you so excited that you have to head there like almost immediately?  This was what happened when I read this on The London Foodie blog. When I was in Poland, we had a nice little lady who cooked lunch for us everyday and it was simple and delicious home cooked food. In fact, I loved her home cooked food slightly more than the restaurants that I went to. So you bet I have fond memories of Polish food.  So I was really excited to read about a Polish restaurant and I zipped down there at the earliest opportunity. So it was a group of us who settled in for dinner.  First coursePierozki \u00a39.5A few of us ordered the Pierozki with some choosing meat and some going with cheese. There isn't one that is better than the other; I think it is more a case of which filling appeals to you more. I preferred the cheese version more but it was a mixed vote on the choice of fillings.  The dumplings did not have a thick or doughy skin which allowed the flavours of the fillings to shine through. Clean and tasty.  Barszcz \u00a36S ordered the Barszcz \u00a0and this was well received. Mildly sweet and hearty. Second courseKura w rosole - \u00a313Kaczka pieczona \u00a319The Kura w rosole is tender cuts of chicken on the bone, served in a slow cooked broth. Dished with home made noodles, lemon sauce and broth vegetables. The Kaczka Pieczona is a roast duck that has been stuffed with apples and served with boiled potatoes, cranberries and red cabbage stewed in red wine with fried fruits  It's quite a refreshing change when you get a bunch of waiters coming out to slice, plate and serve you in front of your eyes. I love the theatrical part of it. Like this order of beef tartare and it was made right in front of you. It really adds an element of understated charm.  Eating here brought back fond memories of my visit to Poland. This is not fine dining but serves unpretentious honest food.",

There were three of us & luckily got there just before the dinner rush on a Thursday night, otherwise I assume we would have needed reservations as it was pretty busy when we left. Cool ambiance, great food! The table side food prep was fun! Only two things prevented me from giving 5 stars; the young man who served us was a little rude & impatient and the house phone ring was strangely loud. Two of us had the pork tenderloin & one had the cod special. All very good!!!!",

    "text": "There is certainly no shortage of food available to people in Kensington and Daquise is proof that no matter what type of food you are in the mood for, you will be able to find it. \u00a0We were growing tired of the typical fare available in Kensington and I'd been to Daquise before and thought, why not give it a try again... I'm very glad we did.Polish cuisine is not foreign to me (call it my Jewish, Eastern European roots), but food cooked by Poles living in Britain is certainly unique. \u00a0The restaurant is large and airy, light pours in the windows (even when the sun is struggling to find its way out from the clouds) and the people in the restaurant are from all walks of life. \u00a0Whether you go to Daquise for business or pleasure, there is nothing about the menu too complicated that you would need help from the staff (and nothing so simple that you would think you were at an American-style chain restaurant), but the menu is easy and the wait staff and cooks (who deliver your food right out of the pans in which your food was cooked near your table) are unwilling or unable to explain.We've dined at every type of establishment: from devilishly simple Starbucks and Pret A Manger for a quick bite to the most formal affair that requires jacket and tie, we've done it. \u00a0That said, Daquise was wonderful and truly captured Eastern European, Polish fare with the type of service you'd expect in a fine restaurant in Warsaw. \u00a0The best thing at Daquise is that the fine fare does not come with a requirement for anything more than being casually dressed and expectant of wonderful food.We started with pierogi stuffed with cabbage and others with cheese, brought hot to the table from a woman in the kitchen whose Polish was so crisp that one could tell that she and her associates had experience with this food. The dumplings were followed by our lunch course that was made up of a lovely schnitzel with fried egg (something I'd missed since my last visit to Hungary), lovely sides of everything from mashed potatoes and dill with roasted vegetables, and a lovely beef simmered in bouillon with horseradish and a large bowl of broth left at the table to keep these morsels of loveliness moist.Our meal ended with apple fritters with jelly that one could tell came right out of the iron and came from a kitchen turning out food as orders came in. \u00a0We left delighted by this little restaurant and are looking forward to the return. \u00a0People came in and out as we ate and many simple had an appetizer as a snack to continue on with their shopping and walking in South Kensington. \u00a0We were on a mission that day that would take us from the tube stope in S. Kensington to do a bit of shopping, but the sun was out and we really wanted the walk so we ate, walked on to shop at Harvey Nichols (we pass on ever entering Harrods and intentionally walk on back streets to miss the crowds), but we had the energy to do it because the good people at Daquise fed us well and we cleaned our plates on good, hearty food that one struggles to find in a place like Kensington where (let's face it) portions are typically small and restaurants typically filled with people whose style of service is Western and many think they're simply too good for the posts they currently hold.Daquise is worth the stop.",

    "text": "I have been to my fair share for snobby pretentious places in London with a ridiculous price tag that makes you think the food is laced with ambrosia when really, it's not even worth a fraction of what it costs. This is not one of those places.The atmosphere is a bit understated but classy in its simplicity. Depending on the time you get here, it may or may not be packed. My friend and I arrived at around 6:30 and it was almost completely empty. By 7:30 it was completely full.The menu appears a bit too simple at first glance- nothing special- and the prices might seem way too high for the kind of fare that you're eating. But trust me when I say that it is all freaking amazing! You have to start with a glass of wine. They have superb quality that whets the appetite and prepares you for the meal to come.Every ingredient is made to compliment the main dishes perfectly. The Venison Medallions, for example, come drenched in a bed of cranberry sauce which makes the meat slightly sweet and deliciously tender. It comes with a serving of dumplings which are essentially gnocchi, with a chewy consistency and a hearty finish.For dessert, you absolutely HAVE to get the Pancakes with Cheese and Raspberry Compote. It's essentially a crepe, but it is unlike any crepe you've ever had. Slightly sweet, crispy, soft, chewy, and light. It's the perfect finish to a scrumptious meal.Yes, it's a bit pricey. But for just over 30 pounds, you can dine like a CEO on a slightly special day. Totally worth it.",

While contemplating Cold War history (you'll have to do your own research, they don't advertise it), you'll be served a delicate and flavorful cold beet soup by the chef - wonderfully seasoned with green onion and fresh herbs. The wild boar pierogi were delicate and flavorful, the wild boar goulash was melt in your mouth tender and was also brought to the dining room to be plated by the chef. Dessert simply must be the apple turnovers -warm and crispy, not too sweet. The service was among the best we found in London, attentive and prompt. The decor is old world elegant but not fussy and the old hewn wooden floor has seen some serious history. A true delight.",

We walked in without a reservation and were very happy to be accommodated with what looked to be the only available table that wasn't already reserved. So I'd suggest calling ahead to secure a table. \u00a0We started with a bottle of wine and the kielbasa and pierogies. At our server's suggestion, we were able to do a mix of all three pierogi varieties. The kielbasa was served over crispy fried onions with spicy mustard. Both starters were excellent and I'd be hard pressed not to order them again on a future visit. For my main, I had the beef stroganoff while my husband had the veal schnitzel, which was so tender you could cut it with a fork. It was fantastic and served with mounds of whipped potatoes and topped with a fried egg. My stroganoff was served with homemade egg noodles and was delicious in its own right, though the schnitzel definitely won out. There was no room for dessert but I have no regrets. That meal was one of my favorites of the year so far.",

We hadn't reserved anything, but I would recommend to, we were there pretty early, and it really filled out as we were there. Dimly lit, and an odd mix of a little posh, and a little run down. The dumplings are excellent, as are the pierogies. For mains, Stroganoff and the venison. Excellent, and served from pots and pans on to your plate, with fab veggies and excellent smooth fluffy mash. A really cosy homely touch, and from excellent friendly staff.We were a little miffed when they didn't have either of the puddings that took our fancy when we'd decided to go all out, but what they suggested instead were excellent. I would definitely go back, and definitely recommend.",

We booked a table for 21.00 and it wasn't really busy which meant it wasn't very loud. When you walk in you feel like you have been invited into someone's home. Food: we ordered meat and cheese dumplings. They were sooo good. It's a must. All 3 if us ordered different mains so we can try various plates. I hate the Snitzel with the egg which also came with carrots and it was really filling and yummy. I also tried a bit from the beef stroganoff and the pork honey & mustard. It was all very good. I think o preferred the honey &mustard dish. We were so full we had no room for dessert. Service: the service was good. They bring your food in pots and pans from the kitchen and serve you on the spot. The mash potatoes were not only made for me but others as well and the way they serve makes you feel like the meals are home-cooked. The waiter was a slow in general but really friendly I definitely recommend this place!",

This evening was a beautiful evening for a little walk, so I used Yelp and coin this restaurant. I am so glad I did! I started with potato pierogi saut\u00e9ed with caramelized onion and parsley! Amazing! The serving size of 6 is meant to be shared, but I am so glad I didn't have to!My main course was a special pork loin in mushroom cream sauce with gnocchi. I love mushrooms and this did not disappoint! It also came with a side of beets. I did not grow up in a beet family and I am used to pickled beets being sour. So I was very unsure. I tried them and to my surprise they were warm, with a mulled spiced wine flavor, and slightly crisp! Amazing! I had a small glass of the house red, a Spanish Rioja, which was also very good, and cheap! They had a large wine and cocktail list, and a few polish beers to chose from?While I didn't have dessert, I saw several people get dessert and it looked amazing!I didn't have a reservation and they were quite busy, but they were so kind and squeezed me in between to couples that were so engrossed with each other they didn't notice me there! But if you have more than 2 I recommend reservations. The place is small, shotgun style restaurant. The kitchen is in the basement and they have a dumb waiter cabinet with the old pulley system on top! It has the look of an upscale restaurant, with the atmosphere of a casual family dinner restaurant, and he prices were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of the meal! I will be dining here again!",

Softly stuffed, flavorful filling - we tried the cabbage, cheese and beef, all very different, all very excellent - perfect starter. It seems as though the food is actually made from scratch as well, the potato and egg noodles were excellent - pillowy soft, and just tender enough to make it seem fresh.

The latter was good but not sour enough and the former was nothing like Polish soup in Poland. Not recommended.Then we had potato pancakes with cured salmon, calves liver with apple and onions, boar pate and ruskie pierogi. Only the pate was not right....weird flavour but maybe just not to my taste. Calves liver was particularly excellent and the pierogi was my favourite of this variety in London so far. Potato pancakes were excellent too.Main courses were veal medallions, pork chop schnitzel and poached salmon. I wish the pork hadn't been flattened and kept thick and therefore juicier but it was still good. Mash good, cucumber salad needed more flavour. Apple fritters were enjoyed, home-made too!! The most exciting and lovely thing about this restaurant is that they bring pots with the food to the restaurant floor and serve you straight from the cooking pots!! Mash from one pot, veg from another, meat from a little frying pan.....so cool!! And they do this for every guest, however busy they are. I asked. Very commendable.Overall, a good experience, good service, can imagine the vibe of this restaurant is great when it's busy. It was good and it was quiet!!",

    "text": "Once again, Yelp reviews come through for me.Started with the potato pancakes (latkes) with salmon. It was plated right in front of me. Owner (?) came over and gave me some sour cream, but it didn't really need it. It also didn't stop me from eating the sour cream.The pierogies showed me what they are supposed to be, light, filling and delicious. This is a GREAT restaurant that should be on your radar if you are ever around South Kensington. Highly recommend. I don't think it serves a wide variety of liquor, but don't let that stop you from coming here and enjoying this restaurant.",

Portions were huge.Good wine list. Cool decor & ambiance. It was nice and intimate until 9pm-ish when it got insanely busy! Staff were good, though.",
