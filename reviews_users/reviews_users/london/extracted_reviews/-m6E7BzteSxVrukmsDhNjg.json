    "text": "Love Kick, not least because of the design of their menu's that i endeavour to steal every time i go in there. The best thing about it is the fact that it has huge screens for you to watch the footie, although arrive EARLY for big games as the place fills up really fast. They have every changing 'beer of the week' which is on offer (usually 2 for 1) so that means cheaper boozing! They also have amazing table football, and host tournaments so you can take over the place with your friends and go nuts! The decor is American diner like and pretty funky, and the heated (yet limited) outdoor seating means you can't walk past the place without being tempted to pop in and have a drink.",

Not sure if they are going for shoreditch trendy bar or lad's football bar, and it falls somewhere inbetween. It also tries to be a cocktail bar and quite arty as well. It was a sat night to be fair so I was repeatedly elbowed and it was rammed. Drinks prices expensive. No-one sttractive or stylish to be honest. I'd say this is more of a chilled mid-week sit outside type place. The little table cloths and flowers are cute, the food also way over-priced to really eat here much. Deinitley style over substance. We only lasted one drink as the music wasn't great. 2 stars.",

The standard of comedy was actually good and I was impressed (I'm usually sceptical of amateur comedy nights). The 6 performers had good chemistry with each other and had clearly put time and effort into the show. There was good audience participation, but that may have been helped by the fact there was a good number of friends in the audience (at one point the audience had to shout out quirks for the performers \u00a0choice suggestions were 'he's ugly' and 'she has 2 vaginas'). Overall it was a good night and the \u00a33 entry is about right to entice new comers in. The night could be improved if the downstairs bar was open and even more so if they extended the happy hour drink prices during the show.",

One time, at Christmas, my brother got a small Foosball table which was played until the legs fell off. True story actually. I was winning that game too...It is just another bar with a pathetic toilet facility and average but by no means limited selection of bottled beers. The decor gives off a nice relaxed vibe and the furniture has that nice weathered and beaten look that is comfortable to lounge around in drinking a Budvar explaining to people about the difference between Czech Budweiser and American Budweiser before realising that they don't really care and probably aren't even listening. So yes, a good and friendly but by no means great bar. Not much to make it stand out in a place like Shoreditch, indeed.They do have those Foosball tables though. Oh yeah.Nothing stirs the atmosphere like beer and some friendly competition and \u00a0little men pierced through the torso and forced to stay in line seems to be the perfect way to fan that competitive blaze. Just get some tokens from the bar and wait for a free spot by scouting out the talent.I have a friend who likes to beat me at everything we do. And when I say like, I mean that it seems to be one of his overriding life purposes. So it is extra satisfying to know that I can completely dominate him on the green field of little plastic men dreams and that he has no chance but is forced to try over and over in the vague hope of snatching some self respect. Not on my watch, pedro.So yes, if you are good at Foosball, take along some friends and embarrass them. I do! Don't feel petty, that is loser talk.There is also another place which I would assume is owned by the same mob called cafe kick which is up in Farringdon. It is much smaller and crowded but has a buzz about it on match day. See if you recognise all the scarves on the wall but look out for the suspicious Italian with wrists like a bullwhip. If he asks for a game, tell him you have RSI or something, it is better that way.",

I am all about being different and showing off your personality but when everyone around you is doing it, it loses its power. It becomes a oneness that completely negates the point of individuality. \u00a0Okay, rant over...moving on. :)Upon entering I realised that I had actually been here before 3 years earlier. The bar is very distinct with foosball tables in every corner that can be reserved for parties. It's a great place to catch a game and a cold brew if you are in the area.The bartenders could have been friendlier, the drinks were good but when it was time to close our tab the bartender wouldn't even look at us. And we had spent a pretty serious chunk of change in there.It is a fun atmosphere and I love playing games so I'd be more than happy to go back, but I'm going to have to make sure I get a side shave, dust off my graffitied converse kicks, black jeans and miscellaneous t-shirt with some dead celeb screenprinted on the front.

Seriously though, BK's food menu is ok in its offering but seems to be undecided in whether they do pub food or some kind of Mediterranean gastro offering. After chomping through a few dishes I found the food well presented but lacklustre.The drinks and cocktails are of a much higher standard than the food. They do Happy Hours which involve cocktails for \u00a34.75 and imported beers for \u00a32. When they show the football on the big screen downstairs, having cheap beers on offer is always a great pull. \u00a0Bar Kick still draws the Shoreditch massive who love to spend time playing table football. This bar will remain a giant of the Shoreditch scene for years to come.",

As patrons began to pile out, we lucked out and got a great spot on the leather couches. Luckily for us, Happy Hour began 15 minutes after we arrived - leaving us no choice but to enjoy a significant amount of \u00a32 bottled beers for the remainder of the afternoon.Following the numerous rounds, and an intense game of Jenga against Lauren H., the action then spilled over to the fooseball table. I must say, my companion was a highly skilled passer, which naturally allowed me to run the midfield and score at will. All in all I love this place. Great people, great drinks, great televisions, and get action all around. Walking distance taken into account - BarKick might get sick of seeing my face.",

Very popular bar for watching national and international sports games with a large screen to enjoy your favourite team on.Downstairs is an extended upstairs usually only open on their busy nights, namely Friday and Saturday.

It was the first time I visited Bar Kick \u00a0for London's very first Geek Foosball Championships. They hosted the event in the basement and reserved the four back tables - which were conveniently located next to the bar.About 50 or so tech heads participated (with another 50 cheerleaders aka spectators). We were each given a number at random to pair up with another geek. I'm not going to lie - I wasn't the best foosball player there and was knocked out in the first round oh well better luck next time :)And if you want to find out who the winners were I made a video which you can watch here: techfluff.tv/2010/02/16/\u2026",

Thankfully though there was a free bar, so we went to town. Having been knocked out in the first round and bringing shame on the country of Brazil, it gave us a chance to have a wander around Bar kick. Whilst there are more table football (are they called benches?) than you can shake a goat at, bar kick is a great place to visit even if it's just to pop in for a single beverage. The largest problem i noticed is that unless you are invited to an event sponsored by the beautiful people at Flash Talking, you will struggle to get on the tables as they are extremely popular and the standard is pretty good, so make sure you bring your A game. Prices for a beer are reasonable for Shoreditch, the bouncers are friendly and this unique atmosphere provides a top dollar night out. Make it a must in your East London travels.",

The downstairs area is more lounge-y, but still works fine for me.I like that Bar Kick is able to transition from a Saturday night Shoreditch hotspot to a place where you can watch a football game during the day. There is quite a community that will gather for the bigger matches. Of course I understand that most Americans don't like football, but did you have to put our flag above the entrance to the toilets?... We'll have the last laugh next year in South Africa!",

Taking it from the point of view of being a bar -- it works rather well; a reasonable enough selection behind the bar, with generally quite affordable prices (particularly during happy hour!).However, food-wise it seems to have an identity crisis. The menu reads as much more upmarket than the establishment otherwise seems to be, with a rather strange offering of Mediterranean-inspired dishes. That said, the food when it came was serviceable, but \u00a36 for a glorified sausage sandwich and a salad is pushing it a bit, in my book!A very good place to come and watch football, or play some table football with friends. But if you're planning to eat, you may be better advised to look elsewhere and come along here afterwards.",

Not sure how much the food was (our company paid for this), but it hardly fed 3 people, before it dissappeared. Another let down was that the one foosball table that we were given to play on was super wobbly and the other was missing parts, not something you expect from a foosball bar and expecially not if you're paying \u00a31 for each game. We still had fun though and I realised that my foosball skills are still terrible ( I blame the wobbly table though :p )",

    "text": "Cheap happy hour + foosball tables = how can you not have fun?!Bar itself is nothing special - international feel, flags everywhere and they screen big games if that appeals, though the England v Ukraine world cup qualifier was just background noise to me!Table footy however is my bar game of choice, and I got totally nostalgic for my uni bar. If you're a fellow foosball fan/geek (can't quite believe I'm saying this) then you'll find the tables a bit slow and the bars stick quite a bit. Fortunately this gave me more control and handicapped the 3 guys who were always better than me at uni, so yes this review is positively biased by the fact I won a lot wooh!The \u00a32 beers and \u00a35 cocktails also helped - worth getting there before 7pm. Already collecting pound coins for our next visit (now I just need the forearms to recover)...",

Very solid place, not a bad beer selection at all.Can't comment on the food, but would definitely be back for a quick game, and a great spot to host a party or a get together, good activity in a cool spot.",

    "text": "Big fan. Decent bar, though drinks wise lets be honest, they're the same as every other bar. The clincher here is the table football. Managed to get a table on a Friday at 11pm easily enough. \u00a31 a game. Sorted if you're just out with mates for a laugh. Really recommend this place if you're in this neck of the woods and want somewhere to go (without dancing)",

    "text": "Ever wondered why the name has a kick to it? This is a foosball (table football) place. So many tables to play foosball here. Stairs to the basement lead to a nice place with 6 foosball tables, 4 of them next to each other, two separate, a set of couches and some tables and a bar. This is a great place to book for team building events. The whole of the basement can be booked. They make good sandwiches too. At my current firm I regularly visit this place. Twice a year, we have a foosball tournament here. I love the ambiance. Everyone is screaming out names of the foosball players and encouraging and having drinks, taking breaks to bite a sandwich, it so full of life. The bartenders are also very helpful. They fix the foosball tables if something is not working. I totally recommend trying this out.",

A few tables upstairs however downstairs is a room packed full of tables. It seems the game is pretty popular in East London as the place always seems to be busy, even more so on a Friday or Saturday night. \u00a0They have a few TVs dotted around the place showing football most of the time so with the World Cup coming up it might be even harder than normal to get a place at one of the tables so arrive early",

We came here quite late on a Thursday night and still managed to score a foosball table and seats which was lucky. The wine was flowing and aggressive side showing, I could not fault one aspect of the atmosphere this great bar creates. We ended up staying until the bar staff had to physically remove us (and we still didn't want to leave). Great night and great bar, will definitely be returning (if anyone else is up for the challenge?!)",
