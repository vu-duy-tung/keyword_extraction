I had the 3-course pre-theatre menu and it was enough for 2 people easily for 13.95, which is crazy cheap for smoked salmon, a huge pizza, plus flan for dessert. Subtle flavors for those of us used to more robust Italian, but you can ask for more seasoning. I'd come again when I'm next in the area. Great value and location.",

Neither of us finished, which hasn't happen to me yet in London, and this is my third week being here. We both got the regular size, so if you're trying to decide, I'd probably go for the small, unless you're very hungry. I had a mango juice cocktail, which was just like mango juice, and that seemed a bit expensive for the size it was, but other than that the food seems reasonably priced. Our waitress was very nice, and the rest of the staff was very friendly too. It was a nice place to start of my grandmother's London experience!",

The atmosphere was great I wouldn't be surprised if we'd spent over two hours in the restaurant, our waiter even let us sample the wines for free, and have us some free starters (though I don't think that is regulation treatment of customers so don't expect this when you go).The service alone makes this place a 9/10, but with the food we received 5/10, considering it being an Italian restaurant the least we'd expect was an immaculate meatballs and pasta ?",

Using my trusty Yelp app, we found Spaghetti house and I am sure glad we did. The service was superior to what we have experienced in the London before. We were greeted with huge friendly smiles and very quick service. Our food took a little time to come out, but it was well worth the wait. I got the \"spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino\" and it was perfectly al dente and would order it over and over again. I cannot remember what my boyfriend got, but it definitely had seafood in it (which is why I choose to forget it) and he definitely said it was good. I can definitely recommend this Spaghetti house for both the service and the food and would come back if I am ever lucky enough to be in London again.",

    "text": "On a business trip I happened into this particular Spaghetti House just down the street from where I was staying. I was traveling alone this time and was really hankering for some decent Italian.Now the Spaghetti House is a regional UK chain with many spaces throughout the city. I have eaten at many of them before on previous trips, but really never considered them much more than pedestrian from the experience. Therefore, I walked into this particular Spaghetti House with nothing more than average expectations.I was dining late and it was the holiday shopping season, mid-week. The Oxford and Bond Street retailers were wide open with the locals on the streets weighed down with their bags and boxes. The restaurant was full with only a couple seats available.I walked in and was told it would be a 5 minute wait. That was not problem, it was a crisp and cool evening. No problem waiting outside. About 2 minutes later I was alerted I could be seated. I was placed in the front main room at a table for two facing the street.The menu was typical and the same as the others I had dined at before. They did had a polpette with pasta special in a spicy red sauce on the board. That I knew I would have. I also ordered a tomato, caper and anchovy salad.The salad course came out quick, just in time for me to enjoy with my first of more than a few Peronis. Crisp, cool and light, the salad was a great starter. It even came with a decent piece of fresh bread.After another Peroni, the secundi pasta course came out. It was about 10 oz of pasta, a very generous portion. The sauce was bright red and extremely flavorful. I know they used canned tomatoes, but that's OK since the best and consistent sauces are based on a canned product, especially when the canned tomatoes are imported from Italy. \u00a0What a chef adds to the tomatoes is what's key. This one was treated with roasted garlic, capers, finely diced onions, harissa paste (very uniquie and moderately spicy) and really good quality minced anchovy. Black pepper and a lite treatment of salt and that's all she wrote. The meatballs were pork and veal, exactly the way they should be. Oven roasted and tossed with the sauce. The flake your own parmigiana origianna from a block was a nice touch.The space is very tastefully decorated, not red and white checkered table cloths but nice bright and earthy tones.OK, for London Italian fare this Spaghetti House is better than most Italian Eating Houses I have experienced, and definitely the better of the chain.Only problem - the menu is still moderately expensive, even by London \u00a0standards. \u00a0My meal, less the Peronis, was $38 USD including service charge. The same meal in Los Angeles would run less than $20 including taxes and tip.",

Despite the casual atmosphere the food was excellent. My wife and I decided we wanted a bit of pasta and chicken. So we ordered Spaghetti Bolognese and Pollo Alla Siciliana.

We got spaghetti bolognese and the maccheroni pesto rosso siciliano. The spaghetti was delicious and on point. The maccheroni pasta, however, was not tender so didn't enjoy. I was expecting a basket of bread to go with the dinner and when it never showed up, I asked for it only to find out that you have to order it. So I ordered it, but they were out! Really?? Well there goes the review. The portions were small and we left hungry and dissatisfied. Very disappointed. I went next door for a slice of pizza!",

Or at least it wasn't your typical softer / chewier feeling you get with fresh pasta. The saving grace though, was the soup. Holy crap if this isn't the best soup I've ever had.",

The food was pretty standard - though they don't bring out complimentary bread and oil to start which I thought was a given for a proper Italian!Being a chain, it's not going to blow you away. But for a standard Italian quick lunch, it's pretty good.",

    "text": "What a delightful little place! I picked this restaurant on our first night in London because it was very close to the hotel & the reviews. We were warmly greeted & seated in the back dining room. Cute place & great atmosphere.Our server was phenomenal! He's original from Portugal but when he found H was from Argentina he started speaking in Spanish. He asked me if I spoke Spanish & I mentioned that I was 1/2 Japanese. Guess what? Yep, he started talking to me in Japanese & knew the language better than I (which isn't that hard but the words I recognized were legit). I ordered the penne di mare & H opted for the special which was lobster with spaghetti cherry tomatoes, garlic & red pepper. OMG, the food was freakin delicious! There was a ton of mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp & diced pancetta with tomatoes, garlic & red peppers. Loved the spiciness of the dish & loved that it wasn't drowned in a sauce. Just simple olive oil based goodness.We had a wonderful time at this place & I was surprised to find that this is a chain (my niece's boyfriend had a less than nice experience at another location). This is the location to go to if you want delicious food with excellent service.",

We ordered, my friend had the taglietelle pollo and I had the panciotti. They were both really tasty!! What I really loved was the portion sizes they have for the pastas. There's a normal portion and a smaller one which they called 'starter portion' \u00a0The only problem I had was that they do not give the complementary bread before the meal. They asked what we wanted bread/olives? We chose olives and paid for it!!I will definitely go back though! Good service!",

We will definitely be back sometime during our 10-day stay to try the bruschetta and assorted bread basket. The people around us had it and it looked delicious.",

I guess I don't have a great experience eating authentic Italian cuisine because in America most of the food I eat is Italian American, but still i thought it tasted amazing. All the ingredients were rich in flavour and the portions were not big at all, which is usually a problem in America. A nice filling meal and a great place to go with friends. All of us had an amazing time :-)",
