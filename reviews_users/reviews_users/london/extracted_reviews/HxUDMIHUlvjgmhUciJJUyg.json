    "text": "I had been looking for a high end indian restaurant that served more than your average indian meal in London, so was able to make reservations (but you really dont need to make reservations especially on a weekday.We saw that the restaurant was part of a hotel, which typically means that the decor will be beautiful (true), and the food average (untrue!) \u00a0It did feel odd that we were there at peak eating times (8 PM), and the restaurant was quite empty. \u00a0That didnt bother us because we actually wanted a quiet space to hang out, but usually thats another indication that there is something not stellar about this place.We were seated in the lounge area and started off with a mango bellini and a Bangalore based Cabernet Sauvignon. \u00a0We then went to our table, which was perfect for two people. \u00a0The waiter suggested that the chef make a menu according to our taste.We started out with mini poppodams and two diff chutneys, tomato and coconut. \u00a0Both tasted fresh and homemade. I had appetizers of : scallops (delicious), crab cakes (not my favorite) and hubby had lamb kothu (which was AMAZING), and chicken (delcious).Our waiter then brought out two small glasses of a spicy soup called rasam (i believe this is an acquired taste but me being indian, i loved it) \u00a0There was a slight faux pas by our clearly nervous waiter where he spilled part of the rest of the soup on me, but he apologised and we moved on. \u00a0He suggested a malbec for the following dishes and I think it went really well. The main courses were next:Black cod (amazing)Chicken (good but VERY heavy)Sides of : Lemon Rice --great accompaniment to the black cod, and actually everything, Spinach poriyal (nice and light), and malabar paratha. \u00a0I dont eat deep fried dishes so ordered two phulkas (thin flatbread very common in homestyle cooking)For dessert we finished with south indian coffee and a very interesting Goan dessert with chocolate and jaggery. \u00a0The dessert was probably my least favorite item on the menu and im likely not going to order that again. But we ordered a ridiculous amount of food, ordered a couple drinks and a carafe of wine and the bill was quite reasonable for what we ate and drank.",

Crowd was split between businessmen and tourists.I had the set lunch menu. \u00a0The meal starts with small papadums and a variety of tasty condiments. Then a tomato soup that is hot and aromatic, which makes for a nice experience. After that a few misses: the fried cauliflower was salty and bland, and the mango curry wasn't memorable. \u00a0The yellow rice was fluffy, as promised, but a little too oily. \u00a0But then things picked up again: the flavors of the Prawn masala and richness of the Malabar paratha are a terrific combination.",

    "text": "Compared to other Indian fine dining establishments, I found Quilon disappointing. \u00a0I'm told that my experience dining at this restaurant was out of the ordinary, so perhaps the other reviews should carry more weight than my vote. \u00a0Our group of three friends arrived at 9:45pm, which was the only reservation time we could secure. \u00a0We entered the crowded entry where we were greeted with the wall of scent of Indian spices. \u00a0Our table was not ready, so we were directed to the small lounge with a handful of dirty tables. \u00a0Empty glasses, food crumbles and dirty paper napkins were strewn about. \u00a0After about 10 minutes we flagged down a waiter, who took our drink order and didn't return. \u00a0Meanwhile, a wedding party in the adjacent room asked us to move to another table in the lounge so their larger party could sit there. \u00a0Once we were displaced, they never used the table. \u00a0Another 15 minutes later, our table was ready.We ordered the set menu, which arrived in intermittent waves over the next few hours. \u00a0The time between dishes was excessive and it was difficult to get the attention of the wait staff. \u00a0The set of sauces and chutneys at the start of the meal was over-spiced in the direction of HOT, not the sort of interesting spice combinations you expect in haut Indian cuisine. \u00a0One of the chutneys was chopped up lemon rind -- not zest, but the entire rind. \u00a0Other than that, the food was pretty good, but not extraordinary. \u00a0Nothing in the realm of a Michelin star restaurant. \u00a0The table was filthy and rarely cleaned, and we had a hard time keeping our water glasses full. \u00a0The room was so sweltering hot - and the hour so late - that even with an espresso shot I could barely endure the wait for the final dishes.My friend, who dined at Quilon regularly, assured me that this was not the usual Quilon experience. \u00a0Most likely the restaurant had not staffed up adequately to service the restaurant *and* the large wedding party. \u00a0In the end, despite the rather large bill, the manager scored some extra points by taking note of a friend's birthday and surprising us with a cake on our way out. \u00a0Perhaps if I'm in the area again I'd give Quilon a second chance.",

    "text": "This is possibly the most fragrant restaurant I have ever walked into. \u00a0The aroma on entering the foyer is more like a soap shop or a branch of Crabtree and Evelyn than a curry house. \u00a0In the halls and foyer are large brass bowls filled with water and flowers. \u00a0After walking in from central London it's like a nasal massage. The ambience sophisticated without being pretentious and the d\u00e9cor is clean and modern. \u00a0The staff are very attentive and professional. \u00a0I was lucky enough to come here with a seasoned veteran of Quilon who knowing the manager requested a tasting menu not listed formally anywhere.First arrived a long strip of mini poppadums with some revelationary dips, one spicy, one minty. Then we moved on to the meal proper with a selection of three starters, crab cake; mini masala dosa with vegetables and potato and sambhar; \u00a0Kothu lamb. \u00a0They were all outstanding. The crab cakes were delicious and meaty, the sambhar that accompanied the dosa was incredible and the lamb was one of the nicest things I've ever tasted at a restaurant.As a palate cleanser we were presented with glasses of a hot tomato based spicy broth which seemed reminiscent of tom yum soup.For main course we were treated to some fish with a spicy crust, an enormous king prawn in a peppery sauce, Mangalorean chicken, Malabar lamb, a yellow dhal, okra in batter and lemon rice. \u00a0Have the okra, it was excellent and I don't even like okra. \u00a0The sauces were rich, spicy without necessarily being hot and everything was delicious.We chose Flint Dry, a white from the Chapel Down winery in Tenterden Kent. \u00a0A fresh, clean tasting wine that is crisp without being acidic. \u00a0It worked perfectly with the rich flavours of the food we were enjoying, not a wine I would pick to drink on its own as I tend towards big soft burgundies which although fantastic wouldn't have worked half as well in this context.Desert, well it was desert, I've never been a fan of Indian deserts, I've tried seemingly hundreds of them but they have never worked for my palate, I find them too sweet, or too much like milk based dishes of my school days or too almondy..... My friend ordered, so we had a selection of baked yoghurts, some unusual wheat based tapioca and a strange cake that seemed to be made of layers of pancake separated by chocolate sauce. \u00a0None of them really worked for me, but I put that down to me rather than the deserts.We finished off with espresso and some phenomenal discs of chocolate that arrived presented like a tree on a small wooden staff. \u00a0The chocolate discs were \u00a0thin, dense and packed with flavour, the white chocolate was infused with cardamom and the dark with rose oil. \u00a0Fantastic and possibly worth coming for on their own. \u00a0I'm going to rate this restaurant based on everything bar the deserts as recognising my prejudices, I never order deserts in Indian restaurants. To give a restaurant five stars I have to wake up in the dead of night, worried that they will close or that it might get so famous I'll never get a table. \u00a0The sort of place that gives me withdrawal symptoms if I don't go every couple of months. \u00a0These places might not necessarily be expensive, not everything on the menu need be that good, but there are things so good that I might put them on my dessert island discs of food or my last meal before firing squad option list. \u00a0It was close, but in the end, excellent just isn't enough for five stars from me and this was excellent food, a great Indian fine dining experience, so fine that they have a Michelin star, fine enough in fact that they have a very solid Yelp four stars. \u00a0Go, you'll love it.",

The menu is slightly different here given you order a 2 or 3 course lunch per person rather than al-a-carte for the table. The 2 course has an appetizer and main dish while the 3 course has an added dessert. Bread and rice comes along with the courses and to supplement the food they serve some vegetables as additions. All the food items were really well made and we enjoyed them. The only issue was the total food quantity was much more than what we could possibly eat so ended up wasting a bit of food :(",

    "text": "It is clear why this place has a Michelin star. We had an excellent dinner \u00a0experience at Quilon. Also without a doubt this was the most expensive \"Indian\" food I have ever had. Indian is in quotes because I would describe it as more of a fine dining experience with Indian influences, rather than Indian food. I absolutely loved the black cod. Delicate and very subtle on the spices. Really special. The scallops were nice, but I think you can get similar scallops at many different restaurants (not necessarily Indian)For entrees, the lamb shank easily reigned supreme over the Quilon fish curry, which was a decent curry, but at that point I was expecting a bit more. Every other dish before the fish curry was superb. Oddly though, as the fish curry sports the restaurant name. But back to the lamb shank, it was cooked with perfection, falling off the bone, but still maintaining that lamb taste. It comes in a tasty curry of its own. The mango lassis were a nice way to cool down while enjoying all the spice. I would def go back to try other dishes.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ate here purely because of the Yelp rating and proximity to our hotel. The restaurant was under construction in the front so it was hard to see the name at night, but once we entered I really loved the atmosphere / decor and quickly forgot about the exterior.We ordered the lemon rice, prawn masala, mango curry, malabar paratha, and pachadi. We also received some complimentary appetizers. Everything was absolutely delicious. My least favorite would probably be the prawn masala (I heard they were well-known for their seafood but this is probably for a different dish), but everything else was very flavorful and filling. I typically eat bread with my yogurt and the malabar paratha/pachadi mix was great - the pineapple and pomegranate mix balanced out the yogurt, which paired very well with our spicy dishes. I was skeptical about lemon rice (I was considering ordering the Tomato rice) but I'm glad I went with it; the lemon rice and mango curry went very well together.Throughout our meal, we had several different waiters serving us and asking about our experience, which was a bit confusing but I suppose better this than having no service at all :)While ordering, I indicated that we only wanted the small prawn masala dish but we got charged for the large. I noted this to (one of) our server who immediately apologized and adjusted our bill. The manager (?) also apologized on our way out while holding the door open for us. I really appreciated this act of customer service.Overall, I had a lovely time and would recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I came here for the first time around a year back and had a lunch set menu which was so-so. It was also not ridiculously expensive for a Michelin Starred restaurant. But we decided to do an \u00e0 la carte experience as well. We were 4 of us and we did not set a budget - just decided to eat and drink well.Drinks: The beers are excellent. We tried a few and all of them tasted good and did not make me cringe with the bitterness. Particularly liked the Innis & Gunn. The others also had some wine and cocktails which got some good reviews. Starters : We ordered some chicken, crusted fish and kothu lamb. The lamb was not what we expected and was a bit mushy. The fish was amazing with rough spices on it fried to a T. The chicken was soft and juicy. Mains : We had fish moli which was good - tangy+spicy = tasty. The prawn masala had some great masala paste. The lamb biriyani was good, not greasy - just the right amount of spice. The yoghurt that came with the biriyani was a highlight (always find it funny when you eat so much food and end up liking the most insignificant thing!). We also ordered some spinach poriyal which was so-so. It was a token to being healthy and having some greens. Porotta : The only reason to dock a star is the malabar porotta. This is a staple food that Keralites like to eat when they go to a restaurant. Its traditionally meant to be big and very unhealthy with dollops of oil etc. Here it was dry and tiny. Service : Service was good. I would say it was excellent - but considering I am no regular Michelin star restaurant hopping person, you can make of that what you will. I particularly liked the complimentary rasam (which is a spicy drink they served between the starters and mains). The complimentary dessert ice cream was a flop though. All in all \u00a3200 for 4 is not bad for an incredibly filling meal at a top restaurant.",

Crackers with various toppings was complimentary, it was garlicky, some spicy some not. 1st course was soup, lobster broth, delicious. 2nd, 4 little tastings of very delicious tastes which included my fav, scallop. 3rd, sampling of butter lobster, prawn masala, black cod, all very good, esp butter lobster and prawn. 4th was main course of fish curry, byirani rice and coconut snow peas or asparagus, all very flavorful. Dessert was pistachio cake with ice cream, that was my favorite dessert because it wasn't overly sweet, my husband had chocolate coconut bar which was ok but clearly I would advocate for cake. Everything was 5 star worthy, understated elegance of restaurant, you don't need to get dressed up but wear neat attire, it was not pretentious and people seemed to enjoy ethnic food in classy quiet not over the top atmosphere. It did not appear to be a lot of food but we did not leave hungry and we left some food on our plates. If you are looking for something different, I would highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "We came here on a short trip to London and I was really looking forward to trying out Michelin Star quality Indian food. \u00a0Sadly, we were all a bit disappointed, even more so now that I've returned and seen the price in USD.We ordered the tasting menu, so it was not a matter of choosing the wrong dishes and after travelling to Kerala before, I feel like we understood the cuisine.The highlight was definitely the masala prawn and fish course. \u00a0The other courses did not stand out above Indian food I've had elsewhere, with the biryanai being especially disappointing.The sad thing, is that the food at Bistro (also at the Taj) we found to be superior to the better known Quilon.",

    "text": "So we all know going to typical Indian restaurants means lots of good food but a smell in your clothing that will last days. Well, this place is an exception!The kitchen is covered behind 2 separate doors and there's little to no smell of fried food or curry sauce and spices in the seating area.The food is delicious and clean with very appealing finish.The staff is very accommodating and explains the menu as well as helps walk you through what you have ordered and answers questions you might have.The price is great too.We ordered a vegetarian dish and a fish/prawn yellow curry dish. Both came with rice and lots of good side dishes.Although we did not order appetizer, they brought us rice bread with several yummy side dishes (spicy).After our food, we did not order desert but they brought us 2 scoops of sorbet. Yummy!The price including VAT and service charge = \u00a350. We had bottle water for drink.So... Given the good food and very reasonable price, this place gets a 5 star in my book.",

Well done. Our server was on the task all night. They took care of every detail. The server even noted that I have an interest in spicy food early during the evening. Unbeknownst to me, he then made arrangements to tweak one of the dishes for me. This was a pleasant surprise and appreciated. Again, incredible experience spectacular food. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "We heard Indian food in London was incredible and they were right. \u00a0This was our first night in London and our first nice restaurant in the first of a few \"honeymoon\" dinners; we just got married three months ago.So this place was a little hard to find because there is a small sign outside. \u00a0Anyhow asked for help and quickly found the place. \u00a0Upon entering Quilon we found it to be modern, very comfortable and since we were early very quiet; that soon changed as the place got very full. They asked us if we would like a cocktail before dinner and we could not pass that up. \u00a0They made two unique cocktails to their establishment and they were very tasty, I could have had a few more.Shortly after our drinks, we were brought to our table. The waiter made a few suggestions and told us they were known for their seafood. \u00a0So we chose the seafood tasting; where they bring you a few chef-picked seafood dishes. \u00a0My wife is crazy about lamb and they were more than happy to make a substitution. \u00a0Then craziness happened...They asked us if we were here for something special and I mentioned we traveled to London for our honeymoon and this was our first stop. \u00a0Then the food did not stop coming, I am serious. \u00a0We got our dinner as ordered, small plates, amazing tastes which I am still craving (I must find a good Indian restaurant in Seattle FAST) and after all of that they brought dessert on a plate wishing us Happy Anniversary and then more dessert and more. \u00a0I literally got up and asked the waiter to stop bringing us food. \u00a0Let me explain they were very happy we chose their restaurant for our honeymoon. \u00a0I asked them to bag up for the food that was left over and once I got back to the hotel they had packed our to-go bag with more chocolates. \u00a0Who does this? \u00a0What a top-notch establishment.Anyhow if you are in London and want a fantastic experience with the best Indian food I have ever had then please make reservations in advance and then go eat. \u00a0But be hungry.",

I got the Fat Bastard Pinot noir that was a great way to pair the food. For main we got the prawn masala and the coconut with asparagus and snow peas. The bread on the side was delicious and went well with the prawn masala. The little chips with sauces at the beginning I forgot to mention are also so varied and tasty. Loved the soup they bring as appetizer. We closed with the vermicelli kheer a berry lassi that were exquisite. They bring you chocolate to close the dinner. Perfect service and they gave us great food recommendations. 10 out of 10!",

The table set up is really nice and the restaurant is very clean and sleek.Service was a bit rocky in the beginning as nobody came by to take our order. My husband finally got up to request that someone come by and from there on out service was fantastic. The manager (?) asked if everything was okay numerous times, saying that I wasn't eating much and he'd be happy to have the kitchen send out something different if I preferred. (I ate MORE than enough!)Food was quite good, but admittedly different from the typical Indian food I prefer (north vs. south). -- Seafood broth was a highlight.-- Husband enjoyed the salad.-- Chickpeas were excellent.-- Seabass was very good and more importantly, good quality.-- Rice was very good.-- Parathas aren't usually my thing but my husband enjoyed these (so much for his no-carb diet).-- Husband went to town on all the complimentary desserts as well - he enjoyed the cake and the trio of yogurts on my behalf (I am lactose-intolerant). Manager once again noticed I didn't eat the dessert and brought out a complimentary dish of mango sorbet for me, which was excellent.Overall Quilon really did surpass my expectations, mainly due to the fantastic and thoughtful service. I didn't love the style of food but I really can't get this restaurant any less than 5 stars for making my birthday so unbelievably special.",

It's a very dark intimate feeling in the restaurant.we tried the tasters with the paired wines which were 90 pounds each. The tasting items were all very small portion size virtually smaller than tapas. among the many dishes about half of them were amazing and really a delight. The other half were a little disappointing.The amazing dishes for the crusted fillet of fish, the crabcake, the broccoli cake, and the pistachio cake desert. The prawn Curry was quite good but it was pretty mild and the serving was precisely one large prawn per person.among the dishes that we we're not that impressed with were the fish broth, the biriyani lamb, the curry chicken, the kheer, the coconut asparagus, The lintel multiply tiny thin broth certain cocktail glasses, and the chai masala tea. The wines were all excellent. I'm not sure it was worth 60 pounds worth of wine drinking for two of us to have four half glasses of wine each. going back to the staff and the customer service which was exceptional, they were very flexible in swapping items on the menu, giving us replacement dishes when we weren't happy with something, etc.we were surprised if they actually charge for pounds for tapwater.however the receipt said that no tip is expected.",

    "text": "Definitely come here for some of the best southwest Indian cuisine London has to offer, particularly the seafood--they do it right at Quilon! Centrally located off Buckingham Gate, this small but quaint eatery greets you with beautifully flower-scented air as you step into the cocktail lounge. Upon being seated, you will start by enjoying their complimentary poppadoms with several mild to spicy accoutrements. We had a tasting menu, so the first course was the lotus chop and crab cake. The mango sauce compliments the lotus perfectly, while the mustard paired excellent with the softness of the crab. Next the seafood dish, which was absolutely amazing! Like I said, their seafood is IT! The prawn masala includes one of the biggest, juiciest and tastiest prawns I've ever had. I would've licked my plate if it weren't for the fact that I was sitting in a Michelin-starred restaurant, so I had to mind my manners! Loved the spicy tomato soup as our intermezzo. Onto the next dish, which was meat... And unfortunately somewhat disappointing, but not entirely. I enjoyed the malabar lamb biryani, with its generous chunks of lamb and excellent fusion of spices to deliver an exceptional flavor, but the mangalorean chicken fell way short of my expectations. The chicken itself seemed dry, almost like powder and far from succulent. The sauce it was doused in had an overpowering coconut flavor that really overwhelmed the entire dish. I enjoyed the yoghurt with pomegranate, and the asparagus & snow peas were good, but yet again, more coconut infusion into the flavors (Btw, I'm not a coconut hater--by all means, I absolutely love it! I cook with coconut oil, drink coconut water, etc... However, it really did seem to be used a wee bit too much in this dish, so maybe if I had spoken up, I would've been lucky enough to try their black cod and had given the 5 stars that Quilon deserves). An underwhelming pre-dessert followed by a well-rounded pistachio cake made up for it. My husband had the masala chai and chai latte cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e--both were absolutely excellent, smooth and rich. Impressive considering its near impossible (for me) to find decent dessert items at an Indian establishment. Discreet and attentive waitstaff do an outstanding job to make sure you are satisfied with your experience. All in all, Quilon gives you more bang for your buck than the average Michelin-starred restaurant out there.",

I have been there 6 times already, and I have made point returning at least twice a year.Regarding the food, everything is delicious from their crab-cakes to the spinach. I also highly recommend their naans which are the best I have had. The best way to order is to ask 2-3 plates per guest and share everything. I cannot emphasise this enough, everything on the menu is great! In addition, they also bring exquisite complimentary appetizers.The setting is in line with the quality of the food. Not only is the decoration understated and elegant, but it is also soothing as the lack of windows creates a very cosy atmosphere.The service is polite and discrete, as it should be in a Michelin-starred restaurant. The advice provided has always been very good. As a result, don't be afraid in case you have no idea what to chose and follow the waiters' recommendation.Although from a culinary point of view, it might not be as innovative and baffling as other Michelin-starred restaurants (not in London though), it is unequalled in London in terms of value for money.",

The fish curry had the most bland flavors ever. And honestly I can make a way better Malabar paratha. The service was nothing spectacular either.

    "text": "Popped into Quilon for dinner after a long day at work. Had couple of colleagues joining me and I offered to treat them to food from my land.I didn't look up the restaurant on Yelp or Google just got there. No Menu was displayed outside so no idea how pricey it was. Upon entering the reception staff greeted us and took our coats. The Maitre d' took us to our table and we were encouraged to sit where all the other guest were sat - reason given was there were only two waiters and we will get a better service.Menu and options were bit of a let for me personally, while Quilon positions it self as a seafood specialty restaurant I was hoping to find some authentic dishes from the west coast and I hardly found any non-fish based dish which was worth a try. The menu was pricey and beer expensive (\u00a37 for a Mongoose). Then I read on their menu that it is a Michelin star (later found out 1 Star) restaurant frequented by MP and Lords et al.Ordered Almond chicken and Crispy Okra for starters , nothing exceptional and have to say both are not from west coast. I was hoping to find poricha kozhi (deep fried chicken). As far as the mains were concerned, the Kerala / Malabar Parotta (flaky bread made of refined flour) appeared handmade and tasted fresh. Mangalore Chicken curry was so-so and very small portion and not worth \u00a322!Skipped the desert but we were offered some chocolates. The bill came to \u00a3125 for 4 (3 starters and 2 mains we shared), we only had 3 beers. Staff was attentive and food was good but not great or exception considering the price and the Michelin. Moreover, we were also charged for a dish which was never served! I bind shift, we should have gone for the sampler menu which I believe was \u00a320 per head.The ambiance is great, staff exceptional, food was not that impressive so not a place I will visit again. Having said, if you like sea food and your curry and you happen to be in Vic and want to try out a Michelin star Indian, do pop over. You might like it.",

OMG lol. Okay I'll move on :) Well Quilon was good but not special and expensive too. Menu appeared to be contemporary take on Indian food and had some fusion items as well. There are no samosas or traditional curries here peeps. A starter was complimentary which was greatly appreciated but a couple dips/concoctions weren't that good and didn't go together well. We shared the cauliflower chilli fry (yummy), prawn masala (my favourite), manglorean chicken (like watered down butter chicken or murgh makhani, was good though), two aubergines dish (decent), tomato soup (delish and complimentary), lemon rice (its rice? haha) and paratha (crispy and chewy good). Had high expectations given the Michelin star rating but fell short. Nice location near Buckingham Palace and good service. My overall rating is 3.5 stars but wouldn't return again.",

Seated promptly (6:30 is early for dinner) Service was EXCELLENT- prompt on wine/water refills, checked up on us just multiple times, delightful ambiance overall. Tried to push the pre-set menu a bit, but I don't blame our server at all because of you've \u00a0never had South Indian coastal cuisine, it's a good deal to try multiple plates on the menu. We ordered crab cakes as the starter to split, a bit small for \u00a313, but delicious and mustard sauce was a great touch. Had 2 mains (black cod- which literally melts in your mouth!) and the fish curry (mango curry, not spicy), along with the potato & cauliflower (little kick, good texture), chickpea masala, lemon rice, and a pastry-like bread. For dessert, we were going to order the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but after asking our server what he recommended, he pointed us to the pistachio cake. It did not disappoint! The cake was buttery, not super sweet, with a center ball of pistachio ice cream. By the time we left at 8:30, the place was packed! Ambiance was low key, mix of clientele, and balanced music with conversation buzzing. I would not recommend bringing young children to this establishment, as it's very low key and relaxing environment. We will definitely be back!",

I was a little bit hesitant because my experience in the states with Indian food hasn't always been great but this exceeded my standards by far and opened me up to a whole new love for (Southern) Indian cuisine. I can't possibly remember everything we ate, because my family's knowledge of Indian food way surpasses mine and I let them order what they knew would be best. Some things I tasted were the lemon rice, crispy okra, mapla chicken, crab cakes, mini masala dosas and kovallam fish curry (mango flavor). Let me tell you that all of it was incredible. I didn't have a single complaint right down to my mango lasi. The place really is as good as it gets, and previous to this I wasn't even that interested in Indian food. The service was also extremely attentive and personal, our waiter checked up on us several times. If I ever get myself back to London, which I certainly plan to, this will again be my first stop.",

Service is exemplary, with the decor firmly seated in the 'traditional/conservative' bracket - tables are nicely spaced, and you don't find yourself clashing elbows with the table next to you, unlike many of London's 'trendier' outfits. When we visited, it was part of the London Restaurant week offer, which saw us nibble our way through a delicious tasting menu, highlights including cauliflower tempura and pistachio lamb curry - the food was all innovative and created a clear distinction between this and an 'ordinary' curry house, tempting the palate into wanting to return in future. Whilst the food and service excels, the place is somewhat let down by the d\u00e9cor and ambience. My partner an I were the youngest dining there by a good twenty years, save maybe some children who were dining with their parents. I found the d\u00e9cor to be somewhat bland, which combined with rather bright lighting, doesn't make Quilon lend itself to a romantic dinner, despite the intimacy offered by generous spacing between the tables. The place seems well suited to business lunches and dinners, and I could imagine that it would be an impeccable destination for such events - but despite the exemplary food and service, it doesn't quite cut the mustard for a romantic dinner, and there's a dearth of places to visit in the immediate vicinity for after-dinner drinks.",

    "text": "Finally !!!At last i have found a good South Indian (well ... not totally ... but the strong Kerala influence in the menu is obvious) restaurant in central London.Quilon, named after a small town in Southern India (okay ... i am guessing about this), is located a little off Victoria st near the St James Park tube station. Its a bit difficult to find if you are not familiar with the area ... look for the Indian flag and the flag of the Taj group of hotels.I came here for a Sunday lunch. The place was almost empty. I hope more people come here for dinner, as the food is fabbulous.I ordered some fish for starter, which was good. However i was really impressed by the vegetable dosa that my friend asked for. The stuffing was evenly spread throughout the interior of the dosa, and not merely at the centre as in most places. Also it was a mixed vegetable stuffing and not the potato curry you see elsewhere ... and it tasted really good.For the main course we had lamb as well as a paneer dish. Quilon has a greater percentage of sea-food dishes than any other Indian restaurant i have been to in London ... but i felt that their vegetarian fare was better.I was a bit disappointed with the dessert ... but maybe we were ourselves to blame. Note to myself: Never ever order ice-cream with cracked pepper ... they don't go well together :(We had gone for the set lunch menu. At 22 pounds for 3 courses + coffee, it was really reasonable, especially given the fact that Quilon holds a Michelin star.My friend had arrived an hour and fifteen minutes late ... but they were never impatient and did not force me to order quickly ... so i would rate their service level as quite good ... though the fact that nobody was waiting for a table probably helped.On the whole, a very good place for some off-beat South Indian fare.",

    "text": "I visited Quilon on the evening of Monday March 23rd, taking advantage of the three course menu offered for twenty five pounds in conjunction with London Restaurant Week. I could not been more disappointed. London Restaurant Week claims on its website to offer the chance 'to enjoy fine dining at a fraction of the price'. I would suggest that if Quilon is not intending to deliver on such a promise then it should cease its affiliation with the promotion. We began with a starter of chargrilled marinated chicken alongside Cauliflower Chilli Fry, which were individually very tasty, yet sat uncomfortably alongside each other. The main insult, however, was delivered with the main course. A confusing menu suggested we were to be given a choice between Pistachio Lamb Curry, Cottage Cheese and Coloured Pepper, Spinach Poryial, Lemon Rice and Malabar Paratha. Not fancying a simple piece of bread as a main course we were somewhat relieved when we were informed each of us would enjoy the full selection. Quilon needn't have bothered. I would rather have enjoyed a large plate of spinach than the pitiful portions we were dealt here: we received enough for each of us to enjoy a spoonful of rice, two each of spinach and cottage cheese. The real insult, however, came with the lamb: four bitesize pieces. Between two. Neither myself nor my companion have particularly large appetites, but a grand total of two mouthfuls of lamb each was pathetic, however tender or tasty it might have been (and although pleasant it was by no means special). What's more, it was lukewarm, the result, my companion realised on a glimpse of the kitchen on the way to the ladies' room, of every single dish that was part of such a promotion being kept on a hotplate. If this is how the supposed piece de resistance that convinces bargain hunting diners to return to spend more money is prepared, one can only sadly assume that all the side dishes were made in bulk and dealt out into dishes in a similiar fashion. An unremarkable mango sorbet concluded the meal, but by that point we had lost interest. London Restuarant Week should be about offering people the chance to see what a restaurant can do so that they feel inclined to return. I appreciate that a set menu still has to return profits, and that a restaurant is never going to serve lobster as part of a \u00a325 set menu. At the same time, they should try to make compromises to make it at least seem like the customer's getting a good deal, serving something that costs a little more to make as a choice alongside something that costs a little less, knowing that equal amounts of both will probably be oredered and thereby cancel each other out. Maybe you might also place something a little exciting and (god forbid) freshly cooked on your menu, and think about allowing your guests to leave sated. Charging \u00a325 pounds for measly proportions of ingredients, mostly inexpensive vegetables, which I would estimate cannot have cost more than \u00a35 a head to produce, is an insult to the customer and a blatantly selfish use of the concept of London Restaurant Week to make a quick extra buck on the side. Congratulations to Quilon, they made it from both of us last night, but we shan't be returning any time soon.",

I had a set lunch menu where the chef chooses the dishes for you. It was kind of an Indian tapas, with a range of small dishes, all delicious. the starter of masala dosa was gorgeous, very fresh. The main was a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of flavours - chicken curry, chapati, a lovely cauliflower dish, green beans that appeared to be deep fried. I was stuffed by the end of it - stuffed and happy. All the moreso because I didn't have to pay for the meal :) I was a little disconcerted that the prices were not on the menu - that always makes me worried so I'm assuming it was fairly pricey. Totally worth it though.",

The food is wonderful - Goan and Keralan in origin - delicately spiced, hot dishes clearly marked, all of it sublimely well cooked. Lots of seafood dishes, the seafood soup to start is a particular favourite, fresh shellfish presented in a bowl then a coriander scented broth is poured over releasing the most delectable smell. A main of guinea fowl supreme was a dry curry, the flesh wrapped in a green chilli and coriander paste that was gorgeous. Sides of lemon rice and fresh yoghurt were perfect. One of our party liked the crispy okra but it wasn't me, not a fan of this little green veg. Service is attentive and charming. While it is true that the a la carte is not cheap, the set price lunch 7 days a weekat \u00a324 for three courses is a bargain for food of this level of excellence.",

Owned by the Taj Group, it attracts mostly business people as it's expensive and provides a wide-ranging seafood menu as well as more typical dishes. We had a business / private dinner there with some Indian friends who came originally from Kerala, and they found it excellent. We let them chose our food - apart from the fish, as they are vegetarians. Starters included grilled scallops with spiced coconut cream, gobi kempu bezule (cauliflower tempura) and delicious mini masala dosas. They serve an 'amuse-bouche' of a glass of hot rasam (spiced with tomatoes, peppercorn, red chillies, coriander and tamarind) before the main course. We had beautifully cooked black cod (made famous as the signature dish at Nobu) as well as superb scallops and squid. There's an excellent wine list and we broke the usual rule about drinking spicy whites with Indian food when we discovered that they had my all-time favourite pinot noir - Neudorf's Moutere - which was absolutely superb. Quilon is quiet and comfortable and the tables well-spaced, making it ideal for discreet conversation. The service moves a little slowly at times but there are plenty of staff and one can get attention without making a fuss.",

A late decision to utilise more Times Fine Dining vouchers prompted a frantic ring-around to see who was open on the August Bank Holiday, as this financial recess seems to have extended to the restaurant sector. Odd, considering this could be one of their busiest days of the year. With limited choices on offer, we happily opted for Quilon's Keralan-influenced cuisine, located in St James on Buckingham Gate. The dining room is vast, with seating for over 100 covers, but the layout is such that one does not feel engulfed. We were on the three course lunch menu, reasonably priced at \u00a322 (without the dining vouchers). There were numerous choices for each course which is a welcome surprise in this price band. Home made chutneys were deliciously spicy and poppadums were light and crispy. A starter of curry leaf and lentil crusted fish was very well spiced, with the fish cooked perfectly. My main of halibut Koondapur curry was slightly lacking in heat but a refreshing change from the oily offerings on Brick Lane nonetheless. But the crowd pleasers here are the parathas, oozing with ghee and delectably moreish. There is a good selection of bottled beers from various parts of the world. Coffee was excellent and included in the price. Service was prompt and friendly. This was a very enjoyable lunch and beats Atul Kochhar's ventures hands down. In retrospect, I'm glad the other places I phoned were closed.",

    "text": "Indian Haute Cuisine at its finest is on display at Quilon complemented by impeccable service and rich decor creating an ambience and experience not to be missed. While not inexpensive, those who come to London with an expectation of enjoying Indian food should not miss the opportunity to dine here.Located near the Taj Hotel in Westminster, \u00a0Quilon provides a sumptuous meal. My wife and I shared starters of scallops and fried cauliflower both of which sounded a little mundane \u00a0but the \u00a0flavor profile blew us away. It only got better after that.The black cod is the signature dish but don't miss the prawns masala or the chickpea curry.To top everything off, the gift dessert - given all the delightful meal choices, I can't imagine they sell a whole lot of dessert orders - of strawberry sorbet, and discs of rose petal milk chocolate and cardamom white chocolate left us wondering, How did they do that?",

Really enjoyed my small dosa appetizer and my lamb biryani as well as their desserts. This is high-end Indian at its best - tasty, delicate food served in a quiet atmosphere with cozy lighting.",
