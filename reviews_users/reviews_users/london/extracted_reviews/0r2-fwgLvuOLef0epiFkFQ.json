There's queueing, so you better arrive early.The Full Aussie Breakfast is not different from the English classic but done well. Funny story: When our order was taken and the waitress repeated what we had said, she read \"So 3 Full English Breakfasts...\" and her colleague walked past and hissed into her ear \"Aussie! Full Aussie Breakfast!\". It was hard not to burst out laughing. I guess this says something about the originality of the place? Anyways, it's a really cool space and the nicest breakfast spot I know in Notting Hill.",

I never understood why it closed, especially as it was replaced by a never-ending succession of ill-fated ventures.At long last, a suitable replacement has taken its place. It's taken me a while to find an excuse to visit Granger & Co, and a girlie catch-up on a Monday evening seemed the perfect occasion.We both went for the catch of the day (in our case John Dory pan-fried whole) followed by the most delicious pavlova which we shared.Everythying about Granger & Co is just right: the food, the ambience, the staff, and it's well worth the price. We went before the current heatwave set in, and now it's probably even more perfect.Can't wait to find an excuse for my next visit.",

    "text": "Feeling a little homesick these past few weeks, and I had decided to meet up with an Aussie friend for brunch on Saturday, and having eaten at Granger & Co back home in Aus, I felt this was the best opportunity to try out Granger & Co here in the UK. I arrived around 11am, and there was a short line, which was moving quite quickly. We ended up being seated not long after 11:15am. I had checked out the menu earlier in the week, and had finally decided on what I was going to order. Mind you, I will have to go back a few times to really try everything I want to. I settled on rice porridge with coconut yoghurt and mango, with an americano, and my friend on the full Aussie breakfast, complete with tomato sauce, and tea. The service was attentive, and there seemed to be plenty of wait staff. Our meal came out quite quickly. However the coffee's came out ever so slowly.My porridge was amazing! It was soo delicious. And the Aussie breakfast looked unreal, the eggs were so creamy!I had ordered a second coffee, which was forgotten, until I asked a second time. Which was a bit of a shame. But overall the experience was enjoyable, and felt like I was home. Perfect experience for the homesickness in me.",

They dont take reservations but they will seat you if you arrive before the rest of your party. I had to try the ricotta banana hotcakes with honeycomb butter because almost every review boasts about how amazing they are. \u00a0You get 3 large puffy hotcakes stacked over half a slice of banana. \u00a0my initial reaction after my first bite was that it tasted and had the texture of raw pancake batter. But as I continued to nosh I began to understand what makes this dish so popular. The texture is due to the ricotta cheese and whipped egg souffle-like batter. \u00a0The hotcakes are extremely fluffy and moist. \u00a0They almost float. What surprised me was that it wasn't as sweet as I imagined it to be (which is good!). The dish is accompanied by a very light maple syrup which doesn't overwhelm and allows you to appreciate the creamy ricotta cheese hotcake. \u00a0This is the most interesting item to order from their breakfast menu. My husband ordered the chili fried egg bacon sandwich on brioche. I could not taste the chili but the brioche bun was very fresh.Definitely a nice place to go for any meal if you want to be in a buzzing dining room filled with posh patrons. Note: there has always been at least one baby screeching each time I've been here.This restaurant is exactly what one would expect it to be like.",

While I wasn't really into a sweet breakfast, had read the reviews of their hotcakes. They didn't disappoint. I could smell the cooked egg as the plate was placed before me. The hotcakes are really puffy and airy not the flat pancakes you'd expect. You don't get that volume unless you whip the egg whites separately. Sure enough saw a some unincorporated egg whites (cooked obviously just wasn't fully incorporated into the batter - no big deal). Some ricotta sprinkled in each hotcake. Didn't really get much added flavor from the ricotta. Really it was all about the light fluffy texture of the hotcakes. Wish I could go back to try more off their menu.",

    "text": "This place has been on my brunch wish list for SO long and finally a few weekends ago we plucked up the courage for the queue (pick a warm, dry day) and headed to Westbourne Grove. We joined it just before 10.30 and were seated by 11am \u00a0- not bad. They seem to have a pretty slick operation but it does make it a bit stressful, being constantly hounded about timings. We were offered 2 seats at the bar so parked up and took the menu (for no reason as I have been studying it for over a year and know it off by heart!). I reallllly couldn't decide what to have but in the end went for the ricotta hotcakes with banana as they sounded so different. My bf went for scrambled eggs on toast and asked for the side of bacon, mushrooms and sausage for \u00a34 to be told it was \u00a34 for ONE of them (yikes at the cost and the lack of clarity!). We both ordered a coffee and a juice. The coffee came quickly but the juice took a further 10 minutes while people who had arrived after us had theirs. The food also took quite a while to come and when it did I was not wowed by the portion size or the presentation. Yes, pancakes are just round and brown but they could have made it look a little pretty with the banana. Instead raw banana was just sliced in two and hidden beneath them (why couldnt they caramelise them and present them nicely?) We were starving so tucked in. The scrambled eggs LOOK amazing but have very little seasoning, the bacon was amazing and the toast was good. My ricotta hotcakes were OK but I didn't think the ricotta added anything to it and I have had fluffier nicer pancakes else where. Overall a huge disappointment and really expensive for what it was - GUTTED (did I mention the OJ was \u00a35 for the smallest glass?). There are still things on the menu I want to try so proooobably will be back but I wish they took bookings/ served breakfast past 12pm on weekends!",

This young lady has impeccable taste so we were not surprised when our lunch here at Granger & Co. turned out to be very, very good.This trendy restaurant located in the heart of the Notting Hill section of London has an upscale clientele and the food is upscale to please their customers.Healthy, clean, lean, organic food that is prepared with great care and finesse. Not only does this food taste good, it looks good as well.We had a Shrimp Burger with fries, Chicken Wiener Schnitzel, a Grain Salad and Chicken meatballs and pasta. Everyone at my table was extremely happy with their choices. They are not stingy either. The portions were ample enough to carry us all through to a late dinner reservation tonight.This was one of our better lunches here in London. We are going to come back this weekend for breakfast an see how they pull this meal off. My money is on them!",

It was so good We all took one of bills specials scrambled eggs or poached eggs with some basic brunch sides. I tasted good. However I think it's pricy for what it is (I needed to add two sides to my scrambled eggs: smoked salmon and avocado). While you would expect that one of these could be included in an egg dish. Overall the service was nice it's comfy and the food quality is good! But need one queue for 40minutes in average to get in ?! Not sure ... Also we had the hotcakes for desert that we shared among three and it was enough !",

    "text": "So, so good. Plan to lineup if you are coming in the morning. I like the lineup. Ask for a take away coffee whilst you wait. They know how to coffee. They are also able to do you a takeaway juice if that's your thing. If you're a solo diner, there is usually a spot at the bar so it will be faster for you to get a place. Good spot to eat on your own... Great people watching. Lots of attractive people eat here...Once you're in, if it's brunch you're in for, then your biggest problem now is committing to something. Everything is great. They have some fresher, healthier options like the fresh aussie, very delicious scrambled eggs and a full Aussie (like a full english but Aussie), ricotta hot cakes or, my favourite, the baked spinach and eggs - get with a side of bacon or av salsa. All the sides are super yummy.If you're there for lunch they have the most amazing salmon and soba noodle dish as well as a raw tuna salad. It's a great place to eat a very nutritious, healthy lunch and still feel completely satisfied. Don't worry, there is also a burger. So much veggie, so much green, so much favour. I don't think you can go wrong.The drinks list is excellent. A slight Australian skew (to be expected) but all in all a complete list of great options. Definitely try a coopers pale if you are feeling like a beer (it's what the South Aussies drink). The juices are also good- I love the green one! Last, but certainly not least, the cakes and muffins are some of the best I have ever seen. It's a very dangerous spot to sit at the bar and stare at those beautiful baked goods. Soooo so tempting. They do take away too.",

    "text": "The hype for Granger & co. is through the roof, the ricotta hotcakes this, the eggs that........The queue of people had obviously been reading the same reviews as me. I don't do queuing but I really wanted to try this place, so we queued. From the very beginning, there was something very off about the guy that served us, he took our order but had to ask us to repeat because, not once did he look at us, his eyes went to the door, the kitchen, the bar, passing folk but never us. I said to my friend, \"I bet he gets the order wrong\". I love being right.When the order came, my dish was wrong, another waiter bought the food to us-which took ages btw and he was very sweet and polite. The original waiter came back and very aggressively almost accused me of ordering the wrongly delivered dish. No apology for his mistake.When the food did arrive, it was admittedly delicious, even with the bitter taste left by the waiter. I had halloumi with egg, hummus, bacon and I love people which uses parsley in a bold fashion. The miso mushrooms were bland though. I also had a hot chocolate which took a good 15 minutes to arrive and was chocolate sauce on the inside of a teeny glass and then filled with hot milk. Not a hot chocolate, nor cool, nor fulfilling the desired promise. Sigh.We ordered the ricotta hotcakes as per hype. But it was terrible, lumpy, bland, boring, weird, yuck.Bill time came and, you guessed it, Mr Charm left the wrong item on the bill....I questioned this and he bought it back over with no apology and the item removed without subbing in the correct item. Now folks, I would usually say something but as this guy was such an ass, I didn't bother. He turned his back on us as we left so justified decision.Overall, its expensive, not worth the hype although it's ego and hipsters will keep it afloat but in any case, my time was ruined. ZERO stars. Never again.",

    "text": "Known for a being a great breakfast/bunch posh spot, we decided to try it for dinner. \u00a0Of course it was busy, service wasn't exactly friendly despite previous reviews, but the decor and space is clean and modern - a nice place to hang out. On first look at the menu it didn't seem all that exciting. \u00a0Yes it's an eclectic mix of Asian, middle eastern and European flavours as the magpie food of modern Australia is, but in all honesty it looked like a random collection of foods with no overarching story. I was pleasantly surprised by my first small plate of miso aubergine, it was small, but brilliantly balanced creating strong umami topped off with little crispy cubes of silken tofu delicately fried to perfection. \u00a0The creamy burrata was great, but in all honesty when is burrata not good and if you can't place a piece of burrata on a plate with some tomatoes then shame on you. Deep fried squid was a tiny plate again but the tempura was excellent, light and crispy though the sweet chilli dipping sauce was a bit generic. \u00a0Korean barbeque chicken was dry and overcooked, both the meat and skin suffered, I would have preferred eating some hot wings from KFC and the gochujang based sauce was poorly balanced. Parmesan crusted chicken schnitzel was so-so, a nice fennel salad went with this, but the coating just went soft and soggy in less than a minute, the chicken meat itself was pretty average. This seems like a plate that hasn't been mastered yet, but is placed on the menu to satisfy the hordes of chicken lovers and for those who want something more European.So, I can see why it's a popular place, a really nice space, with modern food and there were some good plates, but also some really average plates. And at \u00a390 for two people you can eat much better food. \u00a0Style over substance is a bit harsh, but there is a certain group of people who will love this place and another who will wonder what all the fuss is about. \u00a0If you're into the posh west London thing, this is the price you pay. Perhaps a few little tweaks to the foox will make it deserving of it's price tag, but clearly Granger and Co is popular and it's not just about the food. \u00a0I mean who serves labneh without bread??? How do you eat it? But I guess there is probably a high number of people with gluten allergies in this part of London.",

It's a good looking room (pleasant decor, nothing fancy) filled with young good looking people there to be seen in a hip place and enjoy the ambience + soundtrack of moneyed youth's chit chat. It's said to be a favourite amongst Notting Hill yummy mummies, but luckily for us there was not a single crying baby to be heard.We decided to check out the hype and ordered the famous ricotta hotcakes with bananas. They are indeed very fluffy and light, if a bit bland if you prefer stronger flavours; I enjoyed mine. The honeycomb butter is simply delicious and I wish there were more of it. The syrup was quite nice too, not overly sweet but adding some welcome extra sweetness to the cakes. They'll give you three huge cakes and they're quite filling; I am happy I skipped the side dishes as I would be able to finish. I really wanted to sample the beautiful looking cakes, but simply coudn't eat another thing.What I regreted was the hot chocolate: basically they rub a bit of melted choc inside a glass and fill it with hot milk; not a bad idea and it does look nice, but it tastes of warm water with a touch of bitterness. Awful. In fact I would have ordered a latte, but I couldn't find it on the menu... Even though later I did see lattes/cappuccinos on tables, I guess you have to ask? Odd. All in all is a pleasant place with alright food and beautiful clientele to look at. I wouldn't go out of my way for the food alone, and maybe in a few months when the hype dies down a little and I don't have to queue I'll return for that cake I couldn't manage.",

All the staff was super nice and my order was taken quickly. It took quite a while for the food to come out though but I finally received my plate of nice looking pancakes. 3 pancakes stacked on top of two half of a banana and a jug of maple syrup on the side.However the pancakes were barely warm and two out of three were quite dry and barely had any ricotta in them. The third one had much more ricotta and was much better though still pretty cold. I didn't want to wait any longer for another plate and the staff was so busy so I didn't dare to send them back. I think I was just unlucky and that these can be very nice pancakes indeed, but at this price, they should come out perfect everytime.",

After eating a few, they somehow grow on you.I enjoyed my crab and ginger fried rice. Very fragrant and a really large portion. However it came with a strange side dish of egg noodles and chilli sauce, and the noodles tasted a tad stale. Burger was nothing to write home about and the side of fries tasted a bit strange- not sure if it was the oil used or the seasoning on them. \u00a0So overall, the food is ok.Now, the decor and service. We sat near the front, which was really squishy, beside some fire extinguishers and a very precarious light on a cable. \u00a0Wait staff did exactly that- made us wait a really long time for everything, and not particularly responsive.Overall, what would have been an ok, 3 star meal was rendered subpar based on the staff and ambience. I will not return unless an emergency.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were vacationing in London for a few days between Christmas and NYE. We were staying near Hyde Park and had passed this place a few times while exploring the neighborhood on foot. From the outside, it appeared modern, inviting, crowded (always a good sign) and new. In fact it was so new that when we tried searching for reviews online, none had been written yet. Our final evening in town, we decided to give it a shot for a late dinner. I ordered the burger. Safe choice it seemed, but man was I wrong. About halfway into it, I bit into something hard. My girlfriend thought I was just being a wuss. \"It's just a little gristle, can't hurt you.\" I knew it wasn't. I spit out the bite into my napkin and dug through my chewed food to find a piece of glass ... followed by a second piece of glass. I had bitten right through it. The two pieces together were about the size of a dime.I don't even remember what my girlfriend ordered, nor does it matter, because there was GLASS IN MY BURGER.The waiter was nice, but seemed young and inexperienced and therefore completely terrified when we explained to him what had happened. Enter the manager. Her genuine concern was peppered with a hint of skepticism (\"Hmm...we don't even allow glass in our kitchen ... I don't know how this could have happened!\"). Granted London is an expensive city, but I'm not in the habit of carrying around shards of glass in my pocket to scam free meals on vacation. She offered to remake my burger but, needless to say, we had both lost our appetites. In the end, our meal was comped but not our wine. I suppose I would have needed to be gushing blood from my mouth to be comped the entire bill. Perhaps UK society just isn't as litigious as ours here in the States?I sincerely hope they solved the mystery of the origins of the glass. Had we not been one of the last tables of the night, and instead were drawing the attention of a full restaurant, I suspect the incident would have had a severe impact on the early success of this newbie on the block.",

Twice. \u00a0The first time we got there at midday and were told that it would be an hour's wait. \u00a0Yeah, well, screw that!Happened to wake up early this past Sat (new year's resolution still hanging on by a thread!) so made it to Granger & co by 9.30. It was full! \u00a0We managed to nab the last free table. The service was a little pushy when it came to taking orders -- I felt as if they wanted us fed and out ASAP. \u00a0That was, until we had to ask twice for the bill (no pun intended). So, actually, service is just a little scrappy. The servers are rushed off their feet, though.I ordered corn fitters with bacon and a side of avocado salsa; my boyfriend ordered the full Aussie with a sided of sliced avocado; our friend ordered the ricotta hot cakes. \u00a0Good things: corn fritters were tasty and generously 'corny', my boyfriends breakfast was good save the scrambled eggs, our friend's hoecakes were light ands fluffyBad things: measly one thin rasher of pale bacon with my corn fritters (I loathe un-crispy bacon), boyfriend's scrambled eggs were bland, everything too greasy.Cakes perch prettily on the bar counter. \u00a0We asked what flavours they were; waiter didn't know. \u00a0We settled on carrot. \u00a0Again, greasy, greasy. \u00a0Coffee-flavoured icing on carrot cake also just does not work. \u00a0What's wrong with a good ol' vanilla cream cheese frosting?I'd go back just because it's a bright, cheery space, it's convenient and it s nicer than 202 down the road. \u00a0Tom's (also down the road) is better for brunch but tiny so unless you get there super early be prepared to wait. \u00a0Mind you, the wait is horrible for Granger's as well...So my quest continues...*sigh*",

    "text": "This review is for brunch.I would have given this place 3 stars based only on the food. \u00a0However, the ABYSMAL service (and I mean ABYSMAL by London, and even tempted to say Parisian standards) inspired me to downgrade it to 1 star. \u00a0I won't go into the food much, but I will note that the menu is decent, the quality of food is on par with places like Lantana (coffee is not as good though), and the portions are generous. \u00a0Aside from that, the terrible service alone was enough to discourage me from ever returning again.Why was the service at Granger & Co crap? \u00a01. \u00a0We arrived at 11 am on Sunday and queued for something like 45 minutes. \u00a0This would not have been a huge problem if the restaurant was actually busy. \u00a0However, they had more than enough waiters, and we saw tons of empty tables inside. \u00a0I have never been to a restaurant that was so bad at seating people. \u00a0There were at least 6 parties waiting outside, and 3 empty tables at one time inside. \u00a0It took around 10-15 minutes before an empty table was reseated with a new party. This was pretty much the pattern throughout the whole 2-3 hours we were there. \u00a0Note to the hostess: People hate waiting outside, especially when it's freezing cold, so you might want to hurry the f--- up.2. \u00a0Reason #2 was the tipping point for me. \u00a0Around the 40 minute mark in our queue time, we saw the staff finally starting to bring in the next lot to fill the 3 empty tables. \u00a0We counted and saw that we would be able to take the last available table. \u00a0However, there was a group of first class a-holes (originally behind us in line) who were now trying to negotiate their way to the table that was meant for us. \u00a0We thought there would be no way the hostess would allow them to take our table when we and several others had been waiting out in the freezing cold for almost an hour. \u00a0Oops, we were wrong. \u00a0That stupid hostess decided it would be okay to seat them, even though they had originally accepted seats at the bar. \u00a0Later, I realised that this was probably because they knew someone who worked at the restaurant. \u00a0These people looked like total wankers (single people around late 20s/early 30s, bleached blond hair, tons of shopping bags, wearing designer clothes and sunglasses on a CLOUDY DAY), and they actually waved at the queue outside smugly to demonstrate how they were cool enough to get a table before everyone else. \u00a0Yes, you are so cool to allow the families with \u00a0babies and toddlers to freeze outside for that much longer so that you can take a table. \u00a0Shame on you people, seriously shame on you. \u00a0And shame on the hostess for actually yielding to these jerks.Everyone in the queue saw what happened, and there was an uproar. \u00a0By this time, we were seriously pissed off, so some of us went into the restaurant to yell at the hostess. \u00a0She seemed surprised that we were so upset, but our bitching worked, and we eventually were able to push that cheeky party of 3 to a small table and reclaim the table for 4 that was meant for us. \u00a0They looked really upset that they had to share a table for two---that's what you get for thinking you can actually get away with being first class jerks at a brunch place. \u00a0You might get away with that kind of behaviour at a club/bar meant for turkeys, but you need a serious reality check if you think you can get away with it anywhere else. \u00a0Ahhh victory is sweet. \u00a03. \u00a0The waiter got our orders wrong.4. \u00a0It took around 20 minutes from the time we got our bill to the time the waiter actually came around with the card machine. \u00a0Note to the owner: When people are actually willing to pay and leave, you should probably hurry up so that you can seat a new party. \u00a0It would be smarter from a business perspective to allow seated people to wait a little longer for their orders so that other people can leave and new parties can be seated. \u00a0You need to read up on restaurants as a business model. \u00a0My overall recommendation to the owner: Fire your hostess, she sucks at her job. \u00a0In this economy, you can surely find someone better. \u00a0And try to manage your waiters & the wait system better. \u00a0My recommendation to brunch- goers: \u00a0Go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Delicious Australian restaurant, just opened in November 2011, long queues over the weekend that seem justified. Finally a great brunch place in Notting Hill? In spite of the wonderful weekend appeal of Notting Hill, the choice for brunch places is quite limited: Toms is charming but very small with a fresh but unsurprsing menu, 202 is too posh (for me at least) and with a limited choice, The Electric is great but sooo dark, The Tabernacle is great during the summer and with kids but the food is nothing special, etc. Here comes Granger & Co and we were sold on our first visit (in spite of the queues). Compared to other reviewer on Qype I had a fantastic experience but cant compare it to other Granger places as I had never heard of the chef, a kind of Aussie version of Jamie Oliver (or maybe Jamie Oliver is in fact a Brit version of Bill Granger after all). So we liked the bright, light and airy dining room, and the casual all day menu available. All the food we had Aussie breakfast, eggs, hamburger, fritters and pasta) were excellent and still different from our usual family brunches. Maybe it was the Australian feel in fact. The staff was very friendly and our waiter took great care of us, even getting some special pasta made for one of our children who didnt like the sauce on the menu (and only charged \u00a34 for the pasta). So we will be back, the only issue is that the price to pay is a long queue before lunch, not the best way to spend part of Saturday or Sunday but once inside the restaurant it feels well worth it, tasty, friendly, well-designed and good value for money (\u00a355 for 4 brunch, 2 adults and 2 children). A new favourite!",

    "text": "So... I've been waiting to eat at a Bill Granger restaurant ever since he opened bills in sydney - I even considered going there, just to check it out, but it is rather a long way to go for brunch... anyway now that there's one slightly nearer to hand, I managed to fix with friends to go there for brunch - and was very keen to try the signature ricotta hotcakes with banana and honeycomb butter. So first of all, we arrived at 10am on a Sunday and had to wait at lest 50 minutes for a table. Strangely enough when we were eventually seated, there were 3 emoty tables, which seemed a bit odd. Anyway, onto the actual food. The standout dish? The warm banana chocolate chip bread with riicotta which my friends ordered to start. I only had a corner as I wanted to save room for the hotcakes, but it was delicious, melting chocolate, slightly salty ricotta cutting through it...yum. The hotcakes? Well they were OK, light and fluffy, but would have been SO much better if the banana had been grilled with some of that honeycomb butter. Raw banana? Not so much. In fact I left the banana and butter and just had the pancakes on their own with maple syrup. One of my friends ordered the corn fritters, which were good, very fresh, crunchy corn and a decent amount of bacon and tomato salsa. I was happy to see they serve Allpress espresso coffee, my favourite kind. I would go back, but on a weekday when the lines aren't so long, and I'd have that banana bread again.",

On week days that might take 10-20 minutes, on the weekend you will have to wait 30 minutes at least.The service is great, very friendly and welcoming! Once you're seated, you're in heaven! The menu contains about ten dishes. A quite perfect selection for any breakfast lover! My breakfast of choice on that day was a \"Full Aussie\": Salmon, Spinach, Eggs and Tomatoes. The food is fresh and outstanding! The coffee is also great! If possible, I would definitely come back every choice I get! Such a beautiful place!",

I can't imagine what it's like on the weekends at brunch time. Husband had the corn fritters and I had the scramble and toast which I added avocados to. It totally hit the spot and the toast had a square of the best salted butter I've ever had in my life. (How am I gonna go back to the ho hum butter back home?) the carrot cake we had for dessert - amazing. I regretted not getting the ricotta pancakes. They looked perfectly fluffy and excellent but this gives me an excuse to come back again the next time I'm in London.",

The doctorate pancakes were just ok but they also do a kids size which isn't on the menu. The back bacon and scrambled eggs were great and the coffee sublime.

I went to Granger to have my first meal of the day, and suppose, I needed more coffee. Had I been served a bigger cup, it would've been amazing!! My better-half ordered the scrambled eggs, which was accompanied by two slices of sour dough toast \u00a0with a side of bacon. That was another tasty dish. I'm not sure how they prepare their eggs, they look like they're whipped, sonic you want more txt ute in your eggs, this won't be for you. If you like the whipped, creamy, airy-like eggs, this may be to your liking. I love the ambience--very euro-posh and artisan/modern. I love the high ceilings and cozy feel.

I got the Tuna Poke that was delicious but portions were small. One in our group got their burger which was very tender. The ingredients were all really fresh and flavorful. The food was good, however they're so busy and bordering on being short staffed at peak hours. The overall experience did not live up to the hype.",

The insanity starts with the 2 sisters spending an all nighter catching up on \"The Good Wife\". 4am trip to primrose hill to see the sunrise and view the Balloon Regatta. (They look like waterspots in the pictures this dreary morning) \u00a0Walk across to the zoo where only the zebras were outside.Nothing open at 6am in the area for breakfast. Came back to Hyde park. Lots of dogs and birds, even saw the early morning swimmers at the Lido, but nothing open even in Kensington at 7am for breakfast.Finally with an 8am opening time, a few more options popped up on the screen.Grangers has been on my wish list for awhile. We reached at 8:15 and despite its 60+ covers, there was still a queue outside.Since it was just 2 of us, we were seated very quickly as majority of the waiting clientele seemed to be large groups of 4 and more.We had to wait a bit for our order to arrive, but we didn't mind. We avoided the highly recommended coffee so as to be able to sleep on arriving home. But the home made almond milk was great. (Don't tell anyone, but I added a bit of sugar to my milk)The coconut bread was oh so good, almost like a dense tea cake. Toasted with a bit of salted butter & o was in heaven. Yummy bacon & chipolatas & jasmine tea smoked salmon. The mushrooms were brilliant. The harissa we ordered for flavouring, really want needed as every dish had lovely flavours of its own.Packed up some more coconut bread to bring home for tea when we woke up. Definitely have to go back for the ricotta hot cakes & the coffee & try their lunch/dinner menus too.Loved the place!",

We ordered the scrambled eggs & sourdough (honestly, to die for!) and I got the specialty daily donut and my husband the specialty daily muffin. Everything we ordered was delicious. Service was quick, helpful, and friendly. The atmosphere is a little plain but is modern and clean. Definitely will be back!",

The corgettes were quite nice, kind of a tempura fried so they were light and lovely. The shrimp burger was honestly bland. It came with a spicy sauce, but it didn't really help it at all.

I had the \"miso aubergine, fried tofu & shiso\" for starters. It was the perfect size, enough to bring on your hunger for more, though not too much that you're full for your main. The fried tofu was lightly fried and not oily at all. It was a glorious combination. Main course I had the \"turmeric spiced chicken, slaw, peanuts,lime & coconut dressing\" - very light, tangy & refreshing. The environment itself is buzzy, casual and lively.

    "text": "Literally, it was one of the best brunches I have had. My friends and I went for a pretty late brunch after studying in a coffee shop. There was a bit of a line, but we were seated quite quickly. They have a lot of tables as well as high stool chairs surrounding the bar. The aesthetic of the place? Love. It's kind of a minimalist farm chic(?) style. There were a lot of flowers, white wooden floors, and large windows that made the entire restaurant bathed in sunlight. Basically, the atmosphere was perfect for an English brunch. Ok, let's talk food. We ordered the soft shell crab kimchi fried rice and the ricotta banana hotcakes. The kimchi fried rice was a punch of flavor with a poached egg, generous portions of kimchi, and chorizo slices. The dish also came with a lot of cucumbers and assorted veggies to cut through the flavor. (minor thing: the soft shell crab could be a tad more crispy in my opinion). But GUYS, the STAR of the show was definitely the hotcakes. \u00a0Absolutely divine. They are not like your typical British crepe-thin pancakes or the American shortstack, they kind of remind me of the pillowy Japanese style pancakes. They were so warm and fluffy. There was a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top, and fresh banana slices on the side. The pancakes came with this honey butter and syrup. We also ordered some of their homemade sodas: hibiscus and the ginger ale. The hibiscus was, by far, my favorite: not too sweet with a tang of lime juice. The ginger ale had freshly grated ginger in it. All in all, my favorite brunch place in one of my favorite neighborhoods in London and also near my go-to study cafe to boot. The atmosphere is perfectly lovely for a brunch Sunday. The place kind of reminds me of a spot you would go after having your summer book club meeting where you proceed to continue your discussion while sipping on some iced tea. The food is great, and the waitress was friendly. Highly recommend. Post. Script. Also the check came with this adorable postcard. The aesthetic is spot on.",

    "text": "Am going to divide my review into two categories: 1-Professionalism.It needs an experienced manager to manage the restaurant professionally. Professionalism starts with greetings until leaving the restaurant. In my opinion, the experience itself is a crucial part and also, of course, the quality of food. We are waiting in line to be seated. Then the manager wasn't pleasant to ask us to Make away for the tables outside the restaurant. I saw the same treatment happened with sheep on farms. Our turn comes up then she asked us where do you prefer to sit? We told her inside since it was cold. \u00a0The Waitresses came \" without saying welcome to the restaurant\" she just poured the water and gave us the menu and left. \u00a0I've found some black dots inside the glass, I thought it is in the glass itself but I've scratched it, and it was DIRTY. I've asked her politely to change the glass because it has dirt in it..... Then she starts holding the glass and starts placing her fingerprints and started to question me that there is no dirt, professionally she supposed to say \" I apologize for that, let me change your glass.\" I told the manager that the waitress she was arguing when I told her to change the cup. Moreover, the manager didn't apologize for it. \u00a0After I paid, the didn't even say thanks for coming.2-Food.The food wasn't WOW that made me take Uber from Knightsbridge to Notting Hill for it. I've ordered the great scrambled egg. The plate it has one slice of toast cut in half and nub of butter between, scrambled egg, and a leaf of spinach.***A waste of Money, energy, and time.",

I have no freaking idea how they get their scrambled eggs to do that fluffy twirly thing. I mean, what the heck? And they also have rose harissa as a side, which was mind blowing. I put it on the toast and eggs and I was so happy. Seriously guys it's so good. The ricotta pancakes are all the rave and for good reason, because they're totally out of this world!!! no idea how they make those suckers either!!!!! They're fluffy and soft and creamy and delicious and massive! I feel like many brunch places offer food that wouldn't be terribly hard to make yourself at home, but Granger & Co is at a totally other level. You know it too because there's always a line. We went here at 8:30am on a Saturday and we got a seat but it was SO BUSY by the time we left. Service was great, the place is lovely looking, and the food is absolutely freaking magic delicious. Yes, it's magic delicious I'm not taking it back.",

However, the food was below my expectation. In my opinion, it was overrated. My friends ordered the hotcake, and avocado toast, which didn't give us the WoW moment at all. I ordered the chili fried egg roll which was basically a burger... I came from US and I had better brunch than this. IHOP's pancake is even better than the hotcake. I miss chicken and waffle now!!",

I had the Parmesan-crumbed Chicken Schnitzel, Creamed Corn and Fennel Slaw. My wife had the Sticky Chili Belly Pork. We shared the best Bananas Foster of all time (as hip bistros do, this little slice of dessert heaven is no longer on the menu).",

There was already a line when we arrived at 9:30, however because there was only two of us, we got seated at the bar very quickly. It looked like the remainder of the people in line with us also got seated pretty quickly as well, so don't be intimidated by the line! We ordered the ricotta hot cakes and the sunny fried eggs with a side of bacon. The hot cakes were really good, but I just wish the banana that came with had been cut and put on top. Not left whole underneath. The maple syrup was very good as well. The eggs were ok, the bread was very good and the bacon was a bit dry. All in all it was a very solid meal. My husband really enjoyed chatting with the barista, and even though they were very busy, she chatted with us throughout our meal. Oh, and the chai tea is really good! All in all would return and try other locations.",

    "text": "Sadly having now already visited Granger and mentioned our not so great experience to friends, they've informed me that they could have told me that...wish they had, to have saved my time!We ventured here last weekend, after having it bookmarked for ages, around brunch time on Saturday. \u00a0We were seated quickly, but at a not so great cramped table, when there were plenty of better options, but rather than being difficult, we took it...took awhile to get menus, but when we did we ordered quickly - a bloody for me (extra spicy), a salad with variations for my boyfriend.The bloody arrived as clearly just tomato juice (plus hopefully vodka), but nothing else...so my boyfriend went up to the bar to ask for worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, pepper, hot sauce.....which once added, made a much better bloody. \u00a0My boyfriend wasn't too wild about his salad at first, but said it grew on him.Unfortunately, things got worse from there. \u00a0After sitting for ages saying we were ready to close out, the bill still hadn't arrived....so we asked our server again...she again said ok, then i see her clearing a table behind us (the place was pretty empty at that point, so no need to rush to clear and set tables)....so after another 5 or so minutes, we ask her again for the bill....she says ok...then i see her clearing ANOTHER table, setting ANOTHER table...and still no bill. \u00a0This process continued, and we ultimately asked her four times, and about 15 minutes (or more) to get our bill...for a salad and a bloody.At that point, we were in a rush to get elsewhere, which ultimately got us there over an hour later than we'd planned. \u00a0Plus, when she FINALLY brought the bill she's all trying to shoot the shit with us (\"anything fun planned for tonight?\"...um, now we'll be hauling ass to get somewhere in time). \u00a0I get that service in London isn't spectacular, but when its \"optional\" 12.5% gratuity on top of the regular included gratuity, I'd really hope it doesnt take four requests and multiple table bussings and resettings in between to get your simple bill.Sadly, friends from Australia living in london told me it was very disappointing (the ones who could have saved me my time had I learned this prior to my visit), and that they had rushed there, upon hearing about the \"aussie chef,\" and left equally, if not more, disappointed.",

I ordered a hot chocolate, which was uniquely served in a glass so you could see patches of chocolate on the inside of the glass. I was also so excited to try the ricotta hotcakes after hearing so many people rave about them! They. Were. Amazing. Light, fluffy, just the right amount of sweetness, and dripping with honeycomb butter (yum) and maple syrup. The portions were generous and I ate as much as I physically could but still had a little leftover. Both of my friends ordered the same thing and they were equally obsessed with the hotcakes but unfortunately that meant we didn't try anything else on the menu. I highly recommend coming here for brunch, all of the food looked delicious, the staff was friendly, and the wait is well worth it.",

    "text": "A phrase popped into my head as I was crunching away on their homemade cereal--cereal that was so hard to chew, that by the time I gave up trying, my upper jaw was experience exhaustion tremors. That phrase is: mediocrity abounds. And not just at this place, but at most breakfast places on Westbourne Grove. Or maybe it's just something about this space. Pix before it was no good either.The space itself is calm and airy with its buttery walls and architecturally interesting wood and wicker chairs. The bar is where it was when this place was still Pix, but it now has a neutral wood finish--very Scandinavian-looking. We were sat in a corner and then forgotten about for about 20 minutes. Well, that's not completely true; fresh-squeezed orange juice and my flat white came before then, but then there was waiting. We were busy discussing life plans, so I can't say for sure how much times passed, but I did notice after awhile that the three tables around us had been filled with occupants, who showed up after us and had their orders taken before us. After managing to flag down our waiter, who took our order--for me: the homemade cereal with yoghurt and honey, for the hubs: the gravlax with 'curd' on rye--there was more waiting. It was a solid half-hour of pure waiting. At that point, I was praying to all things holy that the food would be worth the wait. It wasn't. Damn! As I mentioned earlier, the cereal was so far beyond crunchy, I thought I might break a molar. And then they brought some milk for the cereal, and it didn't get any less crunchy. How the hell is that scientifically possible? A sad dollop of yoghurt with honey was served alongside. The gravlax was the least smoked fish I've ever encountered. And the curd, oh lord, the curd... where did it come from and what beast could have possibly produced such tasteless milk? Seriously, it didn't taste like anything. I'm a big believer in the power of salt, and even salt could not revive this curd. Between the service and the food, I can't say I'll ever go back. I imagine it will stay open only because of its weekend breakfast option and the crowd that frequents this part of town. For some people it's more about the socialising than the food. Unfortunately, I prefer good food, and there are other places in Notting Hill that do it better.",

I was sitting at the bar planning for trip around Europe, drinking their good selection of beers. I didn't feel bothered about sitting by myself at all because the staff are so nice. It wasn't overly busy in the afternoon, somewhere between lunch and dinner. I've seen it completely packed every time I've walked passed too, which is another indication that people may be more inclined to write bad reviews over good ones. As far as hospitality in London goes in London, Granger & Co is a step above the rest, which I think is a really important point given just at about every restaurant in London is identically traditional.I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who appreciates quality.",

I also had a bloody mary which fell slightly short of expectations, but it was still decent.

    "text": "We came here on a Wednesday at noon and there still seemed to be a queue. We waited for about 20 minutes before we were seated to a pleasant and airy place. The atmosphere was lively but not too loud. We looked at the lunch menu (which served Brunch items) and everything looked delicious! The definite winner on the menu were the Ricotta Hot Cakes! They were perfectly sweet, topped with maple syrup and served with Bananas, but not too overwhelming. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and satisfying, and had quite an interesting texture (I think they're made with milk). Definitely a must for brunch. Their Greek yoghurt and fruit bowl was excellent and light. Overall, the food was delicious and not overbearing or heavy. A great place for brunch for sure!",

I tried the Fresh Aussie, which comes with smoked salmon, poached eggs, and avocado, all of which are my favourite brunch foods! My Aussie friend also recommended the Ricotta hotcakes, which is apparently a must-have item here.",

Spaghetti with artichoke, mint, and lemon and a side of kale sauteed with chili and lemon. Deee-lish. Warm and lively vibe, even during the day - it just puts me in a good mood.",

    "text": "This restaurants is one of those hipstery places full of yuppies having brunch. So it's quite nice because let's face it, yuppies are not dumb, they like nice places. White tables, white floor, white windows and white bar create a great room, although tables are cramped and it was jam packed.The food itself was OK, good quality but nothing special except for the dessert, a pear crumble with hot custard wich was simply amazing. The rest was very fresh but the apettizer and main I ordered had the same sauce and I had trouble finding where the Australian cuisine was (but what is Australian cuisine anyways?).Service could be greatly improved and most of them seemed indifferent towards anybody in the restaurant. Maybe they get a bonus for not smiling, who knows. The host was very nice and tried to accomodate everybody in the queue, however at some point there were 5 tables empty inside and a bunch of people queueing oustide.Overall, this place makes for a good experience and the food is worth giving a try. Maybe next time I'll just come for tea and cakes.",

    "text": "One of my top brunch places! Yes there is a line on weekends around brunch time but what can you expect it is well known and it is in Notting Hill. The line is worth the wait and it actually goes by pretty fast.The menu has many options and interesting combinations such as corn fritters, ricotta hotcakes, quinoa falafel salad, and different egg dishes.I got the scrambled eggs with bread (you can choose the type of break if you ask) with sides of sliced avocado and tomato. Let me tell you right now the eggs are a-ma-zing. So creamy and filling. They must put a ton of cream in there. Also had the green juice, small size for the price, nothing fantastic but good and refreshing.Lots of families, couples, groups of friends - a little loud to my taste but it is the weekend I guess.In a nutshell: best scrambled eggs award",
