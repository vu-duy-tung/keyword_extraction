    "text": "Royal China, as a posh Chinese restaurant, certainly looks the part with dark panels for the walls, low lighting, glass topped walls between dining sections, gold-plated cutlery andwaiters/waitresses dressed to the nines. If only their food lived up to these expectations! For our meal, we started off with some wonton soup. The portion size was definitely not the biggest I've ever had and therefore I was expecting something special in the wonton itself. Well, though I wouldn't go so far as to say it was horrible, it was nothing special. We then moved on to our main course of Lobster Noodles (with ginger spring onion) with a side of bak choy in garlic. The Lobster Noodle is apparently one of Royal China's signature dishes so once again I was expecting something stunning. The lobster itself certainly looked good but was let down by the noodle and overall taste. The sweetness and succulence of the lobster was let down by the fairly bland ginger spring onion sauce. I could barely taste the ginger and the only time I could get the flavour was when I was chewing on the gigantic ginger pieces! The noodles also failed to absorb any of the juices of the dish and in fact I would even say that I felt the noodles cheapened the dish's overall appeal. I hate to give Royal China negative press as the only other time I've been in here was for the dim sum (which was pretty good if on the expensive side) but sadly it was a thumbs horizontal for me tonight.",

The food itself is pretty good as well, serving some deliciously authentic Dim Sum dishes. The place has some excellent service as well, with the Waiters literally waiting on you hand and foot (the place was reasonably empty so they gave us alot of precedence) but, perhaps as a downside, the atmosphere is a little flat. It looks like you should be scared of dropping food or talking and laughing above a whisper (especially when empty!). A decent place, but not particularly my cup of tea. Look for some of the New Year offers and the Winter menu's they advertise on the front of the restaurant!",

You can order a few different types of dim sum (my favorite was the chueng fun with prawns), a pot of tea, and they even have dessert dim sum (if I remember right what I had was a poppy seed filled dumpling rolled in peanuts and served warm). And it's only a block away from Hyde Park, so when you're done eating, you can walk it off with a stroll around Serpentine Lake. Beautiful.",

    "text": "Authentic Chinese cuisine in London. I went here with a group of friends; and the four of us got a selection of dim sum plates to share, and found we couldn't manage the main courses as we were so full and satisfied after our starters. The food is well cooked and of a good quality and fresh, delivered to the tables promptly by friendly, polite and efficient staff. We had the classic items such as Sui Mai and crispy duck, which we had served shredded, with pancakes, cucumber, spring onions and plum/hoi sin sauce so we could make our own wraps, and the amazing steamed dumplings and cheung fun. Having been so impressed by this visit, I did return (on numerous occasions) and the main courses are just as impressive, with a good value for money. Again, I tend to go for classic dishes such as sweet and sour prawns with rice or roasted duck but I have never had a bad experience and it's the best restaurant on a street which has many Chinese establishments in close proximity.",

    "text": "Royal China @ Queensway(Pics at The London Foodie)I have been coming to Royal China (RC) for the last 12 years, and have nearly always enjoyed my dim sum there. My preferred branch is their flagship restaurant on Queensway, and the only place where I can have one of my most loved dim sum dishes \"Baked Seafood Rice in Creamy Portuguese Sauce\". Hakkasan is another favourite dim sum joint, however I find myself going less frequently to the West End as the years go by. Dim sum at Hakkasan is a completely different ball game (just as good but in a different way), and about 50% dearer.I went to Royal China last Sunday on 27th December 09 and was a bit surprised to find the place with no queue at 1pm. On the one hand, I was pleased that I would not have to wait for a table (RC does not take bookings for dim sum at weekends), but on the other, I felt that it lacked the crazy and vibrant atmosphere seen at the weekends. Staff were also rather uninterested, looking tired and sometimes being almost brusque. I was surprised to experience this considering RC charges 12.5% for service charges, and the level of service is usually good. Royal China's black and gold d\u00e9cor is surprisingly elegant. Despite the lack of windows, the Queensway branch does not feel oppressive but comfortable and roomy.The most successful dim sum dishes we ordered were:\"Prawn & Chive Dumplings\" @ \u00a33.15 - these were as good as ever with the rice wrapper being silken and very delicate and the chives filling delicious.\"Pork and Radish Dumplings\" @ \u00a32.65 - I love white radish (daikon), and the addition of peanuts makes this one of my favourite dumplings.\"Glutinous Rice in Lotus Leaf\" @ \u00a33.50 - with a delicious filling of chicken and mushrooms, encased in sticky rice, and wrapped up in lotus leaves, this steamed dim sum is stodgy but well flavoured.\"Royal China Cheung Fun\" @ \u00a33.60 - I normally order the prawn version but as a friend wanted to try the beef cheung fun, we opted for this dish which contains one of each, prawn, beef and char siu pork. As usual, the cheung fun wrapper was delicate, silken and contrasted beautifully with the meaty fillings.\"Ho Fun Noodles with Pork and Enoki Mushrooms\" @ \u00a38 - I hardly ever have noodles with my dim sum, however I was glad that we order it. It was an excellent dish and accompanied our other dim sum choices well.\"Baked Seafood Rice with Creamy Portuguese Sauce\" @ \u00a39.60 - I haven't yet discovered what this yellow creamy sauce is made from but it is utterly scrumptious, to the point that I dream about it. Meaty scallops, prawns, squid and fish are mixed with egg fried rice and topped with the creamy Portuguese sauce. A \"must\" on any visits to RC Queensway.The less successful dim sum dishes we ordered were:\"Prawn & Coriander Dumpling\" @ \u00a32.65 - the rice wrapper was unusually thick on this occasion and I struggled to taste any coriander in the dumpling. \"Roast Pork Bun\" @ \u00a32.65 - I love this and, as with Cheung Fun and Seafood Rice, order them on every visit. This time, the dumplings had considerably shrunk in size and the char siu pork filling was rather ungenerous.\"Yam Paste & Pork Dumplings\" @ \u00a32.65 - I ordered this in error (I had meant to order the pan fried turnip paste with dried meats which is sensational) and unluckily they were rather greasy and nothing special.\"Fried Mixed Meat Dumpling\" @ \u00a32.65 - again this was slightly greasy and lacking in filling. I struggle to find anything positive to comment on this one.\"Roast Pork Puff\" @ \u00a32.65 - I normally enjoy these triangular beauties similar to Brazilian & Portuguese snacks, but unfortunately this was another disappointing choice as the puffs were served stone cold and tasted a bit tired.I normally come out of RC feeling really pleased with the food and overall experience. I have to admit that on this occasion, I was disappointed as some of the dishes were not as good as previously and the staff had a tired and unfriendly look about them. I still enjoyed the Baked Seafood Rice, the Cheung Fun and a couple of other steamed dumplings though so I hope that coming 2010, RC will pick up again and standards will go back to where they were.The total bill came to \u00a374.40 including service and Chinese tea for 4 people @ \u00a31.20 per person. At \u00a318.60 per person I believe this is still a good value meal in London.Verdict - Variable quality dim sum and unfriendly staff made my latest visit to Royal China a disappointing one. Some star dishes and very reasonable prices warrant a \"revisit\" which I will report in the very near future.",

Slap bang in Queensway, this is a really decent place to go for dim sum, especially for a nice sunny Sunday lunch (be sure to pre-book), in which afterwards you can walk it off in the picturesque Hyde Park. Settle down with a pot of Chinese tea (Jasmine is always a good choice), and order a few dim sum dishes such as the prawn and chive dumpling, roast pork buns (always a must), spare ribs in black bean sauce, if your daring the chicken feet in black bean sauce is good, but not for the squeamish. Be sure to order egg tarts as they make them really well here. Peking duck served with pancakes, spring onion, cucumber and hoisin sauce (oyster sauce) is popular, and made just right, where the meat is tender and the pancakes hot. I almost always order crispy fried noodles with beef and capsicum. There's just something about the deep fried grease of the noodles I just crave.Royal China has a real lively buzz to the place. Like many Chinese restaurants it's loud and there are always waiters rushing around here and there trying to fulfill everyones' needs.",

I suggest the morning glory dish (saut\u00e9ed veggies in garlic), roast pork buns, and the spare ribs in black bean sauce. For two people, the bill came out to 40 quid.

Fried Mixed Meat Dumpling @ \u00a32.65 \u00a0again this was slightly greasy and lacking in filling. I struggle to find anything positive to comment on this one. Roast Pork Puff @ \u00a32.65 - I normally enjoy these triangular beauties similar to Brazilian & Portuguese snacks, but unfortunately this was another disappointing choice as the puffs were served stone cold and tasted a bit tired. I normally come out of RC feeling really pleased with the food and overall experience. I have to admit that on this occasion, I was disappointed as some of the dishes were not as good as previously and the staff had a tired and unfriendly look about them. I still enjoyed the Baked Seafood Rice, the Cheung Fun and a couple of other steamed dumplings though so I hope that coming 2010, RC will pick up again and standards will go back to where they were. The total bill came to \u00a374.40 including service and Chinese tea for 4 people @ \u00a31.20 per person. At \u00a318.60 per person I believe this is still a good value meal in London. Verdict \u00a0Variable quality dim sum and unfriendly staff made my latest visit to Royal China a disappointing one. Some star dishes and very reasonable prices warrant a revisit which I will report in the very near future.",

The restaurant itself actually reminds me of something you might see back in the big country, it's all lacquered black paint, mirrors, gold leaf and minimal designs of typical scenes.We went last on a Sunday evening and when we arrived at 9pm we had to order pretty quickly as they were closing soon. We ordered some classics like Cantonese duck and barbequed pork which were really good quality as well as some tofu and beef dishes - also very nice. I have to say the staff were a bit brusque and didn't really help too much when we asked whether a whole duck would be enough for 5. Apparently she couldn't say as she didn't know how much we would eat. I can't help thinking this is only a fair comment if you have only ever seen other people get their nutritional intake via an intravenous drip in the mainline and have no conception roughly of what average size portions look like to average size people. Coming from a waitress with no obvious needle in her arm or bag of liquid vitamins behind her this seems unlikely. Having gone through all that though, I'd still go back. The food is really very good.",

But I can assure you that the dim sum here is still a step up from what you'll get at some Chinatown restaurants. For around 12-15 pounds per person, you can get a filling meal of pure dim sum. Normally, I'd get the prawn har gau and shiu mai. When I go with my friends, I tend to be there at 10.30 am for no reason, and I will always see that there are people there already waiting for it to open at 11am. But good food deserves this.",

Ha gow needs more shrimp differentiation and glutinous wrapping. Cheung feng needs more feng. I will say that the chicken feet were maarrrrvelous. There is also no gai lan on the menu but it exists if you ask for it. Everything was missing its usual dipping sauce but maybe this is just a different choice in presentation?There are no reservations for weekend dim sum but the turn over is pretty quick so you will likely not have to wait more than 30 min.

Well, there was no need - we had ordered quite a variety of dishes and they all arrived within 15 minutes.A whole steamed seabass had sweet flesh enhanced by soy sauce and liberal sprinkling of coriander and ginger over the top. Golden crispy fried chicken had moist tender flesh. Crispy shredded beef produced shards of delightfully crispy beef in a tangy and sweet sauce. My friend Tom ordered the unexpected hit of the evening - aubergine stuffed with pork in black bean sauce.The service was fast, efficient and attentive. Have a deserved 5 stars, Royal China!",

There's a different menu, but there's no wait and the food is just as delicious. Also, it's friendly to vegetarians: there's a prix fixe menu just for them.

    "text": "Review for dim sum only.In 1999, I came to London after spending two months in France. I was craving Chinese food \"from back home\" (read: dim sum and Cantonese cuisine). \u00a0I asked to be taken to the best dim sum restaurant in London and I ended up at Royal China on Queensway. \u00a0I remember the food as being very good and comparable to dim sum in San Francisco.Fast forward ten years. \u00a0I went to Royal China for lunch today. The dim sum here has held up very well. \u00a0I've had dim sum in several London Chinatown restaurants in the past ten years, but RC's quality is far superior.Pork dumplings in chili sauce, roast pork cheung fun (BBQ pork rice noodle rolls to San Franciscan dim sum eaters), beef dumplings (steamed beef meatballs to San Franciscans), crispy spring rolls, chicken feet and pork spareribs steamed rice, and a pot of pu-erh tea set me back \u00a320.70 (including VAT and service). \u00a0Yes, you pay for the quality here.",

They exemplify the Chinese efficiency, and I find their attempt at being \"upscale\" charming - similar to other Asian restaurants that use decorations that Western places would consider probably slightly tacky :)",

Sunday's get slammed for brunch/lunch hours. Seems everyone was here on that Sunday! No big deal, we chatted outside for a bit. The food was very good! Being so busy, a few things were incorrectly served but immediately remedied. This staff seems more than capable of these very large crowds! Kudos to them. Overall, I'd give the food a 8/10. I'd likely return! Prices weren't bad and the quality was definitely there.",

We arrived there just after 2pm and joined the long queue.Our visit yesterday did not start well. \u00a0Within a minute after our order, Prawn Cheung Fun and Fried Squid Paste arrived and they were just warm. \u00a0Cheung Fun was below standard to begin with - nothing special at all and lacked flavour/texture. \u00a0We could taste the fresh squid in the latter, but they really should have hot in temperature. \u00a0The rest of our order arrived piping hot, thank God! \u00a0Prawn Dumpling, Roast Pork Bun, Glutonous Rice in Lotus Leaves were all packed with flavour and we could taste the fresh ingredients throughout. \u00a0They were just flawless.The service was well organised in a way - as soon as the diners left, someone cleared the table, \u00a0someone else set the table and person in charge of seating guided the new diners in. \u00a0The manager remembered us from the past (long time ago) and brought us a pot of hot water (we used to bring Rooibosch tea). However the other aspect of the service was very poor. \u00a0They were just like robots that were programmed to ignore our requests and I had to ask four different people to get Chilli Oil; the same lovely manager came to a rescue again. \u00a0To be honest, the prices are on the higher side and I am so used to the lovely Dim Sum you can get in San Francisco at a fraction of the price. \u00a0I juts don't understand why they are so expensive in this country. \u00a0Considering the portion, it is hard to fill up with less than 4 dishes per person. \u00a0They also add 13% service charge, so it can be an expensive snack rather than a meal.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Royal China Restaurant twice now and I have to say that's it's some of the best Chinese food I've had anywhere. The first time I dined there was in Oct 2013. The most recent time was October 1, 2014.Three things strike you when you enter the restaurant. The first is the size. It's large by almost any standard, but particularly by London restaurant standards. The second thing is that the menu is large and diverse. Plenty to choose from no matter your dietary restrictions. The final thing is that the restaurant is full of Asian people eating there. That's got to be a good sign right? (That's not racist for me to say, is it? I would say the same thing about any sort of ethnic food where lots of people from that ethnicity were eating. Gosh, maybe that's racist too? It's too bad that people are so reserved on the Internet that I'll probably never know!)Anyway, back to the food. My most recent meal (shared with a co-worker) consisted of the following:Special Hor D'oeuvres Plate - Ordered by my dinner partner, we were both stunned by the side of this dish. It was huge. Definitely enough for 2-3 people. Most of the offerings were items that I don't or can't eat, but the reports I got was that everything was very good.Crispy Beef in Taro Nest - Absolutely delicious. I'm so happy when something is advertised as crispy and it actually is crispy. This beef dish tasted delicious and was fantastically crispy.Sweet and Sour Chicken - Very good. Perhaps not so different from Sweet and Sour Chicken I've had at other top-not restaurants. Like the Crispy Beef, the entire serving was demolished. Vegetables in Crispy Noodles - If I'm eating at a Chinese restaurant, guaranteed I'm eating this dish along with the others. The noodles were unique to me. Thin, short and crispy. I liked them. Fried Toffee Bananas - Let's see, bananas deep friend in batter and then drenched in a sweet toffee sauce? Um, yes please. In addition to these items I had two glasses of wine, and my co-worker had a diet coke and ice cream. The total bill came to (L)87.12 or about $144, including a 13% gratuity which was automatically added to the bill. Service was attentive and polite. The restaurant is attractive and clean. We both walked out full and happy. The same experience I had on my last trip to London a year ago.It's a bit of a conundrum, isn't it? I mean, London has tens of thousands of restaurants to explore. I'm there once or twice a year. It feels a bit like I should never eat at the same restaurant twice. But then again, when you're hungry and want a reliable meal that you know is also going to be delicious, why risk going somewhere new? At least that's the argument that won out this time. Ultimately, our experience did nothing to dissuade me from a three-peat visit on a future trip.",

Royal China used to be our place for 'fancier' dim sum but the last few times I've been here it's been NYEHHHHH.The har gow, siu mai and lo mai gai were good but the cheong fun was mushy (clearly way too long in the steamer) & the cha siew sou was stodgy and not flakly at all! It was so bad all four of us cringed after biting into it :( (this genuinely saddens me because I honestly don't understand how an institution like Royal China could be so sub-standard).Although disappointing, that was all fine and well but when our guo tie arrived, everything fell apart. Not only was the skin thick and 'unfried' (only small spots on either side were browned / or should I say charred.. uh, what?) the meat was so pink! I'm fine having my pork rare-ish, but this I passed on.Reasonably, we sent it back, only for the waitress to pull the most sour face, drag two colleagues over and patronisingly insist it was fine! Yes yes, we may not be from Hong Kong or Southern China per se but we certainly are cantonese so don't treat us like idiots, saying 'this is how it's done' like we don't know what *real* dim sum is, or what cooked meat looks like for that matter. Unsurprisingly, its replacement wasn't any better but we ate it anyway because well, you gotta pick your battles! Life goes on..This was a real downer and after numerous average-to-bad experiences, I'm writing Royal China off for good. I acknowledge that some (most?) Chinese restaurants offer service with an attitude but you can't have that and meh food! IT'S THE UNWRITTEN RULE! Well, I guess they really don't care so long as they get your money zzzz.",

The chefs are obviously good at what they do.The problem is the people who serve the food to you. If you hold a teapot in the air for 5 minutes (we timed it) you expect someone to at least acknowledge you in that time even on a busy Saturday. If you then turn on a strobe light on your mobile phone and wave it around for 2 minutes to attract attention while people at the surrounding tables all laugh, you expect some kind of acknowledgement.And when someone finally arrives, and you tell them you were waiting for so long, you don't expect them to say \"well, we are busy!\" in an angry tone of voice. You also then don't expect the manager to back them up without even so much as an apology for it.So to summarise, go here if you want tasty dim sum and have lots of time to kill waiting around for useless service. But if you have that much time to kill, get the tube to their Canary Wharf branch instead!",

Price is decent, staff is friendly, although arriving early is highly suggested despite the large venue - it gets filled up quickly!",

Everything was very very good -- for instance, I could tell that the prawns in all the dimsum were really fresh. Service was prompt as well. On average, things took no more than 10-15mins to be served. Ambience was clean and spacious, which I very much appreciated as I don't often like the crowded, less hygienic places in the name of \"authenticity.\" Hence, a good place for any occasion. Would definitely go back!",

    "text": "I've wanted to come here for ages, but it took me a long time to get around to it! They say the best Chinese cuisine in London is to be found outside of Chinatown, and Royal China is one of the biggest names in town. We arrived around 11:30 AM on a Sunday and found ourselves in a short queue, but the time estimate was 15-20 minutes and they were pretty accurate with that. We were seated at a round table in the middle of the enormous banquet style hall, and ordered of a menu with pictures (I suppose London real estate is too expensive to have the walkways needed to have dim sum on trolleys).We put in an order for 6 dishes, with all of my favorites, and they came out rather quickly. The food was very authentic and well executed. We ran into problems when we tried to add another dish, for which we followed up with the staff 4 separate times and it took over half an hour to come out. The operation seems pretty smooth, with lots of staff walking around with earpieces, though there never seemed to be a single person assigned to serve our table. I'd like to come back for dinner and try their other offerings, as I am sure they would also be very good.",

I loved the small dish of spicy cucumbers that was offered once seated. Our mains were enjoyed also. Would be fun with a bigger group to try more things, but three of us got a few items to share. Service overall was good; our waitress didn't have great English skills but ensured she checked when she wasn't sure of an answer. This will be on my return list next time I'm in the city.",

Craving dim sum, I found my way here, surrounded by bustling chinese waiters and waitresses, a packed dining room, a busy atmosphere and elegant black and gold decor. \u00a0The prawn dim sum, prawn cheung fun, and fried prawn dumplings with coriander were good. The scallop dim sum was just okay and the vegetarian one was not good.The black mushroom with braised noodles I ordered were pretty terrible and doused in a very unappetising sauce. The menu is very authentic but that meant for me that there were very limited choices of dim sum (I don't eat pork) because there wasn't any chicken or beef dim sum, only prawn or vegetarian. The service here is also very slow, as we asked for soy sauce for our dim sum, but none had arrived. We then tried to catch someone else's eye to ask for it, but that took ages as every waiter/waitress seemed intent on ignoring us. The food did arrive quickly though and piping hot. I had an okay time here, and even though our menu was more miss than hit, I might try coming back for the non-dim sum menu (other than those noodles) sometime.",
