    "text": "Le Pain Quotidien has become my go-to coffee place at work since my beloved Coffee Republic closed down. It should be noted, though, that this is purely out of need for a coffee place within 45 seconds of my desk and not because Le Pain is extraordinary in any way. Le Pain Quotidien is a \"quite nice\" little bistro-style restaurant and wine bar with a take-away coffee and pastry counter, selling such posh grocery items as free-range, corn-fed, sun-roasted coffee beans and \u00a36 PETA-endorsed granola (I kid, I kid. Though the teeny little bags of granola really are \u00a36.) The products are pretty decent, but nothing breath-taking. The coffee is palatable, despite the inexplicably foam-topped iced lattes (WTF?!) and the pastries are fine, but there is really nothing to keep me visiting this place daily other than its proximity to my office. The organic \"thang\" is great and I'm a huge fan, but as other businesses begin to get hip to the consumer appeal of fair-trade/organic products (Pret already sells only Rainforest Alliance fair-trade coffee, for instance), Le Pain will find themselves priced out of the market. \u00a0It sounds from other reviews that the sit-down side has a bit more awesomeness to offer than the take-away side, so maybe I'll try to pop round for a glass of wine after work and see if I'm seduced by the Pain, so to speak.I spend my days and nights wishing, dreaming, hoping, praying that an awesome and cheap coffee shop will move into the Coffee Republic space so as to give me a salmon bagel -serving alternative to Le Pain. Hell, if they would just bring Coffee Republic back, I'd be thrilled. Le Pain will suffice until that day arrives, though hopefully it won't be too long.",

It was supposed to be a chicken walnut salad, but it was pretty sparse. I thought it was crap for the price. On the other hand this place always has good bread and if you order the mezze type dishes, you will be plesantly surprised how good it is. A decent price as well. You will also feel quite glamorous sitting out here right in the paladium in front of this place. I did.",

For me It is carbo heaven, their bread is to die for, my favorite thing to do here is come for breakfast, order a big cup of cafe au lait, a basket of bread and get crazy with the amazing spreads they offer, my favorite is the praline spread, it is heavenly. Of course I can't treat myself to often this feast, otherwise I'd be a walking blob, but from time to time a little indulgence is perfectly allowed.",

(Like in Canada, they say skim rather than nonfat, except perhaps in Starbucks).I added a little sprinkle of sugar to the unsweetened yogurt - yummy but I could not finish it. The cappuccino was one of the best I have ever had. On to the bread. I could have eaten a shameful amount of the Belgian hazelnut praline spread - put Nutella to shame and I love Nutella.

Must be the great location in the middle of Covent Garden. My biggest problem with this location, however, is that it's quite dirty. Restrooms are often disgusting, tables could use a proper cleaning as well. Service: Hit or miss. We had a great server this time around, who was quick to take our order. Other times we haven't been as lucky and have struggled to find someone to take our order, to bring butter (can't have enough butter), to bring water, to bring us the check.Food: Is fairly consistently good. Love the Quinoa Cake and wish they served this in the USA. Bread is excellent and fresh. Salads are usually good as well.I'm sure we'll return as we're often in the area.

    "text": "I love everything organic and healthy and I like the Pain Quotidien interior with the long wooden tables, so I chose this place for a sweet afternoon snack. I got a chia seed pudding, which was pretty nice, and my brother ordered the Belgian waffle with warm chocolate. First of all, it was a tiny waffle and quite sad to look at. On top of that it also tasted awful and was only enjoyable with lots of chocolate poured over it.I hope that their savoury dishes are better!",

    "text": "Charmingly strange coffee place.I stopped by for a quick Mocha between getting some shopping down around Oxford St. I was having lunch a short while later, so didn't indulge in the delicious looking pastries and home-made sandwiches at the counter. I ordered and sat down to await my coffee.It arrived, and strangely in a bowl. Granted on a cold winter's day, this would be ideal. However drinking from a handleless mug/bowl was a little weird. But that added to the charm.Wifi as expected is free, and the place deceptively spacious. The ambience is quiet and groups would walk in for their meetings with laptops in hand.The theme is simplistic, you're able to buy all sorts of jams and teas you find on the shelves, but this place is nothing special, just another really good clean coffee shop. Food is absent from this review, but I'm sure it will be just as good as the coffee.",

    "text": "My first experience at Le Pain Quotidien was in Philadelphia in 2015; so I wanted to try out a London branch of this eatery. And I took the family there, since I had always told them mouth-watering stories about this Caf\u00e9. And...again it was a great experience. We liked the relaxed and donw-to-earth atmosphere. Food was excellent (particularly the bread with avocado spread) and my personal favourite: Belgian waffles with berries (although I must say: in the US they are a little more generous with the amount of berries they put on top...). Fast and friendly service, there was even a little time to chat with the waiter. Coming from Bavaria, we also like the concept of the Comunal Table.",

    "text": "- nicely located in Soho (not far from Liberty)- friendly staff- pretty popular place- nice and big variety of pastries/soups/salads/sandwiches (great bread)- detox salad was very flavorless (only a little bit of oil); ok it is detox, therefore no spices, pepper, salt; big portion including bread (9.80 GBP)- salmon & prawn platter (big variety of fish, guacamole, etc.) was good, but nothing special (13.95 GBP)- Vegetarian Tartine with goat cheese was really tasty (big portion as well; 10.75 GBP)- Scone with clotted cream and marmelade (4.10 GBP; big portion as well)- limonade (very sour, but tasty; 3.10 GBP)- big bowl of cappuccino (3.30 GBP)Conclusion: I liked the place and next time I would not take a salad but one of the tartines!",

Just order some prosciutto snack and watch as the thinnest sliver is lovingly served artfully folded on a slice of bread 30 times as thick.

Relieved of the duty of choosing, I was able to sit back and savour this very good French restaurant. The lunch menu is clipped to essentials and someone used to the likes of a Wetherspoons menu may not appreciate the offerings at a Le Pain Quotiiden.With an impressive variety of Tartines and Salads for mains, four different healthy sounding platters and starter options of soup, pate or quiche there is choice for those looking for an organic, anti-bloating meal.The clue is in the name, but if you like bread, Le Pain Quotidien will take you to heaven. This artisan bakery takes tremendous pride in their food and it shows. My beef tartine was very good, and I really enjoyed my pate and cornichons. For a big eating, hungry man (that's me), I would not recommend this restaurant. The meals are very well presented, clean and healthy, but it is unlikely you will leave feeling ultimately satisfied as there are no real lunchtime MEAL options. For the discerning health concious man/lady, this place is perfect.",
