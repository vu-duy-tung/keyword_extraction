I have to say the Pho lived up to its spicy name and I might have teared up a little. Both dishes were very well portioned for the price and quite delicious. If you are in the area we both highly recommend this spot.",

The prawn summer rolls had a strong coriander/basil flavor and were served with a delicate sauce, much different than the traditional peanut sauce. Very surprising and refreshing. I got the spicy pork pho soup, one of the best I've had. Super fresh ingredients, loved the texture of the noodles, broth was spicy and very layered. Absolutely divine.Service was spot on - our waiter was classy, extremely polite, and attentive. This is the kind of place you could eat at every day and not feel bad because it's affordable, tasty, fresh, and healthy. Yum!!",

    "text": "Ngon Ngon is quite a new Vietnamese restaurant situated in Clerkenwell, taking the former Cafe VN. Due to it's more commercial area it is more quiet during the weekend than the weekdays, especially during lunch hours. However it went through a lovely refurbishment with it's more welcomed yellow walls making the place seem more airy and bright, giving the place a nice wooden lodge cabin feel to it. The tables were nicely laid out, spacious with good natural light coming in too.Our waiter could have been a little more jollier. Most of the time he just stood there bored looking at their empty restaurant. The other staff seem to be more happier, one preparing the sprouts whilst the other remain on his phone nearly most of the timeVietnamese spring rolls As much as I enjoyed the crispiness and how greaseless these were, I found the skin too thick masking a lot of flavour and texture of the filing. From the photo I uploaded you can see how they were double wrapped. However I did enjoy the variation of meats in the filling, from shrimp, squid to pork which helped recover some flavour. Nuoc nam was perfectly sour to sweet, mild on the chilli which made a refreshing dipping sauce to balance out the heavinessGrilled quailThese were definitely worth ordering. Being quail they don't have a lot of meat on it but whatever was there was worth getting your fingers dirty for. The meat was incredibly flavoursome, rich, juicy and tender in the honey and Vietnamese spices it was marinated in. The dipping sauce it came with which tasted like salty sour plum was amazing, a bit strong so just a little dip will do the trick, sending a whole complex range of flavour across the quail.Vietnamese crepe with prawns Some have achieved a thinner crepe but this was still very satisfyingly thin, crispy and eggy. It was the filling that let it down a bit, lacking wok energy and a bit too wet with a monotone soy cornstarch slurry over the prawns and beansprouts. Needed more depth. But the variation of textures won it over for me. Lovely crunches and bounciness from the prawns. The nuoc nam aided it with flavour and a generous amount of Vietnamese herbs for complexity and to soak up the moisture.Salted and peppered while seabass Very presentable but poorly executed. The fried fish pieces delivered no flavour, bland and uninspiring. None of the onions, salt or pepper rubbed onto the fish which meant it lacked wok energy. The batter was chewy rather than crispy. The whole dish was desperately reliant on the nuoc nam for flavour.Grilled pork b\u00fan A very refreshing dish. The noodles were perfectly al dente topped over with aromatic pieces of grilled pork, packed full of flavour with a nice smokey edge to it from where it was charred. Peanuts and deep fried onions added a nice contrast in texture and added flavour. Herbs gave it complexity and made it peppery. Could have been a bit more generous with the nuoc nam seeing the size of the dish but a very minute problem seeing how delicious the dish was overall.Spicy beef noodles An excellent take on bun bo hue. The broth had depth and complexity with nice sour and spicy notes. The noodles were the authentic round kind, wonderfully slippery against the generous amount of tender rare beef slices which had a good amount of fatty bits giving it that richness in flavour and sweetness.Morning glory with garlicThis was nice to have as a side and cooked well where the garlic flavours really infused into the greens itself. Lacked wok energy although seasoning was perfect and a nice cornstarch slurry so the morning glory was kept moist and the flavours attached. Ngon Ngon is a quite a good choice if you're looking for decent Vietnamese food. It's definitely not perfect and lacks passion to deliver the best out of all the dishes especially with any dish requiring a wok as it seems they know how to let the oil heat up before putting the ingredients in to allow the flavours to be released. Their grilled dishes, noodle soups and buns are definitely more successful and if I was to return, I will stick to that.",

    "text": "There has been a lot of new Vietnamese restaurants opening around London recently : Viet Food in Soho and FOLD on Brick Lane which I have planned to visit pretty soon.Seeing all the vietnamese dishes on my Twitter timeline I decided to pay a visit to my old local restaurants around Holborn - Banh Mi Bay.On that occasion we were not very lucky with my boyfriend as Banh Mi Bay was already full. We went instead on Clerkenwell Road (3 minutes away) to Ngon Ngon.We arrived around 1.30pm. Ngon Ngon was absolutely packed too but we managed to get the last empty table. While we were ordering, we were informed that unfortunately they had totally sold out of banh mi. My boyfriend was a bit disappointed.We started our meal by sharing some prawn, pork and squid spring rolls. They were very light, crispy and full of flavour. I liked the fact they had squid in as it gave an extra texture to the usual classic prawn and pork spring rolls you get anywhere else.As a main dish, my boyfriend had the Pho tai, which was rice noodles in a clear beef broth with slim rare cuts of beef. It came with some chili, lime and herbs on the side.I tried his dish, the broth was packed in flavour (even without herbs and spice). The beef was also really tasty and not chewy at all.I had stir fried flat noodles with chicken (Pho Xao Ga). It came with some crispy vegetables: carrot, pak choi, courgette and crispy onions on top. I thought the dish was pretty good, and also had the perfect balance of meat, carbs and vegetables. I remember at Banh Mi Bay the portions are usually slightly bigger but you end up with more noodles than meat or vegetables.Service at Ngon Ngon was pretty good and quick, we waited only 5 minutes between ordering and getting dishes on the table. Our waiter was the restaurant Manager, who was pretty efficient, nice and friendly.Overall I think Ngon Ngon was close to be the perfect restaurant for a short lunch break for \u00a310 or less per head. All the dishes were delicious and smelled amazing. It would have probably been the perfect place if they hadn't sold out of banh mi by 1.30pm.",

Watching plates of sizzling dishes on super hot cast iron pans was nearly unbearable.We ordered a bunch of starters, the crispy squid was okay, but definitely not the best in London as the manager claimed. I ordered the Chef special of the day which was Hanoi fish with noodles. It was lovely, fresh and sizzling. Count me very happy.Sadly they didn't have their famous watermelon juice. Apparently they've stopped doing it because it was attracting a lot of flies to the restaurant, something I completely accept. It's a shame though.Price was pretty good and portions very decent.

I found the service slow and confused - we had to order with 3 different people. I found the food flavourless and overly greasy and we were placed downstairs in a windowless room (obviously I understand that they were busy but I would have waited for a table upstairs if we would have been asked).I opted for the chicken satay and chicken stir fry- the chicken satay actually wasn't too bad and I did like the sauce but found the chicken a bit too chewy. Then the stir fry with flat noodles - it came and shined, instantly knowing it was definitely more greasy than it should have been for Vietnamese. The veg within was cooked well but over all I just wasn't satisfiedMaybe it was because it was a busy day and I feel I would come back and give it another try but yeah, a disappointment for me on this occasion.",

The chicken satay was also yummy. For the main I tried the special salt and peppered beef which was also really good. We also tried the flat noodle chicken, again this was good. No room for dessert! The service is also good, everyone is kind and polite. All this and at a reasonable price. I can't wait to go back and have been wholeheartedly been recommending. Just go!",

    "text": "Food: 3 | Service: 2 | Ambiance: 3I've had my fair share of Pho and this one wasn't bad. I ordered the spicy beef pho and it was okay, I just didn't feel like the broth had the complexity or depth I'm used to. The real issue was that there was just a hint of grass in the aftertaste of the broth. Yes, grass. Like a lawn. That you mow. I asked the waiter after I had almost finished the bowl if they added any kind of vegetables or herbs to the broth and he said no. He then went on to suggest perhaps it's the chili oil. This made no sense to me so I said it's probably not the chili oil... Then he suggested it was lemongrass. I know what lemongrass tastes like, it's not lemongrass. I let it go and I asked to pay. A girl came back with the receipt and I gave her my card. She told me it was a \u00a310 minimum and my bill was \u00a39.50 and I had no cash. Let me say at this point that I saw no sign that said there was a minimum otherwise I would've gotten cash or wouldn't have sat down. So I asked to order a fresh juice (it was \u00a33+). She listed off the fruits and I chose watermelon. It came back to me and there was an odd taste to it. It was because there was TEA in it. The waitress failed to mention that it was a watermelon TEA. I mean it was still fine but it wasn't what I ordered. Btw, this is London and I speak English so this isn't a language issue. After all that I asked the staff if there was somewhere that said there is a \u00a310 minimum and she said no. Apparently the owners were making a sign. This should still be disclosed whether by announcing it upon arrival or scribbling it temporarily on a the back of a receipt and taping it to the window or counter. Anyways, I wasn't pleased with the service mostly. The grassy pho was fine but I wouldn't come back for it. Perhaps order something else?",

The only criticism I have is to change the sauce for the prawn summer rolls, but that is my opinion. I think the peanut hoisin sauce is much better and the thickness of the sauce goes well with the texture of the rolls. Or a fish sauce. The beef salad was perfect for the hot weather and fresh tasting. I felt the beef was borderline undercooked but for me I prefer it that way. The beef was very tender. I'll definitely be coming back.",

They were supposed to be open until 3pm, but at 2:30 they had a \"closed\" sign hung on the door.I then walked down a bit until I found this place and I'm so glad that I did. I had the pork bun (think vermicelli noodle salad) which was amazing. Just the right balance of flavours and textures. I felt guilty adding a bit of sriracha to up the heat, because the balance was absolutely perfect.I also had the spicy beef pho. Very tasty, however it has a strong smell and taste of beef in the soup, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you love your beef. There are plenty of other options on the menu too and when I saw them set up for evening service as I left, I realised that the dinner menu has more options than the lunch menu. The staff were excellent and took good care of me despite my arriving close to their closing time. They had unfortunately run out of the Vietnamese iced coffee, but they had my favourite aloe Vera drink and it was a lovely accompaniment to the light and healthy meal.I love tonkotsu ramen style broth, but on a sunny day like today, pho is absolutely perfect.",

From the outside, it looks like a warm and friendly place and this has proven to be true - service is fast and welcoming. There are quite a few Vietnamese places around this area but Ngon Ngon definitely stands out as one of the better ones in terms of selection of ingredients and flavours. The most important point of Vietnamese food is it's aroma - not that the food need to be more salty or more spicy, but the natural aroma that's lifted from the herbs and pho from this place definitely has that natural aroma and non-artificial taste. The well-done beef brisket was soft and tender, the beef and chicken slices were smooth and fresh. I also ordered the salt and pepper chicken wing as starter, I was glad to find the aroma and flavours are there, but it's not too salty at all!! Very nice with the dip too.WhileI was eating, I also saw one of the waiters carefully picking off the ends of each individual bean sprouts - with such careful dedication to their ingredients, no wonder their food is so nice.",

We were also seated upstairs. The decoration is rather basic. As for the meal, I quite enjoyed it. I had a chicken and noodle dish which was really good.

    "text": "My tip to judge the quality of an asian place is to go for the classics first. When testing a Thai, I generally go for the red chicken curry; and for the vietnamese, spring rolls are generally a good benchmark :) Sadly, the spring rolls here were pretty small and tasteless, and the rest wasn't much much better. The noodles in my spicy pho seemed very random, and the overall broth just lacked taste as well :( Chicken Satay can be so delicate, but here it was more \"sauce over big chunks of chicken\". Dishes came out super quickly (which is never a good sign) and the sweet waitress had to come twice to finally get our order right, made of 2 starters and 2 mains. I might give Ngon Ngon another chance..Not sure when though, there are so many great vietnamese options around...",

    "text": "I would give a 3-stars, but I'll give the 4-star review because my expectations are based on an area where pho is far more popular; I believe the pho in London is generally not very good, but these guys had an alright vegetable pho.The noodles were excellent as well as the tofu, but something just seemed a bit off with the broth and I was disappointed with what looked like a small serving size to me. \u00a0I couldn't tell if the broth was truly vegetarian or not. \u00a0Darker colour is usually an indicator that meat was used, but I didn't notice any of the oily spots associated with the meat broth. \u00a0I'm thinking it was probably a very strong mushroom broth, but I am still not sure and I didn't bother to ask (I'm not a vegetarian, but I prefer vegetarian dishes). \u00a0The other components of the pho, such as the mushrooms and Chinese broccoli, were also good. \u00a0I think the pho could have greatly benefited with some onions, carrots, and larger broccoli pieces such as the ones you'll see at Sainsbury's for ~ 50 p and some bok choy. \u00a0The price of this dish was shy of \u00a38.The presentation of the pho was beautiful. \u00a0It came in a tall looking bowl, and the platter was very unique! \u00a0The ambiance of the area was very calming and there was plenty of comfortable seats to choose from. \u00a0I must admit the lighting was a bit dim, but I'm not sure if a super bright place would be fitting for their room and the yellow walls and artwork compensated for it anyways. \u00a0I liked that there were seating facing the window, but I chose a table instead because I had my backpack and felt it would be easier to sit it along the table instead. \u00a0If I lived in that area, then I would probably choose to grab a bowl each day, hang out, and work on assignments from my modules at the university.Customer service was excellent. \u00a0I was promptly seated, they understood my order well, and they allowed me to keep the menu to look at other dishes if I may have wanted to order more. \u00a0I was tempted because the selection was very good... egg fried rice appeared to be a reasonably good price and I was curious about the vegetarian and tofu rolls (seems the difference between the two was primarily the taro root in the vegetarian one). \u00a0Nothing appeared wrong with it, but I simply didn't feel like having a starter/side today. \u00a0I was able to pay for my meal quickly after I finished, and the staff were very friendly and could maintain a conversation.Overall: I would recommend this place to friends who are visiting London and want pho. \u00a0The ambiance was nice and I'd love hanging out there, and the staff did an excellent job.",

We stopped by for some crispy salt and pepper squid which was really well prepared, perfectly balanced flavours and textures and a generous portion. Top rating. I enjoyed a bowl of monkfish pho. Again great flavoured soup, generously loaded with fish slices (lightly battered) and aromatics.Food came quickly, was delicious, and good value.The staff were welcoming and friendly and great service so looking forward to coming back.",
