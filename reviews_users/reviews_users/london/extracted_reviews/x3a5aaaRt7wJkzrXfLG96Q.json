They are really fast here! The service was very good and the food amazing! We went with the veggie samosas, the ruby chicken and one of the rice dishes and garlic naan !! We loved every bit!! The decor and music was so lovely. I wish our time in London wasn't close to ending because I would love to go back to Dishoom for another great meal!!",

The waiter was great, knew the menu well, and checked back with us several times. By the time we left (8 pm) it was very busy. My overall impression was very good, although a bit pricey, I would eat there again. Nice decor.",

The staff was not only pleasant but incredibly accommodating of our 2 year old. Nothing but smiles and \"no problems\"! The atmosphere can't be beat, either. A jazz trio happened to be playing during this visit and it just added to the 'Darjeeling Limited' vibe. The manager was more than lovely and urged us to come back for breakfast....little does she know that we will be back for all three meals very soon!",

My boyfriend and I were craving Indian before our flight back to the states, and we met somebody in Florence that recommended Dishoom. Right when we arrived we were told there was a short wait and were directed to the bar. Such a cool set up and atmosphere, we enjoyed our drinks and had no problem waiting the 10 or so minutes it took to seat us. The waiter was very helpful and explained the whole menu to us, as it was our first visit. We got the lamb samosas and calamari to start. Both were flavored perfectly and cooked extremely well. The calamari was crispy and not too chewy. The sauces were all great, it was nice to have a variety of flavors and level of spiciness. After, we got the chicken ruby which was an amazing curry that I'm literally still dreaming about. The flavors were off the charts, so rich and went perfectly with the garlic naan. We also got a potato dish-- I don't remember what it was called-- which was awesome. The potatoes weren't too crispy and weren't too soft, spiced perfectly-- a little lemon flavor but not too much. Absolutely outstanding meal, seriously one of the best meals of my life. I would come back to London just to eat at this place. On our way out each member of the staff said goodbye and were so kind! I'd give it six stars if I could.",

    "text": "I think the starting premise with Dishoom is that there is a lot of hype. I lived in London for over 4 years without ever dining at one of their locations, not for lack of trying. Very few things are worth a two hour wait when you are hungry. However, now that they have expanded their presence to new corners of London, this has finally shifted the supply/demand imbalance and I was able to make a booking for this new location with a group of 8 on a weekday evening.Being Dishoom newbies, we largely ordered what the server recommended, which ended up being the lamb samosas, murgh malai, masala prawns, jackfruit biryani, mattar paneer, chicken ruby, the chef's special (a lamb stir fry), bowl of greens, the roti, and a lot of garlic and cheese naan. As a regular patron of South Asian restaurants in London but not a connoisseur, nothing was particularly unique to the point of writing home about, but they were all tasty.However, what does stand out is the spectacular venue, which is right off Kensington High Street with an impressive entrance and high ceilings in an Art Deco building. They seem to have a balcony where a band could play, but there was no live music while we were there. Dishoom bridges the gap in the London restaurant scene between BYOs in Whitechapel and the Michelin star Indian establishments in Mayfair. It's worth a visit, but not a wait. I would note that at this location there wasn't a queue out the door, so I don't think it would be that difficult to walk in on a weekday evening.",

SO worth the wait (which wasn't that long actually, only 45 minutes for 2 people on a Saturday night, and they give you a buzzer so that you can post up at the bar).

    "text": "And I thought I would not be surprised by better Indian food in London, How wrong was I!! Nested in a side street to Kensington High in London is the chic art-deco establishment of Dishoom. Much less crowded than its central London counter part, without a reservation I was in an seated within just a few minutes. With ample seating space and lively atmosphere the place accommodates the large group as well as the diner-a-la-solo. The concept is \"street-food Bombay\" with good variety of choices that is sure to please the carnivore and the veggie eater. Portions are small, order some 3 plates per person. The Black dal dish IS MADE IN HEAVEN, an entourage of perfectly balanced spices invade your palate with a punch of buttery flavor, smooth and creamy, fragrant and just delicious. I had the lamb boti kabab, super tender lamb well marinated in a citrus base that gave it the gentle kick of acid to go with the rich sauce of red chilly, garlic and ginger. Together with a freshly made fluffy garlic Nan bread and an ice cold Kingfisher, this was a feast of flavor difficult to top. Moderately priced (its London Ok) with excellent service and outstanding cuisine, Dishoom deserves more stars that Yelp gives. I will absolutely come back to be further surprised by the creative deliciousness and \u00a0simplicity of its dishes.",

The food is great, the ambience is lovely, the decor is kinda different and it has a spacious seating area. I must say that the portion sizes are really small and its expensive for that. 2 people dinner with no alcohol, 80 pounds. You do the math! It's definitely worth going once to this place but it's a bit over rated.",

We had a little bit of everything and were super impressed. It's definitely not your home cooked Indian food, it's very elevated but I definitely loved everything I ate. We basically had to roll ourselves out of there we ate so much. The service was great even though it was crazy busy. I wish I lived in London so that I could come here all the time. Oh and btw the chicken ruby was one of the best dishes I've ever had!!!!",

I don't think that you could go wrong with any item on the Dishoom menu. Everything is extremely fresh and cooked to perfection. You'd be a fool to not try Indian food at Dishoom.

The vegetable samosas were well filled and very light. \u00a0We also ordered the mattar paneer with garlic naan which was very flavorful! Drinks, I got the bollybellini which was nice and fruity. The rose & cardamom and mango & fennel lassis were both delicious but don't expect the cardamom and fennel to be incorporated into the lassi it is more as a garnish to the drink. The service was very accommodating and pleasant. I wish we had more time in London to enjoy another meal!",

Out of paratha, roti and naan, the paratha was my favorite. It was difficult picking dessert because all of the options sound delicious. The kala Khatta ice was interesting because it was salty.

There are small plates, appetizers, mains and more, many vegetarian. This is not your typical Indian restaurant and the most fun we had while dining in London. While we dined, a live jazz band played in a loft. The rooms are very lively, and you have the feeling of being back in the era it represents (1940s). I started with Pau Bhaji, which is mashed vegetables served with two buttered hard rolls...delicious. The Black Daal was tasty and substantial. I had a side of Dishoom slaw, a perfect accompaniment. Cocktails and mock tails flow and are wonderful. The food was great, the service was great and the atmosphere fun. What more can you ask for? I hear there are plans to open a Dishoom in NYC. I will definitely make it a priority for dining.",

It's a great laid back date night spot, and a great Indian restaurant. If I lived in London I would probably spend all my money ordering this for take away. The service is great, the prices are fair, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. \u00a0We ordered the following: Chicken Ruby- deliciousMasala Prawns- so deliciousSpicy Lamb Chops- unbelievably delicious Mutton Pepper Fry- delicious Garlic Naan- delicious \u00a0Next time we're in town, we'll be back!",

Like my husband and I kept talking about it afterwards good.Everything we ordered was delicious. \u00a0My son even gobbled up all his grilled fish. \u00a0The chai was fantastic. \u00a0They offer refills. \u00a0I did not know this, and was trying to make my tiny cup last the whole meal. \u00a0They even refilled my son's juice. \u00a0The cups here are tiny by American standards (maybe 6 oz), so the refills make a difference. \u00a0The chicken biryani was very flavorful. \u00a0The buttered veggies with hot rolls (I forgot the name) was a good starter, but I would skip it next time. \u00a0The absolute must eat is the black dahl!",

    "text": "Food is a 3.5, but the restaurant itself is a 4. Very cool art-deco interior. I may be totally missing the link to Indian cuisine, or maybe it's an old art-deco building they preserved but in any case, nice decor. I had the ruby chicken and the lamb chops. The waiter described the ruby chicken as the most delicious thing on the menu. It was okay. Kind of sweet. Tastes like there might be a smidge too much tomato paste. The lamb chops were pretty tasty though they definitely need the citrus from the lime that's served with it. It would have been nice to have the option to have them rare. The waiter didn't ask. They were served well-done. The garlic naan was pretty lousy. Definitely not made to order like they say. Mine was cold and didn't have much garlic. Would come back for the ambiance. It is nothing special in terms of the food.",

    "text": "I was recommended by a friend to check out Dishoom, so I made it one of my top priorities to try Dishoom in London! There's many locations spread out but I decided to stop by this one since we were nearby.The restaurant is definitely nicer. It has a nice, casual vibe to it. We ordered the chicken ruby, mutton pepper fried, garlic naan, rice. The chicken ruby dish was delicious, we really enjoyed it! The curry here is rich, delicious and flavorful.My biggest complaint is that the portions and pricing. I wish it was better buck for your deal, quality is up to par though. Service is good. We did order a dish but they totally forgot it, we didn't mention it until the end though. Overall, a great place to indulge in your Indian cravings in the UK!",

Once we were seated, we ordered different dishes to share. Our waitress recommended about 2-3 dishes/person but we ordered 2 and we had plenty! Highly recommend the veggie samosas, dahl, and veggie curry. It was all delicious and wish we had one closer to our home!",

    "text": "TL;DR: The less busy, touristy version of the Carnaby location that you can walk into with equally good food. Best samosas I've had in US and the UK.Located on a side street off high street Kensington (across from the Equinox, which will taunt you with photos of impossibly chiseled people after you stumble out with a food baby), I was able to walk into this location without a wait on a Sunday afternoon. There are plenty of seats available as it's a multi-level restaurant, and waitstaff was attentive and helpful, suggesting multiple options for me as a first time diner. I got the veggie samosas to start, which was by far the best decision I made. They are about the size of my palm and unlike samosas I've had in the US, these are lightly filled and beautifully crispy. I highly recommend to any diner, vegetarian or not. I also had the paneer curry with basmati rice, and it was perfect; filling, but not overly greasy or heavy, with a nice blend of spices that didn't upset my stomach in the way that some Indian food tends to do.Total cost around 20 pounds, or $26. Not a cheapo Indian option but the quality of food is by far worth it.",

Here at Kensington we were informed it would be 45 minutes and were invited to sit at the bar. We had the old fashioned (it was delicious!!!!)They give you a pager so any drinks you order come up on your final bill once you're done drinking & eating. We waited about the estimated time and were seated in view of the awesome band playing upstairs. Since it was my first time having Indian food, our wonderful server explain dishes to me and recommended some. We ordered so many different items, and they were delicious. Go here!",
