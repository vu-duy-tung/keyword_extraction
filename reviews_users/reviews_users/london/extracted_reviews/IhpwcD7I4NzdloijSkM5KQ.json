However, I agree with Derry N's review regarding the service. Though the staff are friendly enough, from the times I have dropped by, service has just been rather slow, from waiting to have the orders taken to waiting for the food to be served. However, I highly recommend the breakfast menu, especially the all American, and their choice of smoothies and fruit juices pack in a healthy punch of delight. However, aside from the breakfast menu, I wouldn't really go for anything else. Last time I went I had a pie of some sort, which tasted fine, but having had only been there for their breakfasts every other time, in comparison them, it was a disappointment. This might have a little to do with the fact that this little establishment has the word 'Breakfast' in its title, making one feel not quite at ease to be eating lunch/ dinner food when the restaurants' name suggests otherwise!",

Shame, as the cute location and variety of breakfasts used to make it top of my list.We went for a late breakie today, ordering a full english and the spanish version with chorizo sausages: neither were anything special. The chorizo was extremely greasy, with plasticky skin that I actually abandoned as I got bored of chewing, whilst the sausage on the english breakfast was completely tasteless. The hash brown was super disappointing... just a pile of over cooked potato cube/mush sort of thing. Named \"The Full Monty\" and priced at a hefty \u00a38.50 the full english looked more like a half portion. I deffo wont be going back and the only reason they get two stars instead of one is because the staff are really nice and chirpy and the blackcurrent smoothy was a treat (well at \u00a33.50 it should be). Maybe it's getting away with sliding a little, well a lot, because of it's hip reputation, but really what has happened to you BC?! if you want to spend this much on a breakfast I'd seriously recommend going to Roast instead.",

Yesterday I found myself dragged inside by their cunning use of Bon Jovi lyrics, 'Standing on your mamma's porch you told me this would last forever...', an unusual technique for pulling in customers I think you'll agree. This sense of humour runs right through the restaurant and the staff, while not the fastest in the world, are always very friendly and up for a chat. The great breakfast is the reason that most people come which is better and more reasonably priced than any of the neighbouring pubs. My only criticism would be a lack of continuity from the kitchen. Portion sizes never seem the same from one trip to the next, nor to the person sitting two tables away. \u00a0Regardless of this I know I'll be back as I can't help the pull that Bon Jovi has over me.",

Besides the breakfast, there are a lot of sandwiches and salads on offer.

I went on two consecutive days; once on my own then again with friends for brunch but, due to tube nonsense, brunch turned more into lunch as I didn't actually get there until 12ish on both occasions. The location is great, the cute and cosy little caf\u00e9 fits right in in this cute and cosy little alley. As it is so cute and cosy seating is a bit of a sticky issue, I think there's less than 10 tables all together and the first time I went I had to wait 10 minutes to get a table, second time 15 minutes and there's nowhere really to stand except for; in the way, by the door.Once you're seated the menu is really good. I had the Fully Monty breakfast and the American breakfast which were both dead tasty. Sausages and bacon were a little tough but excusable, the eggs were amazing, I've never, ever been able to scramble an egg to make anything but rubbery mess so I'm always impressed when that goes right. First time I ever put syrup on breakfast but, my god, you Americans have it right. Sugar + fat is always a winning combination.Good coffee, very good infact although I prefer the mint tea which is actual mint leaves in boiling water. It just never crossed my mind that it was possible to make mint tea from .. mint but now I know I fully intend to exploit this to show off my \"indie\" tea credentials. Who needs teabags? Service seems .. inconsistent shall we say. First visit got a lovely waitress who was attentive and I got my food and tea straight off the bat and had a chat with her afterwards. Second time around the service was friendly but slow; we were going to have dessert but by the time the waitress remembered to bring us the menus we decided to go. Price was ok I guess. \u00a38 for a big breakfast, under a tenner for most stuff and you can get various breakfast items for under a fiver. Tea for \u00a32 was pushing it a bit but they had nice mugs so .. what the hell. The worst thing about the experience was having to sit next to the world's wankiest graphic designers talking very loudly about implementation, facilitation, engineering experiences and creating a user-guided feedback system but you can't really blame this place for it's hipster client\u00e8le. Well, maybe you can a bit since it does appeal to the hipster but I'll let that slide. 3 stars because I would go again and probably again and again but that's more because I'm a creature of habit than because of the place itself.",

The food was great, I've had burgers, breakfast, sandwiches, smoothies, daiquiris, coffee, etc etc etc and have yet to be disappointed. \u00a0Prices are fairly reasonable as well. They're open late (for the area) so take advantage of it if you've come out of the cinema or don't want pub grub as it's usually pretty quiet in the evenings. \u00a0Do be warned: weekend breakfast/brunch rush can make for a queue 20-40 min long (worth it though, I think). \u00a0If you're wanting to give it a try but can't wait that long, I've been told there's a new one by Hoxton square and they're meant to be bigger, so I'm assuming the wait would be considerably less (speculation). \u00a0But if you live in Islington or are a frequent visitor of Angel/upper st, don't pass this place up!!",

I'm giving this place 4 stars because the service is great - with these kind of hipster venues, there's a danger that the waiting staff don't give a rat's ass about you and look like they've just come off a 4-day ket bender and have barely squeezed into their skinnies in time to come in for work. The Breakfast Club staff all look happy to be there - I've seen waitresses singing to themselves, and when one waitress messed up my order, she threw in a free pot of tea to make up for it.

See further reviews on their page.).What makes them spectaconderful? Really good smoothies, amazing wraps, and good breakfasts. The decor is an eclectic mix of 80s memorabilia and just RANDOM stuff. My absolute favorite thing about it, above all, is the music they play. It's a throwback to the 80s and early 90s goodness that makes me super super happy to have been born in time for it. Seriously, you will end up singing along to such favorites as MJ, Madonna, Bananarama and Heart.

Strong & tasty in a large cup.Food; came out very quickly, everything was as ordered and tasted good. Vegetarian \"sausage\" was more like a non-falafel spiced falafel, but good in a non sausage kind of way. Regardless, as someone who doesn't eat pork I appreciated the option. Pancakes were pretty decent, the topping was really good. \u00a0All in all very satisfying. \u00a0Portions were very large, none of us finished our plates... and I'm generally a \"clean plate\" kind of guy.Prices; very reasonable for London.

Not even a little bit.For starters, my server didn't write down our order, then got it wrong, then charged us for the pleasure. Lovely.Our table had been wiped down right before we were seated, and there was a layer of grey water all over the surface. I sopped it up with a paper napkin and it came away soggy and grimy. Charming.On to the food...The pancakes were a crime against flour and eggs. They were...crunchy? Hard? Whatever they were, I literally could not cut them with the side of my fork. The bacon was cold, the potatoes we're NOT hash browns at all, and they were soggy! If you want to market yourself as an American diner, learn the basics and learn to do them right. Pancakes have got to be the easiest breakfast item to cook and they are so fast to make! There is no excuse for making them in advance and reheating them.I will not be going back, needless to say.",

I went last weekend and managed to queue for just 15 mins before being escorted past the long queue of groups and families... in fact by the time I finished my breakfast the family queuing in front of me initially had only just sat down.I can't seem to order anything but pancakes with maple syrup and bacon .... oh gosh they are incredible, so naughty and what a flavour combo with the salty bacon and sweet syrup.... the PERFECT hangover cure! All finished off with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ and a latte. I had only had 4 hours sleep the night before and this breakfast certainly sorted me out for the day! Highly recommended.",

The menu looks enticing, but the quality of the ingredients and presentation is terrible. Customer service is also extremely slow and not very inviting.

There was a line waiting outside the door, so you know at that point it has to be good. So we waited probably like 30 min. And I gotta say, well worth the wait. Once we were in, we were placed in pretty close proximity to the other diners, but the place was so small this was necessary. It would've been a much longer wait if this was not the case. Anyway, I got the breakfast burrito, which was the best decision of my life. So filling. So delicious. Fantastic hang over breakfast. If I ever come back to London, I'm going again for sure.",

The Breakfast Club offers a perfect mix of delicious breakfasts, \u00a0sandwiches, and cupcakes. \u00a0For me the eggs Florentine is simply perfection. \u00a0The english muffin perfectly toasted, poached eggs a bit runny, and the hollandaise sauce yummy and buttery. \u00a0Beware: the lines are long and the service is a bit slow, but I definitely think it's worth the wait. I can't wait for another eggs Florentine. Gnomes at the front of the restaurant and quotes from the movie The Breakfast Cub posted on the walls give this restaurant a cozy and quaint feel.",

    "text": "As an American from San Francisco, the Land o' Brunch, this is, unfortunately, one of the few places in London that come close to doing brunch properly. I say 'unfortunately' due to two things:1. I live five minutes from the Camden Passage location, and on the weekends, the wait is easily over half an hour. And on a cold, rainy Sunday, you feel every minute of that in the wet cobblestones beneath your feet. However, I always feel like complaining about wait time is silly--a place shouldn't be penalized for popularity, right? They can only do so much in a limited space short of rushing patrons in and out (which they thankfully don't do, something you appreciate once you finally get in). (So maybe I should strike this point? Hmmm.) Also, they delivered pretty little shots of hot cocoa with a perfect little marshmallow to the waiting line, and that was sweet beyond sweet. So, okay, I officially take back this con.But Reason #2 must stay:The Eggs Benedict (in any of its myriad versions). Maybe I'm alone here, but one of my favorite parts of eggs benedict is the moment when you pierce the poached egg and the yolk rushes down, coating your hollandaise-laden ham/spinach/salmon and english muffin with a beautiful yellow fountain of sweet delicious heaven. I LIVE for this moment at brunch-time. I cannot get ENOUGH of this moment. I will sometime pierce each egg as slowly as possibly just to see how long I can delay the volcanic rush. But the Breakfast Club steals this life pleasure from me, every time--their poached eggs are overcooked and the yolks are always hard. And nothing brings me closer to flinging a plate against a wall more than a hard-cooked poached egg. I find this a tragedy of epic proportions. And I've never been bold enough to send it back, because I always worry the chef will 'gift' my next plate, and hollandaise could hide a LOT. Also, there was some wimpy little salad leaves tossed onto my plate to make it look full, but they were dry as a desert and definitely looked like they were on their last legs. It was like where salads go to die. Also, there was a cold, cooked piece of egg white that I found at the bottom of it that sort of freaked me out. Didn't stop me from eating it (there are few things I won't put in my mouth), but still, WHOA. I did pause, which says a lot.That said, there are pro's (obviously, since I keep returning): my friend got the Ham So Eggsited yesterday, and the layers of ham, cheese, and fried egg between the maple-syrup coated pancakes was literally TO DIE FOR. * so * * good * I may have to give up my failed benedict and start getting this instead. Also, the menu is a proper-brunch menu--from breakfast burritos to designer pancakes and french toast. This is something I value and treasure. I'm just waiting for the day they do bacon waffles--and I do mean streaky bacon, and I do mean cooked into the waffle. Oh, and their bloody mary's taste like burning. I love it, but some of our party couldn't drink theirs--apparently they didn't like their noses running and throats on fire? (Wimps. Should've ordered them less spicy.) A mimosa on the menu would've been great, though, and a Ramos Fizz wouldn't go amiss.",

But for a place that lives and dies by its reputation for serving breakfast, they have a terrible attitude to serving it on time.Pretty much every place that serves breakfast in London, from the greasy spoon on the corner to The Wolseley opens at 7am on a weekday, in order to serve people breakfast at a time when people want eat it. TBC Camden Passage, on the other hand, thinks 8am is more appropriate.While that's probably a terrible business decision, it might not be that bad if they did in fact open on time. Instead, I arrived at 7.45am, was told to wait until it opened at 8am, and then came back at 8am to be told that the manager had gone off somewhere and would be back to open up some time in the next half hour. The lackadaisical air of the chef who told me this suggested that this was not an isolated incident. They could not have been less interested in my business.Get. It. Together.",

I love their virgin cocktails and fresh mint teas, fresh juices etc.Service is super nice, attentive, friendly and fast.",

    "text": "My husband I went for a late breakfast/lunch on Tuesday. I have aways seen a long line on Saturday during the antique market and been wanting to try it out! We had All American Pancakes and Apple Cinnamon French toast. I liked the good service and the terrace seats, but I could not figure out the reason why people are lining up for!!! The pancakes were ok, but rather tasteless, and the porched eggs were bit hard.... Plus, the French toast is made of just regular bread, not from brioche. To me, charging 7 pounds for something so ordinary and tasteless was little bit unjustifiable.... As some reviews have mentioned, maybe they have better days when they make better pancakes, but I was quite disappointed because my expectation was really high after seeing the long line! My recommendation; walk around in the area since there are so many cute places on Upper street or on Essex road (well, Essex road does have few cute places for brunch, though fewer in number compared to Upper street.)",

Because it was a late Sunday morning the line was somewhat long, but even with an estimated wait time of 30 minutes we were seated around the 20 minute mark. I ordered chicken & waffles which was quite delicious, the chicken was soft and fried to crispy perfection, and the waffles were not too thick, which I also loved. The gravy, chili butter, and syrup were a great mix for the waffles. The Black tea was good as well. My boyfriend ordered the full Monty and lemon ginger tea, all of which looked great. I sampled the potatoes and they were delicious -- not too hard, and well seasoned. Lastly, I don't really like pancakes but my boyfriend ordered them, so I decided to at least try them... Them I ended up eating them all, whoops. The pancakes were so amazing that I'm sure that will be the next thing I order next time I make it to The Breakfast Club. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good brunch spot!",

I don't love this place that's for sure. The service is low, the staff lazy and they insist on putting chives on top of everything savoury. What is it with the chives BC? They are like mini onion flavours, taking over my plate and ruining my yummy breakfast. But, once you have scraped off the offending herb, you'll enjoy some fabulous feasting. It's the UK version of American brunch, served up in kitch surroundings with a small side of maple syrup. So my tips to you are; prepare to wait, after 9am there is always a queue and secondly, tell them no chives!",

It's yellow on the outside, c'mon- you know it'll be fun :) There's a wide range of music that plays too- some that didn't fit with the decor, but whatever. It's also quite small and it gets busy in the mornings!Food: My friend got the French Toast with Bacon and bananas and it looked CRAZY. (pictures up) Just typing this review reminds me of how interesting this combo is, haha. BUT, She ate it all up and said it was delicious!I got the eggs Florentine because i LOVE eggs florentine/benedict/salmon. The biggest criteria i have for these dishes though is that the egg MUST be poached well and the hollandaise sauce must be pretty decent. The BC got the sauce okay, but the egg was a bit overcooked. (I know, I'm picky...) I finished it all, but it was not the best I've had.I do love that you get your coffee in nice big home-y mugs though :)Bottom Line: It's a cute quirky place to go to breakfast with a few friends (especially good after a night out on the town!!) and to get an American breakfast fix!",

It could've been beautiful, but they went over the edge with this thing. \"Chorizo, scrambled egg, roasted peppers, Portobello mushroom, guacamole, cheddar and spicy pepper sauce.\"There was no mushroom in my burrito. And while the roasted peppers were nice and the chorizo good (though a bit greasy, as chorizo is wont to do), the eggs and \"spicy pepper sauce\" were *rough*. When I first cut into the burrito, it released a cartoon-like waft of hot sauce. It was like I'd been maced.COOL IT WITH THE TABASCO! It wasn't a spiciness problem -- that was fine. It was just so much all you tasted was vinegar and that tell-tale Tabasco flavor and you lost the flavor of the peppers and the eggs and chorizo. It really didn't need it at all. Without it, it would've been a better burrito. Just because it's an American-style eatery and its a breakfast burrito doesn't mean you have to choke it with Tabasco. I'd leave that to the diner to add.I'd also recommend chopping the peppers and chorizo a bit more for more flavor distribution, but hey, that's just me.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the Breakfast Club (both the movie and the chain of American restaurants). This branch of the chain is the closest to my house and it has become my place to bring visiting friends and family to try a full English breakfast (or full monty, as they call it here). It is also a fun place for brunch with friends, as the shop is filled with kitchy decoration and plays lovely music. The Islington branch is located in Camden Passage and can be easily identified by the giant queue that seems to be a permanent fixture out-front. Luckily, if you come here in a group, you can take turns standing in line and perusing the antique markets that are all up and down Camden Passage on the weekend. The Breakfast Club is a small space that is packed with tables. Their turnaround is pretty quick and I have never had to wait for tooo long. I love the food in this (and every) location of The Breakfast Club. They have a big selection of tasty breakfast food, available to satisfy pretty much everyone. From the healthy avocado and poached egg to the indulgent \"ham so excited\" (a stack of pancakes sandwiched with slices of ham and with melted cheddar cheese); It has uniformly impressed me with flavour. My favorite dishes have been the full monty, the fried chicken sandwich and the boston baked beans (bbq braised pork with white beans and a poached egg). Also delicious are the selection of drinks and cocktails. They have super tasty smoothies, amazing bloody marys and a unique selection of breakfast-ey-cocktails (i've had and enjoyed the morning mojito and the earl grey sour). I would give this place full marks for food but I have a few hesitations. 1) I think this place is sometimes wildly overpriced for what it is. There are a few things on the menu I see as reasonable, but many of the meals (particularly egg and avocado) as well as the non-alcoholic drinks are crazy expensive (as is the case at any Breakfast Club location. 2_ I have had a few iffy customer service experiences at the Islington location, specifically. I was unsure of how to queue (if you needed to put your name and number of diners in, before waiting). When going inside to ask, my sister and I have both been treated rudely by staff members who assume that we should just know what to do. This coldness has extended on a few occasions to service during the meal, when it can take ages for orders to get taken or you are not given enough time to figure out what you want. None of this stops me from heading there on a hungover sunday for bloody marys and tasty breakfast food...but my pocketbook can only take it every so often.",

    "text": "Having finally made it to the infamous Breakfast Club this morning for an early brunch, I can say I was overall a little disappointed.Firstly, the queue wasn't quite so bad as I had envisioned. My partner and I waited around 15 minutes to get a table and we were served quickly. I ordered the pancakes with berries and vanilla cream, my partner opted for the veggie pancake breakfast. We both got an americano. We considered getting a juice or smoothie, but at \u00a34.50 (average price) a glass it seemed a little overpriced. While (briefly) waiting for the food we had a look at the interior; this is a crowded little joint with some hipster memorabilia adorning the walls, loud (bad) music and many tourists clutching guidebooks or backpacks. The music was the most distracting thing, but the waitress turned it down a shade when I asked.When the food came, we were presented with A LOT of food. This is a good thing for some, but given that I left over half of the food in my plate I can say I would rather pay half and get a smaller portion. I have four big fluffy pancakes stacked up, covered in a sweet vanilla cream, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries and a generous drizzle of maple syrup. My partner's plate had pancakes, maple syrup, a veggie sausage, saut\u00e9d potatoes and grilled mushrooms. It looked pretty good but I wouldn't have been able to eat it so early. He rated the veggie sausages but also found the portion size too big.After eating we we quite quickly presented with the bill without having asked for it, probably to accommodate more people waiting in the line. Overall our bill came to around \u00a323 and we didn't even get a juice on the side. In all honesty I cannot see why the Breakfast Club is so popular. Maybe it was great back when it was a \"secret\", but the loud music, crowds and prices are not great considering the other options in London. I'd far rather be somewhere where there's no rush to leave, where I can chill with a book or my laptop.",

I think they must leave the avo in fridge.On the plus side... the service was A-OK and the menu is people-pleasing extensive. I'd pop back if I was in the in the area and ravenous but with so many incredible cafes in London and so little time, definitely not this trip.",

It comes with \u00a0a coleslaw I didn't eat. My husband had the Hams So Eggcited and said it was quite good; the silver dollar pancakes were not as quite as he makes at home but still decent. Our friends had the All American and smoked salmon and it drew rave requests. Good service as well. The only reason for not having a final star was because the food was very good but not amazing.",

I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was a great combination of a pork sandwich, potatoes and coleslaw. Having said that, I feel like the pork could have been better seasoned. Service was rather disappointing. It was slow, and the staff couldn't have been less enthusiastic to serve. The ambience was hipster and artsy. Downside is that it's small, meaning there could be long queues during peak times, so be sure to budget enough time. Overall, a good brunch place, but with room for improvement.",

I've been to the Breakfast Club in London Bridge and really enjoyed my meal. This one was rather bland. I had a chicken burger - perhaps my problem was not having a breakfast option?! It also came with tomato on it, which I hate and I resent it when restaurants don't detail things like this on their menu. In addition, the room itself is small and less interesting than the other BCs I have been in or passed through. However, we really enjoyed the bingo that made up the evening's entertainment. I think it happens once a month? It costs \u00a35 and involves three games and a lot of shots. I'd go back again, but only on a night with entertainment going on.",

    "text": "Their shit is clearly the good kind, because the place is packed! You either get there early enough to say \"Top o' the mornin' to ya' laddies!\" or late late lunch, when people with jobs and such are not having lunch. The place is like a beehive, buzzing with loud talk, fast food, good music, and generally a very hungry energy. We were not hungry, we went there to stuff our faces with pancakes. And everybody knows you don't need to be hungry to eat pancakes. When I saw their menu I suddenly got a Sophie's choice kinda feeling. I looked around and everybody had delicious looking stuff on their plate! Huevos rancheros, Pulled pork sandwich served with fries, Eggs Benedict, Eggs Florentine and oh Lord, The Pancakes!. So we got the Eggs Benedict and The Pancakes & berries. My boyfriend had the coffee and I had The Slow Boy juice (Apple, Carrot, Orange, Ginger). And boy, was it slow! They kinda forgot about us for a while, it was clearly a mistake that doesn't happen very often and they handled it perfectly. They took responsibility for the mistake, apologized, served us promptly and said that the bill is on them, because we had to wait for so long. 10/10!The food was amazing! The eggs were just how The God of Eggs intended! Poached to perfection, placed on a toasted English muffin dressed in ham clothes, topped with creamy hollandaise sauce and sent off into the world! And right when I'm about to say that there just is no better way to a breakfast-loving-heart, the pancakes and berries appear like a gift sent from heaven! 'Cause why else I am hearing angels sing?! As fluffy as a bear cub's bottom, as chewy as Chewbacca and as sweet as a squirrel in the snow (a bunny would have been too sweet, a squirrel is perfect), these pancakes are the past, the present and the future! And if that wasn't enough sitting on top of this glorious stack of happiness, is a luscious vanilla cream that sits there like lipstick on a pretty girl's lips. Effortlessly. Like it belongs. Like it's been there since the beginning of time. You think I'm done? I am not done. On and around this mountain of joy, topped with a fat cloud of fat, berries of all kinds are sprinkled around. Like precious beads of freshness that bring out the very best in you. All of this sitting in a puddle of maple syrup, also known as the Elixir of life and love and all that is good in the world. So next time, I'm in London, you know it's gonna be pancake time! Oh, Lordy, Lordy! It turns out I do wanna roam again!",

The balance of sweet and savoury was just right, customer service was top notch, and the vibe was just chill. We were lucky enough to come early and avoid the queues, but with hindsight it's definitely worth the wait. At a cost of approx \u00a310.

Easy to find, it's in a nice little terrace behind the main road in Angel. \u00a0The place itself is quirky but I like quirky. The menu is extensive but I eventually went for the poached eggs on rye toast. I had that with the 'whiter than white' green tea. The tea was good, as were the eggs. As I was on my holidays, I decided to have a hot chocolate after my 'main' brekkie. \u00a0I was delighted when it came in a bright yellow mug with a smiley face on. It was good chocolate. The bill for all of the above cane to \u00a312.20 which I thought was a little on the expensive side. I realise this is central London and maybe this is the norm. I will definitely go back next time I need breakfast in Angel. The only point of note is that my friend told me that there are often queues at the weekends. I was there at 8.30 - 10 am on a Friday and it was fairly quiet.",

Nonetheless it was quite busy inside but it's very small and cramped so there aren't many tables for the 2 wait staff to worry about but they still managed to go long periods without stopping by or looking in our direction. They got my fianc\u00e9es order wrong but we'd waited so long she decided not to send it back. The food itself was actually very good, although I'd argue it's hard to not make a good sausage sandwich. My friend had the egg and avocado and porridge and he said they were decent but the sausage/bacon roll special is the way to go or the Full Monty breakfast judging by the table next to (almost on top of) us. As it's so cramped in there it's also really, really hot and we all left literally sweating. Waiting so long for our plates to be cleared and to pay didn't help. This place is comfortably a 4 based on food but the service really is bad. If there's a line I wouldn't bother waiting, try The Elk in the Woods next door instead.",

Our drinks - 2 smoothies and a cider - arrived fairly quickly. However, after 40 minutes hallucinating in the heat and watching three other tables being seated, fed (full meals) and fare-welled, we'd grown a little bored of waiting for a cupcake and plate of potato wedges. Even the two staff members entertaining themselves with a rendition of Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, while sipping cool, white wine, were becoming weary. Apparently, they'd forgotten about our food. Twice. Must have been the rush of blood to the head on Toes. Our meal, when it did arrive, wasn't too bad, and we didn't have to pay for the wedges. A free potato and super friendly (albeit slow) service are what got this place the extra star Go here to watch a musical and sweat, but probably not to eat.",

It's worth it though, with great food served by friendly staff and washed down by lovely smoothies or coffee. As the name suggests, the breakfasts are particularly good, with big portions and quality food. Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Having neglected to visit the Breakfast club for many months, i ended up here last weekend when a friend insisted that he liked this place more than Ottolenghi. After having breakfast there, i disagree.Sure the Breakfast Club is popular. We had to queue for more than half an hour to get in at around midday on a Saturday. The interior is not as tiny as the exterior led me to believe. They have a glass roof, which keeps the restaurant lit and warm at the same time ... a big positive in the middle of winter.The menu consists of standard English, American and Mexican breakfast dishes. I ordered the American pancake which, the menu said, \u00a0came with almost everything ... sausages, eggs, steak and bacon. I visualised an English breakfast on top of a pancake. It was almost like that (though the steak was absent). It was made well but i thought that the quantity of food was less than what one would expect from an almost \u00a310 price tag. My friend asked for huevos rancheros, which he liked. I tried some chorizos from his plate, which were delightful.The lack of variety among cocktails disappointed me. They primarily served (at least for breakfast) bloody marys and mojitos ... and i don't really like either. So i stuck with a banana milkshake, which was ok. My friend really liked his hot chocolate.The Breakfast Club is a good place to eat, and i shall probably return again. But it does not live up to the hype.",

    "text": "The Breakfast Club's Angel branch follows the line of the current tongue-in-cheek 80s revival. They offer breakfast and lunch and dinner options as well, which seems a bit less known as the place is packed with weekend brunchers but not too busy on weekdays. It has a bay window with some seats in it, which are perfect, sunny and overlook Camden passage. Free Wifi and plugs for computer make it a prime location to work a bit outside your own four walls. Good choice of music as well! As a regular, I have to admit though that the staff is not able to deliver a constant high quality service on every day of the week. Some days have a friendly, cool and attentive staff that makes you feel like a king. However, on other days the shift is forgetful and slow and seems to be selected more for their coolness than for their friendliness. (We had to tell one shift to empty the trash can of the juicer so that the fruit flies stop buzzing around our heads...) The same unequal performance is true for the dishes and portion control. So why give four stars for all these obvious faults? When at its best the Breakfast Club is one of the coolest hang-outs in London. Come in on the afternoon and treat yourself to a late breakfast or just a plain coffee, enjoy the unique blend between cafe and bar. Don't bother on the weekend, you are bound to be disappointed queuing for ages to get a slow service from an understaffed place. Instead, come in at the evening and chill out in the bay window.",

Having moved over from New York, I get an inescapable craving for brunch pancakes every few weeks - and this place serves some of the best that I've found in London. Omelettes and Breakfast Burritos? Also very tasty... served with a good amount of spice, tasty cheese, and very addictive home fries (hash browns). Yes, the service can be trying at times (I recently ate here for dinner, and flagging the waitress for the bill was something of an adventure); but on the whole, I do and will continue to keep coming back.",

Whether you prefer a healthy, low-calorie muesli, a full English breakfast, breakfast burrito or eggs Benedict in the morning, you'll find it here. There is something for everybody on the menu. If you want to try something unusual try poached eggs on toast. It is served with yummy homemade tomato chutney and comes with a fresh salad. I do believe however that the bread and pastry selection could be a bit more varied. In terms of service it is true that you'll never know what you'll get. Sometimes the staff is very attentive and quick and sometimes it takes ages for you cup of coffee to arrive. However, since the atmosphere of the place is so lovely and the food it outstanding I have always overlooked that flaw. I have been there on the weekends and you do have to be prepared for a queue and the vibe is not as relaxed, but if you go for a late breakfast at around 12, you'll have a great time. Only place were I ever went for breakfast alone and felt almost like at home!",

    "text": "I Have visited the breakfast club on 4 occasions. It is not too far from where I work. The location is excellent situated in the funky Camden Passage just up the road from Angel station. The d\u00e9cor of the Breakfast club is a hodge podge of different chairs and school tables, and the walls are washed with posters of Grease and other 80's movies. It is often very busy in here so a table can be hard to get at peak times. The waiting staff are smiley and welcoming, and try and sort out a table for you as quickly as possible. It is a tight squeeze when busy, so not great for intimate chats! The menu is what you would expect for a restaurant dedicated to the all day breakfasts, bacon and eggs, hash browns, as well as American style buttermilk pancakes to boot. You can also get a good range of Americana food like hamburgers and fries as well. The prices are rather high, I can't remember exact prices, but around 8 or 9 pounds for a breakfast which is what I have had the times I have been there. The quality of food is a bit poor, the cuts of meat and eggs seem low quality, especially considering the amount you pay for. Additionally I seem to have been very unlucky as out of the four times I have visited, I have had poorly cooked food. Eggs and potato have been undercooked; food and plates stone cold and pancakes dry and heavy. I am not a big eater, but found the portions to be a little on the small side as well. Having been to America on holiday a few times, I always have high hopes for that same Big Breakfast experience when I have visited The Breakfast Club, but unfortunately I think that I will have to wait until my next visit over the pond, as this venue is sorely lacking in the Breakfast department.",

The excellent atmosphere is made by a combination of the front window seats that hang over cute, cobbled Camden Passage, the collection of kitsch Americana, film posters, polaroids, board games and colourful wallpaper. The food is good too - consistently satisfying if sometimes unspectacular.Unfortunately I say 'used to be' because I've found that the service can be consistently mediocre and sometimes even poor. On more than one occasion I've had an order forgotten by a waiter and once I had to refuse to pay a bill because of the length of time I was left waiting for food. I've also witnessed other customers return meals for similar reasons.Its a real pity, because the prices are reasonable and the food, cocktails and atmosphere are all very pleasant.",

As for the food I was quite impressed with their hollaindase sauce, so you can't go wrong with any of those options. The pancake is more like a crepe but tastes good with maple syrup. I was thrown off and not too impressed with the falafel offered in Veggie all American meal. But overall good way to start of Sunday morning!",

It's cheerful, friendly and a great place to meet with friends or simply sit alone and read or write the afternoon away. I live south of the river and sometimes make the journey north simply on the merits of this little cafe. It makes me happy: it's a bit like a backpacker hostel/cafe that's got it just right, encapsulating an aura of positivity and open-mindedness with a good dose of humour too.Yes the jokes on the menu may seem silly to the London-weary eye, but why not make them? If you're in a good mood they're funny, and the Breakfast Club seems to have the aim of making its customers smile.I love the big sturdy wooden tables, the communal benches, the cheery yellow paint, and the lighting that seems has a great day-light/artifical mix. Despite it's breeziness, it is also cosy and a great place to nurse a hot drink on a winters day.I have spent hours at a time here - it's a good haven away from London's sometimes overwhelming pace. the staff have never made me feel as though I'm over-staying my welcome and have always been friendly and polite.And although the food is a little on the expensive side, it's good and filling, and the breakfast items are especially good.I first discovered the sister branch in Soho, which i also love, but it is this one that takes the crown. I usually come here for an afternoon but have had some good evening meals and breakfasts with friends too. In the summer it's also good to sit outside. Weekends can get really busy so I'd recommend a weekday if you can.",

I have been there twice and had to wait for a table on both occasions, but the food is good and reasonably priced for the area (could always be cheaper though). Because its small size, you always have to queue on weekends, so make sure you arrive as early as you can make it. My particular favourite is the Vegetarian All American, as it comes with savoury items as well as really yummy pancakes and maple sirup - a two course meal in one! The smoothies are good too, but if you are feeling less health-conscious or generous, the coffees are good too. I would definitely go there again, even if I wouldn't want to spend the cash every week.",
