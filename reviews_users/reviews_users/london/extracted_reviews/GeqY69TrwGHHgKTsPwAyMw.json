From the moment we walked in, the staff were so helpful and attentive and continued to be so throughout the evening-at times perhaps a little too much, one not totally empty glass was removed on my visiting the toilets.We had the set menu which was absolutely divine and my parents had non alcoholic fruit drinks instead of the complimentary wine, I was jealous of their amazing fruit cocktail which was something else! The flavours were amazingly combined in the most delightfully presented and interesting dishes. An expensive but definitely well worth it restaurant.",

    "text": "Benares is an uber posh curry. Now let's take stock here, and rewind a little bit. Can you think of an example where what is quintessentially a cheap thing has been done poshly successfully? All that springs to my mind are awful travesties such as designer shell suits, London Black cabs (it's a taxi, get over it) and Burberry check. A posh restaurant is great not because it's posh. Nor is it great because of all the obvious things it must do to justify the ticket price, like a pretty lady at the front and lots of marble within the first 10m of the entrance and designer flower arrangements. You've psyched yourself up for ponying up lots of cold hard cash, and from that point on your mind expects these things. What makes a posh restaurant great is all the little bits someone has painstakingly thought about that you would never think of. Like a waiter helping with your chair, even if you're a man, or a palate cleansing bit in between courses, brought up on a spoon to help enjoy the flavour more. Repeat a request? Never! It's the attention to these little touches which sets a restaurant from the rest, and performs the Jedi mind trick that ends with you saying Please take my money, this was unforgettable, and actually quite good value while coughing up 70 quid or more a head. I've had it happen, and it's great when it does. But sadly not at Benares. Think of Benares as the Burberry of restaurants. Much like making cheap nasty clothes in China and selling them for a packet through successful marketing, Benares takes what is at best a mediocre restaurant experience and tries to present it as something more. Curry was never meant to be this way. The food is no different from an average High Street curry joint, all apart from size of course. God forbid one should have big portions at a posh restaurants - that might eat into the margin. The decor fails the most simple of layout tests - when people pay more, everyone should be able to talk to everyone else at their table without having to shout. If you have to shout, the tables are too close together. Benares is like a stadium. Echoeey, loud and obnoxious. Like a poorly designed call centre automation system, the waiters are great if you know exactly what you want, it happens to be one of the options and you have no questions which require human interaction. Stray off the script at your peril. Have to repeatedly ask for something? Well, it is a very popular curry joint sir. Do yourselves a favour. If you want posh food and service, go somewhere that can provide them. If you don't mind the service and want the best curry you've ever had go to Lahore's in the East End. But why compromise and get the worst of both sides at Benares?",

That will set you back a minimum of \u00a335 per person before drinks. Yet my group's bar bill came up to more than the food bill! Service was excellent, but you would expect that.

We decided to get each of the non-vegetarian entrees and split them all up. In short, here's how I'd rank them: 1. Pan Seared Sea Bass with mushrooms and coconut sauce. **really excellent; perfectly cooked; coconut sauce was a nice compliment without overpowering the fish. Mushrooms were also very tasty. 2. Tandoori Tiger Prawns ** very, very good. Nice spicy rub with big, fresh prawns cooked perfectly. 3. Roasted Deer Fillet ** very tender and superbly favoured. Cooked just right. 4. Marsh Mutton Three Ways ** Great combination of flavors with the Hummus and Chickpeas. 5. Monkfish and Kofta ** Cooked nicely and flavorful. Good for seafood lovers. 6. Tandoori Chicken Supreme ** Good but lentil sprout salad added little; a bit forgetful. 7. Pan Fried Lobster Tail ** Yummy but a very small portion; Need the Naan to mop up the coconut sauce on this one. 8. Mallard Duck Supreme ** A bit tough and fatty but not bad by any means. Duck is duck. Overall, all eight had something to offer and you can't go wrong with any of them. The portions are all pretty small so what I thought was originally overindulgent by ordering the eight ended up not being so at all.",

I had the chicken liver which were roasted to perfection. My friends had the soft shell crab, which left me with a case of food envy! It was crispy, yet soft and quite sweet.I had the cod for main. It was presented on a rectangular ceramic plate with a fancy onion jous. Although the cod was spot on, I couldnt work out what made it an indian dish. Similarly, my friends had the venison, monkfish and rogan josh. All stated their food was lovely, but by simply using a spice here and there, we couldnt help but feel a little cheated. The staff were friendly, although i couldnt help but feel they were in excess. When going to the ladies, it was as though they were all lined up to guide us there! Sweet, but possibly a little overkill!Additionally, when my friend ordered the lamb rogan josh from the 'traditional' section, the waiter tried to convince her to have something more adventurous from the 'modern' section. He could have meant well, but his approach was rather agressive than advisory, which quite upset my friend.Overall, it was a nice evening, with the bill coming up to \u00a375 per head for four people, including drinks (of which two were \u00a310 cocktails).",

The location is good and entering the restaurant you are made to feel welcome, not a hint of the intimidation you sometimes get in 'posh' restaurants. Make no mistake, this is a posh restaurant, they try hard and are dedicated to flavour. The ambience is good even though it was a Monday lunchtime there were a scattering of other diners and the waiters were attentive and politely friendly. The 3 course menu was with matching wines by the glass and they were well selected and well explained by the wine waiter. The 3 courses showed imagination and were beautifully presented. The tastes were good, sometimes surprising, but all the cooking was just right. We all chose the salmon fishcakes as starter and they were crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and packed with flavour. The main for 3 of us was grey mullet - a difficult fish to cook. It was perfectly cooked and beautifully moist. The sauce was a flavour sensation and the 'Indian style' mash was lovely. For desert I had mango sorbet and vanilla and rum pannacotta - it was again beautiful and tasteful. The meal came with coffee or tea and petit fours which was a relaxed way to end the meal. Even on the fixed price menu the bill was over \u00a340 a head - but I reckon it was great value - wonderful tastes, beautiful presentation, great ambience, really good service. I would go again tomorrow and if you love good food so should you!",

We had a LOT of food - including their famous monkfish dish, but that should have been hint #1. \u00a0SInce when do you hear about MONKFISH at an Indian restaurant???Yes, the food is delicious, but this is NOT Indian food. \u00a0It's more fusion, with a very Indian twist. \u00a0While delicious, it wasn't the \"French Laundry\" type of delicious, and it wasn't the best in its field as far as I have tried, so I ding it one star to bring it to four stars.Their 3-course fixed menu for dinner is \u00a365 per person. \u00a0That is approximately $97. \u00a0You can pick a la carte, but there is a minimum of one appetizer and one entree per person. \u00a0Given the fact that none of us were interested in Indian desserts - we opted for the latter. \u00a0That, combined with 2 bottles of wine, 2 dessert wines, and 2 scotches at the end, came to a whopping \u00a3550. \u00a0$825, folks. \u00a0This breaks down to a $200+ per person meal. \u00a0It was good, but it wasn't THAT good. \u00a0For business purposes, I would go to Benares again, but NEVER again for my ONE INDIAN MEAL in London. \u00a0That was a big mistake, but it was my own fault for not checking into it first. \u00a0They have it all for the meat lover and vegetarian, and everything on the menu sounds exquisite. \u00a0Excepting the kebab appetizer and the chicken entree that one of us ordered, I thought everything was very tasty - especially the potato pancakes, and my Indian cottage cheese dish.Order the dessert Riesling - - it's a wonderful finish to a good, and extraordinarily expensive meal. \u00a0But do remember, I said it here loud and clear - - this is NOT Indian food!",

Everything started well, we ordered a couple of delicious cocktails and sat in the empty but quite nice bar. we were then seated at our table and decided to go for a. the tasting menu and b. the more expensive 45 year old chenin blanc. Both turned out to be errors. The tasting menu was extremely hit and miss, one of the courses was 3 jars of what i can only describe as horrible tasting fish. one course was delicious (a selection of indian spiced meats). the main course of obligatory curry was meh. The expensive wine was both syrupy sweet and not as nice my the 2011 which would have been a lot cheaper. In a way it's unfair to give benares 2 stars, the home made bread is divine, but after having been to Veeraswami and Amaya, this one falls very short of the mark for me.

The prix fixe menu offers you a choice of three starters, mains and desserts, and costs \u00a324.95 including a glass of wine, coffee and petit fours (\u00a319.95 for two courses). First to come were some mini poppadoms served with a variety of sweet relishes, none of which, sadly, were up to a fiery lime pickle or a sweet mango chutney dished out in every Indian restaurant around the country. Particularly disappointing was the carrot dip. Avoid. However, from this point the experience picked up considerably. The shot of spicy tomato soup was beautifully smooth, and my starter of pepper and fennel crusted squid salad was exquisite. The main of King Fish fillet with chilli garlic mash and coriander sauce was also very good, if slightly dry. My white chocolate mouse pudding with banana and basil sorbet was possibly the highlight. My friend's chicken supreme was possibly a better bet, and came with a lovely makhani sauce. The coffee, too was a little sub-standard. All in all, good value for what you get, but if you want Michelin star dining, I'd stick to Chez Bruce.",

Tawae ke paneer, pyaz ka laccha and the usual dals and aloo are all beautifully executed. Clean, smart decor and smooth and knowledgeable service (there's even a sommelier) make this one of the best Indian restaurants in London. Good for business too - although there's no wi-fi offered (a growing peeve, since with the advent of the iPhone, one often wants to access information quickly when at a business lunch. The network password could be posted on the menu or be freely accessible, as at The Ship on Wandsworth Bridge).",

    "text": "I suspect my expectations and opinions of this establishment are heavily influenced by my background where I am lucky enough to have first class Indian food at home whenever my mum steps to the hob. Nonetheless I am aware of the fine-dining interpretation of the sub-continent offered here and can vouch for Atul Kochar being a thoroughly nice bloke. But... this should have been better. So much better.The doorman had an unfriendly aspect and did little to make us feel welcome on arrival. The pair of ladies on the front desk were but the first bloom of excess in the restaurant's bloated seasonal staff as we met at least 10 of them during the course of our experience.The amuse bouche was a small potato bhajia on apple salad. The bhajia was overly spiced with cumin and the apple was insipid in its neutered pickling which did little to offset the overbearing hit of cumin - not great. We also had mini poppadoms with a selection of chutneys - apple and ginger, tomato, and finally pineapple. The poppadoms were not cracklingly fresh mastication tended to result in your teeth feeling glued together. The chutneys were fine but all much of a muchness, it would have been good to have one which was more chilli and mustard seed than base notes of savoury with an overly sweet spotlight.Both had the fish sheekh kebab to start and this was lovely - reminiscent of the tandoori crab kebab at veeraswamy - but with a lovely green chutney sauce and side salad. The garlic mayo was served generously whilst the green sauce was spitefully smeared on the plate - a pity because this combined with the spicing of the fish was very tasty.Mai was the sea bass - very well cooked with exquisitely crisp skin but not particulary flavoursome - served in a sauce of raw coconut onion and turmeric with some random courgettes and vine tomatoes... Strange combo! The paratha served with it was lovely and appetisingly brushed with ghee - this tasted like home at least. The problem with the parath and indeed the wine is that it is not served with the food so you have to wait around for the accompaniments which are ameant to compliment the food - sloppy. I had the matched wines for the starter and main and I could not catch the name of the first which was okay but the gew\u00fcrztraminer accompanying the main was full bodied and vibrant - perfectly matched.Dessert was a lychee kulfi in a milky berry sauce with plastic-textured vermicelli... I am unsure how this dish came to be conceived but the vermicelli proved a weak point as it was poorly executed and incongruous with the falouda-lite nature of the dish. Gulab jamun brulee was billed as a deconstructed gulab jamun - all of the ingredients in the form of a brulee. Unfortunately the main ingredient is milk powder and so the only real taste in the dish was the black cardamaom which was nice enough but only in smaller doses than offered here.Petits Fours were nice but again the cumin was all up in your grill!Overall I am judging this place a bit more harshly but that is because at this level and at this price it should be excellent and it just wasn't. Felt as if a lot of the experience was contrived to eke out more and more money, a flat fee of \u00a35 for sides is steep when you consider you may be charged that for sundries such as naan or even rice - not too clever in an indian restaurant IMHO. Still worth a try if you are curious but I would temper expectations before chancing the threshold.",

The devil is in the detail they say... The cocktail list itself was a very nice read, although I must say they were slightly over-priced (12\u00a3 minimum).The rest of the dinner went very well, the service kept a high level throughout the night, bringing us our food swiftly and reacting well to demands.The wine we selected (South African) was exquisite, and after 20 minutes breathing was a good companion to all of our dishes.The starters and mains (the menu mentions you have to order minimum 2 dishes...) are of great quality. My crab meat was shaped as a crab, and the spicy was never too hot.Likewise, the venison with a bitter chocolate vindaloo sauce could not have been any better cooked or seasoned.However, I kept feeling the prices were slightly exaggerated and exponential (rising quickly from 24\u00a3 to 87\u00a3 !).Yet the portions were reasonable and we left the restaurant quite satisfied.",

When gathered they too got cocktails and we were shown our table.After 15 minutes we were given the menus, then we were asked 3 times in 10 minutes if we were ready to order!We were given a delightful amuse bouche shortly after ordering.The starters arrived promptly and the soft shell crab was certainly very good.The starters were cleared and the main course arrived in good time, except for the dall, we asked about this to be told it was just coming. We waited a moment then decided to start. We were over half way through when we asked again for the dall... ...it's just coming! By the time it arrived we'd almost finished.Pretty full we decided to skip desert and have a tea.The tea took over 30 minutes to arrive, when it did it was wrong, they had to take it back. 10 minutes later they brought the correct teas.After tea we asked for the bill, 10 minutes passed before it arrived. We immediately got our cards out to pay. Someone came with the card machine, a waiter smashed a glass and the guy with the card machine disappeared. He then collected payment from 2 other tables so we got up and walked to the bar to pay.This is not the service you expect at a Michelin starred restaurant, especially one work over a waiter per table head count. Needless to say at \u00a3100 per head they didn't get the \u00a350 optional service charge!The food is up to the billing the service is worse than Pizza Hut.",

    "text": "I was really struggling with whether to give Benares two or three stars. It was a nice meal and with 35\u00a3 for a three course set menu, value for money. The Michelin star however raised expectations (so perhaps this is not fair as I would have rated differently without it). Having traveled in India, both north and south, I have had food that blows your socks off; and being anywhere else than the UK I would have forgiven mediocre Indian food. However, in the town where Tikka Masala is called a national dish, I expect to have the best.About the food: We started off well with some small round Papadams accompanies by three different chutneys: Pineapple, apple and tomato. \u00a0Especially the spicy pineapple chutney was great and a good start to a fusion Indian meal. The starters, two different types of kebabs, were acceptable with clear notes of India merged in nice presentation of the food. Especially the fish kebabs were delicious with yummy chili mayonnaise and pickles. It was the main dish that dropped the mood. The chicken with lentil sauce I ordered was dry and dull in taste. Nothing like the juicy, soft chicken you get in India, or at least a good Indian restaurant. If something, Indians know how to make their chicken. The Naan bread that was served as a side was also dry, and where was the butter? I like my Naan soaked in lovely grease, but in this case the naan was plain and tasteless! By now, I'm sure many fans of the restaurant think that I should have gone to Tooting for my meal, and I agree =). This was clearly just not my thing. Well it gets a bit better from here, the dessert was great . It was a chocolate ball, housing a lovely chocolate mousse with raspberries on the side. Not too sweet, but full and creamy. The presentation was also very impressive, very beautiful. Taste-wise I would give it five stars, but it had nothing to do with India. Also the dessert enjoyed by my date, apple crumble, was far from matching the theme. I had a peak at the A La Carte list and there the desserts seem to (at least the names and descriptions) have more in common with the appropriate cuisine, so perhaps it was a punishment for going for the set menu. We also got some lovely pralines to finish the meal.About the drinks: I am not a fan of pairing wine with Indian (or other spicy) food, so went for a nice Cobra beer. I was a bit disappointed that there was only two beers on the drinks menu: Cobra and something else I just cannot remember. With a rising boutique beer industry, I would have hoped for more selection. The cocktails served to the tables next to us looked however yummy. If not for an early morning the next day I would have continued with \u00a0a nice Mumbai Martini or a Masala Sour =).About the service: The service was very friendly. There were quite many different waiters serving us, but it did not seem to take the quality down. In the end however, we had to wait for the bill quite long. We had arrived early for dinner (6:30pm) and the restaurant was now filling up, and you could really see the effect. When we finally got our bill, there was annoyingly an extra charity charge included. I have nothing against charity, however I appreciate if I am asked before if I would like to contribute. It felt a bit like someone was trying to trick me by sneaking the 1\u00a3 in (I'm sometimes a bit lazy to look at anything other than the end sum). Regardless of the small sum, we asked the charity to be removed, which is not that nice to do.All in all, the experience was not too bad, but clearly not to my taste. I would not go to Benares again, but in case someone is interested, I would recommend choosing bits and pieces from the A La Carte list. The set menu was value for money, however not the most authentic experience if you are looking for something special.",

    "text": "Surprisingly disappointing. Mixed performance on service, over-priced food, and tastes that left me wanting. Don't get me wrong: the cuisine here is good. Chicken Tikka Pie was an inventive take on the traditional Anglo/Indian favorite. But for the price I was paying, I expected more than just an interesting idea: the filling was dry, the dish devoid of an accomapnying sauce that could have made it exceptional, the crust itself slightly overcooked. Similarly, my Romney Mutton \"Three Ways\" could easily have been more than it was: again, it felt a little bit like a sauce problem, where garnishes didn't add to the meat as much as they could have. I ordered some spicy tomato chutney to help round out the meal (and paid handsomely for it...), but it came too late and was relegated to Naan dipping sauce.For a Michelin 1* that charges 30+ GBP for mains, I expect more. I expect attentive, consistent service - and did not receive it. I expect food that is both creatively conceived and well executed. I'm only starting to get to know the higher-end British Indian scene, so perhaps my expectations are too high (and I'll have to revise this review upwards in a few months) - but I've got to think that Benares could have been better. We'll see. In the interim, 3*.",

    "text": "Before heading to Benares, I'd seriously advise heading down to your local Indian a few days beforehand. A week before my visit, I'd had a perfectly pleasant, tasty meal at a thoroughly decent curry house in my area. It made me appreciate just how good Benares is. From the mini-poppadums to the delicious kulfis, this place is an absolute triumph. In my head, I keep a note of the best places I've ever eaten. This makes it into the top three. It's hard to talk about the food without going into raptures and dribbling a lot at the thought of eating it again. It's a wondering my keyboard hasn't given up the ghost with all the moisture I'm dripping onto it Our starters of fishcakes with mushy peas were delicious and light but with a neat tang that wasn't overwhelming and set us up nicely for the mains. Chicken tikka leg was infused with a fantastic array of flavours that played merrily on your tongue while the sea bass ranks among the finest treatments I've experienced with this fish. Add to this the aforementioned Kulfis and it was perfection from start to finish. What's more, special praise has to be reserved for the exceptional service. One of our party has a tricky set of food allergies to cook around. Despite being on a London Restaurant Week deal, the staff were incredibly helpful, ensuring that we knew exactly what was and wasn't safe, and going out of their way to help change any of the dishes that needed changing. In many years of restaurant and pub visiting I've never experienced service quite as helpful in such a high end restaurant as Benares. As we paid the bill, and said, politely, that we'd love to return, our waiter helpfully pointed out which meals wouldn't affect the allergies. Not that there was any question about returning some day, anyway, but it's little things like this that, combined with the food, make Benares a winner.",

We ordered a selection of dishes, which were all delicious, the dessert was the only thing that I didn't care for (and I have a sweet tooth!). As we had the tasting menu, what was really nice was that when the waiters served each dish, they explained what it was (you also get a glass of wine with each course, but I couldn't comment on that as I don't drink alcohol!). As we were leaving, one of the waiters showed us what the chef's table was like (it's a room for 6 people with two glass walls allowing diners to see the kitchen team at work) - would be perfect for a special occassion.

    "text": "So first time here having seen Atul Kochhar on the tv on many occasions I was very excited to actually go to this resturant.The actual setting was very easy on the eye and very well polished from the time we went through the front door to the time we left. The lady on the door was very polite and well turned out. The decor has its light and dark areas and unlike some restaurants is not so dark you cannot see the person across the table without leaning over and I always find that to be a plus. The background sounds were not intrusive so definitely no shouting to be done to have a conversation.We had a very nice champagne cocktail to start with along side the mini popadoms and a selection of dips to go with them. As to be expected in an establishment of this nature there was a waiter to take your wine order and a different one to take your food order. It was quiet when we arrived as we were their for lunch so perhaps that is why by the time we left we had been looked after by at least four different waiting staff, but it was not a problem as none were intrusive and it never affected our order.Whilst the portions are not large they most certainly hit the spot for both taste and quantity. For some people out their the first two courses would have constituted a meal (we had a four course meal ) surprisingly for an Indian resturant the deserts were very good.All in all I would definitely go back and try something else on the menu as what I had was all very tasty. The only downside I guess is that the main man was no where to be seen . I guess everyone gets a day off at some stage.",

    "text": "Oh dear. It seemed like the Benares emperor wasn't wearing any clothes on Saturday eve. I was excited to go and try the private dining experience at Atul Kochhar's place for one of my best mate's birthdays, and indeed the room itself, like the rest of the restaurant, looks beautiful. Classy black lacquer with red and gold trimmings, and some dark pretty fretwork separating us from everyone else. We were in the largest room with about 24 people but I believe it can seat up to 36ish and there are other smaller rooms available too.The service is unobtrusive in a good way (i.e. not just absent!) and feels nicely personalised, as they knew the seating plan in advance and thus people's choices between the veg or non-veg set menu. Starters were individually plated; the plaintain kebab was delish and left me wanting more, whilst the salmon was just average in terms of flavour. Main course was more generous portion-wise as it was served family-style to share, but nothing actually stood out taste-wise for me. And that's even after looking past the 'my mum could make this at home for a fraction of the price' type snobbery that I'm sure a lot of asian people get when eating at high-end asian places. My mum could have made it at home for a fraction of the price *and* many multiples more flavourful!If I was choosing the best of the average bunch it would be the kadhai paneer dish, but overall I was disappointed that none of the food excited me. Well the 'chocolate rasmalai' dessert did in name, but turned out to be standard plain rasmalai with choc ice cream on the side. The cherry on top of the disappointment was when the bill was split equally, which I'm usually fully in favour of for simplicity, plus few things make me as painfully uncomfortable as people who squabble down to the last few quid, but not when it turned out others were ordering \u00a360 bottles of wine. In hindsight I should totally have got involved with that. 3-course set menu of at-best-average food (\u00a352pp) plus a glass of wine plus a mint tea and I paid \u00a380. Ouch.I wouldn't blame the restaurant for the bill-splitting carnage but even at the standard set menu price I think this place needs a serious reality check. I'm being generous with a third star for the place being so lush and the service being on point, but I have experienced far, far better.",

    "text": "I booked this place 2 months in advance for my better halfs birthday, and cause he's allergic to a few things, I went overboard with the emails and phonecalls to confirm everything. On the day of arrival we were greeted by the lovely staff team who kindly took our coats and wet brollys. Sat at the bar and enjoyed a few drinks before being seated in the dining room.Started off with a glass of Laurent Perrier champagne which is my absolute fave, finished that like it was water. The waitress then came for our second order and ordered the Passionfruit Chutney Martini (benares signature created by the chef himself) and the Bollywood. Passionfruit chutney martini was beautiful, strong but appetising, However the Bollywood, if you like your drink strong, then i'd highly recommend this. I could not finish it as it was just a tad too much for me! For starters we ordered Murg Tiranga - Trio of Free Range Chicken: Tikka, Chutney Grilled, Crispy Wing, Paneer Tiranga - Cottage Cheese Three Ways and corn fritters. Before our starters was served we received our Amuse Bouche - Seasonal Vegetable Shami, Mulligatawny Soup. Loved the amuse bouche, what a nice way to start the meal off, light, gets you in the mood for all the food to arrive. I loved all our starters, especially the paneer which came with little pipettes with chutney in them. The chicken was cooked to perfection, loved the tikka, and the wing, however, not so much the grilled - tasted slightly weird and off. The amritsari corn fritters are a nice way to end the meal with a little bit of spice, the black salt really helps ooze all those flavours and blend into one. The service throughout was very attentive, the waiters had remembered my other half allergies, water was always topped up, not too intrusive, we got to enjoy a beautiful meal properly, just the way it should be.For mains we ordered Aloo Benares - Tempered Baby Potatoes, Asafoetida, Cumin and Ginger and Dal - Dal Makhni or Tempered Yellow Lentils with buttered naans. Good portions, not overloaded in a big bowl, definitely enough for two. The best dal makni I have had by far, the aromas took me back to India. The aloo benares didn't quite hit the spot, but it was a good accompaniment to have on the table. Table was cleared up quickly and ordered dessert, my favourite part of the meal :) and chose the Dark Chocolate Mousse, Passion Fruit and Hot Chocolate Sauce, which is basically a chocolate sphere, inside that sits Vanilla Gelato and Chocolate Mousse. Smeared on the plate a passionfruit puree, with passionfruit pate de fruit and a few berries sitting nicely. The waiter poured the hot chocolate sauce on top of the sphere and slowly but surely it melted gracefully, opening the mousse and gelato for our viewing. Definitely the best dessert on their menu, if you want a perfect ending, this is it!!! And yes it tasted amazingly delicious, hats off to the pastry chef, everything was paired perfectly!!! If you like Indian food, this is definitely the place, its not mums cooking, but its a modernised, refined version. I loved it, and so did my other half. Definitely will be returning one day soon.",

    "text": "I came here on a recommendation from a local chef, whom I got to know a little bit. We discussed how Indian food had been so assimilated into British life that chicken tikka masala is now considered a national dish of the UK. Naturally, after so much talk, I was craving Indian food, and so he recommended this place that is one of his favorites, which has a really unique twist on Indian food.Details:1) Came for a pre-show dinner, reservation seating @5.30p. 2) Ordered the 2-course prix fixe meal (29 GBP) - a little pricey. 3) Sipped on a refreshing glass of Gewurztraminer while I absorbed the ambiance of the restaurant.YAY -- It's all about the food:1) Amuse bouche - spinach cake stuffed with apricot with mild green chutney. Who doesn't love a delicious freebie?2) Papadum with chutneys (gooseberry, spicy tomato, and mango). I had to consciously stop eating these or I would ruin my dinner. 3) 1st course - cauliflower assortment. I never thought I would get so excited over cauliflower, but every bite of this amazing assortment was packed with flavor: white cauliflower roasted with parmesan, purple vinegar cauliflower, cauliflower puree, and pickled cauliflower. YUM.4) 2nd course - roasted sea bream with masala chips, basmati rice, lentil soup, and whole wheat naan.UGH --Not so great on the service:Service here is off, uncoordinated, inefficient, etc. When I was seated, the waiter made multiple interruptions, like 4-5 trips, just bring menus and water. 2 separate waiters waited on me at first and didn't communicate with each other beforehand. Then by the end of the dinner, I didn't have any specified waiter at all, and I had to wave someone down to get the check. All in all, there just needs to be some level of consistency with the service to have a really fabulous experience. So why 4 stars? Because the food was just that good. Really. I would go back for the food, and more of it!",

    "text": "Pretty solid restaurant, though I expect much more of a Michelin star bearing one. \u00a0I'm always nervous about eating at an upscale desi (south Asian) restaurant, as a desi American who finds the most satisfyingly authentic food at restaurants with failing health inspection grades; but I was generally happy with the experience at Benares. I came here with a large group. \u00a0Full disclosure, I was not paying, and I don't think I would come back on my own dime (just too pricey for what you get food wise). We had our own private dining area which was very pretty, and intimate. The service was quite attentive and helpful with recommendations and questions about the menu. What I especially liked was that though not catering primarily to a desi audience, the restaurant wasn't sort of \"sanitized\" of its desiness. I spoke to the staff in Urdu, and they were all well-informed of the cuisine and made separate suggestions for palates more experienced with the cuisine. The food was good. - Seekh kabaab appetizer-- yummy, big portion, good texture, but not anything special- soft shell crab appetizer - delicious, nice texture and flavors, unusual dish but highly recommend- chicken tikkah - shared a whole chicken tikkah with one other person; the chicken was juicy and well cooked, but I think the seasoning was a bit lacking, and I wasn't blown away - bread- paratha was all right, but I thought it was the weakest item we tried. they brought us whole wheat and regular, as well as some naan. The paratha wasn't super buttery and flakey as it should be, but decent. The awesome thing was that they had a gluten free bread option for our gluten intolerant diner. - side dishes: we also had some daals and veggies which were good but not memorable (I actually can't remember what we got)- dessert - had the kulfi three ways; it was okay. Overall, though I had a good experience and the food was fine, I found the restaurant to be underwhelming.",

    "text": "Ever get the sensation that you're the last sane person in a world that's gone slightly cuckoo? That's what I felt after browsing the online reviews after dining at Benares. A couple of friends and I, desperate to escape the annual treadmill of office Christmas lunches in perfectly satisfactory but uninspiring chain restaurants, booked a table at Benares and ordered the tasting menu. Not unreasonably, we were expecting quite some meal for our \u00a386 per person (excluding drinks). Indeed, as I sit here typing, I'm catching up with an episode of Masterchef, Sean Pertwee's sandy tones emphasising that for this kind of money, diners expect perfection. What we got was an expensive reality check. Listed as a 7 course menu, it's actually only five courses - the Spinach and Apricot tikki was barely large enough to count as an amuse bouche, and personally, I've never eaten anywhere that lists the palate cleansing sorbet as a separate course (and nor would I want to). Pleasant enough but hardly revolutionary, it set the tone for the rest of the evening. The softshell crab in the second course, was probably one of the best dishes of the meal, but nothing I haven't had elsewhere, and the fripperies on the plate (apple jelly prime among them) appeared to be the product of fancying up the plate, not an integral part of the dish. The subsequent chicken dish was again fine, albeit underseasoned in places, and desperately crying out for an accompanying carb - and I wasn't happy to find myself chewing through some cartilage. The salmon dish, as tiny and bland as its predecessors, was saved by a rich curry sauce and (finally) a (dessert) spoonful of gratefully received rice. It wasn't until the penultimate course (lamb rump, chickpea masala sauce and a samosa, with a side of black dahl) that we were finally served a reasonable portion of food. The small but well cooked hunk of lamb and parathas were most welcome, but accompanied by a masala sauce that was not just under- but badly seasoned, and hadn't been cooked out long enough. By the time the dessert showed up (a rose and raspberry confection with yoghurt and crunchy freeze dried raspberries, albeit accompanied by something parading as, but oh so far from pistachio burfi) miserly portion, but easily the best dish of the day).Even setting aside the paucity of the portions and the chronic underseasoning, the rest of the experience was grinding enough to leach us of our Christmas spirit - the disinterested waiters (verging on the rude - at times they were pretty much throwing cutlery and plates down on the table), the endless wait between courses, the watermarks and thumb prints on the plates and the food and so, endlessly, on. These might sound like persnickety things to pick up on, but at \u00a3125 a head I am, frankly, baffled by the whole experience. Even having become irked enough to tell the waiter point blank that the burfi served with the dessert course was inedible (stale chewing gum is the closest we came to describing it), we were met with aloof indifference. I have tasted some magnificent Indian cooking in my time, professional and homemade, and I wouldn't rank this experience anywhere near them. Not only am I unable to comprehend how that was a Michelin starred experience, I am downright flummoxed as to how Benares has clung on to even one star - I've had infinitely superior service and tastier meals at my local eateries. I'm certainly done with Mr. Kocchar's establishments, and frankly the Michelin system if they're content to dole out stars for such mediocre fare.",

Because it could seem pretentious, because the idea of Indian Fusion makes the hair on my neck rise, because it's above a Rolls Royce and Bentley dealership; because the bar at the top of the stairs looks like an empty, Vegas lounge bar that is no longer in vogue, or maybe even because I work in the same building and I'm looking for an excuse not to blow the expense account.The thing is, I don't.The food is fun, interesting and good. The Pisco sours are excellently mixed (i.e., the barman seems to know what he's doing). The chicken curry is delicious. The tandoori John Dory fish is normally served on the bone, but they will gladly de-bone it for you, and it tastes amazing. The nan is delicious.Is it over priced ? Yes, absolutely?Is it good ? Yes, absolutely?Is it good value; that's up to you to make up your mind. For me it isn't, but as a few reviewers below, I'm biased; my mom makes Indian food, so I don't go actively seeking Indian fare when I'm out dining. However, I'll give it 4 stars, for proximity to the office, excellent service, decent food (providing you make the right choice), and good drinks menu.",

The waitstaff did a great job, as expected for such an upscale restaurant.We both had the tasting menu and I opted for the wine pairing while my fianc\u00e9e stuck with her drink from the bar.The stand-out course was the seared scallop, which was delicious. Everything else was executed well, but not impressive. In fact, the main course of lamb was dry and a bit tough - a grave error. There were two options for the wine pairing and I opted for the slightly less expensive of the two. All of the wines served were good, but nothing stood out enough to merit seeking out a bottle of the stuff. For the price we paid, we expected better in terms of food. Otherwise, the experience was average for this type of restaurant. Hence, we deduct one star from the average three to arrive at a final verdict of two.",

    "text": "Disappointing. Really. When you are a highly recommended, Michelin Star, Indian restaurant in London people get excited. We made reservations weeks in advance, specifying the tasting menu for four at that time. When we arrived they had no idea we had confirmed the tasting menu in our reservation. Once the food began to arrive it looked lovely, but was completely lacking in creativity, depth, flavor and spice. The main course was lamb which was nicely grilled, but had raw masala on the meat. Many flavors felt more European than Indian. Have they attempted to reach a non-Indian audience with a compromise in their recipes? The service was the biggest weakness. A tasting menu comes with the expectation of discovery and flavor. We wanted to experience the breadth of food your chef has to offer but instead got a string of surprisingly similar grilled options. We often had no idea what we were being served (is that salmon on pink trout?) and the staff were preoccupied with others. \u00a0After our three hour fifteen minute meal we were sort of abandoned before they remembered our dessert. Then we had to ask for the check three times, finally hailing the manager in desperation. Pretty big disappointment after our anticipation of a Michelin Star experience meal. One of our guests actually said, \"We should have ordered take out from our local Indian place, would have been better.\"",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Indian food in London being Indian myself. This Michelin rated restaurant was highly recommended to us by our hotel concierge. Although the restaurant only had three other tables seated, we were told we had to sit at one of two top tables because they would be getting busy Which we did not see even at the time we were leaving.The service was not worth a Michelin rated service and what we've come to expect when a restaurant is rated such as that. The service was sparse and slow and although we had told him that I was vegan, he ended up recommending dishes that had dairy which I had to tell him there was dairy in it. We ended up ordering an appetizer and a main which were all just very bland and almost seemed like they were curated with just the spices of india and lacked taste. I was so disappointed with the taste that most of the food was left on the plates. The English pea tiki was the best thing I had and it was just okay. The cauliflower had a raw masala taste and the potatoes which looked like it was taste phenomenal were so sad when it came to seasoning. Pretty to look at with no depth or flavor. That was the theme of the food. Although I appreciate that they had a gluten-free flatbread, the food was just not what I was expecting in London especially for a Michelin rated meal.",

Dined solo around 9:15pm on a weekday and it was packed as I was getting seated so knew that was a good sign.I was pretty quickly brought the restaurants version of popped chips with 3 different chutneys. This was a great way to start off the meal (I was ravenous!) after ordering my appetizer and main, I was served an amuse bouche - pumpkin fritter with lemon dip underneath. This was delicious!Next up was the Jerusalem artichoke appetizer with paneer and parsnips with a romesco dip. This was absolutely to die for. The flavors went so well together. Wish I asked for a paired wine with this course. For the entree, the waiter suggested I try the most popular dish, which was the smoked tandoori lamb chops with a bold glass of red. These paired perfectly together. The lamb was SO tender. Wish there were more.Would love to do the tasting menu next time or try more dishes if dining with someone else.",

He's not a fan of Indian food, but he knows that I absolutely love Indian food! I loved their chicken tikka masala. I got it spicy but it wasn't spicy at all. The chef made it as spicy as possible but it was still not spicy. Regardless, it was absolutely delicious. It was the best chicken tikka masala I've ever had! Also, their butter chicken was fabulous! They have samosas on the vegetarian menu and they were so good! Get the mango lassi too! Omg. Everything was absolutely fabulous and perfect. I would highly suggest coming to Benares if you're ever in London! It's totally worth it. They also have very unique items on their menu that you won't be able to find at any other Indian restaurant in the world. They also brought us a beautiful dessert for our special day, but I'm sure that my fianc\u00e9e called ahead of time. It's also very hard to get a reservation to this restaurant!",

We tried a couple appetisers including the vegetarian sampler which was quite good. For the main, I had the seafood stir fry which was nicely spiced with a variety of seafood.

The lamb was tender and the spices just right, a lovely contrast with the very fresh grilled gem lettuce. For main I ordered the seam bream with kokum sauce and this was just wow! The fish was beautifully cooked and I could have licked my plate to waste none of this sauce! I finished my meal with the date and sticky pudding with bayleaf ice cream. One of the best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had and the bayleaf ice cream a revelation with this sugary dessert.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to eat in a Michelin restaurant and with my friend's recent 30th birthday party, I got the chance to. Benares delivers on all fronts, from the fantastic decor to the inventive cocktail menu to the food which is quite simply divine. The service is something I have never come across before and our party of approximately 50 people were taken care of as though we were royalty. The menu takes care of meat-eaters and vegetarians alike and there are some lovely combinations that you just have to try. The desert menu was also a lovely surprise with traditional Inidan treats like kulfi being reinvented and served. The price does make it a restaurant that the average person is more like to keep for a special occasion rather than weekly entertainment, but at no point did I feel ripped off. The value here is bestowed upon you from the second you set foot in the door. My tip is to always make reservations, but then also arrive 30 minutes earlier and spend some time in the bar area next to the lovely water features. You won't regret having a drink here!",
