They need to sort out their staff issues. \u00a0What could have been a perfect meal was ruined by whatever was going on with the staff that night.",

As they don't take bookings, this probably isn't a bad thing at all. Order the huitlacoche quesadillas, the pork pibil and the fuerza salad. Try to convince your fellow diners that the black bean and chicken soup is 'yes, nice, good..' rather than revealing that it's amazing so you don't have to share it with them. I've become a tequila convert now and it's all Wahaca's fault - what they have on offer is a far cry from the student experiences that most of us associate with that particular beverage. Try the aged ones at the end of your meal. Leave room for churros. We didn't, and now we have to go back. Ack, what a chore...",

Anyway, one of my boyfriend's favourtie foods ever which we had in California was fish tacos, and I haven;t found them here. Wahaca probably comes closest. The food is good - tasty, good size portions to try lots of items (I'd recommend the tasting plate for two, it's plentiful and good). The soft tacos are the only ones I've had in London which taste like, erm, soft tacos - it's the corn, I think. Anyway, yum. The atmosphere in the restaurant is also good, we were in a large group and were well looked after. However, afterwards, we headed up to the bar which was FREEZING - due to being made not-quite-airtight with a piece or transparent tarp - and EMPTY. The girl behind the bar served us with complete indifference, which seemed a bit odd since we were the only people there and you'd think she'd at least like having something to do to keep her warm. (Honestly, I had to sit under the heat lamp I was so cold). So - good food, I'll definitely go back, but I wouldn't bother with the bar.",

Brand new to Canary Wharf is Wahaca, yay, wooh, Mexican food.... Ehhhh wah wah Wahaca, you are such a disappointment. Firstly I hate that you put red onion in your guac, this is no place for overpowering onion evilness. 2. Your waiters are far too concerned about what 'section' tables are in, if you aren't in their section, you are dead to them. This is not how you run a restaurant. C. Your fish tacos are crap. Three measly bits of fish gougon on a cold tortilla with far too much lettuce and a teaspoon of sauce is not what I was hoping for. I will conceded the portion of rice and beans was tasty. Conclusion: Waited ages to order and your food is admittedly fresh tasting, but eating a plate of lettuce will always feel airy, won't it? I'm sure one day I will find something at Wahaca that I like, so will probably try again in a couple of months. If anything, they have churros!",

The waiters are great - on the ball and fast. In all our visits (possible 20+) we had one bad situation with a hair in our food. Through no fault of their kitchen (the deserts are apparently from a factory and delivered daily), they apologised profusely and offered a kind discount for this. I'd have no problem eating here again despite that as the pulled pork burrito is wonderful. If they could always be stupidly juicy each time - that would be the icing on the cake. Maybe I should ask if that's possible next time!",

    "text": "I'm rounding up the star-age here, because, well, yay, I'm a fan, especially of the fish tacos, which are far from perfection, but get at least an A- for effort. I'm not going to lie here, I'm pretty awesome at eating Mexican food. I've lived in the Bay Area (props to El Charro) San Francisco (Mission = Mexican food heaven) and San Diego, which, in my opinion, arguably has better fish tacos than, well, Mexico. (Although it wouldn't stop us from taking a day-trip to Ensenada or Porto Nuevo, a small fishing village south of Tijuana that had an amazing lobster tail taco special. Ok, maybe that was the best.)Anyway, back to reality. \u00a0Back to London, where a poor avocado tree would die of depression before it died of frost in the dark, dark cold winter afternoons. Back to Wahaca. So, with all that in mind, the first time I had the fish tacos I thought they were pretty a-ok, a little too heavy on the battering and they were kind of smallish and looked like fish sticks. But they tasted good, and had plenty of chipotle-mayo sauce stuff on top. The side slaw was great outside and inside the taco, and the side of black beans, cilantro rice and sour-ed (why not just \"sour,\" people?) cream was a tasty combo. Hence, I ate the entire plate. And I was stuffed.On my second visit, I wanted to try something else, but fell into the tractor beam of the fish taco plate again, and this time, the fish sticks, still over battered, were slightly bigger, and the tacos were messy but delicious in addition to the sides. Again, plate was clean. And for less than 8 GBP for a filling and tasty meal in a classy but comfortable atmosphere...I say yay.For a short recap: this place serves good Mex as far as London goes, has a creative street-food menu approach great for sharing if you don't \u00a0like fish tacos. Salsa is smokey and spicy, and if you ask them for more chips they'll give 'em to ya. Fun atmosphere and reasonable, even for broke students. Oh, and get the rice-milk Horacha drink if you can't splurge on the margaritas, like me!",

It's also very colourful and friendly compared to the superclean, sharp and pointy aesthetic of the Wharf. The food is nigh on identical between all the Wahaca sites, and their quality control is perfect. All the staff did a brilliant job too; friendly and present when you need them. The trick to a good Wahaca experience, as I've said before, is to be adventurous with your order. My favourites are the black bean soup, pork scratchings with guacamole and fish tacos. The tequila is also excellent and a far cry from the pungent student nightmare that puts most of us off it for life. Give it a go. Order big. Share everything. Good times.",

The restaurant itself is really nice, on the second floor overlooking the park in Canary Wharf with the Skyscrapers in the background. The interior also is lovely with its open, comfortable, wooden and stylishly lit indoor. The food is also great; I recommend getting a few small dishes and eating it like Tapas...that way you will get a bit of everything and feel satisfied with the various and different flavours and experiences of each street dish. I have to say the mains do not seem to live up to the small dishes with the Burrito, the flagship dish of any Mexican restaurant, dry and clearly not prepared fresh and from scratch Also the vegetarian options seem to be basically nil. Only a salad there and a soup there...so don't go there with a veggie! Otherwise it remains my favourite Mexican restaurant franchise and is a nice, unpretentious and cheery place to eat in Canary Wharf.",

The Tortilla soup was amazing with big pieces \u00a0of avocado, but the high point of the evening may have been the chisels with a cup of melted chocolate for dipping! a real must do if you're in Limehouse or Canary Wharf.",

If you are looking for a place to go to with colleagues that is convenient, trendy and causal I highly recommend coming here. Also, you can't beat the location of this place as it's centrally located near all the major offices and rail station.",

Our server didnt start to be particular friendly and hard to wave down, but by the time we finished dinner and were sitting around chatting, a server came by tossed some churros in our way, and continued walking. We were trying to wave him down but he didnt even bother with us and no one was in sight. We thought maybe it's on the house and ate it. 10 minutes later, our server came by and asked us if we ordered the churros and we said no but we couldnt find anyone so we thought it was on the house (some places actually have services and do that) and she began to LECTURE us in a very rude tone about how we shouldn't eat food that we didnt order,and then proceeded to put it on our bill, causing the another set of churros to come by and dropped off our table. We waved someone down to ask them what's going on, and then the server came again and lectured us AGAIN about how we ate the first churros (that we ended up paying for), while taking the new set away (despite it was actually made for us this time). Wahaca really needs to clean up their staff. Her name is Alice, btw, and her english was not very good.",

Unfortunately this hurt our experience here a bit, though.Due to rush hour, the waiter stopped by about 3 times saying he will attend to us. The second time he actually started taking our order and then bolted off half way through my order because he forgot to attend to another table first! Mate! Additionally, half way through my meal I realized my british steak burrito was cooked blue! The cow of which this fine piece of meat came from was pretty much still alive. Absolutely disgusting. I complained showing the manager it was barely simmered and he agreed and immediately took it off the bill, so props for customer service in that regard but I was still dissapointed I couldn't finish my burrito. Living in California, I have to say Wahaca is not at all authentic but I don't care because the rest of our food was delicious and it really does seem like a great place to come. Unlucky about our rude-ish waiter and poorly cooked steak but I'm willing to give Wahaca a second chance given the rest of the food and every other part of the experience was pretty good.",

I won't be going back to the Southbank one anytime soon but I may just try to eat at another Wahaca in the near future.The view of Canada square is really great and you can open the windows fully which was great as we went on a hot summers day.There's always events happening in Canada Square so if you are there and fancy a break whilst maintaining a good view of what's going on then this is the bar that you should go to.",

The black been quesadillas are also very good, as well as the tacos. For lunch I have ordered sometimes the salads and wasn't disappointed at all,also because it comes in \u00a0crispy bread bowl.My friends used to have burritos and they were always very satisfied with the food. I like the atmosphere here, so colourful and bright. As the food comes when it is ready, there are no long waiting periods and the service is very fast.

Whilst I would say the food itself is pretty average, I like that the staff are accommodating and it's a great place to host drinks looking over the green near One Canada Square. I recommend going in a group and sharing some small bites as well as ordering your own main. I usually go for the fish main which comes with rice and is zingy as well as being lighter than the larger taco bowl/burrito options. I've come here 5/6 times on different occasions and think it's usually a good choice for team lunch given everyone can order a main and just share some nachos and guac at the start.Drinks are reasonably priced and they have an unusual selection of tequilas etc. Food comes out as it's ready but it's a nice place for a date if you get a nice window seat rather than being sat by a big table.",

I started with an Hibiscus - I'm not a huge fan of tequila but when paired with cranberry juice it goes down a treat! Just yummy. Wahaca's is always a good, go-to staple when you need fast and reliable food! I ordered the grilled British steak tacos, the Smoky chipotle chicken quesadillas and Frijoles. The food literally came within minutes and I mean minutes! The steak was hot, cooked well - a little over done for my liking but for tacos it worked well! The quesadillas were a little bland but I ate them all the same. The stand outs for me were the beans and Chris' sweet potatoes chips - they were delicious! soft but crispy and seasoned well.Sure wahaca's isn't the best Mexican food you'll find in London but it's easy, reasonable priced - \u00a344 for 2 with 4 drinks, and the staff are friendly and helpful. We actually payed using flypay which made it even quicker to get in and out and off to the concert.",

    "text": "In the Canary Wharf/Docklands area there isn't a whole lot of choice for food outside your typical chain options. We ended up here for some food kind of by default -\u00a0it seemed like the best option from the few choices we had. Wahaca reminds me a lot of Topolabomba in Glasgow (Wahaca came first, just to make that clear). It's casual, open-area dining with table service and this location in particular was rammed with business folk who'd just knocked off work (or were still working on their laptops at their tables). The menu is your placemat and there's a pretty massive range so you should be able to find something that you like. We got guacamole and frijoles to share between the table - both of these were super tasty but as my workmate mentioned, the guac didn't look super fresh and had turned a little grey in colour. I ordered: chicken taquitos, salmon sashimi tostadas and crab & avocado toastadas. This was the perfect amount of food for a late night dinner and with most things coming in at around \u00a35, pretty damn good value too (esp for London). I can't decide which I liked the most as they were all pretty damn delicious -\u00a0I would say the chicken taquito needed some seasoning as it was perhaps a tad bland but otherwise I really liked the food. I also tried a passion fruit margarita which was way too sweet but once I watered it down it was fine. We had churros to finish - these are a small portion of 3 churros and the sauce is super rich. I could have done without these as then I'd eaten way too much food. My workmate paid for the meal on the app which is a kind of cool idea - although, you need to know your table number and we couldn't find this anywhere so had to ask a waitress. Service was excellent and friendly and all up, I was pretty impressed with this place for a late-night dinner.",

I usually go for the steak burrito, and can't find any fault with it - the steak is juicy and tender, and there is a lot of it. Burritos in other places are sometimes 95% rice but here there is a lot of other good stuff thrown in in good proportions - nice cabbage slaw, good rice, and nice cheese. Also comes with a few tortilla chips and salsa - nice extra! This all for under \u00a37 is an excellent deal for a dine in lunch or dinner. Also try sweet potato fries - to die for - and frijoles with chorizo (can be ordered with tortilla chips as a starter but if you order a burrito you get some chips anyway so can just order frijoles as a side because it's cheaper that way).",

I know they are a 'boutique' Mexican restaurant, \u00a0but they missed it. \u00a0The chips are commercial, \u00a0made in a factory and not meant to be fresh. If you want \u00a0salsa with your chips, it costs more, \u00a0same if you wish to add guacamole, \u00a0that is to say you have to order that order, meaning one order chips and salsa and a second order of chips and guacamole. The guacamole was good. The Black Bean and cheese quesadilla was bland, dry and comes without any crema or salsa. I did not finish. My server never came back around so I could not get some mild chilli sauce. \u00a0I guess I'll wait until I go to the states to get Mexican food.",

So, I could write this review from the point of \"disappointment\", but my expectations have been most definitely adjusted to fit what a London \"Mexican\" eatery will give me and what it will not.To be brief, I was not expecting outstanding service when I came here. And guess what? I didn't get outstanding service.I was not expecting to be bowled over by the greatest revolution in Mexican food since a man rode a little donkey across the border into California. And, you guessed it, the food was purely average representations of many dishes that we all know and (sometimes) love.The decor? The ambience? Ultra corporate. Ultra chain. No atmosphere. Apart from the clatter of dishes.So then. Just as I had thought. I was not expecting to be wowed and my expectations were met.",

It was a busy afternoon and we were told we'd be seated in a few minutes whilst we waited in the bar. The buzzer buzzed soon and we were on our way.We mostly ordered vegetarian options like plantain tacos, rice+beans, guac+nachos etc. I went for a chicken burrito and chicken quesadilla, in addition. We also had an almond/cinnamon/rice milk drink called horchata.The service was exceptional and so was the speed of service.Five stars again, cos simply they deserve it!As with any other place, I sincerely hope they continue to maintain their excellent standards.",
