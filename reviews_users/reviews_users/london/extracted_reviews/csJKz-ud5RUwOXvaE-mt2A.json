The service, especially front of house, is quite something else. We went with a group of friends having made a reservation for eight people at 8.30pm on a Saturday evening. We arrived at 8.35pm. The place was heaving and there was a party of four in the queue ahead of us who were given a suspiciously large table set for eight people (which was subsequently broken up to provide two tables for four people). Front of house staff then disappeared for a further 10 minutes. When we called for attention, a member of the front of house team arrived and was very off-hand. We stated that we had a reservation for 8.30pm and had been waiting a while already. We were told that the table had been given away because we were late by 15 minutes. Given that we had arrived at 8.35pm but not been acknowledged, and that the table had been given away within our sight at exactly that time - we sensed porky's being told. The member of staff in question was very belligerent, an experience quite outside my usual one when at this Tas branch (or any of the others for that matter). I can only assume we got them on a bad day. It was disappointing. We walked over to Ev instead (also owned by the Tas group - but no Pide) and had a nice meal there. It was sad to see an otherwise excellent restaurant, which displays extraordinarily high standards for it's medium price range, be so let down by such poor service.",

We went a bit later so I think most of the theatre goers had left and it was a little bit quieter than I would have expected but there was a band in the corner which made up for it. There is a wide variety of choice, both vegetarian and meat, which is especially good for me and my boyfriend who are vegetarians. We both went for a pide and found they were a little bland but it was nice to try something different. My parents went for meatier options and both enjoyed their food. The baklava was delicious, and the Turkish coffee pleasantly strong. The main drawback for us was the slow service, and it wasn't even very busy. My dad had to order his beer twice before he received it. They weren't short-staffed as there were a lot of waiters standing around. Overall, a pleasant evening, and good value. I would recommend this place to vegetarians especially just for the wide variety of options that they offer. (Sometimes difficult to find when going for a not-specifically veggie restaurant, with meat-eaters!)",

I ordered the Sahan set meal for 9.45, which was well worth it - a feta salad and a pide, which is kind of like a Turkish pizza, I guess. You can also get a more calzone-like version.The feta salad: I was not expecting much, but it was actually rather incredible. A dressing of balsamic glaze and lemon with mint and dill made it outstanding. The pide: minced lamb and red pepper, perfectly spiced, in a baked? fried? crusty thing. It really hit the spot.My friend had some delicious dolma and a different pide, with lamb and cheese. There are a number of vegetarian options, but gluten-free might be a problem.The desserts looked delicious but we were too full from the pide!I'm deducting one point for waiter service. I wondered if we were actually in the Anatolian deserts as I could not get a glass of water for the life of me even when my friend received her drink; finally asked a different waiter and still took him five minutes. Still a great restaurant for food and atmosphere.",

Right by the theatre, looked quite busy but I had about 1 hr 15 mins so perfect to grab food before the performance.Lovely waiters, menu looked AMAZING and I wanted to sit there for about 6 hours and slowly eat all of it.. Before exploding from gluttony of course! But I restrained myself (casual pat on the back there, thank you very much) and ordered small. Nothing worse than feeling too full at a theatre performance, totally takes away from concentration. Now despite me ordering small, I received my food 15 minutes before the performance was due to start. That's about 45 minutes of waiting after I ordered. For not very much, mainly cold food. Super disappointing.I however will go back; the food was AMAZING. So tasty, shame I had to shovel it into my already big mouth and run.",

Unlike most London Italian pizza there is not much emphasis on the cheese and tomato base. Instead, they are lighter, spiced and herbed - with a variety of toppings. The set menus are really good value here. There are a couple of mezze, a vegetarian option and another which includes a starter and pide.The service is attentive and quick. The d\u00e9cor is inspired by traditional Turkish restaurants, with lots of richly woven fabrics.All the food I have had here has been good. I would particularly recommend the calamari, borek as well as all the pide dishes. Additionally, it is worth leaving room for desert. There are a few that look good, but the one that I usually go for is the sundried apricots stuffed with pistachio and cream. It may sound a little underwhelming but it is delicious and works perfectly with a cup of Turkish coffee as an end to your meal.",

I also tried the red lentil soup which was also very good.The restaurant was quite busy on the Saturday night, which I guess should be expected with it being so close to the Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe Theater, so make a reservation if you can.Prices are cheap for the quality of food you get.",

Some of the meat and seafood dishes sounded good though, so maybe I should go back and try those.Oh, and one plus is that they serve complimentary bread and soup that were pretty good.

I had the Globe Menu which allowed me to choose several dishes and a drink for only 20 pounds and was a great introduction and way to try several types of Turkish food.It was definitely a crowded spot, but everything was very clean; the service was prompt and attentive (we were a walk-in with no reservation and had very little wait); the food was amazing; and there was live music playing that was lovely. A definite recommendation for dinner before your Shakespeare Globe Theater play and delicious food!",

Toilets were impressive with stone and nice floor tiles. You don't see such attention to bathroom detail in the States usually.  The chairs were a bit on the lowside.

Since the restaurant was known for its Pides, we both ordered the set menu of a pide and a soup. The lentil soup was very delicious and the pide was light but filling. Neither of us could finish our pides (one was the ground lamb with an egg on top and the other was the leek with cheese) and took them to go. Throughout the night, service was excellent, and the overall bill for two set menus and two glasses of wine was 40 pounds which was fine given the crazy prices in the city.We would definitely come back if not for anything but the warm and kind service we received.",

    "text": "I guess Jamie W. and I landed on yet another chain in London. So much for being penny-pinching food snobs when we travel, but we ended up at Tas Pide because there was a dearth of lunchtime dining options around the Tate Modern, and Turkish food sounded pretty good since we were eating a lot of Italian during our London stopover. The decor did remind me a bit of Istanbul by way of HGTV with lots of rustic wood beams, cane-backed chairs and things you would have bargained to pilfer at the Grand Bazaar (photo: bit.ly/1imHxV7). At 2PM, the place was near-empty except for a group of young Eastern European women in heavy make-up and nearly-invisible shorts.I'm not presuming what they did for a living, but they did seem to text a lot. Ahem. Anyway, things looked bright right away as the young waiter brought us a basket of warm Turkish bread, a ramekin of hummus and another ramekin of marinated olives (photo: bit.ly/Rvlbta). They were still offering their \u00a3 9.45 three-course lunch menu, so we took advantage (photo: bit.ly/1oCNyBY). I started with the Humus Kavurma which featured diced lamb, pine kernels and paprika (photo: bit.ly/1imHnwP). It was a bit oily but good, just what we wanted at that time of day. I just wish they provided pita wedges so we could scoop up more of it. Since I had not eaten a Turkish pizza in such a long time, I tried the Kiymali Pide, which was apparently one of their house specials.Quite doughy, it was shaped in the traditional eyelid shape with minced lamb (are you sensing a pattern here?), fresh tomatoes, onion, parsley, red pepper and a scrambled egg stuffed inside (photo: bit.ly/1imHoRw). While it sounded tasty, it was rather dry for all the effort, so i used the pickled red cabbage to lubricate it as much as I could. I guess I was expecting more of a kick given the plethora of ingredients. The meal ended with their only dessert option, the Kaymakli Kayisi, sauteed apricots in a house-made cream with chopped almonds and pistachios (photo: bit.ly/1jUHVOO). It was a bland little concoction hardly worth calling a course, but at least it gave us something sweet before our short walk back to our hotel. What we really needed was some Turkish delight.FOOD - 3 stars...pretty good Turkish fare though some shortcomings were evidentAMBIANCE - 4 stars...the decor felt right even if the chairs were a bit uncomfortableSERVICE - 3.5 stars...very quiet and attentive even with the lure of Eastern European, ummm...entrepreneursTOTAL - 3 stars...not quite a Turkish delight but if you need a hummus fix, here it is..",

There were too much parsley added before serving which dominated the taste. The Turkish pastrami was over cooked. I don't know the other dishes but based on this experience it is hard to recommend the pides.",

A lot of green plants adorning the walls and windowsills. The furniture was carefully chosen and placed across the big space occupied by the restaurant. They also have a little terrace ornamented with flowers and more plants for the summer days.We came quite early so we almost had the place to ourselves and service, if not warm, was quite swift. Our waitress seemed a little impatient when we seemed to take our time to carefully read all the menu (which is quite large) but oh well, it was a good day and I decided not to mind. Upon arrival, we were served warm homemade (I guess) bread with olives and a creamy dip. It was a good start worth mentioning because both the bread and the dip tasted amazing. I didn't try the olives. For drinks they offer a big enough selection of wines and I had a nice Chenin Blanc (white wine). For food I decided on the \u00a312 something menu which allows a starter and a pide, their specialty I guess? It's ab eyed shaped dough bowl filled with whatever you chose.  The hummus was the best I've had in a while. I'm a very big fan of hummus and I was very happy. It was also served in a generous quantity. Then I had the minced lamb pide. It was good, the bread was warm and homemade in their traditional pit oven, and I do appreciate when a dish is appropriately seasoned. A very good experience in a nice environment !",

Also the vegetables had no taste of their own, the sauce was nice that came with it though. This came with a side of Turkish bread which was stale and didn't taste nice at all. The Pide was absolutely wonderful. We had one with feta and leek, and it was really nice. We then had one more main dish each, the moussaka and one grilled vegetables with potatoes, something \"patatas\". They were both bland and not tasty at all.

    "text": "The best available option near the Globe in my opinion. Nice decor. Wide menu. Good wine list and fair prices. We had Icli Kofte (lamb meatballs) and Ahtapoc Salatasi (octopus salad) and were ok but not great. Kusbasili Pidi (baked lamb) was good. Sondali Dana Kaburna (steak and vegetables) came without rice so we ordered a side of pilaf. Attention was top notch. Anatolia red wine was good. I give this place a 5 star rate because is the best option in that touristic area.",

    "text": "I may have made bad choices but I found my food a bit bland (dolma and a vegetarian pide with aubergine/tomato on it) though not unpleasant. There were some nice olives on the table. The nice waiter talked me into getting chocolate cake which was also nice - like a Sara Lee chocolate gateaux but nicer. All ok/nice.Minor downsides were that it is a bit of a squeeze - we were a group on a long thin table against the wall in the corner and if someone on the corner side needed to get out, the whole row of us had to completely leave the table! They were also pretty slow with tap water (an essential for me - water is genuinely my favourite drink and I don't see why I should pay for bottles of it when I like tap fine).This all said, I had a great time - the food was only ok for me, a couple of tiny annoyances - BUT this place has a lovely warm friendly feel, nice lighting/noise level/cosy decor so it was great for the group of us to laugh and chat and feel good and take our time.",

A great atmosphere for friends catching up or an informal dateAs for the food, order everything you can. The selection is incredible and the quality of the food itself is mouthwatering. I went with both veggies and meat eaters and everyone left happy and feeling like we were rolling down the street. I would happily order food, wine and sit here for a full 5 hours and enjoy my surroundings.",
