GO for it.5) banana fritters - CRISP - ordered this based on the reviews... the ice cream was delcious, and the batter was VERY crisp, but what did not do it for me was the mushiness and the blandness of the banana... it tasted floury... which is a pity... as i don't think this one will be a repeat (for me).6) grass jelly juice - YUM - i am sure it doesn't float everyone's boat, but i LOVE this, sweet and gelatinous was quite refreshing. \"i\" am a fan7) sprite... umm.... yep... standardall this for \u00a345 (with tip).

    "text": "Tukdin Flavours of Malaysia - Pics at The London Foodie (thelondonfoodie.co.uk/20\u2026 ) I am enjoying the 2010 Malaysian Kitchen Campaign a great deal. The opportunity to find out more about one of the most fascinating but relatively undiscovered Asian cuisines (and eat a lot of it in the process), right here in London, is an opportunity not to be missed. I was lucky enough to have been involved in this campaign for the launch of the Malaysian Dining Card at Kiasu (reviewed here), and more recently as part of a Malaysian restaurant tour which included Awana, Satay House and Tukdin. The event was organised to showcase what these restaurants will be offering at the Malaysian Section of this year's Taste of London Festival. Our final destination was at Tukdin, a charming little restaurant on Craven Road, Bayswater. The restaurant felt very Malay (as opposed to Hokkien-Chinese or Indian); the clientele appeared to be native, and wonderful smells of spices, coconut milk and grilled fish were wafting through the air as I came in. It was nice to see entire Malay families eating together, and I could sense a delightful camaraderie among most customers who were probably regulars and clearly knew each other. Malaysia has three main ethnic groups \u00a0the Malays, Chinese and Indians. Since the Malays are predominantly Muslim, there was no alcohol or pork on the menu, and all the meat served was halal. To kick off proceedings we had Satay Goreng (chicken served with peanut sauce) served off the skewer. The meat was sweet and had a delicious char-grilled flavour, and in my opinion, was the best Satay of the evening. Mee Goreng Mamak (vegetarian fried noodles) was served next. The soft yellow noodles had a lovely richness, and a slight sweetness from the kicap manis (Malaysian sweet soy sauce). The noodles were stir-fried with chunky pieces of firm tofu and rice cakes and topped with ground peanuts and spring onions. One of the best dishes was the Ikan Rasa Khas (sweet and sour sea bass). The fish had been cut up in chunky fillets, deep fried and topped with a delicious sweet and sour sauce made from tamarind and chillies. I also enjoyed the Daging Salai Masak Lemak Cili Api (grilled beef in coconut sauce with lemongrass, turmeric and chilli). The combination of the creamy, sweet coconut milk with the tart lemongrass went particularly well with the grilled beef. To accompany these main dishes, we had coconut and corn rice and Tukdin's special mixed vegetables pickle called Acar rampai. The Kupang Berlada (mussels in chilli sauce with lime leaves) was also excellent. I could taste a rich mix of flavours including pineapple, coconut milk and lime and with a touch of heat from the chillies. This was again a very good dish. I enjoyed all three restaurants but felt that Tukdin was particularly special - the food was fantastic and great value, and I cannot wait to return. I would also like to revisit Awana for a more considered opinion. I strongly recommend trying some of these restaurants' dishes available at Taste of Malaysia if you are planning a visit to Taste of London Festival this year (17 -20 June) in Regent's Park.",

    "text": "Tukdin's menu isn't huge (like, er, no roti?) but what they do I dare say they do well. They only have three starters for example, the satay goreng (which was still as fabulous this time around), sup asam manis (prawn and squid sour soup) and karipap (chicken or potato pasties). And with the exception of the yellow-ish beef curry, which tasted more like a Thai green curry (no rendang!), all the mains were To. Die. For. especially the rasa khas, a large slice of deep fried sea bass in Tukdin's special sweet and sour sauce big big heart Everything was appropriately spicy, the sambal udang (prawns) carrying a delightful kick and the kangkung belachan, that one made my nose run and so it absolutely should! To challenge their limited starters menu, Tukdin offers all of two \u00a0that's right, count with me now: one. two. \u00a0desserts. Bubur pulut hitam (black glutinous rice with coconut milk) and pisang goreng (banana fritters). The pulut hitam came with a large dollop of vanilla ice cream which would seem rather generous to ye olde regular bystander but here's the thing: this dessert is never served with ice cream! Totally veering left of tradition here but hey, it worked. And it worked a treat. And the banana fritters? I think the 'nanas were a little unripe but hey, that's not their fault. Overall, I LOVED Tukdin and will be back!",

Unfortunately, there were some problems with the order and they missed off one of mains we have ordered (it happened to be mine). It was disappointing they didn't bother telling us until I asked about the missing dish, but I can only guess they aren't used to dealing with such a large volume of order for one party at once.",

    "text": "That's what I love about balmy summer nights in London. It encourages one to get out and walk round our great city. It was on one such random excursion this weekend that I stumbled upon Tukdin.It's located just far away enough from the tourist trap centre around Paddington station to need to serve good food in order to survive.I discovered from my server, who happened to be the daughter of Tukdin that the restaurant was started and is named after her dad. Unusually for a Malaysian restaurant in London, it's owned and run by Malays, which is reflected in the halal sign on the door and a sign stating different opening times during the current month of Ramadan when Muslims fast during daylight hours.This ownership is translated onto the menu, which leans more towards Malay food and of course there's no pork on the menu.It was nice to see traditional drinks like rose syrup and teh tarik on the menu. I however settled on a lychee juice which came with 3 plump lychees in it.I started with curry puffs, 2 parcels of chicken curry wrapped in a lovely light flaky pastry. The crimped edges bring memories of Cornish pasty but it's much smaller in size and the pastry is much lighter and flakier.I then set the kitchen a stern test - fried koay teow (broad rice stick noodles). It is my favourite hawker (street) food dish and I've even stated in public that I just may have to marry a girl if I find out she can cook decent fried koay teow. The perfect version is bursting with heady aroma of garlic and the slightly chared edges of the rice sticks and every mouthful is a taste of savoury heaven.I've tried to reproduce this dish at home, using tips as diverse as adding a stock cube to sourcing the freshest koay teow straight from the factory but it doesn't come close to the best versions. Perhaps my domestic hob just can't generate the fiery temperatures required to get that proper fried taste into the noodles.I'm glad to report that the fried koay teow was good. Not the best in London but it's up there for sure.The only slight disappointment for me was the chicken curry, which lacked the true depth associated with the best chicken curries.There was a healthy number of Malaysian accents in the restaurant. I willo certainly dine here again when I'm on the area.",

    "text": "Well, it would be criminal if this Singaporean turned American turned Brit mutt didn't go to a Malaysian restaurant 15 minutes walk from his flat. This is why statistics requires you to have a sample size of 15 (for a student - t distribution) or 30 for a normal distribution. 3.5 stars is about as wrong for this place as Obama refusing to bow to the Queen. Been here three times since moving and I have to say, it's the best Malaysian food west of Old Street (only because I've heard Sedap is just as good, but who the heck from West London would travel out that way just to eat?!). \u00a0The only other place \u00a0that probably is more authentic, but you'll either have to look Malaysian or speak Malaysian or be accompanied by one, is the Malaysia House - i.e. embassy. Food here is delicious, authentic and served with just about the nicest people on the planet (faux pas and inappropriate alert: I think they're secretly mormon - j/k!). You HAVE to try the sambal belachan (additional chili-paste on the side). It will scrape paint off the side of a car, but with every possible authentic taste that Malaysia could ship over in an aircraft. Anyway, anything you order here is good (at least in the case of most of the dishes I've tried), but beware, it does get a little on the pricey side because of it's location. Serving sizes are caught somewhere between British and American, which also means a decent meal for how much you pay.I'd also recommend not coming in groups of more than 10 (we did one time), \u00a0because I don't think their kitchen can really handle it, and some of the food came out tepid - but you can always get them to nuke it back to life. PS for the culturally uneducated and since I have written about alcohol at different joints - this place is run by muslim folk so forget the alcohol at home or pop over to the adjacent bars after if you need it.",

It's not a large restaurant - seats about 30 pax and I had no problem getting a seat for lunch on Sunday. But I have seen the place very busy even at 9pm on a Friday so it is popular. When I was there, most of the diners were Malaysian so clearly the food is authentic and the prices reasonable. And all this was true when I was there. I had nasi lemak Tukdin, oxtail soup, keropok and Ice Bandung - all Malaysian hawker staples / favourites. Food presentation was good and the food was tasty and authentic overall. The nasi lemak rice was particularly flavorful - full of coconut milk flavor, it had the right texture and basmati rice was used so the grains are drier and more discrete, giving a better mouthfeel. The keropok was crispy and tasted authentic, as did the ikan bills (fried anchovies) and fried chicken in the nasi lemak. The oxtail soup tasted exactly as it is in Malaysia with all the right spices and fried onions (which was FANTASTIC) and the meat was flavorful and 'fall off the bone' tender. \u00a0Service was friendly if a little slow, but I think there's only 1 wait staff for all the patrons so be patient. All in all, a very pleasant experience and I would recommend coming here for a very inexpensive and authentic experience of Malaysian food in London. For Malaysians, definitely a must!",

I haven't been home for 16 years and I have had my fair share of Char Kuey Teow in different Malaysian restaurant in US and UK and Tukdin was the best ! We ordered a spicy shrimp with petai ( oh my god , petai aka bitter bean. Love it and miss it ) and it came out just the way I remember having it in Malaysia. We also managed to order some Ox Tail soup and it had the same spices that I used to remember. I can't tell what it is but you will smell it when you are almost done with your soup. Service was good , our waiter was attentive and prompt. I don't live in London but if I do , this would be my new favorite Malaysian restaurant. The one thing I would probably mentioned is that the watercress seems to be a little old and it needed to be cooked just a little longer so that it's a little soft but yet still crispy. Other than that everything was perfect.If you would ask me to summarize Tukdin , I would say it reminds me of the food that my mom would have cooked for me when I'm home in Malaysia. Comfort food. Simple yet delicious. \u00a0Definitely do give it a try if you are ever in London.",

The rendang may have been cooking a while too long, with the beef much chewier than expected. The flavours, rich in coconut milk, lemongrass, and galangal, were spot on, if a bit oily.

    "text": "I've been here a few times and have tried their Mee Goreng (a classic Malaysian noodle dish). They can make the dish vegetarian which is great and they always check if eggs are okay which is great for vegans. I always find that their food is quite oily. If you get it to go - the bottom of the container is pooling with oil which is unpleasant. The service is quite dour and even if the restaurant is empty there is very little care and attention given to the clients. That's the main reason for my 3-star rating. I ordered an iced tea and was pretty annoyed to see the cashier mixing powdered tea and warm tap water together before serving it with a cube of ice. They charged me 3 pounds for a drink that wasn't even made in house and with little attempt to hide it. It's not a bad restaurant and in a pinch I would still drop by though I wouldn't bother with the drinks and would definitely get the food to go just to avoid the service.",

    "text": "Second visit here. The first was a few months ago and was blown away by the quality of the food that I had to come back to verify this wasn't a one off. Authentic cooking utilizing authentic spices makes you want to eat more than what you can accommodate! I went for the Mee Goreng with Garlic Chicken ( both comes separate). The noodles were succulent with a sweet tangy sauce which I could have not have enough off! The Garlic Chicken was deep fried giving a crispy outside but was moist on the inside with infused garlic. Where most deep fried chicken usually tasted like a lump of oil soaked meat, this was not the case.The restaurant was 95% full for most of the time I was there with most of the clientele being of Malay/Asian origins. Perhaps giving testament of a home cooked meal! My partner went for the Oxtail soup which although is listed as a starter you can get it as a main meal size portion. The feedback I had was that it was very tasty with a little spice to give it that 'zing'Service was polite and professional with the food delivered in an acceptable time. Not cheap here but not expensive. If you are driving, then parking will be a challenge during the week. More spaces on weekend after 1:30pm when the restrictions are relaxed.This will be my regular haunt going forward and would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "This place is like others say, real authentic.The curry puff, nasi lemak and other dishes were packed full of flavour and obviously cooked by Malay expats. The small downsides being that the nasi-lemak was a little stingy. Only less than 10 peanuts on the plate, 2 slices of cucumber. Now Malaysian Delights is a good example of what a real portion should be like. Food also came out quite quickly, given the fact we were the only people in the restaurant and the stoves were probably turned off.This aside, I loved every dish. The staff were extremely friendly and the perfect hosts Our group were the last customers before they closed and they asked us before starting to vacuum in case the noise disturbed us.I would most definitely take Malaysian friends here if they were feeling a little homesick.",
