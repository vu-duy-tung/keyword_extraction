    "text": "Barvarian style bierkeller in Borough. The name translates as caterwaul, appropriate for somewhere designed around low slung ceilings and loud, communal conversation. It was half full but still verging on too loud, not somewhere to take a date certainly, but the kind of place an office party could get their vocal chords limbered up before heading to a discotheque. The beer list is solid, lengthy, German and available in steins. The food list is perfunctory and pig flavoured. A number of different sausages come with (badly) fried chips, the other specials include Wiener Schnitzel, a plate size slice of pork, covered in breadcrumbs and forced into the fryer. Germany perversely manages more Michelin starred restaurants than any other European country other than the UK and France, but manages to have a universal reputation for bad, fried food. Katzenjammers offers a fun night, but won't change your mind about the cuisine.",

Beer selection is good (better selection of German beers than you can find in most other places!) if a little pricey.

I was initially distressed at the lack of cider, because I'm not a beer/lager drinker in general but they had a wide range of fruit beers suited to my sweet tastes and the one on tap was liked delicious slightly alcoholic Ribena. The food is hearty and reasonably prices - the sausage and chips option (you can choose 2 different sausages) is particularly good value for money and both the bratwurst and bockwurst were excellent. A fun place! (ps hot men here too)",

I am studying abroad at a University in London right now until December. One of the main reasons I came in the Fall was to make it to Oktoberfest at least one time in my life. I had a room booked with some friends(usually one of the hardest parts), but could NOT find a flight. I was devastated.Katzenjammers almost made up for it. Almost.My Frankfurter was nice a tasty with a great snap. My hacker pschorr liter was outstanding(if not expensive at 9 pounds) and the hot pretzels were great. I hear that some nights that have a true german band come and play some tunes. Wouldn't that be nice.Next time I get a pain in my heart that I didn't make it to Oktoberfest on my time abroad, I am going to head back to Katzenjammers.Prost!",

The pretzel I ordered as a main arrived as kind of dessert. So the timing was not perfect.

The bar is laid out with large benches and tables in a typical Bavarian style, and is attractively decorated. You can either order at the bar or have table service. The range of beers is a large and excellent selection from Germany. The bar staff wear traditional Bavarian dress, adding to the atmosphere. I've been several times since its opening about a month ago. On a Friday night visit, a brass band played pop music - sounds cheesy but does create an excellent atmosphere. I can recommend the food. Especially ordering a large pretzel with every drink (\u00a31.10). Also good are the sausage platters (served with lots of sauerkraut), cured meat selection. They do have at least one vegetarian dish. Overall a highly recommended bar with a great atmosphere. Would be particularly good if you booked a whole table for a large group or party.",

They have a superb lineup of German beers, with 7-8 on tap and dozens more in bottles, as well as a selection of German wines. The food is tasty and an incredible value. The freshly baked pretzels with a cold pint of wheat beer is a glorious treat.Katzenjammer's gets very busy on Thursday and Friday nights, but is usually not too crowded at other times. It's a great place to stop in for lunch on a rainy weekend day. We go often, and usually just order a sausage on a roll to go with our beers. The sausages (choice of 6 varieties) are really good, and come served on a generous roll slathered with sauerkraut and fried onions and a salad on the side. For \u00a35, it's hard to beat this meal. They also have some great dinner mains, including schnitzel, pig's knuckle, ham loin, and roast pork. These meals are hearty and huge. I especially love the spaetzle and, and the thin cut pomme frites are usually excellent. And whoever decided to deep-fry the dumplings that come with the pork knuckle is a genius. Skip the gulaschsuppe, though, as it is completely bland and more of a dry stew than a suppe. Food quality does vary somewhat from one visit to the next (and I wish they would take the time to wash the salad leaves, which are almost always full of grit). But service is usually quick and servings are generous for the price. The service is friendly, if sometimes a bit blas\u00e9, but the manager often makes rounds to tables to make sure patrons are happy. The place gets very noisy and boisterous when there are a few large groups, but it can also be enjoyably quiet. On weekend nights they have a brass/oompah band that is fun and actually avoids being too cheesy, but it does tend to make conversation impossible.",

But I just have a couple (minor) issues with this place: one, the acoustics--it's cavernous and a bit stark and so as the room fills, you and your friends will find yourself increasing in volume as the night goes on to be heard by one another. My second complaint is unfortunately staff-related: for some reason the girls seem to be required to dress in your typical white-frilly-low-cut-top and corset while the guys seem to have complete freedom in attire--or at the very least, their attire seems to be 'whatever tee-shirt isn't too wrinkled today.' I personally would like to see either all of the servers in German garb or none of them. Also, the same heaving girls don't seem to have been hired based on their knowledge of beer or given much in the way of training, as none of them were equipped to answer a single question I had (and none of my questions were crazy, like wanting to know the percentage of malt to hops or anything--it was more like 'So what IS this beer, exactly? Is it similar to an ale?'). (At least, the two I spoke two couldn't help; I can't speak for the rest.) I'll of course continue to return due to the fantastic beer selection, but it would be really nice to have this be a more professional bar given its potential.",

    "text": "On Wednesday, as part of our regular meet up myself and some friends went out for some food. The original plan was to go to Padella, however when my friends arrived there about 17:40 they found a rather large queue at the door (you cannot book at Padella) so diverted to Katzenjammer. Katzenjammer is a German style \"bierkeller\" and restaurant. It's located just next to Borough Market so great for either a quick drink or a nice sit, eat and drink.We grabbed a table near the bar (because that's the best place to sit, obviously) and started to peruse the menu. I was feeling particularly hungry so went for the sausage platter; selection of five sausages served on a bed of sauerkraut or red cabbage. I also got a side of fries for us all to nibble. My friends got the Jager Schnitzel (hunter style schnitzel with a dark mushroom sauce), sp\u00e4tzle (Bavarian pasta with cheese and onions) and a small sausage plate.I love this style of German food. It may be massively clich\u00e9d but it is so ridiculously tasty and satisfying when you're having beer. My food was delicious. I started to struggle towards the end but I persevered and defeated the plate. Each sausage was different and brought something new. I was a big fan of the thinner pfefferbeisser and paprikawurst. Denser, slightly chewier sausages which pack ridiculous amounts of flavour. I love cabbage and the sauerkraut and red cabbage accompaniments were excellent.Of course, I tried a little of my friends food too. The Jager Schnitzel was crispy and a little dry but the mushroom sauce saved it. The sp\u00e4tzle was nicely cooked but massively under seasoned for my taste (and for my friends. He spent most of the meal adding salt and pepper to it!) All in all the food was very good and I'd eat there again without hesitation.The other reason we were there was for beer! I tried 3 different beers before we left; Paulaner hefe-weissbier dunkel (dark wheat beer), Rosarda (Belgian rose beer made with summer berries) and Floris Apple (delicious Belgian fruit beer made with apples). All of these beers were excellent and that was barely scratching the surface of the selection of beers.Katzenjammers is highly recommended. Food, drink and location make it a real winner.",

It's in an old bomb shelter, so everything is a bit louder than normal making the noise level a little too high for me. I didn't enjoy the sausage I ate, but I think just chose poorly(had the pepper one) as everyone else raved about theirs. It was also really hard to get a drink at the bar- everyone pushed in and made it so you have to be super assertive to be noticed. Overall, a solid, fun time and I would return to see if the other things got better. Word of warning: the really large beer is insanely large.",

Whilst I cannot comment on the selection of German beer they had (I'm not an expert, and my guy friends ordered most of the drinks throughout the night), I can say that it was a neat experience overall. Beer was served in massive two-pint glasses (smaller options also available), and they had a number of German beers that I had not had before. The sausage platter we ordered hit the spot for us. Ambience was also fun. Located underground and filled with rows of wooden tables, it was very reminiscent of a Oktoberfest scenery. Equally, they had a second underground level, where an oompahband played. The band played a range of pop songs, adding to the festive atmosphere. Service was generally prompt as well. The waitresses were very diligent with taking the empty glasses and bringing back our orders. One downside was that the noise level was quite high. Do not go on a Friday evening if you intend to have a lot of conversations with your friends.",

    "text": "Had a fun night with a big group of people. We'd booked 4 tables and when we got there a couple of them were occupied. No real problem as they were marked with our name and time and the people there were happy to move - we told them that we wouldn't use them until more of our group turned up but when they did we'd need them. We were a little confused about ordering, whether it was at the table or at the bar. Several of us ordered at the bar, giving a central table number (we only knew one and this lead to a small problem) and bought some steins of beer. The beer comes in half pints, pints and steins - just under 2 pints. Unfortunately none of the special glasses offered by the Bavarian Beerhouse here.The food however is good, I ordered the Jager Schnitzel, or Hunters schnitzel. A large pork steak, pounded, breaded and fried, served with a mushroom sauce, fries and salad. It's a large portion and good value, the sauce being a little different than expected (I thought it would be creamy, don't know why) but adding some good flavour. There is German mustard on the table which isn't hot but has fantastic flavour. Food ended up being a little confused as people couldn't remember what they ordered, it all came to one table instead of going to the others etc. A couple of our people even ate meals that weren't theirs and were surprised when it came out later. Hint: if you ordered two of the same sausage and you grab the plate with two different ones, it's probably not your meal!Final orders was called about 10:15, quite early on, so once we'd finished our meal, a group of us headed over to Call Me Mr Lucky where we won a round of shots for the entire bar!",

But then about an hour and half in it seemed the staff either became more interested or there was a change of shift, because suddenly there was table service. Clientele were a bit of a turn off, for example two people would turn up at the table and ask to share it, as we had room for two more. Of course, we don't mind at all. The more the merrier. Then either two or at one point four more people would turn up after the first two. One group excelled at their task and were being extra annoying. Basically making you want to leave the table. Eh?? You're having a giraffe, darlin'! Stop swinging your ponytail off my head. Food was a lot better than expected. I went for the schnitzel and it was good. Final mention to the toilets, which were in a bit of a state, all sinks blocked or almost blocked. Ugh.I won't be rushing back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Came here one week after Oktoberfest in Munich to get over my nostalgia, after hearing from a friend that she'd had a wild night here. The only other German beer hall that I've been to in London is Bavarian Beerhouse at Old Street, and that was utter madness. Katzenjammers was an entirely different experience in this instance. When we arrived, there were only two other tables that were occupied at 5 pm on a Sunday evening, though it gradually filled, over half of them were just 1-3 people for a table that can seat 8 people comfortably, so still gave the room a half-empty vibe. But with 8 friends at a table, it just turned into a good catch up in a low key environment on Sunday evening. As for the food and drink, I'm not entirely sure of the prices, but I got a stein of Paulaner and my friend got a pint of a weissbier and that only came out to 14 pounds, which I thought was quite reasonable (I wasn't able to get my stein alone because they have a 10 pound credit card minimum, and it was surprisingly under that amount). I found it a bit odd that the only Oktoberfest beer available here was Paulaner, as they lacked any of the other big names (Erdinger, Lowenbrau, Hofbrau, etc.) We also later ordered schnitzel, currywurst, and kasseler, and that came out to about 9 pounds each for a full plate of food (with too much of the fries and salad to finish). I would have liked to see a haxe pork joint on the menu, but the food that we got was very good and satisfying.I think I prefer Bavarian Beerhouse but I am willing to give Katzenjammers another chance.",

He felt that a German Bierkeller was an appropriate venue for his last hurrahThe underground location made it a potentially sweltering venue on a hot July evening but there was a giant fan, which was helpfully directed at our table, so it wasn't too bad. The acoustics make it very loud and difficult to converse thoughMy dining companions were impressed by the range of German beer on offer and some decided to get into training for their visit to Oktoberfest later on in the year. I like the German theming with the staff dressing up in German costumes. There are also German music evenings held hereI opted for the schnitzel and a side order of spaetzle. The schnitzel here is made from pork and not the traditional veal. The good news was that it was large but could have done with a touch more seasoning in the batter. The spaetzle wasn't like mom makes it, according to Marcus and was basically pasta with cheeseThe food wasn't top class but I think that's more the fault of German food rather than the venue. Nevertheless, I had a fun eveningGood luck with the move, Marcus!",

    "text": "Katzenjammers (for ease I'm calling it KJ from now in) is one of the main Bavarian Bierkellers in London - the other being the Bavarian Beer House in Aldgate. They've taken the term \"beer cellar\" literally and stuck it under ground in an insulated, poorly ventilated, basement which boasts a thick miasma of sweat and other bodily fluids. It's not a good entrance but luckily everything looks up from there.They stock two well known Oktoberfest beers on tap - Paulaner and Hacker Pschorr. These are the ones every tent goes knows and perhaps loves and are characterised by a slightly sweet taste and a lightly carbonated body that makes for easy drinking. In keeping with the theme, beers can be obtained in pints or steins and it's a fairly easy guess at what most guys will order.KJ also offers up a range of standard Bavarian foods (think meat and potatoes in various forms) so it really could be a one stop place for your casual night out. If it wasn't for the oppressive humid atmosphere I'd be happy to stay down there, but when the weather is good take your stein and get up to street level.Prices are fairly reasonable but don't expect too many frills. And for you single guys (or maybe girls) out there, you can't help but appreciate the thought process that went into making the Drindl. If there is a more flattering waitress outfit, I'm yet to see it.",
