A little bit of MSG is fine but not when it gets to the point where you have to 'neck' a whole bottle of beer of soft drink. The only postive for me were the Mien Tay srping rolls which I have to say one of the best I've eaten anyway in the world but otherwise everything else was ok to good. I wished they would just use a little less MSG and everything food wise would be good. I'll stick to Song Que.",

    "text": "This restaurant became licenced in May so I was interested to see just how they were managing that so I went there last sunday to see. There is a sign on the door just saying \"We are now licenced\". It was not as full as previous Sundays and plenty of free tables. There was no wine list and no sign of any stocks of drinks. Inside it was obvious many were still bring their own drinks. A sign on the wall repeated that they were now licenced and had at the bottom in very small writing \"We encourage any alcohol but not soft drinks\". I felt comfortable with my wine bottle. When the bill came it was not itemised but was now split into two figures meals and drinks. The drinks showed \u00a35-10p. We had only ordered one carrot juice. I therefore would guess the juice was \u00a31-10 and there is a corkage charge of \u00a32 per person. Or perhaps the juice was \u00a32-10 and corkage of \u00a31-50 per person? Nothing on their web site or the menu so its a try it and see situation! Still lovely food though! Tony",

Not sure what that says about me...Makes for a seriously cheap night...we first ate here a couple of years ago when they first opened - we nearly had the place to ourselves then. Now it has expanded to the shop next door and the queues grow longer. Favourites - sea bass, soft shell crab, squid, clay pots - actually the menu here is just great. You need to visit often and work your way through it to make sure you do not miss any delights. This place serves seriously good food at ridiculously cheap prices.",

    "text": "I've decided that my love of pho makes it my responsibility to try it at as many places on Kingsland Road as possible. \u00a0I know what you're thinking - wow, she has some lofty goals - but I think this is a worthy cause. \u00a0 Mien Tay is the second place I've been on the \"mile of pho\" (Song Que was my first) and I was not disappointed. The space is a little cramped as most of the restaurant is taken up by large faux flower arrangements and no one was in a big hurry to take our order after we were seated. \u00a0I grazed on the prawn crackers that sat in a wicker basket shaped like a duck while I waited for service. \u00a0I was already on page 6 of the paper when I asked for the usual: fresh rolls (known as summer rolls in the States), a bowl of pho with sliced beef, and an iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. \u00a0There are only five pho options at Mien Tay: sliced beef, sliced beef & brisket, sliced beef & beef ball, beef ball and a mix of all four types of beef. \u00a0My husband was sad that tripe is not an option. \u00a0The fresh rolls were stuffed with lettuce, mint, pork and prawns and served with a sweet-ish dipping sauce. \u00a0The mixture was a bit too heavy on the lettuce and the flavour of prawns was lost in the shuffle. \u00a0The pho packed a deeply flavourful, meaty punch with lots of fresh herbs and hot peppers. \u00a0The soups were served with the requisite Thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, limes and hot peppers and, as usual, I spiced my bowl up until the broth took on a reddish hue. \u00a0Even though the service was a little spotty, we left with smiles on our faces.I noticed the hours aren't listed on Yelp, so I'll post them here. \u00a0Monday - Thursday: Noon - 3pm, 5pm - 11pmFriday - Saturday: Noon - 3pm, 5pm - 11:30pmSunday: Noon - 11pm",

    "text": "For full review see thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  We went to Mien Tay in Battersea on Friday night (they also have a branch in Kingsland Road in Shoreditch). It isn't really anything to look at from the outside, and inside with its bright lights and white paper tablecloths, is definitely cheap and cheerful. But there are also some treats \u00a0bottles of Saigon beer which made me nostalgic from a much-loved trip to Vietnam, super-posh thick wooden chopsticks, and coffee made the typical South East Asian way (with condensed milk \u00a0disgusting but reminded me with fondness of my trip). First things first, fresh rolls with shrimp and pork. Absolutely blummin' lovely especially with the thick satay dip. I could have eaten these all night. Then salt and pepper squid which sadly lacked a bit of flavour. For mains, we had a sizzling duck with black bean sauce which arrived bubbling with heat \u00a0it literally exploded all over our table, which thereafter resembled an oil slick. It was tasty, thick and meaty but didn't blow me away \u00a0we could perhaps have ordered something a bit more interesting (note: I realise this isnt a typically Vietnamese dish so woudl order differently next time). And, following a suggestion from Bibendum Wine on twitter, we had the steamed sea bass with ginger and chili. This was really gorgeous \u00a0a whole de-boned fish, delicately cooked and spiced, fresh and juicy, so it melted in the mouth. All in all, for 3 beers, 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 portions of rice, and 2 coffees, we paid around \u00a320 each and had a fun night. Recommended for a relaxed, tasty meal as long as you don't mind the lack of glitz and glam (although I imagine the karaoke tables downstairs would be fantastically glam). And next time I go, I'll make sure I choose some of the more unusual menu options.",

We sat upstairs and were faced with the touch decision of ordering from a long menu, where so many of the dishes sound so appetizing!Finally was able to come to a decision and went with the Chicken Clay Pot. BYOB so that definitely deserves a star on its own. The food was yum, service good, cheap, came to just over a tenner each for the 3 of us and were able to leisurely enjoy our meal at our own pace and were not rushed at all.Definitely recommend this for some authentic vietnamese nosh. I noticed on my walk to Shoreditch the variety of vietnamese restaurants in the area, but I was happy with my experience, so would skip the rest and go back to Mien Tay next time too!",

We began with vegetable spring rolls, which were interestingly latticed, crunchy but not greasy and served with fresh mint, crisp lettuce and clear, sweet/sour chilli dipping sauce. The other starter was beef with betel leaf, which had a surprising nettle-like taste, complemented by the crunch of crushed peanuts.For my main I tried the eel, fried with chilli and lemongrass. The eel was perfectly cooked - moist, succulent and gently flaky on the inside, crispy on the outside with a tang of lemongrass and crunches of garlic. I did get a bit of food envy watching a whole seabass with mango strips arrive at another table. Must go back.",

    "text": "As with Lizzie, this would have been a five, and I dearly wanted it to be, but the venue was a let down, just for the sheer uninspiring nature and size of it.They quite nicely did what they could to accomodate the size of our party, but it was clear that it was not something they encountered often. Thankfully, they added one more table at the end, and we were just about able to all fit around without blocking off the remaining space.The menu was sizeable, with so many different categories, let alone ingredients, that it was hard to pick something. After Lizzie and I came to the agreement of sharing some rice, and both having our own little meaty dish with it, I ended up with some sweet and sour chicken. Never having had vietnamese before, playing safe with such a sizeable group seemed the best thing to do.And wow, never before has playing safe been so rewarding. The sauce was perfect, as was the meat. The only thing that could have made the selection any better, was more of it - even then, that's purely out of greed, not a problem with the portion! In fact, my dish, combined with half a frogs leg and a piece or two of Lizzie's chicken, with half a dish of rice, was the perfect size meal for me to be full but still comfortable. It's almost as though they'd knocked me out, opened me up and measured my stomache before hand! Just perfect!I would actually be willing to travel all the way back here, just for this, if I was going to get the company even half as good as the full Yelp group we had.For a wonderfully low price, I offer it high recommendations. Just try to keep the party size down a bit, and remember to bring some alcohol (from the off license 4 doors down, if need be).",

I didn't care where I got it from, I just knew that I had to have it, or else there would be hell to pay. Thank goodness then that I somehow found myself on Kingsland Road, spying up the mighty Mien Tay. Whilst there are other (dare I say it) slightly fancier looking Vietnamese eateries situated in Shoreditch, I would seriously doubt that there are many that serve up such tasty and terrifyingly cheap fare. To say that Mien Tay is cheap would be an understatement. My lunch of fresh, cool and delicious Summer Rolls (bursting at the seams with basil and prawns), a magnificently delicious, authentic (and huge) bowl of delicately spiced Pho, a large Tiger Beer and a Vietnamese iced coffee only came to \u00a312. When you take into consideration that a lot of starters in London restaurants are priced at \u00a312, this is scandalously good value. Best of all, Mien Tay doesn't skimp on portions either - by the time I left here I practically had to be rolled out through the door. With all this, AND a 'Bring Your Own Booze' alcohol policy, Mien Tay is undeniably a rare gem of the London restaurant scene. If you live in London and haven't been yet, go. Go now!",

Therefore, I requested a Martini ... and then another one.My pilgrimage to Mien Tay was long. It was late by the time I got there, and I was so hungry that I was unable to process information from a menu of some 200 items. Clueless, I asked a smiley waitress to brainstorm with me, and we narrowed things down to two starters, instead of one main dish.

Nevertheless, it took forever to serve us and they were really unfriendly; they just did not seem to want to be there at all. But anyways, it's not the service that matters, it's the food! The food was not very good. The fresh rolls were boring and without much in it, except for noodles. The Rice Vermicelli with pork and a spring roll was SO bland! The fish/garlic sauce which you would normally pour over everything was very artificial- almost like a sweet and sour sauce- so I didn't even use it.",

    "text": "Anybody who knows me knows I'm the ultimate carnivore when it comes to seafood. Maybe it's to make up for the fact that I don't eat land-meat, but I get just as excited about a vast array of fruits de la mer as most people get about a juicy steak. Maybe it's because when I was six I wanted to be Ariel from The Little Mermaid. After all, I do love seaweed. Yelping has helped expand my repertoire and I'm much more experimental these days - I'll consume squid and swordfish, octopus and lobster with aplomb.But I'd never met a deep fried soft shell crab until the day the marvellous Lizzie G introduced myself and several other yelpers to the joy that was Mien Tay. She promised me I'd forsake the love of a good man for one of these little critters. Now, if you've never had soft shell crab, don't be alarmed, but you're basically popping the entire thing in your mouth. Does what it says on the tin really, soft shell equals edible, and these are bitesize tiny creatures with a crispy coating and tender, melt-in-the-mouth meat inside. Even some of the carnivores were somewhat put off by the fact that you were eating its whole li'l bod, but me? Pah. All that stuff about crustaceans screaming when you cook them is just a rumour. Either that or they've just found out I've entered the room.Oh, and the forsaking? Well, I doubt I'd be the first to say I'd happily leave a man because of crabs. (Buh-dum, tssh!)As for the rest of the food on offer, my word, it's just incredible. We ordered a veritable buffet of treats including an entire deep-fried sea bass (and believe me, that bass was bliss - fish flaked straight off the bone, no annoying pulling bits out from your teeth or anything), various tofu dishes, gigantic prawns with cashew nuts, noodles, rice... the list goes on. Even the basics like the prawn crackers are mouthwatering, and it's BYOB, so everything winds up being a zillion times cheaper than you'd think. My advice is take a pro with you and get them to order a bunch of recommended plates, otherwise you might find yourself in procrastination central with that behemoth of a menu! I agree with the other yelpers that the venue's a bit cramped and difficult to navigate but the food is the star of the show here.Lush. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I miss Vietnamese food. It was a staple lunch for me for a good couple of years and suddenly, it's gone. Poof. Just like that. So far, I believe there is only one pho stop in Edinburgh, and it's not within walking distance for me either for lunch or for dinner. I knew London would be different. Turns out Kingsland Road is the place to go when you are craving a vermicelli bowl (like me) or pho (not like me). So I made the trek (literally, as half the tube network was down for maintenance on Saturday) to finally appease my cravings, unsated for 6 MONTHS. This was going to have to be good. So, down to it. First of all, stars a-plenty for the appetiser - summer rolls (aka fresh spring rolls) stuffed with prawn. No pork! Which means I got to tuck into something I hadn't had in a long time. Oh the combination of shellfish, fresh coriander and mint, vermicelli all dunked in peanut satay sauce is just divine. Next up - my all-time-fave, vermicelli and veggie spring rolls. Now, it was pretty good, but the spring rolls tasted suspiciously meaty (on inspection couldn't find any trace), and the sauce was a sweet chilli base - got to admit, I like my fish sauce unadorned with sweet chilli, so it wasn't the most ideal for me. Overall though, good portions and I was stuffed to the core. My waiter kept disappearing so it did get a little confusing for me to figure out what was going on at times and left before presenting me with a bill. So really, what am I saying? Mien Tay is good, that is for sure, but I think I would want to try other places along the K-Road (as I now call it) prior to tipping my hat at it.",

    "text": "First of all, a massive thank you to all you wonderful Yelpers who recommended this place to me, you certainly know your stuff!!I was meeting up with some friend that I had originally met while travelling in Vietnam and was looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant to relive these memories. Mien Tay is pretty much as close as you are going to get in this country (the only thing missing was the force-feeding of the spring rolls, may be if we had asked...)They have a huge menu which included the usual pho and noodle dishes as well as some more unusual seafood dishes. We went for the salt and pepper squid and vegetable spring rolls to start. The spring rolls seemed particularly authentic, using the Vietnamese wrappers as opposed to the normal Chinese ones you tend to find in this country. They were tasty and not too greasy which is always good, and served with some amazing pickled veg. For main course I went for scallops with ginger and spring onion, the scallops cooked to perfection and not at all chewy - top marks here. The rest of the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals and were very impressed with my restaurant choice (thanks again Yelpers!)The restaurant is BYOB so this keeps the costs down and I thought the whole thing was very good value for money. I was surprised at how busy the restaurant was - we got there before 7 and took the last table, by the time we left people were waiting for to be seated in the cafe next door. I would recommend booking in future.The only things stopping this place from getting the full five stars are the fact that the staff can be a little surly and the dining room isn't anything to write home about. C\u00e1m on Mien Tay for a great Vietnamese dining experience.",

Take your hands off that last deep fried soft shell crab or i may have to bite you......Yip folks, they really are that good.Having gone on a bit of a 'posh nosh' tour of London, it was nice to fire into a proper wee restaurant that was more substance than style.To say the food in here was authentic would be as similarly stupid a statement as pointing out that the Pope was indeed a catholic, or that bears do in fact....lets just stop there.So, the scoop? Well, a big whack of us entered this wee joint and ordered a big spread of grub for sharing and general table leaning, plate passing fun activities.Yum says I. As a bit of a shellfish-a-phobic (its a real word!) i was a tad dubious about the crab, but can honestly say they were just flippin lovely.Everything else was similarly flantastic, as was the service offered throughout.things to look out for!- BYOB, grab some at a local takeaway a'fore entering- comical urinal in shower box......yes, that's what i said.All in all an amazing spot to grab some real down to earth grub at very reasonable prices....spot on!!",

Situated in 'Little Hanoi' on Kingsland road, there is nothing remarkable about it form the outside. Upon entering, the lovely, lovely waiting staff seat you whether you are waiting for a table or for take-away. All smiles and consideration, they bring you a generous portion of prawn crackers. Perusing through the bamboo covered, sensibly laminated, menu is a joy and a chore. Joyous because the food all sounds wonderful and a chore because narrowing it down sometimes proves impossible! Once you have managed to reduce the items to a shortlist (I'd recommend the grilled beef with lemongrass) the price is very reasonable at around \u00a35 for a main with \u00a32 or so for rice, depending on your choice. A 'Bring your own Booze' policy also keeps costs down. All fresh, good quality ingredients, fantastic flavours, authentic, friendly atmosphere and very reasonably priced - you can see why this is one of my favourite places to eat!",

But once you get your food, you immediately forget about everything! The food is absolutely fantastic! The portions are massive (also the starters), and considering the crowd, we didn't have to wait very long. I take one star for the service. Mine and my boyfriend's starters arrived about 10 minutes apart. They didn't bring the drinks we ordered and when we asked for them they said they lost the order and they don't know what to bring. The service was a bit chaotic, but that's probably what happens when you have 5 different people serve the same table. The nice thing is that you can bring your own bottle of wine. And don't forget to book a table, otherwise you'll have to queue for 40 minutes to get one.",

Despite being half empty it still took quite a while for the staff to get our order and for the food to arrive. Nothing too bad...... except...... it sucks to wait when your table is in close proximity to a door that leads straight to the street. It was a particularly cold evening so every time someone opened the door you would get the occasional glacier breeze. The place feels like a family business that hasn't change since the seventies (and there's nothing wring with that). There's always this background music that could be taken out of a half empty shopping mall - think Hotel California, the polyphonic version.Ambiance covered, onto food!The spring rolls were nice and so was the pork with egg and rice, but what really shined was the pancakes. OMG. Call off the search for delicious food, your prodigal son has returned! It's the kind of stuff you wish someone had introduced in your life when you were 10 years old. Try them and you will know exactly what I mean.So all in all, it's not the most amazing place in the world but it's not bad either.

It specialises in cuisine from South Vietnam and serves a wonderful array of dishes including the amazing Char Grilled Quail with Honey, Garlic & Spices and the Prawn and Green Papaya Salad both of which I order every time I go. What makes this restaurant stand out on Kingland Road's 'pho mile' is the lively atmosphere and quality of food, service and the value for money. It's also BYO which is a bonus. I discovered Miey Tay after it was mentioned on Gordon Ramsey's Best Restaurant and am very happy that I did. It is however a strangely well kept secret that I am more than happy to let slip. I only thing I would say is it does get very busy so I would highly recommend you book in advance to make sure you get a table. itsnosmallthing.weebly.c\u2026",

But I am wrong, its actually the overfloor section for Mien Tay... we go back out onto the street and enter. There are a rake of empty tables in the front half, but we are put down the back in the corner, squished in, surrounded by occupied tables. Odd really, but it amused me really.The staff are focused on serving quick and they don't really focus on the service with a smile tactic. Again something that amused me. And boy were they quick. All dishes were brought out in quicktime.We were visiting friends in London and this was their favourite Viet restaurant in the City, so we let them order and we shared everything.My highlights were the Octopus and Spring Rolls, as starters. For the mains I enjoyed the shredded duck, chicken curry and whole sea bass with ginger.There is an office licence two doors away from Mien Tay, it had a good selection of wine and beer, so get your BYOB here.I recommend Mien Tay, its was a bustling close up experience.",

They had a hard time taking down our orders despite seeing the menus for themselves and going sometimes by item number rather than what we said. Even still they forgot parts of peoples orders, especially the drinks part.I was at a ten top table for a birthday party and according to the birthday girl who reserved the table they started kicking us out of the space about 20 minutes before our allotted time was up. They were really trying to rush us out of there and even asked us to please leave at one point. I was about to say I'll try and come back here another time with a smaller group on a slower day but why bother? There's like five other vietnamese restaurants on the same friggin street.

The easily sat a large group of Yelpers, 10 in total, had no problem with us bringing our own booze and charged us \u00a38 a head to stuff our faces.

All the seating feels like they just bought it from a cheap patio sale. Wicker chairs are not comfortable to sit in for long periods of time, and even less comfortable to eat off of. Dusty fixtures and food stained walls are not appetizing to look at. But even besides all of that, I have to say that I've enjoyed everything I've had here. The food is fresh and tasty. But I don't recommend eating the garnish. It always look stale and old. Clearly it's just there for presentation. And at least there's no msg taste like in the place a few doors down....",

Good value and tasty food. Throwing in some extras like free prawn crackers to start and oranges (decoratively cut) at the end does no harm either!My favourite meal is the lunch menu Honey BBQ chicken with rice. It comes with a free vegetable soup, that tastes better than it should for that price. Plenty of veg and lots of egg, make this soup a perfect starter. Then the main, the honey glazed grilled pork is just charred to a tasty piece of perfect. Accompanied by some salad, rice and of course boiled rice. The rice is cooked here exactly as I like it. Not wet, nor too dry. Firm, and sticks to the chopsticks making for easy gripping. After that feast, you have of course the oranges chopped into segments with a toothpick, using the peel as a clever little bowl.If you're in the area on a weekday (which is the only time they do the lunch special I've just described, please get the Honey BBQ chicken. However I hear the Pho specials are good too. You just cannot go wrong here.",

There was very little carrot and daikon pickle (which I love), instead there was plenty of randomly shredded cabbage and carrots. The stir-fried onions was nice but the almost-raw-crunchy ones were a bit much for a weekday lunchtime - like hey, I have the rest of my day and the lovely squid gets a bit ruined by this strong, pungent flavour.For main, I had the bo luc lac - shaking beef 'salad'. In this case, it was still pretty tasty but not as authentic. Tasted like they had used some chinese 5 spice mix, but my experience with that mix has always been good so the dish in front of me was tasty and with that similar depth. Admittedly, my dish is bo luc lac and different places cook and serve it differently, so hey I am a bit extra in terms of standards, authenticity and taste - but every foodie has their preferences, eh?Try it if you are local, as you can work your way through Kingsland Road, but don't travel here especially.. its a-ok !",

But we were invited here as part of a friends birthday meal. There were a good group of us and we had to make sure we weren't more than 5 mins late of we'd loose our table! Upon arrival we were told 'You order now' when half of the table hadn't even sat in their seats. However, we got a couple of Vietnamese rolls, whole fish in chilli and beers for the table while everyone perused the menu. Another cute quirk to the place is the somewhat eerie scenes encased in the tables. Mini wells and dried out foliage trapped inside the glass made a great conversation piece with friends of friends you've never met. But overall the decore is modest and clean.Don't say Mien Tay doesn't give you choice, because oh boy do you get options. All 10 odd pages or so, which makes it just so much harder to decide! Eventually I opted for a mixed seafood in black bean sauce with egg fried rice (again, not particularly adventurous but I just couldn't decide in time!!). The food came out in what seemed like record timing. It was generous, fresh and really tasty. \u00a0The Spring rolls to start were equally as moreish and I would say a must when visiting. Everyone was making noises in appreciation and loosening their belts at the end of the meal. There were a modest selection of beers on offer, but wine was only served by the bottle - so get use to sharing. At the end of the meal, the bill came and I was amazed at the value. They must had knocked a few bits off the bill for us because we ended up with \u00a320 per head inc drinks. Bargain. Despite trying (and we did) not one of the staff cracked a smile the whole evening and after the last plate was taken away we were asked to leave! I will definitely go back and choose something a bit more adventurous on the menu next time. It's just great value and great food brought to your table quickly and with a whole heap of attitude.",

    "text": "Mien Tay is my favourite Vietnamese on Kingsland Road and you know they must be doing something right when they have two restaurants on the same road and both are almost always full! The reason this place gets five stars is the chargrilled goat which is not only a bit different but absolutely delicious. My boyfriend has tried the eel which is also delicious but we both agree the goat takes some beating. Starters include fresh rolls which are also really tasty. Its not a fancy restaurant and the food comes quickly. It might take a bit longer than you'd expect to get the staff's attention but that's because they are always so busy! Its delicious, inexpensive, honest food and the only place where I can get a G&T for \u00a33-4.",

    "text": "I made my way up Shoreditch to Kingsland to try Song Que per recommendation by a professor of mine. Upon entering Song Que, there was quite a queue to be seated, so I opted fow or the next most populous Vietnamese restaurant with available seating which turned out to be Mien Tay.I was promptly seated once I entered. After a through investigation of the menu, I narrowed down my selection to Pho, Bun Hue, and duck. I asked one of the servers what Bun Hue was, and she came out of the kitchen a minute later with a plate of the noodles; this gesture set the tone for the service. Anytime I looked up at a server, he or she immediately responded. Extremely attentive and helpful.I decided on a Bun Hue item entitled Spicy Vermicelli Soup with Beef. The portion was more than reasonable for \u00a36.50. I added chili peppers, cilantro, a few very small basil-like leaves, and what my very limited vocabulary of Vietnamese vegetables calls sprouts. The flavors interacted perfectly. The lemon grass did not overpower the thinly cut beef. The chili peppers cleaned my sinuses right up.To cool down I ordered a rainbow drink which contained mung beans, gelatinous seaweed, and coconut milk; I did not consume it properly at first, so one of the waiters came over and showed me how to properly enjoy the drink. It was an excellent supplement to the dish. I was very pleased with my experience.",

As such, i don't know if this place gets crowded on weekends.Service was fairly quick and everything that we ordered was quite good. Also, we got a bottle of wine for just under 15 GBP which seems reasonable for London.The only downside is that the place is fairly small and you wind up sitting quite close to other guests.All in all, I very much enjoyed dining here and would definitely return.",

    "text": "Walked by here on a stroll through Hoxton and decided to check the reviews on yelp before trying it. Brought my boyfriend as he had been craving for some good pho like we used to have as students in Vancouver, BC. We had some pretty high expectations (based on reviews and photos) plus we are kind of particular about our pho. My review is mainly concerned with the service we experienced, the pho turned out to be excellent.We went on a weekday at 4:30 before the dinner rush. I ordered the chicken and he ordered the beef brisket. The first thing I noticed was no matter what meat you chose, the broth is always beef. I'm not sure if other places do this but the restaurant I used to frequent in Vancouver made my chicken pho with chicken broth. The food came and to my surprise, we were served two bowls of beef. Additionally, the beef one brought to my boyfriend was not the type of beef he ordered. Just as we were about to say something a man and our server come over to our table. I mentioned the situation and I think they gave us a rushed apology but what I clearly is feeling like they barely acknowledged us and just treated us like we weren't there while they talked to themselves about the problem. The bowls were taken away, as well as the plate with the garnishes, and eventually replaced with what we actually ordered. Then they replaced the garnish plate with a different garnish plate and I was a bit disappointed since the new did not have as much basil. I don't really see the necessity to replace it when we didn't even touch it. I never found out what happened exactly but I guess there was a bit of a mix up in the kitchen. Since the pho was very good and I live close by, I would be willing to come back and try here again and hope this experience was just a one time accident!",

So instead he let out a big sigh and said pork and prawns like picture!! And we said ok let's get that. Biggest mistake the banh xeo was terrible flavorless . And the pho the pho is just as bad Avoid going here the place is a front for shit food and even shittier customer service don't be fooled by photos of Gordon and Benedict they're all a tie to fool you into eating here.

The broth of the chicken pho here is spot on, incredibly tasty and they are not shy with the ingredients. Highly recommend the bo la lot (grilled minced beef wrapped in betel leaf) as its just amazing. We also asked for extra lettuce and herbs for this dish, and they happily obliged. Their fried whole sea bream with green mango is also a winner. Definitely a favourite dish here. Their bo tai chan (raw beef salad) is also a favourite. Taste is great, portion is very good and still leaves you wanting more. Decor and ambiance feels very homey, overall a very good restaurant and highly recommend if you'd like to eat authentic Vietnamese food. Very reasonably priced too!",

It just played more on sour than spices.The showstopper, however, was the fried Sea Bream with Mango. It's a weird choice to flavor a very fresh fish with fermented fish sauce, but it worked. The mango may have been too bland to eat plain, but created a refreshing, tender slaw. And the fish was perfectly fried - the meat was still tender and moist, but most of the bones were fried enough to be crunchy additions instead of painful detractors. There were hardly any bones left when we were done with it.Also, I'm a sucker for a complimentary basket of Shrimp Chips and sliced orange to finish.",

I ordered number 141 on the menu, which was Vermicelli noodles with char grilled pork and spring rolls. The pork was tender and char grilled to perfection, and the spring rolls were crunchy and packed with delicious vegetables and meat. The mint, parsley, basil, lettuce, carrots and cucumbers were superbly crunchy. The noodles were springy and not overly cooked to mushiness. The fish sauce was sweet and tangy as it should always be. The textures and aromas of this delightful bowl were fresh and pleasing. This was perhaps the most delicious Vietnamese meal I have ever eaten in London. As for the staff, firstly I found that the waiters were somewhat brusque and unresponsive, making me and my party wait for half the time for tap water. This was a bit annoying, but we figured that we didn't need it right away. However. What saved the day was the friendly Vietnamese-Polish waiter who gave us our water happily and carried on a lively conversation about his home country and the languages that we both spoke. Overall, Mien Tay is a wonderful restaurant that makes you feel at home with its fantastic food and smiling staff.",

They have a separate express lunch menu which is incredibly cheap, most expensive dish \u00a37.50, which also comes with complimentary jasmine tea.I ended up going for the Brisket Pho. The stock packed so much flavour and the quality of the ingredients showed. I was tempted to get a starter of some sort and glad I didn't, as the main dish itself was extremely generous and I wouldn't have be able to eat anything more.100% worth a visit and good to try at lunch when it isn't as busy.

    "text": "With a small shopfront and windows plastered with adverts and stickers, from the outside it is hard to gauge what lies instore inside Mien Tay. But upon entering you come to realise that the restaurant is atmospheric and quirky, authentically Vietnamese and offers a good variety of menu options. The inside of the menu even includes a warm welcoming message from Mr Su Tran and Mrs My Le. In this message they have a mission statement to provide fresh and fragrant cooking and indeed this was reflected in what I was served with.\u00a0The pancake starter was a golden brown and crispy as it should be and the vegetables where crunchy-fresh. The fish sauce and soup base for the noodles were also pleasantly fragrant. Even the after-meal free oranges were nicely cut into pieces. The flowering tea is a nice touch to have available on the menu but be warned that the teapot is poorly designed as it allows a substantial amount of tea to trickle from the spout. The service was also a little off as the waiter is charming enough when taking orders but then takes your plate or bowl away far too quickly - basically when you have just taken your last bite he will pounce. Meanwhile the toilets have so much graffiti and stickers on display that it it looks as though they have let it get out of hand to avoid cleaning it up and in the hope that it appears creative. There is a mop in the toilet and an upstairs seating area that looked desolate and unused. So overall the aesthetics may need a little polishing but the food and drink here is true to form and genuinely good quality Vietnamese.",

The food was OK. Not a big deal really. Spring rolls as a started and chicken curry with rice for me. I was so hungry that I couldn't tell if the food was excellent (as it said in the front door of the restaurant), but I'm sure it's not the best I try. A little to much greasy I would said.The price is not too bad. You can have dinner for two for less than \u00a320. But don't expect anything fancy or elegant.

    "text": "Update I've returned to Mein Tay several times since my initial visit. While the food was always good when I visited, a friend of mine (who also loves Mein Tay) once took a few people there for lunch and said that not only was the food horrid, they managed to forget one dish even though they were the only guests at that time. And apparently the Vietnamese coffee they served was 90% condensed milk and 10% coffee. When I went there a few weeks ago, I ordered Prawn & Pork summer rolls. After eating a bit I realised that they were pork-less. I complained and first I was told that the waitress had misunderstood my order. When I asked to have the dish replaced the story was suddenly changed and I was told that the kitchen did not have any pork for the rolls. Although they brought me a pot of tea to compensate, I would have preferred to a) be notified that they were unable to serve me the ordered dish, instead of serving something different and hoping that I would not notice, or b) either replace the item or take it off my bill when I did notice. During the same visit a guy came in to tell the manager that they had charged his card twice for the same meal. After some hemming and hawing, they finally agreed that he could come round and have some food on the house, i.e. they were not willing to give him his money back. Having said all that, I still think that Mein Tay is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Shoreditch but I'm concerned that they are starting to go downhill as a result of their success. The lunch disaster indicates that they may have badly trained cooks in the kitchen during lunch. Their refusal to react appropriately to mistakes they made, i.e. overcharging customers or serving the wrong dishes, may fall back on them one day. I certainly hope not; watch this space for further updates. ##################### There is nothing to fault about this place. We had several starters, of which the superb summer rolls deserve an honourable mention. As a main course I had a lovely hot and sour Vietnamese fish soup. It was a huge portion but so good that I finished it off. We then ordered Vietnamese coffee and the super-lovely owner (previously metioned in other reviews), after hearing about my friend's trip to Vietnam, brought us a tea on the house after the coffee because 'in Vietnam they drink some tea after the coffee' - a very kind and sweet gesture.All of this combined with the huge portions and byo add up to the Mien Tay being my favourite Vietnamese in London, I'll be back for more!",

Its small ... its cramped ... it pretty much stretches my mental definition of a restaurant (as opposed to a take-away joint). But it serves very good and extremely cheap food. I am not qualified to judge how authentic the preparations were, but they were good enough for me not to care :)We were there in a big group of eight ... so we ordered a lot of stuff ... from egg fried rice to pho ... and shared. But the reason why i will remember this restaurant forever is that this is the first place where i had frog (or to be more precise, frog legs). They seemed to me to be quite like chicken leg pieces ... just substantially thinner.Mien Tay allows you to bring your own alcohol ... and given that its located right next to an off license shop, we could finish off 2 bottles of hastily purchased wine. After having a full and enjoyable meal, another surprise was in store for us ... the bill was only about \u00a310/person. It doesn't get any better, does it ?If you are looking for good, but not high-end, vietnamese food, then i highly recommend Mien Tay.",

Every week it seems a new restaurant opens up or closes down on Kingsland rd, I often consider writing a review of each one but I get as far as Mien Tay and I know, there's no need. K I might go on a bit, but it's worth it. This place used to be Thang Loi, which we loved. Yum. then one day pooof our favourite restaurant was called something else..untrusting but hungry we ventured in..the staff were a pleasure and helped us come to terms with the new menu which to my shock, no longer had my favourite dish on it (ca cha la vong). Not to be outdone, the owner rushed off and instructed the chef to make us the dish..and it was lovely! That gesture had me hooked..so we asked for recommendations. I'm telling you, you have to try the following: Salt chilli squid. It's too good! And, no lie, it was overheard that Chow Yun-Fat himself said it was the best he's ever had. Their version of summer rolls..exquisite! So fresh, the prawns..the mint.. Fish with mango and fish sauce..I was a bit dubious at first, but holy moly! Taste sensation! sizzling goat with galangal, try it! it's so good! I guess the best thing about Mien Tay is that the prices are as awesome as the food. It's incredibly cheap and is BYO so expect a shock when you get the bill! seriously, one of the tastiest meals you'll get in london and for about \u00a315..",

I can really recommend the won ton soup and the stir fried duck with bamboo shoots and chargrilled chicken with lemon leaf!",

    "text": "I totally agree with AnimalGirl - and can recount a very similar story! Living close by Thang Loi was our local and then one day we realised our fave dish (rabbit with honey) was not on the menu. We asked how long they had been open and it was about 4 weeks old. We tried the food and were blown away. The long long menu has so many amazing dishes on it it is so difficult to cut down when ordering. Highlights have to be salt and pepper squid, pork with honey and spices, seafood hot pot (def one for a group of friends), sizzling goat with galangal, frog's legs, beef salad, basically you could close your eyes, point at the menu and never be disappointed. I'm so tired of ordering I tend to ask the chef to make whatever he likes for us! Price is ridiculous, leave stuffed AND happy for about \u00a315! Unheard of in London. I can't recommend it highly enough. If you have a favourite Vietnamese on Kingsland Road give it a miss just once and try Mien Tay.",

    "text": "Have tried most of the Vietnamese restaurants in this area and finally got around to the Mien Tay restaurant, which was highly recommended by Time Out. I don't know why, it was truly awful. The restaurant has expanded into the shop next door, which is where they asked us to sit. Unfortunately the decoration is still unfinished, so it felt as if we were sitting in a building site. It was cold as well. The service wasn't good: they tried to rush us, and completely forgot about the squid starter. The food itself was terrible: the ribs were mostly fat, the squid (when it arrived) was bland, the chicken dish was mostly onions. the rice was broken up into many little pieces (so seemed more like cous-cous), and the shaking beef wasn't shaking at all, it had no life or flavour to it whatsoever. The portions of all of them were on the mean side (probably a good thing in retrospect). Visiting a restaurant is not just about the food, it is about the whole experience: the ambience of the place, the service, and about how comfortable the diner feels. This particular experience left a very nasty taste in the mouth: both literally and figuratively. The disappointment and feeling of being ripped-off was very strong. Based on this visit, one wonders how this place attracts customers at all.",
