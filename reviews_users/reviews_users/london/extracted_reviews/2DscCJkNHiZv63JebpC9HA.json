    "text": "Welcome to the home of the MAI TAI! The founder of this restaurant supposedly created the drink for his friends visiting from Tahitit! He opened the original Vic's in California and included his drink on the menu. Now it's become a world-wide sensation.Located in a hidden away area, under the Hilton, it's pretty hard to find. I would have been roaming around London for a while if my friend's cab had not picked me up. Shame that it's not more advertised/present because I really enjoyed this place. Lots of tropical decor and tribal masks really set what they describe as a Polynesian atmosphere. Strange as the place is pretty upscale but it just works. I would definitely dress up a bit to go here, especially if I were sitting in one of the more secluded dining tables. \u00a0The food is no-doubt pricey but understandably so as a lot of their meat is cooked in the 'roti' style, meaning that it's roasted in a traditional wood-fired oven. Also explains why it takes a while for it to come!The place was packed when I came here, with live music and dancing in the Mai Tai Lounge. They boast over 200 cocktails and I tried umm...a few. They hit my friends pretty hard but I found them to just be quite tasty. My friend's beef was great although my aromatic duck was objectively a bit too crunchy and oily. However, I loved it! Basically if you want an upscale place to drink, eat great food, and dance with an exclusive London club nearby (Whisky Mist), this place can't be beat! PS: Book reservations if you can, especially on weekends!",

My first visit wasn't great but maybe I'm a little raw about being told that I can't stand next to a table to talk to a friend (as it's not that kind of bar) or that the service charge doesn't reflect the forty minute time taken to get a drink ordered or seated next to fantastically large stewpots meant a five degree rise in ambient temperature. A second visit thanks to My Kind Of phone and Qype proved a different experience with access to the Kon Tikki canoe filled with a orange based punch and some strong signature Mai Tais. I guess it could have been an unlucky first visit, the service from the staff that night was exemplary and live music is rather special if you're lucky enough to be seated in that quadrant. The porcelain cocktail bowls are very unique and are very pretty. The decor hasn't changed (and doesn't need to) since the swinging sixties with the old bamboo and grass adorning gurning faces from the walls. Look out for the cheeky sailor on the way to the toilets, Chatham will never seem the same again. If the prices seem a little steep, remember that it is a five star cocktail bar and that the drinks include the history and experience of the venue, which does make for an incredibly special night out.",

When I stepped through the door and was greeted by Polynesian statues, I got the giggles - this would be fun, I thought to myself! As I walked down the stairs, there was a mix of decor - from the carpet that seemed like it belonged in a Ruby Tuesday's to the coral, shells, tiki men and ... oh my gosh is that really a canoe filled with fruity cocktails?! Indeed, folks! This place is full-on themed from the walls to the staff. It seemed out of place for the location, but the clientele was easy on the eye! ;) They had a great bar and the staff was very attentive.

    "text": "Trader Vic's is my bar of choice for a more sophisticated and relaxed tiki experience. The bar boats all of the old-world Polynesian charm that you will take you away to another time and place, and opts for the more up-market decor. Easily surpassing the likes of Mahiki on this front, expect canoes suspended from the ceiling, illuminated puffer fish and nautical nick-knacks. The cocktails are simply excellent and the four page menu offers a huge range that will keep even the most ardent lush busy for days to come. Price-wise it's on par with most London tiki bars and you should be prepared to part with between \u00a39 and \u00a312 for a drink, but, perhaps unusually for most London cocktail bars, Trader Vic's leaves you feeling that you've actually had rather good value for money. The drinks are served in generous vessels and the bartenders are liberal with the alcohol, so expect to feel lightheaded after having a few! For those who can't do without themed mugs and sharers, there is a generous selection that will see you sipping from barrels and bowls. If you feel like splashing out for a party, be sure to opt for the ten-gallon canoe. I sampled this during a Qype event and I guarantee that it will impress your guests. Trader Vic's is a serious candidate for a 5 star rating. With an impeccable setting, a warm and welcoming atmosphere and top-quality cocktails, I have no hesitation in giving it my highest commendation.",

Themed cocktails seem to be what everyone admires about the place, and the ten gallon canoe from which drinks can be served is certainly a talking point - if a little too gimmicky in my opinion. It is listed as a restaurant and although I have not eaten a proper meal there, I must say the pork ribs and fried prawns made for an excellent snack. The restaurant meals are presumably of a polynesian theme and good too. Most impressive for me were the staff who were professional and courteous.

We had ended up here after a Foodie treasure hunt sponsored by My Kind of Phone, using our mobiles to take photos of various food related sights on the way from Covent Garden. A lot of fun that was too, but it was nice to finish with a canoe full of rum punch. Fruity and light this refreshing beverage was in sharp contrast with the Mai Tai's which, while tasty were clearly extremely alcohol-heavy..! Anyway, it's a fantastic place, right by/underneath the Park Lane Hilton hotel with bamboo and woodcarvings covering every corner and setting the atmosphere wonderfully. I hear this place has been going since the 60s and I can well believe it because of the attention to detail which doesn't just settle in overnight - this place is pretty immersive. The food we had was a selection of nibbles and it whet the appetite for more. Jucy ribs, delicious pork, prawns and some unidentified wonton - was it crab? was it cheese? who knew but some people were addicted..",

There's something for everyone here, non-cocktail drinkers get a wide selection of beers and cocktail drinkers are literally spoiled for choice. I recently went here for a Qype event, and tried Trader Vic's food for the first time. I have to say that I was seriously impressed and will be sampling them again. The highlight was a crab and cheese bite, that the Qypers were addicted to, but the spare ribs were also fantastic. The barbecue sauce that was used was just the right side of sticky and not to sweet. The highlight of the visit was definitely the wooden canoe, a life-size canoe filled with a delicious peach flavoured punch that guests can book for a very special occasion.",

    "text": "I went along for a Qype event culminating here after a foodie treasure hunt. The Polynesian themed bar was apt for my treasure hunt buddy (and Qype-God) Tiki Chris. He's famous for shirts, in fact I confused his Hawaiian-sartorial style with one of the bar tenders also working (and failing) the Tiki Chris style. (Disclaimer: I have 5 Hawaiian shirts, I will wear one of my next visit.) We enjoyed a ten gallon 'drinking canoe' filled with peach rum punch and some meaty snacks. I pondered how as a lifetime Londoner with encyclopaedic knowledge of places and venues how I had never knew of this place that has existed. It apparently has been going for the (virtually unchanged) Tahitian/Polynesian theme bar since the 60's under the behemoth iconic Hotel that is the Hilton Park Lane. We went through our slideshow of photos we'd uploaded on the treasure hunt. In fact, I won an XBOX live gold membership for my super photos). We also got a demo from Microsoft of the new mobile operating system showing the customisable slick 'Metro' aesthetic style that makes navigating the phone much like working out how to navigate a decent metro system. The Mia Tai's packed a punch too and some live guitar dude starting strumming a Latino-polynesian vibe. I went to check it out, thinking for a moment that Polynesian strummer heavy-weight (literally) Mr Israel Kamakawiwoole may have been resurrected as to provide some extra authenticity. It wasn't, but enjoy his sounds and imagine sipping a Mai Tai on a palm tinged island: under Park Lane.Video link: youtube.com/watch?v=V1bF\u2026",

Opened in 1963, this swank tropical-themed restaurant/bar has much of the same decor as when opened. It's definitely of another time but not really passe or run-down. In fact, it appears to have been lovingly cared for all these decades.

    "text": "Located on the bottom floor of the Hilton hotel on London's posh Park Lane, this historic tiki bar is one of the few original Trader Vic's locations remaining in the world, and the first to open outside of the USA in 1963. The interior is spacious, with an enormous dining room surrounding two different tiki bars. The decor is authentic but dated, incorporating various elements of high tiki and Hawaiiana. The attempt at an upscale establishment falls short, due to important aspects such as lighting. For some reason, all of the lamps on the ceiling were turned off, creating an awkwardly dim setting. Service was elusive, and unable to describe anything on the menu. The drinks were terrible. I got the Tiki Puka Puka (\u00a315) which tasted like artificial fruit juice and a measured pour of low grade spiced rum. It was not strong by any means, and charging this price for what was essentially a watery slushy is unacceptable. My boyfriend got the 'Mai Tai Wave' (\u00a316) which is a flight of three different Mai Tais from the menu-Guava, Mango, and Maui (pineapple). They were all drinkable, but contained no alcohol. We attempted to mix the cocktails to make them better somehow, but they were bad beyond repair. We could not bring ourselves to order another, but stayed a while to enjoy the ambiance. With such an incredible space, I hope that Trader Vic's London considers refreshing their decor, and significantly improving their libations.",

I ordered the beef cho cho, spare ribs, and the sampler. The spare ribs have a smoked wood Taste and are very flavorful. The beef cho cho comes with a fire goblet that you can roast your skewers over. The sampler comes with fried shrimps, a spare rib, and crab ragu. Overall the appetizers were good and flavorful I will have to try dinner next time I'm in London.",

Absolutely loved our food, the old way chow mein and the cosmo tidbit plates, as well as the drinks we tried, the Mai tai sampler and the pogo stick which comes with a sugar swizzle stick of rock candy! Andras and OJ took awesome care of us and even treated us by offering a complete tour and behind the scenes look in the bar and kitchen! They went above and beyond! Loved our time! Thank you Trader Vic's! Hopefully we'll be back soon!",

We even asked them to see if they could turn on the regular lights and they couldn't. Very strange. Then the DJ had some kind of seizure or something, and the music was a mess - the volume kept going up and down abruptly, and it was really awkward and loud. Folks were leaving right away because the music was a mess and clearly something was wrong... we bailed. What a mess. Mess!",

This place is located in the lower level of the Hilton hotel and doesn't open until 5pm (which we learned the hard way). \u00a0We arrived right when they opened, so it wasn't crowded at all. There were lots of tables, but we opted to sit at the bar. They have happy hour, so we were happy to be there during that to take advantage of a discount. There were lots of choices and we all ordered different drinks and everyone liked everything. We watched the bartender make them all and he measured out everything and you could tell that the drinks were very balanced and didn't taste too strong. The d\u00e9cor is what you'd expect in a Tiki bar and was it was dark. I'm not sure if that's normal or not, but it's because it's in the lower level of the hotel. I'd go back here during happy hour to try some of their other cocktails. I could see this being a fun place for a big group of people.",

The ribs are delicious - and tasty, no need for the accompanying dips. Known for their cocktails in branded cups, they are evolving their London menu to make it much more of a destination dining spot.It was Vic \"The Trader\" Bergeron who first put Chinese dishes alongside contemporary Continental cuisine in the late 1930s, creating the original fusion menu. It's much the same today, but true to their slogan \"Taste The World\" you can expect some updates to the menu in the next few months.The tapa cloth wallpaper used in Trader Vic's comes from Tonga, where paper mulberry trees are sliced, starched and hand- painted to create these exotic textures and patterns.Each piece is different, and made individually for the 26 Trader Vic's restaurants around the world.Call 020 7208 4113 or email tradervics.parklane@hilt\u2026To celebrate the 4th of July \u00a0Delicious!
