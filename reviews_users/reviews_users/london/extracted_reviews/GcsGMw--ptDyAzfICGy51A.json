In fact, I was upset because it was the first time since I can remember being in love with food that I wasn't able to finish a delicious meal. I'm never one to let food go to waste - one of my pet peeves. I love food way too much to see it being shamelessly left all on its lonesome. I went to East Street with the expectation of actually being disappointed (after a friend, who I no longer consider a friend with good food taste, told me). Boy was that friend wrong. I ordered a simple Yaki udon. I say simple because there were actually far more interesting things to order (everything from Singaporean food to Thai spice) on the menu but I literally just wanted some fat noodles with chicken and prawns. But wow, wow, wow did they do remarkable job of it! Granted, we split starters (prawn tempura and veggie spring rolls) because, well, why the hell would you skip starters?! I normally can devour any portion of food in front of me. The portion that East Street served was fantastic in all aspects: size, taste, and presentation. I definitely recommend going here on a somewhat empty stomach (although don't you dare skip brekkie or lunch!). I'm definitely going back soon to restore faith in myself.",

    "text": "My New Favourite Restaurant We wondered into East Street after a few hours hunger inspiring work (read: shopping in the New Year sales). We had initially been heading to Ping Pong so broke left off Oxford street on our way to Goodge Street. East Street's colourful interior and vibrant menu caught our eye and on closer inspection the menu was exactly what we were looking for. A cheerful waiter greeted us at the door and the place was pretty empty save for a few tables at the back so we had a choice of where to sit. We picked a table in the corner and got busy reading the menu. Our hunger meant we ordered pretty much the first things we saw but I kept hold of the menu once we'd ordered to have a proper look at it (call me strange but I love reading menus! Preferably when I'm not hungry or if my food is already on its wayhowever, trying to enjoy reading a menu when I'm starving hungry and incapable of making a decision is not so fun!). The menu is a complete mixture of dishes from Asia, including countries that often get forgotten in UK restaurants, such as The Philippines. The prices are pretty similar to somewhere like Wagamama so definitely wont break the bank and the lunch menu is certainly more than value for money. Inside, the venue is great, really colourful and quite similar to Wahaca but perhaps a bit more character \u00a0receipts and leaflets from various Asian countries cover one of the walls at the back and other nice touches like this add personality to the slightly industrial look.The music was great \u00a0some of my favourite tunes came on while we were there and music is perhaps more important to me than it might be to others. The staff were all attentive, not overly so, efficient and friendly Anywayto the food! My other (better) half went for the Eastern Express lunch time Special Menu \u00a0a mountain of food for \u00a37.95 that included tasty corn fritters (Tod Man Kao from Thailand) with a chilli and peanut dip \u00a0the perfect amount of batter and vegetables to give you that satisfying crunch without feeling it's too bad for you!Also included was a fiery chicken breast dish from Vietnam with green peppers, carrots, chillies and lemongrass, served with jasmine rice. The dish was called Ga Xao Xa Ot \u00a0I guess that's Vietnamese for Absolutely delicious! The delicate flavours all held their own amongst some pretty strong spice and it certainly helped clear the sinuses! I ordered miso soup to start with \u00a0not something I'd normally order in a restaurant but I needed something to warm up fast. In my experience, Miso Soup isn't usually high on taste but fills you up nicelywell this one was delicious \u00a0who knew soya bean paste could make something so appetizing! It came with various pickled veg to put into the soup or eat on the side if you'd prefer (I couldn't tell you what they were, apart from the ginger which I recognised!). To follow (although it all came at the same time so I don't think I really needed to bother with the Miso Soup, even though it was delicious) I had the Chicken Katsu Curry from Japanand thumbs up for East Street \u00a0the sauce had a gentle spice and more flavour than I'd tasted in a Katsu curry before. It was also a perfect consistency, not gloopy like they can sometimes be at other similar restaurants (not naming any names!) We were too full for dessert, although the menu was more than tempting. We did have a Vietnamese coffee though which was beautifully presented and delicious. The 'East Street' rock sweeties was a nice touch at the end and the bill was a nice surprise \u00a0less than \u00a325 for all of the above \u00a0we will be back for sure. My only worry is that these standards might not be upheld when they get much busier \u00a0which they certainly will \u00a0East Street rocks!",

    "text": "Came here with a few of my coworkers for a weeknight dinner. It was busy, but we only had about a 15 minute wait before we were seated, during which time we took the opportunity to decide what we wanted. We liked the vibe - very casual, with lots of benches and low stools instead of chairs, and a kind of unfinished urban vibe with fake signs all over the place. They brought us a complimentary red bush tea, a room temp, subtle tea that I really liked.My favorite part, though, was the food. I enjoyed the pan-asian options and how the menu specified hotness level, vegetarian, vegan, and dishes under 600 calories. I ordered the vegan version of the Molee Curry from Singapore, one of the less than 600 cal dishes, and it was SO delicious. I'm a big fan of creamy coconut things, and once I managed to let the dish cool down, it was fantastic to the point where I keep thinking about it and salivating. It reminded me a bit of an Indian korma. My friends all enjoyed their dishes, as well, and we all shared to get a taste of everything. The prawn crackers with chilli sauce were also a delicious starter.If you are okay with a bit of a wait, a less comfortable seat, and very casual vibe, the food is the highlight of East Street, I think.",

It's set up like a really colorful street market, which add to the fun and busy environment created by the welcoming staff. I came here with my sister not too long ago and was impressed by the speed in which we were served. They have a great selection of dishes from all across Asia, and part of the kitchen is open so you can see your meal being cooked. It's also very reasonably priced (about \u00a315 a head with crackers to start).The only thing slight let-down is the food. The portion size is fantastic, and they use great ingredients. But it's not that much better than other places I had the same dishes, or what I could do at home. The ambiance of the place is what carries it. A brilliant quick-safe-bet-on-a-budget type place, but the food could be tastier.",

So that's all fine -- if you want to have lunch on the set of a dystopian science fiction film, East Street is for you. I would not attempt to have a meeting there unless my meeting was with Alex from A Clockwork Orange or Galvatron.No, what really lets East Street down is the food. In a town that is so well stocked with exceptional Asian cuisine, why on earth would you settle for the bland fare at East Street? My pad kra prow was so under-spiced it could have been served as airline food. The broth in my lunch-mate's pho gha was thin and tasteless. The tod man khao pod fritters were absolutely delicious, but by the time they'd arrived I'd gone deaf and had developed epilepsy.",

East Street was always on my radar and I finally got to satisfy my Asian (fusion) taste buds...This instantly became one of my favourite restaurants. The decor made me feel as though I stepped into a Tokyo based film set. They offer an Eastern express menu where a limited selection of food is available at 7.95 between 12pm-7pm. However, I opted to go all out and chose a starter, main and dessert from the standard menu. I recommend the starter platter for 2 to share. It offered a varied selection of Asian starters. Absolutely yummy for the empty tummy! For the main, being Filipino myself, I just had to choose a filipino dish (chicken adobo), to see whether it lived up to my standards. Sadly, it wasn't as good as how my mama makes it, thus knocking off a star. And of course, there is always room for dessert. I decided on the fried banana dessert with ice cream, which was a very good choice.",

No not the market, the Pan-Asian (cringe) eatery in Soho.If you like Wagammas, you'll like East Street. It's budget food, that's hot and tasty with service that actually smiles. East Street is actually Tampopo, re-branded for a London audience. \u00a0If you didn't know already, Tampopo is a small chain across the UK in various shopping centres serving up a similar Asian cuisine. It has been described as a \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" but I have a higher opinion of it than others.Don't stop reading now. This place is certainly worth a visit. They have a interesting menu with a selection of dishes for Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and more. Granted, they do taste very much like each other, but are served up generously and for a snip of the price of other places. They don't hold back on the veg and everything comes out freshly cooked. I ate Nasa Goreng which was nothing like the authentic dishes they serve up at Rasa Sayang, but still enjoyable. There was a lack of a whole fried egg on top and they didn't serve Satay on the side.I had a side of Korean beef which was accompanied by Kimchee. Again, really generous portions of beef, seasoned and cooked beautifully but the Kimchee was a little off. It just didn't taste quite right, still tasty, just not particularly authentic.I work on Rathbone Street in Soho. The advantage and disadvantage of this is the array of tasty food options at my fingertips as I roll out of the office. I ate at East Street twice the week I discovered it. It's good. Considering this place is in the heart of Oxford Street's shopping area, it's perfectly priced and you can pretty much ensure you'll always get a seat.It's also good to note that these guys also have a selection of Asian sauces and products for you to buy. They're marked slightly higher than you can get in Chinatown but they really add to the authentic feel (think; I'm eating in a market). The whole place is decorated with large neon signs which everyone seems to like, even if they aren't always spelt correctly.I can't help but like this place and everyone who come here, foodie or not, seems to agree with me. It's a gem and a welcome addition to the Wahaca, Pho and Moolis genre in Soho.",

Previously it has a unique offering in that you could order from a map of Asia, seeing which country the dish you were ordering originated from. Now that's gone and what you have is a good range of Asian food which tastes fine. It won't blow your mind but you'll happily finish your plate.It's a good place for big groups and they'll happily take drinks orders and serve you while you wait for a table but I'm not sure it will be a place a frequent with pals.",

My main recommendation would be the bulhogi beef (might have spelt that wrong). A starter but it's delicious!The restaurant atmos is really cool as well, styled like a Thailand street market with some tacky advertising screens up for a bit realism and the waiters kitted out in old school football kits. Even the toilets have a really cool Thai airport effect where it sounds like your in a waiting area with flight announcements being played. Strange the first time you hear it but quirky.Definitely recommend this restaurant.",

Taking inspiration from the hawker street markets of south east Asia, East Street excels in offering a wide array of well-priced small plates of Asian street food. East Street earns mad props for the atmosphere, down to the tacky cheap plastic red seats to the Thai and Vietnamese signage for beer and girlie bars....it really feels like you are in a Bangkok street market.As for the food...it's solid but not outstanding. Really like the menu....there were probably a dozen things I wanted to try...everything from gyoza to Vietnamese spring rolls to countless Thai soups. Overall East Street is a well conceived budget priced foodie concept. I'll be back.",

I was pleased to see that I was torn between two dishes and eventually settled on one. The food arrived promptly and was delicious! The portions are medium sized, definitely enough for one person. The staff were friendly and returned during the meal to make sure all was well. The focus is definitely on the idea of street food as the decor all consisted of street signs and benches. Overall, a pleasant experience. Will be visiting again to try something new!",

It was great to have our pick of the menu, and absolutely no trouble getting them to honor the contest prize. To start, I had the London Mule to drink, which felt spicy with the ginger beer, but still delicious to drink. I had gzoya as my appetizer, and my entree was the chicken pad thai. My friend and I split the cinnamon and chocolate mini ice cream as our dessert. It was a delicious, and deliciously large, meal. It came out quickly from the kitchen, and the server we had was as attentive as he could be as the London dinner rush began.The atmosphere within East Street is really cool, with the pseudo-Asian signs, industrial design focus, and bright colors. It certainly harkens to a tiny restaurant in China where you order and watch your food being made. While East Street is much larger, it still retains that small feeling, which makes it even tastier and more authentic.",

    "text": "My New Favourite RestaurantWe wondered into East Street after a few hours hunger inspiring work (read: shopping in the New Year sales). We had initially been heading to Ping Pong so broke left off Oxford street on our way to Goodge Street.East Street's colourful interior and vibrant menu caught our eye and on closer inspection the menu was exactly what we were looking for. A cheerful waiter greeted us at the door and the place was pretty empty save for a few tables at the back so we had a choice of where to sit.We picked a table in the corner and got busy reading the menu. Our hunger meant we ordered pretty much the first things we saw but I kept hold of the menu once we'd ordered to have a proper look at it (call me strange but I love reading menus! Preferably when I'm not hungry or if my food is already on its way...however, trying to enjoy reading a menu when I'm starving hungry and incapable of making a decision is not so fun!).The menu is a complete mixture of dishes from Asia, including countries that often get forgotten in UK restaurants, such as The Philippines. The prices are pretty similar to somewhere like Wagamama so definitely wont break the bank and the lunch menu is certainly more than value for money.Inside, the venue is great, really colourful and quite similar to Wahaca but perhaps a bit more character - receipts and leaflets from various Asian countries cover one of the walls at the back and other nice touches like this add personality to the slightly industrial look.The music was great - some of my favourite tunes came on while we were there and music is perhaps more important to me than it might be to others. The staff were all attentive, not overly so, efficient and friendlyAnyway...to the food! My other (better) half went for the Eastern Express lunch time Special Menu - a mountain of food for \u00a37.95 that included tasty corn fritters (Tod Man Kao from Thailand) with a chilli and peanut dip - the perfect amount of batter and vegetables to give you that satisfying crunch without feeling it's too bad for you!Also included was a fiery chicken breast dish from Vietnam with green peppers, carrots, chillies and lemongrass, served with jasmine rice. The dish was called Ga Xao Xa Ot - I guess that's Vietnamese for \"Absolutely delicious\"! The delicate flavours all held their own amongst some pretty strong spice and it certainly helped clear the sinuses!I ordered miso soup to start with - not something I'd normally order in a restaurant but I needed something to warm up fast. In my experience, Miso Soup isn't usually high on taste but fills you up nicely...well this one was delicious - who knew soya bean paste could make something so appetizing! It came with various pickled veg to put into the soup or eat on the side if you'd prefer (I couldn't tell you what they were, apart from the ginger which I recognised!).To follow (although it all came at the same time so I don't think I really needed to bother with the Miso Soup, even though it was delicious) I had the Chicken Katsu Curry from Japan...and thumbs up for East Street - the sauce had a gentle spice and more flavour than I'd tasted in a Katsu curry before. It was also a perfect consistency, not gloopy like they can sometimes be at other similar restaurants (not naming any names!)We were too full for dessert, although the menu was more than tempting. We did have a Vietnamese coffee though which was beautifully presented and delicious.The 'East Street' rock sweeties was a nice touch at the end and the bill was a nice surprise - less than \u00a325 for all of the above - we will be back for sure.My only worry is that these standards might not be upheld when they get much busier - which they certainly will - East Street rocks!Ps. I have been back a few times and am still impressed",

    "text": "Let's talk about the food first, it wasn't bad at all, even though it wasn't the \"It's amazing!\" kind of Asia food experience. But the flavour was good! The menu was decent. Lack of hot drinks though.I love the interior design, it's a good concept. Especially the signs on the ceiling and the plastic chairs. Love it! I think it's quite unique (at least in London). Why I give it a 2-star review? Let me explain, it was a rainy late morning, we saw the \"stop\" sign on the street, so we stopped and looked at the menu outside. We wanted to go in but we saw the opening hours was from 12noon. We were (less than 10 mins) early, so we waited a little bit outside. We walked in at 11:59am, the manager-looking staff saw us and said it still got 2 mins before noon, and told us to get back outside and wait... Hmmm... Felt a bit off-putting to be told to get out and wait just because we were 1 min early (2 mins referred to him). Maybe they could have locked the door, or kept the outdoor tables, chairs and the A-frame inside if they didn't want customers to get in 1-2 mins before noon. They came out and let us in about 7-10 mins past 12. They weren't rude, it was just odd. If it was me, I'd tell the customers in, sit them down and let them know there'll be a couple of mins to wait before they can order. We were the only customers, and they were not busy. It's their choice to be flexible or rigid. Guess they chose the latter. It won't stop me from going there, but it wasn't a pleasant first experience to East Street.p.s.: Their menu and table got (dry and wet) food stains, can someone keep them clean please?!",

If I weren't dying to have some fried rice would probably try to avoid going to places like these in London just because it does break my heart to pay for a dish that costs 10x from its from. Nevertheless, this is pretty much the closest you can get to experience the hawker/street food ambience. The interior design is pretty on point, just much cleaner and prettier than what a local street stall would be. At least you don't have to worry bout having a bad tummy! I know I shouldn't compare, can't help it..I've been here twice, and the quality of food is good. Of course not on par with the ones you get in S.E.A but its close. I previously ordered the Malaysia Satay Chicken & Rice - \u00a37.95. Peanut sauce was ON POINT. Almost cried because I missed it so much. This time I got the Indonesian Style Chicken Fried-Rice, and would say that it's alright. Lacks a bit of flavour, idk how to explain this but it's not bad. They got the spicy part right though. I also got the Vietnamese Coffee \u00a32.20. Nobody says no to Vietnamese Coffee, if you haven't had one.m before. Get it. Food portions are huge, very generous.

East Street was busy but we were seated right away. The atmosphere is set up like the streets of a southeast Asian city. East Street has a bunch of tropical cocktails but I just ordered a mint tea for \u00a31.90. The tea came in a clear mug stuffed with beautiful sprigs of mint. Pretty!I liked how the menu featured dishes from across Asia, including lesser-represented countries like Singapore and Indonesia, though I was boring and stuck to the old faithful, Pad Thai. The chicken version is \u00a39.50 and the veggie version a little less. A lot of the dishes on the menu have little chili pepper symbols by their names, so I was a little wary of ordering something with one pepper and having my tongue fall off; that's why I stuck to the safe Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was fine but nothing particularly memorable. More memorable was the order of Thai coconut prawns that my friend shared with me. Really crispy and shrimpy. Recommended.The service was rather attentive; the folks working seemed to be maybe college students.A-OK.",

    "text": "A pan Asian restaurant serving dishes from the orient from Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and more. Most of the time I come here for the atmosphere rather than the food as it is quite reminiscence of the outdoor scene of most capitals of Asia from the neon signs hanging down from the ceiling lighting the dimmed down restaurant. It's also convenient located off the side street of Oxford Street yet being very spacious it never feels too busy and takes you out of the hustle and bustle of the shopping scene. Service is also really friendly and efficient. Thai hot and sour soup (vermicelli)Not as aromatic as the ones you get from a Thai restaurant but still very flavourful. It had a good dose of sourness and zestiness notes in there and seasoned perfectly. The vermicelli noodles were fresh and al dente and made the dish more substantial along with the cherry tomatoes Fresh Vietnamese Summer Rolls (vegetarian)Quite a refreshing dish but heavily relied on the really well made hoisin and peanut dip for flavour. The sauce was thick and sticky and gave the roll the rich moreish umami and sweet nuttiness flavours. However on its own it would have been quite poor as the vegetables inside were dried out. Luckily the vermicelli noodles were freshly cooked, moist and bouncy to keep the roll airy. The side of lettuce also help retain some moisture in the roll Vietnamese Style Chicken SaladThis was incredibly moreish and refreshing especially on a hot summer's day. They got the fish sauce marinade perfect, a good ratio of sour, sweet and savoury with the generous crushed peanuts adding another dimension of flavour. The grilled chicken itself was nicely charred adding a nice smokiness and umami. All the different textures gave the dish a wonderful bite. Highly recommendMini Singaporean Laksa Soup Nothing amazing or fancy but quite the standard flavours you find in a laksa but in a mini rice bowl size. It was very mild and rich in coconut flavour. Had enough spice in there to keep the flavours interesting but lacked the depth and complexity of a true authentic laksa. It was more for familiarity and comfort especially with the bouncy egg noodles and charred chicken breast Rendang roti bites The highlight of this dish was definitely the braised beef, slow cooked till the meat was lovely and tender. They were incredibly juicy too, soaking all the lovely rich spices and savoury marinade with strong notes of star anise too. Placed on top of small roti triangles which were mediocre but soft enough to soak the sauce Thai curry noodles This was surprisingly good. The red curry had a wonderful thick and creamy consistency that bind onto the thin egg noodles well so a good amount of flavours were delivered in each bite. The spices were very mild but build up some heat as you eat it. It also had enough depth and flavour to make it a great noodle dish Vietnamese Pho Noodles (chicken) Probably a dish to avoid as the main part being the broth was very weak and too heavy on the sour notes. The seasoning was fine though which made it edible but just lacked depth and complexity. Ho fun noodles were poor quality, the rehydrated ones and were very broken so none of them remained as long strips but just lots of short ones. The highlight was probably the side of authentic Vietnamese greens including mint, Vietnamese basil and beansprouts which made the dish more fragrant and added a good contrast of texture against the brittle noodles I do love East Street. It's definitely on the pricey end for Oriental food with a lot of the dishes costing above the \u00a310 mark and the lunch menu is only available on weekedays. To me it's quite like Wagamama with it's large extensive menu to suit everyone. Food is nothing amazing or 'authentic' but gives you comfort, good portions and all seasoned well. A great place with a large group of friends.",

There are some sauces on the table to add extra flavour if required.The service is usually friendly decor has lots of bright coloured signs hanging from the ceiling and corrugated iron on the walls gives it a bit of a street feel.They have lunch time menu and offers of you join the mailing list. Think they also have student discount.",

You can immediately compare its menu to that of franchise Wagamama's so I was hoping this place would blow Waga's out of the park. I got the Pad Thai. My partner got the Katsu Curry. Typical Waga choices. The Katsu curry was (apparently) just as nice as Waga's. My Pad Thai.... I was a little disappointed. It was okay. A little bland but more importantly I paid \u00a31 extra for some chicken... Well what chicken is all I can say. There were a few little scraps hiding at the bottom. One of which was 90% gristle. If I'm paying extra for so chicken at least have a some meaty chucks in there for me to chill into. So I guess I agree with the other reviews that the food doesn't really live up to scratch.",

    "text": "I was really excited to visit East Street for lunch last week. It was definitely a very good concept. One of the best food in Asia is street food and most of the items on the menu are those. I only managed to have the Curry Laksa noodle and I had to say that I was very disappointed by it. The curry soup had not much flavor to it. I'm not sure which version of curry laksa that they were trying to make because it doesn't taste like the northern Malaysia's curry laksa nor the Singaporeans. It just didn't pack the flavor that it needed. It had all the garnishing that would typically be omitted out when eating outside of Asia but the soup just wasn't right. The curry laksa had chicken in it that I thought tasted a little weird and it took me a while to figure out why it taste that way. The chicken is probably pre-cooked at some point and just added into the soup after someone orders the dish to save time. In this way, the chicken is not flavorful because it wasn't cooked in a broth.Service was fast and friendly. I have seated right away during lunch time and it wasn't very packed. I got my food within a few minutes of the order being taken. \u00a0Overall I was fairly disappointed after my meal. It was probably my fault as I was really expecting some good street food from Asia. \u00a0The unfortunate thing about restaurant goers is that you will never return back if your first experience is bad with the food so I doubt I'll be back.",

Distracting, but awesome!3 stars for:- our slightly disappointing mains: over-salty Chicken Adobo, and Com Hu\u00e9 - Vietnamese fried rice, where the rice was too soft and mushy and the flavors were indistinct. All around not very impressed with these - they were ok.- odd and awkward service- very loud noise level. A big room full of people talking loudly over loud music.All told, though, I would definitely come back and try other options. The menu was vast and there were many things I wanted to eat.",

It works well with groups of 8 or so too. East Street offers the usual Thai red and green curries, pad Thai, laska soups, prawn crackers and the like, in big portions with a smile. The staff are super friendly; their big smiles can cheer you up during/after a very grumpy day at work. Lunch times after 1pm can get quite crowded though, service will of course be sparser and slower then. Be forewarned, choices on the menu with extra chili pepper logos next to them are indeed spicy ... not the British, Waitrose version of spicy.Tip: they have a special lunch menu which is slightly more cheaply priced than dinner, with the same heaps of food served.I particularly like this place for dinner as it tends to be less crowded than some of the trendier spots nearby. It is also a good place to meet friends from out of town, as if they don't know London it's quite easy to find.",
