It's a big restaurant, seating up to 150 and yet they are almost dictatorial re seating even on two occasions with an empty restaurant, which for a single woman with with book seeking a fortifying Pho with spicy mango salad is generally either by the front door, away from the actual restaurant or in a corner so dark it's impossible to read or on one occasion on a shared table. I was interested to note that the guy in the review above also had a problem with seating as did my freinds when they went. The food...is just okay....I found the Pho to be greasy and heavy not the heavenly aromatic liquor I was seeking and also pricey.",

When I phoned on a hot Friday evening to book one of the tables next to massive front windows that open onto the street, I was told they were all gone and i couldn't pre-book at all. Not a great start. However the place is wonderful: 1) The food is very high quality and quite reasonably priced: Vietnameese is the best parts of Chineese, indian and thai but far more subtle and somehow prepared with more care. Lots of fish and interesting vegetables, 2) the decor is 1930s Saigon: from dark bamboo to slow turning ceiling fans which somehow works 3) The place is a little quirky:an odd mini nightclub downstairs, laminatd menus mix with fine linen tablecloths (?!) and excellent freindly staff.",

It was clear that this new menu is a current hit because when we went today its really the first time we've seen that many customers in there at lunch. Nice food (grilled pork and grilled chicken are finger licking good), friendly staff and fairly reasonable prices make this a nice venue for Vietnamese on the West side.",

    "text": "I love this place. And pho. While this place does not have the absolute best pho I've had (that's in LA... like most of my Asian food experiences...), it is pretty darn good for London. It doesn't hurt that it's not far from my house either :)The bowl of pho isn't very large, which is sad, but it's fine by London standards. I think it's just under 8 for a bowl. I usually am full after sharing a large starter and having the pho after. The broth is pretty flavorful, though there isn't as much beef as I'd like. Also, they don't have sriracha, but instead have a different chili sauce. I also always order more chili sauce and hoisin since it's never enough. The hoisin is also kind of a more bland one than I'm used to, but it'll do. The starters are more expensive (6-7) than I would think, given how reasonable the rest of the mains are, but they're not tiny so that eases the pain a bit.I've also had:- steamed rice rolls with minced pork and mushroom: douse it in fish sauce. i usually order this with my friend- spring rolls: solid, but not my first choice- duck salad: super yummy!- vermicelli bowl with spring rolls and grilled pork meatballs: lovely in summer or as an alternative to pho if you'd still like something noodley. i'd ask for the fish sauce on the side since sometimes they drown it. - stewed pork with caramel sauce in clay pot: really flavorful pork dish that's delicious with rice as it's too salty on it's own. i wish the portion was a bit bigger though.Bonus is that the staff is very attentive. The decor is nice and for London, this place is pretty good value for money.",

The restaurant decor is very nice but the staff are less than welcoming and friendly. We did not have a reservation and I felt like they were doing us a favour to allow us to have dinner and would only give us a table for 1:30 minutes. If they had any level of common sense, they would have noticed that we had two kids with us (one being very little) and it was unlikely that we would stay for more than 1:30 minutes... The food is just ok, nothing great really. The restaurant is pretty and that's the main selling point but food was average, quite greasy as someone else said and service was probably delivered by people who used to work in the army and are still to discover the concept of paying customers. Food did come out quickly and we were out in about 1 hour. I don't think we are going to go back there too soon.",

    "text": "Saigon Saigon is a large, bright Vietnamese restaurant in Ravenscourt park. Easy walk from Hammersmith or Chiswick. The decor is bright and fairly neutral. The staff were warm and welcoming.Food-wise we ordered veggie and meat spring rolls which were both excellent. The duck skewers were also flavourful. The beef in betal leaves were the biggest surprise though. Super juicy and succulent minced beef with gorgeous seasoning wrapped in leaves and served with noodles, salad, lots of fresh and dried garnishes and a beautiful dipping sauce. A really delicious dish and generous in portion size. For mains, we went for veggie vermicelli bowl, braised aubergine, prawns, peppery steak, pork belly with quails egg, morning glory, rice and plain noodles. Everything was full of flavour and again, great portion sizes. The pork was soft and melt in your mouth, the steak was succulent and peppery, the prawns were a touch over-cooked but full of flavour. Even the plain noodles were delicious!For drinks were tried the lime juice and the lime iced tea which were both delicious.For the whole meal, including service charge, we paid \u00a3130. Considering the amount of fod we had and the quality, we were really happy and had take-away boxes for the next day!I hadn't been to this restaurant in many, many years, guess it was a case of it being too local and faded into the back of my mind but it's at the front now and I can't wait to go back, they do a good value lunch menu too. It's worth mentioning that they were busy after 9pm on a Tuesday night and were still serving after 10pm so a great late night option too!",

Saigon Saigon is a place we tried accidentally...no reviews read, no recommendations by friends. Did we stumble on a gold pot or what?The menu is extensive to the extent of being spoilt for choice (read confusing). I chose a prawn starter and chickn for mains. Loved it all. The prawn especially - grilled prawn flesh on sugarcane! The whole DIY, roll your own prawn spring roll made it fun and yumm. The husband had Mackerel and Mr. Fussy-about-fish said it was the best Mackerel he had eaten in a restaurant in the longest time. Food here seems as authentic as it can get!Enjoyed our experience thoroughly. Staff is friendly and warm. Only negative would be being served regular green tea in the name of \"Vietnamese Organic Tea\". Otherwise, a must go for a first timer and must go again for someone like me.",

The food was good - not the best pho I have had (the best was in Paris).We ordered the steamed rice rolls as a starter and they were good but the pork sausage on top of the rolls scared me. It looked like bologna, so I stayed as far away from it as possible. I don't know what I was expecting but the steamed rice rolls were not what I was expecting, in any way, shape or form.I ordered the pho with beef and as stated in previous reviews, the portion size was much smaller than I was accustomed to, however, I was full after eating half of the steamed rice rolls and the entire bowl of pho. Also, the \"toppings\" for the pho were lacking. First, there was no mint. Second, there were only a few chili slices and literally six bean sprouts. So, overall, they could increase the amount of toppings but the pho was good. I'd totally order it again.My husband ordered the stir fried spicy beef with rice noodles and he said it was't that great but since this isn't his review, I'm not going to incorporate his opinion on his main! I will say that he had food envy, however.I'm excited to return to Saigon Saigon on a cold (and probably rainy) day and slurp down a delicious bowl of pho sometime in the future.",

    "text": "Summary:+ Very large restaurant with dark wooden furnishings + High ceilings and chic d\u00e9cor + Excellent food and very reasonable priceOverall: Saigon Saigon is Viet Grill of West London. Or should I say Viet Grill is Saigon Saigon of East London. This is a widely debated topic that divides the capital into left and right. No, not really. But I just find it interesting that two of the great Vietnamese restaurants are located at both ends of London. But I personally prefer Saigon Saigon. Here is why... Saigon Saigon is a gorgeous Vietnamese restaurant in West London that has the grandeur of French colonial Vietnam. Food is really good and portion is not particularly small. But they somehow keep the prices pretty reasonable. I want to know how they manage that. Wait, maybe I don't wanna know. Surrounded by the gorgeous d\u00e9cor, you can dine like a tycoon and pay like umm a buffoon??? My silly pun aside, their cost performance is amazing. I'm not Vietnamese but my Vietnamese friends speak highly of this place too. (Borrowing authority) I have only come here for dinner but I've heard their lunch is really good value for money. One day. When I have friends coming over from out of town, I try to take them to this place. I don't always succeed, as it's not very conveniently located. But when I do manage to lure them out here, people always enjoy the food and dining experience.",

    "text": "Gooooodmorning Vietnam was yelled on the air by R. Williams , and Hello Saigon Saigon should be yelled by us all! In my opinion this place is just that good! Lets get some, imho, less important things out of the way before I attest for what is really important, that being the food! The Saigon Saigon is a nicely decorated, well designed and spacious place yielding to a great ambiance that together with prompt, professional, friendly and capable service ensures your dinning experience to be nothing but good. Now lets move on to what makes the entire experience great which is the food. \u00a0I am not a fan of Pho, but this is the place for you Pho lovers as I find the broth to be the best I had outside Vietnam. You still get the chance to flavor your Pho according to your taste but right out of the kitchen it is great.Don't get me wrong, I do love fried things, but at Saigon Saigon the freshly made, wraps or rolls in rice papers are the way to go, however the well balanced sourness of the Grilled tumeric white fish makes it another worthy contender. \u00a0Lotus root salad with prawn and beef is another starter I would highly recommend. But if you looking to share why not try a meal really for two and get the char grilled prawn meat wrapped on sugar cane, juicy and aromatic.Seriously well balanced, well seasoned, slightly sweetened by coconut beef on fire is what will make you come back to this place again and again and again. But when and if you ever get tired of it you can always rely on duck breast with pineapple & green pepper in tamarind sauce or Sweet & sour battered snapper with green peppers.In regards of noodles I found the fried ones be less great but this is only due the fact that they go somewhat soggy laying in the sauces at the end. But don't worry \u00a0portion-wise the size is great so getting to the end of your plate will take some time and usually you are full by then. The fat rice noodle dishes are my all time favorites, there is just something heavenly with fat noodles and at Saigon Saigon they are cooked to perfection and al dente. Dinner for two, with this level of quality and taste, anywhere between 40 to 60 depending on what you choose as to drink including the service charge of 12.5% is in my book a find. And considering the fact that I haven't even yet mention the generous, tasty and playful Steamboats, or as some call it Vietnamese fondue, for around \u00a320 to gather around and enjoy as couples makes it hard not to say hello to Saigon Saigon again and gain and again!",

It reminded me of my mom's, which made me miss home cooking. The bun bo hue was decent, but really small. That bowl cost about $15, so it definitely wasn't worth the price to me. That small bowl was probably smaller than a small bowl here in the states, which is super small. But everything in the UK was smaller portions, so I guess I can't really complain.Other than pricing and portion of food being a disadvantage for me, everything else was great.
