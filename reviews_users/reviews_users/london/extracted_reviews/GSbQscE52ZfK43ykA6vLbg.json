    "text": "Great afternoon tea. The high tea and selection of tea leaves available is unrivalled in London.I didn't really want a big meal, so just wanted a pot of tea and a cake, but this isn't strictly possible, which is a let down. I think you have to go downstairs for that sort of thing.Anyway, I got a savoury dish (asparagus and a poached duck egg) which was amazing!!! It didn't say on the menu but it comes with truffles and truffle oil. It tasted out of this world!! My friend had a Welsh rarebit which was tasty too.After that I got a cake, a slice of the Bakewell tart. An issue at Fortnum's is that they do not give the best descriptions (such as omitting the truffles from the asparagus and egg). The Bakewell tart was an orangey thing, without jam. It was tasty, but not what I expected. Perhaps ask the waiting staff (who are very helpful, I had a nice chat with one of them in Spanish for a while) for a comprehensive description could aid your choice. My friend had the extremely rich chocolate cake which was great, not too sweet or bitter, perfect balance. It gets a bit too much towards the end.NB: although I'm not sure there is an enforced dress code, it is relatively smart, and therefore be more smart than casual when it comes to 'smart casual'.Enjoy",

Of course I have to try the real one in England. This place didn't let me down. It is amazing. The sandwiches are tasty. The scones are the best I have ever had. The apricot jam and lemon curd are delicious. They came in jars. They packed them up for me before we left. It is pricey and fancy but it's all you can eat. They will refill whatever you'd like which is awesome. This is definitely the top one place when it comes to the tea service for me. I would like to come back next time when I visit London!",

Servers were nice but not very attentive - we had to flag ours down to get more hot water for our tea and no one cleared any of our dirty plates nor offered new ones.

The sandwiches were a delight, as were the scones. I had strawberry black tea and my sister had apple green tea. Both were light and perfect for late afternoon caffeine fix. I only took off a star because I couldn't justify the price tag that came with this expensive tea experience, but everything (from decor to atmosphere to service to food) was perfect.

The decor was beautiful and the location ideal, as it was within walking distance to St James's park. They sat us and then we waited. Probably at least 20 minutes before we got a menu. We ordered the afternoon tea for 4 and standard \u00a0cups of tea. It was a full 25-30 minutes before we got any tea and that was only because the head waiter, I believe, finally asked us if we had ordered. It was quite a long time before the food came. The waitress informed us that we could obtain more of any part of the meal by just informing our waiter. I have to say, the food was pretty good. But paltry. We wanted to ask for more sandwiches but found it difficult as no one came to our table for over a 30-40 minutes. My hubby finally had to wave down the head waiter from across the restaurant again. Eventually got another bit, but by then we were soured. My son who was celebrating his 16th birthday would have loved more tea but even after 2 1/2 hours, there was no waiter to refill his water. After eating, we waited for more than another half hour to get a check. No waiters at any point to see how we were doing. Only at the very end to have us pay our check. We've had better, and more gracious high tea in California. Given that after tip, it was more than L180.00, I would have expected better service. Over 3 hours and only once did a waiter come to our table to give us our food. I don't know if there was a mix up on servers or perhaps they decided it wasn't worth expending good service on tourists. Won't be back on our next visit.",

    "text": "Quick summary: expensive but doesn't live up to expectation. There are better places than Fortnum and Mason, e.g. The Wolseley. Come here only if you are crazy about the name like we used to. (We really loved it because of a childhood show All Creatures Great and Small)We paid \u00a3108 for slow service, unfriendly staff, poor quality sweets, cold tea, and forgotten tableFull story: My boyfriend and I were so excited about having a full and proper English afternoon tea in one of the most prestigious places in London - Fortnum and Mason. We looked up reviews online, we knew the price and such, we even went to the store the day before to check it out. We adore the shopping floors, especially the meat section. The staff there was so nice and explained different types of jerkeys with details. We ended up buying 800kg of all three types of jerkeys. Back to the afternoon tea. When we arrived, the front desk lady kindly explained the pricing and different sets of afternoon teas and high tea options. Afterwards, she showed us our table and let our server take over. We decided to have the sweet afternoon tea (\u00a344) and the high tea (46\u00a3) which includes a main dish and savory scones and little snacks. The first round was great - we loved the main dish: Venison Wellington and the sandwiches were good as expected. However, everything turned down hill after the main dish. Our plates were emptied for a good 15mins but our server absolutely forgot about us. We asked two waiters to take away our empty plates and asked them twice for our tower of snacks and scones. We waited for 30mins until we have the two towers. It was quite busy that day but for that price and reputation we expected them to do better. Our towers finally arrived after 30mins. We loved the savory tower and the truffle puff was the best. But we were very disappointed about the sweet snacks. We didn't like anything on that plate. The flavor of the food can be very subjective since we all have different taste. However, the biggest turn off was the service. Our teas were cold, so we asked for a hot water refill. Again, we asked them three times until one lady answers us impolitely by saying \"unhuh, unhuh\". At this time, we were very upset about the experience. Our server totally forgot about our existence, other servers were unfriendly and unwillingly to offer help. The water came lukewarm - closer to room temperature. My boyfriend and I are tea drinkers and we tried different tea experience around the world. We have never encountered such unpleasant experience from a well respected tea place like Fortnum and Mason. In the end, we asked the staff to pack the sandwiches and scones. The server replied with a poker face: we don't pack sandwiches. And left with the remaining food without further explanation. We found out it's due to food safety reasons that we can't have the sandwiches as take away. But we only find out about it by asking the front desk. It also took us another 20mins and two waiters to get the bill. When the waiter came with the bill, we finally saw the first smile on his face :) This has ruined all the great impression we had before about Fortnum and Mason. Extremely disappointed. We paid \u00a3108 for slow service, unfriendly staff, poor quality sweets, cold tea, and forgotten table.",

Our waitress wasn't very pleasant, very brief - didn't ask if we had been there before or if we needed help selecting which afternoon tea we wanted or explaining the teas, not sure if it was something we did or if that is just how the service is. She kept checking my husband's level of tea which he was not drinking as fast because believe it or not we were not there for his benefit, so I went without tea for longer than I would have liked but waited patiently. She also didn't explain which sandwiches and tea cakes we received. It was very loud in the tea area both from the serving area where the teas are prepared and just generally loud groups around so not the tranquil, elegant experience I was hoping to have. In fact we could barely hear the piano over the noise level in the room. The scones were the best part in my opinion, husband liked the salmon sandwich. We enjoyed shopping downstairs and buying gifts to bring home but overall wish we would have selected another venue for our afternoon tea.",

    "text": "The one thing the GF wanted to do in London was enjoy afternoon tea. So we decided to head to Fortnum & Mason's Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon after spending the day at Buckingham Palace.Fortnum & Mason is a huge department store located in London. They've obviously got everything you need for a proper tea, including a myriad of loose tea offerings for purchase. With respect to food, they've got specialty charcuterie, produce, and cheese as well.Located on the top floor, you'll find a pianist on the grand piano. And to your right, the tea salon beckons, ready to help you feel at home for the next few hours. Afternoon Tea [40 Pounds pp = \u00a0$65.56 pp]Afternoon tea is more than just the tea. It's about some pomp, along with some finger sandwiches and desserts to be enjoyed. From an entire menu of options, each person gets to select their own tea. Not to be crass, but did I mention unlimited refills? On everything.My green tea wasn't overpowering with ginger essence, but was lightly refreshing. We appreciated the tiny cubes of dried apple that imparted their essence into the GF's tea.But let's be real. I was here for the food. A tower of pastries, scones, and finger sandwiches came out. Along with clotted cream, strawberry, and lemon jams. The airiness of the rich clotted cream could not be denied.The raisin scones were like sweet biscuits, with a hard exterior that lent way to a fluffy interior. Perfect to pair with the lemon and strawberry jams.The sandwiches were sans crust and soft. Not much texture (even with the cucumber), but they were still enjoyable and classic. The cucumber sandwich was light, the salmon was smoky, and the egg salad was nicely seasoned with pepper. The roast beef was very good, but my favorite was the chicken and corn, which was well-seasoned and had sweet notes from the corn.I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but how could these tasty treats be denied? Eclairs, chocolate ganaches, cream puffs, and macarons. On top of that, don't hesitate to ask for goodies from the dessert trolley. We decided to try both the chocolate cake and raspberry lady finger cakes. The raspberry cake was moist and studded with cream, raspberries, and walnuts. The chocolate cake was extremely decadent - essentially a molded ganache. If you're a fan of chocolate, this is heaven.Service was very good as well - relaxed, well-paced, and proper without being pretentious. Some may poo at afternoon tea for those visiting London. But I say if you're looking to relax while enjoying some light fare and plenty of sweets, there's no reason you shouldn't consider spending your afternoon at Fortnum & Mason's Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon.",

If you're going to have afternoon tea in England, you might as well have the best.The Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon atop Fortnum and Mason is hands down the best afternoon tea I've ever had (and I've had it in several different countries). I would go as far as to say that this should be in the top ten list of things you have planned for London, nay England.Things to know:- Call and make a reservation. Do not show up.- Dress casual but presentable. I wore a T-Shirt, jeans and sneakers but made sure none of it had stains or holes. I was still the most underdressed diner but they passed no judgement.- The steep price is worth it, especially when you factor in the refills on everything.Unlike many other tea rooms in the world where I felt judged for having afternoon tea by myself, the wait staff at the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon made me comfortable. They were very attentive and returned to make sure my pot and my plate were full. They checked on me regularly to ask if I wanted to have seconds of anything (I did -- savory finger sandwiches) and made a good tea recommendation based on my preferences.Whenever I hear someone is visiting London, this the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon is the first place I recommend.",

The atmosphere was lovely, with robins egg blue accents, as was (most of) the food (smoked salmon sandwich was too dry, cake cart chocolate cake was overly dense, highlights were the coronation chicken, mini chocolate cake, and of course the tea), but the service was pretty poor. About half way through the tea, our server disappeared, never to be seen again. From then on, we had random waiters helping us after we waived them down. The woman next to us arrived after the server left, and waited about 20 minutes until someone took her order. When we did have service, it was very polite and responsive, but we had to flag down staff, which was less than ideal. Don't know if we got a bum waiter or what, but it certainly could have been better.",

As one would think, the tea is their forte, the selection is long and the waiters can help you decide depending on your taste. I kept it simple with the house blend and it was very nice.At the end the waiter came around with a slice of Victoria sponge with berries that was scrumptious! If I had to criticize anything, it would be the evident chips and scratches in the china and cutlery, other than that perfect.",

    "text": "We were so delighted to bring our children for a proper tea at Fortnum and Mason. It was an incredible meal and a highlight of our trip. The food was incredible (we liked things we usually don't like), the sweets were gorgeous and delicious, and the tea, extraordinary. The best part is the traditional scones, clotted cream and jam. We'd be happy just having those with tea, quite honestly. Our servers were professional, courteous and warm. As other reviewers have said, you MUST get the chocolate cake from the sweets table. It is one of the best you will ever have in your life. While there were many people in the rooms, we felt like we were the only people there and the piano music in the distance was calm and classy.I took off one star for:* Our table wasn't ready on time. While it was Good Friday and extremely busy, we arrived hungry and waited nearly 15 minutes for our reserved table to be ready.* My younger child was handed a child's menu without asking. While her age is appropriate for normal pizza and macaroni & cheese eating kids, it's not the case with this one and she continually feels put down by not being offered the adult menu. \u00a0She ended up ordered the vegetarian tea and loving it.* There's simply too much food. My husband and I shared a single tray and we were stuffed. One wants to get the most for the price but even splitting the four of us couldn't finish a tiny piece of chocolate cake from the dessert table. I'm a baker and I longed to try the raspberry coconut cake and the pear tart. \u00a0I saw piles upon piles of food leaving tables that people couldn't or didn't want to finish. It seems like a terrible waste. These are minor points in the overall experience we had. That was our last night in London and a wonderful way to end our trip. Go, go, go!!",

    "text": "TL;DR: It gets two stars for the delicious food and tea, but the service was absolutely awful.Dining at Fortnum & Mason's was one of the things to which I was looking forward the most on my first trip to London. I wanted to have a truly British tea and made reservations for my husband and me for 5:00 PM on 18 March several months in advance. When we arrived at the salon, we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. This was not an issue, and we were fine to wait in the reception. When we were seated, no one approached us for a few minutes until a man brought over a pitcher of water to fill our glasses. We assumed he was a busboy at first as he never introduced himself, and it wasn't until he asked if we'd made any decisions on the menu or had any questions that we realized he would be our waiter. He was not particularly helpful in advising me on teas, which I found disappointing as I was planning to ask for suggestions since I am a relative neophyte. (I drink some tea at home but not significant amounts.) My husband and I ordered the high tea and savory afternoon tea with our first two pots, and everything seemed to go well for a while. I'm unsure whether we did something offensive during the service (though we could think of nothing), but our server practically ignored us throughout the entire meal. I sat with an empty water glass for 40 minutes, and though I saw him refilling cups around us, he ignored my table and seemed to forget we were there. We managed to flag him down after being out of tea for approximately 15 minutes and requested the new pots he had said we could have. It took a significant amount of time to receive them, and when they finally did come, we decided to put in our cake order since we weren't sure when we'd see him again. He tried to clear my plate, which still had food on it, without asking whether I had finished, and when I protested, he said he couldn't bring the cake until I'd finished the savory items. I completed the course shortly after he left, and we waited for 30 minutes for the cake we had ordered to arrive. It never did.At this point we had been in the restaurant 2 hours though I had been told through e-mail to expect the service to last only 1.5. I excused myself to the facilities, and when I returned, my husband told me he had finally managed to grab the attention of another server, who sent our waiter to the table. Apparently he had completely forgotten about us and our order, which led me to wonder what we thought we were doing for 30 minutes with nothing but dirty dishes on our table. He ended up packing the cakes up for us to take home since we had been there such a long time and were frankly ready to be gone after being ignored for hours. I was incredibly disappointed with the whole episode and left the salon truly upset about the way we had been treated. I didn't speak to management then because I was so shocked at the abysmal service after reading nothing but glowing reviews and anticipating this visit for months. I wrote to the restaurant at the reservation link and was told that the restaurant manager would respond within 72 hours; it's been 9 days now so I'm not holding my breath for a response.This was not what I expected from such a well-respected establishment. I would never return again (despite the amazing food and drink); what was supposed to be a highlight of my trip ended up being nothing more than an expensive, disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Before my trip to London, I went all out crazy looking for the best place for afternoon tea. With so many choices in the city and a range of prices from \u00a320 to \u00a360 or more per person, it was hard to pick one, but we ultimately settled for this one. We were skeptical and had high expectations due to the price - \u00a340pp for the regular Afternoon tea with one of the classic tea blends. This is our first time at one of these places so we didn't quite know what to expect. Our waiter was quite helpful at guiding, explaining about the menu and answering all our questions.1. Your table is guaranteed for 90 mins. We stayed for almost 2 hours though because we started at 530pm and I think it ends at 7pm. Plus it was not overly packed on the Friday that we went.2. Everyone at your table can order different sets. ie) You can have the regular afternoon tea while someone else can order the savory afternoon tea. 3. Each plate level is replenishable. You just have to ask. It isn't advertised.4. You can have as many pots of tea as you want. If you didn't finish a pot and it turns cold, just ask and they will give you another. If you want to try a different tea blend, you can as well. It's unlimited. 5. At the end, you can also have some cakes/pies from the cake carriage. We tried the raspberry cake and it was absolutely divine.6. If you didn't finish something and you want to take it home, they can box it up for you. That includes the cakes at the end even if you didn't get a chance to eat them because you are too full. That's what we did. However, we couldn't box up our finger sandwiches due to a food regulation according to our waiter. Now on to our teas and food. I picked the Countess Grey blend and my bf picked the Queen Anne Blend. Both were very good but I really LOVED the Countess Grey. The light orange flavor you taste was very pleasant. All of the finger sandwiches were tasty and fresh. The scones were great as well as the clotted cream, raspberry jam and the lemon curd. Some of the sweets were too sweet for our liking like the eclair, but the others were delicious. It was a bit pricey, but it was a fantastic, classy experience overall and something everyone should try at least once in their lifetime.",

You can also order more of anything you want for your menu! We opted for the savory afternoon tea. The chicken finger sandwiches were delish, the savory scones were good but very heavy and dense. Stilton cheese was a main component of one. If you enjoy cheese stink, then this one is for you. We also enjoyed the foie gras eclair, salmon bini with caviar, and game terrine were our favorites.",

    "text": "On our trip to London, I had to try a traditional Afternoon Tea. \u00a0After much research, I decided to go with a classic - Fortnum and Mason. \u00a0I had no idea it was an actual sort of department store. \u00a0The main floor was of course, tea. \u00a0I bought Earl Gray for myself (the best Earl Gray tea I have ever had) and green tea in a special Fortnum container. \u00a0The other floors had clothing and accessories, but we went up to the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon, which was opened by Her Majesty. \u00a0Ohh la la! \u00a0They have a High Tea, Champagne Tea, Traditional Afternoon Tea, Savory Afternoon Tea, and Vegetarian Tea. \u00a0We did one Traditional and one Savory, which is 46 pounds per person or 50 pounds if you pick a rare tea. \u00a0I got the Moroccan Mint tea, which was very refreshing. Some of the highlights of our tiered tea towers were the Coronation Turkey and Fortnum's Smoke Salmon finger sandwiches, the wild mushroom puff with truffle, and parfait of goose foie gras eclair with port glaze. \u00a0But the best thing, was the scones with clotted cream and jam. \u00a0Omg. \u00a0They needed to be taken away from me. \u00a0I definitely liked the Savory tea better, as the desserts were a bit too sweet and we couldn't even get ourselves to try anything from the cake carriage, which is basically a table of cakes you can grab as much as you want from. \u00a0Did I note they will refill your food with any specific items you like?? Heaven! If you want to try a classic English Afternoon Tea, definitely check out Fortnum's and plan to stay for at least and hour and a half to 2 hours to fully enjoy!",

Our server was very accommodating of our American ways and graciously led us through the menu choices and the tea selection. We all tried different types of tea and had fun going downstairs to the food hall after tea and buying some to take home. They generously refilled our tiered trays multiple times so everyone could try everything. We were pretty stuffed when it came time for the cake trolley, so they made us a beautiful to-go box of cake samples which we enjoyed in our room later that evening. Definitely recommend.",

The setting was extremely nice, service was impeccable, and the tea and food selections were all great.

The piano player was great, and the whole experience was very pleasant and relaxed.",

My friend and I had reservations, and after a short wait in the reception area, we were seated near the cake carriage.The service was adequate, though I must say it could have been friendlier. We were there for the full afternoon tea service and our server was a bit cold and abrupt, if not outright rude. The tea was fantastic, as I expected. The scones and clotted cream were fresh, and we were presented with two jars of jam and lemon curd. The sandwiches were good and plentiful.The server at the cake carriage was much better, and I particularly liked the Battenberg cake. It was fresh out of their bakery and was quite good: moist and not too sweet. It was not a busy afternoon and we were able to take our time in the salon. It was mostly a pleasant experience and I'll give them another try when I'm back in London this summer.",

I was really excited to find a high tea place that offered an entire selection of gluten free items for my husband. I wish more places were like this! I was so pleased he got to try the same finger sandwiches but on gluten free bread. He also had scones and little desserts and said the iced tea was the best he ever had. It is expensive when compared to other high tea places but TOTALLY worth it in my opinion, considering the quality of food and that you can get any of your food trays refilled at any time. We also liked that formal dress including jacket and tie for men were not required. Service was excellent and we definitely left feeling full and satisfied. I highly highly recommend if you want for full high tea experience.",

    "text": "Such a tourist move, but how could you go to London and not have afternoon tea?! Having done extensive research, the Diamond Jubliee Tea Salon at Fortnum and Mason stood out to me as they had an extensive tea selection list. We opted to share the savory afternoon tea menu as it was pretty much the same as the sweet, except you get an extra tier of savory elements for 4 pounds extra. The scones are also savory instead. A little frightened and overwhelmed with the selections of tea, we asked our waitress for her recommendations. In the end we went with the Jubliee and the Royal Blend as she claimed those two were the most popular. Unfortunately, my boyfriend had the stomach virus, but didn't want to cancel our reservations / wanted me to still have the tea experience for our last day in London, so he wasn't able to eat much, but he drank plenty of tea. I pretty much ate the entire 3 tiers, which wasn't a problem because everything was absolutely delicious! My favorites were the curry chicken sandwich and the scones with the savory spread. The scones were SOO good - they're tiny, but very dense, but so addicting. If I wasn't stuffed, I would have asked for a refill on the scones, when I asked for a refill on the curry chicken sandwiches. Tip - if you're refilling food, I would just refill all your tiers because they box up your leftovers and allow you to take them home! Oh and if you think you're full and can't handle any more food, you'll totally forget that you had that thought when they offer to show you their table of desserts. I told myself I'll just look and just have a small slice of whatever stood out to me the most. BUT then I got to the table and EVERYTHING looked good, so I asked for a small slice of each (there were 5 cakes, so I had 5 small slices); talk about self control right? My favorite two cakes were the two cakes that were specifically known in London. They were so elaborate and colorful and looked really sweet, but once you have a bite, they're so moist and buttery and not very sweet at all! More of a coffee lover, I wasn't expecting too much from the teas, but the Jubliee and the Royal Blend were so good that we both finished our pots, refilled the Jubliee as we preferred that more AND then ordered a pot of the Earl Grey (which we then loved more than the Jubliee and refilled too)! Seriously, their teas are THAT amazing that after our afternoon tea, we went downstairs and bought an insane amount of tins of tea to bring home for ourselves and friends. OH and my boyfriend and I swear that their tea has healing powers because he instantly felt better and was cured of his sickness after our 2 hours dining here. Afternoon tea, especially at the Diamond Jubliee Tea Salon at Fortnum and Mason is a must!!",

    "text": "What a fantastic afternoon tea experience. \u00a0From the service to the food to the atmosphere of the salon, there was nothing more I could ask for except more stomach room.We arrived a bit early, and waited on couches in the lobby area before being escorted to our table. \u00a0Having done our research beforehand, one of us ordered the afternoon tea and the other the savory tea. \u00a0As for the tea, I opted for the Jubilee tea blend (normally I'm not a fan of black but the description was intriguing) and my brother listened to the server's recommendation and ordered a rose-flavored tea. \u00a0Needless to say, good decisions all around! \u00a0We loved our respective teas, and got two pots of refills each. \u00a0As for the food, the sandwiches are deceptively filling, and I was quite stuffed by the time I moved on from the scones to my dessert platter. \u00a0It looked almost too pretty to eat, the key word being almost. \u00a0I was the biggest fan of the cucumber and chicken salad sandwiches, the majority of the savory plate, and the lemon and chocolate flavored desserts on top of the afternoon tea tier. \u00a0The scones were a bit dry, requiring much clotted cream and jam. \u00a0I felt like I couldn't eat another mouthful, but my brother tried the black and white cake and said he was a fan.After we ate, we lingered over our pots of tea for a while before deciding we had digested enough and were ready to go. \u00a0Throughout our meal, our server was unfailingly friendly and helpful, and there were enough people walking around to attract someone's attention about a refill. \u00a0Watching them prepare the tea at the bar in the back was also quite fascinating.Obviously, it was extremely pricey, and you are expected to dress nicely, but what the heck. \u00a0You only live to try afternoon tea in London once.",

The little desserts were very good. I suggest better explanation of the tea varieties and offer recommendations to your guests.",

The shop itself is quite splendid, and the Christmas decorations are so very beautiful that I kept stopping to look at the trees. High tea is nowhere near as good though. The sandwiches were forgettable and the scones were some of the worst I've ever had. Even the jam could not redeem them, and they only had scones with raisins in it, no plain ones available for those of us who don't like raisins. The tea was also just average. I was really not impressed at all by the high tea. You would think such a fancy place would have high quality food, but they don't. I have had high tea at other places that are not as famous, and it was much much better. Even the high tea at Harrods, which was not really amazing, was still miles above this. The high tea at Sketch is much better as well, and the best I've had was in a little French place in Montreal that may not be famous, but is a thousand times better than any of these.I would say skip the high tea, save your money, and get a pretty tin of biscuits from here, which ARE actually high quality and yummy.",

    "text": "Thanks to my English coworker who recommended this beautiful and elegant tea salon in Picadilly, London!!! The 1st floor is the store where they sell teas,jams,sweets, etc. The 2nd floor is the restaurant. The 3rd floor is the tea salon, which was adorned with Tiffany colored drapes, table mats, even the servers' shirts! Although we've experienced tea rooms in LA, we had to try tea in London!! And it was pretty expensive lol. We couldn't share so we both ordered $60/ea the UNLIMITED AYCE tea/finger sandwiches/pastries.The server started us off with 4 tea tastings of our choice. We tried the white tea from China, Darjeeling tea from India, black tea from India, and the lotus tea from China. I chose the Darjeeling and my BF the black. Both were very smooth rich and fragrant. Btw, the tea pot/tea set was quite cute and lovely! We started off with 4 finger sandwiches. Actually I had the yummy sandwiches to myself bc my bf doesn't care for sandwiches at all.Cucumber and mayoSmoked salmon and spicy chipotle sauce Curry chicken Beef carpaccio and mayoTasty!! Next came the smooth soft warm and flaky scones, served with their very own raspberry and marmalade jams. These were the BEST scones/jams we've ever had!!! Then came the pastries OMG! Strawberry eclair with ros\u00e9 petalsPassion fruit macaronsBrownie bites with gold-chocolate flakesCream puffsHazelnut cakeThese were all to die for!!! I kid you not, we asked for more tea, finger sandwiches, and pastries... and left with some more scones and pastries lol! We are definitely coming back to this tea salon on our next euro trip !! Until next time!!",

    "text": "Not having another afternoon tea experience to compare this to, I'm sticking with three stars. This was our first English formal afternoon tea experience. We originally had our sights set on The Ritz, but by the time got around to making plans, they were full. This place was recommended by our hotel concierge. The Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon is on the 4th floor of Fortnum and Mason, which according to my wife is a very famous shop. I had never heard of them, but I don't pay much attention to these things. It was what we expected from English tea, copious amounts of food served on three-tiered trays. The sandwiches were nice, if a bit bland. For me the scones were the best of the food, and the best I ever had. You have the option for endless refills of the trays if you choose. You can also switch out your tea for any of the dozens of selections. Having never done this and not being a big fan of tea, I would have liked someone to give recommendations of teas according to our level of experience. We were not offered this though, and the staff did not provide this even when asked for recommendations.Overall we found it difficult to capture the staff's attention. I understand that it is a struggle to find the balance between letting a couple enjoy their afternoon by giving distance, but there were times we felt on the border of ignored. I had to flag one of them down to ask to change out my tea as we were never offered this. They did bring another plate of sandwiches, but never did bring by the cake trolley even though we said we were interested when they offered. In spite of the failures of the staff, the overall experience was nice. The room is light and airy with bright pastel colors and many windows. We live in the pub-dominated English countryside, so we found this bright room to be very refreshing. \u00a0The live piano player also added to the nice atmosphere of the room. Still, I'm not sure we will return for Fortnum and Mason when we come back for more tea in London.The amount of food makes this a reasonable value, but since the more reputable and formal tea rooms are around the same price with similar offerings, I think there are better places to go.",

    "text": "I love afternoon tea, and this is by far the best place I've experienced it at. The setting is beautiful, and I'm glad I dressed up a bit for it. We were seated at a table along the back of the room within view of a nice big window with plenty of natural light. We were brought menus, including tea menus, which are VERY LONG! There was a lot to choose from, so I ended up picking a unique one that is actually grown in England, and it was very nice.There are 3 different afternoon teas to choose from. The 2 afternoon teas come with your typical 3-tier tray with sandwiches on the bottom, scones in the middle, and tiny desserts on top. There are also cakes available after you're finished. (I guess they just can't fit it all on one tray very easily.) High tea differs in that you begin with a hot entr\u00e9e like an omelet, welsh rabbit, eggs benedict, etc. Then you also get the scones and cakes. There's a variety of different champagne that you can complement your afternoon tea with, ranging in price from a \u00a310 glass to \u00a0\u00a3150 bottle!Here's a summary of the 3 afternoon tea options: Afternoon tea: finger sandwiches(Cucumber, Coronation Chicken, Ham and Cheese, egg salad, Smoked Salmon), scones with clotted cream and your choice of 2 preserves, Individual cakes and patisseries followed by \"a selection from the Coronation Cake Carriage\" if you've got room. \u00a340-\u00a344 per person depending on which tea you choose. Savory afternoon tea: same finger sandwiches, savory scones, savory tartlets/blini/Mille Feuilles, etc. Also comes with cakes at the end. \u00a342-\u00a346 per person depending on which tea you choose. High tea. Choice of savory dish, scones with clotted cream and preserves, \u00a0individual cakes and patisseries, then cake if you can fit it! \u00a344-\u00a348 per person depending on which tea you choose. We went with the classic afternoon tea, and chose raspberry jam and lemon curd to go with our scones. The scones were amazing: by far the best I've had at anywhere in London or the US: warm, flaky, and not-too-sweet, perfect for slathering clotted cream and lemon curd on. The finger sandwiches were all served on different breads and used top-notch ingredients. I really enjoyed the coronation chicken and the smoked salmon. The desserts on the top were good, but there was a rose \u00e9clair which I thought was cloyingly sweet. After we finished with all of that, we asked for a slice of lemon cake, which was delicious but I was very full by that point, so I didn't have much. I'm not sure how people manage the \"high tea\"!Our afternoon tea tray came out quickly, while the tables around us were doing the high tea and the hot dishes seem to have taken quite some time. I didn't feel like our food had been sitting out at all, though - I have definitely had tea at places before where the tray of food has been sitting out or refrigerated so everything is the same temperature and the scones aren't even warm. That's just sad. I was glad that F&M gave us piping hot scones, that really makes it!The only slightly odd aspect of the experience was when a waiter stopped by to bring our tray of tiny sandwiches, scones and desserts, and told us \"If you manage to eat all of that, we'll bring you some cakes as well\", as if it were some kind of all-you-can-eat buffet challenge! I will definitely come back for tea here again. I recommend wandering around the many floors of the store after you're done, as well - there's lots to explore.EDIT! After reading a few other reviews, I just want to say: there were definitely no raisins in my scones (YUCK), they were just plain, and awesome. Also, I didn't realize that you could switch out your tea for pretty much any other one you wanted to try! I should have done that.. Next time I think I'm skipping breakfast and dinner :)",

Honestly, it was like a dream being able to have a high tea in London - we felt like royalty. Don't come with a full belly, because you will certainly leave with one! One of my family members is gluten free, and we were thrilled when making a reservation, that they offered a gluten free option. *I would highly recommend making a reservation because you don't want to wait or risk not getting a table when you see the tea trays being brought out!* I was really pleased with the selection of teas - they had an entire book with over 20 different tea choices! Also, the sandwiches were absolutely delicious, from salmon and cream cheese to roast beef. Another great thing about Fortnum and Mason's high tea was that they had 3 different food options. I got to try them all which were all really scrumptious! Another awesome thing was that there are free refills for everything!The food was presented impeccably, was delicious, and overall the afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason was certainly one to write home about! Make sure to bring your camera and a ready appetite!",

The finger sandwiches were a delighful array of salmon , cucumber chicken and corn , and roast beef . Those that ordered main courses such as the lobster and eggs , or eggs Benedict were equally happyThe second course of scones ., either savory or sweet were delightful and what can beat a good clotted cream .The pastries were light and delicate ranging from tasty macaroons to a rose eclair and other treats. The teas were all wonderful.To top off the experience we can't say enough about the wonderful wait staff. \u00a0Attentive when necessary but not intrusive . The ma\u00eetre de miles was amazing . Full of wonderfull advice and knowledge about tea. He went the extra mile. Would recommend this to anyone for a lovely experience!!",

And she kept offering me more scones, cakes from the jubilee cake trolley, more tea, more whatever. \u00a0Like I said, it was a copious amount of food! \u00a0Which I think is important, given the exorbitant cost. \u00a0But for a once in a blue moon special day, it is definitely worth it.",

Found out College Friend 1 was going to be in London for work at the same time as me and was meeting up with College Friend 2 who was finishing up her Master's degree in London. I crashed their afternoon tea plans at Fortnum and Mason. Love that their afternoon teas are refreshable (otherwise known as all you care to eat)! You can even pack the remaining items you can't finish to take home, including the jars of jam. Due to our size, we were able to choose from both the savory and sweet afternoon tea menus. It was great, as we balanced the sugary desserts and scones with finger sandwiches and savory small bites. What made our experience, other than the wonderful company from friends, was the pianist, Angus. He played for a couple of hours while we were there and he played beautifully. He played classic piano pieces as well as more modern tracks. We were able to request certain ones (I See the Light from Tangled) and were amazed when we played our favorites at random - Yiruma's River Flows in You for me and Charlie Puth's See You Again for BF. We stayed for 4 hours - mostly to hear Angus play (and yes, he took breaks too, so we sat through two of his playing shifts)!A hefty price tag at \u00a351 per person, but worth every \u00a3!",

There is candy in the store as well for all you candy lovers out there but I was just more focused on other things. I wish a Fortnum & Mason's would open in Minneapolis.

    "text": "5 stars for the tea. 5 stars for the tea tasting with the sommelier. 4 stars for the environment. Very nice and elegant but not as Grand as some high tea services in hotels for example. 4 stars for the service. Friendly but slow. 2 stars for the food. You can get all you can eat but I didn't want to eat much of it. The food was a heavy handed assault on the palate. The sweets were way too sweet. The savory was way too salty and the rich to heavy. We ordered the savory and standard tea service. The only thing on both menus I thought was good was the plain scone with lemon curd. And I have had better scones at cafes. How sad is that. It's worth going for the experience of getting tea and the tea itself is really good but the food is forgettable.",

There are multiple floors with clothing, accessories, tea and sweets but we went straight up to the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon! We walked in without a reservation on a Sunday during peak afternoon tea hours and they were able to get us a table. Myself and 3 of my girlfriends had the cutest, fanciest tea ever. Our server was so adorable! He was very sweet, proper and super attentive. Everyone we spoke to was very kind and extremely helpful. I chose a Famous Blend and went with \"Wedding Breakfast\" - it was delightful. My favorite mini sandwiches were the chicken and the egg salad. The sun dried tomato scone was really good as well. You can revisit any items as much as you like with the sweets and savories in the classic afternoon tea and even take things to go. If you're hungry don't be afraid you will be satisfied! The desserts, ohhh they were fantastic! Random: The bathrooms are so cute and the hand lotion in there was so amazing. I need to track it down for my own home.Overall, it was a marvelous experience, it was honestly perfect- better than I expected. I highly recommend afternoon tea at F&M when you're in London, it is a must! The experience is unforgettable.",

The ambiance felt appropriately aristocratic: well-dressed staff, live piano playing in the background, and fine china and silverware. As you would expect, they have an extensive tea menu, with rare and conventional teas, including black, oolong, yellow, green, and white teas. I had two different black teas (you can select up to 2 teas during your visit). Both were excellent. The food was great as well. Had sandwich bites and an assortment of other finger foods, both savory and sweet. You can also revisit items as many times as you wish. Our waiter was fantastic, patient and provided good recommendations. Tip: if you can, get here at around noon when it's not crowded. At around 1 pm, it gets very hectic. Before arriving at the salon(which is on the 4th floor), take some time to browse the opulent shops on the floors below.",

    "text": "Short and sweet: the service was appalling, the sandwiches bland and stale, the rest was mediocre, the tea itself was nice... when it was finally re-filled. For these prices i expected something at least slightly better than average, but this was nothing short of a waste of good money. Then they had the nerve to charge an \u00a311 service fee, for what?! Our waiter ignored us the entire damn time!Long version: My wife and i were excited to top off a big day out in London with a spot of high tea and spoil ourselves after what was one of the best days of our trip thus far.We arrived ten minutes early for a 6:15 reservation, just to be sure, and were told that they were just waiting for tables to become available (fair enough). We were seated at around 6:40, but didnt mind the wait too much; although a smile, rather than a large sigh, from the front desk would've been a bit more welcoming.We waited a little longer after having gone through the menu ourselves when our first waiter turned up, apologised for the wait and gave us his full attention. He was kind and couteous, he directed us through the menu, took our order and poured some water to drink.The setting was formal but unpretentious, which i liked, what bothered me a little was that some of the other wait staff looked thoroughly miserable, if not downright pissed off as they were carting plates and beverages about, particularly this one guy that i nicknamed 'Lurch'.Our individual teas arrived shortly thereafter, they were fantastic! Our waiter re-filled our now empty tea pots and informed us that his shift was ending and his counterpart 'Marco' would take good care of us... it was all downhill from there.We didn't see Marco for the next 45 minutes. Our food arrived after a while, served by another waitress, my wife had the vegetarian, i had the savory. We ate our sandwiches, which were not much better than a service station packet sandwich, almost stale and kind of soggy at the same time (i suspect they were made much earlier in the day and were nothing special in the flavour dept). The scones were ok, not \u00a350 pp scones, but ok scones, at least the treats on the top teir were quite nice...Our glasses were empty by the time the meal arrived, our teapots bone dry before our first scone and plates completely finished after about 20 minutes and still no sign of Marco.If i'm paying \u00a350 for a few sweets, a couple of scones and a handfull of sandwich slivers i don't think that a full glass of water and a replenished pot of tea is too much to ask, nor should i have to try and flag down this MIA waiter, which we attempted several times, only to have him wander across the other side of the room serving others at a snails pace and ignoring us.After finally acknowledging us whilst serving a new table next to us, we politely asked for a few more savory items and a fresh pot of tea, which came... after a long time and at snails pace. I was certain that i must have somehow offended this man, despite being nothing short of patient and trying to be understanding, but why else would he avoid us like the plague? Or did he simply forget we were there?Upon finishing our tea pots again and nibbling on a few more savouries we were more than ready for our slice of cake to go and the bill... que the sound of crickets again. By the time he got around to cutting our slices, they had run out of the one i wanted.In the end we were at the saloon for about two and a half hours, which was not our intention. Half an hour of this was waiting for our reserved table, 30 minutes were spent actually eating/drinking and the remaining hour and 15 mins was either waiting for food or waiting to be noticed.By the time we got the bill i was sick and tired of the entire experience and just wanted to leave asap... then i saw the additional \u00a311 service fee that was slapped on top of our \u00a3100 bill for two mediocre snack platters with a few luke warm cups of (admittedly tasty) tea. I felt my eyeball twitching, something inside me snap and did what any discerning tourist with social anxiety would do in that moment... i bit my lip hard, paid the bill, left without talking to anyone, vowed to never return and started drafting this review in my head.I've eaten at a few nice and $$$$ places in my time and even if the food isnt quite as nice as expected, the service usually makes up for it. This establishment wasted two hours of my life, provided average food, pathetic service, terrible value for money and ruined what was a good day.",

There are different offerings on each floor with the first floor for awesome souvenirs of teas, chocolates, cookies, jams etc. I got \u00a0musical tins of chocolate cookies and they were a total hit. After the cookies were done, they act as great d\u00e9cor and mini storage of knick knacks. Forgot which floor, but I think its the third floor that has the women's apparel that also sell vintage bags including a lovely Chanel that were extremely overpriced. The ambience and d\u00e9cor of the 4th floor tea parlor is unbeatable. As you walk off the elevator, you are greeted by a polite hostess and a guy on the grand piano playing live music. Definitely make reservation! The interior is so spacious and grand with the loveliest moldings. The service is extremely polite but can be slow based on the server. The sweet pastry tea set was so much better than the savory set. The savory set offered during time of my visit was not my cup of tea. I didn't like it so my friend asked for seconds for some of the item in her set for me. Even though the set is more than enough to fill you up, you can always ask for seconds for any item in your set. We both took the slice of cake from the cake cart to go.",

Even initially after they sat me, I just sat there totally confused if they had even seen me. It would have been more than 15 mins if I didn't haul someone (which was difficult to do) - and this is just to get a menu! Honestly it just seemed like they get a lot of tourists so they want to churn out the number of seats. Very rudimentary. Sadly the decor did not make up for it.

Upon arrival on the 4th floor of the tea salon/room, the ladies at the front desk did not so much even glance at us. So, we took it to in our own hands and reviewed the menu available at the desk where they literally stood ourselves. After looking at the one of the ladies, there was still no glance in our direction, so I asked for tea for 2. \"Is that the full afternoon tea?\" she asked.\"Yes, please. This one...\" I said as I pointed to the menu.\"That is 49 pounds.\" \"Okay\" \"Per person - and it would be a 20 minute wait.\" We decided the service was extremely 'off'. We decided to eat better food elsewhere for less of a price and better where there would be less patronizing service.The food hall downstairs was the same. Selective service. Just because when travelling, we're not dressed formally, it doesn't mean we do not have cash to spend. Zero stars if possible but then the one saving grace was the doorman who was polite, smiled, made eye contact and interacted with everyone. Besides him and the online chat rep on Fortnum & Mason's website, they truly made us feel comfortable and exemplified REAL customer service.The point is, we checked it out especially as this is Her Majesty's choice so we know the price will be more expensive and that is fine. Do the ladies clarify the price, then add 'per person' with no smile, to everyone else? Very discriminating.",

    "text": "This review is gonna be lengthy, so I completely understand if you skip it...Before Fortnum, I went to the Orangery, which was nice and seemed quite traditional. \u00a0Great views of the park. \u00a0Fortnum, however, was wondrous. \u00a0I cannot express how much I love this place and someday, I hope to make my way back.I made a reservation a few weeks in advance and I really didn't know what to expect, but:1. \u00a0The pricing is a fair bit more than the Orangery.2. \u00a0It's well worth it if you want to have afternoon tea.Fortnum and Mason is apparently split up into different areas, including the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon for afternoon tea ('high tea' and 'afternoon tea' are the same thing), a large shopping area on the 1st floor, and a dessert/ice cream parlour as well as some other sections that I'm cannot for the life of me remember.Afternoon tea review: \u00a0They have several set menu options to choose from, including sweet or savory (the cost of the savory tea selection is a more) and vegetarian or regular, which was nice. \u00a0The food is refillable (yeah, that's right!) on all of them, so you can choose to have more of the items that you enjoyed. \u00a0It's a standard 3 tier tray, with sandwiches on the bottom, scones in the middle, and small desserts at the top. \u00a0There is also a dessert (cakes and pies and stuff) table hanging out for people to cut their own slices and take back to their tables. \u00a0This is included with the meal. \u00a0Everything on the dessert table was vegetarian.The vegetarian set was very good. \u00a0They had a cheese and tomato of which I opted to get more, I think a curry one, and... I don't remember the other 2. \u00a0All were pretty good. \u00a0It came with two little jars of berry jam for the scones (new and unopened), which I didn't finish but promptly took home.Teas: \u00a0Oh my holy great goodness. \u00a0The selection is overwhelming, but the Countess Grey was lovely. \u00a0Their black teas are probably the way to go, since there's a vast selection of them as opposed to the green. \u00a0They give you fresh tea leaves every time they refill your pot, so it's never watered down. \u00a0I bought the fruit tea set afterwards, and those were quite good also. \u00a0Service: \u00a0outstanding. \u00a0They refilled our teas, checked on us for refills of food, answered the million questions I asked about their teas (I'm poorly versed in English tea talk), and if the desserts and jams and things had gelatin or were they vegetarian. \u00a0I overheard/saw a man at the next table staring at one of my sandwiches and then asking a server about it (the man had opted for the regular savory tea set) and asking if he could try one of my sandwiches. \u00a0It was the cheese and tomato one- and the server brought him a few to try. \u00a0It wasn't even part of his set and they were nice enough to bring him a few.The experience itself is phenomenal, so go prepared to sit, hang out, and lounge about to live from the piano. \u00a0Enjoy!",

    "text": "The epitome of my dream London experience: afternoon tea. So when my aunt told me that she had booked us for tea during our whirlwind tour of London, I was beyond excited. And it did not disappoint one bit. We got one high tea and one savory afternoon tea--which our awesome and funny waiter suggested as we'd get to try both the sweet and savory scones and pastries. He was also quite helpful when I went to pick out what type of tea I wanted from the overwhelming tea menu. We also got to taste two different champagnes before deciding on a bottle. So after all those decisions were made, we waited for the food to appear while listening to the live piano (and the multiple renditions of \"Happy Birthday\").The food was excellent and the tea was phenomenal. We ate and ate til we couldn't eat any more. And then we found out that there was a cake cart, and our waiter was kind enough to box up our choices because we were just so full.I know I'll remember this experience forever, as it was the highlight of my trip to London. Hopefully, I'll get to go back someday!!",

Although rather pricey, food was full of flavor and servers were extremely friendly. \u00a0I ended up ordering the savory afternoon tea, which as a fair warning, is not \"light;\" they had savories like pork pie, truffle custard and rabbit rillette, which one piece of each will stuff you full.We were pleasantly surprised at the service, they were very accommodating. Some of the girls in the group had some dietary restrictions but the staff made it very easy to substitute the food. I highly suggest making reservations towards the end of afternoon tea time, they'll let you stay longer (we were told they limit your time to an hour and half or something). We found ourselves staying for a good 2 1/2 hours!",

I was expecting a grandma's bedroom and was pleasantly surprised. - Platewear: Tiffany-like plates were delightful - Options: savory or savory and sweet with sandwiches or mini entrees like beef Wellington and scotch egg. Loved this since I'm not a tea sandwich fan. Also champagne was an option to add which is fun.- Beef Wellington: slice of meat in pastry and the dark sauce on the plate was fantastic. 5 stars - Scones: the way they should be. Dense but with enough air not to be dry. 4 stars- Tea tasting: for extra an expert can choose 4 teas and take you through them. We learned how Chinese and Japanese have different techniques to make green tea and there is such a thing as yellow tea. - Full cakes: slices you chose at the end. Flourless chocolate cake was very rich and strawberry white cake was light.Midlights: - Little cakes: just ok. I liked the mocha chocolate one and the pineappley custard ones but not the othersLowlights:- Spotty service: never saw waitress after we ordered and add she forgot the champagne so we had to remind her after a half hour.Many options for tea in the city and I was delighted with this one and would return.",

There are a lot of places that do afternoon tea, but what makes F&M really stand out for me was:1. You can refill on sweets and savories in the classic afternoon tea. So if you're feeling particularly hungry, this place will fill you up! 2. They offer a tea tasting for \u00a315 (and I think that's for the table as well). You get to pick 4 teas to try and their tea expert comes over to talk about them. I loved being able to try a bunch because I was dining alone. This also really helped me narrow down which teas to purchase afterwards.3. They have 3 story store selling not just teas, but jams, champagne, picnic/gift baskets, household goods, perfumes, etc. Since I got to my reservation early, I scoped out their selection to get an idea of what I would be offered later. I didn't want to commit to anything until I tried them.Walked away with the smoky earl grey, royal blend, queen Anne, and green tea with elderflower.

Reservations are highly suggested, and my hotel concierge said I was lucky to find a spot the day before. \u00a0I was the first one to be seated as they had just opened. It was pretty cool to be the only one sitting in this grand elegant tea room decorated in the colors of F&M. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor was explained to me as \"Georgian drawing room\". \u00a0My hotel concierge recommended that I dress \"appropriately\" for this special tea. \u00a0The place setting and china was all exquisite. The staff were friendly, and the service was perfect. \u00a0This is now one of the best tea experiences I have had in my life. \u00a0They have different options in their menu to choose from ranging in prices. \u00a0It is made to share, but if you are solo like me, they pack whatever you cannot eat and you can take it away with you. \u00a0I tried the High Tea option with Lobster Omelet Victoria with Lobster Bisque & Truffle. There are not many dishes I remember the taste of. But I vividly remember the taste and texture of this amazing dish. \u00a0The lobster was cooked to perfection. Each bite melted in your mouth. \u00a0I get hungry just thinking about it! It also came with their fresh baked plan & fruit scones. \u00a0The scones with the clotted cream and F&M's strawberry preserve and lemon curd were decadent. \u00a0I think I would have preferred another round of those over the Afternoon Tea Cakes, which was a selection of individual patisseries. \u00a0I didn't even make it to the special choice from their cake carriage, and I only took a single bite from each tiny patisserie as it was an overload of sweetness. \u00a0If you want to make your time even more luxurious add a glass of champagne for only 12.50 pounds. \u00a0Might as well. \u00a0It was divine. \u00a0We haven't even mentioned the tea. F&M tea is one of my favorite tea brands. There are numerous flavors to choose from. It's overwhelming all the options, and they are all fantastic. \u00a0I always love to stock up when in London and bring several of their tea tins home with me. For a classic London tea experience that is worth every penny. This is it!",

    "text": "I love the Diamond Jubilee Tea Saloon. Its expensive compared to other Afternoon Tea options in the city, but you pay for the ambiance and the service and unlimited refills on everything.This is the place that I recommend to visiting friends and it fits their vision of a very British Afternoon Tea.While this falls in a higher price bracket, they are also not very fussy about how you are dressed. Smart jeans and a blouse are quite acceptable here, unlike some other tea rooms in this price bracket.If you don't want to splurge on the whole afternoon tea, there is the cream tea option. Personally I prefer the savoury tea menu. There are enough sweet options on this menu, but it has a nice balance of savoury items too.",

The prix fox afternoon tea is on the more expensive side of what you find in London, but worth every penny. The food is wonderful. Lobster omelette is out of this world. The little sandwiches are great. The tower of food you get is unlimited. The service is impeccable. There is no dress code, but do yourself a favor and toss on a jacket. Have some respect for yourself, you slob.",

Didn't want to spend a ridiculous amount but also was willing to spend more than I normally would to have a good experience. My friend told me about Fortnum & Mason, so we decided on this spot. WOw! It is beautiful from the outside. Walking in, I was amazed. Multiple stories selling not only tea but other goods as well.. We had a reservation and there were many open tables when we got there but I believe it is probably almost all from reservations only. The service we received was ok, but we did have to wait a while after we were seated for anyone to come by to answer any questions or get our tea started! We got two of the savory option but I wonder if getting one sweet one savory would've been a better idea to try more? The finger sandwiches were pretty good! Everything including the scones was pretty good, but I don't really remember thinking anything was out of this world. I got the fortmason tea, which was amazing!!! I loved it so much I ended up buy two boxes of it afterwards. It was a good experience because I love tea and had good company in a cute place, but just not sure if it was worth how much we spent for this experience. In USD it came out to about $80 per person.",

    "text": "So, one of the ultimate desires for my wife, was to experience High noon tea, during our stay in London. She researched various reviews, and Fortnum came in at the top five. It's conveniently located pretty close to the tube and one of our favorite places, Carnaby. So we went to the fourth floor, was greeted and seated, and given explanation of the various styles of experiences, as well as, several teas to select from. Anywhere from the Royal to something more current like a chai tea. They even offer some rare teas, which was a little more spendy, but not bad. Of course, the typical Earls and breakfast teas. I myself, selected the Afternoon Tea, and the Royal as my choice of tea. Other than the presentation, which was very elegant, the tea tasted like any other tea. Nothing special that I could detect, at least. What was cool about it was the history of the tea, which they all come with some type of informational about the tea.The assortment of finger sandwiches was awesome! My favorite was the salmon and believe it or not, the cucumber sandwich. The biscuits were pretty decent, but the pastries and little desserts were incredibly succulent! The place definitely has an upscale vibe to it. If you're wearing a hat, take it off \u00a0After our tea and snacks, we enjoyed three levels (1-3) of Fortnum's shopping delicacies, teas, and assortments. Checked this off the bucket list, and now we can say we enjoyed afternoon tea. As always, enjoy and Happy Sipping with the Pinky Out!",

    "text": "Fortnum and Mason's Diamon Jubilee Tea Salon is a conveniently located place for traditional afternoon tea in London.Located on the top floor of Fortnum and Mason's luxurious Piccadilly digs, the tea salon greets you with courteous staff and the tinkling of live and well-played piano.We were seated promptly and were given a good amount of time to strategize. There are several set menus around the 50 pound mark, including savory and sweet options. I went for the savory with the basic tea, and my boyfriend did the surf and turf with premium tea. Do note that dietary restrictions are easily accommodated, at least on the vegetarian and nut allergy side.The pacing is relaxed, which is perfect so that you don't fill up too much. The tea sandwiches were all exemplary. The surf and turf was tiny but good quality.The savory pastries were a real treat; elevated, somewhat surreal dishes like a smoked salmon macaron and a truffle cream puff. The sweet stuff was all good too. The scones are classic and worth the stomach space. We had to turn down the cake cart by the end since we were so full, and were offered some to go. We also got to take home strawberry preserves and lemon curd as we had barely made a dent in them.All of the tea was great, though note that you'll only likely get to try two per person in terms of the timing. My picks, the Jubilee and a chocolate violet tea, were both lovely. I think the basic selection has enough variety and high enough quality that upgrading isn't necessary.Bookings are essential, but are easy to come by. Service was great; our waiter did a good job reinforcing the manners and order of the tea service without being condescending. It's recommended to dress well, though we saw lots of people breaking that. I personally welcomed the chance to dress up a little in a sundress.Bathrooms are clean. Save some time to browse the rest of the floors after.If you're looking for a traditional British tea, this will satisfy the tourist urges in a classy way.",

    "text": "A beautiful tea room and a live pianist. How could anyone ask for more?They basically have two choices for afternoon tea: the regular, which is mostly sweet and the savory. There is also a vegetarian option, which looked pretty darn delicious at the next table over.We ordered both to share. The savory and sweet come with the same sandwiches: Coronation Chicken is a curried salad and is my favorite, the Egg Salad uses a rare breed of hen with a very creamy egg, the Cucumber has a great spread of cream cheese with mint, Ham is ham, and the Smoked Salmon is meaty and less fishy and balances nicely with tomato.The savory scones: Mmmm Bacon! The Tomato one is like a high-end Ritz cracker with a crispy, cheesy layer on top. Both come with complementary spreads, heavy hybrids of butter and cream cheese.I like the sweet scones a lot better. (personal preference - both are equally good). The berry scone is nice, and the plain is perfect, especially with that thick clotted cream and the best lemon curd and strawberry jam I've ever had.The savory top tier is 3 meals in itself. Everything is heavy and rich. There's a pinwheel of smoked salmon in a macaron. The Crab Salad is heavy on the mayo, and if that's not enough, the Foie Gras will finish you off. The Green Cashew Cheesecake is surprisingly light, but the Wild Mushroom Puff with Truffle is not and it is amazing.The top tier of sweets are great, but we couldn't even get through them! Everything is so buttery and rich, that carb coma just sneaks up unexpectedly. Fortunately, they still taste great later in the day. There is a moist and buttery pound cake, an airy strawberry mousse, a well-balanced cheesecake, a passion cake with passion, and a creamy something with a rose petal on top. On top of ALL of that, you get a slice of carriage cake too. The Victoria Sponge is fluffy and just the right hint of sweetness, and the Battenberg Cake too pretty to resist.My only regret is not getting to try more teas. I should have ordered an Earl Grey but I started light with the Silver Needle Pekoe and then the Yellow Buds, thinking I would have room for more. Plus the afternoon tea is AYCE, and I wish I could have found more room somewhere, especially for those scones. Guess I'll have to come back for more!",

It's lovely, the decorations and the sophistication of everything including the decor, the tea sets etc is truly beautiful and relaxing.We got he sweet and savory tea options. I preferred the savory it was much more delicious than the sweetZ to be honest I didn't like any of the sweet pastries offered they tasted pre-made.The savory afternoon tea was honesty TO DIE FOR!! The eclair with mushroom truffle cream was one of the best things I've eaten in years! The Great thing is you can get unlimited sandwiches/scones, pastries etc. we got extra eclairs and I regret not getting more, that's how divine it was!! It's worth it for the experience but he sweet I would give it 3* but the experience bumps it to 4* and the savory tea! You can change tea selections as much as you want but they fill the pot each time so choose wisely! At the end there is a cake section but there was only 3 when we went we asked them to pack it to go and honestly it wasn't that good. Nice to try but they were all dry. So all in all it was a fabulous experience!! I would do it again!",

They also have an option for savory scones which comes with different spreads instead of the OG lemon curd, strawberry jam, and clotted cream.Service was friendly enough, not outstanding though, guy seemed a bit rushed. The sandwiches were good - I got 2 plates. That was a mistake because the scones were even better and I wish I had more room. Seriously, eat the scones first. Dessert was really pretty but didn't taste as amazing as it looked. The cakes were better than the dessert tray. Highly recommend the coconut one. Tea - tons of options. I went with the classic darjeeling but I tried a fruity one that was fantastic. Also, make reservations on opentable in advance. They were super booked.Be sure to check out the shops on the lower level, and the bathrooms holy cow.",

    "text": "A lovely high tea experience that is traditional and luxurious without being pretentious. The Tea Salon is located on the 4th floor of Fortnum & Mason. The dress code is \"smart casual\", which basically means just don't dress like a homeless person. My boyfriend and I wore jeans and sweaters and were warmly welcomed by the staff. We made a reservation on their website, which was easy to navigate using Opentable. We arrived 10 minutes early, and were seated at a set table immediately.Our server was Leonardo, who was lovely. Highly knowledgeable of tea, as well as experienced in the culture of the English tradition. We perused the menu and were happy to find that they offer a fully vegan High Tea for \u00a349 per person, which includes both sweet and savory food options along with your choice of Fortnum's famous blends or rare tea. The silver deco multi-tiered trays are replenished as you eat them, with your favorites from the selection. I loved the cucumber sandwiches and the fruit scones the best, especially with their house made lemon curd and strawberry jam. Come hungry-high tea for two ended up being a surprisingly large amount of food. After finishing with the food, we ordered two additional pots of tea, which ended up being our two favorites-The Vanilla Nougat, which tasted like smooth caramel and milk chocolate, and their signature Fortmason, a subtly floral tea smelling of orange blossom. I also enjoyed the Royal Blend, which paired nicely with the food. All of their teas are available for purchase on the 1st floor if you'd like to take some home or as a gift. I highly recommend afternoon tea at the Diamond Parlor for both locals or visitors to London.",

However, the hostess (Eugenia?) did not check us in correctly and gave us a table not in the best location when we requested to be closer to the piano. Staff is pleasant but make sure the hostess checks you in properly. Overall a very nice ambience and experience. Everything was delicious, waiter was very sweet but disappointed with the hostess. Maybe because we are asian she sat us in the back with the other asian folks who knows. Possibly a coincidence. She also made sure to show us the menu price somewhat implying that we couldn't afford to be here? We got the afternoon tea and savory - the countess grey was delicious.",

    "text": "I had one day in London. Every time I travel solo, I try to book an activity or a dinner reservation for each day so I make sure I get out of the hotel room (introvert problems). For London, I booked afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason, and I was completely dazzled.The tea salon is on the top floor of what I can only describe as a tea department store, including home goods and beauty products. I was pretty tired after a day of exploring the city, so after climbing a few flights, I took the elevator up to the 5th floor, and was greeted by a friendly hostess, who showed me to my seat and took my coat. Everything being robin's egg blue, I felt a bit like I was having tea at Tiffany's.I had chosen F&M for my afternoon tea adventure not only because I knew they had delicious teas, but because they have a vegan option for the food. Three tiers of finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts, all vegan! For two hours, I sipped tea and nibbled away, delighted by everything I tasted. I loved the grilled corguettes with tarragon pesto sandwich, and the grilled peppers with hummus. The scones are what blew me away. I don't ever remember having such delicious scones, but I definitely haven't had ones these good since going vegan. They're amazing! Buttery with a perfect crumb. I topped them with vegan butter and blueberry jam.The dangers of unlimited refills, I filled up on scones before I could even get to the desserts. It was worth it, especially when they brought out hot scones fresh from the oven. I died.Seeing my defeat, my lovely waiter offered to pack up the desserts for me, and included a few more scones for me to enjoy for breakfast the next morning. Amazing.Knowing I couldn't take it with me, I had to at least taste the raspberry panacotta. One bite turned into two and before I knew it, it had been devoured. In my defense, it was light as air, and topped with a rose petal. How was I supposed to resist something topped with a rose petal? I'm only human.For the tea, I enjoyed the Royal Blend and the Earl Grey Classic. I ended up purchasing a container of Royal Blend tea as a souvenir, it was so lovely and smooth.Every detail felt luxurious, and to have a vegan afternoon tea in London was worth every pound I had to fork over (and every pound I'm sure I gained). I'm already dreaming of bringing my mom or my best friend to London so we can have an afternoon tea together!",

    "text": "When in London, having an afternoon high tea is a must! I decided to come here on my trip to London as several of my friends recommended this place. It is royal warranted by the Queen and Prince of Wales, and is one of the most iconic afternoon high teas you can have in London. The price is a bit steep if you walk in, but I did a bit of research and got a better deal by purchasing vouchers through Virgin Experience online. It's 96 pounds for two people and you get complimentary champagne! We also found a discount code online which took another 25% off!Now about the afternoon tea experience. We made reservations so we didn't have to wait. Once we got seated, our server came to explain the menu and recommended that we order one sweet and one savoury tea set so we can have more variety. You can request seconds for anything you finished and would like more. There's also a cake table on the middle of the room where you can help yourself to some cake. Honestly, the tea sets itself were already enough food. We couldn't finish everything but we can pack the remainder to go. I really enjoyed the scones, the lemon curd and strawberry jams. The sandwiches were alright and overall the food was decent but not out of this world (probably 4 stars) but my review is 5 stars because of the experience and service. I can try one tea and then switch to another tea if I didn't like it. There's live music - someone playing piano. I can even pack the cans of jams to go. We were never rushed and can pretty much take our time and enjoy ourselves. After we were done eating, we headed down to the ground floor to purchase some tea and biscuits to take home as souvenirs. The whole place was like afternoon tea heaven. This was one of my favourite parts of the trip!",

On March 1, 2012 her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited F&M to open the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon. This place was opened to celebrate her reign and for her to inspect the products to celebrate this special occasion. Location: The Jubilee Tea Salon is located on the fourth floor of Fortnum and Mason. The design team David Collins Studio acclaim the interior is to imitate a Georgian drawing room with subtle architectural reminders of Fortnum's early days in the 1700s. During Christmas they incorporate the F&M Jubilee Tea Salon colors into the Christmas decorations which are very elegant and tasteful. Reservations: Recommended 1-2 weeks in advance for weekdays and 4-6 weeks in advance for weekends. Many tourist we saw got turned away due to not having a reservation and were told to eat downstairs. It seems required.Dress code: \"Elegance is key\". I would say Business smart/casual to business formal. Though some people do dress up a bit more for special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. Cost: It is a elegant and refined place to enjoy afternoon tea. With its iconic eau de nil and white decor. Standard afternoon tea is 49p and with a savory/rare tea option is 53p. You can add champagne for 12.5p per glass or a tea tasting experience for 12.5p per table. Time: F&M Jubilee Tea Salon offers all day dining Monday-Saturday 11:30 -9:30 pm and Sunday 12-6pm. Tea: The selection of 79 teas each uniquely has its own history and journey providing the aroma and taste such as the boiling temperature. With one's selection of tea, there is a choice between their standard selection and rare tea selection. Tea is a product that F&M has taken seriously since the beginning of their history. In 1720 they purchased a 301lbs of Bohea tea from the East India Company for 15 shillings a pound. Food: Accompanying one's tea is the selection of beautiful bites from their afternoon tea menu options. I opted for the standard afternoon tea and my husband the savory afternoon tea. They do offer high tea, Children Menus or Gluten, Dairy, Vegetarian & Vegan Menus. All of the menus can be found on their website. With any selection you are free to also sample items from the cake carriage. Also for men, the food is unlimited :P. Service: Outstanding. The staff are professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. From our hostess who helped answers on our way out of how to get back to our hotel, to our waiter. I had no idea what to order as it was my first time. \u00a0Our waitress helped me choose what would suit my palette best. In addition she was extremely friendly and helped take pictures of hubby and I to commemorate our visit. This was our favorite location to enjoy afternoon tea. It felt classic, elegant, and relaxing. If you are a tourist, I feel this is an excellent place to pick for afternoon tea. One can shop before and / or after your visit for afternoon tea. The dress code is practical and time efficient with not having to go home to change into a suit or dress(and heels). Its relatively private, quiet, and relaxing from the hectic London while sightseeing especially (running from attraction to attraction -trying to see as much as possible). The price is reasonable and has something for everyone of all ages. Lastly, enough food for the guys (unlimited). Also, in Christmas time there is ice skating for the kids on the other side of the building. They can go ice skating while the parents come up here for some afternoon tea. Highly recommend.",

Although I have been to London before and have experienced both the fancy and the casual cream tea affair, Bob had yet to experience the joy of scones and a delicious cup of tea. We looked online at the London Tea Guild's website and found that Fortnum and Mason received excellent reviews. We were able to get a reservation that was more around the lunch hour than the regular \"tea time\" because they are packed around the holidays.The tea room itself is very... blue. The color is everywhere and it does feel a bit like Tiffany's when you walk in. Aside from the color, it is a very formal feeling affair but no snobbery to speak of. The service was impeccable. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and walked us through their GIGANTIC tea menu and the different options they had available. We decided to opt for the cream tea and their savory tea options with the traditional Fortnum tea blend. The cream tea was wonderful! All of the sandwiches were delightful and the scones... MY GOD THE SCONES! They were phenomenal. I would have taken 10 and just stuffed them in my purse if it was socially appropriate to do so. The clotted cream and jam was also fantastic - probably the best strawberry jam I have had in a while. The savory tea was also great - wonderful cheese and ham scones with basil cream cheese! The only downside was the dessert from the cream tea. It was not great. The desserts were a little dry and VERY sweet. The dessert from the dessert cart was also a little too sweet for my liking... but everything else was delicious! Overall, this is a wonderful (albeit quite touristy) thing to do - but still something fun to experience and quite tasty! So raise those pinkies high people and enjoy!",

I am so glad I went with the Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon at Fortnum and Mason for our afternoon tea experience. We ordered the regular afternoon tea on the menu which includes the traditional fare with a lot of options for the value. Also included cake or another dessert which we barely had room for! The only complaint I would say from dining here was that my husband noticed a foul odor of fish when we walked in the room. Smoked salmon sandwiches are on the menu so it could be due to this. However, I did not see this as detracting from the many positives and spectacular atmosphere and tea experience. Make reservations online!",

This place is so clean, service is absolutely great (our server was Jonathan and he was awesome - he made it even better!), food is good, and tea is great! This is a tea Salon, not a restaurant or a bar or a coffee shop. TEA is the main deal... Please, remember that :) Greta selection - better to pay extra and get top tea (it is worth it). If you really want a English TEA experience I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "The afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason's Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon was hands down, the best I've EVER had! I ordered the gluten free option, while my tea-mate ordered the regular. Let me explain to you why you shouldn't over think whether or not to go to F&M over somewhere else for their gluten free tea...BECAUSE F&M IS THE BEST! We both had the exact same sandwiches (except mine was on lovely gluten free breads that were moist and didn't fall apart), warm scones (my tea-mate claimed that the gluten free scones were even better than the regular scones...wonderful texture and didn't crumble), and the gluten free pastries on the top layer (chocolate cupcake, macaroon, pound cake, and something else lovely). Absolutely, I cannot claim that any other tea room comes even close to the quality of F&M's gluten free tea snacks. The teas were also magnificent (we loved the Countess Grey, jasmine pearls, and the darjeelings). The service was so incredibly friendly, and they made us feel welcome to request more of anything we liked on the tea snack platter. Just to drive this point that the F&M gluten free menu was amazing...I recently went for afternoon tea at a different highly regarded tea room...and I was heavily disappointed with the sorbet and fruit platter that was the replacement for pastries, and amuse bouche spoons that were filled with sandwich filling...COME ON! Why can't everyone else take a pointer from F&M and make some real gluten free options rather than just deleting the breads and pastries!!!Since our return from London, I have tried to make us afternoon tea...but we will always remember and look forward to our return to F&M.***I uploaded a picture of the gluten free platter so you can see for yourself that you get REAL scones, sandwiches, and pastries!!!",

    "text": "This is definitely something you should experience if you are visiting London. True, there are a lot of cheaper high tea places even outside of London...and Fortnum and Mason seems to be quite touristy due to its association with the royal family, but you simply can't beat the experience.We ordered the tea service. Unlike some other places, you are not allowed to share tea services (they charge by head), as you get unlimited refills on the food. May I suggest that you come hungry?It's a three tier tea service -- you get cakes and pastries on the top, scones on the middle, and sandwiches on the bottom. The sandwiches were fantastic -- even the humble cucumber sandwich was done really, really well. The cakes and pastries were really good as well -- I would have destroyed them if I wasn't sick and had a reduced appetite. However, the scones disappointed me, as I've definitely had better elsewhere (Mandarin Oriental has spectacular scones), but the jam and clotted cream saved them somewhat.I've had better tea service elsewhere, but none of them have service that is quite as English-style as it is here. But be warned... Be on your best behaviour here! They don't seem to tolerate much touristy bullshit. My friend who appeared late got her own food, but since I could not finish my tea service at all, she took some of the sandwiches and started eating (without asking, but we are on share-all-food terms ;). We weren't going to get seconds, but our waitress might have been a bit distressed by us...",

The restaurant is very elegant, calm, and tranquil. \u00a0It was nice to relax and chill while a rain storm passed through the city. The fresh plain & fruit scones, served with clotted cream and your choice of Fortum & Mason preserves, where fantastic. I had the Fortnum's High Tea and chose the Lobster Omelette Victoria with Lobster Bisque and Truffle. The tea cakes had individual patisserie and a choice of one selection from the cake cart. My favorite treats where the rose \u00e9clair and the coconut mango macaron. The fresh berry sponge was very moist. I would prefer fresh lemon curd at a tea, but Fortnum & Mason's packaged lemon curd with free range egg and Sicilian lemon juice is very yummy. \u00a0They offer an extensive choice of Fortnum's famous blends or rare teas. \u00a0My only criticism was the service. Our waiter left for a long period of time for a cigarette break (You could smell it when he returned.) He left three tables mid-service without coverage. \u00a0We sat with empty plates and tea pots and looked at each other as we waited for his return. Reservations are highly recommended. Book the classic English afternoon tea on-line at fortumandmason.com; opentable.co.uk.; or reservations@fortnumandm\u2026 Gift cards are also available.",

Situated on the 4th floor we were greeted by a lady behind a reception desk and a pianist tinkerling the ivories. Coats were taken and after short while we were whisked through the tea room to our table. A gorgeous afternoon tea set was set out and we were given a couple of menus - one food and another teas - 85 in total! Wow wee! After choosing our menu of choice we took in the surroundings. This place loses a star for the service being slow. I know it's afternoon tea why the need to rush, but I was gasping for a cup of tea! Our tea trays then arrived with sandwiches, homemade jams and conserves and sweet pastries. Every morsel was delicious and a dessert tray featured in the centre of the room if you were able to squeeze in more cake! The experience as a whole was good, but I've had better! Tourists also grace this place with their rucksacks (yes I am a snob) so if you want a sophisticated experience then you may wish to go elsewhere.Doggie bags were kindly given for the treats we didn't eat.",

The sandwiches were very bland and I did give the food allergy notice in advance hoping that they would make a bit more variety but they didn't we were just given 2 types of sandwich, the tea was very normal, nothing special. The scones were quite hard and they only had minima variety of jams available. The little pastries that come with the afternoon tea were really not tasty at all. Their macarons are not good, they tasted quite buttery unlike Laduree, the banana loaf cake was also hard it did not melt in the mouth. Overall, it is not worth the \u00a350 per person that was spent here, would rather go for a nice meal elsewhere and buy lots of macarons from Laduree. Not value for money at all, I was upset and disappointed.",

The tea room is very elegant and the fine china are all in the very pleasant bluish green color. They offer several kinds of full set afternoon teas, some a combo of sweet and savory and one savory only. My friend and I both ordered the afternoon tea which offers the most variety. Of course, we mustn't forget about the tea. You can choose from several pages of Fortnum and Mason specialty tea.The food came in a 3-tier tower: the lowest tier were an assortment of dainty finger sandwiches, the middle tier were a couple of scones and the top tier were some very nice looking desserts. I was mostly excited about the desserts, but decided to eat my way up. I was secretly deciding to ask for a second chocolate dessert thing before I even started. You see, it is all you can eat and you need to plan ahead. However, I felt stuffed at scone level already. I pushed myself to take a couple of bites of each dessert and then I admitted defeat. It is a good way to spending a rainy afternoon catching up with good friends. However, make sure you have your credit card ready, because this is not cheap.",

    "text": "During our London trip, I was looking forward to afternoon tea and all of its fanciness. \u00a0I had absolutely no idea where to get tea, if you needed reservations, how dressed up you had to be, etc. A friend of mine who had more of an insight recommended Fortnum and Mason for high tea. \u00a0So glad we went!First, the gals at the front desk greeted us, took our coats, and led us to our table. \u00a0We opted for the high priced high tea menu, which included a small entree instead of the regular finger sandwiches that are offered with other tea menus. \u00a0My husband and I chose the London smoked salmon. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Nice and delicate, while meaty enough to be filling. \u00a0Our friend ordered the lobster omelette victoria. \u00a0The eggs were nice and fluffy, while also being filling.The rest of the tea goodies included scones (regular and raisen) and a variety of desserts. \u00a0Side note...if you still have room in your belly, you can ask for more of any of the scones and desserts for free! \u00a0I will say that I was very happy with the scones, especially since I had them with the greatest jams ever (raspberry, apricot, and my favorite lemon curd). \u00a0They were also served with clotted cream, which is kinda like butter in it's smoothness but without the intense richness.The desserts looked incredible, but I was a smidge disappointed in the taste. \u00a0The plum macaron had a crunchy cookie and there was too much filling. \u00a0The chocolate cake with gold leaf was intensely rich. \u00a0There was a marshmallowy cup type dessert that didn't live up to my s'mores expectations. \u00a0The one dessert that I was over the moon for was the mocha/lemon/rice krispy type layered cake. \u00a0I can't tell you what it was called, but it was delicious!So the whole point of afternoon tea is the tea, of course. \u00a0Each of us had 3 different types of tea. \u00a0There is a menu of about 80 different teas, so it was definitely overwhelming. \u00a0I like the fruity teas myself, so I opted for the green tea with apple (light), black tea with strawberry (darker), and black tea with peach (darker). \u00a0All were delicious, but the green tea with apple was probably my favorite because of the lighter consistency.This place is a pretty penny definitely, but the experience is incredible. \u00a0The service is top notch!",

    "text": "Afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason was one of the highlights of the trip me and my husband recently took to London! We arrived without a reservation, and only had to wait a few minutes for a table to be prepared for us (though it was busy there - I imagine in busier tourist times like the height of summer a reservation may be needed to ensure you can have tea at your preferred time). I am pregnant, so once we sat down, we asked a few questions about items being pasteurized and also substituting some of the savory items on the classic tea to ensure I could eat everything. \u00a0The servers were very helpful with providing information and offering alternative options. They even pointed me towards the herbal teas section of the menu to ensure I knew these were the decaffeinated teas available. When we asked for certain items to be refreshed, the substituted items were properly substituted again without us needing to ask or say something, which I appreciated. The food and tea on the whole were excellent and plentiful. As mentioned in other reviews, all the items can be refreshed, so this tea can really be made into a full meal. The ability to try different teas was really nice - I tried two of the herbal teas and my husband tried two of the black teas and one herbal tea. Overall, we enjoyed all of them, and the server was helpful in offering suggestions or clarifying details of the teas when we asked.I removed one star from my review as we did have a few minor hiccups in service, specifically when asking for a refresh on some items. It took ~20 minutes for a new pot of tea for my husband at one point and also for some additional small desert items to arrive. However, when we followed up with our server to ask where these items were, she was apologetic and brought them right away. On the whole, the service was excellent and the servers regularly asked about what else they could bring us, even packing up and sending us home with a couple of items from the desert cart as we were too full to eat any more while we were there! We also never felt rushed during our tea, even though were were at our table for over 2 hours.I highly recommend Fortnum and Mason if you are looking for a more upscale afternoon tea option. It is a bit pricy, but I really felt that it is a worthwhile cost for what you get - good service, excellent food, great atmosphere. I plan to go back on my next trip to London!",

    "text": "I have been to tea in the Fortnum and Mason: DIamond Jubilee Tea Salon twice and both times have been absolutely flawless. From the moment you walk out of the elevator into the light blue lobby of the restaurant, you are met with soft music and elegance. It's a fairy-tale setting for a very special meal. The service here is exemplary. On our last visit, they had trouble finding our reservation but handled it without a hitch, seating us regardless. Our waiter answered any and all of our tea-novice questions, with a smile. The Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but the experience of dining in such a special and elegant setting is definitely worth it. I was lucky enough to be brought here by family on their visits to London, and it is a beautiful place to celebrate a special occasion. I have tried both the standard and savoury teas and they are both stunning. If you are eating with a friend, I highly suggest getting one of each (as you are able to order unlimited refills of all items served) so that you can try everything! The sandwiches are perfect (try not to fill up on them) and the sweet and savoury pastries are very delicious. It is impossible not to leave here stuffed...but make sure to take some Victoria sponge to go!!",

I saw quite a few groups of people wearing t shirts and sandals which I definitely won't considered as \"smart casual\". \u00a0The service was bad for one specific waiter (others seem to be fine) but that ruins our experience. The waiter didn't ask what we would like to drink in the beginning. We added Champagne and water later on and he didn't bother to ask us what type of champagne or water we would like. He assumed the Champagne we would like and bring it to us directly. The explanation of the difference of the tea is also unprofessional as if we are not worth his time for the explanation.Besides this specific waiter, the experience overall is ok. If you don't mind a tourist hype kind of place, might worth visiting once. I personally wouldn't come back again.",

    "text": "Definitely worth the splurge. At \u00a340-44 per person, I had high hopes and I'm happy to say that my expectations were met. Though my mother and I dressed up a little bit, my dad dropped the ball and had a t-shirt and hoodie (luckily pants and not jeans). However, this did not affect the service and they treated us well. I went with the High Tea Menu and my parents went with the Savoury and Afternoon Tea Menus. Mine came with a choice of appetizers, and I chose eggs benedict. Though it looked a bit uninteresting, the egg was poached perfectly and the sauce was good; a pretty solid version of the classic. My parents both had finger sandwiches with theirs and our server mentioned that the sandwiches could be refilled. But we were ready to move onto the good stuff.The teas themselves were excellent. I started with Smoky Earl Grey, which was lovely. Later on, our server recommended the Lapsang Suchong, which was even better. Then the three-tiered dessert stands arrived. The sweets were all very nice but I felt the scones and savouries were the show-stoppers. The clotted cream and lemon curd were delicious and the scones were warm and really just perfect. My favourite piece from the savoury tray was oeuf drumkilbo; an egg with the top cut off and served with crab and caviar. I'm not ashamed to say that I asked for two more. Coming in second was the crab vol au vent and trout mousse on almond shortbread. For the sweets, I mostly enjoyed the rose \u00e9clair and the macaron. We also asked for 'refills' of those, and our server offered to just bring a whole new plate of desserts for us. She was very kind and didn't make us feel bad for wanting more. Now we had been there for just short of 2 hours, so we felt we should go even though no one was rushing us out of the door. But you also get a slice of cake from the cake carriage! We were already quite full by then and were about to pass, but then our server offered to box up a slice of each cake for us! Along with the cakes, she boxed up ALL of our leftovers with care, even the lemon curd and unopened jam. Unfortunately she didn't included the clotted cream for whatever reason, but that was probably good since I would have eaten it straight out of the cup with a spoon.. This was totally worth the price and I can highly recommend it. Just make reservations when you can; I saw several parties being turned away as they were fully booked at 4pm on a Wednesday.",

Salmon, egg salad, chicken salad, cucumber and cheese and ham. \u00a0My favorite was the chicken salad... so they gave extra of that one.The savory tower was also nice... savory scones and other items. \u00a0There was a goat cheese item that was also great, along with a chicken pastry.They even packed all of the leftovers, and gave us the 2 bottles of jam that came with my wife's tea.Best part of the meal was the service. \u00a0Friendly and professional.. that made the meal worth it, and made for a memorable experience.I would recomend them to anyone looking for an exceptional place for tea in London.",

The service wasn't fantastic - I had booked in advance as I had family visiting and was left waiting for about 45 minutes for our table. The desserts were ok, but maybe I had too high expectations. Nevertheless I have given them 3 stars (really, 3.5) for a few reasons.1. Although I preferred the Scones at Browns (these are the only 2 High Teas I've had in London, mind you), the sandwiches were DELICIOUS, like, I could not put them down. They were SO SO good. I would come back just for them, hah!2. Although the staff looked super pissed off, when we asked if we could take home the remains of our tea, we were surprised to find that they had gift wrapped everything in beautiful takeout boxes, and had even given us the remaining jars of jam! I guess they couldn't really have given it to anyone else as all the jars on your table are new.. but I'm talking full on, real life size jam jar! I guess it is a pretty pricey meal but, I thought it was a nice gesture anyway.But yes, 3 (point 5) stars for the sandwiches! And the pretty interior.",

If it's good enough for the Queen, then it's certainly good enough for me!Be sure to make a reservation. I saw a few people get denied at the door because they were fully booked on a Sunday afternoon. You'll also want to check in your coats and bags! There's no need for them during your time here. Keep your camera for pictures though. We had a massive backpack that we checked and we're happy that we did as it would have looked really out of place in the dining room. Both the savory and sweet afternoon teas are delicious. Try to order one of each set so you can sample everything. Each plate level is replenishable, so by all means, go for it if your stomach capacity permits.This was a great part of the trip since it gave us an opportunity to relax and chill out a bit before going hard out on the town. It's also fun to walk around Fortnum and Mason afterwards and try to exercise off some of those tea sandwiches and scones!",

I especially love their scones, \u00a0they were warm, soft and flaky. The cream and jam it came with were exquisite. The savory afternoon tea set was very good as well, I like almost every piece of their mini sandwiches.

    "text": "When you visit a restaurant where the afternoon/high teas start at \u00a344.00 per person, you expect a lot. \u00a0Without question. \u00a0Yes, there's a difference between afternoon and high tea (google it). \u00a0Plus, there are 2 types of afternoon tea (savoury and sweet). \u00a0There's also a 12.5% gratuity automatically added to the bill.We went on a Monday afternoon, and although I'd made a reservation, there was no need. \u00a0We were sitted next to a window, and a note on their website says that they can't guarantee that. \u00a0However, I don't think it's a big deal. \u00a0The view out of the window is of the neighbouring office block. \u00a0It's not spectacular at all.The menu can be confusing to some people. \u00a0You can get endless refills of the food and tea if you want. \u00a0You can request a tea sampling if you want. \u00a0You can get a free dessert if you want. \u00a0All of this isn't explained that well on the menu and to some people, this matter can cause a certain discomfort.Our waiters were a bit disappointing. \u00a0One of them poured the black tea in before the milk (the milk should be poured in first as that reduces the risk of the bone china cups cracking because of the hot tea). \u00a0One waiter didn't tell us where the dessert station was, and I had to stand up, and walk around trying to find it. \u00a0One of the tea caddies had faded colouring on it. \u00a0Normally, these matters don't matter so much, but when you're paying over \u00a3103.00 for 2 people (as I did), then you expect something close to perfection. \u00a0These small issues were matters that could easily have been avoided, and weren't due to a jammed packed restaurant, short staff, or matters that the restaurant had no control over.At restaurants like this, it's not unreasonable to expect the staff to almost have the ability to predict what the clients need and want. \u00a0After all, the staff are there every day, and should have a good idea of the wants and needs of the clients. \u00a0Many people (me included), don't go to restaurants like this that often, and to a degree, we need some sort of guidance on how to go about things.So, that's why I'm giving it only 4 stars. \u00a0The food and drink itself are very good, so no complaints there.It was my girlfriend's birthday and after I mentioned that, they played \"Happy Birthday to you\" for her. \u00a0Plus, we got a candle on her piece of cake.By the way, I'm not a snob or anything like that. \u00a0However, I did notice that some clients wore jeans. \u00a0That's fine for most occasions. \u00a0But I don't think it's appropriate for this particular restaurant. \u00a0If you're looking for a supreme and perfect experience, I find it difficult to recommend this restaurant. \u00a0Next time around, I'll try Claridge's, the Dorchester, the Ritz, or the Savoy. \u00a0But maybe they're all the same.",

    "text": "As a first-time visitor to London, I wanted to experience a proper afternoon tea. Fortnum and Mason's Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon always came up in my searches, so we made a reservation (via OpenTable) here for 5:30pm on a Wednesday afternoon. The atmosphere in the tea salon was definitely posh with piano playing in the background and many people dressed according to the \"smart casual\" policy that Fortnum and Mason has. However, there were certainly a lot of people who were underdressed, wearing t-shirts with leggings, or even cheap flip flops. So while there IS a dress code, it doesn't appear to be very strictly enforced.My husband and I both opted for the regular afternoon tea which is \u00a344 (so about $56-$60 depending on the exchange rate) per person. I regret not choosing the savoury afternoon tea because we would have had more variety then. As many other reviewers have said, you can refill the finger sandwiches, scones, sweets, and teas as needed -- you just need to ask your waiter. However, the scones and sandwiches were only mediocre. They were both dry, and no amount of clotted cream or lemon curd could cover that up.So the main reason for the 2-star rating is because the service was absolutely horrendous. Our water glasses were never refilled and we barely saw our server. We spent half an hour looking around us to see if we were able to spot our waiter so that we could get refills of our tea, water, and sandwiches. When we were finally able to get his attention, we eventually got our tea and sandwich refills maybe after another 20 minutes, but not water refills (we gave up on this because we couldn't find our waiter again). When my husband and I were ready to pay, we again could not find our waiter anywhere, and spent another half hour at our table looking around for him. We finally flagged down a waiter for another table, who helped us box up our leftover sweets and some cakes to take home. Oh - our waiter did show up at the end to present us with the bill. I would hate to think that the terrible service could be a result of my skin color or the fact that my husband and I are a mixed-race couple, but I did not notice any other tables having the same experience. In total, we spent close to 2 hours here when the time-limit is 1.5 hours, but most of it was because we were waiting for the waiter.For the price that we paid, I expected better service. The tea itself was excellent though (which is why this is not a 1-star review).",

    "text": "Fortnum and Mason has been the standard for traditional afternoon tea. If you're looking for the typical London tea experience - you have to stop by here. I wouldn't come here toooo often as it's on the high end - \u00a340-48/person ($62-75 USD). {BOOKING}- If you're trying to get a weekend, I would suggest booking at least a month + ahead. Those Saturday afternoons are especially difficult to come by. For weekdays, a month ahead should be fine. I wouldn't even try to walk in - it's pretty packed. - You can go through OpenTable (online), or you can call (020 7734 8040). {DRESS CODE} - Smart Casual: They ask to refrain from wearing sportswear (I suppose tennis shoes etc). Was this enforced? I don't think it's strictlyy enforced but I would just try to look nice. {SERVICE}- Eh. I've had better service other places. I found it slightly difficult to get the servers attention :/. They also weren't very good at clearing off extra dishes and teapots when we started to order extra so that the table got cluttered. \u00a0{DECOR}- My mother commented that it looked like a chinese dim sum eating place .. which it did minus all the mint green colored dishes. - The porcelain dining wear ranged from looking new to so old all of the gold was rubbed off on the plates. - It's a little loud inside here with all the people eating and talking. {FOOD}- All you can eat / drink. Just call the waiter over and ask for refills on whatever you want and they'll come back with it. - They have several different set types - Afternoon Tea, High Tea & Savory Tea. Your party is allowed to order different sets and SHARE them within each other so that you can try out everything :) AND free refills! What a deal. - Parties of 3: 90 minute limit- Parties of 4+: 2 hour limit. - You're also allowed to TAKE FOOD HOME! You're only allowed to take certain types of foods home due to some code. I couldn't take anything from my savory set other than the scones. But we could take the sweets from the afternoon tea set. You can also take the lemon curd / jam that they give you for the scones as well. - I found that the selection of food here wasn't as impressive as I've had before but it's very traditional tea foods. {RECOMMENDATIONS} - If you're feeling up for eating food food - I would order a high tea set. You get to choose a main course and get scones + tea + dessert along with it. My mother got the Lobster Omelette Victoria, Lobster Bisque & Shaved Truffle - and it was delicious. She raved that this was the best dish that we've eaten so far in London and will forever remember it.. okaay. It was pretty good. - Savory Afternoon Tea: I loved the Spinach & Parmesan Tartlet. Ordered like 6. - Afternoon Tea: I found this set to be a little overly sweet for my taste. - Cake Carriage: I loved the fact that you could try traditional British cakes (Victorian Sponge, Battenburg Cake) from their selection.- The Battenburg Cake looked so pretty - It's a square shaped, checkered pink and vanilla colored cake covered all over with marzipan. Now it tasted quite nasty though - just too much marzipan and the cake was strangely sweet tasting. Taking a picture was good enough for me.",
