I would give this a miss unless you are planning on spending a lot of hard cash!",

This one in St Katherine's Dock offers alfresco seating, much better to sit outside than inside it can get a bit inside during busy times. It has been a great experience when I last went for Lazy Sumday; seating outside by the water, great views of all the boats / yachts sunny day, great weather. And the food is good. It have got some salads, and vegetable dishes which are not available in usual Chinese restaurant hence a plus point for vege lovers! We spent about \u00a350 including drinks for two overall great value (only during Lazy Sumday though).",

However, I was most disappointed by the service; with so many waiters around I expected them to be more attentive, we had to ask 3 different people before we managed to get an extra place setting and a chair, as the largest table only seated 8. Also I had to wait a very long time for my drink to be served, despite ordering the food at the same time. When it did arrive I got a glass with a bead of green tea; there was no hot water with it!!! I had to ask especially for some so I could actually have a drink!!! When attempting to get the bill, I had to ask several different people before one came with the bill and when I wanted to pay, I felt I was ignored and despite asking to pay had to wait a further 10 minutes before someone came over.",

The crispy items were generally better than the steamed ones, which were all over-cooked to the point where the textures were ruined. We spent \u00a315 \u00a0(~$20) per person and weren't really full at the end. \u00a0They did offer an all you can eat option at \u00a323 per person but $30 per person is pretty ridiculous. \u00a0We would never spend that much in China town and leave hungry.",

    "text": "Tasty little parcels of dim sum heaven! For a chain restaurant, I think that a lot of the dishes taste quite authentic. Clay pots, steamed dumplings and spring rolls are just a few of the tasty dishes on this vast menu. There a few vegetarian dishes but not a lot which is why I have not given this a better rating. There are a choice of 3 set menus that have a variety of food which is well worth money.Why not compliment the dishes with a jug of hot sake. There is nothing like an alcoholic drink made from vegetables. ha ha. I think that the self order slip makes the whole experience a lot of better as you can't really complain to the waiter for messing up your order. You can also keep a track of what you have ordered and what left there is to try. The average number of dim sum orders would 3-4 per person. If your feeling greedy or just cant help yourself to try everything, go ahead, as you can take away what you don't finish.This branch is set on a quiet strip of restaurants right on St. Katherine's Dock with fantastic views of Tower Bridge. The restaurant is a lot smaller than other branches but cosy and intimate - so a great place to dine for an important business meeting. New items are added to the menu all the time and I always try them. If you do feel like wetting your taste buds with dim sum, Ping Pong is definitely the way to do it!",

I needed to eat (obviously) so I chose Ping Pong since I had never tried Dim Sum before.I think the concept of eating 4 or 5 small meals is a great idea. Sometimes you just cannot decide whether you would like a soup or something more \"meaty\". Dim Sum allows you to pick up a lot of different flavors and textures.In the end I would say the price is alright for the quality and the quantity. I had 4 meals, a big bottle of Tiger beer and it cost me \u00a325. Which is far from overpriced, if you consider the fact that I felt perfectly satiated. It's just that I was not that impressed by the flavors. It was OK but not breathtaking. I always expect a restaurant to give me very high quality products with very strong flavors and character so my rating might sound a little bit severe. I would recommend this place if you need to be sure there's great chance you and your family/friends are gonna like it for sure (no big suprises, food is correct) but I can't say it blew my mind.",

    "text": "I have to absolutely agree with Jujwaller - St Katherine's Dock is a hiding place for the busy bustling streets of London. I have been a complete passionate docks goer for the last 10 years after coming across it completely accidentally one afternoon when taking my Italian friends out for a bite. St Katherine's Dock is a marina for boats, fishing boats and luxury yachts. It is quite small and condensed, but is very pretty with penthouse apartments surrounding it and great bars and cafes around the wooden hanging bridges. I am now addicted to my summer Sunday reading afternoons, I pick up my usual from the little cafe and lay on the stone benches by the marina reading a easy going novel. It's absolutely gorgeous, especially summer nights when people are just hanging around on their boats, by the marina, drinking wine and just looking chillled.. It feels like I am a miles away from the bustling noisy capital.. I would definitely recommend the Indian restaurant Mala and the Dickens Inn (fish n'chips) and the Japanese restaurant at the far end of the harbour. Zizzi's and Cafe Rouge are the more usual hangouts for locals. I almost forgot to mention the medieval banquet on the corner of the harbour in Ivory House as well - I am not sure how much this costs nowadays but it is great fun again you can book these through the internet and get a much better discount.. In case of urgent need for a toilet - you could use the Tower Hotel adjacent to the harbour or there are some public toilets at the far end of the harbour on the corner near to the Starbucks - they are usually quite clean! So if you just want to get away from London for a bit - then remember St Katherines Dock is the place to visit!",

I love tapas, and tasting menus, so I love the dim sum concept because I can try so many different things. My boyfriend adored it the first time, and insisted on coming back. We sat out in the cold just so we could eat here again lol. (We ordered multiples of the asparagus!)I want to mention that the first time I came here, it was just my boyfriend and I, sitting by another couple that appeared to be on a date. The girl couldn't seem to find a wine she liked, so our amazing waiter offered to go next door to another restaurant to get a wine she would like. How is that for service?

If you walk along the pier of San Francisco or Portugal, you can see lots of yachts, but the fact that London isn't a coastal city, and these docks are right downtown, well, that's something to enjoy.Definitely recommend taking a stroll here, but don't make it your first stop if you are showing tourist friends around. I'd say make it one of your last stops, since they need to see and feel London, to appreciate the docks.",

It can get absolutely packed in the summer evenings at the end of the week - the crowd is mostly business/suits as it's a bit out of the way for tourists (even being just over the road from the tower!) My favourite places: Mala - best (and only!) Indian - really nice food, great service. Dickens Inn - go upstairs for pizza and sit on the balcony looking out over the boats. Ping Pong - often ignored, but actually very very good. usually the last restaurant to fill up.Cote - very reasonable and good quality. Go for a walk around the whole complex and you could do one course each at three/four different places! Definitely finish up at Cafe Rouge for pudding! Also, visit at night - it's stunningly pretty with all the lights on the trees and the boats.",

Having just finished the very last episode of The Tudors, we wanted to let the show live on by walking around the centrepiece of the show. As we walked under the Tower Bridge arches, not quite ready to head home, I saw a sign for the Docks in a little corner of the buildings. I convinced my partner to check it out with me, and we were amazed!The docks are now one of my favourite spots to walk around. With the exception of that hideous-looking hotel that overtakes the view of the bridge, the Docks are great to grab a coffee, sit down for dinner or walk around.",

The set menus and cocktails are great and St. Katharine's Dock is a wonderfully quiet place to an enjoy an afternoon. The main problem with this Ping Pong location is that the staff are not especially interested in customers. They take their time chatting amongst themselves before seating your or taking your order and all but disappear once the food arrives. Though the food is good, the poor level of service ruins the dining experience.",

Most will say, 'St. Katharine's Dock' but her true name is 'St. Katharine Docks.' See the difference? St. Katharine is her name with no claim or ownership to the docks themselves, unlike Henry's poor wife Kathryn H whom I believe very much did make her docks her own and wore them as her final accessory, I might add.Also, don't look like a numbty by doing your 'How to ind it\" research before you get there. If you've never been or haven't been in a while, it's easy to forget where it is. Take your significant other by the hand and walk them out of Tower Hill station, past the old city wall, down the underpass and burst out at the docks! What a legend! I can hear the brownie point tinkling in like a winning fruit machine in Vegas! Don't on the other hand, select this as a romantic meeting place for a first date if 1, your date has never been there before and 2, the London Olympic marathon happens to be running right past it, so all the surrounding roads are blocked off and a rather elaborate detour is in place, causing your perspective new beau to be 43 minutes late!",

    "text": "Was craving dumplings and decided to check out St. Katherine's Docks.Ping Pong was easy to find near the main restaurant area. Being a late lunch the place was empty. The restaurant was decorated nicely to celebrate Chinese New Year; year of the monkey.Staff were every helpful, asking if I had been to there restaurants before, when I said I hadn't they kindly explained how the ordering works and recommends number of dishes to have per person. I decided to go with go with there Ping Pong Selection set menu, which had a selections for fried and steamed dumplings plus a rice dish. It was heaps of food and satisfied my craving. Food was well presented and each item was explained when delivered. All was delicious, my favourite was the potato and edamame cake. What stole the show was the flowering tea. I was fascinated by the dry tea leaves come to life in the boiling water become a stunning piece of art. Good food, fascinating tea and very attentive service will defiantly go back.",

    "text": "I like Ping Pong. \u00a0I've been to three different locations of theirs and each has it own vibe. \u00a0This one overlooks the boats of St. Katherine's dock and has a heated outdoor seating area. \u00a0I've been here on both a lazy Sunday afternoon and more recently a very late Friday night. Service 3-4 stars: The service did it's best on Friday - but were clearly overwhelmed. \u00a0Everyone at every table around me had to ask what had happened to their food after more than a half hour wait. \u00a0They knew they were in the weeds though - and provided me a coupon for a free cocktail for my next visit (and they have quite a selection of exotic ones). They also ran out of chili sauce (a staple) that evening. On a lazy Sunday it was much better - even though that's the day they offer unlimited Dim Sum for 22 quid. Can't eat that much - but, many around me were enjoying it.Food: 3-4 stars: Largely depends upon what you get. \u00a0I've had the set menu for 1, shared the set menu for 2 and have finally decided what I like and don't like - so, it's a better deal for me to just order a la carte now. \u00a0Do recommend the set menu for first-timers. \u00a0Here are my favorites: Prawn toast, squid ink seafood dumplings, chive and shrimp dumplings, spicy soup made with coconut milk and brocolli with a yummy sauce and sesame seeds. \u00a0Least favorite: any of the rice dishes, the mushroom puff and the chicken dumplings. Atmosphere 3-4: Casual and good for everything from dates to hanging out with friends and family. \u00a0Offer an on-going student discount - so always a few of those around.Value: 3-4, again depending on what you like. \u00a0While many natives scoff at dim sum served by \u00a0 a chain - you can count on what you get maybe not being the best dim sum ever - but definitely consistently good.Bottom Line: \u00a0When that dim sum craving hits again, I'll go back here to get my fix - but, I'll avoid the busier times.",

Has a south of France feel (although probably a lot colder!) with the boats docked in the water and the array of restaurants to choose from. I'll definitely be back around here soon - although maybe more in the summer months!",

I can't comment on its main menu choices, but for a drink and a cake I'd definitely recommend a visit.We'd actually had lunch earlier but skipped dessert, so were specificially looking for sweet treats. I had a chocolate orange tart which was excellent - although, so chocolatey that I had to save half of it for when I got home! I also tried a bit of my Dad's Red Velvet cake which was pretty perfect, and my Mum's carrot cake has an ACTUAL ICING CARROT on top. The slice sizes for the cakes were really impressive, and the service was quick and easy. I'd definitely pay another visit to St Katharine Docks Cafe if I was in the area!",

    "text": "I guess this place is OK when you're too stretched to bother making a trip to China Palace @ Excel or Royal China Club out West. I suppose it's not the worst dim sum in London and it's convenient since Ping Pong is seemingly everywhere these days but the food itself is unimaginative.The decor and service is certainly much more inspired that most Chinese restaurants but the menu is very Westernised. Chicken in dumplings is not too common in China so I find it pretty weird. I understand pork is not as popular in the UK but having it as an option would be nice. Hot dishes, unless steamed, can arrive to the table lukewarm or cold. For the portions, I feel the price is on the higher side as it literally took a mountain of those steaming baskets to stack up on my table before I felt full.Their Sunday deals are very appealing. All you can eat and I think cocktails are somehow involved in the deal but I can't remember exactly how. For that I'm adding the third star. Otherwise this place gets two.",

The dishes are all small plates of dim sum, you usually get about 3 dumplings per serving so need to order several dishes per person. They have a standard menu and also seasonal specialities - when we went last week, the special lamb spring rolls were particularly good. Disappointingly, quite a few dishes (including some of the specials) had sold out. The dim sum we ordered were generally good and tasted quite fresh and flavoursome, however for the size of the portions it's a little expensive.",

UNTIL YESTERDAY!!!!the seats were limited so we had to sit near the dumpling steamer section.... Ended up with a free facial.I wasn't ravenous so despite their recommendations of 5 dishes minimum, I picked three.Let's start with the honey glazed chicken wings . Oh My. They were delicious! I never really expect much from chicken wings but honestly they were so good. Sweet sticky and salty. Yum.I tried their scallop and chive steamed dumplings which were so well seasoned I could've cry from pure joy!It's one of those places you spend \u00a320 at but kinda leave with room for more. But the flavours just may make me over look those factors.",

I decided to try this spot with my husband because of distance. The ambiance is quiet nice and pleasant servers however the food was just so bland and made with such low quality ingredients. Don't waste your time even bothering to try their food. We ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings and the vegetarian tasting menu. Not one thing has flavor. One of the options in the veggie menu was a tofu rice bowl and it had some broccoli in it that tasted like it was boiled for days. Gross!",
