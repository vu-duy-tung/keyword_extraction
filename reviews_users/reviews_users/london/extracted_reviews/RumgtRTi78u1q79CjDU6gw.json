The service was slick and I liked the attention to detail: interesting plates, heart-shaped spoons and pretty teapots.

My Tom Kha soup was very nice if a bit overloaded with ingredients for the small pot. Sea bream, which was one of the more expensive items on the menu did not impress at all. My friend's curry looked good though. Seafood dish (don't remember which one) also was ok. Plum wine is good if overpriced. The staff however isn't exactly attentive, I had to ask for everything at least twice. The place is also quite cramped, with no room to sit an extra person which is a problem if there are 3 or 5 of you. But very nice garden if you can fit in. I suggest calling in advance",

I haven't had a problem with slow service, as a couple of the reviews have mentioned, and really have no complaints at all. In fact, my wife and I moved from Islington to San Francisco a few years ago and still reminisce about one of Isarn's most remarkable features, the delectable item that is alone worth coming for: the warm raspberry and chocolate pudding with vanilla ice cream. It is ecstasy in dessert form. When you go to Isarn, do not miss this. We're moving back to London this summer, and Isarn will be the first stop on our list.",

I do recommend the crispy duck and palemo, it's like miniature thai duck tacos or lettuce wraps but with betel leaves instead of lettuce. The Beef and Holy Basil was also great, well spiced but not too spicy. The beef was fully cooked, but still tender and not at all chewy. Lot's of hidden chilies so be forewarned! I suggest getting the coconut sticky rice as a side. For take-away everything was packaged in nice plastic containers and was ready in less than 15 minutes.

I have never been asked by a waiter before if I have food allergies of any kind. \u00a0They asked everyone that. \u00a0I really appreciated that, being someone who used to have food allergies and feel silly having to indicate this to waiters and feel like a nuisance. \u00a0I placed my order, and instantly these crispy yummy chips of some type (not sure exactly what the flavor was) was placed on my table to enjoy prior to my meal coming out. This was standard and no additional cost to anyone ordering. \u00a0They were very good, and I couldn't stop chomping on them until they were gone. \u00a0I ordered the Chicken eggplant stir fry with Brown Jasmin Rice. The food was incredible, but WOW, the Brown rice was AMAZING! \u00a0I know it sounds crazy, but I have never had brown rice like that. \u00a0I order brown rice because it is healthier for you, but it has never tasted better than the white jasmine rice. \u00a0I always feel like I am having to order the second best rice. However, here the brown rice is incredible. \u00a0I wish I knew what type of rice it was and how they cooked it. \u00a0I would buy a bag of it and take it home! \u00a0Also, I had a glass of Kishu which was a plum wine that I have never seen before, and the waiter highly suggested. \u00a0It was very good and served chilled over ice. \u00a0I would definitely go back here again. \u00a0As you are sitting so close to your neighbors you can't help but overhear other conversations. There were several people who knew the menu backwards and forwards and mentioned that they came several times a week. \u00a0This is definitely a regular spot for locals. \u00a0If I lived nearby, it would definitely be a place I would be visiting often.",

The roasted duck red curry came with duck aplenty, which is more than can be said about the starter of crispy duck and pomelo served on betal leaf - which simply wasn't nice in any shape or form. The juices available were reminiscent of when I was in Thailand which was great, and the desserts were really very tasty - particularly the lemon cheesecake (yum!). Expect to pay between \u00a322-\u00a330 for three courses without alcohol. Pretty good value really. Great location along Upper Street too, which allows you to explore the numerous bars for the rest of the night.",

    "text": "A good Thai local for me with tasty traditional Thai cuisine. Thom Yam Goong, a spicy lemongrass infused soup with prawns is a great way to start off before you tuck into all the lovely mains. This highly spiced clear broth stings your lips, but goes down smoothly. Also, go for the salad of soft shell crab with mango dressing - the Thai's do their salads well, it's a pity they don't have the classic spicy beef salad though. Onto the mains, be sure to share with whoever you're with as that's usually the best way to enjoy asian food. Chicken green curry with sweet basil is always good, as is the roasted duck red curry, along side a vegetable dish of morning glory with chilli all works well together. Wash all these flavours down with their Thai Chang beer. I almost never leave without having mango with black sticky rice - my favourite Thai dessert.",

It was not super busy so we could seat wherever we wanted. My husband got the Massaman Curry and I chose the Prawn Pad Thai. Both were super flavorful and satisfying. We appreciated the iced tea at the end of our meal, it was a nice touch! We would love to stop by again to try other items from their menu.",

    "text": "\"A great authentic selection of Veg and Non-Veg menu with excellent service\"Date of Visit: 18.01.18Time: 12.30pmReview: Upper Street has one restaurant after another so you can easily get confused where to eat and you may not venture from one end to the other but i do recommend you plan and stick to your plan as we did else we would have not walked this far down (towards Highbury from Angle Tube) and would have walked past the small entrance no doubt and missed out on this little treasure. There are also special lunch deals which are very well grouped options and worth looking at. Menu selection is great with many options but not to the point you cant decide and also would then question the quality on offer. A good selection of starters, mains and desserts. Food all arrived promptly and hot and all well presented. I tried all the dishes and each had an authentic and different taste and enjoyed each one from the starters to the main to the dessert. Also having a selection of both veg and non-veg all great with no complaints. This is not supposed to be fine dinning or a fusion resturant but its one i would visit again as you know you and anyone you take with you will be happy and full.Dress Code: No dress code and a nice place to visit for family meal or with friends. Booking Process: You are able to book a table on-line very easy process and you get a confirmation email which all worked well. Location: 119 Upper Street, London N1 1QPCuisine type: Thai foodParking: There is off street parking but no dedicated car parkDecor & Lighting: We sat by the window but there is a rear part to the restaurant also flooded with light from a glass atrium and although the resturant starts narrow it really has considerable space further down. There is also some nice accent lighting and good comfortable seating with various seating options available to meet any size party.Heating & Cooling: I noted a few AC units which i assume also had heat pumps and we went the temperature was cold outside but comfortable inside. Ambience & Acoustics: Light background music and simple decor, i would say the walls could do with some work to add some more ambience but overall a nice place and clean. Acoustics seemed to be good but as we went when it was empty it would be unfair to really comment too much about noise levels. DB Level: I did not take a reading as we were the only people in the restaurant at the time so would not be relevantDrinks: There was a good selection of drinks with various teas and other fresh juices and a couple of cocktails on offer but no non-alcoholic selection but all you would expect and a little more available so there was no real issue. \u00a0We had the following: StartersCorn fritters with sweet chilli dressing - Comes with two good sized fritters, a bit on the sticky side for the teeth but great taste and not overly spicy and a great starter with the sweet chilli dressing also a good complimentary sauce. Spicy chicken and dill soup - A great fresh and spicy tasting broth with good amount of chicken.A big bowl for a starter.Vegetable spring roll - Mini spring rolls and little on the greasy side but all forgiven for the great taste and i could have eaten so many more of these.Vegetable thom yum - A great soup with plenty of vegatibiles and spicy slightly sweet broth. A big bowl for a starter.Main CourseVegetable green curry with Thai aubergine, tofu, bamboo shoot and sweet basil - A good sized portion again a nice spicy tasting broth with good consistency of sauce and serve with rice. We asked for this without tofu.Chicken stir fry with cashew nut - Served in a large bowl with plenty of spicy crispy chicken pieces so if you love crispy spicy chicken you will love this but not served with any noddles or rice so worth maybe ordering something to accompany this dish. Phad mee, egg noodle with chicken, prawn, shiitake and beansprout - \u00a0A good sized portion of egg noodles and chicken, which is similar to the stir fry but not as crispy. Very nice dish with plenty of flavour but a milder option than the others.DesertWarm raspberry and chocolate pudding with vanilla ice cream - Small but very hot raspberry and chocolate pudding but still a good size for dessert and not overly rich in taste with light raspberry taste so not overpowering. A nice vanilla ice cream that complimented the dessert well. A great end to the meal . Lemon cheesecake with strawberry ice cream - A light refreshing lemon cheesecake and fresh strawberry ice cream. Portion is not too big or too small and you can order two dishes and easily share each as i would recommend. Bill / Cost: Around \u00a350-60 for three people which i found extremely reasonable given the portion size and quality of food.Conclusion: Menu selection and service was excellent with great friendly staff who were also very attentive. Given we went at a day and time it was empty so i cannot comment on",

    "text": "Apparently, London's entire dining scene shuts down by 10 PM...this was news to me as a visiting foreigner. After hunting for a bite to eat for over 40 minutes, we stumbled upon this contemporary Thai gem and it turned out to be one of our best meals in the UK. The shotgun-style restaurant is long and narrow with dark wooden paneling and minimalist design. The service was warm, friendly, and prompt. The real show-stopper, however, was the food:Char-grilled pork with chili, garlic, and lime - The best dish we ordered. Simultaneously tangy, spicy, and remarkably tender, the meat just overwhelms your taste buds (in a good way).Chicken stir fry with cashews - The chicken was well-seasoned and the variety of textures in the dish balanced nicely. Nonetheless, this was probably the most forgettable dish of the lot.Crispy duck served with pancakes - Pancakes is somewhat of a misnomer; they were actually thin, stretchy tortillas. With a thick, crispy exterior and soft center, the large slices of duck were incredible.Salt and pepper squid - Simple yet delicious, with a spicy-savory kick.Monkfish green curry - A hot, fragrant curry with strong notes of ginger and basil. The chewy eggplant and soft fish really absorb the bountiful flavors of the dish.With some phenomenal dishes and zero weak ones, Isarn is absolutely worth checking out whether your a local or outsider. Did I mention it's open til midnight?",

I ordered a tom yum soup to start which was tasty but was also full of woody chunks of ginger and lemongrass. And it had some green beans which were about 4 inches long and really awkward to eat with a spoon. The mains were ok too but I got a green curry and you have to order rice separately, but then it comes in a huge portion which is probably meant for two but then my wife ordered pad Thai and didn't need rice so we barely made a dent. Everything just seemed a bit off. The staff was ok but it doesn't feel like a family run place just another Upper Street trap. This used to be our go to Thai place in the area but now I think it's pretty average and we'll try to find someplace new.",

After not having great experiences with Asian food in Islington, I was pleasantly surprised by Isarn! The food was VERY well priced yet we got great food.. my coworker and I REALLY enjoyed the roasted duck red curry. The place was a little empty for a Friday afternoon but it could've potentially been due to the distance north it was on Upper St away from the businesses or the construction that was going on in their backyard patio area. Either way, this is a gem of a place with very friendly servers and great food at a reasonable price. Don't know what it's like for dinner but I would GREATLY recommend it for lunch!",

We've been away from Upper Street for a few years now and Isarn randomly popped into my head so off we went.I was pleased to find it still in the same spot and identical to last time we ventured in. A fairly classic order of Pad Thai and Salt and Pepper squid for me, and the other half had a craving for veg so got a Spinach and Pumpkin dish and a Tofu with yellow bean sauce. The food was just as good as it was the last time we went. Everything just absolutely delicious and it all came out nice and fast.The service is a bit hit and miss and we found it hard to get anyone's attention even though where we were sitting at the back there was only 3 tables occupied.Something else I found odd was that the waitress asked us if we wanted her to take away our glasses which had been sat empty for half an hour. I'd have ordered another drink if I'd been asked but just drank tap water through the meal instead. Upsell dudes, you almost got 2 lime juice sodas out of me!Oh yeah and something else I can recommend enough is their chocolate and raspberry pudding with vanilla ice cream. Absolutely the most perfect dessert and well worth the 15 minute wait. I'd come back again just for this.Thanks Isarn!",

Sadly the service was a real let down - whether it was a particularly busy Friday eve I'm not sure, but it took a while to even get menus let alone have our order taken. 45mins later, stomachs growling, we considered walking out but were assured our food was 'on its way'. If that was true then the kitchen must have been a mile up the road by the time our food arrived!By then I could have eaten the decorative banana leaves I was so hungry, but to their credit the food was tasty and flavourful, and it's reasonably priced too. I really liked the look of the place and all the deep purples in the colour scheme - though the long narrow shape of the room is a little impractical so check for incoming traffic before deciding to pop to the loo.Maybe we were just unlucky, but the staff seemed fairly uncaring at our long wait so sadly I wasn't left feeling the warm and fuzzies for this place.",

    "text": "I gotta give it to Isarn for making pretty damn good Thai food. The atmosphere is lovely and although the food is catered more towards non-Asians, that's alright. I came here last night around 8:30PM and only about half the restaurant was filled up. After breezing through the menu, I decided on getting myself the Papaya Salad with Satay Chicken and the Pad Thai for my main. First up to bat were appetizing prawn crackers and my friend and I nibbled on these until our starters came. He got the 1/4 Crispy Duck while I had my Papaya Salad. Crispy duck was good, but not really one of my favorite things. The papaya salad was unlike any I've ever had before. The chunks of papaya were thick cut and the sauce it was in was thicker than what I was used to. I've also never had it with chicken before, it's usually crab or no meat at all. Although it wasn't the traditional type I'm used to, it had great flavor and a nice spicy kick to it. I actually really enjoyed it and as I'm typing this review up right now, my mouth is watering for it. I guess that's saying something.For my main, I got the beloved Pad Thai. So, I like to say that you can judge a restaurant based on the quality of its Pad Thai. It's a very popular dish and if a restaurant can't get this right, they've got themselves a problem. Isarn happened to make a fantastic Pad Thai. It was the right flavor and consistency and I may even go as far to say that it's the best I've had in London. Isarn has passed the Pad Thai test.My friend got the Cashew Chicken with Egg Fried Rice which was actually very good as well. I'm glad I found a new place to get my Thai food fix here in London. It may not be entirely traditional, but the twist they add to traditional dishes is done well.",

The store front is unassuming but the inside is quite spacious and nicely decorated. I consider the prices to be \u00a0bargin considering the quality of the food and the environment. I ordered the set lunch (Vegetable Green Curry) for 6.95 and the Pad Thai (with prawn and chives) for 9. Both dishes were flavorful- the curry had the right amount of spice and the Pad Thai struck the right balance between salty, sour, and sweet notes.In truth, the food and decor warrant a solid 4-star review. However, the excellent service earned Isarn another star. There was an issue with my order due to miscommunications (as least partially my fault) where I was charged for 2 sets of the same dishes for both dine-in and take out. Once I spoke with the manager/ owner, this issue was quickly resolved. Tip-For my fellow Americans, the Brits do takeout (or take-away) a little differently, so always ask, don't assume!",

    "text": "Happy to have found this place open during the long 4 day weekend. We got in half an hour before the lunch special was over which is usually between 12-3pm. At this time they serve set lunch almost like the japanese bento box. In my box, I had vegetable curry which came with 2 little apring rolls, jasmine rice and big chunk of watermelon. My husband on the other hand had the spicy quid, thom yom soup with mushroom, jasmine rice and the chunky sliced watermelon. I must say that both our dishes were spicy but delicious. The portioning was also generous for a mere \u00a36.90 a set. My husband also had the blended watermelon juice, which he described as nice and refreshing to finish off the meal.As for the decor, this place is clean and modernly embellished. Ohhh the thai/zen music on the background lulls you through your meal. Hands off to this place for the impeccable service from entry to exit. Just smiles all the way from all the staff. Great place for sure. I cant wait to go back for more.",

Whether you like your meat or are vegetarian, you will find something to suit your tastes in the menu. We chose a selection of starters including the traditional chicken satay and nems with papayas. It was all delicious ! The mains didn't disappoint either with a tasty seabass and a veggie pad thai. If you are wandering around Angel and are looking for a nice Thai restaurant in the area, I would strongly recommend this place.",

It even came with a slice of watermelon :) I have nothing bad to say about Isarn. The atmosphere was great -- nice enough to feel like you're out for a nice meal, but comfortable as well. The staff were even friendly. I don't know why I haven't been back yet. This place is GREAT!",

    "text": "This is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in London. I love coming here in the summer, especially in the outdoor area they have in the back (which covers up like Wimbledon when it starts to rain :), you gotta love London). Staff are super-uber friendly, with genuine smiles, and a desire to please. The food is very good, although some dishes are hit and miss. I always recommend the crispy duck in betel leaf, but lately, it's been coming over loaded with shredded coconut, so it gets in the way of the tasty goodness that's supposed to be inside. Otherwise, the monk fish green curry is amaze balls, and that green curry sauce is addictive, I tend to finish it off my simply drinking it straight from the bowl. I know, I should watch my manners, but what the hell.The chicken satay is ok, nothing to write home about, but it's good, don't get me wrong... I just think it's a hard dish to mess up, and this one doesn't distinguish itself from others I've had.I do love the chicken green papaya salad... my wife thinks that they might be a bit too liberal using fish sauce in the dressing, but I love my green papaya salads hot, spicy, and pungent. So should you.The surprise dish here is the char-grilled pork with chilli, garlic and lime. This is a delectable dish, and will have you lick your plate, and fight for the last remaining piece. Perfectly grilled, super tasty, spicy, and highly addictive.The baked seabass in thai herb is served wrapped in a banana leaf... and is so tender, flavourful, and aromatic that you're nostrils will be flaring with orgasmic pleasure :) Highly recommended dish.I'd avoid the sea bream... it sounds nice on the menu \"sea bream with kaffir lime leaf and red curry\", but the fish is too salty for my taste. I think it's a personal thing, so don't take my word for it... it all depends on how you roll with fish...Wine-wise... I highly recommend the 24\u00a3 Cote de Provence, marries well with most of the food, and is refreshing enough to cool you down on a hot summer night with hot thai food.One of my favourite places on Upper St. I take everyone I know here. And so should you.",
