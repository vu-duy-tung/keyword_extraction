Superb atmosphere - the 'mise en scene' is perfect - wonderful lighting, making women look more beautiful, the freshest of fresh ingredients used in deceptively simple dishes, charming and attractive staff and - until recent illness - the constant presence of one of the founders to ensure its standards never drop. The tables are bit close together and the hubub almost engulfs the room in the late evening (it's never less than totally full), and if you are seated too close to the open fire it can be a bit warm.but these are quibbles. Take your fullest wallet, your prettiest friends and a taxi (because you won't find it if you try and drive there and you want more of that delicious Pinot Bianco and a grappa to finish off with).",

    "text": "Please note that I dined at the River Caf\u00e9 prior to the fire so I'm not sure how much of this review will be relevant after the refurb. The Financial Times ran a promotion that allowed you to dine for \u00a320 for a 2-course lunch. Considering that dishes at The River Cafe average about \u00a311-\u00a312 for antipasti and primi meals and \u00a327-\u00a330 for secondi meals and even factoring in that we were likely to get a reduced fixed set meal the offer was a very good bargain. The ingredients in our meals were obviously of high quality but I felt that it was a little over-valued for very simple dishes. I couldn't complain at all about the service we received at The River Cafe - it was impeccable from start to finish. They have more than enough staff to cover staff who are otherwise occupied - from what seemed like more than ten chefs and assorted helpers in the kitchen, to the multitude of waiters in the restaurant to the multiple staff at the front desks so no diner was ever left out on a limb. The attention we received at lunch was perfect. The restaurant ambience was very buzzy - the high roof top meant that it was very noisy from the chatter in the restaurant and therefore surrounded us with a pulsing atmosphere. The restaurant is long with the kitchen/bar running down one side which allows the diners to have some sort of involvement in their meal. In all honesty this is exactly the type of restaurant that food critics live for - simple food with complicated descriptions and sky-high prices. Almost the opposite of what I prefer.",

A publication actually voted this the best Italian restaurant in the world which is of course a total disgrace. The food here is not bad and ingredients are generally well chosen . I guess because in general Italian restaurants in London or the UK are average to poor the River Cafe has thrived. The food is not a patch or the recently opened L'Anima in the City or Locanda Locatelli and Enonteca Tui. And if you are looking for pastiche I recommend Petersham Nurseries !",

It's not easy to get a table, it does required some planning but lunch is a better bet than evenings or weekends. It's a good place for a business lunch or if you want a good natter with friends. The location isn't particularly good for central London - you'll need a cab otherwise it's a hike from the nearest tube and parking around the place is rubbish as it's all residential. However, once you're there you won't be disappointed. River Cafe is famous for its fresh, seasonal, organic ingredients. The menu changes regularly and offers beautiful pastas and interesting dishes. The bread and olive oil served complimentary was wonderful - we ordered several baskets! I've never been here in Summer, but the large glass doors and patio area overlooking the Thames would be lovely on a warm day.",

    "text": "A friend visiting London wanted to eat at a Michelin starred place and I took advantage of his request to look for one that I hadn't visited before and soon zeroed in on the River Cafe. However as we walked towards the restaurant from Hammersmith station one bright Sunday afternoon, I almost began to regret my choice as the locality turned progressively shabbier. However the last turn to the restaurant was a big surprise. It was a huge place with as much seating outside as inside. The front opened into a garden, which had tables and a playing area for the younger guests, and which was right on the bank of the Thames. It looked beautiful. The lunch became very enjoyable just because of the ambience. We were in a good mood already and my friend decided to experiment with his food (I typically don't experiment with new meats at high end restaurants, but only with new dishes). For starters we shared an antipasti that was prepared with figs. It seemed an odd accompaniment for ham, but we enjoyed it nevertheless. We went for two dishes for our main course ... A small one from the \"primi\" section and a larger one from the \"secondi\" section of the menu. \u00a0The penne pasta was fabulous. One of the better ones that I have had. However my friend made an error of judgment when he ordered the full grouse. It was quite ok ... But since it came with bones, it was somewhat difficult to handle. Besides it had a very heavy flavour ... and was cooked quite rare. Also my friend expected it to be a white meat dish which it wasn't. So he was unable to enjoy this dish as much as it should have been enjoyed. River Cafe, like most establishments in its class, had a somewhat limited choice of wines by the glass. But our waiter made some good suggestions and we liked out drinks. The disappointment of the main course was more than made up for by the desserts. I had a conventional dish ... Vanilla ice cream with whiskey. It cost ~\u00a39. However the amount of whiskey they served (it was provided in a separate glass) was more than a standard double. The price was worth it just because of this. My friend ordered our favourite item of the afternoon ... Zabaglione custard. This was my first taste of this Italian dessert that is made with eggs and wine. It was divine. The taste has stuck to my mouth. \u00a0I shall return just for having this dessert again :)It's an expensive restaurant (as we expected it to be). We paid around \u00a370 per person for our meal. But it's awesome ambience and service makes it preferable to a number of other restaurants in its league.",

    "text": "For a more detailed review and pictures please refer to hungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  River Cafe in Hammersmith has been opened in 1987, received a Michelin star in 1988 and has been an institution of the London restaurant scene ever since. A place every serious London foodie should visit at least once I finally made it there for a delightful Sunday lunch on a perfect sunny autumn day. The restaurant is difficult to find with a rather inconspicuous sign which is easy to overlook. If it hadn't been for Ed Miliband standing in front and welcoming guests for his luncheon (NB: not me) \u00a0I would probably still be searching. It is good to know that our politicians appreciate good food, I wonder if this should influence my decision who to vote for? Back to the River Cafe. As the name promises, it is located close to the shore of the River Thames, overlooking a greener than green lovely garden. I very much liked the atmosphere. It does have a Michelin star yes, but it is devoid of the pretentiousness that is often associated with fine dining restaurants. It is stylish but not over the top and I liked the busy, open kitchen and the big oven. This concept seems to attract a rather mixed crowed \u00a0young and elderly couples, families and groups of friends. In addition it needs to be pointed out that they get my award (that I have just introduced) for the most sexy and best dressed waiters and waitresses. Ladies, go their nicely made up otherwise you might not have your partners full attention ( believe me, I speak from my own experience). Unfortunately the presentation of the food was not half as convincing. Don't get me wrong, it all tasted very good, it just could have looked a bit prettier. Considering their prices you would expect distilled beauty on your plate actually. I really liked the food but I was not blown away by any of the dishes. But maybe this was this is what River Cafe stands for \u00a0solid quality without major experiments and I actually left River Cafe perfectly content. We started with Insalata di Polpo (13). Perfectly soft and well seasoned octopus generously drizzled with flavoursome high-quality olive oil and potatoes. I really enjoyed it but- you might agree with me \u00a0it was just not a very good looking plate of food. The Insalata con Bortolotti (12) was absolutely delicious. The green salad consisted of a myriad of different kinds of fresh leaves and herbs interspersed with the warm beans and tasted heavenly. For the mains we went for one primi and one secondi: The Tagliarini con Granchio (15) were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce hat a pleasant spiciness to it which worked well with the sweetness of the crab. Fresh dill nicely complemented this flawless dish. The Branzino al Cartoccio (35) however was horrendously overpriced. It was really nice, but I don't know how nice food must be to make you feel it is worth 35 pounds? The fish was of very good quality and cooked to perfection, it came on a bed of well-seasoned Swiss chard and fresh porcini. I would have happily paid, let's say 22 pounds for it. I struggle with the 35 though. And if you say why do you choose such an expensive main, then I have to tell you that there was not a single secondi under 30 pounds! We could not resist ordering the cheese platter (12) with a choice of 3 cheeses (sorry Chocolate Nemesis, next time!). Each of the three cheeses was utterly delicious and the serving was generous, more than enough for 2 people. In summary I should point out that the green light for River Cafe was a tough decision. It is too expensive for what they offer in my opinion. What tipped it in the end was that you CAN get away with a decently prized meal of very good quality: the starters and primi \u00a0even though not cheap \u00a0were not outrageous and they have a choice of wines under 20 pounds available.",

    "text": "Difficult to find somewhere between Fulham and Hammersmith the River Cafe is located in an unlikely street full of warehouses. I did not know what to expect when walking in, and I have to admit I was amazed. It looks breathtakingly good, I have never really felt so struck with a restaurant's appearance before. After being gutted by fire last year, it was designed by one of head chef's husbands posh architect Richard Rogers. V.handy. The restaurant is beautiful but modern, and lined by a very long bar with a serene shade of blue behind it. The length of the room somewhat reminds a ship. At the very end is a projection of a clock and an open kitchen with a blazing wood fire oven. The staff were a great in helping to choose dishes without being too pushy, they didn't rush us and were on just the right side of friendly.The food was of course excellent. The most unpopular dish we ordered was the risotto, which I have to admit didn't look very appetising. A few on my table were rather put off, as the presentation made it appear as if it was found on a street corner. The ravioli primi, turbot secondi and panacotta with pomegranate desert we ate were all perfect. Definitely the best pasta I've ever eaten.This is the first restaurant I've been to in my life that offers valet car parking, and my my, the driver was so lovely that he even moved the seats forward so we could get back in the car easier on the way out.This was definitely the cream of my birthday-related activities crop so far. The atmosphere was as rich as the food, and the evening was very special. This is a fantastic place to mark an occasion.I imagine this is a great place for celebrity spotting, not that it's particularly cool to admit that. Mick Jagger dined here last night, with his very tall lady, and someone who looked a lot like Phillip Green. I am glad to note that it wasn't just us who couldn't resist a not so sneaky peak/gawk at his table. However I bet the staff are too c'leb hardened and unfazed to make any 'brown sugar' with your coffee gags. Well expensive but definitely worth saving for a visit.",

Nobody should get to experience this too often.This is a class act in every respect. Great location, stunning interior, beautiful menu, great ingredients, brilliant kitchen staff, friendly attentive waiting staff...The restaurant continues to maintain the highest of standards even though one of the founders has gone to eat her own food daily up in heaven.Packed to the rafters when we took my thoroughly deserving aunt, long suffering missus and the little scamp we were lucky enough to be able to stroll down via the river from our home in hammersmith. We are lucky enough to have an abundance of brilliant restaurants in this neck of the woods but frankly the river cafe is a national treasure, not a local one.The crowd in here is affluent but relaxed, sharing in the joy if the place. I bring the tone down but nobody notices. The place buzzes with excitement. Visually it's a one off. Modern inside and out, spacious, bright with sweeping curves and boaty colour scheme apt for it's riverside setting.The dramatic bar laden with raw ingredients the place has always been famed for. It sets the tone. Then at the back, the open plan kitchen so you can observe the hoards of staff going about making the best food this side of the Greenwich meridian. And that absolutely humungous wood fired oven. It's all so cool, for want of a better word. But not shoreditch cool. This is effortless.The menu. Pure Italian. Pure simplicity. A big selection of antipasti, second and primi. Something for everyone.Even the bread and olive oil is great. The olive oil tastes of apple. The bread beautifully sour.Carpaccio of sea bass for me to start. Beautiful to look at. Dressed perfectly. Wonderful fresh taste. Winner. Deb had squid with chilli and rocket. I have to say, for 5 stars, this was the only slight disappointment, it felt a bit understaffed and dry. But the squid again was perfect. Aunt had crostini, each one a little gem. The scamp tucked into the gorgeous bread and had tasters of all ours.I had calves liver for my main. Perfect. Just perfect. Deb had pasta. But check this out. She couldn't choose between the last of the season morel linuini and the beef Ragu. So the waitress suggested she have both, a half and half plate. We thout she was joking. But she wasn't. What fun. This is a serious restaurant, but with a lightness of touch. Neither dish disappointed. Unforgivably I can't remember what aunt had but I guarantee it was delectable. And the scamp had a main of lamb which they serve simplified for children and half price. It was ever so tasty but could maybe have had some greens to accompany the gorgeous fried potato.We couldn't fit in puddings but the scamp had ice cream in a cone. I can't comment on said ice cream's quality, I didn't get a look in.We washed it all down with a bottle recommended by the helpful friendly sommelier and could have stayed all afternoon. In fact we nearly did.You hold your breath for the bill, of that there's no doubt. But this place is worth every penny. Confident enough to do simple things brilliantly in fine surroundings with relaxed staff. Just an absolute treat. If there are any dining experiences in London that beat this for laid back elegance, I've not been there yet.Truly great stuff. I'm already planning next year's trip.",

    "text": "This place got a lot of press in US after it's re-furb, so I decided to give it a try during my last jaunt to blighty. It's a quality restaurant, with a very cool looking room and excellent service. BUT I didn't think it matched the hype. For starters, and this is no fault of the establishment, but the dining room was a bit of a \"scene\". \u00a0There was a lot of air kissing and flaunting of diamond crusted watches. It was a little much for me.I enjoyed my food for the most part. Personally, I felt the portions were too large - which, while justifying the hefty price tag, made exploring the menu prohibitive. I started with a pasta and shared an entree and I was very full. My husband went for three courses and he couldn't touch the cheese I ordered for dessert. On the menu I'd recommend the pastas and anything from the wood fired oven. The cheese selection is also very nice. Also, the sommelier was great in helping us choose a reasonable but tasty wine, so ask for help in choosing a bottle. All that being said, I think there are better options in central London...",

(They actually change their menu DAILY based on ingredients!)The cafe itself is designed by the owner's husband, whose office is right next to the restaurant along the river. When the weather permits its obviously best to sit outside and enjoy the view, but the interior is also cool and casual with the huge wood burning oven and exposed industrial furnishings. Service is super friendly and knowledgable. Best things to have here is anything that comes from the wood burning oven( the turbot was to die for), the lemon tart, and the chocolate nemisis. (probably the best chocolate cake in the world!)",

    "text": "I guess like a lot of folk The River Cafe, along with The Fat Duck, has been on our wish list for what seems like an age. The lovely weather at the end of March, the chance of a cheeky Friday off work and a little cash left in the bank meant that a long awaited pleasure could finally be realised. The short trek, no more than 15 minutes at an ambling pace, along the Thames Path from the tube station is a nice enough way to arrive at the restaurant although I'm not sure the majority of punters would find this to their taste \u00a0we didn't spot many of the walking classes on our visit. When we arrived around 2pm we found that the gods were really looking after us when we were offered the choice of a table inside or one on the terrace which had a little shade to protect from the early Spring sun which was out in full force. It was a no brainer. If you are lucky enough to turn up on a sunny day and can bag a table on the terrace this is the place to be \u00a0the inside space is fine but I found it a bit uninspiring and lacking in vibe. It put me in mind of a canteen space \u00a0not surprising really as that was its original function for the architectural practise next door. Once we were seated some very fine bread and the good looking paper menu arrived without much delay. We were eating from the set lunch menu, four courses for \u00a339, which had plenty of mouth watering dishes on offer (much better than the choice of 2 starters and 2 mains which is what you often find on the set menu in high end places). After a bit of banter with the young, friendly waiting staff we felt we had enough information to go on and made our orders (when you have been waiting this long to go to a restaurant it can be a bit nerve racking making a choice \u00a0the last thing you want is to blow it and find you have a bad case of the dreaded food envy). Perhaps it was the sunny day and the fine white wine from Sicily that we were drinking but this was a meal to savour from beginning to end. My lovely antipasti of chargrilled squid with chilli and rocket was tasty and perfectly cooked but was put into the shade by B's choice of prosciutto with smashed broad bean bruschetta which was just wonderful. Things got even better with the primi plates; my agnoli with rabbit, bay and pieropan soave was a dish to die for and the risotto con asparagi was simple yet delicately cooked and seasoned. The secondi had been recommended by our lovely waitress and did not fail to deliver: the Cornish monkfish with slow cooked fennel and rocket was perfection and the beef sirloin with salsa verde, cannellini beans and roasted medina tomatoes was a meat lovers paradise. Despite being stuffed by this point we took a bit of a breather to finish our wine and soak up the atmosphere \u00a0service had almost finished and most of the staff had decamped from the kitchen to sit outside and devour a well earned late lunch. Their energetic and engaging conversations made a nice contrast to the two very well groomed ladies sitting next to us who had spent a couple of hours discussing central London house prices and their next rental investments. After this short break we pressed on with some tart: pear and almond for me and lemon for B. Both were very tasty and went down well but if you are on a budget or have a small appetite my advice would be to have the antipasti and skip the dolci. By the time we had finished our coffee it was gone 5pm, the sun was starting to lose its heat and the journey home beckoned. The bill was not cheap but compared to the a la carte menu it was a bargain. I'm not sure that I would have found this such a delightful meal if I had been dining at full price, inside the restaurant, in the evening but I would recommend this for a lunch date without hesitation to anyone who has a love of good food.",

Filled with interesting, media types, and celebrities (saw Jade Jagger having a ciggie outside); and with a buzzing atmosphere even on a quiet Tuesday night, we were treated like kings and ate a wonderfully simple, fresh, seasonal, Tuscan feast. Perhaps not as delicate or intricate as Chez Bruce or Pied a Terre, this is great Italian dining. You are given a choice of antipasti, primi, and/or secondi, followed by amazing organic cheese or dessert. I chose as primi the risotto with langoustines, mint, peas and pinot bianco which was simple and delicious. For secondi I had the anjou pigeon which was delicious and heavy, but next time I'd go for the great-sounding fish \u00a0chargrilled cornish monkfish, turbot tranche, dorset blue lobster. My friend's boss treated us to a bottle of champers as he had to work late so the rest of the bill was good value \u00a0about \u00a375 each for 3 courses and a glass of wine with our cheese.",

The staff was accommodating of my gluten intolerance (I had warned them ahead of time, but it did take a few extra minutes for the chefs to discuss among themselves). They were willing to make anything on the menu for me with the exception of pasta dishes. For an appetizer I ordered a buffalo mozzarella salad. Usually these salads are layers of tomato, basil and mozzarella. Instead, I received a bean, tomato and olive salad with grilled pumpkin and a one pound ball of mozzarella. My husband ordered a crab salad with polenta and tomatoes. He used some of my massive ball of mozzarella to eat his tomatoes because I had plenty to share.For dinner I ordered a whole Dover sole and my husband had ravioli with ricotta and mushrooms. Our dessert consisted of some awesome gelato.",

She said that we should try it where it originally came from and It didn't take much convincing after where we found ourselves heading to The River Cafe.With the sun shining and kids and people enjoying the al fresco seating outside, you couldn't help but be in a jolly mood. Exuding an antipodean cafe vibe, we were relaxed and in a good mood.Overall, each dish was tasty and the flavours were clean and balanced though it wasn't brilliant. For the prices charged, I would expect it to be justified by either the ingredients to be of really good quality that simplicity cooking is used to allow the natural flavours to sing through or cooking techniques and flavours were paired for something delicious. It was neither for me.We now arrived at desserts and the infamous chocolate nemesis was ordered amongst others.I have to say that Ms. Chocoholic's description sounded better than it tasted.",

    "text": "Haven't eaten here in years but wanted to go back for AGES. Rocked up in the car and the valet beckoned me in and took care of the parking. Mid-week, room was bustling. We had a 9PM reservation but were ready to sit us, despite turning up half an hour early. Daily menu was composed of imaginative and well thought out dishes. Cheap River Cafe is not with starters averaging out at \u00a314 and mains up to \u00a335. But I went for the whole nine yards with an Agretti dish followed by a sort of ravioli in ball format and chocolate nemesis. Oh boy. Tasted as good as I remember it. Service was in a league of its own. Waitress friendly, attentive and extremely knowledgeable on all the dishes and advising my friend who had prosciutto, blood orange and fennel to start and veal with a lemon infused risotto as her main, washed down with a dessert wine (as recommended by aforementioned waitress). As we got our coats at the front desk, the valet was already drawing our car to the front door.Five out of five, surely for a great fine dining experience. Rose Gray would have been proud of how the River Cafe continues to stand the test of time.",

    "text": "My beloved took me here last night and my tastebuds spoiled, spanked and taken to the depths of foodgasms I never knew possible. This was the culinary equivalent of a dirty weekend. For a start it had a slightly strange location and was slightly out of the way and the surrounding streets were full of net curtains... For the last 11 years The River Cafe has been on my list of places I have wanted to visit but have just never got round to doing. Now this has changed and I feel the restaurant more than lives up to it's numerous books and prestige that seems to go with it. I love the fact that they are seasonal with the food and everyday the menu changes so it is a bit of pot luck as to what you will get, but there is definitely something for everyone, provided you like food that is and don't have any issues with gluten (well for the primi section anyhow). To start with we had a Lampone, which was Prosecco with fresh raspberries blended in it. To say it was divine would be an understatement. The tartness of the fruit worked well against the sweetness of the Prosecco perfectly. To start with I had the Chargrilled Squid with Chilli and Fresh Rocket. OMG I nearly died when I ate this. The smoky sweetness from the chargrilling of the squid was divine as was the subtle chilli heat. A squeeze of lemon helped activate all of these flavours all the more and the peppery rocket left a clean taste in the mouth afterwards. I liked that it was a generous serving too as one squid just wouldn't be enough given how lovely it tasted. My partner had some crab, which was served with aioli and zucchini. The crab was so fresh and clean tasting and the aioli wasn't too overpowering. It was rather subtle and I thought it had wild garlic in but I could be mistaken. The zucchini were quite sweet but cooked nicely and the olive oil used to dress them was very flavorful but not overpowering. There was less crab than there was squid but at the same time it was nice to be able to share both - although I think the squid rules (but then I would say that as I chose that as my starter) Instead of having secondi dishes which all looked very tantalising and tempting, especially the veal, we opted to have pasta as a next course. I had the Tagliatelle with Girolles and she had some linguini with olives and red mullet. Both of these dishes were simple but they were beautiful and so nice and pleasant on the palate to eat. My mushrooms were served with a simple butter, sage and parmesan sauce that literally dressed the plate, pasta cooked perfectly and the whole dish had a delicacy about it. The sage wasn't too overpowering either but left the sauce rich and unctuous enough to not become sickly. I have a small confession to make and that is I don't normally like Red Mullet very much. I feel it is one of those foods that became trendy in the early 90's and people say they 'love' it when in fact they just grin and bear it. I have been lucky enough to try it in some of the best restaurants too but by and large it doesn't do much for me. BUT after having a couple of mouthfuls of my partners linguine I found my opinion changed a little but that was because you could tell it was very fresh, every mouthful the fish had been cooked perfectly and left a lovely clean taste in the mouth as well as a lovely mouthful of firm, fleshed fish that that beautifully seasoned. I wouldn't order the mullet but would happily steal...I mean taste some from someone else's plate and I feel I now have a better relationship with it. To finish we shared the Chocolate Nemesis with a couple of glasses of Moscato which went together perfectly like Mozarella and Tomatoes. In a visit to the River Cafe I thought it couldn't be done without sampling the Chocolate Nemesis as I have heard and read so much about it and I would say you must have it if you go there. Forget all the usual excuses of \"I don't like chocolate\" \"I'm on a diet\" or I think \"I'll have some cheese\" these are rubbish excuses! For the record I am on a diet and I don't like chocolate much but if I am to choose a dessert containing chocolate then this is definitely the way to go and if you share you halve the calories! (Well that is the white lie I told myself) Still if you are going to go to such a wonderful restaurant such as The River Cafe your diet will go out of the window slightly. Although in it's defense I must add that I did step away feeling quite light and not like a beluga whale as I had imagined. Now the bill wasn't causing too much need to remortgage in a hurry but it's not cheap. Most Antipasti and Primi come in at \u00a315 and Secondi are mostly \u00a330 but you are paying for wonderful food that won't leave you feeling that you could have had better out of a jar of dolmio. I must warn you of one thing, Italian food is never going to be the same again after visiting here. Other than what you get in Italy itself of course. Service was friendly, and in some cases",

    "text": "Great expectations of eating here after surmounting considerable difficulties in getting a reservation ( only at 9.15 pm four weeks ahead). Weather not yet nice enough to eat outside, and tables inside were maximally packed. Full house on Friday meant almost unbearable noise, so much so I could not hear what the sweet waitress tried to communicate about menu dishes being out of stock. Nice, all Italian rustic menu, mostly northern Italy, little truffle, little risotto. Great, really great wine list and very knowledgable sommelier, but pricey, certainly for very average supermarket quality Montepulciano in carafe, that should have been 20 pounds instead of more than double that.Food was excellent, charcoal grilled calimari esp nice, home made fine, fresh ravioli recommended, HUGE portion turbot almost justifying its HUGE price, wonderful desserts. But 465 pounds for three as final bill requires much more comfortable seating, larger tables, more sophisticated dishes, and much better open wines for more decent prices. Go, if you want to splurge, on a warm evening, take a taxi or Uber for the 50 min ride from central London, take one bottle of wine and don't let them pour it out too quickly, share dishes and don't stuff yourselves on bread and olive oil that gets served first while you wait some 30 min for your appetisers!!",

    "text": "Matt B. and I went to the River Cafe for our anniversary dinner, and if I could do it again, I would pick somewhere else. \u00a0We still had a good time, but this was in spite of the restaurant.First of all, it was rather out of the way, and between the unreliable tube and the cab ride from the station, we almost missed our reservation. \u00a0This is a fairly minor complaint, I suppose. \u00a0My real gripe about River Cafe was the nonchalant and dismissive service. \u00a0We informed our waitress that it was our anniversary, and while we weren't expecting freebies, we didn't get so much as a candle in our desserts. \u00a0Instead, we got rushed service. \u00a0I understand the value of efficiency, but sometimes you want to sit back and enjoy a meal at leisure. \u00a0Anniversary meals must be high on that list of sometimes. \u00a0The River Cafe is an upscale and expensive place, but our food came faster than it did at Pizza Express. \u00a0We were done with our entrees exactly forty minutes after we sat down. \u00a0They slowed down the service after that, but in my opinion, the longest foodless interval of a meal should not be the wait for the check. \u00a0The space was nice, much larger and busier than we expected, so I suppose efficient service was a bit of a feat. \u00a0Still, there was no reason for it to be terse and impersonal we were paying so much for our meal.Much would have been forgiven, though, if the food had been amazing. \u00a0It was passable. \u00a0Bread was decent and came with good salt, pepper, and olive oil. \u00a0We ordered a nice bottle of erbaluce for \u00a329 - our waitress's recommendation when I asked for a wine in the \u00a320s.I was impressed by our starters, which at \u00a315 each cost about as much as our pastas. \u00a0Matt got the prosciutto di San Daniele, which came with two crostino of chicken liver and sage and squashed tomato and extra virgin olive oil. \u00a0I got the bresaola con Barba Bietole with red and gold beets and fresh horseradish. \u00a0Neither involved much preparation on the restaurant's part, but this was fine. \u00a0They were both delicious. \u00a0The prosciutto was of excellent quality and I enjoyed the heavy but tasty chicken liver. \u00a0The bresaola was wonderful, and the combination of beef with sweet beets and lightly pungent horseradish was exactly on point.I was sorely disappointed by the pasta. \u00a0I love pasta, and when it's done well, I can hardly think of anything better. \u00a0I was expecting delicious al dente homemade pasta from River Cafe, but what we got was actually rather flat. \u00a0I ordered the tagliarini con funghi, fresh fine pasta prepared with English porcini, cream, thyme, and parmesan. \u00a0The pasta lacked any bite, and the mushrooms were sliced so thin and cooked so much that they didn't have any flavor or texture left. \u00a0A hefty amount of garlic made the dish edible, but otherwise it was a bland disappointment. \u00a0Matt's panzotta di zucca was better. \u00a0This was fresh pasta stuffed with pumpkin and Buffalo ricotta with marjoram butter and pecorino. \u00a0It was essentially a pumpkin ravioli, and like nearly every other pumpkin ravioli I've come across, it tasted good. \u00a0It was not, however, anything special.Dessert was much better. \u00a0The chocolate nemesis was as sinful as its name suggests. \u00a0This was a lush, delicious flourless chocolate cake that was soft in texture like a shaped mousse. \u00a0The chocolate was great, and not too rich. \u00a0I also enjoyed the panna cotta with grappa and raspberries. \u00a0I love a good panna cotta, and this one was excellent, flecked with vanilla and boasting a perfect smooth creamy texture.Our dinner wasn't a disaster by any means, but it was one of our most expensive and least impressive date night meals. \u00a0There were some good moments, but the pasta was so lackluster and the service so disheartening that I don't think I can recommend the place. \u00a0On a side note, they did order us a cab, and when we met it outside it was an S class Mercedes. \u00a0We got stuck with an inflated rate, but I suppose it was a fun experience. \u00a0Like the River Cafe itself, though, it was probably not worth it.",

    "text": "I grew up in Italy so my standards for Italian food are pretty high. This place is awesome. I'd resisted going for the longest time because, well, I was sceptical (Ok, the truth is that I find Jamie Oliver kind of annoying and I associate this restaurant with him... Unacceptable reason, I know...)Went on Sat night a few weeks back. Tricky place to find. Luckily we don't live too far away so despite getting properly lost in the bowels of deepest, darkest Fulham we were not too late for our seating). \u00a0In any case the service was pleasing -- from maitresse d' to server to busboys -- so they probably would have kept our table.The menu is simple and simply prepared, almost rustic, Italian fare. I started with wood-roasted Scottish langoustines which arrived in a tangled oregano-fragranced heap. \u00a0Presentation is not high on the list here. \u00a0However, I spent a happy half-hour digging out the sweet flesh from the carapaces and claws -- it was awesome. \u00a0My dining partner had a simple seafood risotto which came 'in bianco', i.e. white with no tomato. \u00a0It was very well-executed and the seafood bits were cooked to perfection but I found it a little bland. \u00a0In Rome, where I grew up, risotto ai frutti di mare is always 'red' with a bite of chili.Mains were fine if a little 'meh'. \u00a0I had the stinco di vitello (veal shank) with polenta. \u00a0Again, very well-executed but a little unexciting. \u00a0My companion ordered the tagliata. \u00a0Ditto. \u00a0It was just a steak, afterall.The desserts were lovely. \u00a0The Chocolate Nemesis lived up to expectations: deeply unctuous and chocolately. \u00a0 The lemon tart was everything a lemon tart should be: sharp, sweet and soft, with pastry that's not too short.All in all a very good meal. \u00a0I'd love to make it my local but I'm afraid that my financial advisor may balk at the idea. \u00a0No matter what people say about paying for good food, River Cafe is very expensive for what you get.",

We knew in advance, that this would be a splurge meal both in price and quality of food.The location is a little far out from central London, and hard to find. We had a 7:15 reservation, but almost wish it was a little earlier. Within 30 minutes, this place was packed! It became very loud, and difficult to have a conversation. You can tell there is a loyal following here with regulars. Tables are in very close quarters to one another and small. We had a hard time placing everything on our table for 2, I couldn't imagine some of the small tables that had 6 people.Service was excellent. No complaints. We were treated very well; the staff was very knowledgeable about all the dishes and made recommendations. We never really had the same server. We had several that took care of us, and service never suffered despite being so busy.We started with some aperitifs, and had the appetizer - Scallops with greens. Excellent. Very nice preparation, and cooked perfectly. My only complaint - there was only 2.Next we moved onto the langoustine stuffed ravioli. I could have eaten another dish. Excellent.For mains, I had the bronzino/sea bass, served with roasted potatoes and tomatoes. It was cooked perfectly, good portion size. We also had the fillet, served with spinach and beans. Also cooked perfectly.For dessert, we shared Affogato. Espresso poured over gelato. \u00a0We weren't surprised by the price point as we knew it was going to be expensive. I would return on a future visit to the area without hesitation.",

But in fairness, (spoiler alert) book a table here...one always find something to celebrate no? It was like meeting someone super famous who's life you've been secretly following in the magazines... coz you see, wifey and I got all the River Caf\u00e9 cookbooks, and it's been a few years now that we're treating ourselves with that grilled polenta recipe, or even better, that tasty clams pasta dish - at home. And it was good! But everytime we cooked those dishes we thought \"how do you think this tastes in the actual restaurant? Are we far away? Is it another league?\" And the answer is a simple YES. It is another league. From the starter to that chocolate nemesis. To put it simple, everything was absolutely delicious. Not even a single tiny mistake. And that Nuovo Campi Riserva, red wine from another planet. A planet full of delicious grapes. We also enjoyed the fairly relaxed crowd, even with all those big cars on the parking lot :) Yup, The River Cafe is well pricey, but hey, this is one of the best restaurant experience I've had in my life...those souvenirs will stay, and that's priceless.",

The service was fine, but not as attentive as it should have been for the price. We joined the table late and we're not offered drinks, we had to stop a waiter to place an order. The food is interesting and I'm sure, at the peak of contemporary cuisine. However, for us, it was a little too creative for its own good and a lot of the taste and enjoyment was lost in the meal. Overall, we did have a nice time and can't take anything away from that, however, it is an extremely expensive restaurant and we didn't feel the quality of food and service was worth the charge.",

    "text": "River Caf\u00e9 is a London gem that has withstood the test of time, but it took news of its plans to open a sister restaurant in Mayfair that spurred me to visit the original. We came for dinner on a weekday evening, and unsurprisingly for a place of its calibre and price tag, it was predominantly full of work dinners. I don't get the sense this is a place many 20-somethings frequent. It's located in a residential area about 15 minutes' walk from Hammersmith station, and to get there I had to walk down quite a few dark and deserted roads. It's not necessarily the trendiest place in London to open a restaurant, but for this people are willing to make the trek. There were many taxis and Ubers dropping people off, given the long walk, but on a narrow street without any real room to navigate so there was a bit of a traffic jam. The restaurant is located along the river, but there is an awkward courtyard space between the restaurant and the water so you are not overlooking the water. The entrance is also not located on the street, so you have to walk into the courtyard and turn around before your see the signage for the restaurant. If you were walking down the street, you might not know that it was a restaurant. I also found the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant a bit strange. There is a long bar when you first enter, which seems like a place to wait for the rest of your party, and not actually used as a bar. If I were them, I would get rid of it and put in more tables. There was a projection of a working clock on the wall, and a brightly coloured artistic looking pizza oven, none of which really did it for me. There is also an abundance of staff, all rushing around looking very stressed, though that made it easy whenever I wanted to get their attention. As for the food, we ordered the chargrilled squid and the buffalo mozzarella to share for the table. There were 3 pieces of each, which was not an abundance of food, and I'd struggle to say that it was worth \u00a320 for a starter. For the mains, my friends all got the roast beef, and I got the slow roasted veal. I was tempted to get the veal sweetbreads, but paying over \u00a335 for sweetbreads that cost next to nothing didn't seem worth it. The server actually recommended not getting pasta as a main, which is something I do quite regularly when eating out at Italian restaurants when I can't finish both a pasta course and a meat course, and I found that interesting (maybe they are very traditional). The mains were delicious and I think more understandably worth the splurge. The predominant feeling I got from the food was that it was remarkably similar to what I had a Spring at Somerset House, which is Italian inspired without claiming to be through and through Italian, whereas River Caf\u00e9 (though you wouldn't guess by the name) is known for being one of the best Italian restaurants in town. The menu is full of Italian ingredients, but what really struck me here was that the choice of wine was also entirely Italian regions. I feel like the food from both River Caf\u00e9 and Spring are equal calibre, but at Spring I had a large window booth, plenty of room, a beautiful ambience and a relaxed dining atmosphere, whereas River Caf\u00e9 we were at a cramped table next to a lot of other diners and with stressed out servers running back and forth. The price tag is also equally steep. For now, River Caf\u00e9 has a Michelin star and Spring is a closely guarded secret, but I'd definitely prefer Spring. Perhaps the gap will narrow once River Caf\u00e9 gets a new location in central London!",

Gorgeous setting of course - that never changes, but other than that not a memorable experience. Ordered drinks and then dinner (appetizers - scallops and carpaccio and mains - monk fish and dover sole -- all good but not exciting). Appetizers arrived and...no wine yet. Waited, and waited. No one checked on us -- finally called over the waiter who said \"Oh -- let me check on that!\" Finally got my wine when almost done with my appetizer (said waiter blamed kitchen for late arriving wine - not sure I buy that). No one asked how our meals were, checked on us at all. Almost had to follow our waiter into the kitchen to get a second glass of wine. Even the water carafe was placed so far out of reach that we had to stand up and reach to refill our own glasses (cause there was no effort to do that by any of the staff). As they have two seatings and we chose the 9:00 we already knew that patrons need to be finished by 11. Around 10:20 the waiter came over as we had coffee and fairly forcefully repeated that fact. Yes, we know -- can you get us a taxi? He agreed to do that and then never checked back to tell us the taxi had arrived. We stood out in front of the place until a lovely man asked where we were headed and told us our taxi had been waiting at the side of the building. Meh -- a lot of money and a lot of attitude for not much return. Maybe I'm used to a higher standard, being from San Francisco, where this would NEVER have happened. Won't be back and won't be recommending.",

Not terrible, but a large unremarkable room as compared to the exquisite food and excellent service. So with that slight ding ( not enough to reduce it below 5 stars) lets get to the positives. Start with the bar. We arrived 30 minutes early (misjudged the London night traffic which is not quite as horrible as the day traffic) and, while seated early, did have a chance to enjoy cocktails at the comfortable bar. The custom drinks were excellent and would definitely recommend the summer cup and Mediterranean cosmopolitan. I had a local gin in my G&tT, which was very good but I did pine a bit for the fresh fruit martini. For appetizers, we had the crab salad (very solid) but the clear winners were the grilled scallops with eggplant and the grilled peppers with leeks and Swiss chard. The risotto with fresh porcini mushrooms as a split middle course was epic. For main courses, the grilled Turbot was good but the marinated lamb was even better. Off the charts, was the veal shank, which was as good a dish as I have had anywhere. Melt in your mouth texture with incredible flavor. Lemon tart for dessert was exquisite and the cheese course was also excellent. \u00a0Wine list was superb in the Italian categories and the Som. was very knowledgeable and eager to help. Throw in the excellent service and this is must eat in London.",

    "text": "The cooking at The River Cafe was indeed quality but it was simply far too expensive for my liking, \u00a340 for a main course at that kind of level was really questionable. It would set you back around \u00a390 if you have a 4 course meal, that is more expensive than most tasting menu in other 1 Michelin star venues. If I directly compare to The River Cafe to most of the other 1 stars restaurants (Eg: Launceston Place, Fera, Murano), they all involve higher technical skills, nicer presentation and most importantly, better tasting profile. So while The River Cafe has a nice river view, friendly service and good food, at close to the \u00a3100 mark, my expectations were not met.",
