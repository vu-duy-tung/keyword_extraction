Desserts are quintessentially British and so sweet that two bites do the trick. \u00a0I do wish Scott's were a tad cheaper - then I could go more frequently and really grow to love it.",

The oyster bar is great when you're just out with friends, very laid back and proper Colchester oysters - amongst a wider selection.The restaurant is fabulous for a good night out. They do a great monkfish, and their wine list is spectacular - I had the most amazing Meursault when I went Thursday, and I wish I'd have asked for the label. They have the most amazing art collection in there too. It's expensive, but well worth it. I go to J Sheekey a lot too, but out of both of them I think you get more value for money here. Good place to take someone you care about a lot!!!",

Our starters included the leek/potato soup and beetroot salad, both excellent. Entrees were the monkfish and sea breem . . my wife's dish didn't come exactly as requested, for which management waived the charges for dessert, a generous gesture.The selection of wines by the glass was not stellar, though staff made every effort to allow me to taste various choices before making a decision. Unfortunately, I've yet to find a European or Australian/New Zealand white that can compare to some of the best California chardonnays.Nice clubby decor. No problem getting a table, a real benefit of traveling during the off-season. A very decent experience overall.",

To start, roasted baby squid with a fried egg and ink dressing, good. Seared scallops were also good. I was looking forward to main course....heavy handed. I got skate wing, and based on the size of this dish, they were feeding it hamburgers in the back before they cooked it in an entire box of butter. It was insurmountable and just made me feel kind of gross for eating what should have been a flat fish that must have had the body image of a whale. The waiter had to take away 3/4 of it. (it wasn't isolated to mine, the halibut steak was like 2 inches thick and the size of a t-bone.)Not my pick, but then we ordered chocolate souffle? (okok, our fault, but.)Just too much.ps.

The space is opulent and intimate at the same time, with a huge mountain of ice in the middle of the bar covered with colourful crustaceans and molluscs. The lighting is perfectly judged, soft and understated. The service culture is about making you feel like a million dollars - energetic, full of charm and humour, attentive and respectful. Gorgeous art deco style china and silverware. What's on the plate? Exquisite morsels of fresh seafood and fish, daintily presented and seasoned with grace and panache. The plateau de fruits de mer rivals that of Balthazar in New York for generosity and variety. The ice is changed several times to keep it as fresh as possible. The wine list is satisfyingly broad, both in provenance and price range. Scott's is everything you need from a posh restaurant in a posh street: dazzling service, luxurious d\u00e9cor, a sense of effortless abundance, and steep prices. Marvellous.",

    "text": "The newly refurbished Scotts in Mount Street, Mayfair, London is a delightful restaurant. From the moment you walk in the door you know you are in for a wonderful dining experience. From the opulent Oyster Bar situated in the middle of the restaurant to the delightful staff every aspect of my visit was just perfect it was a pleasure for all the senses! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and there is a real buzz about it, as the fashionable new eaterie relaunched by Caprice Holdings. It is the most ideal to go celebrity spotting if you are into that sort of thing. However the real joy is obviously the food, days after visiting my friends and I were still ecstatic about what we had eaten, we visit many restaurants in London regularly but its been a long time since we had been served food of such high standard. The menu refreshingly clear compared to many places was hard to put down! With a ridiculous choice of Oysters and very heavily seafood based we knew we were in for a treat, the real giveaway to how good it was going to be came right at the beginning with the butter of all things! So often when you visit a restaurant you have a basket of bread and a few packets of butter dumped infront but oh no! this was something else, this restaurant had even gone so far as to think about the butter! Creamy, salty, I was going to love this place I knew it straight away! Anyway I began with an Onion and Goats Cheese Tart while my escort had Rock Oysters, a Crab and Cod Chitterlings, where does he put it all! For the main course I was really adventurous and had the traditional Fish and Chips while the other half had Squid. Well, you can't go wrong with Fish and Chips and my Haddock was battered beautifully, definitely a whole different experience to your typical chip shop experience but it was the Squid that has had us talking ever since. Squid can be a real bind to get right, you either need to do it for a really short time or cook it for at least an hour anywhere in between and you get a chewy horrid nightmare of a dinner. The only place we have ever eaten squid that is done to perfection is in Spain, lets face it the Spanish know how to cook their seafood so it was with some trepidation we ordered it. When it came to the table just looking at it and smelling it let me know that Iwas going to have to enjoy all of it.! It was absolutely nice, cooked to perfection, the knife just slid through it, the smell of garlic! Honeslty just thinking about it now makes me want to eat it all over again! It was just fantastic, it didnt last very long on the plate, and well since visiting Scotts I have bought Squid a few times just to try and do it the same as at the restaurant and while rather nice it just reminds me of how truly wonderful theirs was! Now clearly the most important part of dinner is dessert, obviously it was the first thing I had chosen before I had even decided on my main and Ihad the Bakewell pudding, not your ordinary lump of dry pastry with a bit of almond and cherry jam on top oh no there is an absolute master of pastry working at Scotts just delicious flaky pastry a wonderful almond paste with the cherry jam altogether it was gorgeous. . This finally brings me back to the staff, on our visit Don the doorman was the first face we met in his traditional top hat and what a gentleman he was! The ladies on the cloakroom and reception to the floor managers and the attentive waiters they were all very friendly and attentive without being overbearing, infact Ican honestly say that it was just as much them and their ability to make you feel like you were the only people in the restaurant they really wanted to take care off as the food that really made Scotts such a wonderful place to go.What about the cost? Well our bill came to 180 however we did have 2 bottles of wine, water, 4 Starters, 2 mains, 1 pudding and coffee. Infact considering the restaurant is in Mayfair one would expect it to be really expensive but its not, there are very reasonably priced wines on their list and the food is all very well priced. If you go onto the website for CapriceHoldings the group that own Scotts and click on the link for the restaurant you can view the Menu and the prices so are better able to budget for your visit which considering what a worrier I can be I found very reassuring prior to our visit.Go to Scotts, it truly is the most wonderful experience!",

The oyster bar situated in the middle, the sumptuous decor. It's a real class restaurant.The menu is a great mixture of old classics and the odd fun thing. Stargazey Pie always delivers.But if you want a simply griddled turbot with hollandaise you can get that too, although you pay for it.Extensive wine list, busy but professional waiters (they could be a bit friendlier in my book) and a place that you can sit back and watch the glitterati of Mayfair do their thing in stylish and comfortable surroundings.A real treat. Very expensive. Birthdays and special occasions only I would suggest unless you're minted. But every trip there has been a good one for me.",

    "text": "whether you're looking for a fresh, saut\u00e9ed filet of seabass or would rather kick back a dozen oysters, scott's is the place to go for all things seafood in london. \u00a0upon visiting, you'll first fall in love with the neighborhood. \u00a0it's nestled on an expressive little street in mayfair so you feel a bit like you've been swept away from the hustle and bustle of central london. you'll also smile when the polite chap at the door greets you and welcomes you to the restaurant. \u00a0as we hadn't made reservations ahead of time, (you'll definitely want to reserve a table in advance) we tried our luck at nabbing two seats at the bar. \u00a0lucky for us, 4 o'clock was pretty slow and we were sipping prosecco in no time.we started off with olives, almonds and of all things, pork rinds. \u00a0i'm sure they have a fancier name than pork rinds but for all intents and purposes, we were snacking on deliciously salty, super fried pork bits and were quite happy to do so! \u00a0after perusing the menu, we decided to have ceviche first. \u00a0my mother-in-law makes the most delicious ceviche ever so i'm a bit of a snob when it comes to this dish. scott's did it right though; just fresh lime juice, olive oil and a bit of diced red pepper for color and texture. it was topped with fried plantains that doubled as scoops.moving along to the mains. not that my husband's seabass in lemon butter sauce wasn't delicious. \u00a0it was phenomenal but i think my lobster and avocado salad took the cake. \u00a0there's really nothing richer and more decadant than huge hunks of lobster lightly dressed, tossed with small bits of grapefruit and slivers of endive. the salad looks petit in the picture but i assure you, your palette will be quite satiated once you're through.for us americans, the conversion rate from dollars to pounds doesn't do you any favors when you go to pay the bill here but if you want to treat yourself to a sophisticated seafood experience, be sure to check out scott's!",

Everyone else was an hour late so I was at the bar by myself for quite a while, and the pork scratchings, nuts and olives they brought me were brilliant. When we finally sat down to eat, I was able to choose my food quite quickly. The menu is quite concise, which is good, and I've been a few times before so I've tried most of it. I went for scallops with chilli butter followed by halibut with garlic mash and other good stuff. It was all great but I have one criticism, which is the same criticism I've had from my previous visits. I had to add salt and pepper to my food. Thats fine in a cafe or in a high street restaurant, but in a place with a reputation and prices like this, that should all be sorted before food leaves the kitchen. Salt and pepper on the table shouldn't be needed. But it was needed here, to get the best out of the fish.",

I had the monkfish and snails as my starter/appetizer and sea bass as my main dish. I was disappointed. The monkfish itself was good but the sauce they mixed with it was too salty. The sea bass was one of their most expensive dish in the entree list. It came only with the fish. A lot of oil was used to pan fry it and it was too salty as well. I like strong flavor but this was definitely overdone. Overall, it was not easy to find a seafood restaurant with good reviews in London. I went to J Sheeky as well. I guess seafood is not London's strengths in general.",

You could have been in coastal France for the quality of the king prawns (or Dublin Bay, I should imagine, but I've never been!), and it's not often you can say that in England. The service was most friendly and the staff were only too helpful in offering advice on wine. My daughter would also have been very jealous to see the celebrity who was dining near us, but I shan't name names. Suffice to say I wasn't surprised to see someone so well known eating in what I now know to be one of London's best restaurants.

Until our concierge offered to make us reservations and because we were staying around the corner, we thought sure we'll give it a shot. We could always just walk home.We ended up dining four times in the period of our 8-night stay in London. Twice for dinner and twice for dessert. That number probably would have been higher if the air show wasn't in town, it's buyers and sellers occupying most of the tables.The service is upscale but not pretentious. They remembered us from the second visit and the bartender even recalled the types of tea we like with dessert. The food was always perfectly prepared. The salads, refreshing; the fish, flawlessly cooked and impressively de-boned; the desserts, impeccable. It would be a crime not to visit and not try the chocolate-cherry fondant. We also tried the bakewell pudding, the lemon meringue, the berry torte, the chocolate mousse, and the summer pudding for two. We did not enjoy the pudding and despite the 18 pound price tag, it was removed from our bill. As I said, wonderful service.The place is pricey but absolutely worth it for a night on the town.",

This is no normal fruit pie, mind you. \u00a0It is an individual, round pie with the crispest, sweetest pastry encasing ripe, luscious end-of-summer plums that retained some of their structure and all of their sweet juice. \u00a0A dessert to be remembered! I loved this place. \u00a0The service is highly competent - polite without being overly intrusive. \u00a0If I had to nitpick about one small thing, it was the wait before we had to ask for the bill. \u00a0A small qualm! \u00a0Overall, highly recommend this place and cannot wait to go back my next trip to London.",

I started with the Bass ceviche with jalape\u00f1o and avacado....which wsd utterly delicious, all the flavours worked so well! Then I had the Fillet of River Esk sea trout...which I have to admit, I randomly picked...it was the kind of dish you never want to end....and to finish..even though I was positively stuffed, I had the Vanilla cheesecake with blush apricots..and the biscuit part of the cheesecake I was especially impressed with... quite often the biscuit part is either non existent or soggy! This was actual biscuit. Hard and crunchy and a taste of ginger. All in all, best meal ever ever ever.",

Sides were very, very good too. Spinach was very tasty and the fries were too good...i finished them. Swooooosh went my no-carb-diet... Also the baby potatoes, i'm sure they have their own potato-pusher-man, that walks in every day and deals them in alley in the back. So good, sweet, full, buttery and they almost popped in my mouth like pees! So good, must be illegal. The side with beans was gone before i had a chance...looked good! Thanks baby,..gggrr... My Bearnaise sauce was waiting, i didn't go for it, afraid i would see the bottom of that dish too, too soon.The Sole was very close to the best i had, better than Bentleys...sorry! And i loved that Sole! The cod was on My Love's plate, and he was happy, but also very happy he could eat of my plate too.I'm back! BAM!OH!!! I forgot about the cheeeeese!!... the cheese... Yep, i will wait at the backdoor tomorrow, and i'll write down the names of the potato-pusher and the cheese-dealer for you guys... damn, that blue cheese... Damn you!

I am usually not a huge fan of fish because it tends to be lacking in flavor, but the chef did a great job of bringing out the delicate flavors in these dishes. Fun story: We were seated next to a super cute elderly couple who were celebrating their anniversary. They looked so in love so we asked them what is the secret to a great marriage, and the gentleman told us: always keep your wife happy! There you have it lads, plain and simple. :)",

    "text": "For anyone who doesn't know, this restaurant has a few scenes in James Bond. This is an upscale restaurant that did not give an snobby feel whatsoever and does not have an official dress code. Which is good since I didn't have much to wear for my vacation in England. I wore what I brought: jeans, dress shirt and dress shoes. I came here with my wife and her parents. The restaurant is well decorated with the bar being the main attraction. All their utensils and plates are real silver and therefore heavy. I've never used any before until I came here.Appetizer / Drinks:1) Bread & butter were really good. It's always a sign that you're at the right place.2) White wine that was recommended by the waiter was excellent. Especially for the price of 35 pounds for a bottle.3) Dozen Oyster (45 pounds) - Everyone (but me) thought they were the best they ever had. They were by far the biggest/longest but given the price and all the chatter, I personally was not impressed. They're more into oysters than I am so take my review with a grain of salt.4) They charge for a bottle of water which is standard.Entrees:1) Roasted shellfish for two (84 pounds) - My wife and her mother shared this dish. I believe seafood is best when served with garlic and butter which had both. The garlic and butter was not overwhelming and at the right ratio. The scallops and prawns were great but the lobster was the best I ever had!! The meat was so delicate and tasteful that I was blown away.2) Dover Sole (43 pounds) - I got the 16oz and it was definitely enough for one person. I liked how they brought out the fish where they grilled it in to show me before they put it onto a plate. You could hear the sizzling and it reminded me of the time when I used to work as a cook at my dad's seafood restaurant. The sizzling sound off of a hot silver plate and the smell of butter... delicious. They also brought a side of melted butter in case I wanted to add more.3) Rib-steak (36.50 pounds) - My father-in-law decided to get steak to diversify our meal. It was surprisingly decent. Sides:1) Mixed Tomato Salad with Basil (10.75 pounds) - This was the largest size for the side salad and it wasn't that much. But from my short experience this was pretty standard in England.If you're willing to spend some $$$ I would recommend Scott's.",

When we arrived at 7:45, a bitchy hostess first made us wait for almost 10 minutes only to tell us that she gave away our table. She claimed that she couldn't reach us. There were no missed calls on our mobile! After a little while they seated us anyway.The food wasn't bad, but enjoyment was already impaired and it only got worse. At 8:40 one of the hostesses told us that we couldn't get dessert because the table was booked again at 9:00. Not pleased, we asked for the check. The check came quickly, but for the next 25 minutes, no one bothered to pick up the cash and return the change - I guess the 9:00 party didn't show. Lucky them. - A tip of one penny seemed adequate.There is a lot more detail to the experience that isn't worth reciting, but Scott's is ready for Brexit and Europe will be better for it.",

    "text": "This establishment reminds me of something you'd take your parents to for a holiday dinner. Even though it's in Mayfair, it's almost a throwback restaurant to a different era where everything is very traditional. When we got there, we were greeted warmly, and sat immediately at the bar, where I had requested. I thought it would be more casual than the dining room. The patrons next to us kept asking for three pieces of cheddar cheese which wasn't on the menu and the bartender kept advising the customer that a cheese cart would be coming out shortly but finally after asking and asking, they finally called down to the kitchen and asked them to cut up some cheddar for this customer. On one hand, it's great customer service, but on the other hand, we couldn't put our drink order in for 15 minutes while he talked about the cheddar. Then, when that was finally resolved, the customer on the other side of us stopped the bartender midstride to say he was ready to order but then spent another 15 minutes asking about specific ingredients and possible modifications to about 5 different dishes. When he finally got his order, he told the bartender that it was good but here's a few things they could do to the dish to make it better. He's telling the BARTENDER.......and this is all happening before we even got our food. Even though the finicky modifier to our left was seated after us.  So maybe it's the clientele that put us off more than anything? The service itself seemed perfunctory. It's almost like you had to be very assertive to get decent service and for 150 pounds for two people, I just wasn't feeling like doing that. I had a souffl\u00e9 which was decent and the chicken dish for a main course. It was fine. We didn't stay for the cheese cart or dessert.If you enjoy a touristy restaurant set in a fancy location, then this is definitely the place for you.",

We enjoyed a seat at the bar and had the oysters, fish on the bone, burrata appetizer and the marinated salmon. All of which were amazing! So delicious. I would come back again!",

I've been in London for a few days so I guess I've gotten a little spoiled By the restaurants I've eaten at in the Mayfair district of LondonThe sexy fish.

Our party of 7 was well taken care of and food came out relatively quickly.Food was overall quite good. My John Dory was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments were small but prepared well. My husband had Halibut which I thought was excellent, but he said it wasn't super fresh. Other dinner guests enjoyed their lobster, seabass, and shrimp. I didn't taste those so I can't comment, but they certainly looked delicious.Prices are quite high so be prepared! Overall I think Scott's is good in every way except for their unnecessarily high prices. We may return since we stay nearby.",

The Dover Sole is to die for get it Meuni\u00e8re style. The only place you can get it that might be better is in the Dorchester Hotel. Nice wine list we got a great bottle of Brunello. Scallops, on the shell, are also good and the chips go nicely with the fish. \u00a0 One critique is that I think they use a lot of butter in the cooking but hey so would I cuz it's delish. I've been a few times now and this is a restaurant sure to Feature in my rotation for any future London visits.",
