Probably not the best comment to have for a place specialising in grilled cheese sandwiches...Don't get me wrong, the sandwiches were good and tasty, but there just wasn't that satisfying gooey middle packed of cheese that just splurges out the side of the sandwich. You know what I mean. They do have however, some really interesting flavours and specials! I'd happily go in if I was looking for a grilled cheese sandwich and was in the area, but I'm not fully sold on the way they're doing it at the moment, at least, not enough to go out of my way to come back to this place!Also, I get that this is just a small place churning out the sandwiches, but seeing plastic boxes filled with premade sandwiches doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that my sandwich is particularly fresh or individually made...",

    "text": "I have loved grilled cheeses for many years. This love was only cemented by a restaurant in Toronto that was dedicated to the humble sandwich and was the best I had ever had. Ever since then I have hoped that someone would show this sandwich the respect it deserves by dedicating an establishment in London just to its gooey deliciousness and finally there is one! \u00a0But is it any good? \u00a0 Ehhhh. It's okay! \u00a0 It's a small place with room enough only to sit ten inside. It's clean and it's very bright inside and there is a nice atmosphere in there despite its small size. But what about the melts? They have quite a few to choose from, ranging from lamb to bbq chicken, pulled pork and even dessert melts with nutella. I opted for the salami cheese melt as with porcini mushrooms and red leicester cheese it seemed like a taste sensation! \u00a0 The bread was toasted well, not underdone or burnt which is very important. The flavour of the actual sandwich was also really tasty - the only downside is how tight they are with the filling! When I have a grilled cheese I want to be able to really taste the cheese! The staff there are really nice but getting your sandwich can take a little while so don't expect to be in and out. \u00a0 Give it a chance! As a new business they might just need some time to work the kinks out and while the portion isn't plentiful it is tasty.",

It specialises in a range of toasted sandwiches; they are mostly savoury but I spotted a sweet one (Nutella and mascarpone on milk bread).I wavered a bit, but ended up choosing the sweet one just because of the unusualness of it. When it came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. Maybe I was expecting something more chunky, but it looked like an underdone toasted sandwich using ordinary supermarket bread. I liked it a bit more once I started eating it, but it was still nothing spectacular.I did notice a few people walking away from the shop, having bought some of the savoury toasted cheese sandwiches. These looked better and might be the way to go if you try this place.",

The cheese was still very worm but It tasted so good I couldn't stop eating.

    "text": "To put it bluntly, the food here is fairly average. I had the slow roast lamb toastie and a side salad. The lamb was fairly bland. The cheese with it (swiss) didn't really work for me. Apparently there's mustard on it. I barely could taste it. The bread is quite crisp, but really lacked the butteriness you want on the outside of your sandwich. I don't think they used any at all. The salad was some greens and some chopped green onions. Luckily, it came with way too much dressing on the side so I could dip my sandwich in it to make it taste of something.I'm a huge fan of cheese, but the hype around this place is just that: hype. I was expecting a life-changing melt in your mouth toastie, and I got something that I probably would have liked as a thirteen-year old, but as an adult, my palate has expanded. If the first bite I take makes me think, \"Yeah, I can do this better at home\", it's not a good sign. It's probably also not a good sign that I was there for 15 minutes during lunch hour, and there were a small number of people who came in.Service was fine, and the staff were friendly, but as toasties go, there was a huge level of disappointment. Honestly, two stars is probably a bit harsh, but three is way too generous. So what can you do? It's (relatively) cheap though at \u00a34-5 a toastie, so I guess that's something.",

The pulled pork is good, but not the best thing I've ever had. It was a little dry, could possibly have used a bit of sauce, and the delicate flavor of the pork clashed somewhat with the mustard and choice of cheese. Maybe try something else. The mac and cheese, however, is worth the trip to Soho if you're a homesick American. Gooey cheese, al dente macaroni, and for \u00a31 extra, a thin but flavorful slice of Canadian-style bacon.

    "text": "At its core, the grilled cheese sandwich is reminiscent of the simple, uncomplicated childhood memories of yore. A good grilled cheese sandwich isn't meant to be gourmet. It's meant to cut you straight to the core and smother you with nostalgia before shattering this facade and forcing you to swallow the bitter pill of adulthood and all associated responsibilities.I clearly should've studied philosophy at university. Instead, I chose to eat delicious $10 grilled cheese sandwiches and subpar $10 grilled cheese sandwiches. Call me the tortured soul of our generation. But when I walked into Melt Room, I realized that all I wanted was comfort food, plain and simple. My classic toastie was fine, I guess. No fancy ingredients, no gimmicks. It was a vague \"cheese blend\" on sourdough. No complaints about how the bread was toasted. But the sandwich itself was just... bland. There was nothing special about the cheese and it wasn't gooey like the grilled cheese sandwiches in my memories. But is anything ever as good as how you remember it?Realizing that I should have gotten one of their fancier toasties is probably what growing up feels like. And it only cost me \u00a34 to figure that out!",

I'm more annoyed that Melt Room have signed up to uber eats when they clearly can't deliver a good quality product, although saying that I don't think much of the toasties when visiting the shop in Soho.I would recommend avoiding visiting or delivery. Buy a toastie maker instead...",

We also tried the cheesy fries and truffle fries, but they're pretty much the same, just the truffle fries has truffle oil added to it which is not much of a difference in taste. Also, the check-in deal is no longer accepted. They gave it to me (since it's basically just a free soda) after a lot of confusion but they say they don't have any links with Yelp anymore.",

Much to my disappointment, Melt Room, despite all its potential, proved that grilled cheese is better at home. My wife and I came on a weeknight, and the place was deserted. A lone worker, and not a single customer for the time we were here. The guy was friendly enough, but it's the food that fell flat. On paper, it sounds amazing, but in practice, it was just bland. I went with the BBQ chicken, which had absolutely no BBQ flavor at all. The chicken was bland as well. There was basically no flavor. My wife had the Classic, and reported a similar issue. Bland. I don't get the bland bit. One of the first things I noticed after moving to the UK four years ago, is the incredible selection of cheese, especially cheddar. In ever supermarket I've been to here, I've always seen at least half of a dairy case devoted to a seemingly infinite variety of cheddar cheese. So, I ask, how/why does Melt Room supply the one kind of cheddar that is bland? It makes no sense. If any foodie culture should be able to seize this classic food and grow it for the next generation, it should be the Brits and their wonderful cheeses. This place doesn't do grilled cheese justice. It was such a disappointment, I can't really imagine we'll give it a second try.",

There was a strange V on one of the packet, so I figured it was for Vegetarian, right ? But maybe it was a L, or maybe they switched the packets before handing them to us, but....yeah we almost eat the wrong grilled cheeses ;)No worries, with all the beautiful flavours it was hard not to recognise the one with delicious and soft lamb. The lamb + the cheese + the mustard : gosh, I wished it never ended !! Even if this one is a little bit expensive (7\u00a3), you should try it !I had one bite of the beetroot grilled cheese : heaven for vegetables lovers !Just one tip for the staff : maybe try to cut the grilled cheese in half for the take away orders, it will be much easier to eat.",

I will admit I completely missed the menu on the wall, instead I saw one of the specials, grilled cheese with bacon? SOLD.I was the only one in there at the time so ordering was quick. The lady immediately went to work, bacon on the hot plate, freshly cooked, not reheated. Other people came in and ordered and I zoned out for a while while listening to my audiobook... The lady behind the counter catches my attention, and then hands me an insulated bag with my sandwich, I peek inside to see... macaroni and cheese, inside my grilled cheese. Apparently in my haste to order bacon, I didn't read the rest of the description. But what a treat! The macaroni was a little messy but so worth it. It was tasty, the bacon came apart nicely (was streaked enough that you didn't have to fight with it) and all good in a single hand held package.Eaten quickly and I was on my way. A nice pitstop to end the evening! \u00a35 might be a little steep, but it's a good sandwich made to order.",

In fact I grew up making these late at night or at uni cos it's cheap or to eat in a club with a can of red stripe (Bristol I love you).But when I get here I realise upon looking with own eyes that these toasties. In fact most if not all need me to be more gooey and cheesy though. Grill my cheese is better for proper cheese toasties and even some food stalls on Borough market. Toasties should be like dirty munchie food and not seem to be perfect when toasting. The bread should be slightly overpowered by the cheese melting over, I shouldn't have to taste too much bread. I do admire there price range though. \u00a35 is just about on tipping point for most so that's fair as its central London too. They also do have a ice varied range in terms of other fillings also.I miss my uni days of imperfect late night toasties in all honesty, and I may invest in a George Foreman grill once again. I can't help being felt let down. Melt Room hasn't quite nailed it. It's like gourmet cheese toasties. Which is not what I think it is about. I think they should be pushing to more extremes, certainly visually which is what we see first in food. The taste is OK but give me more. Is it Instagramable? No. Then it's not pushing itself hard enough.",

Imagine my confusion when I open it to see Heinz tomato soup looking back at me - At least have a warning as I would definitely have ordered something different.
