Crazy, but the line kept getting longer behind me so I figured it was a good sign. They kept bringing out chai for the people in line too, which was really nice -- plus, I actually got inside into the bar after about 40 minutes, and actually seated maybe 15 after that. They definitely have their system down, which I appreciated. The food and service were all really good. Everything I tried was great, so I don't think you can go wrong with anything, but definitely check out the dishes highlighted on the menu in the little boxes -- I had the pau bhaji and house daal and loved the flavors in both. For main I went with a \"boring\" choice, chicken tikka, but it too was really great, with all of the flavors in perfect combination.",

The service is quite good considering they are so busy.I loved their keema pau . It had the right spice and was awesome. We also got chicken ruby which was oK (mild) .They have a unique menu and must recommended for the experience !",

So simple, yet revolutionary and absolutely brilliant.TRY THE COFFEE. It's no costa crap.GET A SIDE OF MASALA BEANS.

You WILL regret it. To any critics of London's food scene, I say: go to Dishoom because you're wrong.Lovely ambiance with marble tables and cute lighting, friendly servers, and an interesting mix of clientele. For dinner, my friend and I shared the okra fries, chicken ruby, Masala prawns, black house daal, garlic naan, and Roomala roti. Everything was EXCELLENT. We didn't manage to finish all of our food, but it was INCREDIBLE, and I was very sorry to leave food left over. We couldn't stop talking about it and had to return the next morning to try the legendary bacon naan roll. For breakfast, we split the bacon naan roll, sausage and egg naan roll, Bombay omelette, and we each ordered breakfast lassis. I actually liked the sausage and egg naan roll better than the bacon naan roll, but both were phenomenal and lived up to the hype. The Bombay omelette was average, but hey, there's not much you can do with an omelette. The breakfast lassis (yogurt, banana, and mango topped with oats) were AMAZING.I don't know what I can say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said on Yelp. Hands down my best food experience in London (if not the entirety of my Eurotrip). Do it. Worth the wait.",

I did still have a wait of \u00a0about 7-10 minutes in the wind and light rain, but they serve warm chai outside. A few things stuck out for me. You feel like you are entering a 4-5 star hotel or exclusive night club in the way they handle you. There are 2 door people who are outfitted with headsets. They take your name, after which the next 5 people will address you by name in the restaurant. Once you get past the door people, there is a mini reception. They address your party by name and let you know that there is a bar downstairs where you can wait till your table is ready. When you get downstairs, another reception greets your party by name and shows you to the bar. At the bar, the bartender crafts cocktails for you, takes your credit card and hands you a proxy card to take with you to your table. The table was ready in 5 minutes, while we were still sipping our drinks. When we arrived at our table, the host took our proxy card, again addressing our party by name. The food was very good. The service throughout was immaculate. The prices were very reasonable. Another interesting bit -- all of the service staff were from Europe (e.g. Spain, etc...) -- not an Indian in site, but the food was clearly cooked by Indian hands. Would definitely come again.",

The drink was so good it's like a mojito but with tequila and it was incredible. The chicken was so good and it was so perfectly cooked it tasted like butter. And the Naan they cooked perfectly there was not too much garlic and it was cooked where it wasn't too bready but still tasted awesome. The one downside is that it is pretty expensive. London overall is expensive but for a students budget it was a lot. It was \u00a37.50 for the drink, \u00a37.50 for the chicken, and \u00a32.90 for the naan- so about 30 American dollars total.

I was in the area from a light shopping spree when I had the craving for some serious asian persuasion... My morale compass knew what time it was and I made my way to Dishoom! I was seated in the courtyard which was lovely actually.. Cosy and pretty at the same time! I had a cold glass of champagne to begin with and then went on to have my meal.... Here's where I lose points people.... I can't remember what I had! Lol Well I can't recall the name... But it was sublime! Flavour town, flavour planet .... FLAVOUR EMPIRE!!!!!!soft,juicy,well marinated chicken something!!! I mean I'm seriously reconsidering moving to Asia just so I can bask in flavours like these all day everyday!!! I can recommend the garlic naan which was yummy and the chutneys that they gave me were alllllllll delicious!

We waited 15 minutes outside before going in, got to the bar to order a drink and within less than 5 minutes were given a table! I suppose they overestimate waiting time to avoid complaining customers, understandable.Food - absolutely delicious and I'm not a huge Indian cuisine consumer. We ordered the Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Chicken Tikka, Basmati Rice, Pau Bhaji, Lamb Boti Kabab and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and very flavourful.Service - waiter was extremely helpful in suggesting different plates and the right amount. Also helped with understanding the flavours of each dish. Drinks - ordered the chilli martini which was sweet and delicious! Too stuffed for dessert, but based on the entrees I can predict its nothing short of amazing as well.

You think that you've finally made it, but instead they give you a buzzer and sit you at the bar!Anyway - food-wise, it was phenomenal. Great authentic indian dishes - I don't recommend ordering both the curries as they are the same base (but one with chicken and the other one with paneer - I wish they had clarified this with us earlier). Otherwise, the curry on its own was great! The chicken-tikka wrap was mediocre, also - but everything else was fab. Small portions and relatively pricey, but thats what you get in return for the ambiance and beautiful decorations.",

For some reason I'd been under the impression food in the UK wouldn't be very good, but Dishoom took that notion and threw it out the window.Firstly: don't be scared by the line. It moves quickly, and according to my London friend who has come here before, they grossly overestimate the time you'll spend queuing up to get in to the restaurant. Plus, they give you free fizzy lemonade while you wait. The food is exceptional and the service is quite good, too. We got a variety of plates: crispy, spicy okra fries (how have I not had these before?!), yummy garlic naan, tangy chicken tikka, paneer tikka, and the perfectly dressed bowl of greens. You know a restaurant is good when you're savoring every bite of the simply dressed greens. Anyhow, between two ladies, we thought we might have enough food to bring home for leftovers, but after a taxing day of tourist-ing, we happily ate everything in front of us. Consequently, my recommendation is to get a whole bunch of plates and share the food among your party. You'll want to sample everything you see, anyway!I got the salted caramel khulfee for dessert, which is basically like a salted caramel ice cream pop. It was yummy, and I didn't share it.Come here! I wish we had Indian food this good and inexpensive where I live.",

I've frequented it plenty of times, there's so many dishes to choose from and they even do the salads well. A hearty, wholesome and incredibly delicious and fresh option for indian cuisine, I've never been disappointed and usually find myself too full to finish what I've ordered in my sheer excitement over the menu (but that's nothing new)I haven't been before dinner service, but I hear breakfast and brunch is done exceedingly well here and the restaurant works well for any social setting; a date, a relaxed social with friends and on a business level.

The two make for a great combination!Although the entrance to the restaurant is situated on a Shoreditch backstreet, the decorative interior and ambience makes it feel like you're stepping into a different world. The lights are dimmed, giving a dark and moody atmosphere, even during late afternoon. But not in a gothic way - it has the persona of an imperial Bombay cafe. \u00a0There is an outdoor terrace for the warmer summer evenings - however it is not possible to request a booking here - and the centre of the restaurant has a wide open square space fronted by the bar.The service was excellent and the food was creative and delicate at a reasonable price. The menu allows you to order small plates or a main meal. The grilled lamb kebab and chicken ruby tasted amazing and there was a choice of Indian beers and IPAs.As can be expected for a restaurant such as this, there was a 40 minute wait for a table. Dishoom keeps back most of their tables for walk-ins. But at least there wasn't a queue halfway down the street - Dishoom allows you to sit at the bar with an electronic bleeper that lets you know when your table is ready.Would definitely visit again and try some more dishes.",

This place is a huge disappointment! They need to change their chef or teach him how to cook Chicken Tikka Masala(Ruby). It tasted of uncooked tomatoes and the spices were not throughly cooked.The next dish we tried was a biryani and God help us. \u00a0It only made me miss the countless other decent biryanis I have had in my life time.

The first time I came for dinner on a Friday night, and the wait time for our party of 3 was around 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. After we finished (around 8 pm, I'm guessing), the line was HUGE so I'd recommend getting here earlier rather than later. The second time (today) we - a party of 9 - came for lunch and the wait time was just around 15 minutes. I know Dishoom recommends ordering \"family style\" but all of us ordered our own dishes and shared for tastes. I opted for the Chicken Tikka with a side of Garlic Naan, and might I say that I REALLY enjoyed it. The portion size was perfect for me (maybe even a little too much) and I finished all of what I ordered. The spice level was just right, too, especially when paired with the naan. Everyone else in our party also really enjoyed their meal, and we all left happy, satisfied, and in (slight) food comas. The environment here is pretty awesome too. It seems really modern and the decor is on point. The staff is also amazing and definitely contributed to my great experience here both times. The minus one star is only because I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food to begin with, but I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets - or it's the best I've had, at least.",

The food selection is just right - not enough to overwhelm but plenty of veg and non-veg options. It is a great place for family-style dining and even tapas, or just ordering your own meal. The waitstaff is lovely and very accommodating and even without a booking and going late on a Friday night, the wait was not too long. You can dress up or come as you are - either way you will fit in!",

Usually at most restaurants I've been to, the tandoori is always this eerie red color. Here, it was more of a grilled chicken color. It was light and very well seasoned with a touch of spiciness. I was super stuffed, but didn't feel bloated.I was spying samosas on the tables around me which I will try on my next go. Will be back eventually.",

    "text": "We were visiting the UK from the US and with me being British I couldn't leave without having at least one Indian meal. I found this restaurant through reviews on Tripadvisor and on our last night in London cancelled a very pricy high end restaurant to go here instead, and it was a fantastic decision! The restaurant is right off Leicester Square, so really quite convenient. We went early, around 6:30pm, and there was already a queue outside, and of course we chose the windy, rainy, cold night :-) Not to worry, we decided to \"suffer\" as the restaurant was already packed, so this was a good sign, and the people in the queue were all meeting from work, so it made me feel better that it was not all tourists. They keep the system very organized, so take your name outside, and continually keep brining out drink samples for you to keep you happy and interested, a very nice touch, and then when there is room in the bar downstairs, they move you from the queue to the bar. After 25 mins we were going to the downstairs bar, and at the door downstairs the hostess greeted us by our name, again really nice and just high class giving it all the touches diners like. We ordered a drink and an appetizer and by the time we had finished our buzzer was flashing to let us know our table was ready, but again, this restaurant is so well run, the hostess beat us to it by coming to us to take us to our table. We didn't have to settle our bill downstairs, they transfer it to your dining room table, again a nice touch.Our server, Lucie, was friendly, professional and knew the menu inside out. She kindly explained the menu to us and then asked if we wanted a few minutes to look it over, which we did. We ordered a lot, as we wanted to try a bunch of stuff - vegetable samosas - we had these in the bar downstairs. The pastry was perfectly crispy and the inside was nicely spiced. Really, really nice. At the table we ordered spicy lamb chops - nicely cooked, three small chops on the plate that were very well presented and tasted gorgeous. Lots of meat on them. Perfect size. Black House Daal - Mmmmmmmm perfect creamy texture and perfect flavourings. So good. Chicken Ruby - OMG! Creamy, lightly spiced, lots of big chucks of chicken. Perfect! Haleem is their signature dish but my husband and I didn't really like this one. It wasn't horrible, just didn't stand up to everything else on the table. Side of greens - the vegetables were steamed and chilli and lime juice sprinkled over. Very, very tasty and fresh. Also, of course, and order of garlic naan. Like I said, we ordered a lot, and we were glad we did. Wish we had been in a position to be able to take home all the leftovers, because at breakfast the next day I was certainly thinking about it again. The service in this restaurant in fantastic. Lucie never stopped running around and was on top of everything. All other servers were also helping on all other tables and not just their own. The manager was busting her butt too running around and was visiting every table to make sure everything was ok. We were staying at the Cavendish Hotel down the road on Jermyn St, and they need to take some lessons from this restaurant on service!!! Absolutely outstanding from the queue at the front door to leaving without our leftovers :-( Wish we had gone earlier in the week as we would have loved to have gone again, even if just for breakfast or lunch. The ambience is lively, the pictures on the walls seem to all be of old Bombay, either ad's, actresses, films etc., and the lighting is trendy and awesome and fits the space well. Don't miss this restaurant and take the time to wait in the queue outside, it is SO worth it.",

I've been twice and each time had ridiculous wait times; the second time being over one hour outside in the freezing cold and they didn't even have heaters or let us order from the bar, which would have made our wait less painful. Then once inside we had to wait another 20 minutes at the bar downstairs for a table. The food, while interesting, was overly salty (on both visits) and not that memorable. Highlights were the fried okra chips, the greens and the mango ice lollies. Please note that they don't serve the customary curries, this is Bombay street cuisine. All in all, this is not worth your time or money; you'll be much happier with any of the decent Indian restaurants around Euston Station at a much cheaper price, though you won't get the same atmosphere.",

The atmosphere is very cosy, with lots of different pictures everywhere, a bit dark downstairs but I quite like that at times. We tried the Bombay Pimms which was a really interesting take on normal Pimms, definitely not something I would have chosen but I enjoyed it nonetheless! We were then provided with lots of different small plates, including a bhel salad and skate cheeks which were really really lovely! Kheema Pau, a mince lamb dish with bread, was also tasty, though I think the skate cheeks were the hit of our group!Needless to say I think I'll be coming back here to try more of what this lovely Bombay Cafe has to offer.",

The cocktail menu is short, but thoughtful. Every drink has a Bombay twist. I would recommend the Bombay Colada. It's smoother, lighter and much more complex in flavour than a regular pina colada. My two favourite dishes are the Murgh Chicken (grilled chicken thigh) and the Black Daal - both are to die for. I'm not usually a chicken thigh kind of gal, but I'd choose this thigh over a piece of chicken breast any day. Although the Chilli Cheese Toast came highly recommended, I didn't think it was much more than plain old cheese on toast with a few chillies... something I can do myself at home.And of course you must not leave without trying one of the Kulfi Sticks.

Luckily, I have a friend who lives in the area and she made a reservation for us as soon as she found out I was visiting! We ended up getting to the restaurant about half an hour before our reservation and just thought we'd check in to see if our table is ready. They directed us to the bar while they got our table ready. It was only about 10-15 minute later that we were seated at our table. Service was out of this world from the very moment we walked in! We ordered the chicken tikka, paneer tikka, black daal, pau bhaji, gunpowder potatoes, chilli cheese toast, jackfruit biryani, raita, garlic naan, and rumali roti. All for only 3 people - we just couldn't resist! Everything was so delicious - I don't think I could pick a favorite. I will say though that I'm not really a fan of daal, but their black daal was pretty delicious - even to me. Something that I wasn't really expecting to like, but loved was the jackfruit biryani. I've never had it before, or really any dish with jackfruit in it so I wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be what I probably ate the most of! I highly recommend trying it. TIP: MAKE A RESERVATION! I walked by the restaurant a few times during my trip and every single time there was a looooong line outside. I would have hated to be one of those people waiting in the cold. If you like Indian food and you're going to be in London, you're going to want to go here - just go ahead and make the reservation. :)",

    "text": "When we searched \"Best Indian food in London\" on Yelp, Dishoom seemed like a no-brainer since it boasted over 1000 five star reviews. After learning the wait time for a table was over an hour and a half, we thought \"If people are willing to wait over an hour and a half for a meal, this food must be outta this world! No one would be stupid enough to waste almost 2 hours of their life standing in line for mediocre food!\"We debated whether we should stay or go, but the curiosity of why anyone would wait so long for a meal got the better of us and we decided to wait it out. There were several hostesses who put your name on the waitlist and bring you hot chai while you stand in the cold London streets. Exactly 1h30m later we were ushered inside. The restaurant was simply decorated, elegant, classy, but simple. I was surprised at what a well oiled machine it all seemed. I must have counted at least 5 hosts/hostesses (at least)! Over 20 servers, and hundreds of guests. We were guided downstairs where the ambiance wasn't as pretty, and after 1h30m of waiting we were seated by the staircase (where guests came in and out of), not the best start. My expectations are now really high given that I agreed to wait so long. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish with tamarind sauce, the paneer tika masala, naan, and the jackfruit biryani. The spicy shrimp dish, though a tad bit over salted, tasted delicious, and the sweet tangyness of the tamarind chutney made it a really flavorful dish. Unfortunately all the other dishes we ordered were underwhelming. The paneer tika lacked spices, it was flavorless, and other than the fact that we were eating cheese --- cause who doesn't love cheese, it wasn't very special at all, and it was even a little dry. The naan was neither bad nor good. It was just your every day naan that you can get anywhere (without having to wait over 2hrs for it). But worst of all was the Biryani. It was overpriced dry and flavorless rice, with very scarce pieces of equally flavorless jackfruit. The service was also all over the place. Although the host staff was friendly, our waitress was flustered and barely came to our table, we had to ask for water several times before it was brought to us. Lastly they boast to offer \"unlimited chai\" but when you're paying almost $5 per chai, it BETTER be unlimited refills. Under normal circumstances (meaning, if I hadn't had to wait in line for 1h30m, and then another 30m to get our food), I would given Dishoom 3 stars. Had the food been exceptional, I would have had NO hesitation rating it 5 stars, however, due to the mediocrity of it all, add the extensive waiting period, i would argue that 2 stars is a fair rating. As we were seated at our table, we heard many Americans chatting at several tables nearby and we realized Dishoom is more of a hyped up tourist trap than a legit establishment for fine Indian fare. I encourage folks to read The Guardian review of Dishoom (by Jay Rayner) before waiting 2hrs for an overpriced Indian meal. If you want to stand in line, then go ahead! But we'll be opting for a place in Southall with better food and no wait!",

While it is quite long, they do offer hot tea (chai and mint) as you queue up. Grab a glass - it'll come in handy as the chilly evening sets in. It's also both free and delicious, so there really isn't any reason not to.For being such a casual place with a reasonably priced menu, the ambiance here is quite upscale. To boot, the attentive waiters running around with smiles on their faces make for great service. They bang those dishes out blazing fast. I received my order within 10 minutes of placing it.On the flip side, I think that the food here is a tad overhyped. While they do serve very solid Indian fare, I was not quite blown away as I hoped. Per my server's recommendation, I ordered the Chicken Ruby, the House Black Daal, and the Garlic Naan. All very good, none particularly outstanding. What actually wowed me the most was the mint & coriander sauce that was served on the side as a dip. That stuff was to-die for, so make sure you at least give it a taste!**UPDATE**Since writing my review, I've been to Dishoom several times more, trying both their breakfast and all-day menus.

    "text": "Wow this place is popular! Every time we walked by there was a line out the door! We came around 8/9pm on a weekday and it was about a hour wait. I liked that the wait seemed fair (followed the sequence in which people arrived) and they handed out hot tea while waiting. If you are waiting outside in line, they eventually move you to the bar where you may wait another 15-30 minutes. Luckily the food was worth the wait! We had their house dal and chicken ruby with rice and naan. This was one of my fianc\u00e9s first Indian food experiences so I told him if he did not like the food here then he would probably not like Indian food anywhere. Thankfully we both loved it!For dessert we had the chocolate pudding with vanilla chili ice cream. They were definitely the perfect complement to each other as I don't think I'd enjoy the chili flavor of the ice cream without the richness of the pudding.I'd highly recommend coming here!",

The black house daahl basically tasted like a bean dip. The Chicken Tikka Roll was excellent and unique.The service was nice here and while the recommendations were hit and miss, Dishoom is a solid choice in London.",

    "text": "Not an Indian food expert. We came here because we know London has amazing Indian food. My Indian friends told me it is much better than the food back home. From our yelp search, we made reservations here.Two stories and we would recommend reservations given how popular it is. We decided to be brave and order a bunch of things we never tried. PAU BHAJI (A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered, home-made bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)(S)4.50) - This was boxed on their menu and I wanted some veggies. This was our favorite item! It was so flavorful! Can't believe its veggies!AWADHI LAMB (The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. (S)10.50) - My husband loves BIRYANI so we ordered this. We ordered yogurt to go with it. They gave us a big bowl of it! The yogurt was really refreshing and delicious but unfortunately the biryani was so-so. Not as flavorful. HOUSE BLACK DAAL (A Dishoom signature dish -- dark, rich, deeply flavoured. It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. (V)5.90) - Also boxed on their menu. It was our second favorite item. It is made from what I think is mung beans (or similar). You don't like mung beans then I wouldn't order this. DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA (A family recipe, using a marinade of sweet vinegar, not yoghurt. Laced with ginger juice, turmeric, garlic and green chilli. (S)7.90) - As close to the famous chicken tikka marsala you will get here. Came with 4 big pieces of chicken. Its not as creamy but good. It was a bit sweet for me. Garlic naan- we got one. You can get it buttered or not. It was good. Overall, it was a good meal. Unfortunately, I don't eat Indian food that often so I am no expert. Flavors were very different but good from the Indian food I've had in the States.Plenty of restrooms that is pretty nice.",

I wouldn't even try getting in for a pre-theater dinner, but thankfully they accept breakfast reservations and they held ours even though we arrived just after the 15-minute window. Breakfast at Dishoom is always a pleasure, but until this meal, I thought it ended abruptly at 11:45 a.m., the last seating time for the meal. Not so, at least here on this day: They kept bringing us chai long after that time and after we'd finished our meals and settled in to read the papers. We finally, reluctantly got up to visit the nearby Portrait Gallery and National Gallery.",

    "text": "I had a great experience at Dishoom. \u00a0I was visiting from the USA, where we have plenty of excellent Indian restaurants, but knowing how integral Indian cuisine is to the UK culinary world (chicken tikka masala is an unofficial dish of the UK!) I just had to try an Indian restaurant while I was here. \u00a0Dishoom came highly recommended by several UK Yelpers, so one night after work I made the trek to Covent Garden to check this place out.Upon reaching Dishoom, I nearly turned away in dismay. \u00a0There was a huge line out the door, and I was told that it would be an hour wait. \u00a0This was at roughly 7 PM. \u00a0I decided to hop in the queue anyways, and I'm glad that I did, because it only took 25 minutes instead of the estimated hour. \u00a0While waiting in line, the restaurant offered its waiting patrons free cups of hot chai tea - much appreciated, especially on a cold London evening.Once I finally got seated, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience of Dishoom. \u00a0Hip, modern, and fancy... yet all the food items on their menu were very reasonably priced. \u00a0Upon my server's suggestion, I ordered a bowl of their signature Black House Daal, a bowl of their Chicken Ruby curry, and some Roomali Roti bread to mop up all the sauces.The Black House Daal was excellent. \u00a0Very rich and hearty, with some nice texture and flavor from the lentils. \u00a0I'm sure there was an ungodly amount of butter in it, but it was oh so creamy and delicious. \u00a0The Chicken Ruby was quite tasty as well (the chicken was amazingly tender, the curry itself had a nice balance of sweet, spicy, and tomatoe-y) but I prefer my curry on the spicy side, so I wished it had packed a little more heat. \u00a0The Roomali Roti was a great choice - nice and fluffy and light, a perfect complement to wipe away all the curry and daal.My server, Ali, was a total star. \u00a0Funny, welcoming, prompt, and professional. \u00a0He did a great job with all his recommendations and made my meal excellent. \u00a0Dishoom management - if you're reading this, give Ali a raise! (or at least a high-five).So why only 4 stars? \u00a0The food was great, and I loved the Daal in particular, but I guess hearing all the hype for Dishoom, I had expected a little more. \u00a0Don't get me wrong - it was still an excellent meal, maybe just not worth the wait (even a shortened 25 minute one).OVERALL: 4/5. \u00a0Great Indian food - very reasonable prices, especially given its location in Covent Garden. \u00a0Very long lines, so you really have to be craving Indian food to make it worthwhile, but I really enjoyed my experience here.",

I don't know if we were lucky or they usually over estimate their wait time but our wait was only about half an hour. Their dishes had so much flavor but my favorite was probably the chicken ruby, bowl of greens, and the lamb chop. I could probably do without the gun powder potatoes though. Thought I'd get really flavorful potatoes but it was just baked potato with a dipping sauce that didn't do much for it. I have to say their service was top notch! Our server Laura (I believe) was such a sweet heart who really took the time to explain the dishes and provide us with information and recommendations. She made us feel welcome and that's more than I can for a lot of our experience here in London.",

The wait for two on a bank holiday, sunny weekend was average, but the queue kept moving. People have mentioned the lemonade that they serve in the queue: it's true, but it's salty.After being seated, my husband and I ordered the greens, basmati rice, roomati roll, the minced lamb and the daal. Hands down the best was the black daal and the greens. I could have eaten a whole bowl of the greens myself! The sauces and spices with each dishes are very carefully balanced and flavorful-- nothing was overbearing from the other and everything on the table was complimentary to the other entrees. After a long day of leisure outside and exercise, I highly recommend ordered one entree and one bread/rice per person. We threw in the greens for color. Fantastic and we will be back!",

Completely unnecessary. \u00a0I calmly replied like an adult that it must have been a miscommunication then. \u00a0The guy just crapped all over our mood with his negative tone and arguing. \u00a0I was dumbfounded as he walked away from the table with his disrespectful tone with us. \u00a0We spent the whole dinner talking about what a terrible place this is. \u00a0We waited an hour in line in the rain for this terrible treatment. \u00a0The food is not worth it. \u00a0You're paying for the ambiance and experience which was bad. \u00a0Either they have bad staff, or they are pressured by management to upsell the customers.Summary: Don't go here! \u00a0Better options elsewhere!",

If you are outside, every 10 minutes they bring around fresh hot chai to keep you warm. \u00a0Within about 25 minutes, they move you to a new waiting area by the bar. \u00a0You hang out there, have a drink, check out the menu, etc. \u00a0By the time you are at your table, you already know your order, probably a little tipsy from your well crafted pre-dinner cocktail and ready to chow down on delicious food.With this menu and with the usual blandness of English food, you really cannot go wrong with anything. \u00a0However a few items are my go-tos:Chicken Ruby: This is what most people confuse as Chicken Tikka Masala. \u00a0Deliciously done and properly with a hint of cashew to thicken the sauce. Chicken Tikka Roll: If you ever had a Kati Roll or Frankie, this is a classic preparation of the street food style from Bombay.Kachumber Salad: A refreshing and citrus salad to help with the palette cleanse between the heavier meal dishesLamb Samosas: Your classic samosas but with Keema instead.Pau Bhaji: Just comfort food for Indians but the burst of flavors is bound to make anyone hungrier for more.Malai Kulfi for dessert: This is the one item that is pretty good but can't beat India. \u00a0It's certainly good and will hit that kulfi craving.",

I'm glad i came though, yummy Indian food!-------------------------------------------------------FOOD:Lamb Samosas: 4/5, We got this while we were waiting for our table at the bar. It was perfectly seasoned and a really good appetizer. You get three pieces so it's pretty small but definitely tasty!House Black Dal: 4/5, It was another really good item! Very different dal than what I usually have. Usually I get yellow dal but this one had much more full lentils and slightly thicker. I'm a big fan of lentil soup so I definitely recommend!Chole Batura: 5/5, This was my favorite meal of the night! The bread that comes alone with it is absolutely delicious, even better than the naan. It was a sizable portion and gave a very fresh feeling. Definitely get this dish!Chicken Ruby: 4/5, Another very decent dish. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it didn't stand out too much. It tasted very classic, so I would recommend getting it if you like chicken!Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: 4/5, This had a very very unique taste. I've never had a chili ice cream and it doesn't hit you at first, but the aftertaste is spicy. Although it wasn't 100% my style I would still recommend just because of how different it was.Naan: 5/5, I love naan and all the variations of naan here were delicious!-------------------------------------------------------PRICE:Lamb Samosas: 4.90 PoundsHouse Black Dal: 5.90Chole Batura: 8.90 PoundsChicken Ruby: 8.50 PoundsDishoom Chocolate Pudding: 6.90Naan: 2.50 PoundsCheese Naan: 3.20 Pounds-------------------------------------------------------SERVICE:4/5, It took like 30-45 minutes of waiting outside and another 15 minutes of waiting at the bar to get a table. It was definitely a very popular place, but once we got a table, they were very fast about getting our food to us! -------------------------------------------------------AMBIANCE:5/5, Very nice ambiance, definitely a little more classy but not too fancy. Can't really come in casual clothing, but it doesn't have to be too formal. Very good for a date!-------------------------------------------------------OVERALL:I definitely recommend coming if you're a fan of Indian food or want to go on a nice date!",

Greeted at the table, they explained the menu to me and were super helpful. As I was dining, I was asked by 4 separate waiters for a total of 6 times if everything was alright. They gave me 4 chai refills (server name was: Moali and the manager was Sarune). Suffice to say, the service was impeccable. I'd go back for the service alone, but getting on to the food....FoodAs a traveler, dining alone is hard. Especially at an Indian or Chinese restaurant where everything is intended to be shared... Or for people like me who just wants to eat everything! I could just sample a small portion of the menu, and I had the calamari as an appetizer and balsamic rice + prawn curry. The calamari was deep fried and very sweet. I was instantly addicted despite knowing how bad it was for me. Superb. The House Chai was also amazing. I had studied abroad in India and this is the closest I've had to authentic Chai. Not too much sugar, milk and just perfect all around. Pro tip: there's unlimited refills until 5pm. The prawn curry was the house special and came with generous portions of gigantic shrimps. The curry was rich and flavorful... I could and did drink much of it by itself. And the balsamic rice... Spectacular. I don't normally comment on rice, perhaps desensitized as I eat it daily. There's something special about the long grain cooked with coconut milk. Lastly my meal was completely free. On Mondays, at the end of your meal, you'll roll a dice and have a gamble with fate. If you get a 6, your meal is on the house! I had no idea this was the case and thank my travelers luck to be here on a Monday!",

Dishoom is beyond any Indian food I have tasted in the U.S. and has elevated my Indian food experience and a spectacular culinary treat. Despite the long queue, staff were very welcoming and friendly. At one point, the host came out to personally chat with us and the hostess even offered hot Indian tea and beverages for the awaiting guests. Well known for their breakfast and buzz for their fried eggs and Bacon Naan Roll, we arrived for dinner instead. Our waiter, Ali, was so helpful in explaining the menu, as everything just sounded so inviting and delicious. We ordered a full table, starting with the Bhang Lassi and Mango & Fennel Lassi drinks. Indian food is best eaten with Lassi as it balances the heat and spice from the curry. For the entrees, we tried the House Black Daal, Chicken Ruby (tender chicken in makhani sauce), Sheekh Kabab (grilled lamb) and dipping Raita (minty cucumber yogurt). I would recommend getting two orders of the stonefire Naan or the steamed Basmati Rice for dipping and mopping the rich, silky curry sauces. Ali also brought out 3 house-made dipping sauces, which really brings out the flavor of the meat dishes. Mouthwatering food and drinks, stellar customer service, clean and charming restaurant decor, all located right in the heart of London. Dishoom is so worth the 13 hour flight from San Diego. Cheers/Chiyars!",

Definitely Indian rather than the more Bangladeshi style that is quite common in London (both are good in my book).We could only get a 6pm table and already the place was packed . It's a bit of a production line but we were seated right away and service was quick and efficient. Drinks came quickly. We ordered our food (being told that everything would come as soon as it was ready) and it all arrived within about 10 minutes.I like the design with the vintage Indian posters dotted around and the low lighting. Josh sticks mixed with spices as the aroma that hits you when you enter.The Bhel (isn't this normally called Bhelpuri?) delicious snack food of crispy rice, herbs and spices which came first was great.We also sampled the Okra fries and calamari. Both pretty good, fairly standard calamari.The lamb biryani was good but not the best I have had (a bit one dimensional and I prefer versions with super tender lamb) but the murgh malai (marinated chicken thighs) was great. The house black daal (signature dish) was rich and creamy. Naan bread was average.So very enjoyable meal overall, we didn't make it to deserts being pretty full at this point. Overall 4 stars for the food, service, ambience and pricing combination.",

To be honest, I didn't expect much from a restaurant in this location, where usually only restaurants exist that cater to tourists who are afraid to try anything beyond their comfort zone. \u00a0 In fact, the restauran would somehow be not misplaced on my (imaginary) list of places-that-are-too-corporate-and-thus-loose-out-on-authenticity...however...despite the quite standardised service and the corporate look, I was feeling well-taken care of, attended to by the waiting staff and showered with delicious Indian food. \u00a0Speaking of the food: I loved it that we were able to order tapas-like food that was tiered up on the table on what I would like to call a table-ladder. We ordered a wide assortment of dishes and the dishes I remember most vividly were the vegetable samosas, the buttered-bread with creamed vegetable-sauce and the char-grilled vegetables...yummy!Having said all this: I still prefer the kinds of restaurant that don't need an entire marketing team to thrive (but will excel simply because of word-of-mouth propaganda). Nevertheless, like I said I was pleasantly surprised by Dishoom and will definitely be back when I have visitors that don't want to go out to the dodgy (yet really authentic) places, but prefer a restaurant with clean toilets, non-greasy tables and efficient service.",

This was my happy experience at Dishoom - we went for a big group meal and all responsibility of choice was relinquished from myself, so I simply got to eat and eat. And man, did we eat!I don't think there was a single dish that we had that I didn't enjoy. The dishes were full of flavour, rich, freshly cooked and plentiful. I particularly enjoyed the lamb kebabs - they were really nicely cooked and delicious with the sauces that came with the meals. I also tried a coconut milk based drink, which I can't quite remember the name of, and it was utterly delicious. It also happened to be the perfect accompaniment to the spicy samosas - they were the hottest thing that we had and were perfect too. Not crazy spicy but plenty of kick!Our service wasn't overly special, as there was a little confusion over drink orders and such, but I couldn't fault the food and the happy feeling my stomach was filled with as we came to the end of our food. The host was really friendly and the vibe of the restaurant was very pleasant, simple striking d\u00e9cor, and no intrusive music - it was perfect for chatting and giggling away. All in all a great experience and delicious food!",

Another amazing meal, the two of us just short of stuffed to the max.Wanna try something really strange, and strangely tasty?Kala Khatta Gola IceAll I can say is what an amazing melange of tastes in one rather simple appearing dish, it's just chipped ice with a few blueberries, right?Oh hella no, order it and find out!5+ stars!As our former Governor Arnold said~ I'll be back!Enjoy!",

Must-orders:- ruby chicken- pau bhaji- roomali rotiBut my boyfriend and I tried at least 7-10 different menu items in the two times we ate there and all of them were great. The dishes run just a tad sweeter than your typical Indian fare (at least in NYC), but nothing is one-note or overdone, just super flavorful. Plus on Mondays they let you roll the dice at the end of your meal to get everything for FREE! We didn't win, but a couple of tables around us did - such a cool idea! The establishment is also crazy well run with seemingly everyone on staff in constant communication with each other via headsets. When the line is especially long outside, they bring out cups of hot tea to tide you over. The wait time estimate includes the last 15-20 minutes which are spent inside at the cozy bar downstairs, where you can get started on drinks. For the quality of food, atmosphere, and service, I expected higher prices. I've recommended it to everyone since coming back to the States.",

We started with the samosas, and frankly they could have come from absolutely anywhere. The thing that improved them was the chutneys.The tamarind chutney in particular took me right back to my time in India. I was also pleased to see that the naan we order arrived in the exact same manner, style and taste as we had in India. But what is with all those people ordering it without butter? Seriously people - it'll be much better with!!We had both the paneer and the chicken tikka. I preferred the paneer but it was a little under seasoned for me - but the texture showed that it was super fresh. The chicken tikka... Well I could tell it had been made properly - no red food dye in sight. But it was a bit bland - I needed to spice all of it up with the chutneys.I'd come back to Dishoom, as I've read enough solid reviews to make me think that we just ordered badly.

It became clear quickly that it is a very popular spot in London, with over an hour wait for a table. Good sign then, if people are lining up out the door, it must be good. The hostess offered chai tea to us while we stood outside freezing, which was a nice touch. The inside is casual and cozy but vibrant as well. I went with friends who have been before, so I basically tried everything they ordered in a family style sort of set up. The food definitely exceeded my expectations, it was delicious! I tried several things, from vegetable samosas to chicken tikka, and I was pleasantly surprised with it all. I didn't think I would be one for Indian food, considering the heavy emphasis on spices, but it was all very flavorful. It might not be my first choice in cuisine for London, but it was certainly enjoyable no less.",

We were told then too that you can make reservations up until 6pm so we decided to leave it and come back the next day, ahead of yet another movie premiere, with a reservation.So the next day we turned up at 5pm and the place was busy but not full. Since it was so early for dinner, we just had a few things. We shared some lamb samosas, and I had paneer tikka, and my husband had chicken tikka. We also shared a garlic naan.The samosas had a good taste, and went well with the lovely chutneys, but judging by the slight softness and the speed, they were not fried to order.My paneer tikka was fine, but the paneer was a bit bland and the spice paste just didn't really stick to it well so it was mainly plain paneer. I love paneer so it wasn't a total lost cause, but it took a fair bit of the chili chutney to make it tasty. The bread was the highlight, fresh and just like we had in India. We spent most of our time watching the man making the bread at the tandoor, as we were sat next to it.I didn't have any of the chicken tikka, as it was thigh meat and had skin - just not my thing.It was pretty expensive for what we had - it came to around \u00a330, with our drinks (a Limca and a Thums Up). I think I'll try it again, but I'm not running back.",

    "text": "I love it. I just love it. Anyone who knows me knows that I love it and I can't even put my finger on why? Especially because this review is solely focusing on their breakfast offerings. Of all the Dishoom locations this is probably the one with the least ambience and decor and for that reason you're usually more likely to get a table. Top tip: Even though you can't book in the evening unless you have 6+ in your party, you can in the morning so book your breakfast table to avoid a wait or disappointment! They do breakfast cocktails but do not start serving these until 11am so if you're looking to get started early - make sure you head in around this time. I have gone through pretty much everything on their breakfast menu by now and I have to say that the bacon naan with egg is still a winner. Those fluffy naan breads with the chutney inside just transforms the traditional bacon sarnie. I'm usually of the opinion that if it's not broke don't fix it but I'm so glad they fixed it. It's beautiful. The big bombay is their take on a 'full English' and it's massive. Home made beans or peoples take on beans is one of my pet peeves in trendy breakfast spots but the beans here are absolutely delicious and I have no idea what it is they have done to the eggs but again - taste sensation. I wont go through everything on the menu as that would be boring. The only thing I'd say is personally I really dislike their porridge and would avoid that but then, I've seen other people loving it so it depends on your personal taste. Personally, I'm not a fan of the coffee there either so usually opt for the freshly squeezed If you ask for a loyalty card you can get a free bacon naan after you've had breakfast there five times. Well worth it!",

Absolutely! Not only was it worth it but we came back a few days later for a late lunch and a shorter 40 minute wait. There was amazing and their specialty cocktails, all of which we tried, were unbelievable. And, it's not very expensive. Good food, good drinks, what more can we ask for? Service was attentive and they brought around mint and chai tea while we were waiting outside. We tried Indian at a few other London restaurants and they did not stack up to Dishoom. If you like gimlets try their specialty gimlet! Best I've ever had. Celery bitters is the secret ingredient. You will not be disappointed and you'll be glad you waited.",

Also, the quality was much better here!First of all, they have a great waiting system. They gave us a remote that buzzes when your table is ready. When it buzzed, we went straight downstairs. I'm not sure what they use their upstairs for (maybe reservations) but they were directing all walk-ins downstairs. Second of all, the staff is amazing. Everyone that helped us was very kind. Our waitress, in particular, knew the menu very well and was very sweet. Third of all, the food was INCREDIBLE. I got a mango lassi and the Bedmi Puri. My dad got the Chicken Curry and an order of naan. They were both incredible and plenty of food for two people. The Chicken Curry, in particular, was very flavorful and pairs very well with both a Puri and naan. The mango lassi was my favorite part. It tasted just like we got it in India - very well done, sweet and tasty. I would recommend this place to everyone that visits London!",

It ended up being a social experience, talking to others in line, so the time went by quickly. Probably better with a group. The food was indeed fantastic, which explains the popularity. The chicken tikka was so well seasoned that every bite was precious. Also enjoyed the ruby chicken curry, calamari appetizer and the nan. Plenty of tasty things on the menu, all very creatively prepared. Definitely a cut above some of the other more traditional Indian restaurants we tried while in London.

We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11:55 and just barely got a table for 2! The place was packed. We ordered:-Rose & Pistachio Lassi (must order) -Pav Bhaji (must order) -Lamb Biriyani (must order but try the chicken instead)-Ruby Chicken Curry-Palak Paneer -Naan The food was all 5 stars. I highly recommend ordering the biriyani. It tasted just like my mom's homemade biriyani which takes 2 days to make- with the exception of Dishoom's lamb being a little tough and the cashews not being roasted. When I took my first bite, I was sent back 15 years to my childhood. It was incredible. Next time I come here I want to order the chicken biriyani. Now that I am back in Boston, I am craving that rose and pistachio lassi. As soon as it was served to me, I slurped it down in under 1 minute. The rose wasn't over powering at all and the lassi was light but had amazing flavor. Next time we are in London, we will definitely be back here! What was really nice too was that the whole restaurant is decorated with family memorabilia-even the bathroom stalls!",

I mean, the food here is phenomenal and worth your time, but if you're visiting on vacation, you don't have all the time in the world to be spending it in line!!! Make a reservation! After 5:45pm, they only allow reservations for parties of greater than 6. However, if you have less than 6, you can still make a reservation for any time before 5:45pm. The inside is insanely hip and historic at the same time. I love the modern accents that feature decor that look like period-pieces from the 1920s. It also helps that you're greeted by the most aromatic and inviting smells as soon as you step foot into this establishment.The food speaks for itself. You won't be disappointed by anything you order. Some of the food is so innovative and different, but not lacking at all in flavor. I was so surprised that the chicken tikka masala did not have sauce! The chicken pieces were just expertly soaked/braised/infused/whatever with the flavors that the sauce is still discernible, even if you're not seeing it. It's quite an incredible culinary feat, if you ask me. Also, I loved seeing the open kitchen downstairs. So efficient, spacious, and clean.",

Once we made it to the front of the line we were invited to have drinks and snacks at the bar downstairs. This was after about 30 minutes of waiting outside. We sat at stools near the bar but decided to just wait until seated to order any alcohol. About 10 minutes after we moved downstairs, we were shown to our dining table. Our server was very knowledgeable and happily shared suggestions and recommendations. Everything is served family-style and the portions are smaller so it's recommended 4-5 dishes for 2 people. We started with the lamb samosas, which come 3 per order. The outside was crisp and the lamb was well-seasoned and plentiful inside. We ordered the mahi tikka, adwahi lamb, and the ruby chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan.*Mahi tikka: this is sustainable Asian basa fillet in a subtle yoghurty marinade. This was a nice and light dish and tasted good with the extra lime. Even though this was good it was my least favorite and I let my husband eat most of it.*Adwahi lamb: The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. This was deliciously spicy! Really generous portion too. The lamb was well seasoned and tender.*Ruby chicken: Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce. This was my favorite dish! Very rich and flavorful and creamy. Best mopped up with garlic naan! Lots of tender, well-flavored chicken mixed in.*garlic naan: Some of the best garlic naan I've ever had! We ordered one order with butter and one without. I'm sure you can guess which was preferred at our table! The naan was soft and well-cooked and evenly flavored with garlic.When visiting London, Indian food is always a solid option and look no further than Dishoom to provide a 5 star dining experience! From getting in line until walking out the door, we both felt well-taken care of and that we were valued customers.",

Not your prototype Indian restaurant, more street food like. Gotta try the Indian coke (thumbs up) too. Slight downer however was the standing in line for more than an hour and further waiting inside with a buzzer-device, felt more or less like mass processing. 4 Stars well deserved nevertheless.",

    "text": "Everyone always said London had some world-class Indian food, but I was skeptical as to how much it outstripped the States in this regard until I actually came. Dishoom is a wildly popular Indian restaurant with many locations throughout the city. My friend and I chose to visit the Covent Garden one as it was most convenient for us. We secured \"lunch\" reservations for 5:45PM, effectively making this an early dinner (and this is the way to go as they don't take dinner reservations, and the line was out the door for walk ins while we were seated immediately; the lunch and dinner menu are the same).We ordered the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black house daal to share - a greatest hits of the menu, if you will. Everything was phenomenal, with depths of flavor that I never tasted before in Indian food, all melding together with none of the harsh notes that I've sometimes found NYC Indian food suffers from. Somehow even the naan was orders of magnitude better than the ones I've had in the US.Both of us loved the restaurant so much that we had to come back the next morning to try breakfast (and more lunch). We arrived and were seated immediately at ~11:15. My friend and I ordered a keema per eedu, breakfast lassi, and bottomless house chai. Everything was, once again, phenomenal. The keema is quite heavy and comes with two buttered buns. Even something as simple as the chai was great - I'd never understood the appeal of it until I had a glass here.Of course, we also had to order off the lunch menu once they started taking orders at 11:45 since it was our last day. For that, we split the roti, chicken ruby (again), and the pau bhaji. Once again, everything was amazing and we cleaned our plates. For dessert, we each had a kulfi, which was a nice, light way to end a large meal.Please bring Dishoom to NYC! Until then, I'll be dreaming about this place.",

    "text": "Located in bustling Covent Garden, Dishoom is likely the most popular Indian restaurant in all of London. 1. What is the restaurant like? Dishoom offers a nice ambience that caters to a diverse patron base: families, friend groups, and significant others on a special date. Upstairs and downstairs seating is available. 2. What is the wait like?On a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm, we were quoted a 1 hr wait. We expected that we would have a chance to explore the area after putting our names down, but Dishoom requires that all customers wait in line. To placate hungry customers in line, the restaurant offers warm chai tea and small bites. 3. What should you order?According to our waiter, the restaurant's famed dishes are the chicken ruby, prawns, house black daal, and calamari. We ordered several dishes suggested by our waiter including the calamari, chicken ruby, house black daal, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, cheese naan, and garlic naan. The calamari was a nice starter that we enjoyed with the various dips, especially the spicy house sauce. Among the other plates we ordered, our favorite was the chicken ruby, which was pleasantly less creamy than the chicken tikka masala that we are accustomed to but loaded with just as much flavor. It served as the perfect accompaniment to the naan. We liked the other plates that we ordered, though we would have preferred the spicy lamb chops to have been cooked a tad less longer. Overall, we were extremely happy with our meal and left with content bellies. Dishoom was a fantastic first meal upon our arrival in London, and we would undoubtedly return.",

We arrived around 7:45 and the wait was a full hour, outdoors. They serve you a nice warm chai tea while waiting, which was lovely. I really wasn't sure what to expect as we peered through the windows watching people eat. It looked rather crowded from the outside peeking in but it's actually huge and there's a whole bottom floor with more seating.I took one bite of the curry and completely understood why people wait an hour out in the cold and rain to eat at this place. It was hands down the best curry I've had anywhere in the world, including India and Thailand. I'm usually pretty good at guessing ingredients in dishes but I had no idea what they put in here to make it so amazing. The rest of the food was also very good, including the lentils, which I don't usually like. The lentils had a nice texture, not mushy like what I've had in the past. If we had more time in London, I would have come back here just to eat the curry again- it was that good.",

HA! - Mahi Tikka: This was my order and it was SO good. \u00a0The fish is cooked perfectly, leaving it juicy, flaky, and tender.Our server was friendly and the food came out super fast. \u00a0My husband, who is normally not a huge fan of Indian food, could not stop raving about this place and has recommended it to several of his friends who were visiting London. \u00a0Now that says a lot!",

When you arrive, if it's anywhere near a meal hour you'll find a line. However, I'm here to tell you that you must overcome any concern you have about the line, I don't care if it's raining sleet. Get in that line soldier and stick it out, the victory of incredibly delicious food will make the pain and suffering fade immediately. We had the followingButtered Plain NaanBlack LentilsLamb Sheek KabobPaneer curryVegetarian samosas We loved everything. While my wife and I prefer yellow daal, this black daal was amazing. The naan was very fresh with excellent flavor and a touch of crispy. \u00a0I could have eaten 3 orders of the Lamb without the benefit of any sauces, but the sauces are so damn good I used them anyway. The vegetation samosas were clear and away the most flavorful and balanced (potato to other ingredients) we've ever eaten, a great crutch in the crust followed by incredible flavor. I really wish I'd had room left to get an order of the lamb samosas.The paneer curry (that's right cheese pieces in curry) was terrific and would satisfy anyone regardless of whether they're vegetarian or not. The bar is where they send you to wait after you've made it in the door (3-7 mins) and they do a pretty good job there as well. We can't wait to head back to London so we can return to Dishoom.",

While we were waiting they gave us delicious hot masala chai. Plus the free wi-fi kept us occupied.We were seated downstairs and the decor was awesome. Everything has such a great unique touch. For food, we had the chili cheese toast, gunpowder potatoes, ruby chicken, rice, naan, and roomali roti. It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people. The cheese toast and ruby chicken was phenomenal. Honestly some of the best indian food I've had in a while!We also got a bottle of wine.. everything was pretty decently priced for being in the heart of london and a fancy indian restaurant!",

    "text": "So, \u00a0I don't know if I didn't get a taste of some of the magic mushrooms other reviews did in order to take this place so highly, but overall I found Dishoom to be pretty disappointing. Upon entering, the decor is nice and funky. Like someone else mentioned, \u00a0it's got a cool speakeasy vibe going on. I was really excited, but let down by the service from the beginning. Despite being pretty busy, \u00a0we were seated fairly quickly (probably only 15 minutes wait after being told 25-30), but that's when things just took a downturn. The guy who seemed to be in charge of seating seemed pretty disappointed when we said we hadn't ordered any drinks while waiting in the area by the bar, and then after he plonked us at a table, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to notice us and give us menus. But, I tried my best not to let it bother me, as I was excited for their \"Haleem\" dish, which was touted as so special and flavorful. From their online menu: \"for 8 hours we let the wheat, lamb and lentils simmer with precise quantities of coriander, turmeric, cumin and many other aromatic spices. Then the ingredients are pounded to intertwine and infuse the spices, release the flavour, and create a thick, smooth texture, almost a savoury porridge.\" My partner ordered the haleem and when I tasted it, I really expected a total flavor explosion in my mouth. Instead, I got an underwhelming mouth of mush. I didn't have a problem with the texture, as it was as described, but I was really expecting more punch and more depth to a dish that was allegedly cooked down for 8 hours with spices. Just...okay. This chef's special, btw, came at a lovely premium of \u00a316.50. Yes, you heard me right. \u00a316.50. For a child's sized portion of porridge. For a drink, I treated myself to the Bombay Pimm's, which was basically just ginger beer in a highball glass with some bits and bobs thrown in the bottom. Waste of \u00a37.50.I also ordered the chicken ruby, which many people here totally raved about, but I also found it devoid of any depth of flavor. It was just any old tomato based sauce to me, and I was let down. Average tasting, but nice to soak up with the naan, which was delicious. Also disappointing, was dessert. A pineapple and black pepper crumble. I was excited for the combo, but when I dug in, found that all I'd really been served was a ramekin of dense, sugary flour crumble with the tiniest layer of unripe pineapple at the very bottom (bleh). I needed to drown it in the provided custard sauce in order to provide any moisture. Also, didn't even taste the slightest hint of black pepper. Really, aside from the annoying service, Dishoom was nothing awful, but definitely underwhelming. Mediocre food and mediocre service, so no, not a very good value at all. I feel as though I could have gotten better, cheaper Indian food somewhere else in London where the staff would have paid a bit more attention. \u00a0At the end of the night, I could tell someone at Dishoom knew deep down they'd screwed up, because the owner came over with discount vouchers to placate us. However, given what I think of Dishoom, the option of $10 off a $40 meal at a completely different location isn't exactly very gracious, in my books. Right now, I certainly wouldn't rush to go back (certainly not to the Covent Garden location), but maybe one night if feeling a little tipsy, I'd give Dishoom another try. .",

The star was actually the Black Dall...crushed lentils in a great sauce. The starter calamari was good with the three sauces but it was not wow...just nice and crispy and not oily.I waited in line for about an hour before being served....and I was there at 6:30. Place is noisy as well. But if you don't mind waiting and the noise...I would highly recommend this place.Plus the owners are really nice people.

    "text": "First of all, Dishoom had me at the name. We came to celebrate after getting engaged (!!!). We had initially tried to stop by for dinner on a weeknight around 9pm and the wait was 2 hours. I love me some Indian food but when a girl's hungry she can't wait that long for food. I'm glad we came back 'cause a late lunch at Dishoom was perfect, and we didn't have to wait! This has gotta be one of the swankiest Indian restaurants I've ever seen. Love the old Bollywood movie posters and vintage humorous ads on the walls. The mirrors above the kitchen are sexy. Even the bathrooms were decorated expertly.The food. Now, when I'm in London I always eat Indian food cause Indian food in America just doesn't compare. Dishoom is definitely one of the best Indian restaurants I've eaten at in London, and quite possibly the world - outside of my mama's kitchen, and of course, the Motherland. We had a terribly difficult time picking what we wanted to eat because everything sounded good. The pau bhaji was delicious. For something that is so simple, the chefs at Dishoom managed to elevate it into a spicy, sour, exciting appetizer. For entrees we ordered the Chicken Ruby and the Kacchi Lamb biriyani. The Chicken Ruby, Dishoom's version of tikka masala, was finger-lickingly divine, especially with a perfectly made roomali roti. The sauce was well seasoned and had just the right amount of butter. The Kacchi lamb biriyani (made Hyderabadi style) was on point. My Hyderabadi fianc\u00e9 (!) verified its authenticity. The lamb was tender and moist and the rice was delicately flavored. You must get raita with biriyani, and this raita did not disappoint. Our server was very friendly and sweet. Prices are very reasonable for a London restaurant. When we left, full and happy, we saw a line of about 25-30 people waiting to enter for happy hour. \u00a0Overall, Dishoom deserves to take all my stars. The next time in London, I'll definitely be back.",

We got the Black House Daal (lentils), Chicken Ruby, Spicy Lamb Chops, a garlic and a plain naan - 3 of us. Each dish was so flavorful, rich and served hot! (which I love). The Chicken Ruby (4 pieces) is the second best chicken I have ever eaten - so tender and juicy. The Spicy Lamb Chops (3 pieces) with pomegranate was so good we ordered a second 2/3's into our meal. I would definitely give Dishoom 5-stars if it weren't for the wait.For the foreigners (Americans) who dine here: (since the host said 75% of the people who eat here are foreigners)- the wait is long! the host said the shortest wait times are before 5:30pm- there is free wifi in line and in the restaurant- the hosts are friendly and pass out free House Chai to the line- reservations are only permitted for parties of 6+- the waits are just as long at other Dishoom locations (we checked out the King's Cross location the day before and the wait was just as long)- but inside, the service and ambiance are great",

    "text": "Proudly writing my first review for London. I had no idea Yelp would be so useful in finding the perfect dinner place in London. Visited this place on a Saturday night after seeing the Yelp reviews. Place was crowded and we waited about 20 mins. But absolutely no complaints, had a great time. This place has kitchen open till 11 pm which is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting London. Of course, greater London has several hundred Indian places that are probably even better than Indian food in India, \u00a0I am sure you can find individual dishes better than this place in small restaurants scattered around London, but this place offers a sweet combination of Bollywood, upscale atmosphere and tasty Indian food. So I would definitely recommend going here at least once while you are in London.We tried the Pav bhaji, Roomali roti (Yes, they have roomali roti! - \u00a0which is certainly a rare sight in the US, Black daal, cheese toast and Kulfi. The black daal, as other reviews say, was really very nice. I really liked the Pav bhaji too, it was pretty close to what I have had on Bombay streets (buttery, tart and spicy). The roomali was very nice, and it was also fun to see the roti maker flipping the rotis through the glass window in the kitchen. I would rate the Kulfi the least, although it was well placed in an Indian style glass on a stick, it seemed the frozen lot and not fresh. I would probably go for the gujju style chocolate mouse instead. The cream cheese toast was average. They also have some chaat (Bhel puri etc.) on the menu. They have a full bar downstairs, but no draught beers. Doesn't matter much as being carb heavy doesn't go with the already carb heavy Indian cuisine. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the music and food, even the lamb and chicken dishes. People were sprawling, and not just Indians - it was good mix of people, mostly young. Very refreshing to see an Indian restaurant proudly portraying Indian art, bollywood memorabilia and celebrating Indian culture. I especially loved the ambiance. Well decorated, flattering lighting and some amazing Bollywood memorabilia from 70s and 80s. Great for a date night as well.",

    "text": "Dishoom has everything you need from Mumbai. I used to work in Mumbai for a few years. And Dishoom actually made me nostalgic. Everything at this place including the tables and chairs, remind me of some cafe in Colaba, Mumbai. Absolutely Indian. The house Chai was fantastic. I don't think I have had Indian Chai like that any where else in London. As Dishoom made me nostalgic, I thought I'd get adventurous and ordered some very Mumbai-ish stuff. Vada pav! Can you believe it? Vada pav is India's answer to Burger. And I used to hog lots of them from the street side vendor near my office in Mumbai. And I have to admit that Dishoom has made it only better. They served it with some chillies and chilli powder. And it is not for those who don't eat spicy food, it is authentically hot! Specifically made for the Indian tongue. Great combination with the Chai. I also tried the Pav Baji and I couldn't believe it. This has got to be someone from Mumbai cooking. Loved every bit of it. But I wasn't done yet. I wanted to try out their Naan and some curries. But Dishoom is not a traditional curry house. It is a cafe and they openly admit that it is a cafe, so they have more snacks and chat and grills and frankies than traditional meals and curries. I went for the Matter Paneer and Garlic Naan. Wow! Flavour rich! It made me believe that I was in India. \u00a0But after all that spice rich flavours in my mouth I was still yearning for more. I chose Cinnamon Ice cream for dessert and yet again I drifted away in my fantasy Mumbai. Everything was served in less than 10 minutes. And I was extremely pleased. This is heaven for Indian food lovers and those who have a connection with Mumbai.",

I will say that if you have a chance to book a table, do so. While I have been and immediately gotten a table, there have been times when, since it's London, they say it will be a two-hour wait (although, when they said that we only ended up waiting for 30-45 minutes). Sometimes there's a line out the door and down the street, but it's definitely worth the wait!",

I had been wanting to check it out since my last business trip when two separate co-workers had tried it and came back with positive reviews. Our party of four had to wait a little over an hour to get in, but the time went by quickly. The hostesses that managed the line were very friendly, and I loved the chai and mint tea they brought out to the line to keep us warm.My favorites of the night were the fried skate cheeks and okra from the appetizer/small plates menu as well as the lamb biryani and chicken ruby (curry) from the main entrees menu. Heck, everything was delicious though; I really doubt that you can go wrong with your ordering here.We rounded out the evening with sulfis all around for dessert. The pistachio sulfi was absolutely marvelous; you've got to try it!Anyway, I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in London. So, so good!",

Yes, this is bold and dangerous at an Indian restaurant. However, the food was colorful, flavorful, aromatic, and some dishes, not all, were spicy. The cheese naan can and should be dipped in just about any of the sauces accompanied by the food. Order a kingfisher beer which compliments the spicy food. Don't be afraid to use your hands!

The food. I ordered chili bread(?) appetizer, ruby chicken, basmati rice, and garlic naan. My main, rice and naan actually came out before my starter, which was a little surprising, but worked out fine as I dipped the bread in the ruby sauce. Chili bread was tasty, but really nothing to get excited about. Rice was very good and cooked to perfection. Garlic naan was good, but a little thick around the edges. I like a little bit of heat with my Indian food (usually a vindaloo guy), but the waiter warned me that non of their dishes were overtly spicy hot. \u00a0The ruby chicken was supposed to be one of the spicer dishes available. It had great flavor and was very tender, but was missing the heat I really wanted. They did serve some little sauces which included a pepper one, that did help a bit. I have found in general the British are a little tame when it comes to adding heat, so I'm sure this is partially why there is nothing \"hot\" on the menu. Prices are a little much for the portion sizes. High quality food, lacking heat, but tasty.",

And wonderful if you don't want to smell like curry after your meal.I once dined at Dishoom twice in a week, that's how good this Bombay-inspired eatery is. Situated in Covent Garden, it's super central and good for groups up to six but beyond that be prepared to split up.Not to be missed: pau bhaji and the lamb biryani (make sure to pair with raita!)I'm hoping someday soon to join the Bombay Breakfast Club (yup, Dishoom's open in the morning!) Bacon naan roll, anyone?",

The food and service is great. I went at lunch time/ mid week so I didn't have to stand in line. I think when you stand in line for food you are often let down as you expect so much from standing in line. People who have had to stand in line to eat here may give this place less points. I do love this place and can't wait to try again. ps their house made kulfi is amazing! Cheese naan so tasty and very cheesy in a good way! yay for Dishoom! my favorite indian in London! although it is not traditional indian food it is one special place.",

I came here for lunch and was really looking forward to trying some Indian curry. There is also a breakfast menu here that looked really good and one of my regrets was not being able to try that.I came without a reservation on a Monday and there was a slight wait, but was able to get seated within 10 minutes. I ordered the Chicken Ruby with steamed Basmati rice. By far the best curry I have ever had and went well with the rice (I should have ordered naan too!). To my surprise, when I got my bill, I found out they had an event on Mondays where you roll a die and if you get a certain number, your meal is free! However, my luck wasn't great that day...whole meal came out to about \u00a311. I would recommend this place to anyone exploring London and looking for good Indian food!",

So when I was set on a mission to organize a much needed dinner date with my girlfriends, Dishoom was definitely a top choice with excellent reviews, not to mention its website which kind of got me captivated.

Our server was very friendly, but was noticeably more friendly to my South aAsian friends than he was to me--the only non-Asian at the table. I highly recommend ordering a variety of dishes and sharing them so you can taste a little bit of everything. Both the Kings Cross and Covent Garden locations are spacious and beautifully decorated, and most importantly, they take reservations. If you don't manage to reserve a table and get caught in the queue outside, they pass out chai to keep you warm, which is a great bonus. Can't wait to go back and try breakfast!",

The house black daal (\u00a34.90) was soul-warming, thick and mildly spiced, the ultimate comfort food. It was perfect scooped up with chewy roomali roti (\u00a31.90) and naan (\u00a31.90), both freshly baked. I think the thicker naan held the daal better than the roti, though both were delicious. I couldn't stop eating it, even on a scorching hot day! The naan and roti were also great with the chutneys on the table. I'd accept the cold London winters if I could eat this every day. Dessert was just meh. If a dessert is more expensive than my entree, it better be amazing, and the pineapple & black pepper crumble (\u00a35.20) wasn't. That's not to say it was awful -- it wasn't too sweet and I could taste the black pepper in the topping. It paired well with the cinnamon ice cream, but after a heavy meal, I would have preferred just the ice cream, or one of the kulfis.The atmosphere was certainly unique. Loved the Bombay cafe decor. I never felt rushed, although I've heard the waits for dinner get quite long!",

In a town full of Indian restaurants I must say this place really delivers!They serve modern versions of the Mumbai areas classic dishes. The portions aren't big as they are meant for sharing. It is usually really busy so you might have to wait for a table, especially if you are a group. Everytime we have visited they have told us that we have to wait 30-40 minutes for a table but this has never happened. We have usually ended up waiting for only ca. 20-30 minutes max! They have a bar downstairs where you can enjoy some extremely tasty Lassi's while waiting (with or without rum). While waiting I would highly recommend the \"chili & cheese on toast\"!",

At 10am on weekdays you'll see couples brunching, singles with or without laptops (free wifi btw, which they call 'chaifi' hahaha), it's all very relaxed, the restaurant feels airy and bright, and why hello there, BOTTOMLESS CHAI FROM 8AM - 5PM (MONDAY TO THURSDAY)! Breakfast at dishoom is truly underrated. And ultimately, the food's just better when it's less busy.For breakfast, get the egg naan roll. 4 out of 5 times it's done perfect - gooey, runny yolk, and who knew cream cheese went with fried eggs? The magic really is the fresh herbs and tartness of the tomato chili jam thing, it's addictive. And of course, fluffy yet dense naan with just the right amount of chew. That and a cup of chai.. best way to start the day.Lunch and dinner, where do I begin?Okra fries - crispy, deep fried veggies, what's not to like?Pau bahji - veg could've had more flavour but the bread's a buttered, fluffy cloud!Skate cheeks - ah, are my favourite! So so juicy, tender and that tamarind!!!Mahi Tikka - so moistttt and super tastyNaan's better than the roti (just personal preference really)Feel like I've tried more dishes but I guess they weren't as memorable. Overall, I really like Dishoom (both here and Shoreditch) but it's definitely anglicised indian fare, so don't expect anything super punchy! Oh and try the kulfi! It really is just frozen condensed milk but the consistency sure it satisfying!Also, having been to this branch and the one in Shoreditch multiple times, somehow the food is always slightly better here, but the ambience / decor in Shoreditch really takes the cake.",

    "text": "I discovered Dishoom while searching the internet for exceptional Indian food in London during a recent trip. The details -- from the rotary ceiling fans to the steel cups to the pervasive aroma -- all intend to transport you to the Persian-style cafes of Bombay, India. As a side note, the menu is really well-done; you can almost sense the passion in flowery descriptions of the exotic offerings. Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly hungry unfortunately so we only ordered a few dishes. The Awadhi Lamb Biryani, a fragrant rice preparation, was decent but didn't blow me away. The meat was fairly soft and had strong taste, but the dish was slightly dry overall so I would order yogurt-based Raita on the side. The Mattar Paneer was fantastic, with spongy morsels of cheese soaked in a tangy tomato-and-pea sauce. The signature Black House Daal was the best course we tried by far and boasted a strong sourness that was counter-intuitive but added to the rich flavor. Get an order of Roomali Roti, a soft and stretchy flatbread, to soak up all the broth and spices.",

The line to get it is out the door despite there being plenty of other restaurants around.My wait was an hour and a half. The waiters do come out and serve Indian tea which is great while standing out on a chilly night. Once you are called in they direct you to the downstairs bar for an additional 10 minute wait. For the food, I ordered: Vada Pai as an appetizer. It came in a nice warm toasted bun. This potato sandwich was tasty. Had the right amount of spices and flavor. Its small enough to eat on your own or cut in half and share.Lamb kabab was not good at all. The lamb was greatly lacking in flavor and was severely over cooked. It was tough and practically inedible. Chicken Ruby was delicious! \u00a0The chicken was very tender and marinated perfectly. I ate this with naan and a roomali roll. All in all the place is great, food is good and prices are very reasonable. Worth the wait if theres a line to get in. Will definitely visit on my next trip to London.",

Really enjoyed the ambiance.Now to the food. Ordered the Chicken Ruby and Bryani, lamb Samosas for appetizer.Portions were small but the food overall was good. Not spectacular as you would expect from the reviews, but just good, even at the spicy level. What makes this place special is everything else. Great place to hang with friends, drink and be merry.

    "text": "Ah Dishoom... Where do I begin?!I suppose I'd better jump on the band wagon and shout about the breakfast! This really is one of my favourite places to go for breakkie in London! Served until 11am, the selection of classic breakfast favourites with a twist really hit the spot and come at a very reasonable price! My favourite is the sausage naan with a bottomless chai, coming to less than \u00a310, but there is also the deliciously sticky porridge and a selection of eggs spiced to perfection! For lunch or dinner I'm less keen on Dishoom. The distinctive flavours of the breakfast are not repeated across the main meals menu, and for the price id rather save some money and sacrifice the dining 'experience' and head to my local curry house for generous portions that really hit the spot! At the mention of experience, that's really what you're choosing when you decide to go to Dishoom. Decked out with spine tingly accuracy like a British Raj club house, you'll be greeted by wafts of incense and carafes of water in tin cups. Where I find Dishoom disappointing, though, is that this experience is not always continues by the staff. Service is often slow (and strangely more so the quieter it is!) and mostly served by a hipster with a 'too cool for this' attitude, which somewhat dulls the excitement of going to one of London's current favourite food venues! My advice for those of you thinking of going to Dishoom? Go for breakfast, but only if you don't have to rush to be somewhere before lunch- and you'll love it!",

And people watching we did (I'll get back to this in a second). The bar makes beautiful drinks and we had many. The menu is just mesmerizing. It's like an old colonial restaurant's menu in Bombay India. So tantalizing you want to order everything.We started with an almost sweet and sour fried calamari. Wow was it good. I could have ordered two more of these puppies and called it a day.We had their specialty of the house which is called black house daal and is a curried lentil dish that is out of this world. Ordered with garlic naan it is scrumptious.A chicken salad and a few more beers and this was a lunch to remember.The atmosphere is charming! Not taking itself to seriously it has great old school colonial art, writings on the walls that is humorous and very Indian.I went downstairs where the kitchen and yet another bar is. Charming is all I can say.The service is top notch, but that brings me back to the people watching; so our young attractive waitress was taking such good care of us, but then this super good looking guy comes in and takes a seat right next to us. This young man turned every females head in the entire restaurant. My wife (who is old enough to be this boys mother) lost her breath. Our waitress was so gaga'ed by this \"HUNK\" she was worthless from that point on. I'm not going to lower this five star review due to some primal instinct. That's not fair to Dishoom. This was a culinary high point of our trip to England. We are so happy we ate here.BTW, he was gorgeous!",

As for lunch if you like indian food, you are going to love Dishoom.The House Chai is a cardamom flavored milky tea and it's amazing, as is the Chai Chocolate, both of which you can have with dipping toast.Whenever i pass by and i don't have time to sit in I always get a chocolate chai for takeaway :)",

I've been to Dishoom for dinner, which is great. but for the purpose of this review - let's talk breakfast! There's three across London (Covent Garden, Shoreditch and Kings X), I went to the one in Kings Cross branch. The building itself is beautiful and one of the largest in London. In what used to be a transit shed, the restaurant has been built to include cobble floor from the original stables with exposed wrought iron beams and high ceilings. Black and white photos and memorabilia adorn the walls much the style of its now trademark style.The breakfast food is outrageously good but there was only ever one dish for me - the bacon naan roll. I'd heard great things about it and it did not disappoint! The bacon was spot on for me - I like my bacon erring on the rubbery side but with a slight crisp \u00a0- and the naan was soft, fluffy yet slightly charred. All this coupled with the sweet and tangy chilli jam made me one very happy customer! Other dishes on the menu include akuri - spicy scrambled eggs and kerjriwal - fried eggs on chilli toast. Both, i'm told, are delicious but nothing comes close to that bacon naan!",

They were very welcoming and they made sure you had everything you needed. It's A-La-Carte, so wait to be seated, order and pay at the table. 2. Price- this place is affordable, and not expensive at all. For two people, you'll pay about \u00a330, but that depends on how much you order though. 3. Ambiance- modern and hip. There are two stories to this particular restaurant. I guess you can say there is a Ground level and a Lower Ground Level. Or perhaps as we better understand in the states, 1st floor and a basement. Haha. Dress code is casual. 4. Food- we had cheese naan, Gunpowder potatoes, Chicken Ruby, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Vegetable Biryani. My favorite were the potatoes, and the Tikka. Everything was very flavorful and I have to say, it's the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to.5. Cleanliness- superb. I can't complain.",

Yes. \u00a0Is the paneer just as good and cheaper elsewhere? Likely. \u00a0Can you take it all and put it under one roof? \u00a0Well that's what Dishoom does. \u00a0The great quality across the board for a higher dollar price. \u00a0It's the way to go, no doubt.",

Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.",

Food: 5/5! Actually all of the dishes were delicious, not a single one fell short. We had the okra fries and calamari, and both were fried perfectly, but very oily. Okra fries were almost like yam fries! The chicken tikka was good, but not spectacular. The lamb kebabs were better I think, but personally not a huge fan of lamb. The lamb biryani was one of my faves! The rice is amazingly blended with different flavours, and we added Raita to it too (felt almost like chicken over rice. We also ordered a bowl of greens which was actually very good and helped balance out the heavy meat dishes. I highly recommend the garlic naan and the matter paneer, those were the other highlights of the night. Drinks wise I really liked the mango lassi, and it was a perfect balance for all the spicy and oily dishes. If you're in London this is definitely a must try!",

A club line and you need to head to the bar first before being seated. Why can't you just wait for an open table if you don't want to go to the bar. Besides my disapproval of the seating process, the food was delicious. The black daal is supposed to be the house special but I thought it tasted like bean soup. However the chicken curry and the rice with lamb was amazing. The garlic naan was best naan I ever had and wished each serving was more than 2. Going to come back here before my trip ends.",

The wait was a little long (for a Sunday evening) and they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 6. However, while you wait you can have some chai (it has more spices than usual), water, or lemon water. Which was a nice thing while you wait. We waited about an hour for a Sunday evening around 9:30. The menu had a lot of options, some traditional and some they have made their own versions of. From everything we ordered - the seekh kabobs were the best.",

    "text": "Dishoom was our first stop in London for dinner and well worth the wait. With 700+ reviews already here, I'll give you a rundown of what stood out to me most. 1) The line outside snaked around and around, but they sweetened the experience with hot chai tea and sherry. Once you get inside, you *may* think your wait is over but instead, you're transported downstairs to the bar area. We had enough time to get a drink and apps there. Our total wait time was about an hour but these little extras made it fly by. 2) We ordered okra fries and lamb samosas at the bar, then Dishoom's signature dish (and vegetarian) house black daal, curry-infused chicken ruby, and garlic naan at our table. There's nothing I would not recommend. 3) I love how Indian restaurants offer an array of non-alcoholic drinks that are delicious like laasis, and Dishoom takes that one step further with teas, coffees, and sodas. That being said, I still went with some cocktails including the super refreshing Bollybellini and classic Bombay Pimm's. 4) I truly enjoyed reading the menu and learned that the restaurant donates a free lunch to schools in India for every meal you eat at Dishoom. 5) I would've come back here time and time again (including for breakfast!) if I had more time in London. There are heaps of other dishes I need to try. So there ya have it. Believe the hype. Love the hype. Taste the hype.",

    "text": "Oh, Dishoom. You were wonderful. In dire need of Indian food on a cold London evening, we found Dishoom through raving reviews online and once we got there its popularity was clear: the wait was permanently an hour and 30 minutes- there was even a line to wait for the 1h30m line! \u00a0We wanted to understand the hype and ended up waiting about an hour (I think they try to throw people off with that long time) and all the while they serve hot spiced chai- delicious.Once we were in, I asked what the waiter's favorite dish was, chicken ruby, and tried that. We paired it alongside their lamb biryani and a cucumber salad veggie dish. The food was DELICIOUS. Definitely try the chicken ruby! So so good, we even came back and tried the suggestion of another waiter, malak paneer (just.omg.incredible!), the chicken biryani and garlic naan. Everything was well worth the wait! Some small downsides: the cider I tried here definitely is an acquired taste. I love ciders, and if you do too maybe give it a go, but it seemed to be watered down and a little spiced? Not my favorite. Otherwise, the dishes themselves can be on the medium/small side, and the mains don't come with any rice, bread, or veggie sides. So if you're ordering chicken tikka, that doesn't come with a side of rice, or a piece of garlic naan, or a small veggie dish. I'd keep that in mind, as the price can stack up quickly when you add all of those combinations up.Either way, Dishoom was delicious \u00a0and worth the hype! The atmosphere was an interesting old school London/Indian 60s and 70s vibe? Great experience!",

Chicken tikka, prawn moilee, and house black daal were all cooked to perfection.Alin was our server who took the time to explain the dishes and encouraged us to share- he was very knowledgeable on all the dishes and kindly asked if there were any dietary restrictions within our party.No room for dessert but will definitely return again....and again! I had touched on reservations prior, make sure you book them. On our way out, there was a line of patrons half down the street- that should show you how great Dishoom really is!",

While it's a small chain - the food is definitely is not chain like. They told us that the wait will be an hour and 15min. We almost decided to leave but we were only in London for a days and a half so we waited it out in the bar. If you have to wait get the Dal Moth - this little snack is so very tasty. The atmosphere is very lively, and the staff super friendly. They even have a small kids meal menu. Turns out the wait was only 40min but even at 1hr and 15min it would still be worth the wait. The best dish we had was the Black Dal - it's their signature dish. It's cooked for 24hours and it's basically Dal with a light smoky taste. Very yummy :)In all we had some samosas, four different curries and the chicken berry biryani - got a side or rice and some rita. That was plenty for a party of four. If you have to have great Indian food, I would highly recommend Dishoom as a place to go. Pick the one on Kingly Street just a short 15min walk from Piccadilly Square. The neighborhood for this restaurant is very fun.",

    "text": "Quick summary: Delicious Indian cuisine in a lively upscale locationI made reservations to eat here long before I came to town because I was way too excited about trying the food that local and non-local Yelpers rave about. The ability to make reservations online way in advance is an automatic plus-one rating from me. First thing I noticed was that there was a huge line forming outside in the rain. Once I mentioned the reservation, we were led to our table on the ground floor immediately. The kitchen is on this level, so you can see the craziness from your seat. There is a downstairs portion of this restaurant, which I was grateful to not be seated in because there are no windows and I get claustrophobic. However, when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated, with little alcoves for your party and different artwork. It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating. Here are the dishes I tried with photos attached: Keema Pau- spiced lamb appetizer to get you goingMasala Prawns- Large, grilled, and seasonedRoomali Roti- A paper thin bread Chicken Ruby- Luxurious chicken curryGarlic Naan- Personal favorite for any Indian mealThe food here is well spiced, fresh, and cooked to perfection. It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me. The service was impeccable as well. This is a perfect restaurant for date night, special occasions, and to treat yourself. Their large drink menu also makes this an option for you to make a night of it with coworkers or friends.",

Unfortunately, the only time that I could visit was during the morning, so we opted to try the food prior to our trip to Buckingham Palace. Luckily, we got there before the brunch crowd, so we were able to be seated right away. The menu didn't have a ton of choices, but I decided on the Big Bombay breakfast, which included eggs, beans, sausage, bacon and some rolls. It was a relatively simple breakfast (and a lot of food), but everything was nicely cooked and flavorful. Paired with some orange juice, this was a good start to the day exploring London. I would definitely want to return, next time I am in London, to try dinner.",

The Indian restaurants in Florida mainly serve lunch and dinner only, so an Indian restaurant open for breakfast definitely piqued my interest. There's multiple Dishoom locations throughout the city. For breakfast, we made a reservation online at their Covent Garden location. When we arrived around 8:30AM, it was pretty empty! I don't think the reservation was even necessary at that point. But around 9:30 -10:00 AM, when we were leaving tables were filling up quickly. For appetizer, we ordered the bacon & egg naan roll. Hot & fresh baked naan with chili tomato and fresh herb sauce. I ordered the Kejriwal as my main meal, which is two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. The fiance ordered The Big Bombay, the sausage and baked beans English-style breakfast with an Indian twist. Every plate was bursting with bright colors and looked absolutely delectable. An explosion of flavors in each bite. Go early to avoid the lines. Best and most unique breakfast you'll have in a while! We loved it so much that we visited another location by the train station for late dinner.",

The vegetarian curry was my personal favorite. The reviews do not lie, Dishoom is where it is at. Tip: make reservations in advance or you will have to wait it out.",

Small plates: We had the okra fries, lamb samosas, and keema pau- all SO amazing. The keema pau is Iranian and was soooo delicious- the lamb is flavorful and a little oily, which makes it go perfectly with the homemade bun that goes with it (which is toasted to perfection!). Mains: between the two days we tried the chicken ruby (twice!!) which is basically their version of butter chicken. It is honestly the best butter chicken I've ever had. We also had the chicken berry biryani which was delicious- the berries gave it a nice and different flavor. We also had the house black daal which was delicious, and I'm a huge daal lover. My bf also had the dishoom chicken tikka roll was very tasty also. And of course we had garlic naan with it all!Drinks: my bf tried the dishoom pale ale and thought it was really good! I also had the bollybellini which was very tasty, but definitely a sweet cocktail. I also had the baileys chai which was so delicious, perfect amounts of both and an amazing cream on top. Dessert: we had the dishoom chocolate pudding- so good!! It's more of a molten chocolate flourless cake, less like a traditional American pudding. It comes with a spicy chili ice cream which is so unique. Overall very delicious",

We went on a Sunday night and were in line for around 30 mins before they invited us in the bar area, followed by a proper table in the dining area in around 20 mins (total 50 mins)! We did not mind the wait. At the bar, we ordered Kala Khatta (non alcoholic drink, \u00a0mixed with \u00a0flavorful \u00a0spices, traditional to indian palette) and dishoom india pale. Both were great and we could not wait for the main course!For main course, we ordered lamb samosas, pau bhaji, chicken ruby, garlic naan and roomali roti. Lamb samosas were 5/5 and Pau Bhaji may be a 4/5 (i have had better). They served samosas with three different chutneys, which was amazing! Chicken ruby was tender, juicy, rich in flavors, and lip smacking good! I literally could have wiped the plate clean! So good.We ended the dinner with house tea, which was AMAZING!!Can't wait to come back.",

We ordered several items to share among our group of 4. Chicken tikka, Mahi tikka, Chicken Ruby, gunpowder potatoes, lamb samosas and 2 orders of naan bread. Our favorite dishes were the samosas, chicken ruby and potatoes. The chicken tikka had some grissle pieces so the quality of meat wasn't up to par and the mahi was under seasoned for my taste (and it's really tilapia). But the service was amazing and the side sauces were a nice addition to any bite. I loved the red spicy sauce on everything! I highly recommend this restaurant and the chicken ruby with a starter and some naan.",

It was the longest line we'd ever seen, but it sure stirred some interest and we made a reservation for that weekend! From what we've heard from friends, it's not easy to get a reservation a few days away so we were pretty stoked. I think they take reservations until 5:30 so if you walk in before, there should be some open tables.I'm giving 4/5 because I found the portions small, but it is advertised as \"small plates\"/tapa style so it's an opportunity to try a bit of everything. We ordered the murgh malai, lamb kabab, and some garlic naan. Everything was really delicious!",

Dishoom creates a fresh, modern take on classic Bombay cuisine in a visually stunning ambiance. Gilded light fixtures, beautiful antique photos, dark wood details, and intricately tiled floors provide a glamorous fine dining vibe. The interior is enormous, with two floors of seating. This would be a good place to come with a large group. Service was elusive and difficult to summon, but the place is super hectic so we did not really mind. To drink I tried the Rose Lassi, which was delicious. Nice subtle floral flavors, and the perfect amount of sweetness. We shared the Gunpowder Potatoes and Bowl of Greens, both of which were simple, flavorful plant based sides that would compliment any entree. My main was the Jackfruit Biryani, which was excellent. The jackfruit was not shredded as I expected, but served as larger chunks in a bowl of rice. Richly spiced and deeply savory, the tender meat substitute provided a perfect contrast to the aromatic basmati rice. The trio of condiment sauces served on the side further enhanced the complex flavors-do not skip on adding these to your food. My boyfriend does not like Indian food (at all), and enjoyed his wrap. Lunch for two came to just around \u00a345-a bargain considering the quality of ingredients and generous portions. I would not hesitate to recommend Dishoom.",

The ambience was great, the service was great and definitely worth the 1hr 10 min wait. They provided chi tea while you waited and the time actually flew by. Overall great experience if you go make sure to interact with Perney he was at the door as one of the host. Definitely don't get turned away by the line it is worth it!!!",

They have two floors of dining areas and patrons can wait at one of two bars if they are allowed to navigate the queue outside.The first highlight of this dining experience were the cocktails. Unique, ethnic inspired cocktails are a great addition to delicious Indian food. The Viceroy Old Fashion (\u00a39.50) and the East Indian Gimlet (\u00a38) were the best drinks. In terms of the food, I would highly recommend house specials. The Pau Bhaji (\u00a34.50) and the Daal (\u00a36.20) were packed with flavor and were perfect for dipping breads. We split a lot of small dishes and this seemed to be a good method of enjoying lots of different dishes. It seemed like most tables were employing this tasting method.Overall, this place is great. I have no complaints. I would recommend getting here early as the line was very long when we were ending our dining experience.",

Our service was friendly and very attentive, and they kept the house chai flowing which was fantastic! We got the Kejriwal and the Keema Per Eedu. Both were quite tasty, especially the Keema (which had a stronger flavor). I was sad to not have enough stomach space to try out some of the naans. Most of all, I loved the decor - from all of the photographs, to even the decor in the restrooms, to the giant clock going backwards (\"it's on Bombay time\" - our server) it really has a lovely atmosphere that feels special and unique.",

Not only is food from out of this world, the service is incredible. I had this establishment on my list of places to visit, but could never circumvent the never ending line in front of the door, sometimes with people waiting in the rain around the corner, just for a chance to dine at Dishroom. This time, I stumbled upon it while walking through Covent Garden and - there was no line. No line means no-brainer. I had to get in. Still a 30 min wait, which was made quite pleasurable with their underground bar. 15 mins in and my table was ready. Oh boy...what a feast, and what a party in my mind and soul. Lamb samosas and to start are a great way to ease you into what's coming. Their roasted veggie spread on a pretzel bun - are simply incredible. That might be the very best appetizer I have ever had. Amazing. Of course, I didn't stop there, Lamb kabob, black daal, basmati rice, garlic naan, and dish room chicken tikka blew me away. The perfect blend of tastes unlike any other i've experienced. Staff - best service I've seen in London. Tickles my friendly, sunny American expectations that everyone should smile all the time and make you feel welcome and valued.Hats down to Dishroom.",

I think it says volumes about a place when people are prepared to queue outside a place for up to an hour in the middle of winter.The waiter was so friendly and took time to discuss the whole menu. In the end we pretty much let him choose. My favourites were the lamb chops spiced to perfection and served sprinkled in pomegranate seeds, and the okra fries. The food was quite spicy but with some yoghurt dip my mouth was cooled.I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a delicious dinner. And who doesn't want that!",

I think we pretty much ordered the whole menu since it was like a tapas style where the dishes come out pretty small but packed with so much flavor. I think I may have just about every veggie dish on the menu plus the calamari and they did not disappoint. The mango lassi was also very good.

For a table of two, they told us the wait was going to be an hour but we were starving so we ended up eating elsewhere. Definitely make reservations people! We then decided to come here for breakfast Tuesday morning before we left for the airport and boy was that such a great idea!! No lines, service was quick, waitresses were very sweet and accommodating. The interior was very warm and welcoming and the pictures on the wall gave off a Bollywood feel. Our cups of House Chai was never empty. Yes - they have bottomless chai and it was the best chai I've ever tasted. Onto the food..- Bacon Naan Roll 5.20\u00a3 : my goodness, the naan was so good, the bacon was smokey and delicious, and I was just addicted to their chili tomato jam they put in the roll. Can I bring a jar of it home? - Big Bombay (akuri, char-striped smoked streaky bacon from The Ginger Pig, peppery Shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled field mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns) 11.50\u00a3: it was essentially a little bit of everything from the cooked breakfast menu. Everything on the plate was so delectable. We finished the whole plate and didn't even leave a single drop of sauce on the plate. Fantastic prices, bottomless chai, outstanding service. I wish I had come here sooner! If I am back in London, I will definitely be stopping by here again. \u00a0My mouth is watering just writing about this review. Highly recommended!!",

    "text": "\"London's first Bombay cafe, Dishoom brings a slice of cool Bombay to Covent Garden\" says the website and so it does. We were lucky enough to be invite to a pre-opening dry-run but you can sample their delights from Thursday - with the added bonus of 50% off during their first week. \u00a0No reservations are required so get there early to avoid disappointment!!!! I can categorically say that this place will be full to bursting from the off... Dishoom advertises itself as a street cafe, which are, having done my wiki research, apparently (and sadly if this restaurant is anything to go by) a dying breed. The menu is simple and varied enough without being overloaded with choice. The dishes that come are small, but don't be deceived, we only ordered a small dish and main each and were stuffed and barely touched dessert! There is an open kitchen, try and nab one of the popular booths in the bright and airy room upstairs, serving dishes such as chilli cheese toast and fish tikka, and main dishes including salads, roomali roti wraps and grilled kebabs.We were spoilt for choice with hot cumin laden lamb chops, a juicy mince meat keema pau spread on buttery bap, delicate flaky fish fingers which are perfect with the fragrant mint sauce, a hot! hot! byriani, and my favourite (and their signature dish) the melt in the mouth chicken tikka.. just beautiful. We were absolutely gutted when they accidentally sent us some prawns and then immediately took them about. The looked big and fat and juicy and the smell of coriander and lime.. Mmmmmmm... oh well.. next time!!! Service was a bit haphazard, as you'd expect on a dry-run with frazzled nerves in the run up to an overdue opening. But it was smiley and our waitress and greeter were lovely and chatty and amazing knowledgeable and helpful. The only supremely petty criticism I would have, and this is purely my own taste I should pint out, is that I wasn't a fan of the black tarka daal; which tasted more like Heinz mulligatawny, whereas I like my daal almost a warming slushy oniony, garlicky soup. And the chocolate fondant didn't sit so well with the rest of the menu, we all had ideas about how to make it more authentic; chilli said one, NO, cardamom said I. The waiter said that they were thinking of making it a chocolate and pistachio brownie.. mmm, that will go perfectly with the cinnamon (and nutmeg??) ice-cream served alongside, which was just divine and I'm not especially a fan of ice-cream - it's not a real dessert to me, more of a fob-off. The gola ices were also lovely, the mango and ginger a perfect palate cleanser. Unfortunately we didn't try the chai or the cocktails, we were just too full of food and drink to even contemplate it, I'm leaving that for a revisit. They won't be waiting too long... like I said there's 50% off the first week AND they open for breakfast. oh woe is my wallet!",

This cute caf\u00e9/brasserie serves up fabulous food. But the Pau Bhaji, with it's creamy veggie mash and buttered fluffy bread was the star of the evening. Some seriously classy curry!For it's location I was suprised at just how authentic the cuisine was; I mean, plonked in the middle of Leicester Square area you'd expect it to be another Punjab. You'd be mistaken. This is a slice of Whitechapel, snuggled into a classy surrounding, with leather booths, a really helpful hostess and brass finishing. Totally a Thumbs Up from me.",

The service here was great, but I also came here on a weekday for lunch when it wasn't too busy. \u00a0I loved the cutesy clean diner decor with Bollywood posters everywhere.P.S. \u00a0I apologize for all of the American-centric comments written above.",

We decided to do it, but we were actually seated in about 10 minutes. The waiter was very informative about all the dishes and offered us a non dairy menu since I'm slightly lactose intolerant (meaning I can have some dairy but not a ton of cream or yugert in the dish). We decided on the following dishes:KEEMA PAU - spicy minced lamb Really flavorful and not too spicy.DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA - grilled chicken with their family recipe no yugert. It was so good and flavorful. The chicken was slightly chared on the outside and juicy on the inside. MASALA PRAWNS - delightfully succulent and tasty.Garlic naan - perfectly soft and slightly crispyA bowl of green - fresh green veggies All the dishes were great and the 3 dipping sauces have distinct flavors and you must try all of them to see if you like sweet, spicy or minty spicy. I also had a Bombay colada (no rum), it was such a delicious drink I could have 3 more.We really like this place. The only not so great \u00a0thing about it was the hostess kept telling everyone to go wait outside. It was a very windy day, luckily we found a spot to wait near the entrance to shelter us from the wind.But this will not keep us from coming back.",

Even so, we decided to give Dishoom a shot since literally everyone ever told us to come and give it a try, so we arrived later in the evening, falling asleep because we were so tired. And boy are we glad we came.The menu is extensive - lots of somewhat smaller sharables for order. We got a veggie mash, potatoes, garlic naan, chicken, and quite a few other items for just the two of us, leaving quite a few leftovers for later on. Make no mistake however - leftovers were because we were completely stuffed, not because the food was bad.I can't speak for authenticity, but the flavoring was delicious and unlike anything I had had before. Though distinctly Indian, the restaurant improved on the flavoring and had a great garlic naan that lasted in taste beyond its warmth. The okra was also exceptional, and the worst dish may have been the lamb or the potatoes, which really says something - they were good too. The environment is also worth talking about. Its a bit like a transportation back in time, an underground bar and a nice sense of decor tying the place together.Come here, whether or not you like Indian food. You just may be pleasantly surprised.",

    "text": "London is known for having the best Indian food after the country India itself. When I visited London, I was with an Indian food fanatic who insisted on eating it as often as possible. After hearing about Dishoom and the wonderful reputation it had, we knew we had to visit.Since Dishoom is so popular, it's well known that you're going to encounter a long line when you arrive. We had read reviews of people waiting up to 2 hours. My sister and I came prepared for the long haul. We weren't going to leave, no matter what. Luckily for us, we waited outside for about 45min (thankfully since it was pretty cold outside). We thought we had finally made it in, but then we were directed to a bar on the bottom floor to wait longer at a bar. I'm guessing Dishoom does this to get you out of the cold, and get some drinks in your system while you wait. We were called to our table about 15 minutes later.My first impression of Dishoom was how busy it was. The restaurant is loud and filled with voices of people having a good time. Every seat was taken and the restaurant worked like a machine getting people in, feed, and out again. I thought the large restaurant with so many people was overwhelming. While it was a bit off putting, I took it as a good sign that this place is so popular and liked by people, that it's very packed.To start the meal, we got the vegetable samosas, and the keema pau. Both were the highlight of the meal for me. The vegetable samosas were tasty, and the keema pau was just as good. My main dish is where I think Dishoom failed. I got the Dishoom Chicken Teeka Roll and it was pretty bad. The roll was very dry, there was hardly any taste to it. I have to say, after hearing such great reviews about Dishoom, I was really disappointed. I'm not one to believe in the \"you got the wrong dish\" mentality. I think every dish should be good at a restaurant, not just a specific one. My sister got the mattar paneer and really liked it. I wanted to like Dishoom because of the great reviews, but it just wasn't as spectacular as people say. The service was great, the atmosphere was cool (but overwhelming), and my main dish was lackluster. Would I visit Dishoom again? Probably. I would see if I could pick a better dish and enjoy it more (even though this goes against my usual judgement).",

The cheese naan was also tasty, but was super filling and just made it seem like a grilled sandwich pancake. We probably should've ordered the classic instead.* Chole ChawalThis was really nice. It came with diced red onion and a really nice sauce. Big fan of this one.* Prawn and Pomelo SaladFresh veggies and prawn, but while not overcooked really, parts of the prawns were a bit charcoaled. The salad was good except that there was a bit too much dressing on it.* Paneer TikkaNice and firm. Fresh veggies used too without overcooking.* Cinnamon Ice CreamGreat stuff! Had a great flavour and it was creamy but not too much, so it was still nice and light.The only big downside for us was how noisy it was.

    "text": "Dishoom is the sound a Bollywood film hero makes when he lands a good punch. How cool is that? The restaurant (although they call themselves a Bombay caf\u00e9) is pretty cool as well. Consisting of two floors, it's routinely packed to the afters on Friday and Saturday nights. Even for a \u00a0table for 3 at 6pm, the wait was 30mins so if going make sure to make a reservation or leave a margin for waiting. A quick pre-theatre meal this is not.I've been wanting to go for ages since one of my Indian friends had raved about the dal and biriyani. So I grabbed him and another of my brown brethren and the three of us headed off to Dishoom for dinner.As noted above, we had a wait so off to the downstairs bar we went. Dishoom doesn't have an extensive cocktail list (although I imagine any of the standard drinks would be provided upon request if you so asked) but it does have several classics rejuvenated with a Desi twist. I opted for the Chaijito which as the name suggests is a Chai infused mojito. I was a bit doubtful of a lime and chai tea flavour mix but I have to say it was spectacular. The clean crisp flavours of the lime just barely sweetened with sugar refreshed the palatte while the chai added a playful note without any of the cloudy and cloying after taste you get in a chai tea latte. My friends' Bollywood Bellini and some form of punch were also good but I would stick with my choice as being the best.After about 20-25 minutes we were seated in a cosy table upstairs. Naturally, we ordered the house dal (a black lentil dal rather than the traditional red or orange) and a lamb biriyani with masala prawns for a starter. The prawns were good in their own right however could have used more masala to truly be masala prawn. The dal was delicious with a sharp bite and a deeper burn from the chillies used. The biriyani was tasty but nothing on what my mom makes (and since she made it a few days ago it had to contend with my recent taste memory). The garlic naan was sorely disappointed and looked more like a garlic topped Ryvita cracker than any real attempt at a naan. I hope ours was just an anomaly as a good naan is an essential pillar of a good Indian restaurant.Overall, it's a bit expensive but a fun and tasty experience. Keep in mind this is more grilled type of Indian cooking rather than an abundance of curries (going North rather than South) but overall a good time. Definitely worked a treat as a pre-night out classy spot!I really want to go back for breakfast and get a bacon naan roll!",

I would go back just for that again. Only tip is to book in advance - I booked about a month ahead and it was definitely worth it. We all left with only good things to say",

The hostess, waiters, and staff are truly interested and dedicated to their customers and recognize them for repeated service.Ambiance and decor - provides the perfect backdrop that compliments the food and serviceMediocre:Naan - although traditional and well executed, a little too dense for my tasteLong lines - unless dining early for breakfast, or before 5 PM for dinner, there is a long line (20 minutes or longer) - However, they serve hot chai while waiting that compensates for the inconveniencePineapple crumble - would have preferred more pineapple and less crumble - just my preference - however, other restaurants in London (non Indian) have also served crumble with these proportions of fruit/crumble. This may reflect a regional food preparation rather than a execution flaw.For any Indian food afficiando, eating at Dishoom is a must!",

    "text": "There's something very egalitarian about chain restaurants. They simply don't care who you are and aren't at all bothered about trying to impress you specifically. No bookings, you turn up, wait your turn, and get the same service as everyone else. In his excellent review in the Guardian, Jay Rayner recounts how he had to stand outside in the queue with the rest of the rabble too, slightly discombobulating I've no doubt, for a man used to a certain level of recognition. After a late afternoon meeting over wine (the best sort of meeting) me and my two guests thought about staying in the rarified atmosphere of the Ivy Club but in the interests of investigative research joined Mr Rayner and other food luminaries by queuing at Dishoom. Dishoom has been referred to (mainly by the PR team) as a Bombay style cafe. An egalitarian, open all hours canteen serving taxi drivers, students, writers and lawyers (according to their puff anyway)...None of those stereotypes were notably present on the night, predominantly, our fellow diners were more the middle class braying London types you traditionally find clogging up the greener parts of zone 2.There's got to be a book written for this. 'Food Branding 2.0 - lessons for the post Pizza Express generation'. Like the equally insipid Jamie's Italian next door, and 'gourmet, authentic Mexican fine dining experience' (more PR bullshit) Cantina Laredo next door to that, the team behind Dishoom seem to have swallowed the whole volume, hook, (press) line and sinker. It's somewhat sinister having all three of them next to each other. It's the kind of line-up better suited to touting for passing trade outside a Croydon multiplex rather than prime real estate in the centre of London. The food is casual, safe and generic Indian (at risk of insulting a large country). It doesn't seem to come from anywhere specific, and certainly didn't bear any relation to what (admittedly little) I know of the hot, spicy street food of the region. For a coastal city, you'd expect fish to feature heavily, the best they could do was a 'Dill Salmon (that well known Indian fish) Tikka'. Our starters included Bombay Sausages, a student dinner party staple of the future fusing chipolatas, onion and curry paste, Chilli Cheese (on) Toast, pleasant but utterly underwhelming, and a dish called Keema Pau, minced lamb in a ragu style sauce served alongside a muffin. \u00a0These came with fridge fresh pickle pots and a highlight, perfectly chilled Meantime Union beer. Our main courses were similarly pedestrian. The Chicken Biryani was nicely presented in a clay pot with a pastry seal but arrived dry, beautifully but subtly fragranced and lacking in a core ingredient. \"Do they serve the chicken on the side?\" questioned the Drama Queen, apparently not, it was just hiding (very well) in the rice. The taste was as subtle and shy as a thirteen year old at a school disco, it felt like nothing more than an accompaniment. The Spicy Lamb Chops came with some semblance of taste and some of the vim and zing you'd expect from a decent kitchen. Beautifully cooked, tender and juicy, they were the one high point for me. The final plate, a Lamb Boti Kebab was dry again and chewier than expected. \u00a0There's a niche in the market for a chain Indian, and Dishoom gives a good argument for filling it. For anyone who's ventured within a mile of Tayyabs or Lahore in the East End, or been to some of the great curry houses of Birmingham, Southall or Bradford you're going to be left wanting. That being said, if you're stuck in theatreland with kids or random relatives who \"don't usually like that spicy foreign stuff\", you could do worse. And if that isn't damning with faint praise, I don't know what is.",

After putting in our order, we sat and chatted while enjoying the atmosphere and lovely aroma (which indeed made me even more hungry!). I was slightly sceptical if it would taste as good as it smelled, but my oh my, I need not to worry! We had a lamb dish, daal, calamari and roti - all of which were fantastic! I would go back for the calamari alone. Overall - lovely atmosphere, delicious food, good service and decent prices. I will definitely be back and may possibly even queue for a short while.",

Ate here on 2 occasions, the first time was lunch got the Rumali roti and Chicken tikka. Hubby got the Chicken Berry Biryani...I can't wait to go to Bombay and try the berry pulav at Britannia so I can compare! Second time round went with a couple of friends we ordered up a storm. Pau Bhaji, Spicy roasted potatoes,Lamb Chops, Sausages and Lamb Biryani. Dessert was excellent, we got the Gola ice( which was forbidden to us as kids growing up in India) It was pretty good as was the berry crumble ( not very Indian I know...but so good). I got a Limca this time!! Definitely a good spot to eat some good Indian food, a little expensive but oh so worth it! Looking forward to going back this September with my sisters!",

We didn't end up having it that night since I soon realized how popular of a place Dishoom is but upon entering and smelling the wonderful aromas of food I decided that we absolutely HAD to come back to try this place before we left for home!We were able to get a quick seat coming to this location for lunch around 11 and we ordered basically everything that was popular on the menu and that our waiter suggested! We got the chicken ruby, pau bhaji (10/10) would recommend, garlic naan, house black daal, and lamb shanks (not a lamb fan usually, but would also def recommend. the pomegranate seeds are a unique touch). for the three of us, we honestly planned to order so much more food since it is served tapas style but our waiter warned us (so sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful!) that it would be a lot and he was definitely right, we were SO full!The decor of this place was adorable and everything is so nicely presented. it's also priced really well for the food you get!

They have a dedicated gluten free menu and the staff is very well informed on the allergies. The cocktails were really good, if you can't find something on the menu, the barkeeper will make you something based on your taste. The food was absolutely amazing. It was served tapas style so you don't have to commit to one meal and even though it was super busy our food came in a very timely manner. Highly recommend this to satisfy any cravings for Indian food!",

I am not a believer in standing in line for good food, especially in London, when there is so many good ones around every corner...but I have stood in line numerous times for this spot. Why? Because if you stand in line, at times they will bring you the most amazing chai to make it worth your while. Now in any other Indian restaurant, you are going to see your usual samosas, pakoras, naan, Tikka masala, etc...sure you will see those here, too, but this restaurant you will offer you things not offered elsewhere. The chili cheese toast for one is delicious...simple, with cheese and chives...I don't know why it is absolutely mind-blowing, but it is. Then, you get to the nitty gritty with the okra that is so crispy and always feels fresh. The roomali roti lives up to it's name by being handkerchief thin that you can inhale five before you realize.Now don't forget to go downstairs to the bar and have the bartender whip you up some unique drinks or the very reliably yummy mango lassi. The wait staff could not be nicer. Rain or shine, and I hate the rain, I am willing to wait to eat at this restaurant...now that's saying something!",

    "text": "Mmm, this place truly deserves all the hype that it gets! Hands down the best restaurant I went to in London.Two friends and I ordered the garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka masala, black house dal, chicken ruby, lamb and vegetable samosas, a bowl of greens, and a few sides of basmati rice. I also got the Bombay colada - one of the most unique and tasty drinks I've ever had. A little spicy and super refreshing with a good kick. All the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable; our waitress was chatty and funny and recommended several of the above dishes to us.Moving on to the main dishes - so impressed! Out of all the entrees, I would recommend the dal the most - very meaty and flavorful. The chicken dishes were incredibly tangy and spicy (ask them to tone down the spice if you're not into that). The garlic naan was warm and buttery and absolutely delicious! As was the roti - it absorbed the flavor of the previous dishes well and came with three very tasty sauces. Great samosas (I liked the vegetable more than the lamb) and uniquely crunchy / salty / flavorful greens. Overall everything was very very good and prices were reasonable, especially for London. It's a fun place to eat with a lot of people since dishes are pretty small - grab some friends and try out a bunch of things! Oh, and make a reservation in advance - it gets super busy. Breakfast and lunch hours are less crowded so that may be a better option!",

If you go for lunch, you get \"a delectable, cacophonous lunch thing.\" And if you go for dinner, you get \"a stand in line for an hour in drizzle thing\".For Dishoom is well past discovered and isn't likely to return to ambiguity in any forseeable future.So, you're gonna have to deal with \"the thing\". It is worth it?Absolutely.I've been here over a dozen times and have never been disappointed. From the Gunpowder Potatoes with lime zest, to Okra Fries, to any of the curries...Dishoom is amaze-balls. The environs are well-appointed. Kind of a \"dark wood and eclectic trappings from the East India Company thing\". The waitstaff is prompt, high professional, and handles the chaos with aplomb. The prices are a tad on the high-side for curry, but reasonable. The beer - several of which are made expressly for Dishoom - is YUM.So the only thing is \"the thing\". You're gonna have to deal with the wait, and crowds, and noise.Or are you? In the years I've been going to Dishoom it's added three more locations. I haven't been to all of them, but I can tell you ones I have been to are way less crowded than St. Martin's Lane.So go have a night in any of the others, and leave the chaos for those not in the know. You'll have a spectacular thing.",

    "text": "Amazing Indian food!! Much better than anything I've had in New York or Boston. Firstly, Dishoom is a \"new bombay style\" Indian restaurant. I don't know exactly what this means but it is hip and trendy inside, not a mom and pop Indian place. However, despite this, the food tastes authentic and the clientele was about 50% Indian. We went here on a Friday night and it was so packed. First, we waited outside for about an hour. However, they kept bringing us brandy and hot chai tea so we didn't mind so much since we were having a great time drinking. Then, we were escorted to the bar area to wait where we ordered drinks and could have ordered appetizers if we wanted. And lastly, we were escorted to our table. Waited about 1 hr 45 mins in total. However, this was probably the most enjoyable long wait I have ever had for a table. Dishoom is organized and everything is electronic. Everyone knew my name and exactly how long I had waited for a table. It was quite a pleasant experience. I can't remember the names of the drinks we had but they were delicious. I also especially loved the hot spiced chai tea we had when we waited. Would definitely recommend ordering the chai tea. To eat, we had the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black daal. I don't even like dark meat chicken but I loved the chicken ruby! It is very similar to chicken tikka masala but it has a unique flavor and I think is event better. The black daal was incredible and so buttery and filled with flavor. The food came out extremely quickly so even though we waited a long time for the table, we were eating within 10 minutes of sitting down. For dessert, we had some type of mango granola pudding that was also incredible. Definitely, definitely visit here. It is a unique experience you can't get anywhere else!",

However i would like to recommend this restaurant more for lunch and snack like cuisine.I had the Samosa Chaat and Vada Pau both were perfect and i would have these again.For main course I had Chicken Biryani and i have to say thats where my disappointment came from as it was not as rich as i had wanted it to be.Nevertheless its off my list of places to check out and i would not mind visitng again.",

    "text": "Look here's the thing. Normally Indian food is not my Jam under any circumstances. And yet here I am giving an Indian restaurant 5 stars so it's not just a good Indian restaurant it's an amazing one, one that can make me forget what my overtly racist taste buds want me to eat.I went ham with the ordering so here's what we got:Vegetable Somosas- started off with a classic and it was a great start. Very standard no doubt but seasoned very well and fried perfectly. No complaints but also no unique twist on it.Pau Bhaji- now things are getting interesting- \"a bowl of mashed vegetables\" is the description; what an understatement. Basically a vegetable tomato paste that was flat out delicious and the perfect dip for bread.Okra Fries- and now we hit the jackpot. Fried okra that I swear was seasoned so much you would think it would be way too much but it worked perfectly. A punch of flavor in your mouth for sure, but an amazing one.Awadhi Lamb- extremely tender and flavorful. Sauced like crazy but I wanted much more.Garlic Naan- I mean it's Naan and bread is always gonna be delicious.PSA- Ordered a second helping of Okra fries-they were that good.It's on the lists of best restaurants in London and for good reason. The lines can be brutal but either show up away from peak hours or suck it up because those okra fries are worth every second waiting in that cold raining nightmare of a city :D",

They were easily able to accommodate my gluten free and dairy free medical dietary restrictions (even had a menu for both). \u00a0The prawn moilee was by far the best dish we had. It was truly amazing! The chicken tikka was a distant second for me and the sheekh kabab was skippable. My spouse shared many other dishes with the others in our party and had the same sentiments at the end of the meal. The ingredients seemed fresh and of high quality, but especially for the price-point, we were sadly overall underwhelmed by the food. Not the value we were hoping for. Glad to have checked it off the list and grateful they were so accommodating to my dietary restrictions. Would go back for the prawn moilee alone though! :)",

Unanimously voted worth waiting outside in line for an hour in the cold (sweetened by cups of chai and lemonade on the house - but don't worry, you can reserve tables too). Gimlet was the best I ever had. Bombay colada was fresh and heavenly. Calamari, black daal, and garlic naan were phenomenal. Also had chicken tikka and lamb biryani that were amazing. Our only regret was not ordering a side of basmati rice to spoon the remaining black daal and tikka sauce over. Service was very fast and attentive. Prices extremely reasonable. The decor. Don't even get me started! Modern chic brasserie with awesome vintage Indian film posters and pictures/ads. Cool lighting and fans spinning above head. Feels like a jump back to a modernized, chic, Bombay British colonial place.",

First, get ready for an unnecessary hour wait outside, the food is as good as any other Indian restaurant you will find in London, the wait do not warrant the quality of the food, we try quite a nice array The fried squid - it's oily no crispy The lamb Samoa - dry and tasteless The spicy lamb chops - dry, over cookThe garlic nam - was good The rice - basic steam rice The ruby Ryan - the star of the chef - ummm is ok nothing to brag about - chicken was little tough due to the long simmer Not against going as the staff is really friendly but not worth the wait ... The long line It's a marketing strategic to lore costumers in , by the way after waiting outside you get to wait at the bar as well before you get a table .Happy eating !!!",

    "text": "The food was solid. I had the okra fries, mahi tikka, and bowl of greens. Okra fries - split in half so more crispy edges. The batter was thin and nicely spiced. It went well with sauce trio they serve along with it. Mahi tikka - the fish was tender and flavorful. Squeeze of lime + fresh cilantro + the orange sauce of the trio = combined flavors for a really delicious bite. Bowl of greens - the flavors of chili and lime were absolutely delicious. The veggies were also not overcooked, so the broccoli, snap peas, and spinach all had a nice crunchy texture. Just wish it was a bit less oily. A quick comment to solo business travelers:We are not tourists, it's not a family vacation, so a lot of times we revert to solo dining at the bar. As a giant FYI, they still make you wait along with everyone else, which for me was brutal bc I'm battling a cough and we were standing outside in the cold. Thankfully there was hot tea served. Also, their bar is not conducive to dining - only drinks and finger food. As a result, I am sitting at a table that seems to have been set up as an afterthought in the rear corner of the downstairs dining area. Fine by me, just less ideal that the social, energetic experience of sitting at the bar. Chicken Tikka Masala is UK's national cuisine, so naturally I opted to try the nearest top rated restaurant for this dish. Overall, delicious. Just wasn't too thrilled with the host process.",

    "text": "It wasn't even 5 pm and this place had a line outside already. \u00a0Granted, this resto is smack dab in the middle of tourist mecca in London, so you really can't fault it for brimming with tourists. With all the accolades it has received at Yelp, Zagat and TripAdvisor to name a few, a long wait here is inevitable. We got lucky though 'cause we only waited about 45 minutes to get seated (with only 6 couples of in front of us or so it seemed). \u00a0Reservations for dinner are only taken for groups of 6 diners or more. \u00a0But here's the 411 on the seating process, just in case you think you're close to being seated when you reach the front of the line (you're not): You stand in line outside, and when you get to the front of the line, they may call you in inside and sit on the chair by the hostess podium, or they may just call you in and lead you directly to the bar downstairs to their basement, where they encourage you to get a drink, and where you have to wait some more. We ordered a couple of drinks (a Virgin Bombay Colada for me and a Nimbu Pani for the hubby), and studied the menu while waiting another 20 minutes down there. We were eventually seated just on the other side of the bar area. \u00a0This place is tight, so you will definitely be in on the conversation of the people next to you, whether you like it or not. \u00a0Here are the items we ordered:Naan--a bit disappointing. \u00a0It wasn't piping hot when it reached our table. \u00a0No blisters on it like it usually has and it wasn't elastic in texture. \u00a0More like a flatbread than a traditional naan. We should have sent it back and gotten a hot off the oven one.Dishoom Calamari--nice flavor, tender, but a little greasy. \u00a0A small portion but perfect for two people sharing. Kacchi Lamb Biryani--good dish, nicely spiced, very tender lamb chunks underneath the rice. \u00a0Kacchi Lamb Chops--ordered and enjoyed by the hubby. \u00a0The marinade has penetrated the meat and you get a very flavorful and tender bite. Enough for 1 person.Raita--good accompaniment for all the dishes we had and will cool your palate.We did not have dessert. \u00a0We were just too full from our dinner. \u00a0Service was friendly and good. \u00a0When we were standing in line outside the restaurant, a staff member came by with small glasses of Nimbu Pani (essentially a lemonade). \u00a0It was a warm day, so it was definitely welcome and refreshing. They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they don't close down at all in the afternoon. \u00a0If you can go in the afternoon, the wait times may be better. \u00a0When we were leaving the restaurant, the line was pretty bad. \u00a0There must have been over 15 parties in line. As good as their food is, I wouldn't wait in that line. \u00a0You're better off trying a mom and pop Indian restaurant that probably has as good, if not better food than this restaurant.",

Thus the line was quite out of control. We really wanted some good Indian food before we left London, and so we stood on line. At least they were serving chai, mint tea and shiraz while you waited on line. The chai was quite good. When we finally were seated, the food did not disappoint!

There were very little spices and nothing tasted like the many Indian restaurants I have enjoyed in the past. Of the many dishes we ordered, not one of them was memorable. The portions are tiny, and the prices are pretty ridiculous in my opinion (we paid about 35\u00a3/person and we're all very hungry after). If you are looking for real Indian food, skip Dishoom. Dishoom doesn't have the ambiance, tastes, smells, or service that its prices reflect or of a quality Indian restaurant. Pass on Dishoom, London has excellent Indian food elsewhere for half the price that is far better and more filling. TLDR; expensive, bland dishes, small portions, average service.",

No wait, but we were lucky!Do not miss your chance to eat here. Yum!!!!!!",

The curry sauce tasted like italian tomato sauce with a touch of indian flavor, lacking the depth and richness of true indian dish. I must admit the naan bread and roti were very good otherwise I would've given them 1 star. If you want to experience indian food go where locals eat but this one is geared for tourists who unlikely to come back.",

    "text": "By and large, London is known for having subpar food considering its status as a world class city. But the one culinary area they universally nail it is Indian food. Dishoom is a shining example of this. I've had my fair share of different Indian food styles. From upscale concepts to all-you-can-eat lunch buffets less than \u00a310. Dishoom sort of does both. Elevated Indian fare that you'll pay something like \u00a37 - \u00a39 for. In a city that easily drain your bank account, it's a welcome respite. I had an array of different items from the menu. Many of which are identified in Yelp's review highlights. The black daal is special. The same goes for the the pau bhaji. But the star of the show was the ruby chicken. It belongs in some intersection of chicken tikka masala and a robust tomato stew. With juicy chunks of white meat chicken, it was understandable that everyone within a few tables of mine were ordering it with reckless abandon. Don't miss this if you know what's good for you.Paired with this bounty was one of the most enjoyable Negronis I've had in months. Being that gin has a huge footprint in this city, they know their botanical-based libations.One bugger is that you'll definitely have to wait to eat. Apparently the average wait is about 80 minutes. It's totally understandable that you'd rather just eat at Five Guys instead of standing around, but if you exercise patience you'll be rewarded.",

I literally have no pictures because we are everything before I remembered to take pics. First off they didn't take reservations but leave a pool of tables available for walk ups. While we waited in the queue, the hostess served us piping hot chai or mint tea since it was quite nippy out. Once you make it to the door, they take you down to the bar area so you can continue to wait for your table while having tasty drinks and snacks. The wait wasn't long; just long enough for one proper cocktail. Once at the table, we ordered straight away since we studied the menu while waiting in the queue. Appetizers included spicy corn like chips, veggie samosas and array of naan with dipping sauces. Gone in twenty secs. Main courses where chicken tikka with rice, lamb chops, and a grilled shrimp dish. Accompanied with a bowl of basmati rice, steamed veggies, and of course more naan. No one spoke. All we could do was makeSounds of delight as we devoured each dish. No one crumb was left. The spices were so flavorful and fresh. The heat factor was definitely present in very dish, but that is why they recommend the yoghurt condiment on the side. It was a swirl wind of flavors; some familiar, but some very foreign and pleasant. \u00a0Dishoom satisfies our Indian hankering ten fold!",

    "text": "My husband and I were in London for a long-weekend. I don't pretend to be an expert on Indian food at all, but I know good food, and this is it. We even went twice, when we're normally all about exploring new places, especially on vacation. This location always has a crazy line, even earlier in the evening, but they are so kind, and give free amazingly good chai tea and a sweet liquor that I didn't like but my husband did (I think it's a sherry variety). I noticed how they also seem to overestimate how long the line will take, so you are happy to be seated earlier (so they say 1 hour, it's really 45 minutes). To start, the food comes with 3 sauces. One is supposed to be more mild and is green and sweet. I loved it and found it very addictive. Another was more spicy, and my husband monopolized it. I don't remember what the third is, since we both were obsessed with our respective choices of sauce.The garlic naan was addictive - warm and perfectly spiced. The masala prawns are also perfectly cooked and spiced.I'm normally not that big of a fan of chicken (I think it's hard to cook well and is either too chewy or too undercooked, and usually not seasoned well). But here, the chicken tikka is perfect - tender, and perfectly seasoned with ginger and a delectable green sauce.I also had the chaijito which was very good. Some flavored mojitos are terrible - overly sweet with no complex flavoring. This drink was not like that - it truly was a good mojito with complex chai spices, perhaps the same ones in their hot chai tea, which is also very good. \u00a0All around great experience. Apparently it's a chain in London - wish it would come to New York!",

Thank you!Upon arrival we were informed of a 1h wait. \u00a0The queue winds around outside however heat lamps are provided but must be in close proximity to benefit. \u00a0The wait ultimately was less than 1h. \u00a0Woot! Under promise, over deliver!Two Dishoom employees, who seemed to be focused on our satisfaction, came by frequently to offer complimentary warm chai tea as we waited. \u00a0This was a delightful and much needed touch on a cold winter/spring night. The service all around was top notch and highly attentive. My main dish - Chicken Ruby- was incredible; so incredible I toyed with the idea of ordering another round (the overstuffed feeling was the only reason I didn't). The dish displayed a delicate balance of spice, tinge of sweetness, and tender, delicious chicken.The prawn dish was ok, the dipping sauce provided with the plate added the extra needed kick. \u00a0I wouldn't order this again if I were to return.The vegetable samosas were forgettable. \u00a0Seemed to taste like nothing but fried oil.Cheese Naan bread- yes! Ten times over yes! \u00a0I used the naan bread to mop up the Chicken Ruby however it's so good on its own too.Pro tip: \u00a0do not check nutrition facts of naan bread whilst eating said naan bread.",

    "text": "I came to Dishoom on a Saturday night with three friends. This place is crazy busy, and they like to keep a line outside, so we joined the queue and waited. I think we were there by 7:15 or so, and got a table a bit before 9. Most of the wait was outside, until we finally made it into the bar. We ordered some cocktails, which were delicious. The pimms is actually too good, and was too easy to drink so we eventually switched to wine.As we were 4, we decided to order a number of dishes to share. My friends got a few meat dishes (lamb chops, one coconut prawn curry, something with chicken) and we also shared dahl and a paneer curry, as well as rice, cheese naan, and some side salad-y cabbage-y dishes. Everything tasted really good, although it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had. The portions were quite generous I thought, and by the end of the meal I was so full I could barely move. The service here was amazing- all of the staff were friendly, we never felt rushed (even though by 10:30 there was still a huge lineup outside), and our food came quite quickly, which was very welcome after having stood outside for ages. The ambiance is also great, especially when with a fun group. I don't know that I'd come here for a date, or just a one-on-one dinner as it's quite busy and loud, but with our group we had a great time.I really enjoyed my evening here, but I don't think I would line up again for over an hour. The entire experience was great, but the food isn't worth a huge wait.",

Once inside, the wait at the bar was wonderful and filled with samosas and red wine. I had the mattar paneer, black dhal, cheese naan, and chocolate chai. Every single thing was absolutely amazing, especially the black dhal. Dhal is served everywhere, but I have never had dhal like this, it's warm and comforting and exiting all in one and amazing with cheese naan. The chocolate chai is incredible, it's like a spiced hot chocolate tea, and I loved it. I loved Dishoom so much that I went for breakfast later that week at their location in Shoreditch, which was also amazing. Highly recommend the masala beans there. I LOVE DISHOOM.

It was a looong wait, an hour in the cold outside. Finally I was shown in and directed to the bar in the basement cos my table was apparently still not ready. It was a little surprising as I was walking by a bunch of empty tables. The bar area was mostly empty, \u00a0it could easily absorb almost everyone standing in the line outside in the cold.. \u00a0But hey, \u00a0that's not my worry.. \u00a0As I am inside now and it is warm.. \u00a0Nice. Finally I am shown to the table that was empty all the time I was standing at the bar. The menu is unique by basically having a few different choices but mostly just renaming most of the usual Indian restaurant food. By this time I am just excited to be sitting at my table and I go ahead and order the usual chicken and paneer dishes. And now I wait... Well actually, the wait was not long.. \u00a0Surprisingly it just took them two mins to bring my food.. \u00a0Part of me was very excited till I started to taste cold chicken tikka, cold romali roti and chicken Ruby which was just a bland tasting butter chicken with dry boneless chicken pieces ... Suggestions - \u00a0don't make people wait for hours in the cold to make the demand appear to be above capacity. Try and make food at order so it gets to the table not cold like it was waiting to be picked up ten mins ago. Overall - like I said earlier, \u00a0most of the time, no food Is worth an hour waiting in line, freezing London cold or not. If you are one of those folks reading reviews standing in that line, Take this advice - Go walk over to Talli Joe, a 5 mins walk to Soho and enjoy better food and amazing cocktails.",

The bacon naan was good but it didn't wow me as the other two dishes. We also got their house chai tea and cappuccino. I received a refill of the team but wasn't charged for it. Not sure if they offer free refills or if this was an exception. Truly a unique dining experience and I'm hopeful someone will open a similar restaurant in New York.

Once you're inside the atmosphere is charming and the decor is highly polished while still feeling casual.The food is superb. Be sure to try a grill and the Pav Bhaji. Be careful ordering spicy items if you can't handle spicy as they are truly hot, which is a good thing!Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food, although the dishes are not especially large. 2 dishes per person seems to work well.",

    "text": "I have often walked past this restaurant, assuming that it was an upmarket Indian restaurant run by some annoying celebrity. In retrospect I wished I had stopped. The decor is delightful, it feels homely, well thought out and classy. Downstairs you will find snug booths, whilst upstairs intimate tables. Asian newspaper prints line the walls and geometric tiles laiden the floor. However, as grand as this place feels, this is eclipsed by the quality of the food. This restaurant serves authentic Bombay food and they seem very keen on keeping things traditional, although every now and then, with a little kick! The food us down to earth, wholesome, packed with vegetables, seeds, nuts and lashing of fresh herbs and everything I have tried here has been a pure delight! Tasty, fresh and absolutely divine! It's also a good choice for the vegetarians with a lot of meat free, but equally fantastic, options I sampled the keema pau, skate cheeks koliada and the bhel. Whilst an unusual mix, which might sound not to everyone's taste, everything was fresh and tasted fantastic. I couldn't get enough if the skate cheeks and bhel. They were addictive! I also tried the Bombay pimms, a cocktail made with saffron gin, pomegranate and Ginger beer. It was wonderful. I loved every sip. I've been to some great London cocktail bars and whilst you might not expect it from what is primarily an eatery, this tops a lot of them! Plates are reasonably priced, with lots if smaller dishes which can be sampled with friends tapas style. How very social! Highly recommended I can't wait to return to try out some of their other delightful offerings.",

    "text": "For the full post and photos please refer to hungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  The good thing about food blogging I find is not only that fact that I can eat out all the time and call it research, but also that I have met lovely and interesting people through it. So I caught up with my favourite blogging friends LoveLeluu and The Happiness Project London at Dishoom. All three of us wanted to try this so called 'Bombay cafe' which opened earlier this year in Covent Garden as we were possibly the only people left in London who had never been there before. Dishoom is fantastic place modeled after the original Bombay cafes in India which were opened by Persian immigrants in the early 20th century and were an integral part of Indian city life for decades. According to the Dishoom website they are characterized by the 'distinct comfortable look of faded elegance'. Apparently there are only very few original Bombay cafes left in India, two of them are Britannia and Leopold's (really does not sound terribly Indian if you ask me). Dishoom wants to 'capture this disappearing tradition' and serves typical dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I absolutely loved the design. Starting from old Indian movie posters, black and white photos and retro advertisement to Indian newspapers, ceiling fans and and lamps hanging from the ceiling on long electrical cables (we were told they were designed after the lighting at Bombay train station) Dishoom makes you feel like you have entered another world and another period. The nice thing about the menu at Dishoom is that it is relatively short for an Indian restaurant and you can choose from a variety of very reasonably priced smallish dishes to share. We ordered so much food and most of it was very tasty. There is no clear distinction between starters and main and we received the dishes as they were ready. The Vegetable Samosas (2.90) were light and non-greasy filled with nicely seasoned, slightly spicy vegetables. They were served with 3 different chutneys, one rather spicy one, one yogurt-based one full of beautiful coriander flavour and the third with the sweet-sour flavour of tamarind. I am usually not a big fan of fish fingers but I really liked the Dishoom version (3.90) with lovely light crispy batter on the outside and tender flaky fish literally melting in my mouth within. The Spicy Lamb Chops (9.70) flavoured with oriental spices and black pepper were tender and succulent if not really that spicy. I love paneer and it therefore had to be the spicy sweet mushroom and paneer salad (6.90). A lovely fresh dish with home-made crumbly grilled paneer, grilled peppers an mushroom as well as salad leaves. The Chicken Berry Biryani (7.50) was easily the best biryani I have ever tasted. A bowl of aromatic, perfectly cooked Basmati rice infused with different spices such as cardamon and intermingled with chicken pieces and berries. The perfect winter comfort dish actually, delicious. Least successful were the Grilled Masala Prawns (8.90). The prawns were a bit overdone and didn't blow me away flavourwise either. We finished our meal with Fresh Mint Tea (1) and House Chai (1.90). I really enjoyed the mint tea while The Happiness Project London was transported back to India upon tasting the chai. The service was excellent. We got the dishes explained, told about the history behind Dishoom and were brought myriads of miniature glasses with tab water. In fact this is my only criticism \u00a0to serve tab water in tiny glasses (2 sips and it's gone) and they neither have bigger ones nor carafes. In the end it seems a bit of a waste of man power to constantly bring new glasses with water, but what do I know? By the way, you can't book at Dishoom but we easily got a table on Wednesday around 8 so just give it a try when you are in this area, I promise you, you won't regret it.",

The fun and relaxed atmosphere is echoed in the decor and the staff. You can't pre-book for small groups, but I've never struggled to get a seat \u00a0evenings or weekend. The waiting staff will be more than happy to talk you through the menu, which features a number of 'small plates' as well as grills and side dishes (rice, bread etc). My personal recommendations are the calamari (and everyone at the Qype event with me agreed), the Keema Pau (a spice minced lamb dish), and of you're having a curry of any description you must get one of Dishoom's amazing (and HUGE!) rotis to sop up the juices.",

    "text": "So There I am, telling everyone how cool Dishoom is, and it turns out I haven't even written a review of the place! So here goes :)I've been to Dishoom a fair few times. Usually what happens is I look at the menu, give the very patient and friendly waiting staff a hard time over how I can get this stuff much cheaper in East London, with bigger portion sizes, and have a bit of banter about how they aren't allowed to change the menu or ask for things to be changed.Each time the food arrives and I shut up and eat it because it tastes so lovely.The pau bhaji is just like my mum used to make, only they are much tighter on the bread than my mum was. They give you enough bhaji for 4 bread but you only get 2. The same goes for a few more of their dishes.The bacon naan rolls are quite possibly the best bacon based product I have ever eaten.The chai is lovely.And they have this Bombay mojito thing that is really nice and refreshing.So, I'd give this place 5 stars except for the following:1. The menu items can't really be customised2. Portion sizes are really tight for the price you pay3. The bar is downstairs and really dark. It would be much nicer if it was upstairs and the dining area was downstairs (and a bit brighter).But it's a great place \u00a0you should try it. And try their new branch in Shoreditch too because it'll be better :)",

Wir wurden vom sehr stylishen Eingangs- und Hauptraum runtergef\u00fchrt, in den Keller, der besser f\u00fcr gr\u00f6\u00dfere Gruppen geeignet ist. Hier sitzt man unter Rundb\u00f6gen an gro\u00dfen Tischen auf B\u00e4nken und genie\u00dft etwas mehr Privatsph\u00e4re. Es ist zwar etwas dunkler aber dennoch irgendwie cool und schick. So kennt man indische Restaurants gar nicht! Es ist also etwas moderner hier, genauso wird auch das Essen und trinken im Dishroom ein wenig moderner interpretiert. Klassische indische Details wie Koreander oder Safran werden mit beliebten englischen K\u00f6stlichkeiten wie Pimms gemischt. Das Personal ist \u00fcberzeugt von dem, was es verkauft und das merkt man. Voller begeisterung erkl\u00e4rte uns z.B. der Barkeeper, was alles in seinem Bombay Pimms drin ist und obwohl es danach klang, als m\u00fcsse der Cocktail eigentlich nach Curry schmecken, schmeckte er sehr frisch, leicht und lecker. Auch das Essen war w\u00fcrzig aber nicht zu scharf. Genau richtig. Ein sch\u00f6nes Restaurant f\u00fcr alle, die es gerne etwas ausgefallener und stylisher haben. ___________________The first of the three stations of our Covent Garden Crawl by Qype was very stylish. It's an Indian restaurant which mixes traditional food with modern and british elements. A good example would be the Bombay Pimms, which is an ordinary Pimms, pimmed with safran, coriander and other very indian ingredients. It was really tasty which was surpring to me \u00a0I thought it must taste like a curry or something. But it was fresh, delicious and just like a well spiced Pimms.The food was yummy, as well. It was not to greasy and had just the right amount of spices. To conclude:The Dishroom is a very nice, modern and stylish Indian restaurant which I absolutely recommend to all of you!",

    "text": "I'm reviewing this on the basis of one visit, on a wet Sunday in the late afternoon. We arrived having been soaked and were warmly greeted, seated near the tandoor (the warmest place), offered towels and hot tea. A very good start.Our server was a young chap by the name of Lokesh. We explained that we were ravenous having missed lunch, and Lokesh kindly took us through how much we might have needed to order. He also explained that food arrives as it is cooked, this is a cafe not a restaurant (even though, as cafes go, this is more like a restaurant than any other cafe I've been to).Food arrived, and was delicious! Skate cheeks \u00a0lovely chunks of fish coated in spiced gram flour and flash fried and served with fenugreek and coriander with red chilli dip, tamarind, spicy tomato sauce and mint, coriander and green chilli sauce. Yum. Sheel kebab were meltingly soft, as they should be, with a satisfying bite of ginger and green chilli. Clumsily we both ended up ordering the same main dish, a lamb biryani. This arrived 'dum' style, sealed with a pastry lid. The lamb was cooked soft and the rice was nicely moist still. A good balance of spicing which was offset with a raita which we asked for as an accompaniment.Dessert was a Gola Ice, shaved ice and tamarind for that sweet/sour/savoury edge (kala khatta), kind of like a Coke might taste, Indian style. It was lovely but probably one for a very hot day rather than the soggy one we had experienced, can't criticise Dishoom for that.Cocktails (pomegranate juice, gin, martini and a hint of line juice \u00a0yum) and Nimboo Pani (lemon juice, mint, sparkling water, sugar and a hint of spice) accompanied the meal.Delicious, good service which was attentive and 'felt' rather than rehearsed. A delightful place which I'll visit again. I gather a new branch is opening soon (in Shoreditch).",

The service is attentive and friendly. The food is very reasonably priced, we ate like a king for \u00a320/head. Highlights include hot sweet chai, spicy lamb chops sprinkled with pomegranate jewels, a solid chargrilled chicken, bacon nan, spicy chip butties (to try next time for carb overload). Perfect a relaxed lunch with girlfriends post covent garden shopping or for a local chilled business lunch. Ps grab a booth and relax(Covent Garden, Shoreditch branches so far) (monikasays.com )",

Order large or small plates; breakfast, lunch or dinner items \u00a0all at once or as you like! The lightly fried squid and the skate pieces (yes really!) are wonderful as are the range of accompanying dips. The ambience is as cool and mutlicoloured as the cocktails even though the latter were a tad weak for my taste.

    "text": "3.5Apparently a trip to London is not complete without visiting Dishoom - if you're in the area I'd definitely check it out (there's a few locations around London).Came on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away. The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique. I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared. There's cut-outs of articles on the wall and marble tables...it's quite aesthetic I have to say. I wasn't too overly impressed with the service, in fact I would say that's what takes away part of the stars for my rating. The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food (I definitely do, ahem)...in any case the food arrived swiftly. I got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese (tofu like texture) and the naan t accompany it (costs extra) and my friend got the biryani. The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours (can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back). However, this place was quite pricey for lunch...I'd go back occasionally if it was in my route. For the price I'd expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare. In all not a bad experience and if you're in the area (Trafalgar Square) definitely venture in!",

I immediately noticed this restaurant is decorated and serves food from more of a colonial perspective, whereas in the Bay Area, it seems more homey. I guess this isn't too much of a surprise given the history between the two countries.We had:-KEEMA PER EEDU:A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicate morsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs and sali crisp-chips. Served with home-made buns. This was my boyfriend's dish and he loved it. Said it was better than the typical versions he had of this and that the buns were delicious.-DATE & BANANA PORRIDGE:Organic porridge oats cooked with milk, banana and sweet Medjool dates We weren't sure what to expect with this dish but both really enjoyed it. The banana gave it a fresh flavor and the dates sweetened the porridge without making it too sweet. This is free refills but honestly, one bowl was enough for the two of us.-EGG NAAN ROLL:Two fried free-range eggs with saffron-yellow, runny yolks. Warm and most gratifying I ordered this because it seemed unique. It was but the sauce may be a bit sweet for some.-Chai tea: pricey but deliciousI really enjoyed this spot and will have to come for dinner next!",

    "text": "Dishoom was our first dinner in London! It was beautiful weather so standing in line for about 40 minutes didn't seem like a chore! They provided us with lemonade in line and then sent us inside to the next part of the line, which was the bar area. Their seating/waiting system was really well thought out and seemed very efficient! We were seated in under an hour, which was our original quote time. The food was delicious! We tried a lot of entrees and were absolutely stuffed by the end. We ordered the paneer tikka & vegetable samosas to start, all were delicious. The flavor on the paneer was good! The chutneys that are served with the breads and starters are amazing! For dinner we ordered the Lamb Boti Kabab- grilled lamb, which was perfectly cooked and so tasty. The Chicken Tikka flavor was great, the meat is chicken thigh, so be aware if you aren't a fan of dark meat! The Chicken Ruby was also interesting and tasty- a sweet and spicy sauce, it was a unique chicken dish! We also ordered the Gundpowder Potatoes- SO GOOD, probably my favorite thing we ordered, a variety of spices that really was a perfect combination. A few naan bread as well! To finish we had the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. I would say the food is well priced and tasty! They have a smaller menu, but that allows them to get food out quickly- if you are looking for a lot of the classics you won't necessarily find them here. Everyone at the table was impressed with the food. Service at our table is where our review turns a little negative. Service from our specific server was a little lack luster- we had to ask someone else for water that was walking buy with a pitcher. Our server left and went on break during our meal, and so we were left with no one to get our check or clear our table. We waited a significant amount of time and didn't spot her, but finally saw her come back in with take away food for her break after 25 minutes. Thankfully we were able to steal a waiter from another area to help us get our check. Overall it was a fun experience- I wish the service at the table would have been as stellar as the service during our wait! Food was good!",

Paneer Tikka (7.70)4. House Black Daal (5.90)5. Chicken Berry Britannia (9.50)6. Chicken Ruby (9.50)7. Garlic Naan (2.90)8. Steamed Basmati Rice (2.90)Every single dish was outstanding! If I had to choose my top 3 dishes to order they would be the Prawn Koliwada, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and House Black Daal. But honestly, you cannot go wrong with any dish you order! The Prawn Koliwada was so crisp and fresh and the chutney was unlike any I've ever had! I was so obsessed. Both the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and House Black Daal were so flavorful and rich in the best way. The chicken in the Dishoom Chicken Tikka was tender and juicy and cooked so nicely.The service here is fantastic and the ambiance is very fun and trendy. If you have not been here before and you're visiting London, Dishoom is a must! My family and I arrived here around 4pm and waited for about an hour! Apparently the wait is much longer near dinner time so if you're flexible I would definitely come as early as possible! Would love to come back to Dishoom the next time I am in town.",

The queue was obviously long. But worth the wait. Mostly for such hospitable waiters who came by with different drinks like warm chai tea or sherry wine or lemonade. All so delicious too. Then it started raining and they brought out large umbrellas!The staff, for working at such a popular, busy restaurant, were friendly, upbeat, and playful! I loved that they weren't grudgingly leading the next millionth customer to a table.Can we talk about the atmosphere? The hanging lights? The beautiful decor? I was head over heels for everything. Even the toilet!The lamb chops were definitely delicious. My friend ordered garlic naan to share, and I was surprised the garlic was actually so present in comparison to other sad naans I've had. Definitely wouldn't mind using up another London trip to eat here again. Beware of an hour wait though! It'll be worth it.",

My friends and family have heard me rave about it for years and I still stand by the fabulous menu! My husband and I visited the covent garden location on a Friday evening back in April - literally during peak dinner hours. I knew we would have about a 2 hour wait so we made sure to have a snack beforehand. Loved that the host outside was handing out piping hot glasses of chai, it helped make the wait in the rain a little better. We were finally seated in the downstairs dining area and it was bustling with people, just as I remember it on Friday evenings. When I was in grad school, dishoom was my weekly indulgence of Indian street food and I had the menu memorized forward and backwards. I liked seeing that most of my favorites were still on the menu - black dal, gunpowder potatoes, paneer tikka and murgh malai. We tried a new dish this time, which I really enjoyed as well, the goan shrimp curry. Everything tasted fresh and so delicious! I still feel like this is some of the best Indian food you can find in London!",

But, Dishoom is the rare exception I will make. I came at 9 PM and had to wait 70 minutes to be seated, but after hearing the hype, I knew I had to verify. (also 1 hour is probably the furthest I'll be masochistic for)I ordered the jackfruit biryani, chicken ruby, and plain naan. I'd been starving all day, but wow this was incredibly filling. The ruby was my favorite. Think tender chicken with a rich, silky makhani sauce. Essentially a curry with spice and flavor. Smooth like butter. The biryani was great too - a veggie option to balance out the savoriness of the ruby. The sauces that came with the dishes were also incredible, with a spectrum of yogurt sauce and spicy sauce and in between. Overall, I appreciated the breadth and depth of the menu options as well as the accommodating items they served with them to ensure anyone will be satisfied regardless of taste preference. The restaurant was beautiful as well. They give you a newspaper like menu in a headline-like fashion featuring the different menu options, while giving an overarching background story about the restaurant's mission on the top header. Found it pretty cute. Even took it home for kicks and giggles to memorialize this visit.",

    "text": "We booked Dishoom for our office Christmas Party dinner because our events coordinator is totally bomb. That also means we didn't have to wait for 2 hours outside!! HAZAHHHHH!!! This is now my third visit to Dishoom, and to be quite honest, it has only gotten better and better for me. I'm not even quite sure how to describe this experience because it was so amazing. Well, they have a Christmas dinner option with different price options. We had the \u00a330 option which included 3 starters, and 5 entrees, and an option of 1 dessert. It was family style and there was so much food. Anyway, the point is you should go for Christmas dinner because it's awesome, and if it's not Christmas, you should still go because it's delicious. See below for my fav dishes: \u00a0Bhel (crunchy puffed rice tossed with fresh pomegranate, tomato, onion, lime, tamarind, mint)- it's a lovely starter with especially nice textures and very fresh. Samosas- because samosas. Jackfruit Biryani- The jackfruit tastes like chicken- it's even got the texture of chicken and it's very confusing for a vegetarian but also a wonderful experience. Hahahahaha so weird. Anyway, the rice itself has fantastic flavour and a good amount of spice. One of my favourite dishes \u00a0fo sho. Sometimes rice makes me nervous because I feel like it'll be too dry, but this rice is so great and perfectly balanced. Mattar Paneer- Creaaaammmy baby! It's just so good. The sauce is the magical thing. It's so rich and delectable. The paneer is a nice touch, but I'd just take the sauce with the peas. Delish. House Black Daal- So, the first time I tried this dish, I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know what it was. But the second time... holy guacamole batman, this shit hit the spot. (apparently I start to sound super American when I get very enthusiastic about something and I'm now starting to notice it as I type). BUT FOR REAL GUYS THIS DISH IS SERIOUSLY LIKE THE BEST. There you go. The flavours are so deep, and it's like the flavour just gets deeper and more delicious as you eat it. Their mango Kulfi on a stick is absolutely amazing. I was so full but I managed to eat mine and two other people's because they were so creamy and delightful! ***random side note*** I was actually very upset towards the end of our meal because there was so much food left over and I didn't want it to go to waste. (We were going to a bar afterwords) I started freaking out a little bit and eating way more than normal, but wasn't hardly making a dent. Then I had the genius idea of just taking it all with us out and back home. So I did. And I brought it to work the next day and fed everyone twice! WINNING!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and of course I also kept extra for myself. I LOVE DISHOOM.",

    "text": "My hubby and I came here because of how many good reviews this place has. When we walked up to the restaurant it looked very nice but noticed there was a long line waiting outside (not a good start since it was very windy and cold that night). A lady came up to us to let us know it'd be about 1 hr wait and although we were pretty hungry we decided to wait. Outside looking in we could see a long row of empty tables, which we assumed was for a large group who had reserved (funny I saw a review that said they don't take reservations...hmm?). We waited about 30 min outside. We then were lead downstairs to wait inside at the bar for another 20 min or so until we finally got seated upstairs. Looking around we still noticed the long row of empty tables with no group.The food honestly was not the best. I liked it but back in FL I've had much better Indian food with wayyy tastier garlic naan bread. Our server was very nice but didn't check up on us as much as we would've liked (that could be a UK thing though, since we are from the US the servers are always coming up to ppls tables to check up on them). The drinks were good though(1 star for the drinks)After about 10 min of us at the table finally we see the big group come in to sit at the long empty row of tables. I'm pretty sure everyone that was waiting outside in the cold could've sat at those tables and been done eating by the time that group arrived. I've never been to a restaurant where they reserve your table for more than 10 min for your group to arrive and have waiting customers outside in the cold. Even with all that I wouldn't have been so annoyed if only the food was to die for but it wasn't. It really wasn't all that great.",

I got the cobada colada (I think, it's a tongue twister!) It was absolutely delish and tasted like a vacation in a glass.Once seated, our waitress was incredibly kind and recommended a bunch of stuff. We went with the black daal, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, rice, and garlic naan. All were so flavorful and tasty. Our favorite dish was the chicken ruby. All dishes are meant to be shared. Everything is also very reasonably priced in my opinion (nothing we got was over 10.) \u00a0For a restaurant with over 1200 Yelp reviews, I see why! A unique and exciting food experiance.",

Unfortunately we came later on in the evening and our waiter was apparently ready to go. He rushed us to order, didn't refill our beverages, and didn't even check on us until he brought the check. We had to tell one of the other waiters to find our waiter for us. Since we were rushed to order and didn't get to thoroughly look through the menu we just ordered a few different tapas. Then he kept telling us to order more because what we had wouldn't be enough...it was wayyyyyy too much food! Some good, some just ok. My favorite was the okra fries. I devoured them! The prawns were pretty good just very spicy. I also liked the chicken wrap, basmati rice, and chicken ruby. The samosas were just ok. I didn't care at all for the potatoes. And I don't even recall the bread. This was my first time trying Indian food and I liked the flavors for the most part.",

The Ruby's chicken is basically chicken tikka masala but a bit sweeter and creamier than most. The lamb is basically a vindaloo that was amazingly delicious. The kids portion was big as well. It is NOT a great place for vegetarians. And it's not great for the waistline I'm guessing. But you must go if in London!",

Some may say it's better than what they've had in India (I would agree, but I've only been to Sri Lanka).It's tough to get a table, so definitely book in advance. The staff is as friendly and helpful with choosing dishes, so do take advantage of that.Literally every dish was incredible and fresh - it really opened my eyes to what Indian food can taste like with great ingredients. I got the chicken masala, various naan, and some starters. It's pricey, yes, but you get what you pay for! Definitely worth the effort if you want to plan a great meal London - won't disappoint.",

Quality of the food is still impressive and the drink I had at the bar while I waited for my table also didn't disappoint. Will probably make this a regular stop whenever I visit London, if only so I can try other items off the menu.",

    "text": "Really fantastic Indian restaurant. Before I came to London, 3 different people told me that I absolutely had to go to Dishoom, even if I took none of their other recommendations. The first time, I tried to make reservations on my birthday (a Sunday night in November) for myself and two friends, but I found out that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. So we prepared ourselves for the long wait and got in the queue around 5:30. The staff was handing out chai and mint tea for those waiting outside. We were outside for around 45 minutes before getting led to the bar downstairs, where we waited for another 20 minutes. After that, our waitress led us upstairs and we were finally seated in the warm, beautifully decorated dining area. I ordered a cup of the house chai right away (the samples really work), and my friends ordered mango lassis, which were refreshingly light compared to other ones I've had. We then ordered a bunch of different dishes to share between the three of us: Vegetable samosas, cheese naan (takes naan to the next level -- try it!!), paneer tikka, chicken ruby, mattar paneer, black dahl, and gunpowder potatoes. It really was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I think the black dahl was my favorite dish because I love lentils and it tasted the most unique. I don't eat meat, but the curry that came with the chicken ruby was fantastic. The chutneys that are served with the samosas are really wonderful -- ask for extra to eat with your rice. The service here is very, very good -- we had 2 different waiters checking in on us but we never felt rushed or annoyed. When I came with a different friend a Monday night, she ordered the Chicken Tikka thinking that it came with curry, but it was just the meat by itself. She asked if it was possible to get Chicken Tikka Masala instead -- and in under a minute, they'd replaced her dish without any hesitation. Everything about Dishoom is wonderful, from the food to the staff to the decor. I've never heard about anyone having a negative experience here. Whether you're in London for months, weeks, or days, definitely put this restaurant on your list.",

    "text": "4.5 stars.Walked up to the restaurant's queue around 6:25pm, ended up seated within 45 minutes (pretty good considering I was prepared to wait up to an hour and 20 min as the hostess had suggested). While you wait in line, another hostess will offer samples of the House Chai to ease up your hunger.I dined solo and was seated at a small table instead of the bar so I was able to relax a little more. The staff were wonderfully attentive, great service and my waiter made sure to keep an eye out for me whenever I needed something. Based on the Yelp reviews, I ordered the vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, and garlic naan, and everything was delicious! The chicken ruby was spicier than I expected (I tend to eat mild to low-medium spicy, this was a little further along the medium range imo), and in hindsight I should've ordered some rice to offset it a little. I also requested still water, but I guess this meant bottled water and so I was charged another \u00a33 for this (oops...next time I'll be sure to say \"tap\").All in all, it's a pricier establishment but you won't be disappointed with the food at all. I may have to come back here to try other dishes before I leave London.",

    "text": "I haven't (yet) embraced the idea of queuing outside for 45mins for a burger & chips, but I'm happy to queue up for Dishoom for some reason. Okay, actually for three reasons: 1) they give you free boozy chai outside, 2) once in, you wait in the cool little bar downstairs, and 3) the food is good. Okay fine, it's *mostly* the free bourbon-spiked chai!When it comes to Indian restaurants, if a place can make me forget my 'it's no mum's cooking!' feelings and come back for more, then I figure it's doing something right. Dishoom with its bustling Bombay teahouse feel is definitely doing so. From the low hanging glass lamps (like wiring was an afterthought), old family photos on the walls and vintage medicines and toiletries on display in the loos, everything invites you in for a closer look.Food-wise everyone will have their faves, but I've found the bhel has a great kick, pau bhaji is yum (though I like mine with more onion on top) and the house black daal is worth a try. Need to go again with some non-veggies to try more meat dishes I think but skip the lamb boti kabab (other grills yet to be investigated), and get a side of okra fries no matter what else you're having.Drinks-wise there's a nostalgia hit for me from getting chai in authentic glass cups, and seeing Limca on the menu (basically it's their 7UP - my sis and I got addicted to this on a childhood trip to India!). Fusion cocktails work with differing degrees of success - wasn't much chai in the chaijito but the bombay pimms was better. Still working on trying them all.The overall package is a hit for me anyway. Decent value dishes too, though the whole small-plate-sharing thing always means you end up ordering loads! Though it always seems to get finished off somehow... :)",

They were serving free small drinks to those waiting in line, which is very nice. All the staff were pleasant. On to the food--My husband and I are curry lovers, and their curry is definitely one of the best we've ever had. Even the rice was spectacular--how does one even make Basmati rice spectacular??? I don't know, but they sure did. I was looking at starters and desserts, but all we had to eat was that one curry and we were so stuffed and satisfied. I will also note, I have Celiac Disease and the wait staff was very well informed and kind when dealing with me and my needs. There are plenty of gluten free options on the menu. I didn't get sick at all, which means their kitchen did what was necessary to keep my food safe during preparation. Overall, a great experience.",

Food is great tasting and great value, and the other reviews on here will be testament to what I just said too.The only areas for improvement are:- it is ridiculous how long the door staff say you have to queue sometimes, and they could clean & turn the tables a little faster. There have been times when we've been waiting at the bar only to spot at least 4-5 free tables. It's a restaurant, not a high end club so stop with the unnecessary queuing!! - could intro more new dishes to the menu for regulars. We've been going once every week/10 days for over two years now and there's only been a couple of new additions to the menu.",

    "text": "I love this place. Dishoom was recommended to me before I moved to London by an Indian friend born and raised in London and another local. I really didn't understand what 'Indian street food' is and how this is any different than other Indian places I've been.Well it is. I've brought multiple people whenever they are visiting from the US. I think it was best when my best friend, claims to be a staunch hater of Indian food, agreed to eat there and proclaimed she could find items she liked. Ca ching.Ordering: House Black Daal is a MUST. So buttery, so smooth. I dream about this.I really enjoy the murgh malai. Very tender chicken. Note it might come out pink but it is cooked through (don't be scared). \u00a0Definitely add one or two orders of the garlic naan.Other food dishes (just not as awesome) include pau bhaji (spicy). Chicken berry britannia (unique with the cranberries) and chicken ruby.There is always a queue as they don't accept evening reservations for groups under 6. The staff working the door are friendly and they bring you hot chai while you wait. You may also find yourself singing 'warm kitty' in queue.Continuing on service, each time I have gone all servers have had a smile on their face and been very helpful. But my favorite is Sapna. Beautiful, friendly, helpful with ordering - she is a gem at Dishoom. Enjoy your meal. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "I'm now officially obsessed with this place having come for breakfast two Saturdays in a row, lured by the Keema Per Eedu. It's a decadent mixture of chicken mince, delightfully spiced, accompanied by chicken livers and topped with two runny eggs and crunchy potato sticks. My usual approach is to squeeze in a bit of lime juice, then put a yolk and a few healthy spoonfuls into a pau bun. The dish is really flavorful, and the spices leave you mouth tingling. A swig of house chai will confoundingly heighten the spice for a second before cooling the fires and preparing you for your next bite. It borders on too much food, so rich, but is clearly my new crush. Oh, and by the way, the husband and three kids also come along but it's more about me than them. Booking for breakfast makes seating for a family of five a breeze. My kids (ages 3, 7, 9) are well fed from selections like Fire Toast (thick, hearty slices of lightly charred toast and interesting jams), Bun Maska (a fluffy bun, split and buttered, served with chai), house porridge (never-ending portion and flavored of banana and dates), house granola and fruit and yogurt. My husband's tried the Big Bombay and the Bacon Roll on naan. I'm just enamored with Dishoom and now working up the courage to wait in line one evening for dinner.",

We followed his recommendations and also ordered garlic naan on the side. The food didn't take terribly long considering how busy they were, and we tried it out.Hands down, this was the best taste out of ALL the restaurants my family went to, spanning the food in Paris, Venice, Rome, and Prague. \u00a0The blend of aromatic spices in the daal, perfectly tender and juicy grilled chicken (both the Murgh Malai and Tikka were good, but I would recommend the Tikka for flavor), and the perfect pinch of cilantro, red onion, and tomato? medley all led to a superb tasting meal. \u00a0The only gripe was the cost - the single meat portions are a bit small, so we ended up ordering 3 portions for the 2 of us, and altogether everything cost 43\u00a3! \u00a0It was a bit of a surprise, but I guess it is London after all. \u00a0You can get by with a 10-15\u00a3 order per person but we were just too hungry at the time. \u00a0Other than that one minor drawback, this should hands-down be your #1 destination for food during your stay in London.",

They said it would be a 50 minute wait...UGH....we're tied and hungry....other in the line insist it is worth the wait and they're all locals. We opt to wait....someone comes out with a tray of Chai tea in shot glasses. The time passes quickly and we get in the door and are handed a pager. We're ushered to the downstairs small bar area. The drink menu is unique, I opt for a non-alcholic watermelon and mint drink that was outstanding and fresh. We wait a few minutes when the pager goes off and we are brought to this huge table that is a horseshoe shaped private booth...it's intimate, quiet and out of the way. The service is great as they explain that everything is ment to me shared, and suggest we get 7-9 dishes for the 3 of us. Not knowing the portion size we order 2 of the vegetable Biriyani. It turns out to be too much and sadly we can't take it home with us. Everything is different and unique. Grilled shrimp were to die for. Cheese bread!! The dessert chocolate pudding was pure heaven. This place would be worth a trip back, it truly was a fabulous restaurant, fantastic staff and service, decor and food!!! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!! FYI, NYC is hungry and waiting!!!",

On a recent business trip to London I visited this place twice and would be going there for lunch right now if I wasn't 5,000 miles away. =(The Dishoom Chicken Tika was superb in both its tenderness and spiciness. If you like Chicken Tikka Masala then you can do no better by ordering the Chicken Ruby. The spicy richness of this curry dish was sublime, and far more complex than most Indian joints reach for. Two thumbs up in my book. Not to be left out is the House Black Dal, which being from Texas, reminded me of meatless chili. But I mean that in the best way possible. It was fantastic and I could not get enough of it. Their roti was fine, however the naan was by far not the best I've ever had. That said, I didn't come to Dishoom for bread. The decor of the place is pretty classy and if there's a line, which there will be on most evenings it seems, don't be afraid of it. Just wait it out as the food comes quickly and the line moves rather swiftly. In summary, Dishoom = Boom, goes the dynamite.",

Our waiter was friendly and kindly recommended some dishes for us to share.We ordered some naan and a few curries to share, including the house black daal which was quite dark and rich.I ordered the House Chai, and also redeemed my free mango lassi as it was my first visit. Felt so full (but happy) towards the end :pOn my second visit, me and my friend dropped in for brunch. I tried the chocolate chai this time, which was very warming and comforting after coming in from the cold outside.I finally tried the much talked about bacon naan roll which had chilli tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs. Warm and freshly made, though I would have preferred more of a kick from the chilli (me and my love for spiciness...) We also ordered the Akuri - spicy scrambled eggs, which is an Irani staple. A lovely blend of spices - I may actually try this at home sometime and add some excitement to my scrambled eggs, ha.Overall I enjoyed the food, and also the ambience of the place. A wide variety of small dishes to share and centrally located close to Covent Garden/Leicester Square station.Full blog post here: dancing-in-high-heels.bl\u2026",

    "text": "YUM. Definitely not cheap Indian food but reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. The small plates (or tapas style) are fantastic and easy to share. Food came quickly, though service was a bit slow, and the restaurant is super packed (people kept bumping into my chair). Came here around 6:30pm on a Wed night. Calamari - Very tasty but small portions. The seasoning was fantastic.Chicken Berry Biryani - Oooo that spice! Amazing biryani though nothing special when compared to other biryani's i've had. Pretty spicy, be warned. Mango and Paneer salad - The dressing was great. Very refreshing and worth getting tp balance out the heavier dishes. Daal - DELICIOUS. Can you taste the butter? Mmmm. I couldn't stop picking at this even when I was way past stuffed.Naan - StandardThe waiters will try to push food on to you. We were prepared to order three things and the waiters kept telling us it was not enough. Um. Trust me. We had so much food left over, we felt guilty... and we were stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. Start out with three dishes (maybe 2 mains and a starter for two) and build on that if you want. All the above, plus a mango lassi (Seems thinner and more watered down than most places. Not sure if I like that.) and chai (fantastic chai! though they only give you a tiny tiny cup... not a fan), was 20 quid per person. Again, not crazy expensive, but not cheap for Indian food either.",

The food was all perfectly cooked, the okra fries were moreish, the chilli cheese toast was a very generous portion, both the mattar paneer and chicken ruby curries were flavourful and well spiced and the lamb we had was very tender and cooked perfectly. We also had some delicious desserts such as the Memsahib's Mess and also kulfi which were a brilliant sweet end to the meal. \u00a0The service was also very attentive and the food came quickly. I've been raving about Dishoom to my friend ever since! The only disappointing part of the meal was a large group of children seemingly unattended at a neighbouring table who were incredibly loud however this was a one off and was not the fault of the staff.5*",

Alas, of course, reservations were filled up a week ahead of time, so we decided to endure the queuing b/c it's worth it. And is it worth it. Just come with the right mindset. We went on a Saturday night around 7pm and ended up waiting 2 hours (knowingly). But they make the waiting experience as best as possible: offer chai tea and sherry samples outside, there are heat lamps to keep you warm, and once you're inside, you're sent to the bar to continue the wait but with drinks and nibbles in hand. If you're coming with good company, you don't really notice the wait. Once seated at our table, we had excellent service and of course, don't have to reiterate, the food is to die for. We were literally silent for about 10 minutes while everyone scarfed their food down. My mom always says that the chef's best compliment is silence. ;) Have been told this place is great for breakfast, so will have to do that sometime soon!",

Their chicken tikka is tender and juicy, and the roomali roti (literally \"handkerchief bread\" for its thinness) is awesome for mopping up their curries. It's also a good place to get food that's more representative of Maharashtrian/Gujarati-style Indian cuisine, which is sorely lacking stateside. My dining companion, on one occasion, found the pau bhaji to be sort of overcooked, but I enjoyed it. We need more West Indian restaurants in the US!They don't take dinner reservations (something that seems to be common amongst trendier restaurants in London--I guess to up the hype?) so it can be a wait, but they have a nice bar downstairs and they seat really quickly. I also like the 1960s Bombay kitsch of the decorations--plus they serve Limca in the bottle! What else could you ask for?",

I think it's mainly because this is a well decorated chain, that's the appeal. \u00a0 We've had a few instances here where they haven't been able to adjust the menu even a little to suit our vegetarian friends - which is a shame as it wasn't difficult, then they kicked up a fuss about us, made us feel as though we were really demanding too much - so that's why I'm not giving it four stars.",

The rice was not weighed down by sauces or fillings but rather, it was light and fluffy, mixed with the perfect amount of spices. It was on the spicy side but not flaming hot. Chicken was juicy and the right quantity. I do wish, however, that there were real berries in the dish; the \"berry\" was just cranberries/craisins. Still, the sweetness of the cranberries balanced the spicyness of the chicken and rice. My friends also ordered the Biryani and Dhaba Chicken Curry (\u00a37.50) with naans (\u00a31.70-1.90 each). I don't like the traditional yellow, coconuty-tasting, Indian curries but the Dhaba Chicken was a pleasant red curry and was not heavy at all! I wish it came with naan or rice already; instead, the meal kind of forces you to pay to have it on the side. Attentive service (compulsory tip) and classy place with downstairs seating for more formal gatherings or bigger groups. Definitely trendy and classy restaurant to bring coworkers, clients or friends visiting from out-of-town (:",

Started out with an hour and a half queue in the cold, which could easy have ruined an evening out. However the wait flew by thanks to the rounds of free warm tea and chocolate-bourbon chai. The hostesses were friendly and accommodating and before we knew it we were waiting inside at the bar. The cocktails are great. I had the Bombay Bellini, consisting of raspberries, lychees, rose & prosecco. Seriously delicious. Like if I had one wish it would be for one of those to appear magically in my hand whenever I was hot and looking to cool down, or just at all times. When we were seated the waitress walked us through the menu. The food is tapas style, several small plats ranging from \u00a32-\u00a38. My boyfriend and I split veggie samosas, paneer tikka (jesus christ that paneer), a lamb rice dish, garlic naan and this fantastic black daal. Everything was incredible, the best Indian food of my life. I was floored by how flavorful (and cheap!) everything was. There was plenty of food for the two of us and our bill rounded up to a lovely \u00a356,81.So yeah the food is to die for and the cocktails are delicious, but what really put my visit to Dishoom over the top was the service. Every single staff member was so genuine and friendly, with out being over the top. Attentive and warm, with plenty of helpful information regarding the menu items. When I mentioned to the manager how impressed I was she bought us a round of drinks! Like what?? What is this magical place of delicious affordable wonderment?It's Dishoom. That's what it is. 5/5 all the way.",

    "text": "I've done it - completed the Dishoom triumvirate. This one is probably the most popular branch of the most popular old-Bombay-style restaurant in London. Right on Upper St Martin's next to Jamie's Italian, there's no hiding from the crowds and that keeps the line outside for weekend brunch consistently long. For us (four people), the wait was about 25 minutes. We were given a buzzer and invited to wait downstairs for a table, though other parties were made to wait outside - not sure why the separation. There is a whole science to the service at Dishoom, designed so the customers never go ANYWHERE unescorted. We were radioed into the restaurant by two hostesses, and then had to check in with the indoor hostess, who directed us downstairs to someone else who showed us where to wait. A fifth staffer brought us to our table, and finally we met the sixth and final staffer, our server. Service is always friendly and they certainly had one of the lowest staff-to-guests ratios I've seen of late. There are tons of staffers buzzing to and fro, one guy in the kitchen who just slaps out chapatis onto the stone oven, and one extremely tall dude whose job seemed to be walking around being extremely tall and good-looking. The only complaint was that we had to prompt for refills on our \"bottomless\" Chai - servers twice took away our empty glasses without offering refills. At Dishoom Shoreditch they always offer refills, so it sucks to have to be aggressive about the \"bottomless\" part here.Anyway, the food - as everyone and their mother have written - is stellar. Enhanced by a charming atmosphere with hanging lights, wooden tables and a general buzz in the air, this is a great place for a weekend catch-up brunch. The naan rolls were generously sized and freshly prepared, while the kerjiwal is greasy, cheesy, spiced, runny-yolk goodness. I liked how the toast didn't get soggy in the time it took to eat the dish. Be prepared for a bit of chaos, but it all goes down easy with the great food, warm service and fun dining room.",

Although they describe themselves as a cafe this is about as far away from Formica tabled greasy spoons as you could get. I've been to Dishoom for dinner and definately think that their strong point is the grills rather than the token curry which was quite bland on the night we went. I would also probably skip the biryani as it did not have much meat in it. I would probably go for the grilled salmon and the huge masala prawns and maybe some of the street food like the pau bhaji. Unfortunately they serve their wine in tumblers rather than wine glasses which, while authentic means the wine gets warm quite quickly. I would also definately stick with the indian desserts, the kulfi was lovely but the chocolate fondant was quite dry. Would I travel out of my way to go to Dishoom? Probably not. Is it a good safe bet if you're in the area? Definately. I will certainly be back now I've figured out which are the hits and misses on the menu.",

    "text": "Wow. I had the worst experience here. \u00a0I was so excited to try this place out for brunch because I had heard great things and decided to come here on my last day in London. In my experience of living in nyc, there doesn't tend to be great ethnic food in the touristy/busy areas so I was skeptical. But I'll never know because I never got to try the food. I came here towards the end of brunch and wanted to order their version of pancakes. They were out of them, fine, I get it, no problem, but for some strange reason the waiter tried to sell me on the yogurt. Because they're both sweet? It's easy to make? Who knows. I said no, thank you. Unfortunately, there wasn't another item that stood out to me but I had already ordered a chai (since I heard it was a must-try, and from the few sips I had, it was fine). I asked if I could just get my check and a to-go cup since I figured I would try to grab my brunch elsewhere. For some reason, despite asking 3 different people this, it still had not happened 25 minutes later. \u00a0Then my waiter came over and told me to give him 5 more minutes. Really? I couldn't believe it. I've worked in a restaurant and I would never treat a customer like that. They made it so I was too late to get brunch anywhere else and put a damper on my last day in the city.",

I was so hungry and I have always been a fan of Dishoom, so why not try their brekkie menu.I ordered the big bombay and house chai. Woaaaaah talk about a big plate of food, a man beast portion to be exact! 4 rashers of streaky charred bacon, akuri - masala scrambled eggs, 2 shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns, and a side of ketchup in a small dish. I managed to eat majority of it, I loved the charred bacon - the slightly bbq, crisp in taste, the pork sausages were ok - nothing special. The akuri was my fave!!! So flavoursome, unique, the blends of spices mixed well and so yum with the buttered pau buns. Their bacon is soured from The Ginger Pig, and it's probably the best I have had!The house chai is definitely bombay style, slight too sweet for my liking, nonetheless perfect for a monday morning. Also they don't take reservations for less than 4, so get there quickly to enjoy the vast array on their menu. if there is 6 or more, do book, they will tell you off if you don't!",

    "text": "Absolutely delicious! All the Indian food suspects kicked up a notch for today's modern tastes. The only complaint that I had was that I didn't have enough room in my stomach to eat everything. It's the kind of place where even the basic side dishes warrant some praise (e.g., bowl of greens). The service was really good and I appreciated that they didn't overseat even though it's clearly a popular place to eat. I'm sure that helps with the service and food for that matter. Expect a wait. We first tried to go in the evening, but it would have taken at least 2 hours. I don't care how good the food is supposed to be, but 2 hours is just too long for me to stand outside in the freezing cold. Yes, I might have been able to get inside and wait for your table earlier at the bar, but that still would have been a long time before that happened. We ended up going to lunch instead the following day and there was a 30 minute wait, with a 15-minute wait outside. Much better!",

Delightful service from Leo throughout.You can't book here and waits can be a while if you come at peak eating times - but come very late morning for an early lunch or mid afternoon for a late one and you'll stroll right in. It's a staple on my London home-eating circuit. And the hundreds of good reviews are entirely deserved.

Every time my friends come to visit, I always bring them to Dishoom and they are without a doubt, extremely pleased and satisfied. There is typically a line, but I've found that if you go at around 11:45, there aren't a ton of people and you can just sit there until their lunch starts. Alternatively, my friends and I have gone at around 9:30, and we only have to wait around 40 min or so. I really, really love this restaurant and I would recommend visiting at least once in London!",

Even if it weren't unlimited, I would get a few. 2) Americano: Decent. Not the best but above average.Service: Our waiter was great. He took the time to explain to us everything on the menu.

She came to our table 4 times to ask how our meal was going, so on top of being checked on by the waiting staff this was a bit of an over kill.",

    "text": "DISHOOM DISHOOM! Is this the sound of a Bollywood punch? \u00a0Or perhaps as the menu suggested, the sound of the food zooming to your table? I tried to figure it out and after eating there, I personally think this is the sound of the flavours exploding in your mouth (Bollywood flavour punch in the mouth?)The dish that had the punch was the famous house black daal, which was really delicious and full of exciting tastes. Nothing else I tried was quite so exciting, but the rightly popular pau bhaji was also a delicious mix of flavours and I loved it too. I have never had pau bhaji before and wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a lovely saucy vegetable mix packed with yumminess that you can eat with garlic naan or whatever bread you prefer. I also really enjoyed the chilli cheese toast, which was such a fun thing to order. Perhaps if I went back I might be able to continue the search for more dishoom flavour! :)Now to less flavoursome dishes. The kacchi lamb biryani was just okay and had not much meat in it, so I wouldn't recommend it. The haleem was better but after a few bites got a bit boring. The masala chai and mango lassi were okay, but I have had better lassi and I don't believe I've ever found a place outside of the subcontinent that can make masala chai the same way. Surprisingly, I did enjoy the interestingly spelled Thums Up soda. Thums Up is the Indian Coca-Cola and tastes as if you left a can of coke next to a sack of cardamom, but in a surprisingly good way. The logo is a hand giving the thumbs up sign, and I really enjoyed the spelling after seeing that. The pistachio kulfi was a good way to end the meal, it wasn't the best I've had but was rich and sweet and hit the spot.As people have said, there is a long wait to get in. I went around 6 and ended up outside in the rain for 45 minutes. Dishoom was kind enough to lend us an umbrella and also to pass out masala chai cups to people in line. I did notice though that after 8:30 on a weekday, there was no line at all, so if you don't want to stand in line, perhaps come around then instead and miss the early rush. Dishoom I notice, also has dates for people who are fasting during Ramadan if you ask for them, and has a special Eid menu coming up which notes that all chicken and lamb are always halal at Dishoom. I really like how considerate they are and look forward to going back again sometime! Their holi celebration also looked amazing on the website and I hope to go next year. They also have something special called a lamb raan bun, which you can only get at the Shoreditch branch, so I will definitely be checking that out!",

We both had no problem admitting this was the best food we had on the trip and the best indian food we've ever had!!!We had the ruby chicken and the vegetable samosas - both were so good. Also the dishoom IPA was a great beer - the best I've which was brewed exclusively for a restaurant. \u00a0If you're going to go, know there is usually a queue. We tried to go early around 5 and still had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of 2. While we were waiting, they came around twice with complimentary chai tea samples which was awesome!This is a place I will go out of my way to visit every time I'm in London. Exceptional service meets even better food and at a really good value - make sure you plan a visit!",

My wife had noticed it too and suggested we try it out for lunch on her birthday. While we didn't have a bacon naan, the decision was inspired and we had a lunch which surpassed our expectations.We chose several dishes which covered most parts of the menu. We ate until we had crossed the line marked \"full\" and we had no regrets. My favourite choice was the spicy lamb chops: great flavour, not overpowering, and as tender as you like. The black house daal was also well-liked.I ordered the house chai and later found out that I could have unlimited refills!

Subsequently, I'm used to very good Indian food, from all regions of India. And when I say very good, I mean excellent.Right, now that that's out of the way...I trust Yelpers implicitly. I've had so many fantastic experiences by following Yelp reviews wherever I travel. Subsequently, I'm a little curious as to how high a rating Dishoom got. Don't get me wrong - it was all good. There was nothing bad about the meal I had. It's just that there was nothing stunning about the food I had. Maybe my expectations were too high as I had to wait almost an hour to get in. Maybe I'm just used to a different style of Indian food (maybe the food in Sydney was adjusted to local tastes?). Maybe I just got there on a not so good night? Or maybe my taste buds were just off?...Regardless, if you're after a good feed, this place will give it to you. It was definitely satisfying. But then, balancing that with the price and the wait, maybe there's somewhere else you could go, for better food, less coin, and less of a wait?",

While you wait in line they provide you drinks outside! Everything we ordered was fantastic. The okra fries were well seasoned and really crunchy. I'm not a fan of okra but these changed my mind. We also ordered the lamb chops , garlic naan, prawn Moilee \u00a0 And phau \u00a0bhaji. Enjoyed every dish equally. Make sure to come here!!!",

I always get the vegetable samosas as a starter - they are crispy and come with three great chutneys (the mint chutney being my favorite). When ordering a main dish one thing to note is that few of Dishoom's items are curry-based, meaning that they are just meat options. If you want something with a curry Mattar Paneer or the Chicken Ruby. I'm a huge fan of the chicken ruby - it's the perfect mix of spicy flavorful and goes well with the Romali Roti. I've also had Lamb Boti Kabobs and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka - both are great but again they just come with meat so I don't recommend ordering a naan or rice with it. This restaurant is usually quite crowded during prime lunch and dinner time but the wait was never terribly long for me. Overall: one of my favorites in London, amazing Indian food, cool ambiance",

While still great, I think the first experience was transcendental, so this one loses a star for not quite matching up. Good points:- It's a fun, attractive, interesting restaurant, with lots to catch the eye.- Food is good quality and tasty.- The chai tea is beautifully done.- The fire toast was simple but tasty.- It's very good value! The bacon naan was \u00a35.20, I think.Less good points (note that these are all in comparison to King's Cross - so are me being picky rather than very unhappy):- The staff seemed very rushed and harried - we didn't really get a smile out of them and felt a little under pressure. The King's Cross branch had much friendlier staff.- I was a bit underwhelmed by my bacon and egg naan - I think my expectations had been built up too much. But in particular, I was annoyed that there were green onions cooked into my egg, because I hate them, and this wasn't on the menu. In addition, my egg wasn't runny. - It's not as interesting a space as King's Cross, despite the details.I'm DEFINITELY going back to Dishoom, but probably for lunch or dinner, and either trying out the Shoreditch one or going back to King's Cross.",

    "text": "Wow - I can see why Yelpers have been making this place popular! We came in hungry - and left with warm happy stomachs. \u00a0The chicken tikka is what really stood out in its awesomeness. The chicken was nice and moist, and sooooo full of flavo(u)r. Order this with naan or garlic naan - and you are (almost) set. I say \"almost\" as the portion sizes are such that the customer is enabled to order a variety of different dishes without \"overeating\". \u00a0(Next time I'll consider ordering two of these and 2xnaan).The calamari was also an excellent dish - a small bowl of very lightly breaded calamari. It was a nice change from what I'm used to - as the calamari isn't completely covered in batter and fried. This is certainly worth a try for a change of pace. The final dish was the real kicker... (by kicker - i mean it kicked us in the ass!). Lamb curry (I think it was listed as Lamb Biryani on this menu). We ordered this with rice as it came with just the main curry, and wow - they kicked it up a nice notch. A fairly spicy dish with not quite as much flavor as the chicken tikka - at least worth a shot for the super hot lovers, but I would have liked a \"fuller\" flavo(u)r. Aside from the food, the service was excellent (especially considering the crowds vs the # of servers), and the atmosphere was cool. It was nice that it was relatively casual for a cool London restaurant spot. I can see us going back for sure.",

We didn't make a reservation at night and it was an estimated 45min wait, but were seated sooner. It would be a good idea to make reservations for dinner I think.",

    "text": "Ever since I discovered Dishoom earlier this year, I've become an ardent fan. What strikes me as the most charming and defining feature of \"Dishoom\" was the concept that it pays homage to, that of, Irani cafes in mid-20th century Bombay. \"Dishoom\" opened its doors in July 2010. Adorned with sepia toned portraiture and popular imagery from the 50s and 60s against the backdrop of powder blue walls, it is obvious that much thought and effort has gone into the decor and cultural referencing. I admit to this bias but given the plethora of Pakistani restaurants in London that serve food exactly how I would enjoy it back home, I rarely venture to Indian restaurants. However, Dishoom has changed that for me. During multiple visits I have enjoyed the simple, clean flavors and moderately spiced food. \u00a0The stellar item on the menu is, undoubtedly, the chai. It's traditional milky tea with a lingering aftertaste of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and a hint of ginger. Amongst the starters/small plates the pau bhaji, calamari, vada pau and bhel stand out. I also enjoy the grilled items accompanied with velvety roomali roti or cheese nans. They also serve delicious breakfast. I have tried the Bombay Omelette and the Bombay Breakfast Bake, both of which were excellent especially the latter. \u00a0 Dishoom is one of the rare restaurants where most items on the menu are standouts and rarely disappoint. It's also good value for money, especially give the central location.",

Sad but true.Sitting down, my server was patient with me and made some great recommendations: - Sheekh Lamb - really enjoyed this - Dhaba Chicken - nothing I would have ever ordered, but I was glad he threw the special at me - very good - Naan - only negative was the Naan wasn't warm when it got to me, but they did have a couple 12 tops clogging things up.Ultimately, this is 3.5 restaurant, but the service rounded it up for me.

Take my review for what it is; as I do not think enough adjectives can describe just how fantastic my meal here was. If I visited Dishoom in the earlier part of my trip, I would've been a regular throughout my entire stay(I went twice during my last two days in London). Absolutely fantastic service, delicious food(the garlic naan and the black daal...!!! Incredible.) a wonderful staff. At first I thought they were just treating me well since I was a solo diner, but no--this service was beautifully delivered in a non-transactional way to all guests in the dining room. Dishoom, you deserve the utmost applause--fantastic service and a fantastically consistent product!",

    "text": "Finally came to eat here after rave reviews - we were the first in the queue outside (arrived at 5:25) but within 5mins there were 10ppl behind us. We ended up only waiting half an hour - got to wait in the bar inside so weren't left in the cold for too long although I know of people who've waited over an hour in the queue outside.I had the Bangha Lassi - absolutely delicious! Could be a dessert tbh. Also had some chai tea, which was nice but doesn't compare to the real stuff (if you've been to India).I'd always heard that Dishoom was \"affordable\" but I honestly thought it was quite pricey considering I got 5 little pieces of lamb kabab - however it was tasty. The calamari and prawn koliwada were probably my favourite dishes. Also the Malai Kulfi and the Pineapple and Pepper desserts were pretty amazing!Best bet is to be in the queue by 5:30pm latest so you only wait between 30-45mins",

We were recommended Dishoom by many locals and had also heard of the amazing breakfast here as well (we'll try that next time.) We came for dinner and I am happy to say that this meal will go down in the Top 3 I have ever had in my life. To compare, a few days before we went to the MOST rated Indian restaurant on Yelp in London, Tayyabs. These places really don't even compare, Tayyabs felt like the Applebee's version of Indian compared to Dishoom. Yes, Tayyabs food was very good, but the service was terrible and the menu is fairly simple in regards to variety in dishes and we were all having flashbacks to Thursday nights at Applebee's in the style of service and menu.Dishoom creates a unique experience from the start and the food is an incredible fusion of retro bombay in the imperial times. If that makes sense, or if it doesn't, just go here and you won't be disappoainted.",

    "text": "I have to confess to being bemused by the great fanfare that accompanies Dishoom. I hadn't heard of it, but love Indian food so was more than happy to give it a try for a dinner with a couple of friends. We pitched up at 7pm, were told that there was an hour wait. Happily I'd had an afternoon snack, so didn't mind waiting but it seems to me that if you're going to make people queue for an hour then you'd better make damn sure there's something worthy of that wait at the other end. We didn't get to sit down and order until about 830pm, with nothing but a small glass of chai tea (which I confess, tasted like it had been made from PG Tips) to sustain us in the interim. On the plus side, our waiter was attentive and helpful once we were seated, making recommendations about what to order, almost all of which we took. Between three of us, we had the Pau Bhaji, which set the tone for the rest of the food, being of a mushy consistency albeit quite tasty with the plain rolls with which it was served. We also ordered the Prawn Koliwada, which turned out to be the tastiest dish of the evening in my opinion. they didn't live up to the waiter's description of them as spicy, but they were very well seasoned, and delicious, with a decent number of prawns for a side dish served in a central London eaterie. The vegetable biryani was fine, comparable to what one might get in a decent local take out. the black dahl was surprisingly stingy with the lentils and had a taste that was slightly reminiscent of Heinz tomato soup (I kid you not). The biggest shocker (apart from the roti we ordered which came as a wafer thin bread that was impossible to scoop and eat with - I've eaten my fair share of roti and never seen anything like that) was Dishoom's Covent Garden Chef's Special, the Haleem, a 'revered dish that journeyed from Arabia to Hyderabad in the 19th century, and was there elevated to art form'. It was described on the menu as l lamb, cracked wheat, barley and lentils cooked for hours then pounded and served with a sesame onion seed naan and a garnish of green chillies, fresh ginger, fried onions and mint. What we got was greying mush that I have subsequently described to people (with no small degree of accuracy) as reminiscent of the nutrient goop that people have to eat in post-apocalyptic societies. It didn't really taste of much, particularly without the garnishes, and it was difficult to tell whether any animals were harmed in the making of this dish (if they were, it was an unworthy sacrifice). to top it off, the Bombay Pimms (\"The classic English quencher gone native with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, citrus and coriander. Fiery ginger beer, not lemonade\") I ordered tasted only of ginger beer, and not the fiery kind. Pleasant service and an exotic twist on the passing vogue for vintage interiors in no way make up for the crushing disappointment I experienced here. It's only the (slightly too noisy) ambience and the fact that the food wasn't bad so much as 'blah' that makes this a 2 rather than 1 star review. This is typical of the trend for taking cheap, tasty street food, prettifying it beyond all recognition (usually jettisoning taste at the same time) and then charging a bundle (the lamb goop was \u00a316!) for the privilege. thanks, but no thanks - I'll be sticking to the bustling environs of Tooting or Southall in future.",

    "text": "Best Indian food of my life. I don't even know where to start, but whatever, here I go. Found this place online and saw that it had really, really good reviews so I was intrigued. At first I tried to make a reservation on OpenTable but it was booked solid for the next WEEK so I took matters into my own hands and power walked to the place at 5:45pm on a Sunday. Even then, there was about a 20-person line out the door -- but it moved fast. After about 15 minutes in line, we got seats at the bar and I ordered a Bombay Colada, my sister ordered a virgin one, and my mom ordered a Gin Fizz. Prices were reasonable but on the expensive side -- BUTTT they were well worth their prices which is very rare. I watched the bartender as he made our drinks, and I kid you not, it was like watching a skilled artisan making artisanal goods. I was very impressed, and this was even before I had tasted my drink. It was AMAZING. So amazing that I didn't even care that there was practically zero alcohol content; it was all about the flavors. It was like the rum was just there to sweeten the drink. (I had a sip of my sister's virgin version and while it was good, it was lacking a little something-something, i.e. cane sugar via rum.)Just as we were finishing our drinks, as if it were clockwork, our table was ready. (SIDE NOTE: I haven't talked at all about the decor, but it was pretty great too. Super cozy and warm, but also quirky and modern with lots to look at. The main dining area is on the first floor where there is an open kitchen you can peak in to watch your food being prepared, and then the bar and additional seating is downstairs in the basement -- which one would think would be a bit more second-class, but it was NOT. In fact, I was kind of hoping for a table downstairs instead of upstairs because it just seemed so cozy and everyone looked so jolly.)Anyway, back to the food. Once we were seated at our table, we were greeted by our lovely server Praveen (sp?) who was friendly and welcoming, and extremely helpful in walking us through the menu. We ended up ordering vegetable samosas, Pau Bhaji, the house Chicken Tikka, Rajma-Chawal, house Black Daal, Roomali Roti, and some good ole garlic naan. Now I am going to spare you from my pathetic descriptions of these foods I can barely pronouce, but I will tell you this, everything was DELICIOUS. Everything. There was not one thing we ordered (we shared everything) that I did not like. Everything was the perfect amount of spicy, and all the flavors were rich and tasty. I'm Pavlov dogging right now just thinking about it. Ugh. I want to go back. Also, the food came out very quickly, and more or less all at once, which was awesome because I was starving.We ate a shit ton of food, and were certainly full, but the thought of skipping out on desert after enjoying every SINGLE thing we had ordered just seemed ludicrous. We did not want to miss out. Each of us got a Chai tea, and then we split a bowl of cinnamon ice cream (sooo rich and creamy) and a pistachio Kulfi -- I had no idea what the latter was, and still don't fully..., but it was so delicious/rich/creamy/yum. Kind of like a cross between ice cream and a popsicle (it comes on a stick). Idk.In conclusion, best indian food of my life. I miss it so much. And I will CERTAINLY be back each and every time I am in the UK. Will probably make a reservation next time though. PS, prices are very reasonable/affordable, staff is extremely hospitable, and the place is just not pretentious at all. Wide range of customers and EVERYONE seemed to be a happy camper/enjoying their dining experience.",

Showed up at the place and hostess informed me that a wait can be up to 50 minutes for 2 people. However if there's space at the bar, we can sit there first. The hostess was friendly and efficient and made you feel welcomed.So we waited about 20-30 minutes and we were able to get a table on the ground floor. We ordered the kebab, lamb chops, chicken curry, garlic naan, and rice to share. The wait staff was average, did their job and had no issues. The food were delicious and I would try other dishes the next time I visit! Would certainly visit again, however if I had to wait outside for 1+ hours in the cold, I wouldn't.

Ultimately, for me it doesn't matter how cool a restaurant looks if the food isn't up to snuff. I stopped in for lunch one day after reading all of the reviews. I just don't.. get it. We got the chicken tikka, the lamb with rice, and some garlic naan. It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but really not life-changing in my mind. It made me a little depressed to shell out the Central London premium when the bill came, knowing that there are better and cheaper alternatives in East London.Not a hater, but not exactly a fan either.

    "text": "Setup/Concept: 5/5Great interior space with the true feeling of an Indian cafe.With so many restaurants leaning towards a \"fancy atmosphere\", Dishoom does a great job with incorporating an above average dining room with a casual feel.Service: 5/5We received extremely attentive service from our waitress and she was also very informative when we asked for suggestions. Food: 4/5The food was above average in taste but could have had a bit more of a punch. I have been around Indian/Pakistani restaurants my entire life and feel that although not the most traditional food, Dishoom does a good job of gaining respect in its own way. The dishes are well thought out and executed with care. I have a habit of trying multiple things to try so we ordered: vegetable samosas, pau bhaji, lamb chops, ruby chicken, lamb biryani, naan, garlic naan, rumali roti, chai, fresh lemonade, green tea, mango lassi, khoya kulfi, mango kulfi, and the guju chocolate dessert. Overall:A must try if you are into Indian/Pakistan cuisine to give you a unique experience.",

Dishoom is located just off Leicester square in a trendy neighborhood full of restaurants. There was a wait for a table at 2pm, which I took as a good sign. Our waiter seemed to embrace the challenge of picking out appropriate dishes for first time Indian food eaters, and he did an excellent job overall. I'd say the prices were fair, I just wish we hadn't ordered quite so much food. It felt like a shame to let so much go to waste.",

I wasn't really hungry when I arrived, and wasn't that full when I left. Half point deduction. Full point deduction for the Chaijito (basically a mojito). For around \u00a38, I don't want a glass literally full of crushed ice - top to bottom. The spaces between the ice contained about 3 mouthfuls of so-so mojito with a generous amount of fresh mint. Very disappointing in that regard. Love the ambiance, enjoyed the food, disappointed in the value. Great to try, but I won't be back (except maybe to try my luck on the brunch).",

The biggest problem arose once we were seated. Our waiter was incredibly absent and negligent. When we asked for things... Like water... He didn't bring it, and every time he walked by, he didn't even check in to see if we needed anything. The only thing that saved our experience was another waiter, who really picked up where our waiter left off. The other waiter managed to handle all his tables, and bring us water, take our wine order, and check in regularly to see if we needed anything. At the end of the meal, I was more than happy to tip, but I strongly felt the tip belonged to the other waiter- not ours. Our waiter did nothing, he clearly had other tables he favored. I used to be a waitress in the service industry, and my belief is no one is entitled to a tip, you must earn it. So, I did not leave the \"optional service charge\" on my bill, and I instead gave the tip to the waiter who actually took care of our table.I was out the door of the restaurant, when our assigned waiter chased us down to confront us as to why we didn't leave the \"optional\" tip. I was shocked, and he followed up with the manager would like to know. I should have asked to speak to the manager, or just emphasized that the tip was OPTIONAL.... But instead I went through the reasons I did not leave a tip for him, and why I gave the tip to the person who actually took care of our us. I was just in such shock- I have never been chased out of a restaurant and interrogated as to why I did not leave a tip. \u00a0That waiter spent more time chasing me out, than he did at our table the whole night.I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, and if you get seated in a section with a good server, you will have a 5 star experience!",

We sat in the basement/\"bottom floor\" in a kind of alcove. We wanted to get grilled vegetables and fried calamari as starters, but the waiter said these items (which ARE labeled as \"starters\" in the menu) come out with all the other entrees. This system didn't really bother me but I just found it odd. For my main I got the murgh malai chicken. It was alright. I tried some sauces on my chicken; this was a bad move. Some of these table sauces were damn spicy. Not a refreshing, nasal-pasage-clearing spicy, just a prickly, why-is-this-sauce-like-this? unnecessary spicy. That kind of ruined the meal for me. The grilled veggies and calamari were fine but nothing to rave about.Everyone else seemed to like their dishes but nobody was like, \"Oh, man, this is so good, you've gotta try some!\" The server was fine but there were times I wished he availed himself to our table a bit more tenaciously. Prices are quite good, all main dishes under or around GBP 10. The decor and ambience were very nice, lots of Indian ephemera and dim lighting. I should note the gents' bathroom: it has huge urinals and an odd soap dispenser. Overall a slightly below average experience. I can see that most people really like this place so I would give it another shot, but if I'm picking out a restaurant this wouldn't be my top pick. Be your own judge, however, because sooner or later you're gonna have to stop listening to me and start making your own choices. And that soap dispenser was pretty weird, so maybe go just to check it out.",

    "text": "I took my sister and her Indian in-laws there and they loved it. What I think makes this Mumbai-inspired chain successful is that it's a subtle cross between East and West. The menu has all the classics you'd expect at your local deli; biryani, curries, kofta, naans etc. but the menu is designed to suit Western palates.I think it's a tad too pricey given the quantities but the \u00a0flavour and refinement make it worth the money. However, if you're looking for homely, comforting food, it's probably not the right place. The restaurant has a sophisticated and cosmopolitan vibe to it. If you go there in 5+ groups you'll get better value if you order different dishes everyone can eat from, tapas-style.",

Get down here early if you have party of less than 6, as you can't book a table for smaller group. We arrived at 6pm with a waiting time of 1 hour 20 minutes (wow!). Anywho, since this is our second attempt we agreed to wait and was let in to the bar downstairs. \u00a0Nice decoration and interesting cocktail and non alcohol list. I tried the rose and cardamom lassi n it is soooo good. We were offered a table at 7pm and was led to our table. Ordered few curry dishes, chicken ruby, cheese naan, garlic naan, briyani (chicken) and spicy lamb. All good especially the chicken ruby!! Tender n juicy. \u00a0Lamb in the hand was not good, as it was hard and dry (tip: need to review that recipe). Guzu mousse was my dessert but pieces of salt shaving on my mousse?? That's a bit unnecessary... and disturbed my palate. :) Oh well this restaurant definitely worth a try! Come early and enjoy the wait.",

We were in the queue waiting for our turns and they served us either Indian tea or mint drink which in itself a great hospitality that they start thinking about their customers even before they dine in with the restaurant. We were seated after 40-45 mins of wait. We orders everything in the world from chicken tikka, seekh kabab, chicken biryani, daal makhani, bhaang lassi, naan etc etc. I will say each and every cuisine is authentic. Ambience is full of Bollywood theme, staff is extremely courteous and soft spoken. The food is of par excellence and what else do you want from a place that provides you with great eating experience for dinner?Your $ or \u00a3 won't go waste here. Worth trying if you are traveling to London or living here.",

My favourites being calamari, Lamb boti, ruby chicken and roomali roti. I've had the coke float once, but was not available on the last 2 occasions I have been here, so that's the only disappointing thing about my trip, which is not bad. The customer service is amazing. They always put the customer 1st, which I believe is also why you'll always see people queuing some time for a table. On this trip, I did not make a reservation and queued I think half an hour and I had the opportunity to try the free chai offered. It was so delicious!!

After 30 minutes in line (6:30 pm on a Thursday), we got a table. Between the two of us, we shared the Paneer Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, Black House Daal, Paneer roll, and Mahi Tikka. Unfortunately, none of the dishes stood out in terms of flavor profile. Good, but not memorable. I expected the dark and deep flavors of the Black House Daal to mesmerize me, but it was served room temperature and more porridge-y. The Mahi in the Mahi Tikka was tender, but didn't contrast with anything, let alone the yogurt it was served with. I did get a lot of the charred, smoky flavor in the Paneer Tikka, but then again that was it. The Gunpowder potatoes were also disappointing. I didn't get the aroma from seeds or herbs at all. I really really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant. I think it must be the hype as well as the way all the dishes are described on the menu that makes you have higher expectations. Dishoom was just ok. I wouldn't return for the price.",

The food is amazing, and really that's all that really matters. For dinner I had the lamb awadhi biryani and its so rare to actually get a proper biryani anywhere.Roomali roti is another thing you can't get outside India very much, and their version is fantastic. But I actually really loved the breakfast. The kejriwal, chilli cheese toast with eggs was amazing. Also bun maska and chai in proper chai glasses. What more could you want? The lines do get seriously absurdly long. We arrived right at 5 and had no wait. And for breakfast since we had a group of over 6 we were able to make a reservation.It really is worth the hype.",

The cocktails were fabulous, and so is the decoration (those mirrors!!), the staff was lovely and pudding was quite wonderful, but the rest could simply have been better. It was mainly lacking the balance and complexity of flavour I was expecting from such a high reputation restaurant. ...

Just keep in mind Indian cuisine is insanely varied with very different style depending on the regions, Dishoom takes you to the old Irani Cafes of Bombay!! Everything about it takes you there - obviously the food and the smell but also the beautiful decor and the insane attention to detail! Staff has always been more than friendly. It's often very busy and requires queue but lovely touch as the staff offers you complimentary chai or mint tea whilst you wait. Let's start with a quick review of the breakfast menu - unfortunately for my liking breakfast menu at the weekend is only served until 11.45am... I mean seriously? That's not right! I tried to go couple times and failed! Successfully got there once at the weekend. However, I am lucky enough to work in media industry which means I have the privilege to take clients out and a Dishoom Breakfast is always a success! Love the bacon & egg naan bread - simple, basic but excellent. The Mango Lassi is to die for!! Absolutely delicious, not technically on the breakfast menu but it's not a problem for them. Before moving on to the lunch/dinner menu I do want to mention the cocktails! Oh my! Their Bombay Colada & the Edwina's affair are to die for! Amazing flavoursome twist to classics! Finally, the food... The Chicken Ruby is an absolute must. The Okra fries are genius. The sauces dishes are amazing to dip with your garlic or cheese naan! But even the less saucy dishes are cooked to perfection. Slight disappointment with the paneer roll to be honest. It was good but not extraordinary. I think it's more something to have on the go so perhaps doesn't work so well at a sit down dinner. I don't know, the flavours were there but just wasn't really working for me. Finally the puddings! That chocolate fondant with the chilli ice cream is great! Wobbles & melts in your plate and then your mouth, amazing combination with the ice cream. Otherwise you cannot go wrong with the kulfi on a stick!",

We'd heard a lot about how good the Indian food in London is and we were eager to try it for real. For tipples (acting British now lol), we got a pitcher of the Bombay Pimm's which was quite refreshing. For appetizers, we got a Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb and peas served with a toasted buttered pau bun). The keema was out of this world and tasted very similar to what it would back home. What joy in every bite!For the main course we went with the Chicken Ruby (recommended a lot on the other reviews) and the Haleem because it sounded delicious going by the description. The chicken ruby is a very tangy take on a traditional chicken makhani and the roomali roti is the perfect vehicle for scooping up the gravy. Slurp.We were so engrossed in eating that we forgot about the Haleem (a slow-cooked dish with lamb, wheat, barley, lentils and spices) which arrived a few minutes later. The Haleem which came with a side order of naan and extra condiments like fried onions, \u00a0chillies and lemon had a very good consistency and a rustic flavor that makes us drool every time we think about it.For dessert, our friends recommended the Memsahib's Mess (fresh cream with crushed meringue, strawberries, rose syrup and a rose petal preserve known as gulkand) which we demolished despite being full to the brim.Easily one of the most memorable Indian meals that we've had outside of India. Too bad it's not a stone's throw away :(",

It's chic, spacious, open and comfortable. Wafts of yummy smells also surround you as you sit waiting to order and eat. After looking at the menu, we had a hard time deciding so we decided to share the naan egg roll (around 5 pounds) and the granola with yogurt and fruit (5.60 pounds I think). Both were really good, especially the naan egg roll. This place is definitely underrated for breakfast!The naan had that perfect chewy, doughy consistency and the two fried eggs were still slightly runny. The tomato spread, cream cheese and sweet chutney perfectly complemented each other. The portion is cut into two pieces, and perfect for one person. The granola with yogurt was a little bit too sweet for our tastes, but it was still really good with vanilla yogurt, honey, fresh fruits (melon, pineapple, grapes, blueberries) and the contrasting texture of crunchy granola.We also ordered coffees (2.50 pounds for an iced Americano or latte). My Americano was probably the best coffee I've had since coming to England and so, so worth it. I definitely recommend this place for a quality breakfast at a reasonable price!!",

I made a reservation for Sunday afternoon. At around 3:45, there's already a line outside. They give you three sauces to dip: spicy, sweet and herbal. They both taste good by themselves. I tried the keema pau. The minced lamb with peas and the toasted buns are good. They really go well together. The children ruby is the best. Usually I like the Indian chicken dishes because of the sauce and not the chicken. Here the chicken really absorbs the sauce and tastes a lot better than the sauce. I also ordered the garlic naan. Even though they say it's made by hand and baked to order, it's good but not the best I've had. The service is good and the waitress gave me good recommendations.",

    "text": "Ok, I randomly picked this place because it has high reviews on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. But a lot of Indian restaurants have high ratings in London - so it truly was a random pick.This is why I was shocked that there was a line waiting out the door at 3 pm on a random Saturday!! It's all good though. We decided to wait and were seated within 30 minutes. Which was awesome. The staff was very friendly. I mean - VERY. I have nothing but positive things to say about the people working here.However, service was a bit slow. We showed up during a shift change and we kinda got lost in the shuffle with our waitress. But that being said, we took a while eating (one of the people dining with us has a condition that requires her to eat slowly) during a very busy time and not once did we feel rushed.But why 3 stars? Well - because honestly I truly don't understand the hype. Yes, the food was good - but it was nothing special beyond a regular Indian restaurant. I think there's a lot of hype about this place and I'm not really sure why. I hear they have an amazing breakfast and a few wonderful and unique dishes, so maybe that's what bumps the rating up to 4 or 5 stars?To me, it was a bit noisy and there were a few very odd dishes on the menu that don't scream \"Indian\" to me. Fried okra? But I guess it's all about what you're into. Everything we had was \"A-OK.\" Yes, I'd go back. But personally, I'd rather go someplace less touristy and less noisy.Not good for groups. Not good for children. Not good for romantic dining (since you won't be able to hear your date over the loud 40's music). But a cool experience.Oh, and prices are pretty reasonable - even with all the hype. Order the chai! Dishes we ordered:Mahi-Mahi Tikka Chicken BriyaniVegetable CurryBlack DhaalNaanVegetable Samosas",

    "text": "The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that there is going to be a 1.5-2 hour wait depending on what time you go, but it's well worth it! While waiting, the staff severs a chai tea to everyone in line that would like one. You stand in line for about an hour until you get through the door, but wait there's more! Once you step in you get a buzzer to hold on to, and they will notify you when your table is ready. This will take another 30-45 minutes. While waiting you can grab a drink at the bar and a snack. We started with the Dishoom IPA, a Bollybellini and Far Far. The beer was decent, Bollybellini was interesting and the Far Far was crispy, colorful and lemony. We were finally seated and excited to order. We looked to Yelp reviews for some assistance and already knew what we wanted by the time we were seated. We had the Prawn Koliwada, Chicken Tikka, Black Daal and Garlic Naan. The prawns were very flavorful with a tamarind chutney. Chicken Tikka was bomb, especially with the garlic naan. Black Daal was so rich and full of flavor and also great with the garlic naan. At night it is very low lit but very cool atmosphere. The server was helpful and very attentive and the bathrooms were quite interesting. I recommend this place to all my friends that visit London, I can't wait to go back and try other menu items!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner after spending a somewhat rainy day seeing the sights in Westminster and spending a little time avoiding said rain at the National Gallery. Living right next to the neighborhood for curry in NYC (dubbed 'Curry Hill' as a result), I wanted to check out how curry in the UK would compare. Getting a seat was easy enough, but unless it was a bad day, do not sit downstairs unless absolutely forced to. There's no natural lighting (which is depressing at 6 PM), but whatever was going on in the bathroom was infecting the aroma of the entire room. I don't like dining in places that smell like dank urine. After struggling to breathe for a few minutes, my girlfriend and I were able to get a seat upstairs. Much better, but a mark off for having a bar downstairs that smells worst than most dives.The food itself was alright, although I wasn't blown away, particularly at London prices. The lamb kebob was very flavorful, but the portions were a bit small (a recurrent theme with the dishes here). The dhaba chicken curry was good as well - the curry sauce was definitely more tomato-based (or vegetable-based) than the curries I'm used to, but it didn't leave much variety for the palette.Service was pretty standard for Britain, so all in all, it was an experience that came in a bit under expectations. Even with ordering an appetizer (I forget right off which one we ordered), the bill came out to 40 pounds - which is pretty damn expensive given the rather small amount of food we ordered. Considering I can score top-notch curry + rice for under $20 in the U.S., I'd give the upper hand to the neighborhood shops that are right across the block.",

No need to explain, you should just get this.Fresh Mint Tea - comes in a pot and has mint notes that seem to satisfy you immediately as you take deep breathes through the nose. Good subtle flavors for your morning wake me up.Food:Bombay Omelette - Pretty straight forward dish, omelette with a hint of spice together with onion and tomatoes. The side of vine tomatoes that are grilled are a very nice add when having the omelette and bread together. Fresh Fruit and Yoghurt - This is a surprisingly good dish. Simply put together with yoghurt and various fruits like raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and honeydew. The vanilla beans are visible on the yoghurt and add the great vanilla flavor along with the tart and sweet fruits.Bacon Naan Roll - ummmmm bacon... can't go wrong. That chili tomato jam with cream cheese is a nice combination. It's pretty sweet, but goes well with the salty, savory bacon wrapped up in the naan bread.Would love to come here for their dinner service, but so far has not gone wrong during breakfast.",

    "text": "Normally I am very skeptical of hip Indian restaurant. I eyed calamari on the menu, and automatically wondered what in god's name has globalization done to us. What self-respecting Indian restaurant serves Mediterranean/Italian fare? Man was I wrong. Hip or not, dishoom has amazing Indian food. Don't believe me? Eye up the clientele. The best way to figure out whether an Indian place is legit is to find older Indian patrons. If they are satisfied, then you sure as hell don't have any excuse not to be. Dishoom was bursting with Indians, and large portion of them were older :)For our food we ordered the Ruby Chicken, Kacchi Lamb Biryani with a side of Raita, and Roomali Roti. The Ruby Chicken was amazing. Perfectly complex, seasoned, and spicy. The biryani had prize pieces of Lamb. I am so used to getting sub par meat in Biryani, but the meat here was excellent. The raita was hands down the best I have ever had...creamy, thick, and cool. I only ordered one Roomli roti, but I honestly wish my own family could make roti as good as this one. All in all a wonderful meal and I can not wait to head back.",

    "text": "Ah, \u00a0Dishoom. How I have been waiting to eat your delectable creations. Finally, I had my chance.Upon walking up to Dishoom, my husband and I noticed a ridiculously long line. Unfortunately for groups less than six people, reservations are not possible - get here early and prepare to wait in line (a long time if you're unfortunate) to get inside. Those wishing the battle the wait can either go downstairs to the tiny bar and enjoy refreshments or be served complimentary goodies (like masala chai) while waiting in line outside for which I applaud them. Very good manners, Dishoom. Well played.Our line was supposed to be an hour long but as luck would have it, we waited less than 20 some minutes and were escorted inside to our table. The inside of Dishoom looks like what tea houses and cafes looked like in Bombay before they all started to disappear. Having gone to India in February, I was feeling nostalgic looking at all of the old Hindi film posters and black and white photographs. We were greeted immediately by our sever who asked us if we had ever eaten at Dishoom before. She guided us through the menu and suggested how we order - Dishoom is a small plates type of restaurant. It's best to order several items per person and share them. Dishes come out as soon as they're ready, so be prepared to receive items piping hot and in a random order. The cocktail list was interesting. Instead of ordering wine, we started with a Jack Daniels and Coke (for the husband) and a Bollybellini (for me). Opting to avoid our usual extravaganza of paneer dishes while eating out at an Indian restaurant, we ordered the pau bhaji, the house black daal, bowl of greens, rice, rajma frankie and gunowder potatoes. Everything was excellent - I don't need to go into the particularities of each dish. All I'll say is next time, I'll order a paneer dish, skip the greens and daal (although it's famous, I've had better. The pau bhaji was absolutely excellent (you can taste the butter) but more bread should be served with such a big portion. We each also sampled more cocktails - Edwina's Affair (or Edwina's something) and the Bombay Pimms and skipped dessert - we were far too stuffed to order more food, although we considered it more than once.Dinner was pricey but worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Everything was sparkling clean and the restaurant itself appears to run like a well-oiled machine. Downstairs in the bathroom, behind glass cases are very vintage looking Indian medicines to cure all sorts of remedies - a very interesting and thought-provoking display for those who have visited India. We will most definitely be back!",

Granted, my wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening at about 5:30, but still. Then again, the wait itself wasn't too awful. The line serpentined in front of the entrance and a lovely host greeted each party individually explaining the wait time (a MAX of 1 hour 10 minutes--which turned out to be a bit short of the actual wait) and asking if we had any questions. They also offered free lattes for anyone waiting.The total wait time involves three stages: wait outside, wait just inside the entrance, and wait downstairs at the bar. I don't know if this was making me more apprehensive or alleviating the wait time by creating a sense of \"we're moving along now!\"The food itself was great, albeit on the smaller side for dishes that should be shared. We ordered the chicken tikka (great chicken, though does NOT come with any sauce or curry), the Black House Daal (which offered some great moisture to the chicken), naan, rice, and vegetables. No issues with the food other than the fact that the waiter seemed surprised by what we were ordering. Not sure why.",

    "text": "Very cool Indian spot in Covent Garden! I heard a lot of good things about this place before I went but wasn't expecting it to be all nice and modern looking. Not really sure why, but I was thinking it was a hole in the wall and was completely thrown off when I came up on it. My large party was seated at one of the booths downstairs. We decided on ordering a whole bunch of different things and sharing it all and I highly recommend doing this so you can try as much as you possibly can. Some favorites I really enjoyed were the Dishoom Calamari, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, & Chicken Tikka were all great. Save some room for dessert and get the Kulfi or Cinnamon Ice Cream. Service was quick and the food comes out fast! Can't beat that!",

    "text": "There were six of us which afforded us the luxury of reserving a table in advance. But even calling a month ahead only got us a reservation at 18:00!Nevertheless, I digress. We were seated in the dark lower level. Nice low lighting for an intimate dinner but it made for difficult reading of the menu. We managed to order a wide selection of food which was all delicious. Highlights were the tender lambchops, calamari, gunpowder potatoes, cheese toasts and the briyanis. The chutneys were also very good. The service felt pushy. They told us they needed our table back in 2 hours which was fine but the meal felt very rushed. They had us in and out in less than an hour. We ordered some samosas which arrived while we were still placing our order since it was being relayed wirelessly back to the kitchen. \u00a0Really? They couldn't wait until the waitress left our table to start bringing food out? I also felt the waitress was trying to suggestively upsell us along the way - would you like a lassi? Maybe a saucier dish to go with your meal? A trip to the loo also meant being accosted by staff and being herded in the right direction rather than being politely asked if I needed help. \u00a0I relayed this all back to the manager via email who was apologetic about the experience.I really enjoyed the food but the experience was not relaxing as the service was too in your face. The Shoreditch branch does a much better job in the delicate balancing act of turning tables and delivering a good service experience. The food serves 4 stars but the service really brings it down to 3.",

Maybe it was dehydration from walking around all day, but nothing was better than mango lassi at that particular moment. Smooth, creamy, dare I say... mangoey? We tried a number of dishes, but the stand out was most certainly the grilled lamb chops. The flavor was on point - perfectly grilled and topped off with pomegranate seeds. The naan was warm and fluffy and the coleslaw served as a perfect cool down when necessary. I wouldn't have changed anything we ordered, except perhaps add on a tandoori chicken because I got major food envy looking at the table next to ours. I'd recommend making a reservation if possible, but if you end up waiting, you have to queue up outside. They come outside with drinks to keep you happy, but it looks a bit miserable especially if it's freezing cold outside.",

The mornings and odd times of day are the best as the rush for dinner is immense and often the wait can end up an expensive affair as you want to order all the delicious cocktails as your mouth waters in waiting for the amazing food. As a single diner you can get away with only having a veg dish and black dhal with bread and BOTTOMLESS CHAI (yessssss). The vegetarian options are terrific and there's plenty of shellfish/fish options for the not red meat eaters. But if you are an omnivore you are in for a treat. Honestly haven't had a bad dish and think I've tried all of them. Make sure to start with the bhel salad and go there with people who want to try different dishes as it's the best way to taste as many as possible.",

We had to remind them that it didn't come so that they could take it off the check. We ordered the rajma chawal for our kids so it came out first. When they delivered our food, they brought out a second rajma chawal which we didn't ask for. They took it back. A good concept of Indian street food in a refined setting.

So of course, the dice rolls and we leave with a wonderful meal on the house! \u00a0The owner and service staff were all great and made our last day in London memorable.",

The trademark black daal (\u00a34.90) and chicken ruby (\u00a38.20), neither of which shied away from flavor or spice, left me both full and wanting more. There was probably cocaine in both of them. I don't know that I care. These are mandatory for a first time order.The decor is neatly upscale and the staff was courteous to me as a solo diner in line with what one would expect based on the decor and the prices.There is only one significant downside to Dishoom: if it ever was a secret, the secret is out. Expect to wait. At 10:45pm on a Friday night for a solo diner I still waited 15 minutes. I walked by a few times and saw lines out the door. Be prepared.Dishoom, when are you expanding internationally? Please...?",

We must have been there 20 minutes and were then called to our table. We ordered a few tapas style plates having been told we should order two each to share but it was too much food. You may want to start with one each or a few and then continue. The food is like no other Indian food I've had in Los Angeles, both home cooked and at a restaurant. It is so flavorful, rich and unique. Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "The wait at this place was ONE HOUR!! They do give you small drinks while you wait (lemonade, sherry, chai), which is nice. The staff gets to you very quickly, which is nice. Ordered the Behl, which was strangely addicting. The Dahl was also very good. Spicy Lamb was good, but my chop was over cooked. Chicken Tikka roll was very amazing, but it's a wrap, not a roll. Chicken curry was also delicious. Roti was good, but I was craving naan a little more. Chicken tikka looked good, but as far as I could tell it was just grilled chicken (did not try). They don't ask if you want a dessert menu, which was nice and odd at the same time. I'm not used to restaurants doing that. The bathroom has an unnecessary amount of stairs (you walk up 2 stairs to get in and 1/2 the br is another 2 steps down... make it flat!!!). Overall good food, tho wait might not be worth it.",

While on line, they would serve you some hot chai milk tea to wait as we were there during the winter. The line actually moves pretty quick and in less than an hour, it was our turn. Once we enter the restaurant, there is another short wait down by the open bar but the wait there was also pretty short and we were then taken to our table. The curries were amazing! Although, I kind of wish I didn't order the mango dessert as it was just a Popsicle stick. I thought it would be something authentic that I can't get anywhere else, but it was still good nonetheless.",

The decor is thoughtful and intentional- it pulls through all of the fun and interesting things I saw growing up as an American Indian. All of the toiletries, movie references like the word Dishoom itself. It's a phrase like \"pow\" scene in superhero comics associated with a fighting scenes in Indian films. So it's fun, nostalgic and curious to be in the place. The food is also an elevated experience - the food options I'd say are classic choices - Phav Bhaji, Samosas, Matar paneer, etc. they taste really good though and have an extra pop. Drinks are great. I like their Bellini.",

It was long 45 min wait at 7pm but they were super nice and offered us hot Indian chai and sherry as we waited outside in the line. Once inside, we really liked the vibrant and clean ambience with lingering indian spices from across tables. We ordered Keema Pau, Vada Pau, Bhel and Pav Bhaji for starters. Loved envy dish since it was cooked to perfection without any excess oil. Went in big group with Europeans and Americans and everyone could eat it without compromising on their spice-level threshold. For the main course we ordered Chicken Ruby, Chicken biryani, Black daal, Roomali roti and Garlic naan. The biryani and dal were spot on. Wasn't too impressed with the ruby as it lacked the flavour and was bit bland. We wrapped out meal with kulfi and chai - hard to go wrong on these!Service was great, waiters were friendly and we got complimentary far far. It was a reasonably priced restaurant and didn't burn a hole with all the food that we ordered. Overall, great food and service.

We had a super friendly and helpful waitress called Maya, who made some interesting suggestions (Dishoom Chicken Tikka and Dishoom Calamari). The owners Amar and Shamil also welcomed us to the establishment and spoke to us about the design of the place / significance of the photos. They even had a replica of VT station's clock! (VT Station is the main railway station in Bombay based on the original St Pancras station.) Would recommend you trying the Grilled Masala Prawns, and the Ruby Murray (special of the day - meat and veg options available). We had the Chicken Newabi - a lovely coconut based curry with spices. Fragrant but not pungent.Yummy Lamb Biryani, just like the parents make - but beware as it is quite pungent for those who are not used to spices / heat. Also, soft garlic butter naans went down a treat. Save room for desserts!!! The chocolate fondant, and Malai and Mango Kulfis were gorgeous. The perfect way to end a meal. Went away happy with a full tummy. Friendly staff and a great place to relax if in the area. Will definitely be going back!!! :-)",

We were lucky enough to be invite to a pre-opening dry-run but you can sample their delights from Thursday - with the added bonus of 50% off during their first week. No reservations are required so get there early to avoid disappointment!!!! I can categorically say that this place will be full to bursting from the off... Dishoom advertises itself as a street cafe which are, according to my wiki research, sadly (if this restaurant is anything to go by) a dying breed. The menu is simple and varied enough without being overwhelmed with choice. The portions that come are small(ish) but don't be deceived, we only ordered a small dish and main each and were stuffed and barely touched dessert! There is an open kitchen so try and nab one of the popular booths in the bright and airy room upstairs; serving dishes such as chilli cheese toast and fish tikka, and main dishes including salads, roomali roti wraps and grilled kebabs. We were spoilt for choice with hot cumin laden lamb chops, a juicy mince meat keem pau spread on buttery bap, delicate flaky fish fingers which are perfect with the fragrant mint sauce, a hot! hot! byriani, and my favourite (and their signature dish) the melt in the mouth chicken tikka.. just beautiful. We were absolutely gutted when they accidentally sent us some prawns and then immediately took them back...they looked big and fat and juicy and the smell of coriander and lime..mmmmmm... oh well.. next time!!! Service was a bit haphazard, as you'd expect on a dry-run with frazzled nerves in the run up to an overdue opening. But it was smiley and our waitress and greeter were lovely and chatty and amazingly knowledgeable and helpful. The only supremely petty criticism I would have, and this is purely my own taste I should pint out, is that I wasn't a fan of the black daal; which tasted more like Heinz mulligatawny; I like my daal almost a warming slushy oniony, garlicky soup. And the chocolate fondant didn't sit so well with the rest of the menu though we all had ideas about how to make it more authentic: chilli said one, NO, cardamom said I. The waiter said that they were thinking of making it a chocolate and pistachio brownie.. mmm, that will go perfectly with the cinnamon ice-cream served alongside, which was just divine and I'm not especially a fan of ice-cream - it's not a real dessert to me, more of a fob-off. The gola ices were also lovely, the mango and ginger a perfect palate cleanser. Unfortunately we didn't try the chai or the cocktails, we were just too full of food and drink to even contemplate it, I'm leaving that for a revisit. They won't be waiting too long... like I said there's 50% off the first week AND they open for breakfast. oh woe is my wallet!",

    "text": "I went here with my son on a bank holiday Friday at lunch time, so it was rather quiet at first. It started to fill up as we were leaving however, mainly with large groups of tourists. My son had been here before one weekday evening and couldn't get in. He was told there was a 90 minute wait and a minimum order of \u00a325 per person.The staff were friendly and attentive. Maybe too quick to get your order though; I hadn't even got my menu open and the waiter was asking what we wanted.The d\u00e9cor and atmosphere were really nice. I liked all the little Indian touches you'd not usually see in an Indian restaurant. Such as the sign by the door explaining the rules, very funny. I also liked the lighting, up turned brandy glasses with the stem cut off hanging from chains.Some of the kitchen equipment wasn't working so there were items we couldn't order. We both opted for the Keema Frankie, a spiced minced lamb wrap at \u00a36.90. It was a good size, very mild but flavoursome. A good choice. I then had the Gunpowder Potatoes. Shallow fried fluffy potatoes gently seasoned with herbs and spices and chopped spring onions at \u00a35.50. The portion was enough for two to share and was very moreish.My son had the the Pau Bhaji. A dish of mashed vegetables with a buttered pau bun at \u00a33.90. It was fresh, light and delicious and again enough for two to share. He followed this with a Bombay Floater. Chocolate ice-cream floating in a tall glass of thums up (cola). Thums up is an Indian cola made by the coca cola company and is quite different from normal coke. Great stuff at \u00a33.70. I chose the Green Darjeeling Tea at \u00a32.20 a pot. This was really lovely and a great end to the meal. The pot was huge but only filled with enough water for three full cups. It was very refreshing though. To round it off we had a Malai Kulfi \u00a32.90, small but good with a caramel taste and a Pineapple and black pepper crumble which was said to be very good at \u00a35.20. Total for the meal: \u00a341.85I did like this place and would certainly go back again soon. I would have given more points, but I didn't because you couldn't choose how hot or mild you wanted each dish and the tables were so close to each other you felt like you were wedged between the tables with no room to move. It also irritated me that people were using chairs for their lap tops. Once we'd paid the bill the staff tended to ignore you and didn't reply when we said 'Goodbye'.What I did like was the food, it was not the usual Indian fayre dished up in most restaurants and that made a big difference to me. The menu felt like a sheet from a newspaper which liked too. There were other dishes that caught my eye too, that's why I'd like to go back.",

    "text": "After a week of eating boring, giant group dinners with co-workers on a work trip to London, Dishoom was a most delightful change of place. In Leicester Square, it's walkable from lots of places. The space itself is gorgeous: dark, lacquered wood, an open kitchen, and lots of shiny sparkly lights to make you feel warm and cozy. The downstairs area is enormous, so tables are pretty readily available. We went for 'girls night' -- and Dishoom is perfect for that. It is, in essence, Indian tapas. Our server gave us a quick rundown of the menu and suggested some good options for sharing. She also forewarned us that the food comes to your table as it comes out of the kitchen (pretty standard for tapas and worked out just fine, as a steady stream of dishes arrived throughout our dining experience). Food highlights: the Grilled Masala Prawns had amazing smoke and spice flavor; all of the Biryanis we had were incredibly tasty and, in a few cases, pretty spicy. I'd definitely recommend a side of raita to cool things down. And, of course, the naan was delightful. When isn't naan delightful? Desserts were super yummy, most notably the cinnamon ice cream.The only real food lowlight: the vegetable samosas were oddly bland and mushy. They also are not made on-site, as we learned when we asked if they included nuts for one of our friends with a nut allergy. The server and kitchen said they could not confirm, as they don't actually make them there. Curious. [The menu does, by the way, include an indicator of which items have nuts and which are veg, which is helpful if you have a group where some folks have dietary limitations.]Service was oddly hit and miss. When we started, our server was thoroughly attentiive. By the end, I actually had to get up and pick up our glasses of wine from the bar (which we had seen sitting there, lonely, for about 15 minutes). The bartender apologized profusely and was clearly more bent about it than we were. :)Overall, I'd go back in a heartbeat. The warm room, the yummy and wide-ranging food options, and the overall festive nature of the place makes up for whatever shortcomings we may have noticed in our visit. When we finished, we rolled out into the cold after our meal -- just the perfect level of full and pleasantly lit, with big smiles. It's definitely worth giving Dishoom a go.",

Promoted as a 'Bombay Cafe' \u00a0but far more stylish a setting than the image that conjures up, we were ushered into our little 'cavern' downstairs and given a Bombay Pimms \u00a0pimms, saffron gin, ginger beer and coriander. I love Pimms and was slightly dubious as to how this would taste,, but I can assure it more than worked \u00a0it was fabulousand kicked our evening off to a great start.The head chef then came out to explain what we would be eating \u00a0a selection of dishes from their 'small plates' offer. Think Indian tapas and you will have hit the nail on the head.We had keema pau, skate cheeks koliwada and bhel \u00a0a zesty and fresh puffed rice salad with pomegranate. The keema pau was the star of the show, rich and full of flavour \u00a0only lightly spiced. But the skate cheeks were also gorgeous \u00a0tender and moist with a slightly spicy batter.Unfortunately we didn't get much time at Dishoom as we had to rush off to the next location of our 'crawl',, but what we had definitely made me thirsty (and hungry) for more \u00a0so I wil be retrning!",

Loud, casual ambiance with both table and booth seating. Looking around, you can see the naan being made fresh behind the counter.For drinks we ordered the house chai and mint tea. The chai was the best chai I've ever had. Rich, spicy, and soothing, the (sadly) small glass of chai was an excellent way to start the morning. The mint tea could be smelled from a mile away, that's how fresh and refreshing the mint was.We ordered the bacon naan, akuri, the big Bombay, and the kejriwal, which was eggs on chili cheese toast. The bacon naan was superb. The tamarind BBQ sauce complemented the bacon extremely well. The Kejriwal was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and the flavors didn't meld too well together. I'd rather have had a second naan. The other people in my group enjoyed the Akuri and The Big Bombay, especially commenting on the taste of mushrooms. If I could give half-stars, this place would get 4.5/5. Not perfect, but pretty darn close.",

    "text": "Came to this place with a couple friends for dinner. They had us sampling chai tea and lemonade while we were waiting in line. The line moved pretty quick and before we know it we were seated. We waited about 45mins which wasn't bad. We ordered 4 entrees for the 4 of us. We also ordered 2 sides which were bowl of greens and basmati rice. All dishes were amazing and it was an awesome experience. Most of their dishes are dry and not saucey like other Indian places I've been to in the past. We were all stuffed and super satisfied with the service and food. Definitely a great place for romantic dinners with the dark atmosphere inside. Even though we were full, we still wanted to order more. It was impossible to stop talking about it after we left the restaurant. Garlic Naan: Oh my god! The garlic naan was perfect with the chicken ruby we ordered. The naan itself was just as amazing. It had just enough garlic and butter on there to make it super flaky and good. Mahi Tikka: Hands down best dish of the night! There were 4 big pieces of fish which was perfect for each of us to try one. The fish was super fresh and amazingly good. It pretty much melted in my mouth after taking one bite of it. I've never seen fish at an Indian restaurant before, but man this was literally hands down best dish ever! I almost wanted to order another one. Chicken Ruby: This was really really good. It was the red tomato sauce with chicken in it. There were big chunks of chicken in there which were super tender. I ordered some rice and ate it with the sauce. The sauce wasn't super overpowering the chicken or over spiced at all. I'm super picky with my sauce, but this was really good to the point that I would be able to drink it just by itself. Dishoom Chicken Tikka: This was probably one of their signature dishes. The chicken thighs were super juicy and smooth. They definitely didn't over cook the chicken.I will definitely come back when I visit London again.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here during our last night in London because it had a good Yelp rating along with the other parameters we used. I thought the food was great and normally the pros and cons of the place would have evened out to a 4 star experience, but the waiter we had was so bad that the meal ultimately ruined what would have otherwise been a pleasant end to our U.K. vacation. Frankly I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I'm restraining myself out of a greater sense of fairness and keeping it at 3 because I think overall this place is well managed and I can't justify dropping it lower mainly because of one waiter with a bad attitude. Thus, at the end of the day we sort of got what we paid for (3 stars), but it's not a place I'd really want to go back to or even recommend for others to try (3 stars).When we first arrived we reached the back of a line outside the door and the staff did a great job of managing our expectations re: wait time and I thought it was really nice that at one point one of the waiters actually came outside with complementary tea for all of us. One of the people in line with us talked about how one of his friends always wants to come to this place whenever he visits London and I really liked how we could see what people were doing in the kitchen.Then we got in and we had this waiter who seemed nice, but after the first glasses of water he never refilled them for us after being asked more than once. Thank God the food wasn't too spicy -- otherwise, we would have been in trouble! And he did that thing that too many waiters do where they hold you hostage with your bill and you have to flag them down, and this was getting pretty late on a Sunday night. Overall it gave us the impression that he just had this attitude of oh, these people are just American tourists, they'll never be back so forget about them. Adding insult to injury our bill had something called \"voluntary\" [tip/gratuity] instead of just charging an honest price for each of the items and managing our expectations instead of making us think oh wow, these prices are actually reasonable despite being in the heart of London.Negatives:-really small portion sizes -- this was to be expected and considering the prime location would not have been an issue if other basic things had been up to par-no complementary rice -- this is more of a critique of U.K. Indian restaurants in general, but really? It costs almost nothing to make rice and an Indian restaurant without free rice is like a Mexican restaurant without free chips & salsaPositive things:-Excellent fresh taste, about as good as one could expect of Indian food (psst! There's also a great Indian restaurant in Salisbury near Queen Elizabeth's Park that's even better. My experience in the U.K. is that restaurants in outlying areas are better in addition to being more economical and in London you're better off just going to one of the big grocery stores)-Great atmosphere, no complaints there-From a cultural standpoint I liked that they offered Iranian items -- the lamb was quite good",

It was only later that I'd notice that Ruggy and other Yelp dignitaries had experienced the majesty of this modern Indian tapas hangout slinging traditional street flavors.Being jetlagged and coming here at 4:30 pm probably helped my cause of getting in without much fuss. The wait was about 5 minutes and only the arrival of my East India Gimlet and lamb samosas were able to drown out the guilt I felt over snagging a three-person table by myself.Before I was seated, I waited at the bar downstairs and had time to admire the cavernous layout and dimly lit rooms, surprisingly sexy and mysterious compared to the Indian restaurants I've experienced in New York.I ordered up the items I understood to be standouts here, and they didn't disappoint. In addition to the aforementioned lamb samosas, the house black daal and chicken ruby curry were both out-of-this-planet good. I mean, plate-licking good stuff. Make sure you don't miss either dish.Looking forward to a return visit on my next trip to London. Come at off-peak hours and order up a bunch of stuff. This is a place for sharing, yours truly notwithstanding.",

My advice, DO NOT DO THAT! This place is crazy busy and the wait time was well over an hour on a Friday evening after 6P. I stood there for awhile contemplating weather or not I thought I'd make it in and have enough time to enjoy dinner before realizing it just was not going to happen. I asked the host what time they close and if they are this busy after theatre. He mentioned there would be a wait later in the evening before they close but it wouldn't be this long at all. I decided then I'd hop out of the line and go to theatre hungry. I came back at around 1015P and waited for around 20 minutes and enjoyed the best dinner. All of my usual, very basic (I know) menu items: somosas, Ruby Chicken, Rice, Cheese Naan, a beer and their delish warm chai tea they pass out to the folks waiting outside in the cold for a table.Service was friendly, food arrived quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour.I'd definitely recommend dining here but planning it out accordingly since no one really enjoys waiting long periods of time to eat.",

We're so used to hitting up the cheap all you can eat Indian buffets..that Dishoom atmosphere, presentation, and selection just blew me out of the water. There will always be a wait here... but the hostess stand makes up for it by serving hot chai and mint tea to those who are in line! Tasty as well. Took about 35 minutes to be seated so I was starved. We started out with cocktails, the bf and bro got the house beer while I gotta chilitini, spicccay but really all the drinks were very unique and delicious sounding... wish I wasn't a broke med student. We didn't want to eat too much but did anyways. Started out with the okra fries.. so crispy. The got the pav bhaji, Dishoom chicken tikka, and chole puri. The most flavorful was the chicken, very tender pieces and creamy curry. It was a little different, they put a lot of lime juice \u00a0in the chicken tikka .. was s different spin I've never seen before, but very tasty. I think the chole was the most underwhelming, couldn't compared to the chicken. Pav bhaji was flavorful as well but messy. Dessert we shared a malai kulfi, yum... a sweet end to a very filling meal.Expensive? Yeah but what isn't in Europe? Don't go here if price is an issue. But... you'd be missing out honestly, it's definitely worth the experience even if it's a one time thing.",

They are definitely prepped for the amount of people they get each day, though! If you come for dinner, they'll have hot tea for you while you wait in line. Around twenty minutes into the line, they'll take you inside to the bar area where you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait for a table to clear up. Once you have a table, you can go and order all of the food that you want.I'm a huge fan of their ruby chicken, garlic naan, and Dishoom chicken tikka. Also, the potatoes that they serve are fantastic. I ordered a drink at the bar - it was a chai-infused apple cider, but it was a bit of a miss for me (and a little on the pricey side \u00a36.50 a bottle).Overall, come here if you want some great Indian food in the heart of London - if you can deal with the wait, it'll definitely be worth your while!",

The lamb was delicious. The Dahl was good but the naan was a little too crispy. The lamb samosas were my favorite dish of the evening, but you only get 3 of them...lame. The place was super busy, so I didn't feel like we got a super friendly/helpful waiter. Overall, I would eat here again, but only if I didn't have to wait in line for an hour. I'm sure there better places in London for Indian that don't have such a wait.",

    "text": "There aren't many times when you wake-up (in London), stretch, call your local friend about where to go for breakfast and they say - \"How about this Indian joint?\"Huh?Yeah, my thoughts exactly! I'm all for Lamb Vindaloo kicked up to to a level 10 on the Indian spice scale or a Naan dredged in Butter chicken sauce so deep that you can't tell where the BC begins and the Naan ends! But before 11am? I danno guys...And then there was Dishoom, Sweet merciful gods of Indian cuisine, what the WHAT!So basically, the geniuses in the kitchen here have taken traditional english breakfast faves, slapped it upside the bread with some Indian spice, and boom - everything is nice. End of story. I didn't think this would be possible, call me a doubting Thomas, but I needed proof, and safe to say I got some.To begin, I opted out of my normal breakfast coffee for a House Chai (or 4) @ \u00a32.50, I was gulping this stuff by the gallon and better than tea, better than coffee, better than freshly squeezed OJ, this made my stomach oh so happy and calm after a few days of adjusting to British fare and a long flight.Following my chai time, I didn't give my stomach too much of a break and went with the Kejriwal which is two fried eggs on chilli cheese toast. As described in the menu as \"A favourite of the well-to-do Willingdon Club, the first such Bombay institution to admit natives; the dish is reputedly named for the member who kept asking for it. (Not to be confused with Arvind Kejriwal, leader of India's Aam Aadmi - common man's - political party.)\" - \u00a34.90History lesson aside, this was a beautifully flavourful meal, part normal breakfast that I'm used to and part \"kick-it up a notch, Indian HELLO\" (waves excitedly).I was so impressed, and breakfast is a hard meal to impress me with - rest assured I'll be back when I'm in the UK again! Pro-tip: The Breakkie/Brunch crowd starts to queue up around 10/10:30am so make a reso or get there earlyEatcrest Out!",

Everything that we had (Chicken tikka, lamb, samosa, calamari, etc.) was delicious. I cannot have dairy and it was wonderful that there was a dairy-free menu. For items that were prepared to be dairy free (i.e., no butter used), I appreciated that there were \"allergy\" markers on the food. I can't tell you what a relief it was to eat a meal at a restaurant without being terrified that I would have a reaction. \u00a0On each of our 3 visits, everyone we encountered, from the people at the door, to the hostess, to the bartenders, to the wait staff, was friendly and helpful.As others have warned, it does get busy. If you make it there before 5:30pm, there isn't much of a wait. \u00a0After that, expect to wait. \u00a0One night, we got there about an hour before they closed, and we still had to wait 30 minutes. \u00a0I was told that during their busiest time, you can expect to wait at least 2 hours. \u00a0It is worth the wait though.",

They do offer a small drink while you wait outside and once you're inside they take you downstairs where the bar is located where you can order a cocktail or two while waiting for a few more minutes for your table. Food plates are enough to share with 1-2 more people or if you're not sure just ask the server. The Chicken Rubi was our favorite and for dessert I loove the Memsahib's Mess pudding which is strawberries and crumbled meringue in whipped cream - so light and hits the right spot to finish off the delicious meal.",

Pau Bhaji: Tasty vegetable mash. \u00a0I wouldn't say this is a must order but it was definitely solid. \u00a0 Prawn Koliwada: I like they way the spicyness and flavor are really exploding in your mouth. \u00a0This were some tasty prawns. \u00a0The prawns were small though...Spicy Lamb Chops: This dish was good as well but not a must order. \u00a0I wish it would have had more of a sear on it, but the flavors were there.Chicken Ruby: Probably my favorite dish of the night. \u00a0The chicken is cooked in a makhani sauce, which is basically Tikka masala with more emphasis on a tomato-cream base. \u00a0Mouth watering deliciousness here.Lamb Boti Kabob: These were good and had a nice marinade of chilli and ginger.Garlic Naan: This was good, but you'll probably want to put in 2 orders, unless you ordered as much food as I did for 2 people. \u00a0Don't miss this place as the flavors here are quite different than what you can find in the States. \u00a05 stars.",

That's not to say it's not a tasty place with a fun ambience but I never go here unless guests are in town who request it, or if I so happen to be in the neighbourhood with time to kill. It's a fairly well oiled machine of the queue line w drinks while you wait, to the drinks bar area, to finally being sat and served. Menu changes with some frequency but I would suggest, if available the Chili Cheese Toast - exactly like it sounds, solid entree choiceChicken Tikka - a 'classic' dish for the less ambitious and whitewashed, but still yummy Lamb Raan Bun (except without the bread) - like a shredded lamb on the bone, this was by far the star. So flavorful and filling.Blach House Daal (lentils) - It's slight more refined spaghetti-o sauce with lentils. I wouldn't order itGarlic Naan - yum, always yum",

First impression is that it's a bit more Westernized (and full of white people) than the places I usually frequent. Open mind nonetheless!All I can say is the veggie samosas are among the best I've encountered. Flaky, potato-y, peppery, hearty, and perfectly spiced. Wow. Pairs like a champ with the tamarind chutney. And def go for the veggie version -- the lamb simply doesn't work as well.Ordered the chefs special Haleem, which arrived at the table surprisingly quickly. Creamy lentil base offered some contrast with the spice-rich additions, yet the depth simply wasn't there. And I found the plain naan a superior match to the included poppy-onion naan. Solid, yet unremarkable overall. And certainly not worth \u00a316.50.Going with 3* here since 3.5 isn't available and I suspect this place is overrated. Based on my limited (read: singular) experience, I'd venture elsewhere for truly great Indian cuisine. But if you're in the area, pop in for an order or two of veggie simosas: you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi caf\u00e9s. If you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff.I'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic).Truthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :)I'd be surprised if it comes to more than \u00a330pp :)",

They have an efficient system by which to handle the steady flow of customers that contributes to the experience & atmosphere rather than detract. Service is very friendly... especially for the location / reputation. Prices are downright good for the location. Menu is limited in a way that suggests that they are more interested in making good dishes than in pleasing all.",

By the time we left an hour later the restaurant was full and a solid line outside. Good service with attentive staff & willing to share open insights into menu. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. Okra fries. Lamb samosas. Wanted to try their version of chickentikka but one member of our party wasn't keen on spicy dishes & the waitress was able to help us head this off. Murgh malai & masala prawns were splendid, the char on the prawns particularly excellent. But stand out was the Ruby Chicken, a curry with melt in your mouth chicken. I also treated myself to one of their cocktails, the Bombay Pimms & can heartily recommend. \u00a325 a head seemed reasonable for the range of dishes. And excellent service in what was becoming a very busy room. Look like a chain across London. Recommend a visit",

    "text": "It took two attempts before we could grab a table. Dishoom does not accept reservations unless for parties of 6 or more. Your best bet is to arrive before 6pm to get a table, otherwise, it is an average of an hour for a table. There is a small bar section downstairs while you wait for a table. The vibe here is full of energy! Pimms lemonade and lukosowa cocktail was the poison of the evening -- they were very refreshing for the spicy food that was to come. For London, the price on the cocktail was rather reasonable.For the food, we decided to do a tasting sample. Be sure you ask for the heat index, we didn't and got ourselves into a pinch half way through dinner. The dome oven was broken, so that was a bummer. Most dishes are appetizer size, so you'll need about 2- 3 dishes per person. But, don't let the waiter influence your decision, order as you go along.Garlic Naan: crispy and packed with garlic, you almost don't taste the bread. It's a garlic lover's dream come true!Bhel: we were a little surprised by this rice cracker dish which has the texture of rice crispy cereal providing for a neat texture. Don't be fooled by the berries, you'll gonna need that sweetness once the heat hits - it gets you at the back of your throat.Chicken Berry Biryani: curry chicken, slow cooked, served over rice and a full serving. This was a great medium heat dish.Vada Pau: spiced potato and chutney in a bun. Two buns per order. One bit per bun. Dhaba Chicken: curry chicken that was a bit too spicy, a rather small serving.Mago & Fennel Lassi: cold refreshing drink to help cool your mouth. \u00a0This is yogurt based. Half way through the meal, my mouth was on fire. \u00a0Another waitress saw me starting to swell up as I tried in vain to wave cool air into my mouth. He brought over Raita, a cool cucumber yogurt sauce, on the house. It was a really nice gesture and did the trick. Shortly after, the house manager came by and asked if we needed any more bread, also on the house. \u00a0I was too embarrassed to say yes - however, very appreciative of their service.",

The waiter recommended the prawn Koliwada starter. It was heavy and flavorless. Lamb Awadhi biryani had literally no flavor. The kachumber was an insult to the name; instead of finely chopped cukes, tomatos, and onions with some spice and lemon, it was literally a bowl of giant pieces of unseasoned raw red onion with a few bits of tomato and cucumber thrown in. Inedible and gross. The signature prawn moilee curry was just OK, but given that it tasted a bit like something, it was the standout of the meal. All this, and the prices are quite high. Twenty pounds a head for lunch will buy you lovely Indian food at about a thousand places in London.",

And only \u00a34.95/order. I could happily sit down with a pot of that and some naan and gorge myself any day of the week.They also have a breakfast/brunch service, which I have yet to try.

    "text": "this was me and Justin B's first meal on our London vacay and we definitely got our trip off to a great start by having dinner at Dishoom! it's located right in the middle of all the convent garden shops and restaurants. we showed up early at like 530pm on a friday night and there was already a queue for an hour wait! we figured that this place had to be good so we waited outside patiently as a queue formed behind us. they have such an organized line system - first wait outside, then sit inside as waiting areas open up, then transition downstairs to the bar as space opens up there so an hour wait isn't that painful.we ordered a couple of cocktails and a calamari appetizer in the bar area to wet our appetite and then we were seated for dinner in the downstairs dining room. everything on the dinner menu sounded so good so we ordered a little bit of everything haha. the dishoom chicken tikka was so good and the meat had such a nice grilled flavor to it! the chicken ruby curry was super flavorful and rich! the only miss for me was the kacchi lamb biryani only b/c it was a bit too spicy for me...and the black house daal (lentils) was probably my favorite dish of the night! of course we ordered garlic naan to sop up all the extra sauce for the dishes too. sooo much food but it was soo good! probably the best Indian food that i've ever had. this place definitely isnt cheap since all the dishes add up fast, but its worth the splurge!",

The wait for a table was long, 40 mins at the bar and finally we got a table. The service was efficient and the food was ok, not really Indian, more 'irani cafe in Bombay indian', or what people think indian is?. I did enjoy the entire dining experience but that is what its all about, the experience , not just the food or drink",

I had the mahi tikka which was tender and moist along with the cheesy naan and a mango lassi that was very refreshing. \u00a0We also ordered raita for the table which was a pretty large side and refreshing with the curries. My friends had the black daal and the chicken ruby and they loved both as well. I also was able to try my friend's rose and cardamom last and it was delicious. The service was great and they let us sit at the table as we waited for our other friends to arrive instead of giving up the reservation. I recommend going at lunch to beat the crowd and cannot wait to return and try many of the other dishes on their menu.",

    "text": "The queuing is unreal at the Kings Cross branch. It would make a lot of sense if they took bookings as the queue often engulfs the pavement and annoys the locals (incl me) by making them walk in the road. They have queue management staff but they are busy telling ppl it will be a 2hr wait and giving them tiny drinks to stop them from leaving. Other grumbles include excessive use of incense which can make you heave while eating, high prices, small portions and the strangeness that no one who works there seems to be asian (well, visible staff). That shouldn't make any difference but it kind of puts you off your food wondering if this is the only place in the world where indians are being served indian food by italians and poles. There is nothing wrong with that, its just so bizarre!Those aside, the food is really tasty. I've tried a lot of indian food here and in india and they have really nailed the recipes. I would probably be a regular it wasn't in such high demand.",

The food was excellent unlike so many of the Indian restaurants in the US each entree had a distinct and unique taste. Very fresh with a large array of choices.

    "text": "Oh my. I'm so happy I was introduced to Dishoom on my visit to London. There was definitely a pretty long wait (a bit over an hour) but I think it was very worth it. When you arrive you put down your name and at least one person per table has to stay and wait in line. While waiting in line, you will be offered a hot chai or water (definitely take them up on the offer! Especially if it is cold out!). Once you get to the front of the line, you'll be handed a buzzer and taken to the bar where you can order drinks while waiting for your table. Before you know it, your buzzer will go off and you'll be taken to your table to begin your amazing dinner. We ordered the chicken ruby, black dhal, spicy lamb chops, paneer, lamb biryani, naan (x3), and a bowl of greens. Everything was so delicious and my table of 4 finished off just about everything. I definitely wish some of the items on our table were a bit spicier (I LOVE my spice and was craving some heat) but overall, everything was great and I'll definitely be back to try some more items on the menu. However, I'll definitely be back for the biryani and the black dhal!",

    "text": "A few friends who recently visited London had great things to say about Dishoom. Mainly, it being a local, swanky, fun, loud, \u00a0delicious time. So immediately after landing and putting the luggage away, this place came to mind for dinner. Awesome introduction to London. Technically, Dishoom is \"Indian food,\" but it's also a a neo-fusion of culture and taste. Auspiciously, everything on the menu is a good choice. The host may attempt to recommend you get three entr\u00e9es a person--my girlfriend and I ordered plenty after getting two or three entr\u00e9es (altogether, not each) with rice and naan.The food was so good!! Had we gotten another entr\u00e9e or two, I definitely would've eaten it I would have fallen into a food coma immediately after.The music in the background is great, some sort of blend between 1920 jazz, and swanky dance music. The wait is generally 30 minutes to an hour, but you can generally find a spot at the bar to grab a drink while you wait. If you're starving there's also generally two or three snacks at the bar you can purchase. For example, my girlfriend and I ordered vegetable samosas. Soooo good! Crispy light crunchy on the outside, nice veggie-mush on the inside.Definitely not cheap, but not annoyingly expensive. I think the price is just right. Well, there are a few outliers that are more expensive. But the median price ranged from \u00a39-15\u00a3. So, more than I would normally pay at a pub, but also a very nice dinner. Would definitely go again if I were to visit London. You can wear whatever you want to dinner, but I would generally go with smart-casual-- A reasonably nice shirt and a reasonably nice pair of jeans at least. The staff was wonderful. We got pushed out the door a little quickly but it was in a very polite way given we were literally the last customer of the night (we arrived about an hour before closing). So instead of, for example, being offered a dessert menu after the meal, we were brought the dessert menu and asked if we would like to close out now or after dessert. Or as we looked over the main entr\u00e9e menu, the host would comment we only had about 10 minutes to choose ab order before for the kitchen would be interrupted from it's closing process. That was annoying. I kind of understood... but at the same time, we did arrive an hour before closing, not five minutes before closing. And empathy aside, we did spend a combined \u00a340-\u00a350 (including drinks). So as polite and eloquent as the host was, \u00a0the pressure (at the very least) did not add to the experience.",

Tender chicken in a rich silky curry sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. 10.50-PANEER TIKKA: Paneer is vegetarian first-class fare and a subtle cheese to make. Marinated then gently charred with red and green bell peppers. Not worth trying again, because there are so many other delicious things on the menu. 8.20-HOUSE BLACK DAAL: Dishoom signature dish -- it is like a dark, rich, deeply flavoured lentil textured dish in a rich subtle sauce. You can tell It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. 6.20-JACKFRUIT BIRYANIDelicious, savoury jackfruit and delicately saffron'd rice, potted and cooked with mint, coriander and sultanas. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. So much flavor and was expertly executes. 9.5-GARLIC NAANWith minced garlic and coriander sprinkle. It is one naan cut in half. Get more than one serving per person, you won't regret it. Dip into anything, including their delicious chutneys. 3.20",

Then, they led us to the bar where we waited another 30 minutes to get our table.Food: I was very lucky to go with an Indian food expert where she made all the orders for us. Very delicious! I love their vegetarian options as well!Service: Quite slow, but I understand because it's a Friday night so they were very busy. Our waiter kept disappearing when we needed him. Other waiters were helpful when we needed help.Tip: Free wifi!",

Probably my favorite dish. Pau Bhaji was amazing! If you don't like to share food then I'd order 2 of these dishes then proceed to eat them both. House black Daal is a must. Eat it up with their garlic naan at your own risk because you won't want to stop eating. They may have to roll you out the front door after you pay. Bad: Nothing",

I was just so amazed at how organized this waiting process was. While you're waiting in line, they bring out samples of chai tea for you to enjoy! We waited around an hour outside. When we got to the front of the line outside, they take you inside downstairs with a buzzer to their bar to wait some more. When we got downstairs somebody greeted us right away \"Christine?\" and took us to our spot at the bar. There is free wifi while you wait too. Wow! Then a very friendly server came to ask if we wanted any drinks. We were seated at our table not too long after.-Pau Bhaji: Must get!!!! This was my favorite dish here. Ordered it not really knowing what it was but got it because everyone else raved about it, and it's amazing! Especially with the hot bun it comes with....ahh-Garlic naan: really good as well. Especially with the chicken ruby sauce/pau bhaji -Chicken Berry Biryani: good, but too spicy for me. I didn't know it was a spicy dish, I had my friend eat most of this.-Mango lassi: omg!!! SOooooo goooood and creamy. I loved the little fennel seeds it comes with - added a nice touch to it. We were both pretty damn hungry coming into Dishoom but we couldn't finish everything. The portions don't look that big but it was all very filling. So glad I got to try this place in London! Probably the best real meal we had in London.",

    "text": "Dishoom is a beloved string of modern Indian restaurants in London. Though you'll find classic dishes like murgh malai and lamb samosas, Dishoom's rendition of Indian food is through the lens of Irani cafes in Bombay. The Covent Garden location is largely walk-in, and rain and shine you'll find shivering hordes waiting to get in and being treated to delicious cups of hot and milky chai. We timed it relatively well on a Sunday night and ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get in, and then another 15 at the bar.The cocktail list is long and to-theme, including a thoughtful list of mocktails. The majority are 8.50 pounds. Cyrus Irani, my choice, was a straightforward tequila sour; Debonair was a fine frozen drink. By far the best drink here is the Hoppy Paanch, an IPA, Johnny Walker, and butter syrup concoction that tastes far better than that description. I drank most of my boyfriend's (oops).Once seated in the cozy and buzzing downstairs, we ordered everything to share, with a little help from our waiter. Complimentary papadum with tri-colored dips was a satisfying, if standard, way to start off the meal; pau bhaji and okra fries (4.50 each) were both well-done and nice ways to continue our carb streak.Our larger plates were spiced and fragrant gunpowder potatoes (6.70); decent lamb chops (12.90) strewn with pomegranate seeds; a fine chicken ruby (10.50); and a delicious but small prawn dish (17.50). Although we were happily in a food orgy, mopping up sauces with naan, I couldn't help but wonder what I was missing.Everything was done well, but nothing was really above and beyond in the way that, say, Pondicheri in Houston is. Prices are elevated but not too bad; we had a bill around 75 pounds for our party of four (excluding drinks), and that was somewhat inflated by the prawns. Service is rushed but reasonable given the popularity. Bathrooms are very nice. Decor and atmosphere in general is great.I understand why Dishoom is a must-go in London, and it has plenty of convenient locations, but I was expecting something just a little extra.",

    "text": "One does not go to London without going to the legendary Dishoom. It's the only place on Yelp that has 1300+ reviews and 4.5 stars. I had high expectations and was nervous that this place would be severely overhyped, but Dishoom was an A+ in my book.I heard the wait times can be insanely long (one night we called and they said it was 2 hour queue for dinner). So we decided to go the next day for lunch and prayed to the food Gods. We got there at 12pm on the dot and our prayer was answered as we got seated immediately. The place was already packed on both levels. Decor is cute and what I love about this place is that for every meal purchased, they donate a meal to an organization charity :) More reasons to eat here!We ended up with the chicken tikka masala (called chicken ruby on the menu), the paneer masala, black house daal, garlic naan, and the keam. Everything was beyond fantastic. As everyone suggests, I highly recommend the chicken ruby and \u00a0daal (vegetarian and slow cooked for 24 hours). Consistency was nice, creamy, and not overly thick. Tender chunks of meat that just pair so well with the naan. Thankfully for me, the food was not terribly spicy which made my eating experience more enjoyable.Service was prompt, courteous, and on point. Water was always refilled without asking, and the flow of the place didn't make me feel rushed despite the growing lines outside.Overall, I would recommend coming here to cross it off the bucket list. Wasn't expecting such amazing Indian food in London and am pleasantly surprised, but no complaints here :DNote: the dishes do not come with rice. You need to order it separately and it costs around $3USD per bowl. Note 1: there also seems to be sister locations of Dishoom nearby? Haven't been there but would imagine it to be similar, so if this place is packed maybe stop by it's other location.",

    "text": "I have to say this restaurant is overrated. Their food is good, but it's not that good.They do not take reservations. We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs. Once again, their food is good but I don't think it's worth waiting for close to an hour. We ordered the lamb chops (my favorite), murgh malai, and chicken ruby. I would give 4 stars for the food, but with the long wait, I cannot give more than 3 stars.Pro-Tip:Even if the queue looks relatively short outside, it's likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs.I would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone. There are many other good restaurants in London and there's also better way to spend time than waiting in line.******************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

We had to wait for about an hour, but the staff offered us free samples of their drinks and allowed us (and other guests waiting) to sit in their bar. There was seating in the bar and several people ordered drinks while they waited. It was a nice place to meet other tourists/locals. When we were seated our serve was wonderful! He walked us through the menu and suggested dishes. The food was outstanding and we cannot wait to go back during our next trip to London. Thank you for this special experience!",

    "text": "It is well known that London has a sprawling Indian food scene that serves some of the best Indian cuisines outside of India. Dishoom, a small chain of seven \"Bombay Cafes\", is definitely on the top of the list for both locals and tourists alike.Online reservations can be made for breakfast and lunch only. They do not accept reservations for dinner and the only way to get in is the old traditional way - stand in line! There have been times when we walked past a Dishoom during dinner hours and saw lines wrapping around the block.The \"Bombay Caf\u00e9\" style features a casual but moderately upscale and comfortable environment with cool vibes. The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant, and is always a perfect place to chill, and to grab some yummy Indian food with a couple of bottles of Kingfisher.VEGETABLE SAMOSAS: \u00a0The skin was paper-thin and fried to a perfect crispiness that when I sank my teeth into it, the skin just crumbled and melted away while the filling made with veggies and mashed potatoes greeted my mouth with a warmly spicy yumminess.CHICKEN RUBY: \u00a0It looked like a variation of the famous tikka Marsala which was a tomato based curry with cubed chicken breast meat. \u00a0The ruby dish, however, came with makhani sauce which was silky and smooth. It really tasted like tikka Marsala but with a stronger flavor of ginger and garlic. It had a nice balance of sweetness versus spiciness and was delicious beyond words.GUNPOWDER POTATOES: \u00a0If you asked me to recommend a \"must-order\" item then this is it, not just because it was so amazingly good, but also because you can't find this anywhere else. Skin-on potatoes were fire grilled, cut into pieces, then saut\u00e9ed with butter and an abundance of peppers and exotic spices. It was without a doubt one of the most memorable potato dishes that I've ever had.We also had a roti to mop up the sauce from the ruby chicken, some rice, and a bowl of vegetables. Everything was good beyond belief.5 stars+",

    "text": "Heard about Dishoom from a friend who traveled to London recently and they really hyped on the quality and the wait time haha.If you are feeling peckish around 3-4 you can get in to Dishoom without any wait on a weekday (we did at least). The interior decor is definitely a highlight of the experience, because there are so few places decorated with such authenticity and classic beauty as Dishoom. Its done in the old style of colonial Bombay and is really awesome to just sit and soak in.The food quality is quite impressive as well. We kept our dish selection limited as we weren't terribly hungry. but we had the pleasure of enjoying the Ruby Curry & the Black Bean specialty dish with two garlic naans. The chicken inside the ruby curry was perfectly moist and very well cooked. the Garlic naan also was not overwhelmingly garlic flavored and was a perfect balance to the flavor of the curry.Mango Lassi is a definite pickup if you are here.Would come back.",

The black daal is amazing, although there's so much else I want to try here it's hard to say whether I'd get it again next time. The chicken ruby, on the other hand, would be hard to ever skip -- I get that this is the most basic of Indian dishes, but it's so incredible, and the one here is probably my favorite. Of course, the naan (both the regular and, especially, the garlic) are amazing too. I really liked the roti as well, but it wasn't at the same level as the naan in my opinion, and actually made me appreciate how incredible the roti is at Roti King (where I went for the first time on this trip).Overall, really amazing food for surprisingly cheap prices, if you can get in...",

I'm not a HUGE fan of daal in general, but they season it very well.The bollybellini cocktail was delicious, I could have had 3 more if i wasn't so full from the food we ordered!Calamansi smash I thought it was acceptable in comparison to the other, but my boyfriend really loved it.I forgot the name of our server, but he was only on his 4th day serving and was absolutely amazing! He was friendly and very on top of everything. Checked up on us regularly and was never too far.I think he was from Spain?Anyway, the reviews aren't overly hyped, this place is legit and you have to make time to stop here.",

The first time, my dining partner and I ordered a variety of dishes and tried two different types of cocktails each. While I don't remember the cocktails anymore (I believe they were whiskey sours), I do remember that they were delicious - although not the most alcoholic. We shared the plain naan, chicken biryani , house black daal, and spicy lamb chops. I loved the spicy lamb chops and ate all of it since my partner was vegetarian :); the chicken biryani, although huge, was a bit too bland for my taste with dry chicken. The next time, another dining partner and I tried the jackfruit biryani, and cheese naan. GET THE CHEESE NAAN. It was the most delicious thing I've ever had. Also, I loved the different types of Kulfi on a stick - my dining partner from India said it should've been only a few cents on the streets of New Delhi, but I didn't mind spending a few bucks for the most delicious and creamy dessert of my life. Great service - make a reservation and you'll be all set!",

Definitely recommended to make a reservation - it's really easy on their website, and there is almost always a line when coming in. Easiest/most painless way to get a table here is to make a reservation for lunch, and breeze right in past the long line forming by the door.Service is polite but somewhat curt and rushed given the amount of people there are coming through. There is a very large downstairs seating area, and the booths have fun fans that cool you down from the spice.Their menu is huge with a variety of dishes from across India. Most of the dishes are sized and made to share, and the back has a large drinks and chai menu. The drinks are very small portions. Lassi is thick and yogurty, and the chai comes creamy and sweet. Favorite dishes:House Black Daal: Amazing, very spicy and creamy. Chole Poori - chickpea curry with a very interesting pairing of sweet halwa mash, comes with puffy poori bread. Delicious must have.Paneer: their paneer dishes are delicious, all well flavored with chewy paneer. The mattar paneer came in a sauce that was very tomato-y, and had very few peas.",

    "text": "varunmurali.com/blog/dis\u2026Irani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them. I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay. At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska, spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it, and of course the timeless salli boti.I've actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India. So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay's Irani cafes.I really wanted to love Dishoom, but unfortunately I felt a little let down. Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine, I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it. They did have bun maska (though not for lunch) and keema pav and a few other classics.DishesThe keema pav was pretty delicious. Spicy and authentic. Complemented the hot buttered pav really well. I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was.My friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries. He was not wrong. They were super tangy and chatpata. Fried well and not oily at all.My friend ordered the pav bhaji. Not a fan. The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth. I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you're eating in a pav bhaji. You need different textures to come through. The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy. It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji. \u00a0  The chicken biryani was the biggest let down. Mild, bland, uninspired. The chicken was tender I'll give it that. Not much else going on with the dish. It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked.You can't keep me away from black dal. The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it. Good, not great. Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure.Oh and the rose lassis were pretty great!Would I come back?I think I would maybe once a month or so, but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers. Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is!I think the small plates are super value for money. They get you pretty full and taste great. Definitely worth checking out!",

I totally recommend this place to enjoy fusion indian food for an original and tasty brunch",

Was a bit taken back by the statement of 'an hour wait' by a server without even so much a look at the books. Turns out it was only 20 minutes. Dishoom's sharing concept is a rarity I am afraid, but it is a very welcome rarity. As others have said, it is not the finest Indian in Central, the Bollywood-esque decor isn't particularly interesting but fun, and the service is expected but not above par. The dishes were hot, the variety wide, and our hunger satisfied. We shared a couple of grill plates (the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and \u00a0Mushroom Paneer), some Lamb Biryani, and the Chili Cheese Toast. I would patronize again.",

    "text": "I have been to Dishoom a couple of times and the quality of the food has been consistently high. \u00a0I first visited for brunch, when I was looking for something other than the typical American breakfast items, and the concept of an Irani Cafe in old Bombay did sound intriguing. \u00a0I really like the design and the whole concept of the restaurant, and it does seem that you are teleported back to the hay day of Bombay Cafes. \u00a0My friend complained about the noise level but I thought that added to the ambience of the place, being a bustling and busy roadside joint.Now the food - usually I am a bit skeptical of places that try to be hip and claim to sell authentic traditional food at the same time, but I think Dishoom did a pretty good job. \u00a0We have tried almost everything on the menus and all of them were good. Although here are the dishes I will order every time: any of the grills really, they were all well executed but I especially enjoyed the succulent spicy lamb chops; the masala prawns ; the chicken berry biryani; the okra fries; and the mattar paneer for vegetarians. \u00a0The naans are also pretty good. \u00a0I also like the kulfis and the chais, lovely! Recommend the brunch menus as well - as I said, a nice alternative to the normal brunch fare. \u00a0The Covent Garden location is good for bringing visitors, a lot of them request Indian food and Dishoom is a good option. \u00a0Service is also very efficient for such a busy place. \u00a0I just love the energy and noise of the place!",

    "text": "Hmmm... well there were certainly loads of pros to Dishoom, mainly the delicious, spicy, fresh, and utterly fantastic food. But outside of the steaming hot plates of goodness that came quickly and seemingly endlessly, I wasn't overly impressed. Sure, with a sterile atmosphere like this you have the benefit of not reeking of curry when you leave. Your eyes won't burn, you won't be pushed around by storm trooper servers, and you won't feel rushed out of your seat by the next group of people who have been standing over you drooling for over an hour... (You *know* who I'm talking about.) Consequently though, you'll feel like you're eating Indian food in veritable Cheesecake Factory atmosphere. The whole urban industrial feel just didn't correspond with the cuisine.The service also seemed a bit off. Our group of 12 was split over two four-person booths, as apparently they don't take bookings. (In fact, we were probably lucky to get a table for all of us, full stop.) Our table never received water though we asked multiple times. A few lassies went missing. Though we ordered two of everything, the orders seemed to be confused over the two tables. I can't fault the delicious food -- it really was stunning. But the rest of the experience didn't dishoooooom me away.",

We swan around like we're Lord of the Manor, thinking our curries of the mile are as authentic and mindblowing as pizza in New York, burritos in San Francisco, Scouse in Liverpool.Hey. Scouse is important. It's a culinary behemoth!Anyway, sometimes we really need taking down a peg or two, and Dishoom really knocked me into shape. First of all, it was different. All clean, shiny surfaces; metallic minimalism... you couldn't call it traditional if you tried, certainly a far cry from the linen tablecloths and chintzy decor I'm used to in Rusholme. Then, the dishes, and I have to tell you - this is the way to eat Indian food. Forget getting your own specific dish, you want a multitude of plates in the middle of the table and you want to mix and match. Tapas-style sharing is what I like best when it comes to dining, and this was perfect.It's not for the faint of tastebud, as some of the dishes pack a punch - the samosas are spicy, the utterly scrumptious fish fingers are tingly, but there's plenty of raita to cool things down and if that's not enough, soothe your senses with a lassi... rum optional, wink. The paneer salad is all kinds of lush and Lizzie is so right about that Pau Bhaji, very simple but effective? Mightily so. I was one of her very happy campers that evening and I can attest to the fact that we heartily ploughed our way through this divine dish.They even do breakfasts with an Indian twist, with lots of delicious spiced pastries, and I'd walk back to London if it meant sampling that delicious-sounding chai hot chocolate. This is definitely a place to take somebody to impress, and I'll certainly be recommending it to my London friends. I'll also be warning them that they don't take reservations, so my tip is to get there nice and early!",

Apart from sounding like a village on the east coast of Scotland (try saying it in your very best Sean Connery accent....see!!), Dishoon is a rather upmarket, trendified Indian serving tapas style dishes of amazing quality and fantastic taste.A number of us piled in here for some grub after an arduous day of arse-sitting-on and brain filling-upped-ness....very tiring don't you know! To be treated to some rather fookin tasty grub, ranging from old favorites to some pretty unique dishes (all amazing). Being a large group we were spread out over two booths, a bit of a tight fit but good for group bonding.....Dishes were brought at a steady pace, drinks were kept a flowing and service in general was prompt, polite and well...good. Price?? Well, ok its maybe a bit on the high end, but given the area and the quality of the food, then its little wonder its a tad n the high end.Verdict then? Great grub, great service and a great way to have a culinary affair on the city you love.....Look out for Jeremy Kyle: He cheated on me with anther city...Glasgow spills Chris's sordid culinary secrets...booo, hiss!!!!",

Bear in mind if going downstairs you won't get mobile signal. Now back to the food and service. Service was good but I found it strange that they don't sell coke or Pepsi. Now they sell the Indian brands such and Thumbs up and Limca and also normal lemonade so why miss out the other. Very odd. Also they serve some great chutneys but nothing to go with them at the start which is also stranger as what are you supposed to do with them till your food arrives. But end of the day it's all about the food which was excellent and I will be going again. It's not spicy but extremely tasty. Took a little time to get out of the kitchen but not too bad. The portions are average but the grills are what you would expect as a starter portion \u00a0not a main course but I still think good value. Highly recommend this place. But might be worth booking prior to avoid waiting in a queue.",

The mango lassi here is very authentic (unlike the bright artificial orange-colored ones that you usually find in Indian restaurants), and they use whole roasted fennel rather than the powder, so the flavor is really enhanced. Everything we had here was wonderful except the Roti, which was very dry and didn't add to the meal. Perhaps if we had ordered it with curry it would have tasted better. We ended the meal with chocolate chai, and were very happy campers indeed! The decor also is very cute and apparently inspired by Parsi-owned cafes in Mumbai. Service was top notch with incredibly friendly and informative waiters! Will definitely be back soon!",

The cocktails are impressive and always worth getting (I love me a Bombay Pimms or a Chaijito), the service is great, and the food is incredible. Some of my favorites are:- Black daal: a must- Chicken ruby: another must- Dishoom calamari- Roomali roti- Chai (duh)Surprisingly not my favorite:- Chocolate chaiTip: Come at an odd time, otherwise you'll be queueing for a while (but at least they give you free chai -- or sherry! -- while you wait).",

Food is just fine--over-spiced and lacking subtlety or variety of flavor but made with fresh ingredients. A request for \"extra yogurt on side\" got me a vat of the stuff. Chai spice is VERY PRESENT but fails to complement the tea, masking it instead. The food may have the right components, but the soul necessary to combine them properly isn't there. The ambiance is Corporate Chain inside a Mall of America. Staff was pleasant!",

Once you do finally score a table, the food comes out quickly after ordering, but you can also while away the time sipping on their many delicious libation offerings.The food is so good! Perfectly seasoned, spiced and cooked. We didn't have one bad bite. My life was changed as soon as I sunk my teeth into cheese naan, which I didn't even know existed!!! My two kids (ages 4 & 8) had Indian food for the first time here...Dishoom may have set the bar too high, whoops!",

    "text": "I've been to a few Indian restaurants in the U.S., but none of them has ever come close to Dishoom. A friend and I had to wait in line for 45 minutes on a Monday night when I was in London. During the wait, they handed out some hot water with mint as it was chilly and raining in London that night.As soon as we were seated, they took our orders. The food here is served tapas style (small plates that can be shared amongst your party). 1) Chicken Ruby - It is very similar to chicken tikka masala. It has a delicious, creamy tomato-based sauce that is very flavorful. Hands down, one of the best dish Indian dishes I've had in my life.2) Black House Daal - Although this dish was flavorful, it didn't stand out to me as much, probably because it was overshadowed by the other dishes we ordered.3) Vegetable biryani - I think the biryani could have used some more flavor. I personally didn't think there was anything special about this dish. I would assume their lamb biryani is tastier, and I would definitely order that instead when I come back. 4) Mattar Paneer - The tomato-sauce base is very similar to the Chicken Ruby's, but with panner and vegetables instead of chicken. My friend is a vegetarian and really enjoyed this dish; highly recommended for the vegetarians.5) Garlic Naan - The naan is crispy on the edges and chewy, soft, and buttery on the inside, just the way I like my naan. They definitely does not skimp out on the garlic flavor of the naan. It is delicious! I would book a flight to London today just for this if I could.6) House Chai - The perfect balance of sugar, spice, and everything nice in one hot drink, perfect for a chilly London evening.I would definitely come back to Dishoom when I visit London again.",

    "text": "We had heard so much about Dishoom, from friends and colleagues and everyone asked us to try it when we told them we were visiting London. I was almost sure I would be let down because this was just too much hype, but boy Dishoom delivers. To start off, there is always a wait, we tried thrice, at three different times and there was a wait each time. We waited for about 30 minutes, the line moved quickly. We waited at the bar for 10 minutes and their cocktails are pretty amazing, we had the chili martini, pimms and an old fashioned and everything was great. A friend tried the sweet and salty nimbu soda (lemon soda) which was so authentic, just like the ones we used to have as kids and they even let us adjust the salt to sweet ratio! We ordered a lot of food and nothing disappointed. For starters we had chilli cheese toast, vada pau, bhel puri and paneer tikka. The paneer tikka and Vada pau were exceptionally good ! Chilli cheese toast is a childhood favorite so that was my personal favorite. For the main course we had the black dal, a couple of chicken biryanis and the Chana Batura, the dal and Batura were lip smacking good. Can't fault the food in this place, it's really tasty. We were too stuffed to the dessert or have coffee and chai. If only they were not so crowded all the time we would have had a few more meals here. I especially like the sound of their breakfast menu. Until next time Dishoom,it's time to open one in NYC !! The service was lovely. Attentive and very polite even though they were handling such huge crowds.",

After about 40 minutes, we were taken into the bar and finished waiting there. It honestly didnt feel as long as it was rather it just felt like part of the experience.The inside is simply but well decorated. The staff is very friendly and helpful about explaining the food and how the restaurant works. My friend is indian and so she ordered for both of us. The food came pretty quickly and everything we ordered was delicious. The chicken biryani was probably the best Ive ever had and went perfect with the daal. Overall a fabulous meal. The restaurant does not disappoint and I get the hype around it. Highly recommend but pro tip is to head there around an hour and a half before you want to eat.",

    "text": "Visited Dishoom in its very centrally placed location before a matinee performance of Miss Saigon. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Pau Bhaji, House Black Daal, Roomali Roti, Basmati Rice, Garlic Naan and Matter Paneer. It was, as you might suspect, a lot for a party of three. But everything was wonderful, so other than portion control I really had no issue with our very large order. I especially liked the Matter Paneer! I'm not usually one for vegetarian dishes, but the sauce was rich and flavourful which fit my palate perfectly. The Pau Bhaji was good, but I don't really enjoy having fried bread as a \"bread\" so perhaps if you share my preferences, you could skip that.Service here was excellent! Our server checked in with us every once in a while, ensuring that we never ran out of water etc. My only gripe would be that it was a little pricey. One garlic naan is 2.50 and when that's converted to SGD, that's around 5 dollars! One naan in Singapore is probably half that price at worst. Oh well!All in all, great food, great service but not so great prices.",

I dream about going back to London just to eat at Dishoom again cause there is nothing like it. I've been to Dishoom 3-4 times. For both breakfast and lunch. The breakfast is amazing with the limitless chai (although not sure this limitless applies to all locations). My favorite is the fruit and yoghurt. Which I don't know how they make their yogurt and have attempted to recreate. (I even bought a yogurt maker to make it and also googled various recipes to try - all to no avail). Their yogurt has the just right amount of sweetness to it with the honey and vanilla. With the fruit I could eat this everyday. The naan rolls (sausage and bacon) are amazing as well. I love the tomato jam in the rolls, that I asked the waiter if they sold the jam and sadly they do not but if they did, I would buy it. For lunch I agree with the other reviews. Bombay Colada. WOW and WOW. Again tried to re-create this drink at home to no avail. Just amazing. I could drink like 10 of these. Also agree the black house daal is one of a kind. Very flavorful. At Shoreditch I got the Lamb Raan Bun which was like a lamb pull apart sandwich. Exceptional. Overall Dishoom is just amazing. I think an exceptional restaurant is food taken to another level which makes it unique from others and to their own. Also to the point that you can't just go home and recreate it. You have to go there in order to eat it. Dishoom is both. Their food is unlike other Indian restaurants you have tried and in attempts to recreate it, I've tried and failed. I wish they would release a cookbook as I would be the first to buy it!!",

She was very energetic and steered us toward her favorite dishes, all of which were incredibly delicious. We ordered the far far, crisps that were buttery and spicy great dipped in the green sauce! We had chicken tikki that was absolutely amazing, garlic naan (mmmm!), the house black daal (that was seriously the best sauce any of us have had), and the chefs special lamb dish--can't be beat. Overall, 5 stars for every aspect.

I've no idea what properly is, but it seems like they've been stirring a cauldron of the stuff out the back for hours, sweetening it up and straining it through cloth at the point of pouring so you don't wind up with any spice chunks in it. The sort of spiciness that after 3 or 4 sips leaves you wondering if it's meant to make your face go like that, or if you're possibly allergic to one of the ingredients. Fantastic stuff! And the bacon naan rolls. Whoever invented that needs some sort of national recognition. What could be better?! Freshly made naan bread. Chutneys & some indian stuff. And sweeeeet, nourishing bacon. I suppose I can make this admission here among this tiny circle of close friends \u00a0Dishoom bacon naan rolls are the only thing I will ever refer to as Indian Street Food, because the second time I ever had one I didn't realise they'd cut it in half for me, and I dropped half of it on the ground \u00a0and it was SO good that I invoked the 3-second rule. Authentic street food indeed. Oh, I shouldn't have written this. Now I really, really want one.",

Considering I am not actually a huge fan of Indian food, I reconsidered this foodie goal -my experience at Dishoom completely changed my opinion. This place is incredibly lively; we arrived on a Saturday night at Covant Garden at 6pm to find an hour and a half wait for four people. Surprise! After picking up the free wi-fi, so huge for a traveler, our dining companions had scored a seat and cocktails at the basement bar. The cocktail lounge is worth a visit; it's like a speakeasy with Bollywood music with fun bevvies like the Chai Spice Mojito. The food was family style and loved each bit! Now, it's about as modern as you can get; and our table with a peanut allergy, garlic allergy, vegetarian, and me, the most picky human on earth, still left us full with delight. We ordered a hodge podge of cheese filled naan, grilled prawns (my favorite), dika (black sauce uniquie to dishoom) and curry-spiced okra fries. My southern soul was at home. We switched up to wine and continued the conversation throughout the night with coffee and amaretto and enjoyed the bustling scene the first night of London.",

Everything was very good indeed, with none of the same-flavour experience that you sometimes get in a high street curry house. The menu is designed for sharing, with smaller plates and larger portions and it all comes up pretty much at the same time. But they are very accommodating \u00a0you can order some smaller dishes and eat them, then order more, big or small. We were encouraged to do just this. (and we did) So we had fried skate cheeks and crispy calamari, both very differently spiced, and a keema pau (listed as a small dish but almost enough for a light meal!), lamb chops, (4), black dhal, a home-style house 'Ruby' (a chicken curry) and lamb biriani, all lovely. The black dhal was rich, creamy and soothing, the lamb chops were outstanding, tender and with a good spice hit, the chicken curry was a delight and the lamb biriani was delicate and aromatic (if just a little short on lamb).Other good things \u00a0a trio of chutneys, all fresh tasting and nothing like the dreaded 'chutney tray' with its over-sweet mango and tired kachoombar. And the bread! The roti was almost ethereally light and elastic. We had four between three of us. Plain nan was every bit as good as the one in your favourite Indian. We drank icy, refreshing lassi. The cocktails look most enticing, will definitely try them next time \u00a0and there will be a next time. We paid about \u00a328 a head, including service, and we were stuffed.

I tried both dishes and I liked the preparation of both eggs, with a slight preference for what I ordered. The omelette for the Full Bombay is slightly spicier. We both didn't like the Cumberland sausage in this combo though. I'd also recommend the Chocolate Chai over the regular Chai.",

    "text": "This is a 5 star venue if there ever was one. Besides all the positives that i will mention below, the one thing that will make me come back here again and again is that they sell Thums-Up (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th\u2026). I won't have to go to East Ham for a bottle again :)I heard of the newly opened Cafe Dishoom (the word is used to denote the sound made by a punch) from the numerous rave reviews, especially here at Yelp. We tried to go on friday night but we would have had to wait and we were getting late for a movie. So it was a saturday night when i first tried Dishoom out.The decor is spartan, but with a good dose of bombay in the form of bollywood posters \u00a0... actually quite like what you would expect a cafe in Bombay to have. They serve wine in the small glasses that people in India have tea in. Their owners have said that Dishoom will serve \"street food of south Bombay with a 'London twist'\". The effect of the fusion is there for everyone to see.Since its a street food place, you won't find the curries that are the mainstay of Indian restaurants in London. In fact the only liquid dish that i observed in the menu was dal. In this respect this place seems like a lower end version of Amaya. You have to order 2-3 dishes per person. I had the lamb biryani which was fabulous. Definitely among the best that i have had in London. It wasn't served with the tasteless curry that other Indian places use as a biryani accompaniment. Instead i ordered a side of raita which went wonderfully well with the rice. I also had nan and dishoom chicken tikka. It had an extra dose of chilli and ginger and the chicken pieces were exceptionally succulent. Full marks for the kebab.For dessert i had the malai kulfi on a stick ... another quintessentially Indian preparation. The stick was rather long and so i ended up having quite a large quantity of the kulfi :)The only somewhat less than perfect aspect of the experience was that my Thums-Up was not very cold. But i am sure that this was an exception and can ignore it for the time being.Given its prime location in Covent Garden, the price cannot be very cheap. But i had my fill of drinks, food and dessert for about \u00a325 ... i think that's reasonable. I will surely return ... several times actually :)",

We ordered small plates, calamari and lamb samosas, they came quickly and were delicious. The chicken tikka and the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and spiced. The garlic naan and basmati rice were excellent. The cucumber onion salad was interesting and tasty. The mint tea was made fresh and the nimbu pani (a lemon, soda, sugar and salt) drink was unusual and lovely. Order the house chai, very traditional and warming. Also the chocolate mousse was a culinary masterpiece. The ambiance was pleasant, and the waitstaff were considerate and prompt. While the bill was not light, it is worth it for the experience. Evalina (?) was a great server. She was attentive but not hovering, and very helpful with spot on menu tips.",

    "text": "So, I am sorry to be the one writing this review but my experience at Dishoom wasn't all that great. Unfortunately so because the place has a lot of potential!Firstly, our group of 6 was squeezed into a booth for 4 people with no way of adding at least one extra chair as it would block the passage way. Note to restaurant - if you didn't have a table for 6, we would have either waited a bit longer or would have come back another day.Anyways, we decided to look beyond that and move to the food. The small plates were very good. We tried the keema pau, pau bhaji, the squid and the vegetarian and lamb samosas. I think the Keema pau and squid won hands down. So far so good.Moving on to the main course - we ordered daal makhni, seekh kebab, saag paneer, chicken tikka, a chicken tikka roll and naans and roomali roti. The dal was excellent (most Indian restaurants in London don't serve dal makhni), the seekh kebabs were some of the best I've eaten in London, the saag paneer was good and this is the first Indian restaurant in London where I've eaten roomali rotis. However, I can't comment on the chicken tikka or the naans because by the time I ate those - they were cold. Why, you may ask? Well, it so happened that this restaurant is based on a \"we'll bring it as it's ready concept\". In case you've eaten Indian food before, you'll quickly realize that you need the daal, vegetables and naan all together, in order to enjoy the meal. Secondly, the ordering system (handheld palms or something), was broken that night. So there must have been quite a bit of commotion in the kitchen. And our order got lost. So while we received the starters very quickly, it took almost 60minutes for all the dishes of the main course to arrive - and hence, the naan that arrived in the beginning was cold 45 minutes later. And in all this, we were completely ignored by the staff - to the extent of walking past our table and looking the other way!The restaurant owner did come to our table to apologize profusely and gave us a 50% discount on the bill and free dessert (try the gola). But having said that - this kind of service was a big risk to take, especially in an area where there are 10 Indian restaurants in a 2mile radius! Would I give it another chance - yes probably as the food was actually very very good. But the next time, I take my business (and my stomach) elsewhere!",

    "text": "Of course when you're in England, you must do as the Brits do - and eat Indian food! And, being that I am a native (both British and Indian) I needed to experience some home cooking while in my former home. I took Bob to Dishoom and it did not disappoint. The host was very friendly and we were seated right in front of the huge open kitchen, where we got to see the chefs preparing naan. We were actually really lucky as we arrived around 7:00pm and beat the rush that followed immediately after. We ordered the soft-shell crab, butter naan, tandoori prawns and the tandoori chicken. The naan was hot and fresh - that perfect balance between a little bit burnt on the outside but chewy in the middle. The shrimp were fantastic, perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The chicken was phenomenal - super tender, you literally didn't even need a fork to cut it, it just fell apart. And the soft-shell crab was their self-pronounced specialty and it was fantastic. The curry was very nice, not as spicy as I would've liked but still tasty - the only complaint I had was that it did have a bit too much coconut milk in it for me - a bit too sweet. After gorging on all that savory goodness, we also had dessert. We split the rice pudding - and it was perfection. You could really taste the vanilla and had a wonderful pudding texture. All in all, this place is very good! I am sure there are more authentic Indian establishments around London - but this is just as tasty!",

Add the friendly waitstaff, the central location, and the nice interior design and atmosphere, and Dishoom has a good thing going on. My husband and I both liked the semi-open kitchen so you could see the chefs at work.

My wife is a vegetarian and I've acquired a taste for chicken over the last 3-4 years. We got a table immediately though it was a Saturday night. We're from the US and compared to the US restaurants, the tables were very close to each other; something we're getting used to during our Europe trip. We were greeted by a pleasant hostess who took our orders right away. The choices were limited compared to other Indian restaurants. But food arrived even before we could get comfortable in our chairs! Now that is fast, probably faster than a drive-through at McDonald's! AND the food was very well made. Tasty with the right amount of spices and cooked to the right degree. I timed an order for roti(bread) and got it in 2:10! My only critique of the food is that I would've liked the food to have been a little bit warmer. Not that it was cold but I like my food to be quite hot (temperature). Quantity was adequate (not like the typical huge American serving sizes). Price was actually less than most good Indian restaurants and dinner for 2 should be around \u00a325-30 without alcohol.All said, a great experience. I've reduced 0.5 stars each for limited choices and the rather warm food. Otherwise this is a really good restaurant for people interested in an Indian restaurant with good ambience and tasty food.",

    "text": "Full review &photitos on thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  I really liked Dishoom in a gushy, excited sort of way. I love Indian food at Tayyabs and in Brick Lane and Tooting like everyone else, but Dishoom is just so pretty and lovely inside and why can't Indian restaurants be funky and glamorous too? India can be an incredibly glamorous and romantic place, of Bollywood and colourful saris and love songs and chai shops. I never made it to Mumbai, but Dishoom (which is the sound made when the hero punches someone in a Bollywood film) is modelled on a Mumbai cafe and it's gorgeous inside \u00a0all newspapers and chai and low-hanging wires and lovely lighting and marble tables and a clock modelled on the one in Mumbai station. It is meant for you to wander in, grab a paper, sit and drink a chai and watch the world go by. (They also serve bhang chai and bhang lassi but I don't think these are the same as the ones I had in India which made my stay in Pushkar string out to two wonderfully lazy hazy weeks.) Anyway, it has a no reservations policy but we had no problem getting a lovely booth for 3 at 8pm last Wednesday night. And if you are more than 6 you can book the little cave booths downstairs which look like they'd be fun with a group of mates. I went on a platonic she-date with two fellow bloggers, Uyen from Fernandez & Leluu and Ute from Hungry in London and it was lovely to go along with girls who like their food as much as I do (although I had to stop Uyen from ordering half the menu). So onto the food, which I thought was fantastic. Really tasty delicious Indian food that doesn't make you want to crawl home on all fours and curl up on the sofa directly afterwards. Absolutely delicious were the succulent juicy lamb chops and the berry chicken biryani and I loved the paneer and mushroom salad. The battered fish and veggie samosas were lovely too \u00a0with some delicious chutneys which were a bit more interesting than the norm. Less successful were the chilli prawns (just a bit dull) and the lamb rolls (more like a lunchtime wrap) but we probably over-ordered (Uyen!) so this was fine. It wasn't too heavy, just deliciously spiced and interesting. And I didn't sweat profusely and go purple as is my norm with Indian food (sorry fellow diners at Tayaabs). Alongside all this food, we had rice and naan and a lovely bottle of wine and finished off with mint tea and chai and all this came to around \u00a327 each which makes it extremely good value - glamorous in a Cinammon Club/Kitchen kind of way but without the whopping price tag. AND there was no service charge to the bill which is refreshing. Service was great although they could give the glasses of water a rest and bring a jug instead \u00a0the waiter, although lovely and happy to tell us all about Dishoom, hadn't counted on how much water I need when eating spicy food and was probably buzzing round our table a bit too much. It would be PERFECT for a date or with a group of friends. If you're looking for a bite to eat in Covent Garden, this would be my choice.",

I'm usually pretty pleased with what I see sprouting up in our city's food-and-drink-scape, but rarely blown away. Then, a concept that's interesting, inspired and delicious comes along. Yeah, I really like Dishoom.Dishoom is an idealized version of an old school Bombay cafe. Decidedly stuck in mid century India without any pesky cobwebs and doing a fine job at staying just this side of kitsch, it's a themed restaurant that Londonist can imagine visiting time and time again. But not just for the distilled Bombay ambience.The food here is to savour. Dishoom's squid and prawn dishes tantalizes something fierce last night. And their green chilli cheese toast is scrummy (think Asian rarebit). The morning menu pleases immensely as well: best cuppa chai you're apt to find in town (or around Leicester Square anyway), awesome but not overwhelmingly lengthy list of items, decent prices, friendly service, comfy booths \u00a0and lots of yummies! Indeed, I reckon a reasonable facsimile of happiness is a sausage naan roll with chilli jam and coriander. And a delicious breakfast lassi is filling enough to last most people until lunch.es they serve breakfast, and bacon naan rolls with chilli jam and coriander seem like just the way to start a Central London morning on the go. And one or three of Dishoom's chilli martinis could be a splendid way to end it.Yay.",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full review, please see: wp.me/pwXBH-SQ \u00a0DISHOOM - NOT QUITE VA-VA-VOOM Summary:Dishoom purports to be London's first authentic Bombay Caf\u00e9. There is certainly some potential in the food, though based on my visits, there seemed to be issues with consistency at this early stage. It is not the type of place that would ever totally blow my socks off, but it could develop into being a good middle-of-the-road Indian restaurant with a twist. Given the time & money they are spending on their image & branding, it certainly appears as if the idea is to roll these out across the town, and the country for that matter, but only time will tell. It is certainly a pleasant space & if the present issues can be resolved, it's not a bad venue for a jovial meal if you're in the area \u00a0but nothing more than that, in my book. An interloping lunch I found out that my friend @mathildecuisine was having lunch near my office. She happened to be dining at Dishoom, an Indian restaurant on the restaurant row that Upper St Martin's Lane has suddenly become. It had just recently launched \u00a0hey, another day, another restaurant opening in London \u00a0and I figured it was a good excuse to try it. I only found out at the last minute that she was going to be joined by recently retired food blogger extraordinaire @foodieguide. I politely asked if I could crash their little party and become a lady who lunches too, in a matter of speaking of course, and was pleasantly surprised that the answer was 'yes' on such short notice. I actually used to work within about 10 seconds of the restaurant, and was slightly perturbed to see that there are now a bunch of new places sprouting up in the immediate vicinity which weren't there when I was. But I'm still only a short walk away, so it's not the end of the world. Dishoom looks attractive from outside and, given the fact that it has an all-window shell, you can easily see in to get a sense of the dining room as well. Once inside, it's all black metal, dark wood, marble and brass. It is tastefully done, and it has a nice vibe once it is full with patrons. There has been a lot of comment amongst the twitterati about the Bollywood-style pictures and mish-mash of memorabilia (the accusation being that they're of the cookie-cutter faux variety), but @kristainlondon (who is currently reinventing her virtual identity since having recently moved to Chicago) knows someone who knows the owners and apparently it is either mostly or all their own personal photos and artefacts. They must have one glamorous lady in the family, that' all I can say. Whatever you might think about the authenticity of the decor, there is definitely attention to detail (check out the female loos \u00a0not that I did of course) throughout. Anyway, I arrived to find my fair ladies already there, so we got down to the business of ordering pretty quickly. A tough call Caf\u00e9 CrispsWe ordered a few small plates and a few mains and, being food bloggers (or at least retired ones), we were naturally going to share and make sure we tasted everything. First up was a little snack to tide us over until the proper food arrived. They were advertised as being handmade and tangy on the menu, and while I assume the former is true, the latter descriptor was definitely apt. While I started out slow (a crisp here, a crisp there), they soon became rather addictive and I felt like I was eating more than my dining companions, which was especially rude given they are both such elegant ladies. An LF FP (faux pas) to say the least. Pardone moi! The crisps came with a trio of chutneys but for some reason I opted not to sample them, so they just sat there looking pretty. Is it just me, or are other people often confused about which chutneys are supposed to go with which dishes? Oh right, so it's just me then. Trio of LassisWe did however delve into our liquid trio of lassis: mango & fennel, rose & cardamom, and a salted plain one. I had the mango & fennel lassi, which was perfectly passable, though it wasn't thick or creamy enough for me and could have had a bit more mango flavour running through it. I wasn't blown away. Dishoom CalamariThe menu informed us that the calamari would be served with zesty lime and chilli. There must have been quite a bit of sugar (or some other sweetening agent) in them as well, because it was rather sweet overall. I didn't mind this so much as I have a natural disposition toward sweet things, but while the lime and chilli were there in the background, the flavors could have been a little better balanced. That said, they were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, without the taint of rubberiness which so often blights poorly cared for calamari. Spicy Lamb ChopsWe had ordered two lamb dishes which sounded very appetizing from the menu descriptions. The first I tried was the spicy lamb chops, which were meant to be rubbed with crushed black pepper and chillies. It certainly looked like they would be",

LA perhaps. But in LA the place would have been air conditioned. Still, I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the food, served family style in small portions to facilitate tasting, was delicious. The mango and paneer salad, the largest of the bunch, had a nice balance of salty cheese and sweet fruit. The chicken ruby was tender and rich, as was the black daal. Skate cheeks, served with a sweet chutney, were light and tender, and the bhel, a puffed rice and vegetable salad, was the perfect appetizer for that sultry summer evening. A sweet and smooth mango fennel lassi paired nicely, though I wish it had been a bit colder and more tart with a bigger hit of fennel seed. Quick and courteous service rounded out a lovely dinner.",

We've been here 5 times over the course of two years and love the authentic, Bombay street food-style small plates done just right.5 star dishes on the menu:-- Vegetarian (potato + peas filling) or the lamb kheema samosas - both are excellent and a safe bet.-- Okra Fries: crispy, savory, yummy. I dream of them. -- Keema Pau - mince lamb meat served with traditional bread called Pau- a little oily, but also spicy - the husband swears by it.-- Black House Daal: one of the best we've tried. Buttery and rich without being too overwhelmingly heavy to digest. (sample with white rice)4 star dishes: --Pau Bhaji: potatoes, tomatoes and other veggies mashed beyond recognition in a red color mixture that is a little fiery, a little tangy. I swear by it.-- Prawn Kolidwada: tiny prawns deep fried beyond recognition - what's not to love about pepper shrimp? 3 star dishes:-- Chicken ruby: the eponymous chicken tikka masala rechristened by Dishoom. A little too tomato-y for my liking, wasn't blown away by it. There are better dishes on this menu. Desert: I love the mango kulfi here, it's beautifully flavored with cardomom and not too sweet.Service: Very friendly and efficient most of the times.Decor: This is my favorite part. Modeled on the lines of mostly-defunct Irani cafes in Bombay, India, Dishoom stays true to spirit, elevating the retro-vibe to a more upscale level. Expect to see quirky ads and vintage Indian Bollywood posters that are a blast from the past for patrons like us. Nostalgia done right! Even the restroom wash basins are modeled from the ones in India back in the 60s and 70s. \u00a0 Tip: Get a reservation if you can. Otherwise expect to wait at least 25-30 minutes anytime of day or evening.",

We found out that the reservation service is at a headquarters offsite and that they don't know the true wait times. We were frustrated because we had hungry kids and we cancelled a reservation and had no real food options. The manager Luna stepped in and bent over backwards to make it work for us.

They offered us chai tea during the wait and it wasn't raining, so that was OK. They have an efficient system where they can tell you exactly how much you've been waiting and are very respectful of the order in which you arrived, so it felt like a fair process. We ordered the dahl (house recommendation, \u00a37), a chicken dish (\u00a311) with rice (\u00a32.50), and garlic and cheese naans (\u00a33 each). The dishes were good, but quite spicy, despite being described as mild, and not out of this world - very similar to Indian restaurants in Paris, which are not considered as the best preserved international food in France. The naans were incredible though - we hesitated to order more at the end of our meal, and one week after I'm still longingly thinking about them. Nah, I'm not food-obsessed AT ALL (: Is it good? I guess, if you are more of a spice-lover than us. Is it worth queuing up for 1 hour? Don't think so.",

Positives:- Like the decor and atmosphere (they were playing nice 1920s music which gave it that speak easy feel)- Friendly staff - \u00a0Chilli cheese toast - really good- Lamb Biriyani - tasty, tender and well cooked lambNegatives:- Tables were very close together (like they were trying to cram in as many people in there as they could)- Chicken Tikka roll - really salty chicken and very odd flavours (super sweet, then a spicy kick, too overpowering taste of ginger), just really didn't taste nice (especially the chicken)- The \"raita\" (this was just all wrong, no cumin, it had onions and tomatoes and lacked flavour big time), it was like a salsa that someone added yoghurt to, it was also such a huge portion (like a bowl full) - ordering process (we ordered the starters and only took the mains order while we were partway through eating the mains - a bit odd)- Lack of choice (only 2 curry options - chicken or paneer and not many starters)- You can't book a table for dinner (from 5:45) for less than 6 people So to summarise, would I come here again? Maybe (I would like to try the curry) but I'm not in any rush. Is it worth it to come here when you see massive queues outside? Hell no! (On principal, I never queue for restaurants anyway, but the food is definitely not worth queuing for).",

Their naan rolls are the best way to start the day (I'm torn between bacon and egg vs. sausage and egg, so I tend to switch off between the two each time I visit). For lunch/dinner, their gunpowder potatoes shouldn't be missed, and their raita is phenomenal. Pro tip: skip the chai, make note that their biryani dishes are a bit dry, and be aware that the food is spicier than expected (although this doesn't negatively affect the palate). Great service, too. Let's just say there's a reason Dishoom is rated among the top Indian restaurants in London. :)",

We saw a line outside and said lets give it a shot. So happy we did! While we waited outside they gave us Chai Tea or Mint tea while we impatiently waited. When we finally got inside we waited by the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails that were really good. They specialize in Bombay Gin and they re cocktails define fly live up to the name. For lunch we ordered the Chicken , the lamb, the peneer mango salad and the yogurt sauce. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. I wish this restaurant existed in NYC. I would definitely come back when I visit London again .",

The homemade samosas from my co-workers taste so much better.Chicken Ruby - Tasted like it was made with canned tomato sauce.Lamb Biryani - Again lamb was tough and not tender. Almost chalky, which again makes me think \"not fresh\". I cook with lamb very often and it's not difficult to get it tender. Rice had great flavor though.Garlic Naan - Very goodMango Kulfi - Very goodThe Line - As I finished my meal I counted the number of empty seats upstairs and downstairs when I went to the restroom...the number of empty seats exceeded the number of people standing in line, which was about 20 people. So why the line? To create false sense of exclusivity or popularity? Or are there simply not enough staff to handle a full restaurant?Overall, I say it's okay but not worth an 1+ hour wait in line.",

My first attempt was on a Sunday at 2PM, and even then was told that the wait would be 1.5 hours!!

No thank you! I tried again the next day around 12:30PM for lunch and this time was pleasantly surprised when I immediately got a table (I was eating alone so that's probably part of the reason!). I usually don't mind eating alone but this time felt really uncomfortable for the first 8-10 minutes when I was clearly waiting to order but none of the 5 waiters in the area bothered stopping by.Eventually I got the waitress' attention and she suggested that I try the chicken ruby (aka butter chicken) with garlic naan, which is exactly what I did! The garlic naan was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Just the right amount of crispy, still soft, and the garlic flavor was perfect. The chicken was spicy (which I love) but wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped -- I wish it were a bit creamier, but the meat was sumptuous and overall quite a good meal.One thing to note: for a 5'4\" girl, the food portions were perfect! However, it can be a bit pricy for the amount that you get, especially the chai latte which was microscopic! Still delicious, just a heads up to order more naan or another dish if you're very hungry!!",

I actually loved the atmosphere downstairs and would have preferred to sit down there rather than upstairs. We ordered the lamb samosas, garlic naan, black house daal, and chicken ruby. Everything was SO delicious! My favorite was the black house daal though - it's vegetarian and they cook it for 24 hours so it's super flavorful. We also ordered drinks, which were pretty good too!The prices are totally reasonable so would totally come back for another meal if/when we come back to London!",

Besides, people (me) who haven't been there in ten years have no business making assumptions. This trip changed my perception of London completely (from meh to love), and food was part of that. All thanks to Dishoom.My business partners wanted to take me someplace a little more authentic, off the Mayfair scene and into another neighborhood. I was so game. If nothing else, it returned the Mission/SoMa favor when they were in town a few months ago.I knew Dishoom and I were going to get along splendidly upon walking in and seeing one of the most beautiful clocks ever taking a iconic spot in the decor. Right above the kitchen, it's striking, and I want it. If my SF loft ever materializes, the Dishoom clock is going to be a featured part of the decor.Which means I'll have to go back to get it, which would be no problem at all. The four of us split some outstanding dishes:- Grilled chicken that became part of delicious roti rolls that rivaled my favorites at Kasa (yelp.com/biz/kasa-indian\u2026)- Stunningly good lobster straight out of the shell - Black daal that complemented the above perfectly- Fresh mangoes with vanilla yogurt. Can't. Ever. Get. Enough.Everything was washed down with a DG&T (gin, tonic and a few drops of Indian ginseng). Score.Only the veggie biryani underwhelmed. It could have used more veggies, less rice.From clocks to eats to drinks, it was a wonderful dinner out. My bad London, my bad. This SF foodie has never so loved being wrong.",

The servings are small and most of the dishes weren't that spicy. There was only one crab dish that was really delicious and warranted the more expensive price tag. Everything else I felt I had tasted better elsewhere. The benefits of this place is that it's nicely presented and the service is good, however in my mind not really worth it. Would recommend popping into tayabbs or needos grill instead.",

I really wanted to try Dishoom, though, mainly because of very good reviews I'd read and finally went there for lunch on Sunday. I loved the place, specially the decoration and furniture downstairs and the bathrooms. It's clear that a lot of attention has been taken regarding the decoration, I truly liked that. The food was very good as well. We (my boyfriend and I) weren't very hungry so we only shared three small/medium dishes: Roomali Dishoom Chicken Roll (tasty but way too spicy for me, my boyfriend ate it whole), Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb, delicious) and Dishoom calamari. The calamari were fantastic, a bit sweet, with chilli and lime, so good. I would go back to this place, specially if I had friends visiting me in London or something like that. I think it's a great place to go with a medium/large group, it feels lively, fun and very relaxed.",

Everything else was SUPER tasty, flavorful and fresh. The staff was on top of things and didn't blink when we asked for more water and daal during the meal.Big thanks to whomever on here recommended trying the cocktails. I had the Bombalda (pineapple, coconut milk, rum and spices) which was some fantastic Indian-esque take on a Pina Colada. Super tasty.

The portions are fairly small and it is expensive. We ended up ordering for the family of 6 and then ended up ordering again due to small portions. The Pav bhaji, vada Pav, paneer kathi roll and the daal were some of the favo",

    "text": "Found this place on Yelp while picking up some discount theatre tickets, and since we love Indian food and we heard the Indian food in London was amazing...this had to be tried. And oh boy was it delicious! We came in around 2:45pm local on a Friday, so it was a short wait...but after ordering the food (with some recommendations from the server), it was completely worth it. Specifically, the Chicken Ruby (their 'makhani' style dish) was off the chain, the House Black Daal was so so tasty, and the Lamb Boti Kabab was perfectly seasoned - extremely balanced and still juicy. Even the garlic naan was freshly glistening with butter!The only slight disappointment was the Prawn Koliwada - I think we expected something slightly different, and while it wasn't bad once the main dishes came out, we completely ignored it and crushed everything. This place is so so good!",

That I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO TRY IT. Ok..I reluctantly agreed to give it a try. Dishoom, according to our radar, was one of THE top Indian food restaurants. So...Dishoom it was! When we arrived, there was a mini line but it moved fairly fast (10-15 mins tops). We were offered some chai tea while we waited...interesting taste indeed. We were quickly moved into the basement where the bar was...not much seating but packed and cozy. Onto our food. We decided to yolo it and order pretty much one from each section. Great decisions made that night ;)!!GARLIC NAAN 2.20 -soft and fluffy naan bread with garlic flavors floating out while you eat. GET IT!STEAMED BASMATI RICE 2.20-typical rice..I got it mixed up with the yellow rice...but this does pair well with the curry dishes.OKRA FRIES 3.70 -deep fried and a tad oily.PAU BHAJI 3.90-super soft warm buns meant to be dipped in this veggie paste?...it was mouthwateringly tasty.GUNPOWDER POTATOES 5.90-chunks of potatoes mixed with spices and a hint of lime juice. It was a lifesaver when we got hungry in the middle of the night and decided to eat the leftovers. CHICKEN RUBY 8.2-not your typical curry flavor. I can't remember the exact taste but it was very flavorful.All the food we ate was delicious and the price point was perfect. I would def go again. Must try in London!",

The restaurant was absolutely packed but our waiter still took time to recommend and explain items on the menu. We ended up ordering a lot of food because we were ravenous after our wait. I don't know if it was because we had watched people eating through the windows while in line for so long or if the food was actually that good, but holy moly everything we ordered was delicious, flavorful, and made us forget our complaints about the wait! I'm sure you could close your eyes and point to any random dish on the menu, and it would be delicious. We ordered lamb biryani, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, black daal, and garlic naan. It was almost too much to fit on our small table! The black daal really stood out to me. It was creamy, savory, and unlike anything I had tasted before. I think I fell in love with the black daal that day.I finally understand why Dishoom is so popular and successful. I would gladly wait two hours in line just to eat here again! The hype is very valid and you won't regret it.",

    "text": "So, in advance of going to London, I was told to go to Dishoom as it was the best Indian restaurant. Since I was hearing this from another Indian person who is family, I felt I had to go if it was possible. Considering this location is right near Trafalgar Square, it was quite perfect to stop by in our travels.I was told in advance that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. Apparently it does. We arrived and were told there was a 40-minute wait. So, we put our name on the list, said screw it, and just walked around the general area. When we returned 30 minutes later, our name had already been called and they moved on. It was an annoying start. So we had to wait another 40 minutes that was actually 30 on their patio before being entered into Dishoom.We waited for a little while longer in their bar area before being seated. The vibe in Dishoom is pretty cool. It's packed and we were seated with other guests at long family-style tables. Okay, let me get to the point: the food is some of the best Indian food I've ever had at a restaurant. The house black daal is unbelievable. They claim it is \"cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony\" and you can taste the preparation. The harmony is delightful. For that alone, and at 6 pounds, it is worth going. The other items I got were the okra fries and the paneer tikka, both were delightful as well and I'm sure the meat options are good too for those interested.You could easily break your wallet if your eyes get too big for your stomach as everything looks and is delicious. However, for 2 people, we simply ordered these 3 items and garlic naan and it sufficed in the late afternoon after a long day of walking. To me, it was certainly manageable pricing for quite good food and ambiance in London.I still will rate Dishoom 5 stars but there were two downfalls. I would say the reservation and seating situation was just a little unclear and odd given the popularity of the restaurant. I also think the service was a bit odd at times. I mean it's odd for me as an Indian person to have a white guy tell me about Indian dishes, but hey, that's just me and I know that's his job. But, more so, our server just kind of disappeared at one point without telling us and another server seemed to have no choice but to start serving us and handle our bill when she realized that guy was just gone. But, the reservations/service situation aside, Dishoom was that good that it didn't matter. You should definitely check it out if in London and especially because I'd expect as a tourist you'd be visiting this busy area of the city at some point anyway.",

We had less than 15 minutes to order from the breakfast/brunch menu, but were not allowed to order from the lunch menu for nearly 30 minutes. Reminded me a bit of my childhood, going to McDonald's and driving up to the drive-thru window and finding out that you were either too early for the lunch menu or just missed the breakfast items by 3 minutes.We opted to share a popular breakfast item, the bacon naan roll with the house chai, and stick around to be one of the first to order from the lunch menu. By the time we received and consumed the bacon naan roll it was indeed time for lunch.Having already a base of food in our stomachs we didn't over order, which seemed like it could have been easy to do considering the extensive menu and the desire to want to try everything. We ended up going with some Dishoom staples, the black house daal (lentil curry), the chicken ruby curry, and some garlic naan and roomali roti to soak up some of the curry goodness.We enjoyed both curries and the accompanying chutneys with our roti and naan. And, in the end, we felt like we came at a good time - we were able to try a delicious popular brunch item and beat the lunch queue that grew quite quickly at 12:00pm.",

This was our fault, we just stumbled upon this place and showed up without reservations - make reservations! When we got in the place is really cool, it has an old time hipster decor and we ate downstairs which was less busy than the upstairs area. However, we were right next to the people to our left and right, almost felt like they were eating with us! But the food was really good, just be prepared for smaller portions (we ordered naan, rice and the black Dal in addition to our plates) I don't eat spicy food that often, so I ordered the least spicy thing and it was still pretty hott - but delicious. The black dal was by far the best, we put it on everything, dipped our bread in it, and it took a bit of the spice away when your mouth got too hott (highly recommend getting this). Cool place, very authentic! Drinks are also very interesting (but pricey) - the bartender kicks butt",

The service is just amazing, they charge 20% as service fee though. The food was good, not great. Living in San Jose, I think I have been spoilt and have many better food options available around. We tried the chili cheese toast, local beer, ruby chicken, rumali roti (which wasnt that great). Overall the food was pretty good, ambience, menu, service, drinks all pretty nice. Its more of an experience to go there and enjoy a meal. If you are looking for really good food, may be there are other indian places in London which serve better food as this was catered to the english taste.",

    "text": "Best Indian food I've ever had! When we arrived at Dishoom and there was a line outside... they took our name and informed us that there would be about an hour wait. Since all the reviews raved about this place, we decided to wait it out. While outside they walked around serving Hot Chai Tea, Hot Green Tea, and Sherry Liquor. The line based very quickly (about 30 mins) and we were inside. The hostess invited us to the bar to wait for the remainder of our time and gave us a buzzard for when our table was ready. We had barely sat down with our beers before it went off (maybe 10 mins). The food was simply amazing! So authentic and full of spice! My boyfriend has a sensitive mouth when it comes to spicy food, but this was not the case. It was intense spice flavor without the burn you get from really spicy foods. The whole meal passed with flying colors. Not even halfway through our dinner we both agreed that we would come here again because it was defiantly worth the wait!!!",

We also waited in line outside in winter for like 30 mins. This felt a bit nutty, but it was worth it. I wouldn't say this about too many places! Good for dates and good for a group of 4 but not much larger groups. It's loud and a bit hard to hear.",

    "text": "Entrance:Arrived around 8pm on a Saturday without a reservation. We were told the wait would be around an hour, but as there was no space at the bar downstairs yet, we had to queue outside. There wasn't any option to leave our name and return later either. This was by far the most entertaining queue I'd been in. First, they brought out hot milk tea for all of us. Then, the guy at the door asked us if we wanted to see some magic. He did a few tricks (found a card we picked, made a lighter disappear - this was particularly amusing as the lighter fell out of his sleeve a moment later) and while far from the best, his personality combined with the tricks made it very entertaining. Shortly after, we were let into the bar area. Bar:Managed to get some stools at the corner so we were comfy. There isn't much space at the bar area so I can see why they were full. Tried the dishoom ipa and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also ordered lamb samosas and calamari. The samosas were excellent but pricey for the portion (2 pieces for 4.2 pounds). Food:We ordered the Murgh Malai Chicken, Roomali Roti, Black Daal, Chicken Berry Brittania Biryani, and Raita. This order was just nice for 2 people (we actually doubled up on this as there were 4 of us).Everything was amazing! My one complaint might sound a bit weird but it's that the carb:protein ratio in the biryani felt a bit skewed towards protein. It might be because we added an additional chicken dish as well but it just felt like the dish as a whole was getting overpowered by the meat. I solved the problem for myself by giving some extra chicken to one of my friends. And I imagine for most people this won't really be a cause for complaint.Service:Prompt, attentive, friendly. And this covers everyone from the door to the bar to the table. Loved our server in particular. He was incredibly high energy.Dessert:I had the Mango Kulfi and tried a bite of the chocolate mousse. Tasty but nothing special. A slight let down given the high quality of the mains.Overall:Loved it! Already looking forward to the next visit. As I'm writing all this, I'm not even sure myself why I'm not giving it a 5. It just seemed to fall short somewhere (though I'm not sure where), but this is definitely at the top end of a 4 for me. (I really need yelp to be out of 10...)",

I was disappointed in the small size of the Mango Lasi and the naan bread. One of the things a I love about naan in the UK is that it normally comes in a huge piece. The naan served here is about the size of a normal tortilla cut in half. The seating was good and the service was also good. We go here right at 6pm and we were so lucky we only had to wait 40 minutes. When we left the queue was down the block. We had the vegetable curry paneer, the chicken tikka , and the chicken ruby. All of these dishes were superb, and the flavors were great. We also had garlic naan as well as the house slaw. Make sure to order a side of rice for the table as the curry can be spicy. We were excited to eat here and were glad we waited.",

I came here for brunch (I don't normally like burnch on Saturday because it means I have to get out of bed) with some out of town friends because I thought they should try brunch with a difference. We had a full English with a twist - it was all spiced with Indian inspired flavours. The eggs had a massals spicing and tasted divine, the sausage was locally sourced but obviously coated and cooked with some incredibly fragrant and aromatic spice mixture and even the beans came with a chilli twist. Yes it was expensive, \u00a311.50. But it was worth it. And instead of a mimosa, I sampled a Dishoom breakfast cocktail - orange and grapferuit juices with a splash of Ophir gin, which is oriental in flavour and again fills your palette with the most incredible rush of floral flavours.

    "text": "My friend took me to Dishoom in London calling it a restaurant which would hit very close to India. The reviews amongst Londoners I met prior to the meal were something along the lines of \"Best Indian restaurant\", \"Daal is to kill for\", etc., So with absurdly high expectations, we hit the restaurant at around 9:30 PM. Waited for 10 minutes and managed to get a spot at the bar with a further estimated wait time of 15 minutes for the actual table. At the bar, we ordered Okra fries and Samosa. Samosa - Tasted pretty much like Trader Joes frozen samosas heated up. Okra fries - Underwhelmed. No crispness to it. Favors didn't stand out either. After around 10 minutes of wait time, we got our table. I was willing to let go of the samosa and okra fries and give Dishoom a second chance. We ordered Vada Pav, Bhel Puri, Daal, Bread and Biryani.Vada Pav - Good. Not a home run, but good. Bhel Puri - Disaster. Where are my chutneys?! Why am I eating this bland puffed rice? I mixed in the chutneys from the Samosa to save the day. Daal - Really really good. They got their signature dish right.Biryani - I guess it was Kachi Biryani. Please don't tell me this is Dum. If I am trying to guess the biryani types, you know the biryani is in trouble. All I can say was it was some sort of curry rice. Outside of India, the restaurants worthy of mention are Himalaya in Houston, Texas, Vij in Vancouver, Canada, Rasika/Bombay Club in Washington DC, Indian Accent in New York. Dishoom is nowhere close. If I was in London, I would be visiting it yea, but not recommending it as the next best thing outside India.",

Roomali roti was a nice compliment to the white rice. The paneer roll was really badly prepared, however, and I ended up feeling sick after eating it. It was flavorless and nothing like you get in India or NYC. This was a real disappointment. Overall, worth checking out and deciding for yourself. Try what they're known for.",

I was quite please with the decor and how nice it was~what i liked: 1. ambiance (decor is nice) 2.

BUT...if you have about 4 people and you order a selection of things from the menu you'll like this restaurant... if you order just 1 thing off... say the grill you might be disappointed..as some did in our group.

So much flavor and so good. Okra fries are a must as well as the chicken berry Britannia. \u00a0The grilled masala prawns were good as well the chicken ruby. Let's just be honest. It was all good. As for dessert, I wasn't a fan of the memsahibs mess, but the cinnamon ice cream was pretty good. This is definitely a place I would return to. I would also recommend making a reservation well ahead as we were lucky to get in.",

    "text": "I think that this is one of the very best Indian places around town and I shall grant it with my first Yelp review. The place has never disappointed me in terms of food and quality of service. The dishes are not so big in size of portion but the value is definitely high. You pay for a well-designed space with some random decorations scattered around. They are not exactly compatible but the composition do make the restaurant look interesting and comfortable.I can make a personal recommendation on the bacon rolls. The pork belly is smooth and glistering and cooked so well that it literally melts in my mouth. However, with the pork belly being on the heavy side, the dish is just the right size so I won't get too full. That leaves a wiggle room for dessert and another chance to leaf through the menu. There's this one particular dessert that can make you shiver from the goodness - the Pineapple and Black Pepper crumble. It does sound weird but one should try it before judging it.Staff are always buzzing around and will come up always at the right time when you're ready to order up.",

Joining my co-workers and a late night food run and walked to Dishoom from our hotel which wasn't too far. Walking up to the restaurant, we were apprehensive since it was full to the brim and the waitress told us it would be a 45 minute wait. To our surprise, we only waited 15 minutes. As soon as I walked in, my senses were awaken by the spice that penetrated the air and made me more hungry than i thought i was. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share and Indian beer to drink and refresh our pallets. Needless to say, i had no idea what the dishes were called but i can't imagine there being a bad one on the dish. Even with a wait, it his worth every second. Next time i'm in the city i will most definitely make a stop at Dishoom.",

Also super good value and there are some yummy, well-made cocktails and lassis too!The only real (slight) downside is that you can't book but even though the queue is always miles long, it always moves reasonably quickly because another benefit of the yummy street food is that it is made, served and gobbled up pretty fast!",

The portions are quite generous and the hardest decision will be when to stop ordering. We were lucky to be introduced to the head chef and learnt a bit more about the menu which is a collection of favourite dishes from different regions in India \u00a0apparently there is no other place where you'd find a similar variety.We sampled a Bombay take on Pimms \u00a0a particular hit with fans of ginger beer!",

In the end, we settled on their house black daal and the paneer roll, both of which were delicious! Had we had more time on our hands, I would have loved to try some of their desserts - the group seated next to us tried them, and they all looked very good (not to mention how good their cocktails looked- also absolutely must try them next time!). Given the number of Indian restaurants in London, and the admittedly varying quality of said restaurants, finding a centrally-located, well-priced, and excellent Indian like Dishoom is something of a miracle! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",

Right from the start when they serve complimentary chai and sherry to those waiting in line, all the way through the snacks and cocktails in the waiting bar downstairs Dishoom does its best to minimize the one negative thing it has going for it which is it's insane and totally warranted popularity (you may have to flag the waitress down in the bar though, if there's one obvious thing to improve its that they should hire a second waitress, I could see quite a few people frustratedly trying to get her attention even tho she was working her butt off, there were just too many people down there). \u00a0The fried squid was far more delicious and had a spicy depth that belied the \u00a0calamari-like appearance. The ruby chicken is a little standard but very good version of chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan sopped up the spicy hot juices bringing just a glimmer of sweat to my brow. The black daal was maybe a tad dryer than I would have liked but again full of deep flavours. The paneer tikka was amongst the best I've ever had, made better by a topical spice that gave the cheese a nice saltiness. The veg up sell was totally boring however but not enough to lose a star. The highlight was the lamb chops which compared to another famous Indian lamp chop from Tayyabs comes out the winner. Finally the plain kulfi pop dessert was an amazing light and fragrant way to end the meal along with another cup of their amazing chai (which unlike many is actually really spicy)Well worth the hype!",

The server asked if it was my first time and if I had any allergies; I said I was vegetarian. She then went through and marked all the vegetarian options on the menu for me, which I didn't find necessary; I can read. But, it was a nice gesture, unless it was because she assumed I was illiterate for some reason. I ordered the okra fries as a starter. It came very quickly. It was a bit overcooked and some pieces were too stringy to chew. Then I waited a long, long time for her to come back and take the rest of my order. I debated just leaving, but the ambiance was nice and I was hungry. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wave her down but she was always rushing past. After at least 10 or 15 minutes I finally got her attention and ordered the veggie curry and basmati rice. The rice was beautiful, long-grained. It's possible I have never had proper basmati rice before. Five stars if I was just rating the rice. The curry was good, but I thought of the microwave veggie curry meals I would get from Trader Joe's, which cost 20% the price and are about 90% as satisfying. After my meal, I walked out of the restaurant past a line of maybe 20 people outside and vaguely considered myself lucky to have been seated without a wait. I also wondered why they hadn't been better about checking in on me, to get me out of there faster and clear out a table, but whatever.And also, as another reviewer pointed out, only two types of curry?! In London?!?",

I'm still thinking \u00a0about their mango lassi....The only thing I didn't like was where we got seated.. it was right by the door and hostess station. \u00a0It gets pretty packed for dinner. \u00a0I took the seat because we were tired and hungry and didn't want to wait for another table.",

    "text": "Glad we got a chance to grab lunch here before our trip to London was over. Our group ordered a lot of food and they were all pretty good. The chai tea was interesting but good. It was mildy sweet and tasted like it had ginger in it.The lamb samosas could use a little bit more flavor but I enjoyed it.The fried calamari was nice and crispy and had a sweet and spicy flavor to it. The chicken curry was spicy but rich in flavor. I love Indian curry so it's a dish I would def order again.I'm not sure of the exact name of the dish but I think it's called the chicken tikka. Love the crispy texture of the skin on the cubed pieces of chicken. It was flavored nicely and was pretty juicy. I think it's probably my favorite dish of the bunch.The spicy lamb kabob was seasoned well but I think it was a bit dry.The sheekh lamb could use a bit more flavor and was a little dry as well but I didn't mind it. My boyfriend liked it.The chef's convent garden was my my least favorite dish! I don't think anyone in my group enjoyed it either. It was actually a dip which didn't have any particular flavor to it. I probably only took one bite.The chicken pomegranate salad was nice and refreshing. Love the pomegranate seeds which gave the salad a fresh nice crunch.The ambience was enjoyable and our group had a nice time here. Glad we were able to try Indian food in London!",

It was a cold afternoon, and we had to wait outside as it was too full inside. Service was fantastic, and they bring you delicious piping hot chai to keep you nice and comfy while waiting. Lovely touch. As much as I love London, I find their service to be generally spotty at most restaurants. However, Dishoom was on point. We had servers constantly checking in on us. Always so attentive. It was wonderful. The food in itself was fantastic. I cannot even describe how delicious it was. My only regret is that we did not go back during our 10 day stay in London. If there was one meal worth repeating, it was certainly at Dishoom. Do not miss!",

And I don't even like Chai! \u00a0I hate cinnamon and I avoid Chai like the plague. \u00a0But I gave it a try since they were handing them out, and I was cold. \u00a0And boy was I glad I tried it...it hit just the right spot in the freezing weather, and I went back for 4 more glasses. \u00a0If it weren't because we had afternoon tea afterwards, I would've gotten a Chai for takeaway at the end of our meal. On to the food...it was only my husband and I, so we couldn't order too much food / carb knowing that we were having afternoon tea within a couple hours. \u00a0We had lamb samosas, roti, chicken ruby, and chicken tikka (a dry dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly and so tender). \u00a0And all were delicious! \u00a0I especially loved the sauce in the chicken ruby, it went perfectly with the roti. \u00a0For next time, I definitely want to re-order the chicken ruby, but also try the biryani and rice. \u00a0And can't forget the Chai......mmmmm.",

The wait staff was awesome helping us sift through the menu and making the right choices. EVERYTHING we had was delicious. The garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka, lamb...it was all perfect. We enjoyed our dinner so much that we returned two days later for a late lunch. That's saying something considering all the restaurant choices in the area.",

However this was overestimated for us since a few tables before us left. \u00a0The wait starts outside where we were served water and house chai as we waited in line. \u00a0After 25min, we were given a buzzer and was told we could continue our wait at the bar downstairs. \u00a0I ordered a mango Lassi as we waited another 15 for our table. \u00a0Highly recommend the mango lassi.Once we sat down, we ordered the pau bhaji for apps; black house daal, ruby chicken, chicken biryani, and Naan for entrees; and finished with the pistachio kulfi and gola ice for dessert. \u00a0Pau Bhaji - seasoned mashed veggies with two buttered buns. \u00a0I know what you're thinking, that mashed veggies sound a lot like gerber's baby food, but this was on a whole nother spectrum. \u00a0It's all spiced up and tastes like dense curry that's spreadable on the buns. \u00a0Delicious - it reminds me of the the street food of Mumbai, except I wasn't afraid of getting food poisoning this time around.Ruby Chicken - \u00a0think chicken tikki masala or murgh makhani, it's the red based curry with grilled chicken chunks. \u00a0Everyone raves about this dish and for good reason, it was the clear winner of our table too; silky smooth sauce with perfectly tender chicken. \u00a0I wish we ordered this twice.Black House Daal - lentils and/or beans that are boiled overnight, it's a cream like dish with soft lentils/beans (although I think Dishoom only used lentils). \u00a0We could have skipped this. \u00a0I was lured in by other reviews, but for us, it tasted like beans cooked in butter and we wished we ordered something else. Chicken Biryani - seasoned rice dish that is normally cooked in a clay pot, it's like the fried rice of Indian food. \u00a0We loved this dish as well, the chicken was succulent and the we didn't have to order a side rice since there was plenty in this dish. \u00a0We dipped the chicken in our remaining ruby sauce and ate the rice with our other plates.Pistachio Kulfi - creamy frozen yogurt that is magical. \u00a0Leave room for one of these!Kala Khatta Gola Ice - this is a really bizarre frozen ice dessert. \u00a0It's a snowcone with the weirdest syrup you'll ever have. \u00a0I really enjoyed it because it reminds me of salted plum drinks my mom used to make me, so if that doesn't sound appetizing, I would avoid it. \u00a0My fiancee thought it was WAY too salty, but I grew up with the flavors and highly enjoyed it. \u00a0 It's salty, sour, tangy, and peppery. \u00a0Overall we are incredibly satisfied we made this our Indian place to go to in London. \u00a0The wait was worth it!",

Very delicious actually. I can't say anything bad actually.The house chai was extremely rich, intense and tasty - oh, and it is bottomless too. My breakfast lassi was freshly prepared with a cold and creamy consistency. Spot on.Finally my house granola was delicious also. The housemade granola was crunchy and buttery, while the vanilla yoghurt tasted good too. Fresh fruit was actually - and always surprisingly - fresh and sweet.I can't wait to come back.

    "text": "Dishoom is a tribute to Hindi movies made in the Mumbai (Bombay) film industry also known as Bollywood. Dishoom is actually the sound effect one heard during the fight scenes in old Bollywood films when the good 'uns and the baddies used to punch each other to oblivion (or until the very competent police finally arrived).We were booked at Dishoom for NYE dinner by my wife's uncle and aunt. We were told that on any other day you need to queue up (even upto 45 minutes), just to get in and then you wait again to be seated at a table (another 45 minutes, possibly).Given the occasion, there was a set menu, one each for vegetarians and meat eaters. The menu I've uploaded is the meat one.On arrival we were given a glass of complementary prosecco each. Starters were based on traditional Bombay street food. We had pav bhaji (spicy-tangy potato based curry \u00a0with buns), the meat version with mince lamb, paneer tikka, fried okras and grilled prawns.The mains consisted of chicken biryani, vegetable biryani as the rice dishes. These appeared to be dum biryanis. The dum pukht method of cooking biryanis is one in which the rice and meat/vegetable are layered with each other in a pot and slow cooked. Before cooking, however, the pot is tightly sealed in order to retain the aromas.In addition to the biryanis, we also had naan breads and rumali rotis. Rumal, in hindi means a very thin handkerchief. Rumali rotis are made that thin and it takes a lot of skill to make these by hand.We also had dal makhanis (black gram cooked in a creamy sauce) and malai koftas (deep fried vegetable-cheese balls in a creamy sauce).Oh, before I forget, we also had tandoori grilled lamb on the bone.All the mains were very, very well prepared and presented, but the chicken biryani, I felt lacked that spicy grunt, which one expects in a dum biryani.For dessert we had what they called a Gujju chocolate mousse. Gujju is the friendly slag term we Indians use for Gujaratis, who, by the way make some amazing sweets and desserts. The mousse, however was a big disappointment as it didn't feel very gujju.We also had masala chai (traditional north indian tea with ginger, cardamom and spices, with a hint of sugar). The chai was fantastic!I am allergic to things that swim. Fish, prawns, mussels, shell fish, you name it. Since some of the dishes on the meat menu were fish based the restaurant offered me a veggie menu and very kindly told me they won't charge extra for any meat dishes I may want to order from the set menu, especially given that the set menu was priced around \u00a350 per person. This, I felt was a great gesture on their part.However only 4 stars this time as the chicken biryani did not feel up to scratch and the chocolate mousse didn't feel very Gujju at all.I enjoyed the experience of dining at Dishoom and thoroughly recommend it.As with everywhere else, I hope they maintain their quality of cooking and levels of service.",

Forget the heavy handed kormas, curries and oily naans etc. Dishoom does Indian food justice and does it damned good! I've been here for both breakfast and dinner, and they're among some of the best you can get in London. If you can book in advance, DO IT, because the queues here can get ridiculously long with several hour waits if you're really that keen. But is it worth it? Yes. \u00a35/6 for an absolutely incredible bacon or naan roll? \u00a32.50 for bottomless chai? Brunch sorted for under \u00a310, and get a stamp on a loyalty card giving you free brunch after only 5 stamps!Dinner wise? Go with a bunch of mates and just order everything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. Personal favourites are the pau buns - so soft and buttery! Definitely a highlight of the London dining scene for me, and has even converted some of my curry hating friends to the light!",

The food is pretty good, admittedly, I can't fault it, there are better Indians in London (lots) and cheaper, but you're not here for the food, you're here for the decor (be honest with yourself on this one if you're currently disagreeing) which is brilliant, really well thought out, and the place has a great ambiance, if you were to walk in, get a table and eat, it would be 4 stars straight away. Even a half hour wait at the bar would be fine. But who the fuck are you kidding when you're expected the queue outside to get in to the bar to wait 2 HOURS for a table. Are they having a fucking laugh? There are seemingly a lot of idiots willing to do this. There are far too many good restaurants in London to justify that wait ever. Let alone at 5pm on a Sunday. On top of this the bar is pretty poor, the cocktails are all done on theme, and most favour throwing in overpowering flavours for the sake of sounding exotic. Classics are neglected, the negroni was pretty lacklustre and pointlessly on some different teir of cocktails that you pour yourself (thanks, my own bottle!) if you're going to make people wait in your bar for 2 hours, make it a decent bar.",

Loved the food, it was fresh, looked fantastic. We actually loved it so much that I had to go back to this place the next day. We tried the one in Covent Garden this time and again the food was great. We got biryani and vada pav, both tasting authentic. The pickled mirchi which came with the chana was outstanding. The lines were really long and the service was a bit slow but overall, good experience. Definitely try it out!",

The dishes were a lot less sauce-y than more typical Indian restaurants I've been to. The standout on the menu for me was the Dishoom calamari, which was absolutely amazing. Black house daal and the chicken berry brittania biryani were good as well. The garlic naan was a bit butterier than I would have preferred, but that's just a personal preference. The restaurant is obviously very popular and we went waited for about 45-60 minutes for a table on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm. No complaints though-it was worth the wait.",

The black dahl is a MUST as are the gunpowder potatoes.I hear the cocktails are great, though haven't tried them myself.If you like coke and want something similar you wont find anywhere else in London then buy a thumbs up. Think masala cola...???...The only reason that this place doesn't get 5* is the disappointing lack of vegetarian mains. I really wanted to give Dishoom \u00a05* but there just aren't that many options. The veggy mains I've tried didn't rock my world. The Tikka Panneer was dry and rubbery. Very sad. Ah well, if you stay away from that it's all delicious! I would certainly recommend Dishoom to a friend. A really great, interesting and not too expensive place to eat. Just tell them if they're veggy to stick to the small dishes.",

    "text": "Hands-down, the BEST food we've ever had in London! We liked it so much that we went back 2 nights in a row. Here's our breakdown:SERVICE: SO great! We waited in line outside, about 45 minutes each night and both nights were impressed with the service. The hostess came around while we were in line outside with different drinks for all of us patiently waiting. We got mint tea, sherry, and chai tea. Everyone we interacted with was super nice and gave great recommendations for the food. The servers and hostesses just seemed very gracious in our waiting in line and were all very kind in demeanor. FOOD: Freakin' delicious! Actual flavor CAN be found in London! Here's what we tried over our 2 nights here:-Far Far: light and yummy snack chips that are fun and colorful and went great with the 3 sauces they bring to the table!-Chili Cheese Toast: a nice twist to regular toast with a little kick of spice mixed in with cheese. Very tasty!-Okra Fries: We had never tried okra and these were delicious all nice and fried-Pau Bhaji: tasty vegetable mash good to be swapped up with bread, but our least favorite dish.-Keema Pau: VERY good lamp/pea mashup also served with bread that comes so full of flavor your mouth is just in awe, but then you squirt some lemon on it and BOOM; you can't even believe it's better.-Murgh Malai: Super tender and flavorful chicken!!-Dishoom Chicken Tikka: another very tender and flavorful chicken in a happy mix of spices-Gunpowder Potatoes: good and a large amount we couldn't even finish it. Great white sauce that is served with them go well with pretty much anything else you order as well.-Spicy Lamb Chops: Very tender and delicious and accented marvelously by pomegranates. So good it almost tasted like beef!-Masala Prawns: Such delicious and plump shrimp in great flavor and comes even more to life with lime too.-Garlic Naan: Good solid naan; can't go wrong.-Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: Good but a little weird because it has chili in the chocolate but not terrible. I personally wouldn't order it again. Chocolate is very moist and rich.-Pistachio Kulfi: One of the best ice cream popsicles I've ever had. It's like super creamy condensed milk with a light pistachio flavor; perfect!All in all, come here and stuff your face. Will be our #1 spot to go to when in London!",

Their food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and if I were local, I would eat here all the time (on one short vacation, we dined here 3 times in 2 days). London prides itself on its Indian food, but the Indian food I've usually eaten had tastes a little different from what you get in restaurants in the U.S. or India. I've come to think of it as its own category: \"London Indian\" (sort of like \"Indian Chinese\" or \"American Chinese\" food). Dishoom's food is incredibly Mumbai-authentic (from the chai to the the oh-so-delicious chutneys), executed with really high quality ingredients. In particular, I'd recommend the jackfruit biryani (rice casserole with raisins and cooked jackfruit -- a vegetarian alternative to chicken... it looks like chicken but tastes sort of like artichoke hearts). The tikka chicken wrap was amazingly delicious (actually, the balance of flavors wrapped in that thin, papery roti reminded me of mooshu chicken), and my Indian husband declared the bhel puri the best he'd had outside of India. The line for lunch and dinner can get very long (45 minutes for lunch or just over an hour for dinner), so try to come a little early (just before noon for lunch) or make a reservation.",

When we arrived, the line was LONG. I live in a small town without any lines, so having a 1.5+ hour wait was difficult for me. They did serve us complimentary chai tea & ginger milk, which was nice. Once we got to the front of the line, we were sent into the restaurant and directed to the bar downstairs to a separate waiting area. We got drinks--which were great; lots of options--and then when our table was ready, we were brought to have our dinner. The waitress was extremely helpful and gave great advice as to what we should order. We ended up choosing several of her suggestions, and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. The naan, the lamb, the chicken, the vegetables--it was all incredible. In addition to the excellent food, I also want to note that the restaurant was EXTREMELY well-organized. Going from staff member to staff member on our way to ultimately sitting down to dinner, everyone knew exactly what was going on, and they were very professional and respectful. There's a reason this restaurant is so highly reviewed: These people know how to run a business!",

Once a table is open someone comes down to the bar to bring you back up and get you seated.The food is absolutely delicious. After eating \"traditional food\" for two days I would've killed to have something with spice on it and this place delivered.I'm sure everyone's covered how good the food is compared to what else is available in the city. So aside from that I just want to say the staff here is absolutely awesome. It was a great experience and I'd happily come back.",

My friend and I stood in line for a half hour, but I came in knowing there'd be a long queue. The staff knew too, and were equipped with complimentary sherry and chai tea for the guests in the queue. We were led downstairs to the bar where we ordered drinks first. My friend got an old fashioned and I had a blended orange drink. We were both very satisfied with our choices! Soon we were led to our table and we ordered a bunch of food- lamb biryani, ruby chicken curry, house black daahl, garlic naan, roti, okra fries with incredible dipping sauce and a side of basmati rice. Oh my god. So good. Everything was absolutely amazing. I wouldn't change a thing the next time we come to Dishoom, the curries were rich and flavorful, the lamb biryani was excellent, the lamb was SO tender, the daahl was the perfect balance between the two. Truly an experience and I can't wait to come back!!",

    "text": "We came here based on the Yelp reviews. Being a friday evening, there was a large crowd gathered outside which is always a good sign. We didn't have reservations and we were told the wait would be an hour. However, it ended up being far shorter (maybe 30 min?) and time passed by quickly as we made small talk with other customers. They serve complimentary drink samplers which are delicious while you wait for your table.The place is extremely clean and the decor is modern eclectic, lighting is a bit too focused, like spotlights on you, rather than ambiance lighting. it gets pretty loud in the rooms but not annoyingly so. Service is very good though the busy night left the hosts a bit frantic. We started with the Far Far, a crispy appetizer with spicy sauces. Delicious and my favorite dish. A crispy treat with a nice spicy kick to it. Next came the Bada Pau, a potato mash on dinner bun, which I enjoyed as well though my wife didn't. The potato was well prepared though my wife felt that it wasn't nothing special. The Spicy Lamb Chops followed. This was the most disappointing dish for us both. The meat was overcooked which made it dry and a bit too fatty. I understand that the fat is likely left on to keep the meat moist but they still missed the mark on this one. The Black Daal, a lentil based dish, was my wife's favorite. She enjoyed the perfect creamy consistency and felt that it was seasoned perfectly. She felt that it was perfectly paired up with the Garlic Naan. On the other hand, I felt that it was lacking in flavor and was a bit too watery. The Roti was a bit too rubbery and lacking the toasted softness that is typical of a good roti. All in all, I was left disappointed while my wife was a bit less so but commented that she would return to explore the menu more.",

The kids thought it was near the top of the Indian places we've tried and we would agree. We were a bit daunted by the line running out the front door and down the block (especially with 2 hungry kids in tow) but we stuck it out--and we are really glad we did!While waiting someone came and took our name and number of people, then someone else came and gave us free sample of their chai tea drink. A nice touch that made the wait easier to bear. After about 50 minutes we were seated. The whole process was very well organized and everyone was very friendly both during the wait and during dinner, often checking to see how we were doing. Highly recommend even if you have to wait.",

Their naan's are made to perfection; soft with a slight crisp and no need to chew for 10 mins before you can move on to the next bite!The Tipples (cocktails) are genius! I had a Bhang lassi and if you're of the Indian kind you'll just have had a Scooby \"huuuuh\" moment. It's lassi with a generous amount of Rum and garnished with mukwaas! Delish!I cannot wait to their breakfast menu one of these days and i'll definitely be visiting again....this month in fact!",

While you are awaiting, \u00a0you can hang out at the bar downstairs where they have Indian inspired cocktails.My friend ordered the Boybam Pina Colada which was okay. It just tasted heavily of coconut milk and some 'Indian' spices. That being said, the atmosphere was lovely, the decor is very classy and the lighting makes for a great vibe. We ordered the samosas to start which were \u00a34.00 a portion. Not. Worth. It. They are the packaged kind that you can get at any Sainsbury's or Tescos so avoid them if you can. The papadoms are delicious as is the naan bread. The curry is mediocre. Nothing you can't / won't get at a local Indian delivery place. In summation, go for the vibe but not the flavour.",

There is always a queue but it is certainly worth the wait.I'm sad they don't have the Rajma Frankie on the menu more (or maybe they'll rotate it back on) but the food here is always flavorful and delicious. The dal makhni is by far in my top 2 dals I've had ever had - second only to a place in Jaipur. Dishoom has some of the best roomali roti hands down. Whether you have it with your frankie or with another menu item, you can't miss out. I'm personally a fan of the dal (mentioned earlier), the frankies, pau bhaji, the chai and the kulfis. Every time I'm in London, I look forward to going to Dishoom (and will go out of my way to do so). The service here is always great and they do their best to get you seated as quickly as possible. I love the modern but also classic Bollywood decor, which gives this place great personality. If you live in London and you haven't been to Dishoom, what have you been doing?",

So, for those of you discouraged by the crowd gathered outside, fear not. Granted we had a party of two.Food here was relatively cheap for the quality. I got the chicken ruby, which was tender and spicy, but not overly so. The sauce was delicious and I dipped my garlic naan in it after I was done with the chicken. The naan was soft, but may be too thin for some people. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He shared some stories with us, which would usually be annoying but he was just a genuinely nice guy. He brought us raika for free to the table, which was creamy and tangy and paired well with the lamb biryani my mother got.Overall a great experience!!",

Thx to my fellow yelpers, we ordered the black daal with prawns, ruby chicken and pau bauji. The ruby chicken was definitely my favorite. But all 3 were very flavorful, and the staff was very nice. Make a reso to avoid the long line. We didn't have a reso and arrived with an hour and half wait... No one left with this long line so we figured it must be good. TOTALLY WORTH IT! it was cold out and the hostess brought out chai teas for ppl in line, I thought that was a nice touch. You stand in line outside and then you get sent to the bar before you are sat down. Must try though, If you're craving for Indian food",

We ordered lamb samosas (good - comes with 4 pieces), house black daal (highly recommend), garlic naan (too burnt), Kachi lamb (very good), chicken ruby (good), mango lassi (okay - I probably wouldn't get it again because it was a bit bland), mint tea (I would not recommend because there were not enough mint leaves or did not steep long enough. It lacked a lot of flavor) and strawberry desert (very good if you like cream and strawberries. It was not very sweet, so it was perfect! ). Overall, the restaurant was a very good experience!",

The okra fries were addictive and wonderful - and I hate okra.For dinner, we opted to share a bunch of plates. We got the lentils, ruby chicken, and keema pau. The keema pau was superb.

The fourteen of us ordered three plates of each of chicken tikka, grilled prawns, veggie curry and a few other things. Everything was simple but solidly done. I particularly liked the chicken tikka masala and the grilled prawns. The former was just perfectly spicy to fit my taste, and the latter was flavourful despite the simplicity of seasoning. For drinks, I got chai then black coffee for desserts. Apparently, the chai here is highly recommended; I liked it but not being a chai expert, didn't really see what was so stand out about it. Finally, the staff was friendly overall and prompt in service.Make sure you book in advance if you're more than a party of six. If not, I heard you need to walk in, so leave time for some extensive queues.",

The queue beat me. I arrived and we had a 45 minute wait.Luckily the brought out chai and mint teas and we probably only queued about 30 mins until we were seated at the bar to wait for a little bit longer.We ordered lovely cocktails and were soon taken to our table.Our waiter Joseph was really lovely, helpful and attentive. Dishoom is all about sharing dishes so we ordered keema pau, chicken ruby, black Dahl, lamb kebab, roti and rice. It was all delicious, plentiful and wonderfully flavoured. We all tucked in and thoroughly enjoyed our delicious dishes.We treated ourselves to sharing a gooey chocolate dessert which came with a scoop of chilli vanilla ice cream. A wonderful, naughty end to the meal. We paid about \u00a322 each for dinner and a cocktail each, which is really good value for a great meal in London. And our waiter even took our friends mocks ail when he noticed she hadn't drunk it cos she didn't really like the taste, which is fab service.Get yourself to Dishoom pronto.

Besides that, the service was great. I would suggest making a reservation if you don't want to wait in line for an hour but, if you do decide to wait they serve you complimentary hot/cold drinks. They also allow you to sit at the bar for small snacks and drinks while you wait for a table. Overall, a great experience, no complaints, and I wish I lived closer to London!",

However, they offered us drinks in line (chai, etc) which was super great and convenient and complimentary.We ordered some drinks and samosas which came out so timely. The samosas were delicious and the chutneys were just the perfect kick. We ordered the dishoom chicken tikka, and honestly if you love chicken that's the dish to get. There is no curry with it so I would recommend a naan with it. But it was the perfect amount of spices tied with the perfect texture. Finally, we finished off with some kulfi (mango and malai) and it wasn't too sweet, but just the right amount.I recommend anyone who is in the area to try this place, you won't regret it!",

Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM. So i ll go thru pros and consPROS- ambience is amazing. The lighting the old indians photos were superb touchThe cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience. \u00a0I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada. So no issues there. Service was great. All employees were friendly. \u00a0To the food. Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill. Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as neededMattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say.Cons- spicy lamb chops, first werent spicy and second they were overcooked. Cmon man there should be some red. We also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man. \u00a0I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I wouldnt even say they were prawns. It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations. My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old. To summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag .. yea not here. I mean im torn, i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise. Go enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself",

Dishoom was one of the highlights of my trip to London and, the food and service I received were worth the long lines.As everyone else is saying, I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. I came a little before 6:00 pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes - mind you, I was by myself. The waitresses will also provide you with a little hot drink (chai tea?) while you wait outside. Good thing some fellow Americans were also waiting in line; they told me what to try and order as I had no idea what to get. They recommended me the Chicken Ruby with some Naan and a side of Basmati Rice. I also ordered a delicious and sweet Mango & Fennel Lassi. Everything was tasty. The Chicken was flavorful, rich, and deliciously spiced. The Naan and Rice complemented the Chicken and the sauce perfectly. Oh, and the dips...! Amazing. For 1 person, that was a lot of food. Plus, the service was exceptional. Would I recommend it? Of course. If you're visiting London for the first time, Dishoom is definitely a place to try!",

With hype comes the slight chance of disappointment if it doesn't deliver, but guys, the Dishoom hype is real! We ordered the ruby chicken, which by the way, was so good we ordered two! It was basically a flavor explosion of zesty tomato and coconut creaminess. We paired that with cheese naan which you should absolutely order. We finished that off with the okra fries ( which I would trade for French fries any day, and that's saying a lot!). The entire meal at Dishoom was so memorable that I still dream about it from time to time :)",

    "text": "If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Came upon this place through a recommendation and was very pleased to have the opportunity to check it out. Went for a late dinner and arrived around 9:25pm. Even at that hour there was a line 30 minutes deep, but the wait didn't seem so bad as the friendly staff handed out complimentary fruit (grapes and dates) and drinks (chai and mint teas). Upon getting to the front of the line, you are given a buzzer and directed downstairs to the bar, where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait. Got the Bollybellini, a tasty fruity concoction, and waited no more than a few moments until the host seated us. They were more than accommodating when my companion and I wanted to switch to a different (read: bigger) table.Our server Ali was as friendly as could be and even gave us some great recommendations/suggestions. Between us two, we got the vegetable samosas to start (which we ended up getting an extra order of halfway through our meal -- yes, it was THAT good!) along with the Dishoom chicken tikka, spicy lamb chops, Butter-Bhatta, the Black House Daal, garlic naan, and steamed basmati rice. I could have just gotten the Daal with basmati rice and I would have been a happy camper, tbh. But really, everything was delicious and very flavorful! The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic flavor, but other than that, everything was superb! Aside from the great food and very attentive, helpful and friendly staff, the prices are reasonable. I would note that this place is more on the trendy side and the size of the dishes are similar to tapas style. Would definitely come back here the next time I'm in London! Already itching to try the Chicken Ruby and the Mahi Tikka. Again, Ali was an amazing server if you're lucky to get him, and really the whole staff was just top notch!!",

Definitely a crowd favorite this one. At least I can say I've eaten Indian food while in London. But then again, I do believe I've eaten my fair share of really, really great Indian dishes in my neck of the woods (that is, Phoenix, Arizona). Go figure. This is a nice place to take your date to, but Iimagine you'd be good enough to look for better, less expensive Indian places soon after that first date (if you and your companion hit it off and both appreciate Indian food at its best).",

    "text": "My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day. \u00a0We arrived just before noon. \u00a0We did not have a reservation, but the hostess said that was no problem. \u00a0She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people, but said she would need it back by 1:30. \u00a0This was not an issue for us, but it did seem a bit odd. \u00a0I've only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time, but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked, so although in one sense it bothered me, in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because, dang this place must be good. \u00a0For drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito, no alcohol. \u00a0I was debating between a chai and a lassi. \u00a0I love both, but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives. \u00a0However, there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink. \u00a0When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi, I knew I had to have it. \u00a0To be honest, it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal. \u00a0It was heavenly. \u00a0It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses, but it did sort of fill me up. \u00a0For entree my husband ordered the lamb chops. \u00a0He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding, but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible. \u00a0I'm not super into red meat right now. \u00a0My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat, \u00a0but they did look gorgeous. \u00a0I ordered the chicken ruby. \u00a0Here's my issue, it was one of only 2 curries on the menu. \u00a0I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries, and tandoori, and biriyani, but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection. \u00a0There was no korma, xacuti, vindaloo, madras, etc. \u00a0For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer. \u00a0The chicken ruby was very good, but far from the best I've ever had. \u00a0It tasted like butter chicken to me. \u00a0The spicy flavor didn't kick in until the very last minute. \u00a0I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine, but in no way special, and roti, which again was fine, but not special. \u00a0With his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster. \u00a0These were far from the best lentils we've ever had. \u00a0The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too. \u00a0We sat upstairs and I am glad we did. \u00a0When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant. \u00a0It was loud, crowded and cramped. \u00a0The upstairs was a bit like that, but not to that extent. \u00a0Finally, the prices were a bit steep as well. \u00a0After, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London, so it is pretty pricey. \u00a0We definitely enjoyed it, but I don't think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait, I am going to have to politely disagree. \u00a0Again, it is good, but it is not outstanding. \u00a0Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India. \u00a0I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn't really meet them.",

    "text": "I didn't think Indian food would one of my favorite meals in London, but it was! Dishoom is London's first Bombay cafe, and it lives up to the hype.My friends and I arrived around Dishoom on an afternoon around 2 PM, and luckily, we only had to wait about 30 minutes.We ordered the following:- Pau Bhaji (mashed vegetables with pau buns) - This was our appetizer to start, and it was delicious! It was flavorful with a slightly spicy kick, and it came with hot buttered buns to dip in the mashed veggies. - Spicy lamb chops - Deliciously spiced and well-cooked! The lamb was tender yet crispy on the edges, and it didn't taste gamey at all to me!- Dishoom Chicken Tikka - Chicken tikka is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so we had to try this. It was a little sweeter than I expected, but still good nonetheless. - House black daal - This was like a thick and hearty lentil soup. Creamy with great flavors. - Plain naan, garlic naan, cheese naan - Naan is a MUST at any Indian restaurant. They were all good, though the cheese was interesting since it's not a traditional naan flavor. I do wish the garlic naan tasted more garlicky and the cheese naan had more cheese though. - Roomali roti - The roti was recommended to us to pair with the chicken. I didn't think the roti was anything too special though. Texture-wise, it was like a super thin tortilla. I preferred pairing all the dishes with the naan.- Yogurt - Another recommendation from the waiter. This helped cut some of the intensity of the otherwise strong flavors of the other dish, so I thought it was a nice balance.- House sauces - The waiter brought out 3 house chutneys/dipping sauces (tamarind, mint, sweet chili?), which were delicious. The chili one paired REALLY well with the naan and other dishes - so much so that was had to ask for more!We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch to share (a bowl of jaggery, lime, Darjeeling tea and Ceylon Arrack), and it was amazing! It may be a bit dangerous, since it tastes so good and refreshing that you might just forget it's alcoholic. Our waiter actually forgot to put our order in until we asked halfway through our meal. By the time we got it, we were almost done eating, we so just sat there a while sipping some \"punch.\" Overall, it was a fun, delicious, and flavorful meal with great ambiance and excellent service too! If you're in the area, I'd recommend having a meal here!",

My fianc\u00e9 is not a fan of Indian food so that was another reason we didn't come here for dinner. We did walk by on a Friday night and there was a queue to get in and it seemed like quite a long one. Anyway, I ordered a chocolate chai since it was a little brisk this morning. It was perfectly warm and it had all the aromas that you would look for in a chai... if drinks could give you a warm fuzzy hug, this drink would be the one to do it. For our meals, we went with the naan wraps with egg. I got the sausage one and he got bacon (extra crispy). While it was good, it was not anything to write home to. His bacon was not crispy to start with - maybe some burnt edges. I gave him half of my sausage naan roll and I got half of his bacon naan roll. I want to come back here for dinner one day as I really enjoy Indian food. In the meantime, I will have to convince Brian's tastebuds that they like Indian food.",

They were right about the restaurant being worth the wait and about the okra! We ordered Chicken Ruby which was like chicken Tikka masala, and it was super delicious. We also ordered another curry and it was good, but not as good as the orange curry. We also ordered lamb and chicken tandoori and both were flavorful and tender without being dry. The plain and garlic naan were great to dip the curry. Overall a delicious experience, definitely recommended and definitely will return next time we are in London!",

    "text": "Our party of four came around on a Saturday at around 6, expecting a wait. The line didn't look too long but in reality, it was a 1.5 hour wait. Their waiting system is actually pretty orderly. It's like getting into a nightclub. They have ropes (non-velvet) and have people line up. I'm not sure if this is just to make it look like it's poppin', because there were quite a few empty tables inside. Maybe they were for people who made reservations (only available for groups of 6+). While you're waiting, a waitress comes around and gives you small samples of hot chai tea latte. It was a bit too sweet for me, but it was a very nice gesture, especially since it was windy and chilly that day.Finally, once you get inside the exclusive Dishoom, you'll wait about 15 more minutes while they prepare your table. That's how they get you to order a drink at the bar downstairs. So I had the Chilitini (Luksusowa vodka with pomegranate, lemon juice and chilli liqueur) and for 7.50, it was pretty inexpensive for a cocktail (compared to NYC, anyway). I really liked the flavor and the bite that the chili liquer gave it, but I wish there was a bit more vodka in it. I guess I'm just used to stronger NYC cocktails, where they don't measure out the liquor.Onto the food. Here is what we ordered:Garlic Naan - our waiter recommended two orders for four people, but I'm glad that we didn't go with his suggestion. It was very oily, so it would have been difficult for one person to eat more than a certain amount of it. Could have used more garlic.Lamb Boti Kabab (pieces of tender lamb marinated with red chilli, garlic and ginger) - the flavor was good but the lamb was pretty dry. It definitely needed some sauce with it.House Black Daal (Indian spiced lentils) - this was like a soupy bean dip. Not my favorite but it went well with the garlic naanChicken Ruby (chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce) - this was probably the star of the show, as it seems like the majority here would agree. The sauce is great (again, especially with the naan), and the chicken wasn't dry.Note - none of the 'entrees' come with any sides so you'll want to order naan or rice to go with it. The portions are on the smaller side so it's best to order a bunch of dishes and just share them. That way, you'll get to have a great variety.I don't know how packed their other locations get. I also don't know if I would wait another 1.5 hours to eat here again. But I do know that it was a great London Indian food experience.",

As visitors in London, we had to experience this popular place for ourselves and I wouldn't say I regret it at all. Best Indian/Pakistani cuisine in London hands-down. Food was delicious-perfectly seasoned, fresh and authentic. We got the \"recommended popular\" dishes- if it is your first time I'd go with their recs too. Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan, Spicy Lamb Chops and a beef/goat curry (forgot the name but ask them for the popular curry dish). All the items were exceptional and satisfying. Get these items and thank me later!Definitely worth the wait and the calories, in my opinion.",

It was a chilly November night and I waited outside in a short queue to get in. I think I waited about 30min but I heard it was worth it so I stayed. I know other reviews said that the staff came out with fresh hot chai to keep the guests warm as they wait but no chai that night. Finally inside lead to go downstairs by the bar area which I find really intimate and fun and dim. The downstairs also had a dining area versus the main floor. There at the bar, another 10-15min until they call you for the table. It was quick for me because I was dining solo.Ordered the usual mango lassi, chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, garlic naan and dessert. UFF. SO. GOOD. The staff were very attentive of me and other guests. Probably ended up spending 40 quids but I still love it! Everyone should gooo! I know I will the next time I'm in London!",

Once we were seated, our server came over to explain the menu to us a bit. Due to the combination of the noise level in the restaurant with the velocity and volume of our sever's voice, I couldn't decipher what he was saying. Our food was good. The Mahi Mahi tikka was the best. The Chicken Tikka was super spicy. The server was busy and therefore the customer service lacked. When we were finished, he cleared our plates and we advised him that we didn't want dessert. We waited 20 mins at our seats for our check. We had to track him down to ask for it. We paid cash and were waiting for our change, he took our cash and disappeared for another 10 minutes. Overall the service really killed our experience, which is why I must give this restaurant a 3/5.",

No, they do not let you put your name on the list and go for a stroll. You have to stand in the line, rain, wind or shine. They do bring you chai and sherry while you're waiting though.Once inside, the ambiance was beautiful. They have amazing Indian decor.

We had originally wanted to come for dinner, but couldn't get a a dinner reservation for any Dishoom in London! But lunch was excellent, and it's nice that they save a good chunk of their tables for walk-ins. Our server was very patient, kind, and attentive. She explained many dishes to us and gave us excellent recommendations. We ordered family style so I got to try a bit of everything. I had the:Rose & Cardamom Lassi: so good!!! Very refreshing and I loved the rose flavor. A perfect complement to all the spices. Cheese Naan: oh my gosh, so much cheesy goodness!!! The cheese was plentiful and beautifully melted and the naan had a nice moisture to it. Definitely wish we had ordered more of this.Chicken Ruby: yum!!!! This is so much less creamy and better than the chicken tikki masala I am used to getting in the States. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so delicious. Awadhi Lamb: some of my friends loved this, but It wasn't one of my favorites. The lamb flavor was a little too strong (does that even make sense?) for me.Keema Pau: same feelings as with the Awadhi--I just couldn't get behind the lamb here.Dishoom Slaw: a little too much sauce, but it was nice to have something to cool down my mouth.Bowl of Greens: greens! Yay! Simple bowls of vegetables that went well with all the sauce and meat we had.Black House Daal: people loved this dish, and they're known for making it. I personally thought it was too sweet.Okra Fries: reminded me of some Southern-fried food. A little too oily (but I always feel this way about fried vegetables), but nice to nibble on.Dishoom Calamari: this was delicious! Nice, light, a little sweet, and with the tiniest of kicks to get your senses going.Pau Bhaji: solid vegetarian dish. Loved the simple flavoring. Not as much of a fan of the bread, but that's probably because the Cheese Naan blew me away.Fantastic service, great ambiance, and very affordable prices. Can't wait to come back!",

I'll most likely come back just as a follow up as I clearly must have missed something. But $7.50 USD for a piece of naan with bacon inside seems ridiculous. My fianc\u00e9 ended up getting the Bombay omelette which was a little more filing and interesting but I was completely underwhelmed by the bacon naan wrap. I did observe other people get the bacon with egg which seems to give you a piece of naan that's twice of big. Looking back, perhaps I got the wrong item but the bacon naan is the suggested favorite on their menu.I will comment that their service was super on point though and that the atmosphere and decor were very nice and fitting.",

Had the Ruby chicken, paneer tikka, roti, garlic Nan, gunpowder potatoes and chole bhathura. Everything was pretty amazing. I personally like chewy bread and the nan was pretty chrispy but still good. I preferred the roti. Paneer tikka and chicken was amazing. The portions are absolutely perfect and my wife and I were completely stuffed and couldn't finish our meal. For dessert we tried the Kulfi and it was creamy and still good. We'll probably come back tomorrow. This is hands down the best Indian restaurant in London. I wasn't a huge fan of the other three we tried here",

    "text": "When we were planning our trip to London, I knew Indian food had to be something we ate while we were there. I looked at many places until I found Dishoom. The reviews looked promising so we chose the Covent Garden location based on preference of where we wanted to be. When we arrived we saw a long line. It was almost like the lines you see to get into a bar/nightclub. I had been warned about the lines from other reviews but was surprised by what we saw. We were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our names down and apologized for the wait. He said it was going to be an hour and half. Yes an hour and a half. But we were determined and everyone else in line seemed to be in good spirits so we got comfortable and waited. They do take reservations for parties of 6 or more. The staff offered us some chai tea and green tea to sip on while we waited. The line moved and when we made it to the front, we were greeted with another staff member who led us to the bar. From there we ordered drinks and then a staff member came and took our drinks to our table. We were taken care of by 4 people even before we sat down. The restaurant's vibe is Our server came and made recommendations. By that point, we had already decided on what we wanted because we had plenty of time to look at it. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Chicken Biryani, rice, regular naan and garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was so delicious. The food comes out family style which is typical in Indian culture. Everything was well made, flavorful, and a good amount of spice. The service was fantastic too. Like I said, from the moment we got in line until we left, we were well taken care off. Definitely worth it.",

The food is not even close to the typical restaurant Indian food. It is in fact a fusion of Indian and British influence; a fusion of flavors. Wow! We are very fortunate that we have cooks at our homes in India and in the US, so we do not usually eat outside Indian food. When one of my wife's friends suggested Dishoom, we immediately said that we did not want to eat at a restaurant. There is something sort of sacrilegious about Indians eating outside Indian food. Please don't ask me to explain why. \u00a0That's just how it is. But Dishoom blew the doors off all of our conventional thinking. We did not expect to have such a great experience. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was incredibly kind. Our waitress could not have been more hospitable. She explained all of the dishes as if we had never tried Indian food before in our lives. It was actually quite refreshing to hear someone describe our own native food in such an enthusiastic manner! All of the food she recommended was fabulous. I loved the Dishoom India Pale Ale beer. If you are in London, you MUST go to Dishoom!",

So many travelers rave about how spectacular Indian food is in London, compared to traditional \"bland\" (so they say) English food.I knew I had some research to do, because I only look for the best. With that said, Dishoom was the spot that was recommended the most.So, I get there after struggling trying to find the place. There's an intimidating line outside the door, the guy tells me it will be an hour wait. It actually took about 45 min. Good thing about the wait in line, is that they serve you delicious Chai tea.Any way, I get in and order the highly recommended, \"Ruby Chicken\" (their version of Tikka Marsala), Chicken Biryani, and a Naan with melted cheddar insided (if you're from Mexico or the U.S., no need to get this, it was good, but it's practically a quesadilla...been there, done that).Every thing was so tasty even down to the 3 sauces that accompany every meal (chutney, tamarind, and some green sauce).The staff was very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well...I sat downstairs.My advice...try it!",

Although we had to wait outside in the cold, servers brought out small glasses of chai hot chocolate. I had never been to an Indian restaurant nor tried Indian cuisine, and that was such a perfect introduction to what lied ahead. Once seated, the waitress informed us of how dishes were served family style there and went through various menu options and recommendations, which were incredibly helpful to me. I remember us ordering the chicken ruby, roti, house black daal, gunpowder potatoes, and a rice. We both found everything to be incredibly delectable! He had Indian cuisine before and stated that this was, by far, the best he has had. I fell in love. We regularly think back on this restaurant and wish there were one in Houston!

When we first got there, the place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated. We were told that the wait time was going to be 25 minutes, to us that was fine. They told us that we were Able to wait downstairs at the bar. 10 minutes later, we got a table. The server was super nice and understanding. She explained everything to us perfectly. For starters, we got lamb samosas, which comes two per portion. Super delicious and flavorful! Then we ordered the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and steamed rice. The portions itself was perfect for two people! The food was super good, delicious and flavorful!!! YOu can taste everything in the chicken ruby! Really recommend it!",

The workers are very nice, we waited about 20 min and they ushered us in to the downstairs bar area to wait outside the cold. They also served some warm chai while we were waiting in line. On to the food. Most everything was pretty good, although portions a little on the small side. We had to order two extra dishes to be satisfied. For starters we got the calamari and fried okra. The fried okra was very good, not too slimy with a nice crunch. Calamari was OK, it had a slightly sweet taste which I didn't care for.My favorite was the chicken ruby (not sure of the name). It's the only chicken curry on the menu. Flavorful with moist chicken chunks. We also got two of the grilled chicken dishes and the spicy lamb chops. The lamb had a good kick of flavor and not gamey, however for the price you only get three little chops.The one thing I did not like was the must touted black dal. It tasted like re fried beans. Same texture and almost same flavor but with an Indian spice kick. Overall it was a good experience, the service was nice and food in general was good.",

Dishoom takes the cake for perhaps the best Indian food you can have in London. Move over Roti Chai, see ta later Masala Zone. I have a new favourite and it's called Dishoom (the word Dishoom is the sound of a gun shot in Hindi).This place doesn't do reservations for parties of less than 6 people. And unfortunately, it is not only popular but in a high profile location, so there are always lines outside. Weeknights, you can expect to wait an hour during peak dining hours. Weekends is likely worse. But it is worth the wait! So, what to eat? Here are my faves so far, although I haven't tried everything on the menu yet. - Masala Prawns- Rajmah Chawal (a must!)- Daal (also a must!)- Rumali Roti (again, a must!)- Chicken Biryani- Chicken CurrySo take my advice. Don't fret the long line. Just go here and if you are like most, you will think it was worth the wait. I certainly did.",

It's got a great, crazy energy and love the decor! The husband and I shared okra fries and calamari with sauces and -- YUMM! Just the right amount of spice and so good! Then we shared the Ruby Chicken - I guess there is a God because it's the only way this dish could exist, and Lamb Boti Kabab with rice and a good helping of Roomali Roti to soak it all up with. Didn't try dessert because we wanted those spices to last forever. And the service? Right from the door it was perfection -- our waiter --OH HEY THERE ALI! - was hands down the best we've ever had -- great food guidance, amazing attention, and a quick discussion about the world political mess - what more can you ask for? \u00a0We're going back for breakfast and Ali has already guided our ordering. PLEASE OPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO!!!",

I'd heard rave reviews from friends about how 'different' and delicious their brunch was, but what I got was glorified cheese on toast with very little chilli. It was lacking flavour and not particularly inventive (or well executed).My companions both had the omelettes which were also left lacking. After waiting 40 minutes for a table it was just a bit meh. The service was pretty good but couldn't make up for \u00a0the dreary food.Maybe save this one for dinner.",

I walked 15 miles before I reached this gem!After the long and exhausting walk, I seated myself in this nice, air conditioned, and loud restaurant. First impression- very modern restaurant and very pretty. I feel like everything in the UK is 10x more prettier and hipster than America lol.We were seated within 5-10 minutes on a busy day on the main floor (there's a floor downstairs with the bathroom and very dim lighting, it's pretty awesome). We were given menus and these sauces that came in cute metal buckets. I forgot what I had ordered, but I remember that the chicken ruby, garlic naan, samosas, and basically everything was DELICIOUS. They were all pounding with flavor and I can still taste those spices lingering in my mouth! Yum.Despite the long journey I had taken to reach this destination, I can say it was well worth it. & if I ever visit London again, I will for sure have this restaurant on the top of my visiting list!",

    "text": "I don't like queuing, especially for food when I'm hungry. BUT Dishoom is worth the wait. You can't book (unless for 6+ people) so we got there before 6pm to try and beat the dinner rush a little later.We were told the wait would be about 45mins but I think it was more like half an hour. They brought out complimentary hot chai to drink too.Once at the front of the queue we were then able to go down to the bar. We ordered cocktails and just before they were brought over to us, our buzzer went off to say our table was ready. A waitress carried our drinks upstairs for us, which was a nice touch.The staff are brilliant. Our waiter for the evening was Joseph and I can't speak highly enough of him. He was friendly, polite and attentive without standing over us.We eventually chose our dishes between the four of us - keema, paneer, chicken ruby, lamb tandoori, black dhal, rice and roti. They were good size portions and I love this way of eating as you get a bit of everything. The only problem is I wanted to eat ALL the food! There were some amazing flavours of great spices without it being overpowering, there was also no nasty burn!We then had a chocolate pudding with chilli ice cream to share as we were too full for dessert but couldn't resist it. It was rich and gooey and they ice cream was different. It was creamy vanilla with a delayed little kick of chilli at the end. Very nice and went well with the chocolate.Three of us had the Bolly Bellini cocktail, which was delicious. At \u00a37.50 it's pretty standard pricing for London but it was one of the best I've had anywhere. A must get!One of my friends had a virgin cocktail and she ended up not drinking much of it. Joseph, the waiter, spotted this and asked her if she'd like something else instead and when she didn't he took her drink off the bill. Great service!I'll definitely be returning, even if I have to queue!",

    "text": "This is a very busy Indian restaurant that has efficiently streamlined their waiting-customer process. When I arrived on a weekend around 7PM (peak hour), there was a wait that they said would take 45 minutes. I decided to wait (table for 2) and they gave me one of those buzzers. I waited for 10 minutes and one of the hosts said there was room for me at the bar downstairs. I happily went down to the bar and sat down for another 10 minutes until the buzzer rang. Since I'm from the US and didn't have any cellular phone service, I was happy to use their free wifi (no password needed). If you're coming here in a group, do your best to make a reservation.Our server was attentive and the food was good. I'd say that this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to (not just in the UK) based on food quality and atmosphere. You feel like you should be dressed up (at least business casual) at this joint.I don't remember everything we ordered, but it included the house black daal (must-order), a chicken dish, garlic naan, roti, and mango lassi. Everything was pretty delicious and I don't think you can go wrong with whatever appeals to you on the menu. The only drawback about this place is the price. I guess they're popular enough to demand the amount they charge, but dang it costs like $6 USD for one piece of naan. If the naan wasn't so expensive I would for sure give this place 4 stars. Each person who wants naan/roti should get their own order because 1 order will not be enough for more than 1 person.So, I'm happy I tried some Indian food in London (since there's a large population) and this would be the place I recommend for fancy, quality Bombay food.",

I am a big fan of okra fries, house black dhaal, grilled paneer, and the masala prawns. The garlic naan is also a must. I was surprised to see that they did not have peshwari naan. The only dish that I wasn't impressed with was the vegetarian briyani.

We were impressed by the staff's efficiency in getting us seated and their communication with one another. The menu looked divine and I ordered the black daal and naan, while my friends ordered vegetable samosas, chicken ruby and a potato dish. The food arrived promptly and everything tasted absolutely fantastic. I've had daal in several places before but the daal at dishoom was some of the best I've ever had. We finished off the meal with mango kulfi, a rich, creamy mango Popsicle which was the perfect finale to a great meal. Prices are good for the quality of the food and the restaurant has a lovely ambience.",

It totally was. There was a wait when we arrived around 8 pm but we were seated within 30 minutes or so. I wanna say the menu is set up kinda like a tapas style..which can make it expensive. We ordered a pitcher of Bombay Pimm's to start and it was delicious! We ordered some naan and veggie samosas for apps, definitely recommend both. I ordered the chicken tikka and devoured each bite, especially with that fabulous yogurt sauce. I wish it was in the states so I could enjoy it whenever I wanted!",

Soft shell crab in a curry sauce was nice though a bit too salty - with some roti it went well. Chicken tikka was succulent, fresh and juicy - definitely worth a try. And dessert (chocolate mousse) was heavenly. Thing is - you mix it with the frozen yogurt yourself and a yogurt is so much healthier than heavy cream!We left the place satisfied, but not disgustingly full when you down heaps of oily curries and thick naan - but more like 'happy inside' and feeling good about ourselves.The atmosphere in this place is quite cool - sort of old school bollywood meets urban. It has dimmed light and nice music. Perfect!The service was good and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back!",

Don't worry, the staff is extremely helpful and patient in making sure that you know what you are ordering. Portions aren't that big, but for the price, it's still a great bargain. We ordered the prawn special and it was excellent. The flavors are well balanced and the prawn are fresh. We also made sure we ordered 2 naans to soak up the rest of the juices of the dish.

The chocolate chai and mint tea served to those waiting in line certainly warmed my insides. And then, the business begins. I ordered the black daal, lamb biryani, and the garlic naan. Our server thought I was ordering for my friend and I, but I just wanted to try everything! If I had the option to take leftovers home, I would've ordered the Ruby Chicken.The daal was rich, \u00a0smoky and flavorful-- perfectly partnered with the naan! You forget it doesn't have meat. The lamb biryani had a subtle, slow-burning heat. It's the kind of meal that makes you say, \"that hit the spot!\"But as delightful as dinner was, I had to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did. The kulfi was so rich and creamy, it was almost chewy. It was almost custard.If you are ever within the vicinity of this place, make sure you get in line! Build up an appetite and know it will be worth the wait!",

The service is also great!Pricing seems very fair, and the quality is wonderful. They are also quick to bring out dishes, too! Wonderful execution. We shared: -lamb samosas. YES. Just yes. So flavorful and perfect. So comforting. SO good. The sauces they provide as well are just great. -Garlic naan. Kind of cliche, but still super tasty. It was fluffy and flavorful and not TOO garlicky. Love. -Ruby chicken. This was somewhat spicy but warming and comforting and flavorful. I was super into this. -Chicken biryani. YES. JUST YES. This is so good. So flavorful and lovely and would go super well with raita. -Chai. This is next level chai. AND they give free refills! It's comforting (a theme here) and spicy in the best way. It is delightful.All in all, this is a great place and if I lived in London, I'd come here all the time. It's not the BEST Indian food I have ever had, but is ROCK solid and the whole experience is VERY nice. PS: The above dishes was a LOT to handle for 2 people. Be warned. No regrets!",

    "text": "The name Dishoom is the Indian movie equivalent of KAPOW! in superhero comics - the amplified sound (particularly in movies of 70s and 80s) when the fist of the hero connected with the face of the villain. Not sure who the villain is in this case, but the restaurant has certainly connected with the public, and now has five locations.Students of business broadly, and positioning in particular, should find Dishoom as a fascinating case study. Not simply for creating demand that no one knew existed (the Brits are unlikely to tire of the Curry House format anytime soon), but for educating and convincing people that their lives had been incomplete without it! Dishoom is more than the sum of its parts. Yes, it is a very competent and affordable restaurant for lunch and dinner, but it is also one which explicitly positioned itself as a breakfast destination, as opposed to treating it as an afterthought to cover the costs for premises. For those who don't know, this was done by intelligently leveraging human nostalgia for the past and modeling their (scalable) business after the Irani cafes in Bombay (now Mumbai) popular in the Twentieth century, but whose numbers have dwindled considerably in the last decades. As background, Irani cafes were all day cafes inspired by the European coffee houses, and were places where people from all stratas of life could lounge all day, should they so choose, engaging in activities as diverse from reading the newspaper, writing their literary masterpiece, or just taking a break from the humdrum of the office. In my minds' eye, I can visualize a room large enough to be a banquet hall, decorated with family portraits, ceiling fans blowing air to provide patrons respite from the hot and humid summer day... so you can see, you can cut the romanticism with a knife.But, here's the anomaly: the people who're seated here are basically foodies (pardon the word usage) and Indians, not necessarily mutually exclusive, with almost no one who would remember personally going to the cafes in now Mumbai. Nor would anyone confuse the patrons here for Bob Dylan (hey, he's a Nobel Prize winner now!). \u00a0Despite the meticulous set design, there's no slice of old Bombay here - but that's the magic of the positioning, as opposed to serious culinary chops, that no one pays any attention to that.Enough backdrop, the food is good (at times: excellent), but uneven with lots of misses in my 3 visits. My favorite menu items from the all day menu include the Masala Prawns, the spicy lamb chops, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Keema Pau (popular menu item at the Irani cafes). \u00a0For breakfast, I've liked the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli cheese toast) and Keema Per Eedu (chicken keema, chicken liver, fried eggs, and crisp chips). When it comes to drinks, they have quite a few innovative ones on their menu, e.g. Bhang Lassi (with/without rum) with ginger, almond syrup, yogurt, fennel sprinkles. The one I liked more was the Mango and Fennel Lassi. But, I've yet to like any dessert here, particularly iced things whether in a glass (gola ice) or a stick (kulfi). While I was tempted, I decided not to try the cream, meringue and strawberries dessert (Memsahib's mess). I saw it at a neighboring table and it certainly looked heavy enough to knock one out with a solid Dishoom...",

Dishoom! YES!Thanks to fellow Yelper's who made the decision extremely easy for what to order... Priced a bit on the expensive side for the really small portions you get... it might annoy you to find a small little bowl of Okra Fries (\u00a33.70) and Prawn Koliwada (\u00a35.90).. But have a bit of these extremely well seasoned appetizers... and ... DISHOOM! They got it spot on.. Really nice flavor and you'll definitely enjoy it!For entrees... Chicken Ruby is clearly a winner. We saw a few tables order Biryani and Choley Bhatura too; but most of them were hogging on the really delicious (albeit smaller portions) of this dish.. again, priced a bit on the steeper end at \u00a38.20. Roomali Roti's go extremely well.. so definitely recommend that!Few things to remember.. they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait! We waited ~50 minutes on a Wed night at 7:20. After we got in, they strategically send you downstairs to their bar where they'd expect you to spend a few more \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's on drinks.. in about 15 minutes, you'd be taken to your table. For a place already minting money, this was a bit unnecessary in my opinion!Service wise, no complaints! In fact, the food comes out really quick after placing your order. We got our food within 10 minutes! Definitely a must experience place for the Desi & Videsi crowd ;-)",

We had the lamb biryani (best I've ever had) paired with a light yogurt dip to cut the heat. We also has veggie samosas and fried okra. YUM. Everything was super and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food. We washed down our delicious meal with a glass of mango lassi (also terrific). If you have the chance to visit, please do. It's well worth the wait. Oh, and the WC was pretty clean, too.",

However, to be fair, this is one of the best food I had in this London trip so far....considering London is a good food desert, this restaurant to get high score is quite reasonable.",

    "text": "One of the best Indian restaurants in London (maybe one of the Indian restaurants in the world), and worth the wait! Don't come here unless you're willing to wait in line for 45-90 minutes, but on the plus side, they have space heaters outside to keep you warm, give you complementary chai, and they have free WiFi. So it could definitely be worse. I came here on a Friday night and waited in line outside for about an hour, and then moved downstairs with a buzzer where I had to wait for another 30 min or so. At least once you went inside and downstairs, you could order a drink and some appetizers, so it wasn't quite as bad. The line felt a little like DisneyWorld where you move to different waiting areas to help pass the time quicker with a change of scenery.LAMB SAMOSAS (\u00a34.90) - Delicious samosas, I don't normally like lamb but I liked these a lot. The outside was nice, flaky and light, made with phyllo dough and not heavy. There were 3 of them and they were delicious. I would recommend.OKRA FRIES - (\u00a34.20) - These were thin slices of okra cut into fries, and lightly covered with batter and spices. I like both appetizers but I liked these a touch more than the Samosas. It went well with the drinks. Would recommend these, I didn't want the bowl of these to end!AU BHAJI (\u00a34.50) - A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered pau bun. The description doesn't really do this dish justice, but it was our favorite one of the bunch. There were 2 fresh, hot, buttered rolls and a bowl of vegetables that were mashed with spices. It doesn't sound that great, but it was so good, hearty, and comforting. Don't miss this one. BLACK HOUSE DAAL (\u00a35.90) - I know this is a signature dish of lentils simmered for 24 hours, and it was good - I would definitely eat it again, but it was probably my least favorite of the bunch.CHICKEN RUBY (\u00a38.50) - The curry was well done and the chicken was cooked well - spicy, but not too spicy. Definitely worth ordering if you like curry dishes. We ate this with naan and rice, but I'm sure it would be delicious with roti.GARLIC NAAN: Fluffy, fresh, and delicious. I'd recommend getting at least one order for the table. I wanted to get the Roti also, but between the naan and rice, we had sufficient carbs for the table.DISHOOM CHOCOLATE PUDDING (\u00a36.90) - I loved this dessert a lot, but I like chocolate cake and spicy things, so the combo of a warm chocolate cake and a scoop of chili ice cream was my perfect combination. The chili ice cream is not as odd as you may think - it just has a hint of spiciness. Overall, such a fantastic meal at reasonable prices. Quality food, so many options to choose from, and even the long line was made better by being able to go downstairs and get drinks/appetizers, having free chai, and WiFi. I'd come back here on every trip to London and can't wait to have breakfast here one day. Brace yourself for the wait and make sure to add this on your list of places to eat in London.",

I've always been a fan of Indian food and thought we had some great options in LA and an occasional visit to an Indian place in Manchester or London, however this is a fresh take on the real deal. Very inventive while still embracing the authentic tastes. I ordered the Mahi Tikka along with Pau Bhaji which was just absolutely perfect. I tried sampling as much as I could without overstuffing myself. Don't skip the Paneer Roll and of course an order of Naan. Everything on the menu looked amazing. I would say its perhaps the best food I've had in London in a long time!",

The kabab were also very great however the boti and chops were my favorite.We all got full off of the starters so shared the chicken curry dish which was good too...We got seated downstairs however if you want more of an experience I would suggest to be asked to be seated upstairs.

    "text": "Oooh the chicken ruby dish here has changed the way I think about my chicken in Indian food and curries. Recently I'd been finding myself avoiding chicken at Indian restaurants (in America) because of how hard I've been finding the pieces - like solid, blocks of tough meat that became a nuisance to bite into. Even in places that people rave about, I've found chicken to be unfortunately blah after countless times.So I was a little wary to have chicken here, but I was also curious to see how it would compare. The waiter wasn't particularly helpful really, but one of the things he did list was the chicken ruby. So after some indecision, I decided on that and roti (a recommended pair on the menu), and chai tea. So worth the roughly hour-long wait in line (I arrived around 5 pm on a Wednesday). The chicken was tender and broke off easily with fork in one hand. The curry was so complex (it had a good balance of spice and it wasn't too sweet as if simply tomato soup or heavily tomato-based).The roti did pair really well with it, soaking it all up. And it was the perfect amount together, which I find rare! Initially it might look like you don't have enough of one or the other, but no worries, ends up striking a nice balance and being filling.",

    "text": "We went here for a late lunch around (1pm) on a Monday and were seated immediately. Every other day we walked passed Dishoom, there was a line out the door. The hostess told us that they only take reservations for dinner if the party is more than 6 people. Furthermore, the entire staff was extreme pleasant and helpful.The atmosphere of Dishoom is exactly what I would expect for a Bombay style cafe in London. The decor creates the feeling of a small cafe from an exotic land. The downstairs area has extra tables and a bar. We started with the House Black Daal (~5 \u00a3) and garlic naan (~2 \u00a3). The garlic naan was only two halves, which is slightly less than we expected, but the House Black Daal was amazing. It is a cream lentil based sauce that could honestly be a soup and a meal by itself. The spices were perfectly balanced to offer flavor, but was mild enough for even the most spice-adverse individuals. We also split an order of Okra Fries (~4 \u00a3). These were good and crispy, but nothing compared to the House Black Daal.For our meals, I got the Biryani Awadhi Lamb (~10 \u00a0\u00a3). The server suggested also getting an order of Raita (~2 \u00a3), a yogurt dish similar to Tzatziki sauce, to act as a palate cleanser to reduce the amount of heat from the Awadhi Lamb. The Awadhi Lamb is a bowl of rice, onions, other toppings, and tender lamb. The lamb actually pulled apart similar with just my fork. As someone that loves food in sauces, I used the remaining House Black Daal and poured it over the rice. The Raita was definitely a nice touch, as the Awadhi Lamb had a subtle spice that got hotter in my mouth as I continued to eat. My friend ordered the Chicken Rubi (~10 \u00a0\u00a3) and a side of Roti bread (~2 \u00a0\u00a3). Her chicken was extremely moist and tender and was smothered in a bowl of ruby red curry sauce. I didn't have much, but she was thoroughly pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone that like Butter Chicken or Chicken Tikka Malasa.I was already stuffed so for dessert I only ordered the Chocolate Chai Tea (~3 \u00a3). It tasted like a lightly sweetened hot chocolate with the subtle spice of chai tea. The topping was similar to an extremely light frothy steamed milked with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Definitely a must get on an colder day. My friend ordered the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble (~5 \u00a0\u00a3). It is served on this little wooden tray with the vanilla sauce on the side. I thought it was going to be overly sweet from the look of it, but I was surprised by its subtle sweetness that allowed the perfectly ripe pineapple to provide the flavor. Overall, Dishoom offer great indian food for reasonable prices. With it located near the center of London, its a great option for anyone. Also, on Mondays they play this \"game\" when you get your bill. You roll a die and if it lands on 6 your bill is covered by the restaurant! Just another incentive if the amazing food was not enough.",

The service was excellent, ambiance was great (the bar downstairs is perfect for drinks and dining), and most importantly the food was incredible! (Note: I probably butchered some spellings in this review- too busy to fact check).First, we waited 1 hour at 9pm on Saturday night. If you're not prepared to wait for good food in a major city, then don't-- but don't blame the restaurant!We ordered the lamb kebabs, chicken ruby, house black dahl, garlic naan bread, raita, and the mahi curry. It was all excellent, we'd order it all again. The okra fries were just ok- way too salty for our tastes though the dips were nice.The portions are fairly small, so order plenty of dishes and share nibbles amongst the table. Also they don't custom prepare dishes in terms of spice, so my wife found some dishes uncomfortably spicy, but it's Indian after all so can't complain about that. For drinks their house IPA is excellent and my wife really enjoyed the Bolly-Bellini.",

They're very realistic about wait times and offer cold/ hot beverages while you're waiting. Once in, the customer service continues. Knowledgeable and friendly staff offer recommendations and the vibe is really cool; good music, ambiance, and decor. The food is out of this world and very reasonably priced. Would and will go back again! Already recommended it to two friends! Ask for Gabri - great server!",

    "text": "My dinner at Dishoom was easily one of the best dining experiences of my life. Every aspect of the experience - atmosphere, service, food and drink - was excellent. We went around 7pm a Sunday night on a recent trip to the Covent Garden location, and waited a little over an hour for a table. Do not be deterred by the line outside! The hostesses offer you chai tea and a delicious lime drink while waiting in line, and allow you to wait in the bar area and grab cocktails/appetizers before your table is ready. The restaurant also just smells delicious - the whiff of spices you get as you enter the restaurant is a clear indication that your meal will be transcendent.We ordered the calamari and vegetable samosas as bar appetizers while we waited for our table. Both were delicious, very nicely flavored! For dinner, we ordered the prawn moilee, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and each of the naan varieties. We also threw in a black house daal, on recommendation from our fantastic waiter Gabri. My personal standouts were the prawn moilee and lamb chops - both perfectly cooked and just oozed with flavorful goodness.The general atmosphere was what impressed me most about Dishoom. The food and drink are extremely reasonably priced, especially considering how high quality they are. The hostesses and wait staff have service down to an art - a busy dining environment could very easily be hectic, but they go above and beyond. Thank you to Gabri and the whole Dishoom team for a supremely special and memorable meal!",

From the tables and chairs, to the wall decor and bar setup, entering this restaurant is as if you had entered a time capsule back to early twentieth century India. The menu is presented tapas style, and every dish I tired I thoroughly enjoyed! We started with the masala prawns (very large, exquisitely seasoned prawns!) and the lamb samosas (very light filo with tender pieces of lamb). Next we shared the Awadhi Lamb (again, a wonderful seasoned biryani dish) and ordered a side of Roomali Roti (this was our only disappointment, since the roti seemed a bit tough). The Dishoom Chicken Tikka Roll was also \u00a0very flavorful, and enough to share for 2! For dessert, try the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble - not too sweet and a perfect end to the meal. \u00a0The waiter was attentive, and service flawless. I only wish I lived in London to sample more of their menu! This is a restaurant you want to keep coming back to for its sheer uniqueness and top notch service!",

My breakfast didn't blow me away. So when I'm nursing a hangover, I'll pass on Dishoom. Meet me down in the British caf. And pass the brown sauce.",

    "text": "The food alone would've been 5 stars. It was probably one of the best Indian food experiences I've had. And living in Toronto, I've had my share of Indian cuisine. We got the lamb samosa to start (which literally came within 5 seconds), it was spicy and flavourful. After waiting for 10 mins for a beer and water and then 40 min for food, we started to wonder what happened. So it turns out our waitress (an american accentred girl) has forgotten to put in our order. As a result, we got a round of drinks for free. I had the thumbs up flip, it was a really good whiskey mixed drink, I wanted to learn how to make it myself, very delicious.When our food finally came (50 min after we ordered the first time), it was worth the wait. We got the special, soft-shell crab curry stew with indian style potatoes and garlic nan. The curry had a very complex yet tasty flavour, nothing like what I'm used to. The soft-shell crab was unique as well, crunchy and mushy at the same time. If you are ever in the Covert Garden or Leichester Square area, this is a great spot I think for Indian food. The decor and environment is hip but the food is pretty traditional and delicious. And even just coming for the thumbs up flip cocktail is worth it. London is an amazing city, I miss it already.",

    "text": "The food here was delicious and very reasonably priced. The inside decorum was very festive. The cocktails were on point. However, I very much doubt I will ever go back. The queue was an hour long JUST to get inside and then another forty minutes waiting at the bar for a table. It's hard to justify such a wait unless its literally the best Indian food I've ever had, which this was not. They did give us free sherry drinks and hot chai while we were waiting though.",

    "text": "Things have been looking on the up and up at this place!! This was my sisters last night in Europe and this place did not disappoint. We sat down at the bar and ordered a glass of champagne, an east india gimlet and a chaijito, all three delicious! We ordered the calamari and the far far which were served along with three types of chutneys. The calamari is probably one of the best I ever had, the far far was ok - I would spend my calories on bhel puri instead.We were seated for dinner (which was right in front of the door so the cold wind would come in often), and ordered the haleem, two sides of the greens and the house daal along with a Bollybellini. All are highly recommended. We also ordered a chai and the monsoon Malabar coffee, which were amazing. These accompanied the guju chocolate dessert, which I would say to give a miss. Service was amazing and we had a great time all in all. Great night!!",
