    "text": "'South of the river' has become a dirty phrase for many Londoners and this vast area falls outside the radar of many food writers and guides - perhaps most significantly the critical eyes of the surreptitious inspectors at Michelin. Chez Bruce then, is a lone star in a very bleak sky (with the exception of the Glasshouse at Kew), and following my first visit on Saturday, one that I'm sure will continue to shine brightly.There is a rich culinary history contained within the walls of Chez Bruce, as this was the site of Marco Pierre White's first venture 'Harveys' in the late 80s. Since 1995, Bruce Poole has kept the magic alive. The dining room is intimate and elegant, overlooking the leafy Wandsworth Common. There is no a la carte at lunch time, which I welcome in this sort of restaurant, as it tends to offer more options per course at a reasonable price.The dining room was packed when we arrived towards the end of service but front of house were very polite and attentive. We ordered a 2008 Albari\u00f1o with the help of the stand-in Sommelier which was the perfect recommendation based on our requirements. A starter of mackerel fillet with baby squid, chorizo, grape and tomato was cooked well and very refreshing if a little too sweet from the fruit. A main of saut\u00e9ed Guinea Fowl with ravioli, creamed girolles, gem lettuce and tarragon was delicious and very generous but the meat was a little over-cooked and dry as a consequence. Finally, sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream served in a brandy snap was very rich, and hardly touched the sides on the way down.The cooking here was superb but portion sizes were arguably too big. Were I not a gluttonous pig, I would have struggled to finish everything. I couldn't manage a coffee at the end which was disappointing, given the lovely looking truffles it came with. Nonetheless, I would certainly return as it was exceptional value and more pleasant than what much of 'north of the river' has to offer.",

He was fabulous, I recommend taking advantage of his knowledge and humility. He guided us towards an excellent Macon for our starters, Pork Belly and Cod with baby squid, and an Auxey Duresses 1er Cru from 2005 to accompany and assiette of lamb, and roast veal. All dishes were superb.Puddings were not as fabulous - the Creme Brulee was huge! Call me old fashioned but why not have a nice little ramekin? \u00a0It was more like a side plate and was very rich and well chilled. I had the cheese which was very well kept but I wasn't sure what to pick and felt I could have been guided a little better.Espresso was very good but pricey (\u00a33.50) but they were accompanied by delightful homemade tuffles. It was pricey, almost \u00a3200, but worth every penny. It doesn't need to cost this much and I think you could spend half and still have a great meal.I'm delighted it's a 10min stroll along the road!",

When we'd been looking at, and discussing the menu for a while, the MD came over and ask whether we would 'like to have any of the [French] words explained'. \u00a0Ouch. \u00a0When the sommelier came over to discuss the extensive wine list, we pretended that we were at least a little bit interested in food matching, and tolerated her suggesions, before eventually deciding to go for the house white after all....excruciating. \u00a0She knew, she always knew. \u00a0So, in conclusion, I would generally rather spend less to go somewhere where I feel completely comfortable and can afford a feast. \u00a0However, really glad I went, and I heartily recommend Chez Bruce if you want to try some seriously exquisite cooking.",

    "text": "It's nice to have a Michelin starred restaurant south of the river near to me. Chez Bruce is part of a group also comprising fellow starred restaurants La Trompette in Chiswick and The Glasshouse in Kew. Speaking to the waiter at Chez Bruce, the credit crunch has had an effect on some of the fellow restaurants but Chez Bruce's bookings are still holding up well.Speaking about the booking process, I have to give you a tip. Every time I've booked, I've been told that they're fully booked. However, they have a smaller room upstairs - when I've then asked whether I can have a table there, they have always said yes! They've then tried to push me for a certain time and when I've asked for the time I want, they've said yes! And on arrival, the upstairs room hasn't been full. Having said that, they're very efficient and you always get a phonecall a day ahead to check that you'll turn up for your booking.The restaurant is close to Wandsworth Common train station and I generally park in the free station car park. Inside the unassuming front door is a world of calm and wonderful service. The waiting staff have never been anything but friendly and attentive in the right amount. Never too pushy but with a helpful suggestion if required. For example, tap water is offered without a bat of an eyelid.Chez Bruce offers a \u00a340 prix fixe menu at dinner with 7/8 choices for each course. The style of food is generally good French brasserie with a changing menu depending on produce and seasonality. I am however very impressed that they do push the culinary boundaries as well. For example, last year, they did have calf's brain as a starter and I was gutted to have missed it while it was on the menu.Generally, I've enjoyed the starters and desserts with inventive and clean flavour combinations. A recent inventive starter was the duck, green bean and prosciutto salad which was served like a pancake and an example of a dessert is a pear and almond croustade which was a whole pear baked in a pyramid of filo pastry served with poire William and apple ice cream. Although always well cooked the main courses don't somtimes hit the heights of the starters and desserts, mainly when some of the flavour combinations become muddied.On paying the bill, we were given a card offering us a half price meal at The Glasshouse till the end of March.I've brought several friends from out of town to Chez Bruce. It offers a reliable and high class dining experience.",

    "text": "My favourite dining experience in London. What I like about it most is that there is no pretention, no snootiness. They have an extensive wine menu and one of the joys of going here is to ask for the wine somellier who will go through what food you are eating, what you like, and pick an incredible bottle of wine at the price you want. Don't be embarrassed to ask. I ate downstairs the first time I went there, but the second time, we sat upstairs, which I actually preferred. There are about 5 tables and it's more intimate and romantic, with views over Wandsworth Common. Slightly old-fashioned, the food is modern French and incredibly delicately done. For starters there's typically foie gras, delicate soups, or fish dishes like ceviche of tuna. Mains vary from gamey dishes like guinea fowl and rabbit, and tasty fish. All I've had were superb (sadly I've lost the menu from that wonderful night, and it changes regularly). The cheese course is wonderful \u00a0with a serious cheese platter arriving that you can pick from. Make sure you leave some room if you can. All in all, we paid around around \u00a375 each, for a 3 course meal, a bottle of wine and 2 digestifs \u00a0considering you can easily pay \u00a350 each for an OK meal in London this is incredibly reasonable. My Scottish tip is to crack open some bubbly at your flat beforehand \u00a0its always tempting to have some fizz when you get to a posh restaurant but it always hits you on the bill (or ignore me and live a little..!).",

Both delightful, particularly liked the caponata and goats cheese cigar that accompanied the lamb.Not normally a huge dessert fan but the strawberry jelly with yoghurt sorbet and black pepper brandy snaps has to be sampled.All in all it's pretty clear why this place is the best there is south of the river.",

I've been here a few times, mostly for lunch when the prices are more understandable (around 25 pounds for three courses), and am always delighted by the quality of food I get. Small but perfectly formed, with deep maroon colours and crisp table linen giving a private yet relaxed feel. Also wonderfully free of the usual hush in restaurants of this ilk. You can talk to your friends/partner without whispering! They do the usual bread rounds (and a pastry round at the end) and the exciting extras before you begin, but what really sets it apart is the simplicity and quality of the dishes \u00a0lamb cutlets with an aubergine relish or the most succulent and tender beef fillet ever \u00a0and the lack of pretension to any of it. My favourite restaurant in London. So far.",

This is one of only a handful of restaurants South of the river that has a Michelin star but don't let that dissuade you. The front of house wasn't the friendliest and the ambience/venue was understated, but the food more than made up for it. The Parmesan biscuits and bread, especially the focaccia, were excellent. For starters, we had the crispy trotter sausage served with leek and bacon fondue, quail's egg and apple sauce, which was very tasty. But the highlight has to be the foie gras and chicken liver parfait, which was rich and light at the same time. It was served with the softest, freshly toasted brioche and it was a match made in heaven! We ordered the fillet of beef and venison for mains and both were perfectly done (medium), pink and melt in the mouth. The dessert impressed as well. The pecan ice cream was just the right sweetness with crunchy pecan, balanced with the sweet \u00a0Florentines. The hot chocolate pudding with praline parfait was very rich but the parfait had melted slightly when served. The staff even made a little birthday brownie with a lit candle for a birthday celebration which was a nice touch. Overall, it was one of the best meals I've had in London and will most certainly be back.",

House white wine was just right: dry, almost ice cold. It went swimmingly with our fish main courses. The ambience isn't too stuffy, either. Sure, there're starched white tablecloths, but the dress code is smart casual, and the clientele were mainly families or friends, with a businessy pair here and there. Service was attentive, if a little slow (we were there for nearly three hours). Still, that's the luxury of enjoying a leisurely long lunch. Be warned, you will feel full. Very full. The thought of eating ever again will be nauseating. But, oh, what a treat.",

I didn't know until just now, but I am not surprised.I was in town after almost two years, so my friends brought me there to celebrate. It was four of us, so we had the chance to try different things on the menu.As starter, I tasted both the Foie gras and chicken liver parfait (which I believe it's an always on) and the Buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto and peaches.The Foie gras was really tasty and delicate I think mixing it with chicken liver made it much softer in terms of taste, which is something I prefer.The mozzarella was also good, living in US I struggle to find good fresh Italian cheese so I was very happy about the quality.As main we all took the Chateaubriand (which I believe it's another always on) and it was stunning. The meat almost melts in your mouth, I don't know how the prepare it but it's incredibly tender. The veggies it came with were also pretty good. It's probably the first time I enjoy eating the meat and the side together, as the latter enriches the taste of the protein rather than covering it.As dessert the chocolate putting was also very good. It came worm but not hot enough to melt the ice-cream, it was a great way to finish off!We got two different bottles of red and two of us took another drink, and the bill was around 100 pounds per person.Not an every-day restaurant but highly recommended for celebrations or special occasions!",

Ok, so go open one and get back to me. Nope, it didn't happen, apparently it was a new wine to the list. Well as far as I know a sommelier is supposed to taste the wines and understand them so why didn't she? She could have offered to open one right there and then and if we didn't like it then she had one to taste test but she didn't \u00a0The wines we ordered were good but no thanks to her.Appetizers were good but not outstanding.Main courses were very good and I'd definitely recommend them. However no one came to clear our plates for the longest time even though they came to pour wine. I definitely feel that basic attentiveness was lacking and certainly not Michelin star quality. Deserts were good, but again, not as good as I'd expect They were kind enough to bring me a small complimentary birthday brownie, but sadly even that was disappointing.All in all they didn't live up to all the hype from the parents and I wouldn't rush back.",

I was blown away by the fantastic service, the delicious food and accoutrements.On greeting us the waiters took our coats and showed us to a nice round table by the window. It was right by the entry area but sufficiently sheltered that the noise of the restaurant and the cold from the opening door did not disrupt our meal.A delightful young man talked us through the menu and on request gave us recommendations and his thoughts on the menu. He was poetically spoken and clearly knew the menu inside out.Following ordering he brought us breads to try- the rosemary focaccia was particularly good- though perhaps a little too salty for my taste. The walnut bread was delicious.I had the artichoke salad to start. The ingredients were fresh and paired fantastically together. It was a delight for the taste buds without leaving me feeling too stuffed for main. (My eyes are often much bigger than my stomach!)The roast cod I had for main was a true masterpiece- perfectly cooked juicy flakes of seaside joy! The truffle mash potato had great depth of flavour and the enochi mushroom sauce added another level to the dish.For pudding I opted for the intriguing apple sabl\u00e9, an invention of the chef, with bay leaf, cavlados and raisins. It was a curious mixture of autumn harvest and rich almost bacon-y goodness. I strongly recommend it!To finish I ordered a simple black coffee, not particularly expecting anything special (apparently I hadn't learnt despite the show upon show of mouthwatering goodies I'd had bestowed upon my plate). Again I was gifted with a delicious, rich but highly drinkable coffee presented with truffles and palmiers. Delicious!The whole meal and experience truly impressed me and I was thrilled to find such a fantastic restaurant so close to home! The bill set me back a fair few pennies but absolutely worth it- especially if you're taking a loved one for a momentous but understated meal. Looking forward to going again!",

The restaurant proposes every time different menus and at lunch a meal with a carafe of wine can cost around \u00a350, while tt dinner is more expensive. Obviously not exactly cheap, however, you might really experience incredibly good dishes, like the \"pappardelle with duck ragu'\" that I tasted last time. Delicious. Personal is nice and discrete, portions are not huge, but the combination of the three courses proposed, plus the offer of several (very good) breads and biscuits does satisfy you also in terms of quantity.

    "text": "Sometimes if you wait too long for something it simply doesn't have a chance to live up to your expectations. Chez Bruce, I waited a long time and unfortunately you fell slightly short. But let me explain...So, along with hubby I took my parents for a meal one Saturday night. A generous wedding present from work helped fund the majority of our food at \u00a340 a head for the three course menu. I think I chose pretty well, as my tuna starter was beautifully cooked and started the meal off perfectly. Husband being a foie gras aficionado opted for said dish and was greeted with something that looked particularly average and unfortunately not really anything to shout about. The fresh foie gras that came with my duck however was amazing and was a highlight of a slightly interesting asian inspired duck dish. My desert of a salted caramel was a delight too. And all in all the three courses were perfectly balanced, if (only ever so slightly) on the small size. So, three stars. Yes, well we were seated upstairs, with just four other tables and no background music whatsoever. I know posh places don't really go in for the whole 'muzak' thing, but it really felt like we were eating in someone's living room and that we'd all happened to have been thrown together. Each table carefully eyeing the other up and keeping our voices slightly below the usual level for fear of disturbing our immediate new dining friends.Service was perhaps a bit overly fussy and lacking in real warmth from both ma\u00eetre de and waitress.So, is it worth it? I'd say there are better michelin starred restaurants around and maybe, just maybe, old Chez Bruce is starting to look a little dated. And maybe I was just a few years too late.",

    "text": "No doubt one of the best dining experiences I've had since moving to London. \u00a0The \u00a320 set menu (if booked on toptable) was extremely good value with a wide selection to chose from. \u00a0Their signature starter - the foie gras parfait was a little strange at first with the presentation but it the consistency was delightful and couldn't have tasted any better. \u00a0As a main, I ordered the pork variety dish with sauerkraut which was perfectly enjoyed with the cold weather and snow. \u00a0Finished off the meal with a hot chocolate cake which melted in your mouth. \u00a0It was nice and cozy with lovely view of the common. \u00a0Highly highly recommend.",

    "text": "The restaurant was about a 35 min cab ride from my hotel, but totally worth the trek! \u00a0The neighborhood that was equivalent to Manhattan's Williamsburg.My appetizer was crab with warm artichoke barigoule and herb gnocchi. \u00a0For the entr\u00e9e, Roasted cod with olive oil mashed, grilled courgette, and gremolata. \u00a0Desert was a muscovado custard with cr\u00e8me fraiche ice cream and roasted macadamia nuts. \u00a0A magnificent meal!!! \u00a0Service and decor a 10! \u00a0I'd go back a thousand times again!!",

    "text": "We had booked the special Sunday dinner offer of \u00a330 for 3 courses. \u00a0At the time of booking, the ground floor was booked up so we were offered a table in the upstairs room which overlooks Wandsworth common. When we arrived, only 2 of the 7 tables were taken but as other tables started to arrive, particularly the 2 group tables of 3 and 4, it got to be a bit too noisy. Do not book into upstairs if it is just two of you!We ordered the sliced rare beef with leeks and hake confit for starters, Aylesbury duck with roast foie gras and sea bream was for mains, and the hot chocolate pudding and pistachio cake for dessert. All were excellent and definitely good value for money that we paid. \u00a0We will definitely come back another time.",

    "text": "My boyfriend said that his lamb was the best lamb he's ever had, and my fish was delicious.This is an odd aside, but the lighting in just gorgeous - soft and warm, but not too dark to eat in. \u00a0Everyone looks peachy-skinned and attractive in that kind of light...There are only two things that aren't perfect about this restaurant. Firstly the tables are far too close together... literally elbow to elbow with the next door table in some of the tighter spots. \u00a0I knew this ahead of time, so asked for a table in a quiet corner; and they were happy to oblige luckily (definitely do the same). \u00a0Secondly, there is only a set menu so you have to have 3 courses. \u00a0It's definitely not a place for a 'lighter meal' and as a woman, the volume of creamy food is difficult to get through - though I gave it a good go because I'm a trooper.",

    "text": "Parfait!We have been wanting to go here for a long time ever since we heard it was London's favourite restaurant and Michelin starred. \u00a0Now I see why. \u00a0Six of us ate here and I heard more than one, \"This is the best restaurant I've eaten at in years.\" \u00a0Having just moved from the French-Swiss border region, I thought nothing could beat the refinement of some of the food we had there, but this restaurant did. \u00a0I could go on and on about the food but the best I can say is that everyone's was absolute perfection and the staff will help you find exactly what is perfect for you.It's not just about the food, but the service. \u00a0With a friendly, professional staff and very unpretentious environment, we got expert advice on the food and wines that would suit us well and tasted some of the finest and complex wines I've ever had. \u00a0One thing that some people might not like about the restaurant is that the timing of the service is more like what you would expect in France. \u00a0I wouldn't say 'slow' but...'gradual.' \u00a0This wasn't an issue for us because we enjoyed the conversation and it gave time for the food to digest.",

    "text": "I've been a couple more times since my original review and just want to add a note about lunch - do it. We went for lunch at the weekend and it's just a lovely lovely experience. It feels special, but laid back, and you can walk it all off on the common afterwards. I've also since had the cheese board and can recommend it. I would've liked to have been told a bit more about the cheese I chose (rather haphazardly) - the head waiter was obviously quite busy. Also, he looked really taken aback when I asked him which cheese he'd prefer of two - surely he should know what tastes nice? Anyway, maybe that's just some random restaurant faux-pas I didn't know about, don't ask waiters what cheese they like to eat. One of the cheeses tasted like photocopier toner, which was nice in a weird way, and you can't buy that in Waitrose my friends. Still worth the money, and a great place to take friends for a treat, as we did.",
