The fish was fantastic, great texture, good crispy coating, and flakey fish inside. The small size along with fries was enough to satisfy, though I wanted more. The fries were quite forgettable. I only chose to eat them with a good serving of ketchup. The ice cream was very small and nothing special as well. Overall, the fish was great and the other items were just okay. I would come back and recommend this place for its superb fish.",

I really enjoyed both. Make sure to order the small size plates (unless you have been starved for days or you are a multi food eating contest champion)! Because the portions here are HUGE! I could barely finish the small plate! Also, get the Tartare sauce, you won't regret it! Overall, very cool atmosphere and friendly staff, they've even got a retro jukebox that plays some awesome music.",

Easily the best 'traditional' fish n chips place around Soho, The batter is perfect, the chips are finely balanced between crispy and mushy, the peas and tartare sauce are made fresh onsite and the beer, is, well, beer (if you're having trouble with that last part give me a shout; I'll gladly show you the ropes). Even better, the name isn't some kind of fish pun.Most of the fish dishes here are good. They offer all the usual trappings along with some specials depending on the season. The highlight for me is the haddock, but the rock salmon is also quite tasty. Don't like fish? What's wrong with you!? That's OK though; they also make pies which are again homemade rather than that not-particularly-pukka stuff which are, again, decent.The surroundings are actually quite nice if you don't mind tiles everywhere, and the staff are friendly.Honestly you can't go wrong if you're in the area and fancy fish and chips.

We both had the haddock and chips (doused in salt and vinegar, of course), along with homemade tartar sauce... delish. And in such a convenient area too!

If you're in the Covent Garden area, I would suggest sticking around Endell St for Rock and Sole Plaice, as I really wouldn't come here all the way from CG if you're already there. Vice versa of course. The fish here is very very smooth. Have had both the cod and haddock and equally brilliant. The flesh flakes off even without the help of a fish knife, and the batter remains crispy despite my heavy handed vinegar habits. Didn't get to try the tartare sauce, since \u00a32 does make it a bit pricey for sauce. Anyway, the chips were great, the fish was great, the ambience is great. Service was pretty dang good, and most certainly cheaper than R&SP (as Michael's already reviewed)... I'd definitely come back for sure.",

Location: Golden Union has a very convenient location, just on an alley off Oxford Street. we arrived around 2pm on a Saturday, and luckily there were no line up and we were seated immediately.Food: We ordered the Cod & chips and homemade pie & chips with gravy. The fish were excellent as it was golden crispy outside, while the inside was soft. Chips were good too, made with good quality British potato. The pie was not as amazing, and we found it on the salty side.Price: the Cod & chips was 12.50 for small, and the homemade pie & chips with gravy was 9.95. This is typical price in London, but considering that it is close to Oxford Street and has higher quality fish and chips than other touristy restaurants, Golden Union has good value.Recommendation: We give it 4 stars, and would definitely recommend to anyone seeking good fish and chips in the heart of London!",

The tartar sauce is amazing but they only give you a little bit with your fish and chips. If you order extra sauce, it's almost 2 pounds for it but the container of sauce is bigger. The haddock is thick and flaky, excellent flavor, excellent batter. Thick steak-cut french fries also great. There is a selection of beer/cider/wine.",

    "text": "My first time in the U.K. (~5ish years ago), I was mostly unimpressed by the fish & chips served at an unknown pub and left thinking fish & chips pretty much tasted the same, anywhere. During this trip (Nov. 2016), I made slightly more effort to find better fish & chips and ended up here: it was worth it.The fish-fry here is much lighter and crispier than I've had elsewhere, due to a thinner, tempura-like crust. I liked this a lot because you could actually enjoy the taste of the fish instead of being literally weighed down by unnecessarily thick batter. The chips took a back-seat here: they are like \"steak fries\" in the U.S., except somehow less satisfying. (sorry U.K., but we Americans are awfully good at frying fries) Still, the chips make up half the dish of \"fish & chips\" so you'll end up eating them anyway. Stick to the fried fish here and you will be rewarded.On our way out, I was taking one last glance at the menu on the wall when the cook (and possibly owner) asked if everything was okay. (Yes. It was.) He then proceeded to tell me with pride that the difference between Golden Union's fish & chips and everywhere else in the city is that the fish is frozen elsewhere while Golden Union uses fish that arrives the same morning, often with the blood still dripping off it. I left thinking that I was impressed by how much he cares about his fried fish, which he fried perfectly every time. Finally, I leave my heart to the homemade tartar sauce, a sauce that I often hate but not here.",

    "text": "SERVICE:Service here is good. The waitress was friendly and tentative (granted I was the first and only person in the restaurant at 11:30 sharp). FOOD:I ordered the fish and chips. You can either chose Cod or Haddock, but I chose Cod since I had the Haddock before elsewhere. Cod is chunkier and has a less fishy taste to it, and to be honest it's a bit bland for my pallet, but some people prefer it over Haddock. The crispiness of the deep fried batter was great but the chips/fries were a bit less crispy and more on the mushy side. It does not come with tartar sauce and I believe it costs extra, though you do have vinegar and ketchup for free. It wasn't the best I had but still good. COST:If you plan on taking out, the price is dramatically cheaper. If my memory serves me correctly, a small portion of fish and chips would cost about 6 GBP if you chose take out, but then almost double to about 12 GBP if you chose to dine in. I chose to dine in which amounted my bill to 13.14 GBP after the service charge. No drink was ordered.If I ever come back, I think I will try the Haddock fish and chips next time with tartar sauce. I wouldn't mind giving this place a second go!",

    "text": "First time in London, gotta have fish 'n chips. My friend found this place and said that it's a local favorite, so we came here. It was quite a walk from Buckingham Palace, where we were dropped off, but we enjoyed the stroll.We both ordered the cod and chips (or was it haddock and chips, either way, it was 11.95 pounds for the small). There was a LOT of fish and even more fries. You have to order the tartar sauce separately. It would've been wiser if we ordered one large tartar sauce to share instead of two individuals, but I must've gotten confused when the waitress asked me the question. I also ordered a bottle of Lipton's lemon iced tea, which was delicious. Service was good, although we had to ask for our check. Environment was great. We got seated immediately. The restroom is in the back corner of the room, not really separate from the room, so try not to sit anywhere near the restroom. Also, the restroom is only one room, not a restroom with multiple stalls, so there might be a wait. You can't really tell if the restroom is being occupied because there's no vacant/occupied sign depending on if the door is locked or not, so it might get awkward. Double check that you've locked the door if you're paranoid like me.The only reason I give four stars is because I felt like my health went down as and after I ate the fish 'n chips here. I wish there was something like spinach. I had to get a Green Goodness from Pret A Manger afterwards to cleanse.",

The fish is well cooked in clean cooking oils, in a way that is not \"heavy\" at all - having a really easy irritated stomach :) in oily food, this shop has the easiest to digest fish and chips. It is absolutely delicious; either you order the classic dish or just fish bites. You can take away or just sit in the small cosy area at the end.",

Four years ago my Airbnb host recommended this place and I had the best Fish and Chips of that trip. This trip, \u00a0I just couldn't remember the name of this place. So, I googled \"best fish & chips\" and settled on a place between Piccadilly Circus and the British Museum. \u00a0It was my luck that I picked the same place I visited so long ago.The haddock was nice and flaky and the cod was good too. My daughter said she didn't like the batter on her prawn and chips. The service was friendly. I appreciated that they give you tap water when you ask for water. I was so tired of paying for bottled water all over Europe. The take away price is much cheaper than dining in. We dined in. If I hadn't been on the verge of hanger, I would have done take away. Since we have had Fish & Chips in lots of places, we recommend that you avoid the Fish & Chips served at Tower of London (unless you are absolutely starving), you can find better options outside the tower walls.",

So we randomly chose a little side street to try and look for something in the good old way - and there it was. It looked so simple from the outside but when we went in it felt like entering a whole new world containing fish, chips and delicious dip. We came right before the lunch rush so we got the last table before the line suddenly was all around the corner! The manager seated us, handed us the menus and we got our food very fast. Both of us had the cod and God all mighty was that GOOD! The batter was fried perfectly crispy and the fish inside was so soft - not an ounce of chewiness - and together with the lovely chips it was one of our best meals this far in England. A must to visit for the real deal! I really recommend this place for both tourists and English people (there seemed to be a LOT of locals there as well).",

For example, the oil that is used to fry the fish is important because it transfers that certain aftertaste on it. One can choose between a whole fired fish and smaller chunks of delicious heaven, wrapped in deliciousness. As you can imagine, I prefer my chips to be accompanied by pieces of fish, deeply fried and served hot. So the plan should be like this - go to Golden Union, order any fish with chips, garnish with the homemade mushy peas and just go to heaven. It's as simple as that.",

Unfortunately was very disappointed in the quality of the food and service.Ordered the large cod and chips plus scampi and chips. The batter on the cod was soaked through and thus disintegrated in my hand. The scampi was similarly wet inside and made for an unpleasant eating experience. The fish itself was very high quality but a shame that it didn't come through in the preparation. The chips were fine but have had better at the local pub.To top it off, had to wait a full 10 minutes before the bill came. I would not recommend coming here and will not be coming back again.",

    "text": "Before coming to London, my boyfriend and I knew that we had to try fish and chips somewhere in the city. We researched several options before deciding on Golden Union Fish Bar for a late dinner (9 PM)! It was the only place that wasn't about to close for the day and we were sold by the food pictures on Yelp. It most certainly did not disappoint and I would recommend it to friends looking for a delicious and reasonably priced meal in a hip setting. We ordered: large cod fish and chipsFood: We were both super hungry, so we each ordered a large cod and chips. Note: the large is a LARGE! The cod is gigantic and I'd say that it's good enough for two semi hungry people (or one starving person like myself at the time :P) The fish was flaky, soft, and had a melt-in-your-mouth sort of texture. Freshly fried, light and crispy, with the perfect golden battered crust. The balance between the fish meat and the crust was perfect, and their homemade tartare sauce really sealed the meal, adding a fresh, creamy splash to the mix.Unfortunately, I was too full to enjoy much of the chips, but they looked tasty as well!Ambience: Clean, modern decor with awesome graphics. I love the typography used in their logo as well as the neon signs in the restaurant. Another +1: no fried or fishy odors in the restaurant! We came after the usual dinner hours, so we didn't have to wait for a table. We barely had to wait for the food too, service was quick and the two waiters who served us were friendly and helpful. Another +1: I LOVED the ketchup condiment bottle! It's shaped like a tomato and made my meal a lot more fun :P",

I felt a bit sorry for the overwhelmed couple next to us who ordered 2 separate 12 oz dishes. The cod was excellent--light and crunchy crust, fresh melt-in-your-mouth fish, and dense tartar sauce mix on the side. The dash of lemon made it even better. The fries, which looked appetizing and thick, were a bit on the dry and bland side, perhaps overcooked but not crispy at all. But hey, maybe it's an American preference to like your fries greasy, salty, and crispy on the outside/soft on the inside. That's my kind of steak fries. Had the fries not been so bland, I would have given this 5 stars because of atmosphere, value, and great fish. Tip: get the Vedett Extra Blond Lager with your F&C, as recommended by the waiter. Great pairing.",

    "text": "Amazing fish and chips - I had the cod. Amazing deep fried prawns. Light, shatteringly crunchy batter, perfectly cooked so that the fish was pillowy and flaky and juicy and tender. Tartar sauce is house made, I believe, and studded thickly with bits of pickle.The regular order of fish is 6-8 ounces, for \u00a312.95, while the large is \u00a314.50 for a 10-12 ounceportion. In my piggery and hunger, I opted for the large. I am here to tell you that piece of cod was almost as big as my head!Cute decor, with FISH spelled out in subway tiles on the wall. Free jukebox. Everything is SUPER fresh - there's not even a hint of a whiff of fish or grease in the air, and yet they are frying fish and chips and other things in hot fat all day long. Steps from the Oxford Circus tube stop, steps from Liberty London and Carnaby Street.LOVE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

I did what I always do - trust and believe in my fellow yelpers - and boyyyyyy y'all didn't let me down. There are multiple options (cod or haddock) and they don't serve small strips they serve the full filet. It's really special. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get their quintessential \"im in London so I want fish and chips\" experience.",

Since I was a party of 1, I got sat at the bar. I ordered the small haddock and chips at the recommendation of my server. She suggested it because it had more flavor than the cod. Even though I was hungry, the small size was more than enough food. 1 large piece of haddock fried to perfection and a big pile of chips. I really enjoyed the tartar sauce that it was served with. The chips weren't as spectacular as I thought they would be considering the amount of people raving about them on Yelp. To me, they were good, but not great. I prefer chips that are closer to the McDonald's style. These were more wedge-like.The food came quickly and the service was good. For the price, the portions were generous. I would recommend this place to anybody who wants a good fish and chips experience while in London.",

I got here a little later during the night, so there was no line. This restaurant offers free juke box, which seemed to be pretty classic to me! We ordered fish and chips, and shrimp and chips! Fish and chips: the size of the fish was bigger than the plate, and there was a lots of chips! This also comes with tar tar sauce. The fish was not properly seasoned, and it seemed to be tasteless, but the tar tar sauce saved the dish! I overused the tar tar sauce a bit because of the above reason.Shrimp and chips: they gave us 4 shrimps as well as lots of chips that we could not finish. This dish serves with sweet and spicy sauce, and the shrimps went very well with this sauce! Love this place even thought the seasonings were too light. Will come back for sure!",

The outside was super crispy but still very light. They pride theirselves in using high quality oil and changing it regularly and you can really taste it.I would definitely go for the small fish and chips if you're just one person or share the large between 2 people, I couldn't finish the large on my own. The mushy peas were so flavorful and really great with a splash of vinegar. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in London!",

We came here at around 6pm on a Friday, and we had to queue for around 15 mins. I don't think they allow reservations. There isn't too much seating and there's an area at the front of the restaurant for people to buy take out. Since we weren't really hungry, the two of us shared a large fish (cod) and chips, baked beans, and a milkshake. The fish was very smooth and the batter wasn't too thick! The chips (or fries) weren't our favourite though. Just not quite used to this texture in fries. The milkshake was very yummy though!I'd recommend this place.",

There isn't too much seating available and the table are quite close together. Regardless, none of this bothered us as we were eager to eat! Got the large cod fish and chips with a side of mushy peas. Personally, I like peas a lot, and these were pretty great peas. The fish was not overly fried and fish quality was great. I did not feel like I was drowning in an oil vat after eating. The chips were... ok. Thicker cut and soft. I wish the chips were crispier on the outside. My favorite part of the whole meal was their tartar sauce. So delicious - it added so much to the dish. Seemed to be a popular spot for tourists. By the time we left around, there was a line out (and blocking) the door. Worth trying for reasonably priced, quality fish!",

And light and crunchy and really EVERYTHING you could ever want in a fish and a chip! The flavor was immaculate. Also GET THE HADDOCK. It's far and away the best. If you don't get the tarter sauce to go with it you're a DANG FOOL! Sometimes the staff clues you in on this but a lot of people aren't shown \"the way\" and if you don't do this thing right, it could be the difference between a Home run and a grand slam! Get the tarter sauce and make it a grand slam!!! Also the large and the small size fish aren't much different in size but they're definitely different in price so if you think you can eat a lot get the small, if you think you can eat as much an elephant on steroids with a thyroid condition get the large.",

They don't overspice the fish, so you'll have to add salt/pepper/vinegar yourself and season to your own liking.While the food itself is great, the service leaves much to be desired. I ordered a drink and the waitress did not bring it to my table until 15 minutes later. \u00a0When I proceeded to ask for water, she nodded at me and I never saw her again for the duration of my meal, let alone that glass of H2O.I saw 4 other tables trying to flag this same waitress down for their bill, but she ignored them \u00a0and pretended to not see anyone.Definitely Annoying! So I proceeded to the front counter and paid for my meal since I didn't want to waste any more time trying to get her attention.",

Food came rather quick, they cook per order so we were prepared to wait. The cod was amazingly crispy, flaky, and fresh. The large was huge and small was perfect for me. The strawberry smoothie was also delicious but was a bit too small. I'd definitely come back and it is a must for fish and chips!!!!",

But then I went to GOLDEN UNION FISH BAR and all my previous thoughts about fish and chips were erased. For 3 girls, we got 2 \"Large\" sized Fish & Chips and we didn't even finish it all. The fish pieces are really big and there are a lot of chips. The best part about the dish is the deep fried fish, Its not a heavy batter at all and the fish is so soft! The tartar sauce goes well with the fish too! Got a light beer and my meal was perfect :)We waited about 20 minutes on a sunday after shopping on Oxford St and had really great service. Kind of pricey, but its London and in a touristy spot.I would come back and I want to tell all my friends to eat here! Craving NOW! YUMM",

    "text": "No respected foodcation to London would be complete without fish and chips.I had several shops on my radar, but decided to go with Golden Union.Large order of haddock, mushy peas, a gherkin and chips. The gherkin was much larger than I expected. About the size of a small pickling cucumber. It was juicy with a soft texture. I personally would have preferred more crunch and a more pronounced lacto-fermented flavor. The mushy peas are mushy indeed. They are about the consistency of a thick pudding and taste like fresh peas. Not a lot of complexity in and of themselves, I did not detect any spices or mint involved. A small amount of tartar sauce was provided. Nice and creamy. Has a subtle sweetness with a pickle tang. Fresh ground black peppercorn. Now the chips are thick, but have a very mild crunch. Not much flavor going on here nor anything exciting texture wise. Requires ketchup. The haddock has a fresh quality apparent in its succulent and delicately flaky meat. Beer batter crust is soft, light and sticks the fish. No batter slip here! In terms of quality and technique this is pretty, pretty good.My issue is mainly the flavor. Outside of the slight ale undertone from the batter and the mild haddock flavor, the use of condiments is necessary if one seeks nuance or complexity. Tartar sauce does quite well in this regard, but as the amount I was given is small I quickly ran out. Now, on the table, one will find salt, malt vinegar, and ketchup. I tried applying salt and vinegar. The salt and vinegar seem readily absorbed into the batter crust, but the change in flavor was barely perceptible. Perhaps I didn't add enough salt or vinegar. I ultimately found myself using ketchup as a flavor enhancer.I realize the bland nature of the dish is a bit intentional and traditional. Chips are serviceable but lack an addicting taste and texture. \u00a0The craft and quality on the haddock is truly commendable, from the meat to the batter. Thus, despite my desire for more flavor, Golden Union fries a fish fillet worth taking a detour for.",

The fish and chips here are an enormous portion. A small order of fish comes on a pretty large plate. It looked to me like a whole size of fish! The mushy peas are something to try but left little to be desired.Overall, I found the taste to just be okay. I've definitely had better in the states, and especially in Iceland. I'm a sucker for chips, so I found myself eating more chips than actual fish. All in all, I was a tad disappointed. The fish did taste better with malt vinegar! Unfortunately, after this my fiance and I got sick almost immediately. This is not ideal because public restrooms are scarce in the area! =X This only made the whole experience more unappealing.",

Although I wanted to try Fish and Chips a couple times, I ended up only trying this place, so I can only compare it to ones in the United States in places like Seattle and California.I ordered for take away, right where you walk in. The options are on the left and a la carte. The one thing that popped out to me was the need to pay for tartar sauce.So once you get a fish, chips and sauce, it was \u00a312. A little pricey compared to other ones I saw in the city.So was it worth it?It was very good...but not unbelievably amazing. I had better chips at other places during my trip. And since I did not dine in, I had wished they put more malt vinegar on it. They also did not include a lemon.I wish I could say it was better or worse than all the other shops around, but on it's own, it is satisfying.",

Both of us do not eat airplane food so by the time we arrived, we were starving!We checked into our hotel and headed straight to soho area to eat and shop (we prefer to pick light and buy clothes at the destination). Being hubby first time in London he naturally wanted to eat fish and chips. This place was closest to where we were shopping (Oxford street) that night according to yelp so we walked over here. The inside is small with a take out area in the front and seating in the back. This place was packed so we knew the food would be good. I love the retro diner decor feel We got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table since a table was just leaving as we arrived. But later that night there was a small line. Both hubby and I ordered the standard cod fish and chips with a beer. Very affordable around 13-15p depending if you get a larger size. The fish was so good! Crispy and light despite being deep fried. The warmth of the dish was perfect on the cold winter night. The hint of sweet barley taste from the crispy beer batter with the light fluffy cod texture inside was a deadly combo. The fish tasted fresh. And fries/chips? Every girl likes fries!! This is probably the best British fish and chips I have had in London. I highly recommend. It's casual dining, affordable, fast, and delicious. y",

    "text": "Came here based off the Yelp reviews and everyone telling me to try the fish and chips in London. I'm guessing it is something of a specialty out there because there were a lot of other locations we passed before selecting this place. I ordered the Haddock and chips because the server suggested it was the best tasting. It was such a large serving for a small order. (Check my picture). It's a small area but seems pretty busy. You walk in passing the kitchen and notice all the signs stating they make everything fresh to order which is nice to know. You wait about 5 minutes while your table gets prepared. Food comes out with a bit of a wait but understandable since it's super fresh. My first impression was that the batter was nice and crispy but light tasting compared to the fried items you get in the states. Chips we're also the same in my option but really good paired with ketchup. The fish was a perfect pick for me because it was nice and flaky with a tad buttery taste. It was not what I expected since everyone raved about it. The batter although good was not really flavorful. I added lemon, vinegar, and tarter sauce to amp it up a bit which was good but it still felt something was missing. Maybe on my next visit I'll just try one at the train station because they are alot cheaper and I feel like i would get the same quality. Quick tip: takeout is a bit cheaper than dining in. They print out receipts with no place to add tip so I'm guessing service charge is included in the done in charge. Also, if you pay by card they bring the credit card machines to the table and it's all done in front off you. Super easy and fast. We need that out in the states!!!!",

They used to be called Chippy's fyi.I ordered the cod/chips for take-away (its cheaper that way since they charge more if you sit in!) & it was soooo delicious! It was very crispy and downright freshhh. It's definitely better than what I've had in the states.I chatted with the girl while she fried up my baby, and she was such a sweet heart!

We were in the area though and in the mood for some fish and chips, so we checked it out.You can get take away or dine in. Prices are a little bit higher if you dine in. They had 3 or 4 different kinds of fish -- cod, haddock, coley and may some others. You can get it in small or large. Even the \"small\" is quite large, so unless you're a fatty, I'd recommend the small for most folks, especially if you're getting additional sides such as the delicious mushy peas.I tried the coley because it was the cheapest. The fish itself was okay but not as tasty as the haddock that my wife got. The batter was very good on both -- not too greasy and cooked just right. Their tartar sauce is homemade and some of the best tartar sauce I've had. They do offer beer, but only bottled beer. I believe they also offer wine.I would definitely go here again.",

I ordered the small, which was plenty for my normally huge appetite - I saw someone get the large and it looked like a massive meal.

Once walking in there is a line for take out, \u00a0the line was long and popular. But my hubby and I opted to dine in. We found out it's a lot more expensive to dine in than take out. Almost half the price! But it was worth it and service was good. We were seated by a waitress, the servers there did not seem like they were from London ( can tell by the accent) but they were so friendly and welcoming. My hubby opted for fish and chips large and myself I got the king prawns. They were delicious!!! The fries in my opinion were mediocre. The batter for the fish and the prawns were great!!! A lot of food!! Neither of us finished our fries. Large portions. I ordered a milkshake - very rich and sweet! My hubby opted for a pale ale beer. He also ordered the mash peas which were not very good and not worth the price, hardly touched that. So next time you come just stick to the fish and chips!! They are awesome !! Opt for take out if you want to save money :)",

Definitely order the haddock, homemade tartare, and mushy peas!The hubs ordered the haddock and I ordered the cod. They were both amazing, but I liked the haddock slightly more than the cod since it was fluffier. We were going to order the small size for both, but when the server told us that you get about 2 ounces more fish for only \u00a31 more, we both ordered the large size, in typical American fashion. The chips were addictive. They reminded me of In-N-Out fries from the US...they tasted freshly cut and were just crispy enough. All of the fish and the chips stayed crispy 'til the last bite!We also ordered the homemade tartare sauce. I would say the hubs and I dip a moderate amount of sauce and the small size was just perfect. The mushy peas were also a pleasant surprise! I normally don't like peas, but these peas were so good that they reminded me of one of my favorite Chinese desserts (mung bean soup), but in a savory form. Now off to find a good mushy pea recipe!",

I had the small Cod and Chips and was pleasantly surprised when my plate came with a GIANT, deliciously battered, light and fresh fillet. The cod was nice and meaty and the batter was so incredibly light. I couldn't believe it. We're not talking a tiny piece of fish and inch thick batter--this was all fish, baby. I loved every bite and WISHED that California had anything even remotely like this. Chips weren't that good. The fries were a bit dry and could use some salt but, luckily they have plenty to ketchup and vinegar for me to dress them with.For me, Golden Union Fish Bar has been my most memorable meal in the UK thus far.",

I asked the manager if he could watch my kids. By the time I got back which wasn't even 30minutes, they had moved my kids to the bar eating area and completely cleared our table. We stayed until closing to file a police report. While doing so my kids were helping our waiter clean up which was fine because it kept them distracted while my husband and I talked to the police. While filing our police report the manager comes over to us to tell us that he had called the owner of the restaurant to tell him what happened to us and told us the owner said he felt horrible and told him not to charge us. The manager told him that he had already charged us and then he says \"Sorry about that. What do you guys want me to do?\" What do you expect us to say? Of course we were like \"It's fine.\" However he saw first hand everything that happened to us, he saw my son crying cause he was scared we weren't going to come back for them, he had our table cleared when none of us were even done eating and he CHARGED US IN FULL. Like, is this a joke? Are you a human being? The fish was good, our waiter was great, the manager needs a heart. He even said to us \"when I spoke to the owner he said that i shouldn't have even charged you before i called him.\" Like what is the point of you telling us this?! You are worse than the people who took my bag.",

    "text": "A really great place to get well cooked fish and chips in the heart of London Town. The restaurant has a very modern, fresh, clean vibe going on, with tiled floors and walls as well as neon signs and paintings of fishing boats. They cater for both those who want to take out or if you want to eat in.We did the latter. We ordered cod, chips, saveloy and mushy peas. Everything was hot, the chips were chunky and just greasy enough whilst the fish was coated in a golden crispy batter and inside lay the mouthwatering fish. The saveloy was full of the spicy sausage flavour, though seemed a little dried out. The mushy peas hadn't made an appearance three quarters of the way into the meal, so I asked for the order to be cancelled and they did apologies. There were the standard condiments on the table, salt, vinegar and sauce. Whilst all the food was great there was some element about it that made me feel it wasn't a wholly traditional fish and chip experience. Perhaps it was the lack of wrapping paper. The bathroom was pretty standard and an average amount of clean.I will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Was in London for the first time and knew that I had to try fish and chips! I found this place listed on top fish and chips spots in London so of course I had to come and check it out. The place was very clean and super sleek and modern inside. Great service and quick food. I would recommend ordering the normal size portion of fish and chips and not large. My husband eats a lot and he was perfectly satisfied with the normal size, the large looked huge from what I saw across other customer tables. I got the fish bites, which is basically fish and chip but you get cod and haddock fish in smaller bites. I would highly recommend this, it was a few pounds cheaper and exactly the same thing that my husband got (when he paid a bit more for the fish and chips). They do have a 12.5% optional service charge added, which I thought was a strange. It makes the situation awkward because you really don't want to pay the extra pounds, but it's weird asking them to remove it. This definitely gave me a bad taste in my mouth. I'm from America so I normally tip when I go to Europe when I get good service, so I thought it strange that they would sort of force it on you. The fish and chips was also very bland. This may be because I'm used to more seasoning. The crust itself was very flaky and good. Overall food was OK, but I'm sure others would enjoy it more if they are bigger fish and chip fans.",

We had the cod, prawns, and sausage which were all really good. The portions were huge!! I dont remember what the larger fish portion is called but unless you plan to take it to go or share it, you don't need it. The prawns were huge as there was more shrimp than breading. As for the sausage I didn't even know you could fry a sausage but it was also huge. \u00a0This location is convenient as it is just off oxford street.

They several choices for the fish (Cod, Haddock,etc.), a good sign in itself. The oil must be light along with the batter so the fish really stands out.The location is tucked right off Oxford Street in the bustling area near Oxford Circus on a quieter [Poland] street.

The fish itself was fried very well and the crispy outside wrapped the juicy fish interior. The tartar sauce paired perfectly well with the fried fish.

Then I came to the UK and I've been learning that us Yanks have a lot to learn about properly frying foods! I came here during the summer while backpacking through Europe.I ordered a large haddock and chips, Guinness, and mushy peas. The fish was fried beautifully, in a way that I've never seen fish fried before. It was so light and crispy that it reminded me of phyllo pastry on the outside, and the juicy and steaming fish in the center was perfect. The chips were equally perfectly fried, and the peas were so damn tasty.Service was friendly and offered me some suggestions, and the restaurant was vibrant with a lot of customers even mid-day. It was boiling hot inside the restaurant though, which can I guess be attributed to the heat wave this summer.I know that I need to explore the chippy scene in England more when I go back, but for what I got to try in London, this was the best fish & chips I've ever had in my life.",
