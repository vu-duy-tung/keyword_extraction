    "text": "We went for the \"whole bird\" which contained 8 pieces of chicken and 4 wings. I opted for the honey and ginger glazes and I must say it worked really well with the lovely crispy skin, the chicken pieces were well seasoned and not too salty, definitely a big improvement if you compare it to KFC, but my main problem was the inconsistency of the meat, some were really tender and some were really dry so I wondered if the pieces we had weren't that fresh and got mixed up with the fresh batches. For a premium chicken joint, this really shouldn't happen. Overall a nice and trendy concept, but some room for improvement.",

    "text": "The funny thing about American-style restaurants opening in London is that they either seem to be opened by non-Americans who think they know what it should be like, or by Americans who know what it should be like (but somehow still manage to fail). I'm pretty sure Bird falls in the former category. We recently came here for Yelp Book Group. While we were waiting for everyone to arrive, my partner and I sampled a few of the cocktails and came to the conclusion that they are pretty terrible, weak and quite small. That was an unfortunate start to the meal, but he did find a decent white wine on the wine list that we ordered and enjoyed.Some of the food was amazing, and some of it left things a bit lacking. My partner and I split the chicken and waffle burger and some wings. The entire table shared a few sides: Fries, the house slaw, the Korean cucumber salad and the corn pudding. The burger was tasty with nicely fried chicken, but the waffle left me a bit wanting. The \"hot sauce\" on the burger was really bland to be honest. Apparently Frank's Hot Sauce was the original used in buffalo wings, but I don't get why people like it because to me it's just a bit watery and boring. Speaking of buffalo wings, just don't. They are really quite mild and the blue cheese dip is really kind of runny and insipid. Buffalo wings deserve better. They deserve a powerful sauce with a nice thick blue cheese with chunks of blue cheese running through it. The Asian hot and sweet wings were definitely better and probably the way to go next time. Oh and avoid the ranch sauce. It's basically just buttermilk with hardly any seasoning in it. Really? Of the sides, the best was the corn pudding. The slaw was a nice Asian-style slaw so really light and tasty. The cucumber salad was nice, but basically just like a handful of marinated cucumber slices. The fries were pretty poor. And did I tell you sides are \u00a33.5 each? So they're quite expensive for what you get.We all decided to split the ice cream sandwich for dessert. It's basically a doughnut with a scoop of ice cream in the middle. We went for rum raisin. The ice cream was great, but the doughnut was kind of average. And the sandwich is a giant doughnut with ONE scoop of ice cream. The ice cream to doughnut ratio was really bad. If you get it, I recommend getting some extra ice cream on the side because you'll need it.The service is a bit iffy too. I felt like we were kind of just left there for most of it except when they brought us our food. It took us ages to flag down anyone to get our bill after we ate. So basically the chicken is good. Order it with a lot of corn pudding on the side. Either go for the fried chicken or the wings and unless you like really sweet sauces, go for the Asian sweet and hot sauce. Or maybe just plain. But in all honesty, unless I'm with a group of people who really want to go here, I don't imagine I'll be back. There wasn't enough good stuff on the quite limited menu to give me incentive to return with other places nearby do a much better job on their food.",

The batter was very crispy and surprisingly greaseless but the color was an unappetizing dull grayish yellow. More importantly it was under seasoned. They offer a lot of different sauces and glazes but it seemed like they tried so hard to create a crispy fried chicken they forgot about flavor. The sauces were fine but not memorable. \u00a0I'm sad to say I prefer some of the local chicken shops to this one in terms of flavor. That said I applaud the effort to bring a better fried chicken to London. I think they should spend more time trying some American southern fried chicken or from the street vendors in Bangkok to see what they're missing. Atmosphere is like a casual upscale diner.",

I agree with other reviewers about the side orders being a bit meh, other than the corn pudding which was really good. But the chicken is sooooo tasty, the music was great and the fact is that I have already sent a number of people there, some just because they saw the photo of the chicken and waffle burger says a lot. The menu is quite limited but I reckon that there are still enough things on there left for me to try that it merits return journeys, or I could go for the burger again - did I mention that I liked it??",

    "text": "One of the food combinations of the moment appears to be fried chicken and waffles. Perhaps this has been influenced by the success of the 'Duck and Waffle' restaurant in the city. I noticed the trend when surfing twitter feeds and reading the newsletters from restaurant reviewers. Let's be clear on where I stand: it's a great combination of two of the best comfort foods!I was expecting such a restaurant to be in the Shoreditch/Hoxton area. I made a search using the reliable Yelp app and I was suggested this restaurant. It is roughly in between the Shoreditch and Hoxton overground stations.I went there for a late lunch. Because of the time of day, there was a lot of space and I sat next to a window to watch the people passing outside. I ordered the fried chicken and waffle (of course) and a Hackney pale ale. There are plenty of other nice meals on the menu and I also spotted a specials board.There are two nicely fried pieces of chicken and a savoury waffle, but it comes with a cup of sweet syrup. (I think it was maple.) My preconception was confirmed: it was a delicious meal.If I am vaguely in the area, then I will head back there again. It looks like a great place to go with a group of friends to have tasty chicken and drinks.",

    "text": "Bird might just be the word you're looking for if you're looking for fried chicken in Shoreditch. Chicken and waffle isn't that much of a thing yet, but if you've TRIED it, then you know it should be.BIRD does good, but not GREAT fried chicken. It's a little on the oily side, without the satisfying payoff of that moment where you're like \"damn, that was the best fried chicken I've ever had\". What elevates the meal is surprisingly the waffle. A lovely giant cheese and onion waffle. With LOTS of cheese. Cheese in the waffle, cheese between the chicken. So much cheese. So heavy. And Bacon. Hello!The chicken waffle burger is a beast and one you'll need a good appetite to tackle. The southern fried wings were again oily but the glaze was pretty good.The service was pretty lacklustre to be honest. Doors were left open whilst staff chatted to persons outside. Requests for water had to be repeated. The place was cold. A little fuss was made over the table booking despite the restaurant being half empty.These things aside however, it's a rarity to get chicken and waffle together and it's the combination of the core ingredients that make this place good. If you can forgive whatever is going on around you, then when that chicken waffle burger arrives, you'll forget whatever annoyances were occurring and work on defeating this beast of a burger.PS. Do not try to eat with hands. That's just asking for a mess!",

As the restaurant was quiet, we were served quickly and our food was with us around 15mins after ordering - the only fault I'd mention for service was actually that three seperate staff members asked us if our food was okay - unnecessary, but hardly hugely problematic!Rather than the below-pictured Original Waffle Burger, I had the signature Fried Chicken, Waffles and Syrup. I really didn't think it would work but it SO TOTALLY DID. Seriously, wow. The chicken itself was fried to perfection - a crispy exterior encasing soft, falling-off-the-bone meat, complemented perfectly by the sweetness of the runny maple syrup. I also picked up some fries with my dish - definitely a solid choice, well-cooked and delicious - but still paling into comparison to the wonder that was my main dish. Quite honestly - you probably don't need sides doing this but the variety of glazes for the chicken wings is impressive, with something for all tastes. There's a slight focus on Asian flavours for a lot of the glazes too.I've already actually made plans to make a return visit - and for someone who tends to try loads of restaurants rather than go back to regulars, that's a big seal of approval.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch today as part of their half-off promo for the new lunch menu. About half the tables were occupied but the manager (who had an IDGAF expression on his face for our entire visit) said it would be five to ten minutes. We sat at the bar until the barman took pity on us and left the bar to speak to the manager, and then we were seated. Service was slow, but that's because they had only two people on the floor plus the manager for the first half of our visit. Two more staffers came later to deal with the stressful dining room. There was a bottleneck situation near the front due to the manager's weird seating policy - lots of empty tables and at one point four different parties waiting to be seated. We saw one girl get seated, sit without service for about ten minutes and then walk out. The table next to us got their food after us and two other tables, even though they were there first. Anyway that's all I have to say about the service and poor management, with no apologies or explanations for long waits. Our bill had an error on it, which was quickly rectified when we pointed it out, and when we asked if we could leave extra tip on the card (felt super bad for the stressed out servers), she said she didn't know how and it would be easier to leave cash.But the food was pretty good - nice dark meat cuts of fried chicken, delicious tangy dressing on the Caesar salad and fresh doughnuts. Love the hand wipes on the table and the fun music. Was really worth it for the promo price but wouldn't return for the regular lunch price unless they sort out the service aspect and the manager's strange too-cool attitude.",

    "text": "Bird is one of the latest entrants capitalizing on the fried chicken craze that's building up in the capital. Sure, we've had some pretty decent chicken spots holding down the fort, but it's only the last 6 months or so that the tempo of new openings has really built up. Taking over the space on Kingsland road from a couple of largely defunct bars, Bird has a modern theme with exposed brick and shiny metal chairs that are far more comfortable than you'd expect. The wings are cooked well with very crispy skin and juicy meat and the honey-ginger glaze was absolutely delicious being both sweet and spicy in just the right balance. The buffalo sauce was adequate but lacked both the heat and tangy bite I'd associate with a true buffalo hot wing - this was rather mild although kudos to Bird for sourcing some proper blue cheese dip.We moved onto the full bird (we got it mixed but you can opt for white or dark meat) which is a pretty hefty amount of chicken for \u00a324. It's enough to feed 4 people - even with our bottomless pit of a friend - and you can mix the glazes if you wish. We went with the gochujang sauce which was bold, spicy, and rich - and excellent option for fried chicken. As with the wings, the execution was flawless with ridiculously crispy skin and succulent flesh. It's a tough call, but I think the chicken edged out Clutch to be my favorite fried chicken in the city.And if the chicken alone wasn't enough, Bird won me over with the chicken and waffle burger. It's pretty much exactly how it sounds with a massive fried chicken breast being sandwiched between two halves of a cheddar and onion waffle. Plus they add bacon and maple syrup to really ensure you get a full taste of all that is good in the world. Sure, it's not perfect and I'd have preferred the waffle to have a bit of crunch, but damn that thing is good. It's incredibly filling and I doubt I'd want to have more than half of it in one go, but for \u00a313 it's an excellent value proposition.Sides were hit and miss with the Korean cucumber salad being nicely pickled white the bowl of fries were thin, stringy, and largely disappointing. I'd love to see some mash and gravy on there as well and maybe some kimchi, Bird, if you're going to stick with the Southern US/Korean hybrid approach.Desserts were meh with the doughnuts being dry and stale despite claims they were freshly fried and the ice cream sundae collapsing on itself. I'd happily come back for another fried chicken feast and you could feed four people for around \u00a310-15pp quite easily. I'd pass on the desserts which seem overpriced and probably the fries as well. But you're not coming to Bird for quality fries, you're coming for a bird that's fried to perfection and enhanced with some flavorful sauces. And that my friends, is what Bird is all about.",

The only animal I want to see armoured is a talking polar bear ... Quality of meat wasn't bad but not great.Waffle with cheese and spring onion was unexpected in both taste and texture felt a lot more like Yorkshire pudding than it did waffle ... Am sort of assuming no baking powder used in the batter.The enormous pot of maple syrup was generous but what was I supposed to cover with so much sugar?The harshest criticism of the food was actually \u00a0made by the waiting staff, he deliver the food and pointed at the hot sauce and said \"that will make it all taste better\".",

    "text": "I came here last night with my family to meet a few friends for social. Let me say this straight off, it's a great place for groups to chill and chat as that is exactly what we did. The best thing about bird is of course the fried chicken bird, highly crispy on the out side and really succulent and juicy on the inside. The second good thing about this place is the waffles as it a yellow golden texture that is golden yellow with a slight crunch on the out side but definitely soft and deliciously fluffy on the inside. To be slot more critical, as much as I like this place I couldn't help but notice how the crispy fried butter milk chicken was bland. Yes bland! Just bite it without any dipping sauce or the cover of bacon and cheese as you eat the waffle sandwich and you will definitely notice you are eating textures. This for me was disappointing especially when this place is all about the bird. To be frank, I'm surprised no one else picked up on this?On the other hand I did really like the buffalo wings which by this stage was to be expected, golden crispiness smothered with the tangy buffalo sauce (I do believe if the wings were not covered with sauce then it would have tasted as bland as the chicken pieces). The chicken here needs to be able to stand up by its self on its own merits and I don't believe it does that. This could easily be resolved with seasoning of salt on the bird before coating in the batter to be fried or simply marinating it in some select herbs and spices and then we're talking. The fries in the other hand were not as bad as other reviews made out but yes they were disappointing as ours were crispy but over done as their was no identifiable potatoes inside to be eaten so the fries could be a miss in fact most if not all the sides can go a miss as well as the dessert for that matter as the doughnuts and ice cream was nothing to sing and dance about. So would I go back, yes! But only for a waffle and chicken sandwich that has flavour from the bacon, sauce and cheese as well as ordering the wings with a glaze is also a thumbs up from me.",

    "text": "I came here with friends in Summer 2014 a couple months after opening. As a fan of fried chicken, I don't eat it often because of them there health related reasons, but when I do have it I want it to be an amazing experience. Having said that, there aren't too many opportunities for great fried chicken in London though the last 2 years have seen the rise of more gourmet chicken shops amongst the background of the greasy ones we love to hate.My experience at Bird was nice following a gym session with said friends so we all deserved it. I ordered the chicken and waffle burger as I'm heavily influenced by American's and Snoop Dogg loves this, therefore I had to try it if only once! The chicken itself was good, but not great: the batter was good but not crispy and light \u00a0as I've experienced when in NYC. If I could I'd give the chicken 3.5/5. The waffles were a pleasant surprise as I was expecting plain potato waffles but these were wheat I think but had ham and (possibly) spring onions inside - nice (though a little dry) therefore 4/5. The meal was served with maple syrup as a condiment, this gave a nice sweet undertone to the dish but there was so little of it, I didn't just want more I NEEDED more! You got literally 3 teaspoons of it. I guess they still had kinks to work out at this point so I made the suggestion to the waitress for their next board meeting. Points had to be deducted for this transgression so I had to award a 2.5/5. The service was nice enough but I can't award a final score of 3.5/5 so it's sticking at 3 stars.I'll be going back to Bird this Summer 2015 for a follow up and hopefully a 4.5/5 experience.",

Not much passion or energy.But the chicken wasn't bad. A good sticky crispy shell covering tender enough juicy chicken inside.The sauce I had was an interesting Japanese one and the flavours were zingy.And the chips were really very good. Crisp and firm, well seasoned. I ordered some pickles in vinegar and sesame seed which also complemented the meal well and cut through nicely.So the food was not bad at all but the service and place was a little lacking. It struck me that a place championing the chicken should maybe have a bit more about where their chicken comes from and why it's so good. A bit of a provenance story wouldn't have gone amiss. But there wasn't anything like that there and it led me to suspect that this brand doesn't really care about that.From my visit I didn't get an inkling of what it IS passionate about. And for me, with so many other brilliant places to eat in the close vicinity, this lets it down.",

    "text": "Four stars for great American classics surrounded by the London vibe. The city bustles about outside, but through these doors, it's time to chill and gorge on unhealthy, yet delicious deep-fried goodness.If you're not too familiar with Southern American cuisine, fried chicken & waffles has been all the rage since, like, forever. It's been making a big comeback in LA recently, however, and we have one called 'Birdies' wit ha similar fried chicken & doughnut concept. Sadly, though, the taste of the chicken itself isn't really any better than you would find at any of the local fried chicken chain restaurants you'll find scattered throughout London.The thing to get your first time here are either the wings for starters and at least one fried chicken & waffle dish. My suggestion: Go with The Original Waffle Burger- A hefty portion of 2 100% free range chicken thighs, bacon, American cheese, house BBQ, mayo, hot sauce, & Canadian maple syrup, miraculously wedged between 2 freshly griddled waffles. At \u00a314, it is a bit of a splurge, but believe me, if you like to eat, this is well worth it.They have plenty of other, less gut-bursting options like fried chicken skillets, smaller burgers- including a veggie beet burger- wings, sides like deep-fried pickles, cheesy Korean fries, & jalape\u00f1o corn pudding, and of course, decadent desserts like the Ice Cream Doughnut Sandwich & Deep-Fried Waffle with Ice Cream, Cinnamon Sugar, Chocolate & Caramel Sauce, & Whipped Cream.Oh, and don't forget, such an unhealthy meal just wouldn't be complete without plenty of booze to go around, from cocktails, ales, beers, & ciders.Yes, it is ridiculous. I hope you have friends to share with. It might help it to go down easier.",

    "text": "I WHOLE HEART LOVE fried chicken, so I'm going to be thorough with this.The birdbirdbird, the (3 star) word on the Bird is:The theme is American diner (think: bright orange decor! Booths!) with a decidedly Southern American skew to the menu (think: fried pickles! Jalape\u00f1o corn pudding!). In theory, I am strongly in favour of both of these directions.In practice, though? Meh. Ben W. mentioned that the staff seem to be off their game, and we experienced the same. Maybe it was the time of day (off-peak), maybe it was the weather (hot as Hades), maybe maybe maybe. End result: the staff definitely did not seem keen to be there. Bummer.The menu is vast, with separate menus for drinks and yet another one for desserts. There were non-fried-chicken options (a healthy sounding multi-component salad which, if I weren't in the market for some crispy chicken, would have nudged its way much more strongly into my list of contenders), as well as options for veggies, but I wasn't at Bird for either of these. There are several options for fried chicken sandwiches, most made with thigh. GO FOR THIS, THIGH IS UNDERAPPRECIATED AND DELISH. Bird also offers various \"skillets\" of fried chicken, featuring a combo of leg, wing, and thigh. These come with some dipping sauce options, from Korean fried chicken, to Nashville hot, to Buttermilk ranch and blue cheese. The chicken itself was the best part of the meal for me: I liked the peppered batter, and it adhered nicely to the meat with a decent crunch. It was a little past golden for me, which is a personal preference (I like my fry not so dark). The blue cheese dip lacked the big chunks that I'm used to from American shops. But, fine: crispy, moist, flavourful. Points there.The sides were, in a word: weak. The fries were limp. We went for \"Korean style\" fries which claimed to have kimchi but, in truth, just had some amped up turbo-charged gochujang paste sauce instead. I didn't finish them (this is notable if you know me). The corn pudding was not how I'd imagined it from the description; the texture was off, the breadcrumbs were unnecessary, and the only saving grace was the jalape\u00f1o peppers. For dessert? A deep fried waffle with cream and icecream (yep, both) which showed up at the table...un-fried. We got that mistake fixed swiftly, and it was fine: cinnamon sugar, and cream, and carbs are tough to beat. But if you're going to be INDULGENT (caps) you want it to taste amazing. Not sure this fit the \"worthy indulgence\" algorithm.35GBP roughly, and I nabbed a snack on the way home. I don't see myself returning, as I can find better high/low fried chicken in London elsewhere (high: Chicken Shop in the Hoxton Hotel! Low: most any chicken shop!).Yelp note: Deliveroo an option, too! Fried chicken in PJs is tough to beat.",

Although it is slightly inconveniently located (for me) at the top of Kingsland Road the restaurant is definitely worth a visit. It covers 2 floors with plenty of tables so the no reservation policyshouldn't cause too much of a problem. We arrived at 6 on a Friday evening and there was plenty of space even when we left at 7.30. The chicken here is goooood. We tried the wings to start which were tender, with a well seasoned crumb but seriously messy (wet wipes are provided). You can also choose from 8 sauces of which I definitely recommend their bbq. The wings weren't as crispy as I had hoped but full of flavour. Our mains however were perfect. Fried to perfection but still very tender chicken. I went for the waffles and chicken which is served with maple syrup and a sweet butter. Seriously bad for you but honestly worth it. My bf had their spicy chicken burger which was tricky to eat because of all the glorious sauces they added. As if we needed it but we both also got dessert sharing their waffles and ice cream and their doughnut of the day ice cream sandwich. Both were seriously good. My only suggestion would be to consider how they serve the mains and dessert as the plates and bowls were a little small for the portion size making it even harder to eat. As well as delicious food they also have a great selection of cocktails and beer although we stuck with tap water which was regularly topped up by friendly waiters (along with much needed never ending supply of napkins). Overall we were both really impressed and definitely rank as one of the top fried chicken restaurants.",

For a place that was priding itself on fried chicken, I was intrigued to see what their breakfast menu had to offer.The Breakfast menu was short but sweet. They offered a good number of dishes to choose from with additional extras as optional on top of your main dish, if you were feel more peckish. Intially the 'Doughnut Buttle' jumped out to me on the menu, given my love for the sweeter things in life. Looking down the menu, my hunt for fried chicken was successful found under the 'Extras' section of the menu.The fried chicken on offer was tastey and very satisfying. For a place that also offered Gluten Free options and have all their chicken sourced from free range, I was not dissappointed with what was on offer.",

Another star was deducted for the pushy waitress trying to get us to have a doughnut as dessert (\"Only \u00a32 to take away!\"). She left me shaking my head and thinking 'Darling, we just ate waffles the size of my head - No thanks to the doughnut'. (But they did look great, I won't lie).But to finish on a positive - a good selection of local brewed craft beers, and for a warm Sunday in one of London's busiest boroughs it was nice and quiet and the service was prompt!Worth a visit for sure :)",

Went again on Saturday (why do I keep doing this to myself?!!) and once again was pleased enough with the food but the service felt like banging my head on a wall. I also had a friend with me who is gluten free/dairy free (her awesomeness makes up for her dietary shortcomings) and the waitress didn't even try to help her find something to eat. I know that's a challenge, but it's called HOSPITALITY. Helping a hungry guest is part of the game. Sigh. Delivery from now on. And they're opening up two new sites?!! I just hope their new staff are better.",

    "text": "So back in August last year, I had a go at the old Deliveroo. There isn't a lack of delivery services, but as some of the restaurants I work with had been approached to join them, I wanted to try them from a consumer point of view. All in all, it was a good and professional service. My food of choice was chicken from Bird. As you will read from my previous review, I was unfortunately not impressed. Fast forward 6 months and having been out voted for something to eat on a quiet Monday, we ended up, physically, at Bird.Although our choices were plenty and different, unfortunately it was pretty much the same result as my last experience. Two of us opted for two pieces of white chicken each, with a sauce on the side. Andee, went for 6 chicken wings. We had chips and deep fried pickles as sides. The chicken was tough, rather tasteless and even the sauces did not bring out the flavour. For what you pay, Nandos is better. Sorry. I'm not quite sure what they are getting at here. With chicken as the main option they have a combination of the normal sauces/glazes (bbq, buffalo, hot etc), but then weird Asian ones (stick soy, Korean gochujang). I am sorry, but I am not sold on this concept. If the mains were good, we could perhaps overlook the mish mash of the menu. Three disappointed girlies here.Where they are on to a winner, is with the desserts. We had the ice cream doughnut sandwich, cherry sundae and banana split. They were HUGE and really tasty. Whilst we left on a high because of the sweet sweets, there will not be a third time lucky for this spot I am afraid.The service whilst ok was intermittent. The room started off empty but gradually filled up (very child friendly), and the service was really not so warm, more like, we have to be here to get paid. I guess we felt from the interior and style of food that it should be like an American diner with that warm, over the top welcome and regular check-backs (up-sell opportunities), etc. A bit like The Diner and Red Dog Saloon nearby. But no, it was very lack lustre.",

The chicken was crispy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. I got two sauces on the side - the sweet and spicy Korean and the Nashville Hot. I would recommend getting the Korean on the side, not smothered on the chicken, as the skin won't stay crispy if you pour sauce on it. Staff were friendly and I loved the background music playingDefinitely need to make a trip back and try the chicken burger and the chicken and waffles",

The fried chicken was juicy and the breading was tasty and crisp. The fries were a bit of a let down, so I'll skip those next time. The beer was nice though, a local London microbrew.I had the Chicken and waffles and they were both fab! The waffles had cheese and spring onion inside, so they were somewhere between a sweet and a savory waffle (once I doused them in maple syrup!). Next time, I think I'm going for their chicken wings. Looking around at what other customers ordered, I think that's the way to go.They also sell donuts (which are apparently all the rage), but I'll have to taste for myself next time.",

    "text": "I wound up in Arizona last spring for work, and in the spirit of adventure ran and ate my way around Tempe. We had the good fortune to be put up in the Graduate though, so no matter how far I ran, and which neglected dishes I went for, nothing could stand up to the hotel diner's chicken n' waffles. I wasn't sure about them until I tried them, but I was an instant convert on contact.Bird's chicken n' waffles are not those chicken n' waffles. I don't think I really expected them to be, but for what comes to about twice the price, I was hoping for a slightly more convincing attempt. For starters, even taking into account US v UK portion control, there's not enough chicken OR waffles. The waffles are a bit too squishy, and the chicken is neither crisp or seasoned enough. If you've not had the real deal, I guess what I'm saying is... this is... okay? I don't think it'll make a convert of anyone. If you have, it'll kind of scratch that itch, but not to any great degree of satisfaction. I find myself oscillating between here and The Diner in Spitalfields Market, but where Bird's substance is lacking, the Diner's staff are irritatingly inattentive. Please London, don't make me go back to Tempe. I do like it, but it's an awfully long way just for decent chicken n' waffles.",

    "text": "I was really excited when Bird first opened up and had been meaning to go for a while especially as it serves gluten-free fried chicken. Now, before I go on I must confess that a few weeks before my first trip to Bird I had my first experience of fried chicken at my friend's house. She made it all from scratch and what a delicious, gluten-free feast she made. Based on that meal I had great expectations for Bird. Having got seated, I ordered my fried chicken and waited in trepidation for my second ever fried chicken meal. Yes it really was a big deal for me! Unfortunately, Bird just didn't do it for me. The chicken whilst delicious was extremely greasy and the batter was non-existent. It was a far cry from what my friend had cooked up in her kitchen and if I'm honest I was disappointed. My partner also felt that the hype around Bird wasn't justified for the food we were served.I have to say that I sincerely appreciate any restaurant that goes the extra mile when it comes to gluten-free food but with such a limited menu, I would have more from Bird. I don't know whether we went on a bad day but I'm sorry to say Bird, I'm getting that recipe from my friend and sticking with that",

I read it in an article by the Londonist, then checked when I made my reservation and when I placed my order. It's true: the chicken is GF. It's fried in rice and corn flour, instead of wheat flour. You can choose whether you want dark or light meat, or mixed. I chose mixed and got a breast and a leg. The quality was so good that I would get two dark meat pieces next time, and it isn't greasy at all. You also get to choose a glaze or dipping sauce *check for allergies* - I got honey ginger glaze and it was a-mazing. The chips are also GF but were average. Next time I would sub a few chicken wings in for the chips! They also serve chicken and waffles (which my husband said were delicious), burgers, and breakfast! Their homemade doughnuts also seemed to be extremely popular too - people came in for doughnuts rather than the chicken! This place is actually a saviour to me. I just don't know WHY they don't advertise themselves as selling GF chicken?!",
