I had their suzhi gosht, a lamb and spinach stew. The meat was surprisingly tender, breaking off and melting straight into my mouth. Their chicken and potato dish was also just as comforting to eat. I topped all these wonderful flavours off with a piece of honey drenched baklava. Just the right way to end this delicately pleasing meal.",

Its very small and doesn't even have a big sign-board.This restaurant is different in many ways than most i have seen.1. Probably one of the smallest i have been to.2. Definitely the smallest menu i have seen. Dal, 2 veg dishes, 2 lamb dishes, 1 chicken dish and 1 fish dish ... and you are done.Evidently they do little ... but what they do they do great.The dal is thick and tasty ... the lamb with potatoes is the best lamb i have eaten in london ... the rice looks and tastes great ... and the serving quantity is huge (just take a look at the bread). One rice and one dish of curry will over-stuff you. The food is very different from the Punjabi-Pakistani fare that you might be used to in Indian restaurants ... closer to East Indian food (at least in the abundance of milk/yoghurt used in cooking the curry). This is the only place in London where i can say that the food tasted \"homely\". In spite of the lack of vegetarian options, even my veggie friends loved it.I don't know any other afghan restaurant and have little clue about afghan food. I am giving them 4 stars in the hope that some day they will expand their selection a bit and i can taste more afghan dishes (that day i will gladly upgrade them to 5 stars :) )By the way ... remember to book before hand. It gets very crowded. Also its closed on sundays and mondays.",

    "text": "AFGHAN KITCHEN-although lacking in any traditional Afghan designs or motifs is a pleasent enough place to eat in at any time of the day. The Jade-Green Walls,shared Pine-tables and lots of light create an atmosphere of being honest and sincere. The menu is not very extensive -it consists of 4 meat dishes and 4 vegetarian dishes all pre-prepared and very mild tasting often featuring yoghurt as one its main ingredients. I had the Lamb with Spinach which was flavourful,succulent and very filling. The vegetarian dishes are very similar to Tapas in terms of ingredients were ample.Its a good idea to eat at the Afghan Kitchen in a large group because the establishment's style of serving dishes means that you are going to get through copius amount of Pumpkin with spiced Yoghurt-it is tasty but can get repetitive. In my opinion it is better suited as a side dish,but in Afghanistan thats how they serve it. The bowls of fluffy rice and warm fresh bread are an excellent way to mop up any of the juices that are left over on your plate.Afhan Kitchen is no place to linger because not only does it get overcrowded but the staff are hard to engage in polite conversation. I think its a good standby for a quick cheap bite - a change from the norm i.e English greasy spoon cafe food or the fish and chip shop.",

    "text": "The Afghan kitchen is true Islington gem!It is a tiny non discript little place that you can easily pass by and not notice. That is exactly what I have been doing to it for the past 3 years. Andalsa a couple of months ago discovered it. I was surprised at how sparse the decor was, it was minimalist, but \u00a0i came to the realization that it was so in the most pleasant sense and thus makes the food and the service the focus of the visit. The menu as advertised is \"traditional Afghan Home cooking\" and I can vouch for that after having lived with Afghans for 5 years. The menu consists of no starters, just main courses \u00a0which are divided into a canrnvourous section and a Vegetarian section. \u00a0All the dishes can be seen behind the Deli like counter steaming away, thus making it easy for new comers to decide. Along with the curries you will see a little assortment of bowls with homemade Afghan pickles, which are just lovely (salty and tangy) and chutney. \u00a0On my last trip I had \u00a0Lavand-e-Murgh which is a lovely boneless chicken pieces in an aromatic \u00a0yogurt gravy. I had this with an order of their rice (even that was so yummy, it could be eaten on its own). I cannot put into word how flavourful the curry was, it is typical of a an afghan dish ,which consists of aromatic herbs and very few spices. Spices are predominantly used in south and East Asia, the Afghans,use herbs and salt and can do wonders with that. If you are looking for a spicy food, forget this place and Afghan food, it is not spicy !The restaurant over all gets a thumbs up from me ! It has simple flavourful food, my only qualm would be that it is very small and thus eating in is usually something I opt out of. It is a must try if you would like to try a new cuisine!",

And The lemon and mint chicken (wish I could work out the recipe) is a must have along with the aubergine. Forget the limited menu, forget the not-so-friendly staff (they respond well if you chat them up a bit - but they are efficient). Forget being claustrophobic in the toilets. Forget having to wait and there are so few tables and uncomfortable seats. Treat it as enigma. And you also have to try their mixed pickles. Once again, how they hell do they make it? But leave out the chutney - it's green goo! LOL! Cheap and not so cheerful, but worth the occasional visit for something different. Go on a week night. And the wine is okayish. Or get takeaway.",

Right? \u00a0Who wants microwaved food? \u00a0I took it cold, and warmed it up on the hob in five minutes. C'mon.Next, the Afgan bread I've previously enjoyed has a light,waffly crisp on the outside and slightly gooey dough on the innards, perfect for scooping rice or mopping up the juices. \u00a0This bread was whole wheat, which made is dense and heavy, and it was so rubbery I had a hard time tearing it, and by the time I had, most of the sesame and poppy seeds were all over the floor.And finally, although the lamb was perfectly marinated and quite delecious, the spinach and eggplant dishes were completely saturated in oil, so much so that my skin felt like it had a sheen by the end. All this considered, it wasn't terrible. We ate it all, it did taste good, and were reasonably satisfied.. we just don't feel the need to do it again soon.also .. 3.50 for plain white rice?! \u00a0No.",

My friend who's leaving London suggested this quaint place as he had heard so much about it but never experienced it. We almost walked past the giant picture window with a clear view of the one large communal table and a smaller one on the side of the ground floor of this cozy restaurant.Bottom line: few dishes, few ingredients, but blasted with the right spices and flavour combinations. Simple. Delicious. We ordered the lamb and potatoes (heavenly), chicken in yoghurt (with just the right amount of kick) along with sides of bread and buttery rice (divine). Washed it all down with cold glasses of water (which we shared with our table neighbors across the way) and I had a lovely (yet surprisingly small) glass of fresh orange-carrot juice. As others have said, this place isn't one where you linger around after a meal, but it does take some time whilst waiting for your food, so you can have your conversation then :) And at the time we went, there was the cutest baby sharing the table and her presence, smiles, and giggles charmed everyone at the table and all the passers by. I may have to go back again to try some of the veggie dishes - aubergine and pumpkin, \u00a0yum!",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place out - I don't have a lot of experience with afghani food, but what I've had has been great. \u00a0This was was not so great. \u00a0First off, we got take away. \u00a0Maybe this was the wrong move, but living literally a block away, we figured not much could go wrong in transit. \u00a0The food came cold, with them offering to warm it up in the microwave. \u00a0Now, I'm not naive, I know restaurants do this all the time, but I don't want to know about it. \u00a0And, with the soupy, saucy food they serve, and the limited menu, I don't understand why there aren't big pots of each item simmering all day. \u00a0So we declined the zapping, and heated them on the hob at home. \u00a0Really took some of the fun out of take-out.We had an eggplant dish, which, although quite tasty, was swimming in oil. \u00a0Really too much for this little tummy. \u00a0The lamb and spinach was pleasing in a comforting sort of way, but not something I would want to eat more than a few spoonfuls of - just one of those tastes. \u00a0For me, the biggest disappointment was the bread. \u00a0I've had good afghani bread before and remember it being fluffy and tender. \u00a0This bread was wholemeal, which though healthier perhaps, really wasn't what I was looking for. \u00a0It was also incredibly tough. \u00a0After cooling down just a little, it became ridiculous to try to chew. \u00a0We ended up throwing almost all of it away. \u00a0A sad story, I know.",

We tried almost all of the dishes. I would say the standouts were the Chicken, aubergines, and pumpkin. \u00a0The lamb and spinach had a mild flavor, but I think it was a good contrast with the rest of the flavorful dishes. \u00a0 The dining space is a bit cramped, and it got very loud in there as each table was trying to talk over the next, but this may be its only flaw. \u00a0We ended up talking to the guys next to us and were commenting on each other's dishes, even sampling, which made the environment very friendly. \u00a0Not sure about their bottle policy, the wine there was also quite crap.

I need tubs of yogurt to eat it and I've only had three bites so far. There are three large pumpkin chunks in the dish. As opposed to what others have said, I didn't find it stringy at all.

This is a tiny place with little to none ambience, but the pre-cooked food (it's in a showcase so you can have a look before you order) is very tasty and not unlike Pakistani food, and yet a little different. The dishes I had weren't too spicy, so if you like it hot order the pickles on the side - they have a bit more kick! The chicken in yoghurt was very nice, and the pumpkin a must have from my perspective - they use \"spaghetti pumpkins\" (you'll see what I mean) with a pleasant sweetness and interesting texture - excellent. Unfortunately the fresh bread wasn't available, but the rice wasn't bad either. Certainly worth a visit!",

    "text": "Brilliant little gem just off Upper St in Angel! I'm continuously surprised at the quality and diversity of food options up in this yuppie haven, but very happy to be so. Afghan Kitchen, as the name suggests, provides a limited but delicious range of Afghan specialities. And I'm not kidding about the limited part - there are 4-5 starters, 4 meat mains, 4 veggies mains, and an attempt at dessert. The first thing you need to do is order the bread. This is baked fresh from the time you order and is so popular that people will wait up to 30 mins to ensure they have it with their meal. I kid you not, the couple sitting in front of us were insistent and said one of the main reasons they come to AK is for the bread alone! It's a fluffy naan like bread that comes out piping hot and covered in butter - absolutely amazing. For the mains, I'll recommend the yoghurt chicken, the fish, and the pumpkin. I should mention that all this food has been prepared that day and is in massive serving dishes in a glass case on the ground floor. They will then nuke the food you order to get it hot and ready for you. Normally, any place that nukes food would be an instant veto, but AK manages to serve up incredible flavours despite the microwaving. I can understand why they do this, it's a small location and some of these dishes require hours of cooking to get the flavours just right.Back to the food! The chicken was very tender and juicy with a spiced yoghurt sauce. With just a bit of heat, it satisfies your need for decadent creaminess without sucking up all the flavours. The fish was seared and served in a chilli gravy. It was cooked perfectly with flaky flesh and vibrant chillies coming together in each succulent bite. The pumpkin appears simple but had a kick to it. I'm not sure if they sprinkle chilli on it before roasting but the combination of sweet and spicy is truly excellent.Between two of us, we finished of about 4 mains (the 4th being a cauliflower dish) and 1.5 loaves of bread which came to around \u00a340. We were absolutely stuffed to the gills though so an all-you-can eat for \u00a320? Yep I'm in anytime!",

As the seating is a bit limited, this isn't somewhere you'd want to bring a whole load of friends (I'd prefer somewhere like Tayaab's in Whitechapel for that) - but if you're looking for a yummy, flavourful meal - to change it up for the pub filled Essex Road - this is your stop. \u00a0Especially great for vegetarian friends!Must tries: sweet pumpkin and aubergines. Yum!",

With that said, their food is so. fecking. good. it outweighs all the disadvantages - including the fact that it's a little pricey (the rice especially - holy moly).",

    "text": "We are huge fans of Afghan Kitchen. The curries are lovely and great when you want some good take out. I normally get take out since the restaurant is always packed. One negative is that if you ask for your food to be heated when getting take away, they heat it in the plastic container. If you are afraid of cancer, heat it up at home.We always order the pumpkin with yogurt and the chicken curry.I don't think the bread is worth the wait.",

The few items they do have, however, are all delicious. I liked the dal and the rice, and my favorite was the lamb and least (but still tasted pretty good) was the fish.For me the place felt home-y - the energy and the food.",

    "text": "I was recommended to this place by a friend but unfortunately, the dining experience wasn't that great... First of all, the place is tiny! Only 4 tables and we had to share with others. The place can't really be defined as a restaurant nor a cafe - it's more like a canteen. The mains are \u00a37.50 and does not come with rice and the rice are overpriced at \u00a33.50. In spite that the food do taste pretty good, the over all dining experience wasn't that great and on top of that they do charge 10% service in the bill. In conclusion, I wouldn't go there again and I won't recommend it... it's overpriced and it wasn't a comfortable dining experience. Also, CASH ONLY.",
