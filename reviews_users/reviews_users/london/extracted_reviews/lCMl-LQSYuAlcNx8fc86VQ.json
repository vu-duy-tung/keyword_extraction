I had the sushi, and it was far from amazing. It was however, fine. Average, if you will. They don't have any special rolls and they put lettuce in their prawn tempura rolls, which were not especially warm. Having had better sushi rolls anywhere else, I was not impressed. Their camembert tempura was interesting, never seen that before. But interesting concept is where the good times ended, it was just deep fried cheese. And the service, while smiley and charming when they arrived, were very hard to track down throughout the meal. At one point 4 of them were standing at the counter and we had to wave our arms to get them to come over. And what's the business with having to order \u00a320 per person? The ramen is not cheap at \u00a314 so don't make people order more.The company was great though and I had a fab time. Next ramen foodclub, I will order the ramen ;-)",

    "text": "Tonkotsu ramen!I joined the small yelp outing to Cocoro where we were all searching for ramen goodness. The ramen was great. Deep, rich savoury flavour and good noodles and toppings which others have noted came on a separate plate. I suppose it gives you the option to leave some components out if you don't like them. I just shovelled it all in.Since I developed more of an interest \u00a0with ramen, I read that tonkotsu ramen is made from pork bones that have been boiled for hours and hours resulting in a stock that is milky in appearance with just some oily globs of goodness. Some blackened garlic oil added a nice contrast to the porky broth. Surprisingly filling and quite satisfying.We had some gyoza for starters which were a bit more solid with pork than the usual offering but still tasty.PS. The ramen isn't the mainstay of Cocoro but they do have it , a separate mini ramen menu and a minimum \u00a320 spend, it would appear.",

    "text": "Hm! I half really enjoyed my meal here and half didn't.I came with my husband and my parents. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The side dishes included in my set meal came first. They were really, really good. Next was the ramen, it came with the toppings on another plate and, like others I found this kind of weird and unnecessary. Also come ON for \u00a313 you can give me a little more pork right? Also I didn't get any rice with my set meal when some others on here did! Unfair. The noodles were very good, but the broth didn't do it for me. It was lacking in depth and that strong pork flavour tonkotsu should have. But it was definitely enjoyable enough and I'll pretty much put up with anything to get my ramen fix.My husbands enjoyed his spicy tonkotsu ramen but agreed that it wasn't porky or rich enough. My parents shared some sushi and loved it. It looked really, really good. My Dad said it was some of the best he's had outside Japan (and he's been a lot) although admittedly he doesn't eat a lot of sushi in London. They also shared some takoyaki which were a bit on the undercooked side but generous with the octopus.The only really negative note was the service at the end of the meal. Our waiter during the meal was lovely but the waitress who started clearing our plates before we'd finished rushed us, even though the restaurant wasn't closing. She even took my spoon while I was using my chopsticks and I had to get it back off her! She then came and took my husbands chopsticks while he was using his spoon.I'm definitely going back to try the sushi and with a richer, better broth and better service I could become a regular.",

(Can't blame him for that one... living 4 hours from the closest airport and then a 4 hour flight to the nearest ocean certainly doesn't bode well for the \"fresh fish\" campaign.) Let's just say he's an \"I'll have the chicken teriyaki\" kind of guy. We've gone for sushi together over 50 times, and this is always his go-to dish.But by the mid-point of the meal, I had a hard time keeping his roaming fork and fingers away from my succulent salmon sashimi, it was that fresh and delicious. It clearly didn't matter that he had never tried it before, it was literally so beautiful it beckoned him like a little salmon siren. To this day he still talks about the glorious Cocoro, and how it converted a Kansas boy to appreciate raw sea creatures. And that's nothing to throw an edamame bean at.",

Not a minimum charge would have beena problem as in an effort to show off my knowledge of japanese food we ordered quite a bit.The spicy tonkotsu ramen was just as tasty as I remember it. My main negative is that they are stingy on the pork they serve (two tiny slices) compared to Ittenbari where I had four massive slices of rolled pork! The broth however is incredible and I could happily slurp away at that all day. The spicy isn't that hot but adds a nice zing to your tongue which I quite enjoy.The dragon role looked beautiful and tasted just as good. Highly recommend it despite the \u00a315/roll price tag. The eel and cucumber was suitably scrumptious which fresh bbq eel (and quite a generous portion...none of that hint of eel that some places will give you). The takoyaki was good with lots of octopus although the sauce was a bit too heavy. Come the end of the meal, I was \u00a370 poorer but both of us were stuffed with food. The one main negative was how rushed the whole thing was. We hadn't even finished before they were asking if they could bring the bill and hovering around us until we left. Not a fan!",

The tuna was fishy, the hamachi delicious but stay away from the octopus balls-its a gooey nightmare! While the sushi cuts are nice, the quality is just ok. We had no problem with service but the people next to us got into a huge argument with management about their service and demanded to a free appetizer so maybe we were lucky. Overall, WAY too expensive for what it is. Soho Japan nearby is a way better deal for much better fish. You'll take a hit on atmosphere but you won't regret it when the bill comes.",

    "text": "Not sure if I came on a day where they just had a bad batch of noodles, but the consistency was very sub par..dare I say it was..doughy? Doughy as in, you bite into the noodles and it still has that soft pasty texture so that every time I ate a mouthful it was quite unpleasant. With every bite, I just kept asking myself - is it undercooked, overcooked, made with too much eggs/water, why you so sticky and pasty, ramen?! Then I was also internally conflicted with every bite because the broth was so good. So, my noodles were bad but the broth was oily, thick, flavorful soup. Yeah, basically I felt like a confused child who couldn't decide if I liked what I was eating. As other reviewers have said, they also refrigerate some of their food as they did with my appetizer (octopus with wasabi). Not that that's a bad thing - it reminds me of comfort food where your mom takes your leftover meal out of a fridge. It was a bit anticlimatic, however, to see them take my appetizer out of plastic tupperware from a fridge :|I've been excited to try out Cocoro for a long time but was slightly disappointed when I finally did :\\ Despite the flavorful broth, I think if the noodles were better, I would have given a better remark about my experience. After all, if I came to a ramen restaurant to enjoy said noodles, so it would have been nice to eat them cooked longer..shorter?...or made right..or something..I'm still confused as to what I ate.",

The highlight for me was the dragon roll - sea bass and avocado, all good, but the presentation was amazing! The roll was laid out as a dragon, with a rice head, spring onion nostrils, and lettuce for breathing fire. It's worth ordering just to look at!We also ordered some sashimi and sushi (all excellent, good selection, tasted great), some vegetable tempura, black cod in miso, and after that it all starts fusing together in my mind. The dragon roll naturally stood out as being excellent, making it hard to remember everything else. Personally, I thought that the takoyaki had too much mayo, but it's such a slight thing, so who cares?!Without drinking alcohol, the bill came to nearly \u00a3140, so it's pretty expensive (plus we really, really over-ordered), but well worth every penny, and every mouthful.The restaurant itself felt very brightly lit, but other than that the ambience was quite nice. The music wasn't too loud, the staff were very attentive, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. If I weren't moving to Japan in a week's time, I would go back here in a heartbeat!",

    "text": "Cocoro is a Japanese izakaya (a la carte) style restaurant on Marylebone Lane. A short walk from Bond Street station will take you to the southern end of Marylebone lane, where this Japanese restaurant can be found. Lunch menu here has never disappointed me. Between 18 and 25 per person, their lunch set is not cheap, but it's worth it.  Inside the small restaurant, you are greeted by the familiar scent of sushi rice from the counter next to the entrance. Mixture of pale and dark wood that make up of the room's overall tone creates welcoming ambiance. From their extensive menu, I chose salmon & salmon roe set. It seems everything on lunch menu comes with a few small side plates. In addition to the box-standard miso soup, my side plates consisted of spicy bean sprout, green salad and seasoned soba noodle. I think the most interesting among the three was the bean sprouts, which were spiced up with some red chili and vinegar. Everything comes in beautiful Japanese lacquered plates. So that's another way to enjoy the meal here. Salmon slices had beautiful streaks as you can see on the pictures. I'm never sure whether to pour soy sauce on top of the fish or use a separate plate and dip each slice at a time. I tend to mix and match but this time I didn't see a dedicated plate for sauce, so I decided to go wild and pour the goodness over the salmon directly. My favourite part is when you pick up a few pieces (balls? Grains?) of roes, place them on a slice of salmon, and roll it up like, well, a sushi. There is something special about biting into a delicious slice of salmon and discover a layer of these salty bubbles inside. So here you are. A little secret of Japanese dining. But I've never seen other people eating this way. So I'd suggest you practice with caution.",

I was seated at a bench facing the sashimi/fish counter. The restaurant was pretty bustling for a Monday lunchtime but service was quick and friendly. I had a long read of the menu - it does go for some pages. I eventually settled on the sashimi and tempura set - \u00a318. Quite pricey but I was pleased with what I got. I saw that other people were served their appetizer first, but for some reason all mine came out at the same time - the sashimi, the appetizer, the miso and the tempura. The gentleman next to me was laughing about (as was I) but I wasn't bothered too much - just making sure I had the tempura and miso first so they didn't go cold. I really enjoyed the appetizer, it was three small dishes of salad as well as one with salmon. These were a light and refreshing start to the meal. The tempura was good, but not the best I've ever had. Some of the vegetables seemed undercooked inside and generally I didn't love this part of the meal. The sashimi was of a better standard although I wasn't sure which pieces I got (it was 4 types of sashimi, two of each type) and there were definitely some which I wouldn't try again (if only I knew what they were!). With my meal I had a yuzu and honey tea (I think) which was delicious (oishii!) and had a beautiful sweet lemon flavour to it. I really enjoyed popping into Cocoro for lunch and next time I would definitely try the ramen after reading all the reviews here!",

The lunchtime menu is more reasonable - although the ramen is still expensive at \u00a313 for normal and \u00a314 for spicy broth, the set meal does also include a selection of 3 appetisers and a couple of slices of orange with your bill and crucially, there's no minimum \u00a320 charge. The only blot with service was that the waitress asked whether I wanted rice (included in the set meal) but never returned with it.I did also order some sashimi and can report some top grade super sweet scallop and wonderfully rich unagi (eel)However, the main reason for my update is the toilet! The unisex toilet has one of those famous Japanese toilet seats with controls for warm water jets etc. I wasn't brave enough to try it but if you fancy trying one in London, head to Cocoro!",

There are over 40 items that can be turned into lunch combos - quite the impressive feat. If you are visiting with a group, this means everyone can get their favorite Japanese food, be it tempura, teriyaki, sushi or oyako don. The soup and appetizer combo items make the whole thing feel like a deluxe bento reminiscent of the set lunch found everywhere in Tokyo. It's not the absolute tastiest or best value Japanese I've had, but this place pretty easily earns a solid four star rating. Check it out if you are in the neighborhood!I've been told the ramen is the among the best London has to offer and indeed found myself a bit jealous of my dining companions order.",

The table next to us was a group of loud, drunk Japanese businessmen, with a Japanese singer doing karaoke with them. We felt we were back in Japan! The sushi and sashimi was delicious, but the dishes are small and we couldn't stop ordering more. We got tempura, udon noodles, meat, everything!

The ramen was of a more traditional kind, more similar to Shoyu than other London ramen joints. They present the toppings (nori,etc) to you on the side so you can add what you like, when you like. I had the regular tonkotsu ramen. To summarise, you pay for the location, yummy ramen, but I'd go to Bone Daddies or Ittenbari (better price, good ramen) over this place for a ramen craving, although I'd go back if I were needing to eat in the area, for sure.",

Anyway, Cocoro is one of my favourites because it's got a book for a menu, and it's quite affordable. I've had the sushi here and it's amazing. Fresh, delicious, and unique. We've also enjoyed their ramen. Very nicely flavoured broth and they have a wonderful variety of vegetarian options. Always fresh, unique, delicious, well priced and excellllllent service.

Came during midday, so only their midday bites were available, but there's no disappointment there!!! \u00a0Had what was probably the BEST seaweed salad in my life. \u00a0It's not the neon green salad we've come to know in so many other places. It was a salad of at least 4 different kinds of seaweed, tossed with some sliced yellow bell pepper, rocket, and other veg and was refreshing and delicious. The pork (tonkatsu) was deep, earthy, and Rick in flavor. You can taste the pork bone in the broth. Accoutrements were brought out separately from the soup and you can add as little or as much as you like. \u00a0The pork meat itself, almost like a roulade, was seasoned and roasted first, then sliced for the ramen. Sooooooo good. Only downside was the ajitsuke tomago (egg) was a little overdone (yolk not runny enough for my liking), but flavor was very nice. Here's the best novelty. It's a Japanese restaurant, owned by...BRACE YOURSELF...Japanese folks. I love my Korean and Taiwanese brethren, but it's so nice to have this food dished up proper like this. Would highly recommend!!!",

I was able to get a table right away at Friday dinner hour, this never happens in San Francisco. - Great broth. Got tonkatsu ramen, the broth was very rich in flavour. - Decent noodle.- Friendly service. Not so impressed with:- Meat and egg. They came on the side. Pork slices was dry, and the half egg was fully cooked (I'd like to see egg yolk jigger pleeeease)- Price. Two bowls of ramen and a small salad came to a total of 40+ pounds. Ouch. It's a good idea to take a friend here on a cold winter evening, have a hot bowl of ramen then hit the nice wine bar next door. I'm not so sure about being a regular though.",

So I had high expectations. You know when everyone tells you something is brilliant, when you finally get to see it/try it, it is a big old let-down that can't possibly live up to your expectations? I was really worried that would happen here...I might have been saddened by unhappy noodles.But No! I was pleasantly surprised by the ramen's authenticity and sheer deliciousness! Yattaaaaa! We must have arrived on a particularly noodle-y day because by 7:30pm, the only ramen flavour left on the menu was tonkatsu(!) I had been dreaming of tonkatsu ramen all day, so didn't mind. It appeared with the delicious milky-looking soup and all the trimmings.*More amazing-ness* The drinks menu had everything!Beers: Asaki, Yebisu, Kirin and SapporoShochu (sake): They had pages and pages of the stuff! Both the Atsukan hot-sake and sooo many types of decent Shochu to drink chilled.Umeshu (plum wine): There was a whole page of umeshu to choose from!! It was \u00a36 a glass, so not cheap...but Oooh I want to try some more!!*The less good bits*- They have a strange rule about spending at least \u00a320 per person.- The gyoza, were nice, chunky and filling...but not very Japanese. - They forgot to bring the extra seasonings for our ramen until Kevin asked them about it (even though we had 8 bowls of ramen at our table - doh!)It might be hard to bring Japanese friends here...they would be shocked at the price for what is essentially cheap, happy food. However it was sooo nice to have decent ramen that Cocoro still gets 5 stars from me.",

When we're finally ready to order, we wait, then we wait a little more, servers are passing by us non-stop. Then we finally try to flag someone down, and they tell us to wait. Then we wait a little more, so then we try to flag someone down again. So you get the picture... it literally took FOREVER to get someone to take our order.Various dishes were ordered around the table, but I went for the Spicy Miso Ramen. When it finally arrived, all of its topping were separated from the noodles and broth. Not to mention, they seemed to be a bit sheisty with my toppings. I think I could have counted the little bits of corn kernels (approx 15 maybe)... which is pretty sad because I shouldn't be able to count them (at least not without going through a lot of trouble).Maybe I'll return one day because the broth was really quite good. Service really needs to be worked on here. Maybe they need more staff, but I could swear I saw some staff people not doing a whole lot.",
