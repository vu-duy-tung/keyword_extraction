    "text": "When I read about a Taiwanese bun house that had opened up close to work, I had to try it out. As I approached Lexington street I could see what looked like an ad hoc bus stop - it was in fact the queue for Bao! A bit anxious that this may take too long for a lunch break, I joined the ever growing queue. After a short while a Bao staff came out and took in the solo diners - including me!The restaurant atmosphere is cosy, and the staff members are polite. The menu is simplistic yet informative. I went for the crispy chicken with sesame buns with kimchi! Mmm! A small bun, but boy does it taste good! The peanut milk is also very cool and something I talk about at dinner gatherings a lot. Overall 4/5, as cost was a little high for what you get - getting there early for lunch is advised as the queue can grow very fast!",

    "text": "Great little place to go in Soho if you're craving some cheap and tasty small bites!We arrived at 8pm and there was a 30-40 minute wait. We followed suit with others in the queue who were grabbing drinks from the pub next door which was a great idea.. even if it did mean that we were a little tipsy by the time we were seated in the restaurant!We ordered quite a big variety of food as we were so hungry by the time we made it in. The spicy fried chicken and the pork 'nuggets' were pretty tasty. I'm not usually a fan of fried foods but the fried chicken tasted like good quality chicken breast (with no bones). We got an order of the sweet potato fries, which were coated in a light batter making them nice and crispy.My husbands favourite dish was the guinea fowl rice- it was very flavourful and came as quite a substantial portion. It does come with pickles on top which I found a little overpowering - I'd ask them to leave these off next time. My favourite dish was the scallop- it came served on a clam shell and had a really interesting zesty dressing!As for the bao, we shared a lamb bao and a confit pork bao. Both were delicious- the lamb bao has a Mediterranean flavour to it which I particularly enjoyed. We also finished with the ice cream bao. I have to say that I didn't love it.. but maybe I'm just not a huge fan of Horlicks..!Overall we had a really nice meal- we ordered one too many dishes for the two of us as we left feeling rather full! We will definitely be back, perhaps not at peak time as arguably I don't think it is worth a half hour wait...",

I remember thinking it was decent but not overwhelmingly better than, say, Yum Buns, which I love. I thought the restaurant was better than the stall. We had: Classic bun, pork confit, fried chicken bun, aubergine, house pickles, Taiwanese fried chicken, scallop. The scallop was tiny but really tasty. My fave buns were the classic and fried chicken buns, the tomato pickle, and my drink, a foaming (read: cream foam) cold tea. Really tasty. Bao was good, but I probably won't be consistently as it's not a ton of food for the price. But perhaps the occasional treat if you're not famished.",

    "text": "Only open a week and already a snaking queue at opening time for dinner tonight. That's partly due to the limited space inside this new restaurant but Bao have built a solid reputation from their previous ventures and there have already been some enthusiastic blog postingsI made sure to get there 20 minutes early and soon, the polite, friendly and very well informed staff were shepherding us to our tables. There's a mixture of small tables and counter seating. Decor is modern and pared down, which is reflected in the menuOrdering the Taiwanese street food is done by marking a menu card with pencil, which stays on the table. The staff then mark items off as the food arrives and you can use it to order more food. The eponymous bao come in 6 flavours, all explained on their own menu. I went for confit pork, which contained confit pork belly, pork sauce, hot sauce and dried shallots, all wrapped in their pillowy steamed buns. It was a lovely mouthful and the other diners on my table were going ga ga over the fried chicken baoThe staff recommended 2 dishes per person from the small plates section to accompany a bao. I chose the Taiwanese fried chicken with hot sauce due to my love of fried chicken. The thigh pieces had been deboned and fried in a crispy well flavoured batter though the smidgen of hot sauce could be more generousMy last dish grabbed at the extreme eater in me - pig blood cake. Described as Chinese black pudding mixed with glutinous rice, it arrived with an unexpected egg yolk on top. This dish didn't really work for me with the creamy yolk making the heavy cake taste even heavierHowever, there are so many more interesting dishes on the menu that I can't wait to come back and try. So, expect an update in the near future!",

    "text": "Don't be intimidated by the long queue...you're in for some gooooooood shit.The boyfriend and I passed by this place in SoHo on a Wednesday night. I walked up to the door and just as I was about to open it, the host grabbed my attention and instructed me to turn around. Behind me, the queue was going down the street...ha.Fast forward fifteen minutes later, we were in. I think parties of more than two had to wait a considerably longer time, because the place is quite small to accommodate too many people at one table. The service was great from start to finish. The place is more tapas-style, so go ahead and order 3 dishes per person, maybe 4 if you've becoming ravenous from the queue. The waitress recommended to us a great sake (which happened to be the most expensive one ha ha ha), and we tried two of their baos: the Classic and the Confit Pork. Both were on point. The sweet potato chips were too good as well.I've had the hyped Eddie Huang's Baohaus several times in New York, but I think this Bao is better. I'll be back next time I touch down in London town.",

So how was it?MMm I kinda like Bao as you can get stuff here which reminds you of SE Asia which you can't really get anywhere else around Central London.Highly recommended items to order:Peanut Milk (Yes, a glass of milk, with peanuts in it)Horlicks Ice Cream (This reminds me of Fried Man Tou (buns) which Chinese people use condensed milk to dip into)Confit Pork bun - I love the almond toppings, gives it that hint of sweetness, beware sometimes this gets oilyThe aubergine crisps are quite cool to order once to try.I didn't like pig blood with the egg on it, sorry.Fried chicken was too deep fried for me. Also it was quite spicy.Service is fast. Place is tiny. If they didn't have fast service that queue outside will be even more horrendous.Come in a pair of 2. You will then get seated quickly. If you turn up at 11:50am you will get seated even more quickly. If you get there at 12:05 prepare to wait 10 minutes. Don't think that if you come at 9pm you will get seated quickly. No, there will still be a queue outside. All day long.There is one toilet and the way you get in reminds me of toilets on airplanes. Interesting!?PS: The lady who deals with the queue is so awesome.",

    "text": "A solid 4 star place. Minus 1 star because they forgot some of the stuff on our order (twice), and let's be honest, this is pretty expensive place for what they serve. I'm from LA/SF and have been to Taiwan/China. These types of buns aren't rare in either Asia or California, so the price they charge here is definitely on the steeper end. Also, they charge \u00a33 for beef soup. Don't get me wrong, the beef soup is good, but I've had equally good soup for way less. But maybe it's just the cost of living in London (though I thought, coming from San Francisco, cost of living should be similar). We tried basically everything on the menu (pork, chashu, lamb, chicken, dessert). So while the price is a bit high for my taste, it was very delicious and I would definitely revisit. One advice: come early. We came by around 20 minutes before opening and was able to make it to first seating (on a weekday). By the time the restaurant opened, the line was around the corner, and it was gonna be at least an hour to get in (if you come at that time). If it's your first time visiting and you have company, I would suggest try everything if you can, and get probably 3-4 buns per person. Every bun tastes delicious.",

    "text": "An unassuming restaurant that we happened upon, as we were on our food crawl. Luckily we got here in the nick of time. 7 minutes later and the kitchen would have been closed.There's a great selection of items to try. Being on a crawl meant we limited ourselves to only 4 items. We went for the pickled veg, traditional pork bao, fried chicken and the fried ice cream holicks bao. We were not disappointed.When each of the dishes arrived in turn, there was something about the way the food was presented that made me feel excited to try it.Everything tasted exquisite. The steamed, pillowy, bread that cradled the succulent flavour filled pork is a must try item. The fried chicken was spicy and crunchy on the outside, yet meaty on the inside. The horlicks ice cream bao was the greatest way to round off the meal. The fried bread tasted like a doughnut and the horlicks flavour from the ice cream took me back to my childhood.The drinks, whilst small, were also worthy of a mention. We could see the bar from where we were sat and they looked to be made with great pride. I had a berry concoction whilst my fellow patron went for the lemon and lime To round it off we had the most lovely service, and it wasn't just the guy who seated us, or the lady who brought over our food or even just the lady who got us our bill. Everyone seemed to want to be there and provide a great service. Thank you for an amazing snack.",

    "text": "This place has had such rave reviews that I have been nervous it may disappoint - IT DIDN'T!I finally got to go midweek after work with a friend and even then at just gone 6pm there is a queue of 10 or so people waiting to be seated - it is a small (& popular) place so it is understandable The queue does move fairly quickly however so we only had a 15 minute wait (I have heard people have waited over 30 minutes). You have to have your whole party their before you are seated which is standard but to be honest I don't think the venue is suitable for more than 4 people and even then it is a push, just because of the seating arrangements.Once seated with your menu you tick which items you want along with the quantity and hand it to the waiter asap (sort of like Ping Pong?). The menu is split between Bao's, sides and then other dishes. All the Bao's sounded amazing so I was keen to try as many as possible and the other half of the menu isn't really my thing (pig blood cake, century egg, trotter nuggets, soup) so we tried nearly all the bao's (\u00a34-5 each) - Classic, Fried Chicken, Confit Pork & Lamb. We shared each, which is quite tricky as they are fairly small and there are no knives, but luckily we are good friends so don't mind! If on a date or with someone from work I would definitely stick to your own dishes. My favourite by far was the Lamb but also high up on the list was the Classic. We also got the sweet potato chips which were so good - super crispy!For pudding we got the Horlicks Bao - horlicks ice cream sandwiched between a fried bao (one each as that would have been impossible to share!) and boy was that a brilliant finish to the meal!We stuck with tap water throughout as weren't so fussed about trying their teas etc and in total it came to a reasonable-ish \u00a330 I cannot wait to go back!",

You pay 30$ for a noodle soup and buns at Momofuku tho. What I had: - scallop. Scallop is nicely cook. I was noticed the green powder around the shell, and I gave my best guess: it tastes like seaweed powder. Those gave the scallop more sea flavor, if you add some of those on your scallop. - pig blood cake. I think this is alright. - trotter nuggets. Trotter is a common Chinese like food. However, the meat is tender on this part but if you eat too many trotter, the greasy taste will overwhelm you. The sauce (with some wasabi and something else I forgot) complement with the meat makes it perfect.- classic bun. The peanuts make it more tasty. - lamb shoulder bun. The green sauce is a finishing touch. I feel like there had cumin flavor in it. Lamb always go well with cumin. I think the restaurant used a lot Chinese cooking style and integrate them into a more western friendly dishes. Brilliant. Definitely will go again.",

While there was a queue it was nice to have a Sam smith pint from the nearby John Snow while waiting. \u00a0After about a 25 minute wait on a Saturday night (less than the waiter told us) we sat in a cramped table and immediately ordered:Pickles- interesting flavors, sourClassic bao- good flavor combination of succulent pork and bread crumbs. Lamb shoulder bao- great meat and came with jalepeno kickPork confit bao- tasty but fattyBeef strips- disappointing dish, thin rare slices of beef with little flavor and far too much fat. Unfortunate as we were choosing between this and the fried chicken. Aubergine- tasty compote like dish on crunchy wonton. Ice cream bao- thought it was all fried, turned out to be creamy ice cream in between a fried bao. 2 Taiwan beers- at \u00a34.5 per can as far less than a pint, hardly a deal Overall the baos were tasty, as well as the aubergine, but for over \u00a340 for the meal, it seemed a little steep for street food. Also wish the couple next to us didn't comment o every dish we ordered.",

My only complaint was I wish there were more of the fermented greens. \u00a0The second was the fried chicken bao. \u00a0This one had far more texture than the first. \u00a0I liked how there weren't any crazy ingredients to out shine the super crispy chicken. \u00a0The last was the fried bao with ice cream. \u00a0This was super neutral and clean. \u00a0I think one more element really would have put this over the top, either something fruity or something with some texture. \u00a0Overall, we will always remember the amazing flavours that danced across our palette in the first restaurant that we visited in London.",

    "text": "Alright. You going to have to lineup but it's definitely worth it. This was one of the most delicious lunches I have had in London. Grab yourself a coffee/beer/champagne piccolo and lineup properly- make it part of your bao experience. When you get a table (yay!) you order from a cute Taiwanese style 'fill in the number' menu. Be hungry and order as much as you can if not everything. They will tell you which ones you need to order '1 per person' of. The space is teenie tiny so eat in pairs or three max or you probably won't fit. It's light and it has maxed out on space utilisation.On the menu you have 4 types of bao; classic (with a nice dusting of peanuts), confit pork (melt in your mouth pork belly), lamb (wow), fried chicken (which is more like a small slider). \u00a0and an icecream bao. You also have lots of delicious starters and sides. There are the most amazing mushrooms, peppery scallops, pig's blood pudding with an egg, trotter nuggets, an aubergine dip Taiwan style, fried chicken, beef and guinea fowl rice. Then there are sides of calvero nero with salted egg, pickles like you have never had them before and sweet potato chips. If I were to chose something to recommend then I would say all of it. The bao is soft and fluffy. There is a great spice through all of the dishes and there is a nice balance of fried and veg, soft and crunchy. All of the staff are great. The drinks list looks good. I'd start lining now...",

    "text": "I, or rather we, knew there was definitely going to be a queue. So the plan was to set \u00a0 the maximum waiting time and discuss coming up with a contingency plan. In the first 45 minutes we did not move at all. Then just as we debated whether to leave or not, the queue moved and we edged forward a teeny weeny bit. It was both encouraging and frustrating at the same time. Do we leave now or should we stay on? So, as you might gather, BAO does not take reservations. BAO has only 30 seats - all very cosy. Even the tables and chairs are mini size but were luckily, quite comfortable; a few stools around the bar, a couple by the window (one which we frantically prayed we never seated at because you are only a glass window away from the queuers. Hence, eye level when seating is the bum level of the queuer. But we were a company of trio so we were safe, phew!) and a few tables closer to the kitchen. The menu? BAOs were the star of the show but there are plenty of side dishes for nibbles; with the exception my fried chicken; it is a strictly no sharing dish for me. We ordered almost the whole menu except for the soup, scallop, pickles and the fried chicken bun. The dishes are small portions and were served as and when they were ready. There are quite a number of tea, beer and cider choices. No wine. Few non-alcoholic (I find) interesting beverages are foam teas and peanut milk.I love BAO in everyway. The entrepreneurs themselves are laudable. Growing from a humble beginning in the street food scene until a permanent location in Soho with queues that every restaurant craves for, they are a trio that still are as down to earth as any soil. When we left, an hour and a half later, there was still a queue.",

Scallops: just one piece and wouldn't order this again. Not great. Taiwanese chicken with ketchup: just regular fried chicken with ketchup over it. Wouldn't order it again. Horlicks ice cream bao: loved this. Soft bun and amazing ice creamTaiwanese whiskey: delicious. Must try Peanut milk: tasted like snickers chocolate and I could have finished a whole bottle of this. SOO GOOD!!! Would go back for the sweet stuff for sure. Cute place but could do with more of a variety. Excellent service.",

It is kinda overpriced for baos, but judging by the prices in London. it's okay. It is a more of a for foreigner/ westerner kinda place. I guess Chinese also go there because there's just not much choices of Asian food in London. Additionally, I just really can't stand the queue for such ordinary boas.",

Yup! I joined them!I was let in and it was very straight forward.. Sit down and write the quantity of each item you desire...short but sweet menu! I had the fried chicken Bao and the Guinea fowl chi shiang rice to begin with! HOW DO THEY PACK SO MUCH FLAVOUR IN SUCH MINISCULE THINGS!!?!? They were positively delicious! I also had some rose and honey tea which made me feel like the emperor of China!I was about to ask for the bill when I saw the words ... \"FRIED HOLLICKS ICE CREAM\" ..... Not even the Black Plague could've made me leave after that! I ordered it of course and it was deliciously sinful! The donut in my opinion could be a tad bit softer but the ice cream is to dieeeeeeeee for! Only criticism... The portions are a little too small in my opinion. I'm not a greedy guts or anything but if I pay \u00a35 for a chicken bun I want it to be at least bigger than my toe! And nothing there was bigger than that toe and NOOOO I don't have a massive toe either ..So one could argue the value for money point ... All together I paid \u00a319 for the three plates and tea.. It's an experience so if you want something different go there! But if you want to eat well for under \u00a320 ..not the place.",

Queues start at the opposite side of the road and lasts for around 30 mins.Inside it is toasty and cosy with basic ikea style furniture. The menu selection is pretty small - around 15 items to choose from. The waitress recommended we have 2 bao's each (a sort of Chinese burger) \u00a0and 10 other items to share between the 4 of us. We ended up ordering 2 bao's each and 7 items to share between us which was plenty!The items we ordered were a bit hit and miss (hence the 4 stars). The chicken bao was crazy delicious but the pork bao was too fatty and the lamb bao was just ok. From the shared items: again the Taiwanese chicken was delicious as was the scallops in yellow bean garlic, but the aubergine won ton was way too salty and the beef soup disappointingly unbeefy.Prices per dish range from 3-5 pounds, but they are small and add up quickly. Service was helpful and friendly even though it was rammed pack. Overall I'm glad we went but wouldn't do the 30 minute queue again!",

The super friendly staff sat me and didn't peep even if I said I was still waiting for a friend (and that friend turned out to be 15 minutes late), if you know how busy this place gets you'd know why this is a big deal. It was lunchtime and it was packed, and I hear if you come here at dinner you're very likely to find a queue outside the door. The place is extremely small, they've managed to cramp together a few tables so they might fit at least 15 people. Some of the seating spaces are around the bar, and at the end of the room there's the hole in the wall from which you can spy on the kitchen. I ordered a classic bao bun (they suggest at least three per head but...diet), one of their rump steak small plates (my favourite thing so far, even though it's probably no more than 50g of beef) and the mushroom and egg thing. Of which I forget the name. My friend also ordered the aubergine with the wonton fries and it was indeed tasty. One thing that really threw me off (but that's me) is that you could see they were washing glasses and they were LEAVING THEM OUT TO DRY WHEN THEY WERE STILL SOAPY. I do not understand why people in the UK do this. WHY PEOPLE, WHY U NO RINS?Anyway, I think it's super weird but they're not the only ones so not worth taking down another star for that. The one missing is merely because of how tiny the space is, and I do like a bit of space besides my elbows when I eat. Also, the portions are a lot tinier than what they seem on the pictures. Amazingly tasty though, will definitely go back.",

I already knew this place is always crazy busy with loooong queues... Eventually decided to give it a go as was finishing work relatively early, or lets say on time! Got there for 6pm.... Still too late, an hours queue on the other side of the road.... But we waited... Patiently... Ohhh, it was worth it! Awesome menu - a selection of 5 savoury baos & lots of little sides. Wonderful - the baos were great - we tried them all (except the veggie one!). Couldnt pick a favourite to be honest, porks are classics but chicken was surprisingly good and of course the lamb! Actually one dissapointment (aside the queue!) The ice cream bao. Really nothing interesting, super ordinary. Basically ice cream with a bun! Would have prefered anothet chicken bao :)Wonderful choice of sides as well - check out the photos to see what we tried, all wonderful! Couldnt pick a favourite either. Ive got to go back to have some more of the same and try the rest of the starters... But need to figure out whens the best time to go and not queue, im assuming weekend late afternoon... I dont know but i need more bao in my life! Side note to the staff - all particularly smiley and friendly!!!",

They were nice and brought out hot tea for the people waiting in line. There is limited seating so we had to all squeeze in. The food was good, but pretty expensive for what you got. I would say that you're better off going to Chinatown for value and taste.",

I tried the scallop, trotter nuggets, Taiwanese fried chicken, fried chicken bao, and fried Horlicks ice cream bao. The ice cream bao is to die for! I would recommend to order a bao for yourself and share some appetisers with friends. The restaurant is quite small but they turnover quite fast. We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and ended up waiting in queue (which is across the street from the restaurant) for only about 20 min.

    "text": "Mr Yelp London himself spoke of this place to me, I did;t know that they'd opened their own proper sit down place, so we gladly headed down. Since then, I've been there twice. As with I think, any other place on Lexington street particularly, in the heart of soho, they don't take reservations, (see: Mildreds, oh yes) it's tiny (even complete with a caravan style toilet) and amazingly delicious, do expect a queue. But, it's worth it, annnnd, if the queue is long, they're happy to serve you bottled drinks whilst you're stood there, which tends to keep people happy, and knowing that you get to stick your face in tasty buns at the end, makes it all worth it. When I say this place is small, it's not me being bitchy because I was born out of london in suburbia with sprawling countryside and big, grand old pubs, i mean it, shared tables, and bag hooks above you on the walls to save as much space as humanly possible. You quickly realise that you're sharing your personal space with other people, but it's pretty quick to get used to when you can smell the food...Paper menu, with little pencils, tick off what you want, sometimes there super efficient and hand this to you in the queue, if you're hungry, it's worth doing. Now you're sharing your safe-space radius, prepare to share your food, you don't have to, but I would recommend it, you want to try as many things you can off the menu. In the three times I've been there, I've tried:Trotter nuggets, *****Pigs blood cake, ****Fried chicken (this is very hot sauce, so you know),***Rump cap, ****Scallop, *****Aubergine wontons, ****Confit pork Bao, ****Sweet potato chips ****Daikon Bao, ****Lamb Bao, *****FRIED HORLYCKS ICE CREAM BAO *********With the ice cream, the bao is deep fried, hot and crispy, and the scoop of ice-cream inside, you are going to get sticky, the ice cream is going to try and jump out like those weird jelly sausage thinks you played with as a kid, just get in there, then lick your fingers afterwards. So good.They do run out of things, obviously the earlier you go, the less likely you'll have to queue or miss out on your faves. It's cheapish, definitely worth it.",

The wait was approximately 10 minutes, although that could be owing to the fact that it was 5:30pm. The restaurant itself is small, however, Bao manages to emanate a cosy non-claustrophobic vibe. I got the daikon Bao and was pleasantly surprised by the crispy crumbed daikon, which complimented the hot sauce and coriander very nicely. Being of part Taiwanese ethnicity, I am happy to note that the bun does in fact remind me of the traditional ones you find in Taiwan. However, those craving the \u00a0authentic peanut sugar may be hard pressed to find it. Only the classic bao comes with it, although the staff were more than happy to accommodate and give me some anyway! The serving size may be a little on the small side, though with the taste being that good and you being in LONDON, I say it is not bad at all. I highly recommend this place. Irrespective of whether you are a Taiwanese craving a taste of home, or just a keen foodie, Bao will deliver. FYI: They also sell cute bags too.",

Yes. Is it worth the wait and price? Maybe once awhile. The Pork Bao and Scallops were stand-outs for me. Ambience was easygoing and service was great.

I walk into the restaurant so happy and excited to see what a cool place this was, only to find out that there are 30 other people excited and waiting in line across the street! But the line moves quickly and we're in and order cocktail (not the best place to order drinks) and start ordering lots of small dishes and baos. The pickles are a must, order two or three of them as you won't want to share, very small, but you'll want more! The baos were just what I had imagined, salty, yummy meat with a soft sweet bun, yum!

Today, having done my due dilligence (incl waiting half an hour in a queue) I finally tasted what this place has to offer. As indicated by the rating it was worth the wait. Having tried some od the Bao(lamb and classic, especially the latter is wonderful mixing peanut saltiness with the full body of the meat), the Pig Blood Cake (dont let the name scare you off, it is fatty but tasty), Scallops (bite size), fries(nice twist to it) and the Ice Cream(delicious combo of vanilla ice cream and the toasted bao bun) I can certainly recommend this place. The portions are very small but each one is interesting, distinctive and delicious.",

    "text": "3.5 StarsI don't get the line or the hype. This place's main dish are the baos (braised pork, pork belly, fried chicken, lamb, daikon). Baos are something I see of more as a snack and not a meal.The scallop was a cooked scallop served on a shell, sprinkled with green tea powder and with some minced garlic on top.The aged beef rump cap was some thin slices of beef, slightly cooked but still get pink, marinating in some soy sauce.The fried chicken was round pieces of Taiwanese fried chicken with hot sauce doused on top.The classic bao was pork in shred in a bao (but I don't remember the taste of peanut powder, coriander, or pickled mustard). It tasted mostly of pork and the white bao.The confit pork was also quite porky. Again, I mostly remember the pork and the bun.The lamb shoulder bao had the taste of cumin and lamb, it was actually pretty good.The daikon bao was my least favorite bao. It was a rectangle of shredded daikon deep fried and topped with a single, thin slice of pickled daikon on top. I thought this dish was bland and boring.The horlick ice cream was pretty good. I liked the taste of the ice cream even though it was a bit too soft and runny. The fried dough sandwiching it on top and bottom was tasty but I liked it better eaten apart from the ice cream.Overall, all the food had a pretty good taste but it wasn't very inventive and not even very Taiwanese fusion. If this place had more menu items besides appetizers and baos, that would also make it more interesting.",

The best part of the classic was the bun which was super fluffy, the filling wasn't anything to write home about and luke warm.

They recommend to order 3 - 4 dishes and I think that's the right amount. Would cost you roughly \u00a315-18 including service charge. Also be prepared to eat next to a stranger as it's a small place and there's really limited tables.I love the tote bag with the man eating the bao.

The waiter kindly escorted customers in queue across the street in to the restaurant. \u00a0The seating arrangements were extremely packed and tight. \u00a0I figured it was all part of the experience (make sure you level your expectations in terms of elbow room lol) We ordered 7 baos (3 for the lady, 4 for the guy), shared Korean fried chicken small plate, had a bottle of beer, and a cup of milk tea. \u00a0That was perfect to share for two :) The bao: Classic (you may need at least 2 of these delicious baos) Pork belly (this and Classic are must have's for first-timers) Lamb Fried chicken (you're better off ordering the Korean fried chicken appetizer!) The buns were extremely fluffy and soft. Most buns I've tried end up with a slightly dry skin - but these buns at Bao remained soft even when the baos cooled down. \u00a0The meats were flavorful - I especially liked the pork belly with the fried onions (pork belly flavors really came out). \u00a0My friend was a huge fan of the classic buns because there was a variety of flavors. I'll admit this place came out more expensive than I expected but I still dream about the baos after returning back to the States. \u00a0:')",

    "text": "Ahhh, I'm conflicted on this one.I applaud Bao for taking a street vendor concept and making Taiwanese food instagrammable, adding modern twists with minimal compromise of authenticity, and their marketing prowess from the logos, the nifty dim-sum style ordering, and beautiful presentation stretches the price point to the edge of reason. \u00a0In other words, this is millennial Taiwanese food perfection, whereas the old school parents of the same target demographic would recoil in horror. \u00a0Being an Xennial, straddling between GenX and Millenial, I am cursed to see things from both perspectives. \u00a0 \u00a0It can appreciate the fact that it is a feast for the eyes but a mere tease for the stomach since even after spending around 40 quid for two, my companion and I were ready to head somewhere else for a complete dinner, and we are usually the type that gets full over one entree and one app split among the both of us.If I were to pick a few items for sampling, the fried chicken bao with the enigmatic black sesame bao and the fried bao w/ Horlicks ice cream are blissful bites, and the pulled pork and lamb buns are a little off the reservation but well executed. \u00a0The peanut milk is quite delicious although they are pretty stingy even with the volume on this nonalcoholic beverage (a small teacup's worth) \u00a0Perhaps if money and value was not a factor and I'm eating my heart's content on the company dime, there would be a 1 star bump, but knowing one can eat at least double the quantity of equal or better quality at less than half the price in Taiwan, it definitely detracts from the experience no matter how pretty and how innovative one modifies food offerings whose baseline is pretty close to perfection.",

Thankfully a friend got here early so I didn't have to wait but the line filled up fast at lunch and they didn't seem rushed to get us out for the next customer.Food came fairly quickly once ordered although any drinks will take awhile even if seated at the bar. I had a refreshing milk foam tea which is what it sounds like: oolong tea on ice topped with a thick milky foam that is fun to drink but steep for the small glass at \u00a34.The standout dish was the fried chicken bao. It came with a sesame bun, perfectly cooked chicken and kim chee with sauce. You will drool and you will devour it.The side dishes I enjoyed were the bbq scallop: note you only get one for \u00a33.75 which is overpriced but tasty. The aubergine dip with wonton crisps were yummy and best for sharing although I could have used more crisps. Skip the beef soup with plain daikon, a bit dull. My friend enjoyed the fried daikon bao but not as much as the chicken.Be prepared to pay more for small bites but leave full and happy. Personally I wish they would do take away so I could grab some bao and go.",

Despite maybe 20 people fitting inside and them having what seems like a rediculous amount of staff, they sure don't want to bring you the bill and flip the table quickly. 6. Gratuity is included I'm guessing because it's so oddly set up that you may not want to add it. We had a party of 4 that spent over \u00a370, and the first thing we did after leaving was go find a place to eat.

Plus, even if you absolutely hate waiting in line, it's gotten manageable enough recently that on weekdays, my party has always gotten in with the first seating so long as we show up before the noon opening time.As far as the \"xiao chi\" / small plates, IMO the fried chicken, scallop, and guinea fowl rice are the standouts. My favorite bao are the lamb shoulder and the original, although I find all to be quite good and I often disagree with my dining companions as far as our favorites. And obviously with my sweet tooth, I think it's a requirement that everyone should have the Horlicks dessert bao on every visit.I love that they have Kavalan whisky available too - make sure to give it a try if you haven't!",

    "text": "This place is delicious - definitely some of the best baos I've ever had in my life. Like the name implies, they specialise in baos, so I'd definitely stick to ordering that vs. trying other things on the menu. I found some of the other dishes to be hit or miss, but loved all the baos. Moral of the story is don't diversify in food selection - just get 3-4 of the baos and you'll be a happy camper. Your wallet will also be happier.First, the place is tiny so be prepared to wait in line, across the street from the restaurant. Don't come with a party greater than 2-3 people because you won't fit -- maybe max of 4 people, but it will be harder to get a table. I came at 1 pm on a weekday and had to wait about 15-20 minutes.Baos: I tried 2 of them, the classic pork and the pork confit (pork belly). Both were fabulous, but I liked the classic one the best because of the peanut powder on top. The pork belly was also really delicious and I loved the dried shallots on top - the pork belly meat wasn't overly fatty and it was really good. My friend had 4 of the baos and he liked them in this order (best to worst): classic pork, daikon, pork confit, lamb. The bread of the baos are the best, fluffy and soft so it feels like you are biting into The other dishes were fine, they were not terribly memorable to me. The scallop was good, but not \u00a33.75 good, for just one piece of scallop. I liked the fried chicken pieces but to be honest, I've had other fried chicken that is better, so I'd rather just save my stomach room for the baos. We also got the guinea fowl rice which had a perfectly runny yolk, fried shallots, and pork, and it was good but nothing quite to write home about. The biggest disappointment was the special that was roasted shrimp with green onions. We were told what the special was, but failed to confirm that it was a bao. To our disappointment, it was not. It was a bowl of tiny shrimp that you had to peel each one individually. For \u00a36 per bowl, it felt like such a waste of money, stomach space and time. We thought someone was pranking us and laughing at us in the back, watching us peeling tiny shrimp. My friend said the shrimp was the right size if you were a mouse. Needless to say, if this is the special, skip it. I had the fried bao with ice cream for dessert but didn't think this was anything super special. It was like eating a cold donut shaped like a bao with a scoop of ice cream inside. The ice cream was kind of a sweet milk flavor, and it was good. I love sweet things over savory but would have rather had one of the savory baos instead. In short, come here, with only 1 or 2 other people, expect to wait about 30 min or so for lunch, and get only the baos. Get all of the flavors that they offer for baos - they are all so different and delicious. It's not cheap though, my half of the meal for lunch ended up being about \u00a330 ($42 USD). I'd definitely come back here again though!",

The small format space reminded me of being in Tokyo and who doesn't want to be reminded of being in Tokyo?Also, being at the bar facilitated my ordering of drinks. I ordered a few of the bao including pork belly, lamb and fried chicken. They were pretty delicious and succulent. A bit on the pricey side for bao, but on the other hand that didn't deter me. Food quality was top notch, service was excellent, and the vibe was buzzy without being obnoxious. I also appreciated how the staff managed the queue to ensure diners inside weren't rushed or pressured while outside people queued up in an orderly fashion with an overwhelming and palpable sense of longing that made being on the inside feel so awesome!",

I was sat right away at the counter, given a menu & explained how their restaurant worked. I ordered some baos, fried chicken, and their pickles.The food was AMAZING - the fried chicken is a must get. I was so happy with it and could of eaten atleast 2-3 more platefuls of that. The bao was pretty good as well, I got the pork belly and it was a good mixture of salty, sweet & light.Only thing was the price was expensive, but hey, its SoHo and I was on vacation!Definitely try to go for lunch if you can -- you'll have little to no wait! I walked by one evening after eating and saw the line across the street. That's commitment!",

Not sure why they don't put a sign out so that they don't have patrons going in and asking for a table only to be told there is a long line across the street.I went around 2:30, to avoid the lunch rush but still ended up waiting about 30 minutes.I tried all of the baos expect the vegetarian one with Daikon. The best one I'd have to say is the fried chicken with the kimchi. However, I would not say that the baos here are that amazing, generally speaking. Its a cool idea, serving it in different styles, but in all honesty, I really like the baos I've had in a traditional Taiwanese restaurant and wouldn't necessarily go out of my way and stand in a long line to get a bao here. Also, my favourite dish is not even a bao, but the black pudding with the egg yolk on top, so rich so delicious. The sweet potato fries were good, I would call them sweet potato served tempura style.",

    "text": "I was very scared walking up to Bao because there were so many large crowds outside, but I wouldn't totally despair at this sight since a lot of the people are drinking outside the bars nearby and in line for neighboring restaurants. Given the crowds, it's also difficult to know where to queue; I talked to one of the servers inside and she led me to the end of the line, about 8 people/3 parties long, across the street. They also give you a small discounted drink menu that is exclusive for while one is waiting in line, which I thought was a good idea to keep diners engaged and high-spirited. Since all the drinks are just \u00a33 on this special menu, the spiked soda is the best deal. It tasted like generic red flavor and whatever alcohol was in there was not strong, but it was refreshing. My friend and I waited around 25 minutes total, not at all a long time when there is a lot of catching up and chatting to do! The menu is short and simple, which I appreciate. My Taiwanese friend back home said that the classic pork and lamb shoulder were a must, so I ordered those two along with the pork confit bao. My friend and I shared the fried chicken and trotter (pork) nuggets as well. The food came out swiftly. The classic pork was my favorite for its peanut crumb topping. I also liked the tender fried chicken pieces with its coarse crunchy breading. Since it's a small restaurant with tables very close to one another, it gets quite loud inside. Even though Bao is clearly very popular, there are no elite attitudes or egos--the staff are very friendly! The wait time was not ridiculous on a Thursday evening, and the whole process is smooth since they clearly have their operations down.",

But then felt after waiting a whole 5-10min we should aim to get more so also ordered the mapo eggplant rice bowl (btw, mapo eggplant! excellent idea! why has is this not everywhere?) and the fried horlicks bao for dessert.The lamb bao were awesome.The mapo eggplant was okay-good. The sauce was really good. Some of the eggplant wasn't cooked all the way through and was still a little hard. I would have liked more mapo sauce. I think you need to mix the sauce into the eggplant before eating, otherwise the eggplant can be bland. The fried horlicks bao was okay-good. If you like horlicks or are nostalgic for horlicks you'll like it more than an American like me.If you come with 2 people you'll be seated pretty quickly even with the line. More than that and you'll have a noticeably longer wait.",

BAO was a pioneer in London to expose the city to the namesake food, and they did it well. Creative flavours. That was 2-3 years ago - nowadays, places serving bao have mushroomed across the city, and having eaten at other places, I don't think I would queue for BAO again.The food is executed well, but not that hugely different/higher than what you could get at other bao specialists in London anymore.",

Mapo aubergine chi shiang rice \u00a36The classic bao is so good because of depth of flavor and textures. Wonderfully balanced savory tender meat with crunchy sweet chopped peanuts wrapped in a fluffy hot white steamed bun or bao. The Taro foam (light purplish) White Russian was sweet without being sickly sweet. This drink has no satiation point. You can keep drinking it and you still want more. Dangerous!There is an \u00a380 tasting menu where they bring you 1 of everything (possibly 21 different items). Excluding drinks. We ordered \u00a355 for 2 of us and that was plenty.",

    "text": "TL;DR: great place if you want to try lots of different flavors in one meal! Slightly expensive for the portion sizes, but fantastic plates. If you're hungry, you will definitely need to order at least two buns (and I mean it) because everything is portioned out for ant-sized people.Our waitress recommended two buns each (upwards of \u00a34.75) and 4-5 sides to share between the two of us. We followed this and it was a perfect amount of food. We tried the classic bao (the best of what we tried), the fried chicken bao, and the confit pork bao. We also ordered the Taiwanese fried chicken, the pickles, the nuggets, house salad, and the two dessert buns.The classic bao was by far our favorite and we will absolutely order again. The fried chicken is a must try as well, while everything else was good but not overwhelmingly delicious. The ice cream dessert buns were more of a donut texture but very yummy after lots of savory foods. Worth trying if you love bao buns and want a delicious meal. However, not sure it'd be worth the 30+ minute queue which can build up outside.Drinks wise: we only got the milky tea which was iced green tea topped with a whipped cream. Really refreshing!",

    "text": "I am Gua Bao crazy.Crazy for Taiwanese steamed buns.Soft, fluffy buns filled with mouthwatering ingredients.This is BAO.While in London last year, I made a beeline for BAO, an upmarket Taiwanese eatery located in the Soho area.The restaurant is small, yet cosy and staff are friendly and efficient. BAO doesn't take bookings, instead you have to wait in line... at a designated spot across the street, in front of a man eating bao. (Laughs).When I arrived for lunch on a weekday, the place was packed. Luckily, the service is quick (without the feeling of being rushed), so I ended up waiting in line for only 10 minutes.But, waiting in line for their bao is worth it.Their menu is simple. It consists of Taiwanese small plates - 9 dishes, 5 bao, 4 sides and one dessert bao. When ordering, you simply tick the box next to the dish you want and then hand it over to the wait staff.While I wanted to order all 19 dishes, I only ordered three - the Classic Pork Bao and Taiwanese fried chicken, and for dessert, the Fried Horlicks Ice Cream Bao.The Classic Pork Bao was perfect - a fluffy pillow-like bun of goodness, filled with pulled pork, fermented peanut powder and coriander. Melt in your mouth!The Taiwanese Fried Chicken with hot sauce was also very good - finger licking good. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.But my favourite dish was definitely the Fried Horlicks Ice Cream Bao - a must order when dining at BAO. It is a scoop of creamy malt ice cream between two sweet buns. Simple, but done well. Plus, it looks super cute!As of last year, I had not seen a dessert bao on an Auckland menu. Now you can get them at Auckland eatery Po'Brothers. Yay!BAO is the creme de la creme of bao. I would highly recommend eating here if you are in London. I cannot wait to go back, just so I can try more of BAO's creations!",

    "text": "BAO specializes in delicious and creative... well, you guessed it... baos. One of the best parts of this dish is the bread itself, and this restaurant serves it perfectly fluffy and chewy. The filling comes in a number of flavors. You have your classic pork and chicken, but then you also get interesting ones like daikon and ice cream. To balance out the meal, they offer a variety of small eats to select from the menu.While I love the concept of this restaurant, I don't think their prices are quite justifiable. I get that they can charge a premium, being in the heart of London and all, but the servings are definitely on the smaller side. It really doesn't cost all that much to make a bao either, so the math just doesn't add up for me.XIAO CHI// Scallop, Yellow Bean Garlic (\u00a33.75) - 4 stars// Beef Soup, Braised Daikon (\u00a33.25) - 3 stars// Eryngii Mushroom, Century Egg (\u00a34.50) - 3 stars// Aubergine, Wonton Crisp (\u00a33.75) - 2 stars// Guinea Fowl Chi Shiang Rice (\u00a36) - 4 stars// Taiwanese Fried Chicken, Hot Sauce (\u00a35.50) - 4 starsBAO// Classic (\u00a34.50) - 5 stars// Confit Pork (\u00a35) - 4 stars// Fried Chicken (\u00a35) - 4 stars// Lamb Shoulder (\u00a35) - 4 stars// Fried Horlicks Ice Cream (\u00a34.50) - 4 starsSIDES// Peanut Milk (\u00a32.50) - 3 stars",

Waited 15mins, that's Not too bad!Seems like they've put some new dishes on the menu! They even have a drinks menu with some interesting cocktails in thEre. This time we tried something new:1. House Pickles 2. Scallop with marinated garlic3. Fried Chicken BAO (a bit spicy and comes with sesame buns) new favourite4. Special: Chicken Wing Rice (wild garlic, curated soy egg yolk with macerated daikon) must try!!We also didn't miss out our favourites:1. Classic BAO 2. Shoulder lamb BAO 3. Horlicks ice cream BAO I think the queues run much faster than it used to, and they kitchen moves quite quickly too. This is still my favourite BAO restaurant :)",

    "text": "Firstly, I love this place. I had waited for Bao to open a proper place since discoering it in Netil Market in East London and their little food shack.Taiwanese street food, mainly of Bao bun form was a winner when I had gone to visit the market. Unfortunately like what seemed 100 others I queued up, in the rain, on a Saturday morning for what seemed like an hour. But I wanted to try this food bad. And boy was it worth it.So upon sorting a meet to try the new shop in Soho, I again waited. this time for an hour. It was like Groundhog Day. It's also the main reason why I cannot give this place 5 stars. It has ALWAYS got a queue. Whatever the time of day. Well ok maybe if you go about 2.36pm por something I'm sure it isn't as bad.But let me tell you about the food. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. At all. I loved it. All of it. My favourite being the lamb bao, blood cake with egg and the guinea fowl mix bowl. You could get anything and be happy. Though I heard a murmur that maybe the bao buns might be smaller here.I do love that they are social media happy, which means that they are very open to suggestions and a lot of 'off menu' items. So start mixing items...like putting an egg in a bao, or a blood cake in it, or doing something a bit photo worthy. If you ask nicely of course. And yeah, come as early from work as possible! Either that or bring a bottle of beer for the queue!",

    "text": "Warily eyeing the 40+ person line at 6:30 pm on Saturday, I silently cursed my affinity for instantly joining queues, even if it was to wait for a table at the very popular Bao. As soon as the host came out of the restaurant, I asked him how long the wait would be. He answered, \"For one I can probably seat you now!\". Sometimes, it pays to be a loner.I immediately went instead and perused the menu. The only bad thing about eating alone is that you can't order everything without looking like a pig, but I have no shame. I ordered the fried chicken bun, the pork belly, and the stewed pork. Out of the three, the fried chicken was the best with its sesame bao, and I wished I ordered another one. The pork belly was also delicious, and the stewed pork was nice but I would want to try something different next time. To top it off, I had the fried milk bun with Horlicks ice cream, and it was heaven. I am definitely coming back, with or without friends.",

The sweet potato fries with the plum sauce were also very delicious as was the scallop. The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars was due to the trotter nuggets, while they didn't taste bad they didn't taste like much except fried food. Other than that food came quick, service was friendly and the food was good!",

    "text": "After the much anticipated wait, Bao has finally opened their Soho restaurant!I ordered the peanut milk, which came served with ice in a small glass - it was really tasty and refreshing, and I could have easily downed a couple more glasses.Their menu is divided into three categories: 'Xiao Chi' (\"small eats\"), Bao, and Sides.The scallop was fresh with fragrant flavours from the yellow bean garlic. I find soup dishes very comforting, and I would highly recommend the beef soup, which seems to be a favourite amongst many who have tried it. The aubergine was really soft and smooth, and it was fun to eat it with the crispy pieces of wonton skin. Their pig blood cake which many had raved about was actually really tasty. After watching multiple videos and 'before and after' shots of that gooey egg yolk, I finally tried it for myself. It had a pleasant texture, and it was really moreish - another favourite from the menu!The trotter nuggets had a light and crisp golden coating with deliciously tender meat inside - so good that I had the whole dish to myself.The guinea fowl chi shiang rice was topped with a bright yellow egg yolk which was great to eat mixed together with the rice.We ordered three different savoury baos - lamb shoulder, confit pork and the fried chicken. I have only ever had their classic bao from their market stall, so it was nice to try a few more variations, all of which I enjoyed. It was hard to choose, but my favourite amongst the three was probably the confit pork bao.And of course I couldn't pass out on dessert which was the Fried Horlicks Ice Cream. It was interesting to see Horlicks being used which was more of a childhood drink for me. It is however not the easiest thing to eat without getting your fingers smothered in melted ice cream...At the end we washed it all down with some foam cold-pressed tea which was really refreshing.The food has definitely lived up to the hype and it is of no surprise that there have been queues of people outside.I will be back for more...Click on my blog link for the full post with photos xdancing-in-high-heels.bl\u2026",

    "text": "Has anyone played Chubby Bunny Cheeks here? I wouldn't mind if you mistook me for a person who could probably eat enough to qualify as a contestant or thought I was able to confidently enter any sort of competition involving winning a prize for eating whilst reigning triumphant. Bao down to me. Sometimes I can be greedy. Especially if the food is delicious. I'll take you back to summer camp, the mid 90's. I was wearing Hammer pants, an Ace of Base T-Shirt and a waterproof pink and orange neon Le Coq Sportif cagoule. (It was England, so of course there was drizzle). My kinder gang and I had successfully collected enough kindling to get a crackling, cheek roasting, polyester-cagoule melting, roaring fire going. It was at this life transforming event that I was introduced to marshmallows, but not just any marshmallows, these were brought by our exotically tanned American, camp-leader Justin; Prince of all Knots, all the way from the land of Shee-Cahr-Goh. This miraculous bag of giant, child's fist-sized puffy white clouds of powdered sugar were toasted in a fire, where the gelatine emulsified creating globules of sweet crispy toasted candy which dripped down my twig just savagely ripped off a nearby tree, glorious. \u00a0Hot strings of melted happiness. The reason I fondly recalled this memory at Bao, was I believe, a survival technique that kicked in. A happy place I went to when, I was served... tiny preschooler-fist-sized scantily filled \u00a0steamed rice buns.Back to camp nostalgia. I was thoroughly enjoying the, little did I know, to be revered experience until I recalled when some fool of a child said: \"Bet you can't stick 4 of those in your mouth at once\". Before I knew it, 8 year old Craig and I were at war. Stuffing our mouths with mallows in a competition of 'Chubby Bunny Cheeks', where the object of the game is to stuff as many marshmallows into your mouth in a game of one-upmanship in speech articulation. \u00a0\"Tschubby Buhnny Scheeks\"! I exalted, stuffing a 8th in to match his 7th. It was his turn next.\"Kubby Bungy Keeks\"! He yelped victoriously.'Kubby Bungy Keeks is not the game\", I intensely corrected. \"I win\".I went in for the kill with the 10th while sugary saliva dried in my hair and dripped down the middle of Ace of Base. I'd won. Justin, supervising, helped me raise my fist-punch into the air triumphantly. However it was to be a bitter sweet victory. We could no longer toast the mallows on the fire as we'd eaten them all.The moral of the story is that Bao steamed buns are slightly harder to play Chubby Bunnies with, needless to say, I bet you've probably wanted to. Although the little steamed poppets look like teeny, you'd probably fit about 4 into a standard sized mouth, so it's potentially an expensive game at \u00a35-\u00a36 quid-a-pop. Another little trip down memory lane incurred after trying Bao's darling little trotter nuggets. I'd have fayre like trotters at my nan's as a kid. Delicious and she'd laugh her bloomers off at their reintegration as 'hawte kwizine' today. I'd often stay with her and I fondly recalled having the them for tea on my return home from camp sodden with mud and full of flu. Now due to that dratted Jamie O having outlawed anything nugget or twizzler shaped, I haven't been able to get my hands on anything processed or nugget-like since. So thank you Bao for taking me on a trip down memory lane, to a time when nuggets were a currency and nothing to be ashamed about. I'm proud to have been one of the first in the queue to get served. Only a mere half an hour of an undignified wait to get in at 5.30, much like waiting in a school lunch line. In Soho. Whilst cool people with table bookings elsewhere walked by in bemusement of the line forming behind me. So the last little touch I liked, was what really I needed to get me in the spirit of things: sitting on child sized furniture and eating kiddie portioned food at adult prices. Although I loved the coat pegs on the walls! It've been a nice touch if once I was through the door, they could have labeled it with my name and a picture of my nursery school totem creature; the unicorn. Now, where can I find an old fashioned sweet shop so that I can remark on how a packet of foam shrimps, cola cubes and a few flumps no longer cost 25p but the amount I'd spend on a dessert at a La Gavroche. Chubby Bunny Cheeks anywhere else, anyone?I'm game.",

The waiting queue is across the street which is slightly unusual, but the hostess is very good at keeping track of the queue and letting people know realistically how long the wait might be.",

For 1 hour.I had visited the stand in Hackney several times and have bleated to anyone who would listen about the dreaminess of their fried chicken and how excited I was about their first restaurant. I am happy to announce that this place is freakin' awesome and totally worth the wait! I liked the minimalist interior, the tight seating hardly distracts you from the amazing food, I sat looking at the toilet for goodness sakes! I was still extremely happy to be there.We ate many things.....scallops in glorious garlic sauce, fried chicken is still great, trotter nuggets were cute and yummy, the lamb bao was delicious with many layers of flavour and fun. We also enjoyed the guinea fowl rice but wanted to eat everything on the menu, twice over! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the sweet potato fries, they just seemed abit random and didn't have the same flavour offerings as anything else.Peanut milk is offered on the menu and we were advised to drink it with the savoury food....which didn't work at all. However, as a separate drink? Delicious. We also tried the cold foam tea, so weird, but nice.Service was good, friendly, informative, interested, not slow at all, the table space is not huge, so actually, dishes coming out in a staggered manner is perfect.People were asking us if the food was good, what type of food is was and how long we had waited for whilst we queued. My advice? Come to Bao, eat, enjoy and feel happy. I can't wait to come back. Just at a quieter time!",

    "text": "I had heard about BAO online and had two friends that lived in shanghai and Singapore who wanted to try it out so we headed down to Piccadilly Circus to look for the famous bao restaurant. We had a sneaking suspicion the line across the street was not for the pub or the health food shop on either side of it, and a very friendly waitress confirmed that we would need to wait in line for about 45 minutes, as they had just opened and the whole first wave of people had to finish eating. As we were on a mission for bao, we decided to stick it out. It was a sunny day so waiting in line wasn't too bad, and we were given a menu to look at while waiting. The only item they were out of was the fried ice cream. Once seated, I admired the minimalist decor and efficient ordering system (you mark what you want on a paper and hand it in- they were great about me writing in a request for no kimchi on my fried chicken bao!) I highly recommend the sweet potato chips with the sauce and the peanut milk. My friends had the classic bao and the pork confit and seemed to love the pork. All looked amazing though! Another girl that came with us had a nut allergy, and the staff were wonderful about giving her safe foods and passing the information along to the kitchen as well. Amazing and fast, efficient service (once inside) and really friendly, cool waiters and waitresses! Love it and will be coming back!",

Overall it appears this little number is well know tourist destination spot and u may have to queue a little outside.

The line is across the street in front of a sign with their logo. The wait goes by relatively fast though. 2. Fast: The food comes out super fast once inside - with that little space their service is top notch. While in line you might be given a menu to mark down what you want to quicken the pace.3. Tiny: The place, the food. The bathroom itself is a little larger than an airplane toilet. Make sure you order enough - the bao's are about the size of your palm. I ordered a tea, and the pot was about the size of a Bao as well. Seriously have never been served a drink so miniscule before. You just look at it and are you like - is this a toy? What. 4. Satisfaction: Everything I got here was very good. I would recommend getting the Confit Bao, Pig Blood Cake, Sweet Potato Crisps and Horlick Ice Cream.",

    "text": "I went here with a small group of friends - one of whom who had already been. As such, we got a good idea of what this place was about. According to my friend, Bao started out as a small-time market seller who received financial funding only recently. The result is that Bao is the hottest Taiwanese \"designer\" cafe in London currently and the extraordinary queue across the street confirms. Apparently, there was a two-page spread in the Telegraph on how this business grew. Queuing can take as long as a half hour for 4 people but it's worth the wait so plan in advance! They do not take bookings. The menu itself consists of \"small eats\", \"Xiao Bao's\" (Small Bread) and \"sides\". Unsurprisingly, many people come here to try the \"Bao's\". The menu doesn't lie when it says the Bao's are small - I can probably eat one in less than 2 minutes so it is advisable that you get at least 3 or 4 to be satisfied or a combination of different dishes. Being new, I was recommended the \"Classic\" which was a Bao filled with Pork Confit. Admittedly, it tasted more like pulled pork but it wasn't disappointing as the meat was so very tender and surprisingly quite light. I liken the Bao to the taste of Mantou (\u9945\u982d) so expect it to be very sweet tasting.The next Bao I tried was Lamb Shoulder with picked chilis - this was much nicer so I highly recommend this one. The spiciness is average and the lamb comes in tender chunks. Most definitely, I'll be getting this next time again. I read a previous Yelp review to try the Sweet Potatoes I was keen to try these. I don't find it anything special but it's a good dish to share around the table as a starter. Note that these are fried. \u00a0I think my favourite dish was the Beef and Daikon soup. It's light and very brothy - you don't get anything in the soup besides 3 small daikon sticks which tastes like they're supposed to taste like. The soup itself is very tasty with just the right amount of salt added and an explosion of sweet onion.",

It is defintely not suitable for large groups here but a place to consider for one or two people.When you finally do get a seat, you would place your order by filling in a order form and hand it to one of the staff. The menu is broken in to three section - small plates, bao and sides.The drinks are on a separate menu and there are a selection of hot or cold oolong tea. The hot oolong tea is served in a small clay teapot. You will see the staff use a timer to brew each tea to work out when its ready to seve.When you visit BAO you have to order at least one of their bao which is what make them popular. There is different fillings to select including Fried Horlicks ice cream, which is deep fried bao (instead of the steam bao) with Horlicks ice cream.The steamed bao are soft and fluffy. The Classic Bao consist of braised pork with fermented greens and peanut powder. I preferred this over their Confit pork bao consisting of pork belly with a hot pork sauce and dried shallots. Eating bao can get a bit messy but don't freak because you will get wet tissue to wipe your hands. One of my favourite on the menu is their Scallops with yellow bean sauce which cost \u00a33.50 and come served in its shell.Guinea Fowl Chi Shiang rice for \u00a35.25 comes served in a small bowl which make it great size as a small plate. You can consider having one of these rice bowl and a bao, instead of muching yourself through lots of bao to get full and have your money draining away quicker.",

Quickly the line became very long - so try get there early if you don't wanna wait.Inside is very small. Although not cramped you're very close to other people. Not a problem for me, to be honest, but we were sat next the worst couple ever - the GF was too loud and actually the worst person I've encountered in a long time. I won't go into it too much butttttt they were annoying and distracting. :-)Staff are very friendly and everything is served quickly and promptly. #WinThe food is very good! Like very very good. The bao were tasty - we had the classic, lamb shoulder and fried chicken. I liked the classic a lot - tender pork with amazing flavours. The fried chicken was lovely also. I didn't enjoy the lamb as much - I thought it was a bit too spicy and oily. The beef strip was amazing! So tender and the flavours were subtle but delicious.The trotter nuggets were great. I'm guessing by the name it's pig foot meat that shaped my fried nugget. The sweet potato chips were good; chunky, battered and had a nice drizzle of hot sauce on them. Now here's my problem. The portions. And I am not a big eater. The bao are much smaller than the pictures suggest. I can easily pick one up with my forefinger and thumb. The server recommended 2 each but I think at least 3 is needed.The beef strip is not a strip but more tiny patches of meat - delicious delicious meat, did I mention. The trotter nuggets were okay - I think about 4 of small nugglets were in a portion. The chips - there were no more than 10 fries in there. C'mon! So to conclude, I like Bao. I really like the food. I just can't eat here unless I plan on eating afterward or if I eat 4-5 buns and 2 starters each.",

A friend and I ventured over at around 2 pm and all the seats were full, but we were the only ones in line so we got seated after about 2 minutes. They immediately gave us the menu and we marked our orders on the provided paper (an interesting but efficient system).We ended up going for the classic bao, scallop, guinea fowl rice, and the fried ice cream (dessert) bao. The scallop wasn't my favorite - the sauce was too salty, and I personally don't think it was worth the 3.5 pounds (especially since the dish came with literally only one scallop). The guinea fowl rice was just alright, too - nothing special in my opinion.You might be thinking, then, why 5 stars? PURELY BECAUSE OF THE BAO. The classic bao - oh my god. It was absolutely FANTASTIC. The different components - braised pork, vegetables, peanut powder - combined incredibly, and the resulting taste was heavenly. The dessert bao was also really good (although I may be slightly biased because I'm a huge fan of sweets) - not AS good as the classic bao, but still definitely worth getting.Words cannot capture how much I loved both the classic and dessert bao (but especially the classic). I will for sure be back for more! Some notes for future visitors (which I highly encourage): the place is tiny, the service is quick, and the food (especially the sides) are slightly overpriced in my opinion for the serving size - with the exception of the baos. Which are completely worth it.",

    "text": "Lovely little place serving lots of baos. We waited for an hour (AN HOUR) to get a table on a Friday evening. Once in, food was served fast, and things ran efficiently. We ordered the classic, pork confit and chicken baos. Also had the scallops, soup and aubergine as starters. Everything was rock solid -- appropriately delicate but also no-frills. I particularly liked my pork confit and chicken baos -- very flavourful with just the right combination of everything. Service was good, though I felt like some of the staff were bossy at times. I hope its early success doesn't get to their head. The place is quite small, so don't expect to linger their for any meaningful conversations. It's a bit of in-and-out type of place. Still, very good for baos.",

Queueing for 20 minutes before getting inside!Surprisingly the cheapest dish turns out to be the best one on the menu the classic bun and the sweet potatoes!I order myself blood pudding cake, classic and confit pork buns, sweet potatoes fries, grill mushroom with century egg and order the lamb bun and and fried chicken according to the waitress's suggestion which is a the worst two dishes among all the food! I love the sweet potatoes fries! Very unique! The blood cake at the first was good and then it become too fatty for me. The confit pork is not very flavourful as it was described by others. The lamb bun got nothing special and the chicken was tasteless",

The queue always put us off -(restaurant is so small that waiting is outside over the road where a Bao bus stop resides, I guess not to annoy the pub patrons next door). Even on a Monday, there was a queue before the lunch service! But must say it has Lived up to the hype! Super Tasty and interesting flavours. \u00a0We tried each and every bao available and was not disappointed. \u00a0Will have to order a fair few if you're there for dinner! \u00a0Drinks are tiny, but everything about the place is on point. \u00a0You see why the queues are long. \u00a0Many similar places are beginning to open up ..

    "text": "The First time I tried Bao burger , it was in Paris (Siseng restaurant) so when I saw in London they have a popular Bao place , for a food lover like me, I went and tried! And no disappointment at all! It was quite different to what I have tried but still as good! We had various little meals we shared : aubergine, fried chicken , scallop (difficult to share this one but still have tried a tiny bits) Guiana fowl rice and sweet potatoes fries. All were delicious and worth to try. Now the Bao: we all went for 2 Bao each as suggested by the waitress. We found them small when we saw them first but it was actually just right if you take into account the starters (if not for a big eater like me, it would not have been enough) . I have tried the classic pork Bao, the fried chicken Bao and the lamb Bao! All of them are EXCELLENT! They are really flavoured, \u00a0with the right amount of spice Tips: if you don't like spice, that might be difficult for you to eat as it might burn quite quickly but if you can handle a little bit of spice you will be fine! My favourite Bao was the classic one. The braised pork was sooooo good! Then the chicken, the sauce they put in it was really really good and the chicken perfectly fried. And I love the bread, like my friend said it is so soft and light , it's like eating a cloud (like she knows how a cloud taste ) And finally, we tried the ice cream Bao. That was original. Other tip: if you are like me with sensitive tooth and you can't bite on an ice cream, ask for a spoon to eat it. The ice cream was nice, the warm Bao that come with it as well but I would rather get another salty Bao than this dessert. Not a problem if you don't try it! Oh and I almost forgot the drink: I went for the cold tea with with peach and verbena. So refreshing, the perfect summer drink even if I went there end of September but who will say no to a fresh and refreshing \u00a0drink. That's it, I can't sell this place more than with this review and the pics!Final tip: go there either at 6.30 or after 8.30/9 on a Monday, the wait won't be long! And if you have to queue, do it! The food is worth the wait!",

Admittedly, the first time I went I tried all of their bao varieties and was actually a little underwhelmed, thinking that going permanent meant they'd sacrificed some of the quality of their food.On the second time though, we worked our way through the starters menu and I was blown away. The aged beef rump cap is hands down, one of the BEST single dishes in London I've tried. \u00a0The classic Bao is actually not their best I think, I much prefer the braised pork or the lamb!And avoid the drinks - overpriced for the size of the pot/glass you get! Besides that though, well worth getting in here if you can and don't mind queuing for the opportunity!",
