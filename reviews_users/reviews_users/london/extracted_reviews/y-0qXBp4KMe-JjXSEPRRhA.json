So you can find there pretty much anything you are in the mood for. And everything comes with amazing food presentation and taste. On top of it there is the outstanding 6 star service and always beautiful fancy crowd. It's the \"IT\" place to hang out and eat at in London (again, according to my experiences; best in the world). Unbeatable!",

Complimentary drinks were provided to soften the blow but having to stand around the bustling bar was certainly not ideal. When we finally got seated, we were treated to a wonderful asian meal with lots of good portions of flavourful food. There was lots to choose from for vegetarians and the attentive and friendly staff were more than happy to help to pick out the best of these. I understand that these days it's quite 'cool' and 'hip' for the lights to be low and music loud - much like a culinary version of an Abercrombie & Fitch store, but after a while it did become tiresome having to shout across the table just to hold a conversation.",

Prices are really high, but it is called the best restaurant in London, so you can't really expect something else. Choose this for a special dinner and you will get a chance to feel the excellence in everything - food, service and surroundings. Always crowded, reservation is definitely needed and do it as soon as possible!",

    "text": "This was the 2nd time I had dined at Novikov Asian restaurant, but most certainly the last. We had a reservation at 915pm for 6 people. We arrived and checked in at 916. They told us \"your table is almost ready, please wait for a moment at the bar and we will call you when it is ready\". The bar was packed with people and I noticed in the next 20 minutes that no one was being taken to their table. So I went to inquire again. \"Just a few more minutes\". Look, I said, we are here for my friend's birthday. We have been waiting 20 minutes, how long will it really be? \"About 10-15\" she tells me. We waited an hour and 5 minutes. If she had said about 30 minutes, we would have left. Instead, we stayed because the manager came over and took our coats, was very pleasant and gave us all champagne cocktails on the house for the birthday. Ok, so we kind of forgive them for making us wait (kind of). We finally are seated, the food is good, no problems there, but it came out super fast. Almost too fast. Like we were being rushed. Then we order coffee and dessert. Two bites into the dessert, a waiter comes over and whispers, \"We need the table back, would you mind moving to the bar area. I will bring over your desserts.\" Excuse me? No, we do not want to wait in the overpacked bar. We will finish here. He leaves. 5 minutes later he is back. \"I'm sorry, but I have pressure from the next clients that they want the table now. Would you like me to get your coats?\" What about your present clients?? Fine, save us a trip and go get them. We give him the ticket and he comes back one coat short. He fights with us that there was no other coat. He goes to check and lo and behold there it is. Now he tells us, \"Ok, now you have your coats. Please follow me to the bar, I will give you each a glass of champagne on the house but your two hours are up.\" (We had been told several times upon booking the table, that we have it for two hours only). Now I am mad. \"Yes, we have been here for two hours, you are correct, but we have been seated at this table just under one hour because you made us wait so long at the bar. No i do not want free champagne. What I would like is to finish this outrageously expensive meal in peace without being bothered by you anymore. We have a whole hour left and intend to use it. Suffice to say, the entire experience was awful. We were all mad the whole evening and the birthday girl was upset. We will not be going back ever.",

We went to this place with some colleagues after a training based on a recommendation and in the end I left the place with a bitter sweet taste due to the hole in my wallet. So to be fair, the food was pretty excellent. We had fantastic sashimi, great fish with some turmeric seasoning as well as some really good sushi rolls. Our wine was pretty delicious as well. However what really did not sit well with me was the price. I know it is London and yes things are expensive here but no dinner in the world is worth 120 pounds per person. And we had not been really asked by the staff what we were looking to spend and/or eat, I know they are salesmen and want to give us a good time and make good money. But in the end the price-value ratio was really not worth it. The ambience of the place I would rate as ok but not particularly great either to be quite honest. So all in all, I probably wouldn't come here again but if you have infinite funds and want to be spoiled maybe this is not the worst place to go.",

You can't miss out on the wagyu tacos probably one of the popular appetizers on the menu . It was so good we ordered 3 orders and the sweet and sour chicken amazing , the kimchee fried rice we ordered it with chicken. Everything on the menu was very very GOOD ! the service was also awesome the server was awesome on the first night the only downfall I had is the server the next night we went didn't give us last call and when was closing couldn't bring a Coca Cola because they didn't sell it we continually kept asking which left my friend without anything to drink with his meal .

It's definitely a very busy, hip place to be but the service isn't very good, the food is a hit or miss depending what you order, but the drinks are always good.For the Italian dinner I've had the beef tartare, the white pizza, langoustines with garlic, and Bronzino cooked in foil with clams which weren't bad but not amazing. 2 dishes that were really good were the Pappardelle with Bolognese and the Whole Bronzino cooked incrusted with salt. The sauce and pasta were very fresh and the fish was cooked to perfection unlike the Bronzino cooked in foil.Overall I like the scene and the food is ok. Next time I'll have to try the Asian side.",

The quantity is quite poor but not ridiculous.The best point is the after dinner-lunch downstairs, it has a club to have drinks and try to chat up with...whoever you want.It is a very funny place to go with friends and a global experience if you want a easy transition between the dinner and the drinks.",

Ask to sit near the glass tween you and the art-like baskets of fish and veggies. Amazing colors and textures. And a view of the awesome kitchen at work. People watching is a plus in the Asian side.

    "text": "Novikov is Arkady Novikov's rather over the top outpost in Mayfair. With 2 separate restaurants (Asian and Italian---more to come on that) and a bustling underground bar, all in one gigantic space, Novikov might very well be London's lagest restaurant.The Italian restaurant in particular was overly showy. It can only be described as Vegas-like. Seriously, it looked like a fancier version of a Vegas Cheesecake Factory in epic proportions.Alas, I ate in the slightly more understated Asian section of the restaurant. The Asian menu is diverse and offers a countless selection of dishes that pan most pacific rim countries. Overall the food was well presented. I really liked the Malaysian pork buns, the grilled rib eye and some of the sushi rolls I sampled. However, we also ordred the grilled unagi...at \u00a344 it's one pricey piece of eel...unfortunately it was as disgusting as it was pricey. It tasted like galvanized rubber. I rarely rarely send back a dish, but this one had to go back. The reason though why I'm giving Novikov 3 stars instead of 1 or 2...is the response from the restaurant. The GM came by to apologize and offered to comp the eel and gave us some free sushi rolls. A few moments later the chef also came by all apologetic. he said he tasted the eel and said we were correct that it was definitley not right and something was wrong with the charcoal and to him it tasted like lighter fluid. He was genuinely apologetic. 2 minutes later he returned with some unagi nigri to show us that he could make eel properly. To Novikov's credit they handled this situation perfectly and I left with a much better (and less burnt rubbery) taste in my mouth.Overall, Novikov is overly flashy and expensive though for some people that might fit the bill. Hence the 3 star rating.",

This place has great food, both in the italian section and the asian section, which is why I return all the time. Yes of course it's pricey, but you know this going in. Their sea bass and bream are always outstanding, as are the lamb and all the raw entrees, the wine list is extensive and the wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Also, the desserts are Jesus, and I never use this word lightly. So back to the three stars. For me, it's the people, the sleazy bar downstairs ( though the music is cool and I shake my booty like JLO's spirit animal), the bevy of call girls, mannerless tourists, baby blue Ferraris out front and above-the-muscle saline boobs. It makes this experience cheap for me, and I hate it cause they have this one passion fruit dessert that is the panty dropper of desserts if there ever was one.",

I was informed they have both Asian and Italian restaurants and decided to go with the Asian one.I'll keep the review short and sweet-- I was so freakin glad I found this place! The Tofu Mango Rolls were OUT OF THIS WORLD! You have to try them if you are in the area. All of the dishes were light, refreshing, flavorful and tasty.I also found the service to be impeccable. The server recommended many items that I was hesitant to try at first but they ended up being delicious. The exotic fruit platter is also a must at the end of your meal!Great cuisine, ambiance, and character. This place is a true unexpected gem! Highly recommended!",

Worst chaos on earth never dine there. I have zero respect for this place, very disrespectful.",

As we went in for a table the hostess said nothing was avail. On my way our a door guy said he has a table but I'd have to spend a minimum of 200pounds lol okay. We sat the hostess came over and kept pressuring us at the table to pay the 200pounds upfront. Mind you this is a restaurant!!!!! Not a club!!!!i ended up paying it nonthless we only spend 165pounds and just decided to get two shots that got us to 200pounds. This is ridiculous they did not treat all the other walk in guest this way and by this way I mean they did not ask the other walk in guest to pay upfront or even a minimum. We were there for about 2hrs plenty of tables avail with the two hours we were there. Will never go back here ever. But the food was definitely good. Service terrible!!!!!",

    "text": "Novikov does incredible dim sum.I never thought I would utter these words, yet alone mean them so deeply.Novikov is owned by Arkady Novikov, one of Russia's most successful businessmen with a span of over 50 restaurants in Moscow before setting his sights on London. For those who don't know, Novikov isn't a new restaurant. It's the 540-seater super-restaurant that opened back in the summer of 2011. It's comprised of an Italian & Pan-Asian restaurant with a lounge bar downstairs.Novikov has some serious sex appeal.As soon as you walk through the doors it feels as if you have entered a secret members club.As we were here for Dim Sum we went to the Asian side; here it's dark, intimate and has THE most incredible display of fresh vegetables & seafood in front of the glassed open kitchen; which gives you the voyeurism without the distraction of noise from peeking at the kitchen in full action. You can request to choose your own dinner for the evening, and can ask for anything from the market to be cooked 'just how you like it.'We sat opposite the market area, so I can face plant against the glass wall and stare longingly at the freshest fish & shellfish; so fresh that I spied the langoustines trying to wriggle away to freedom whilst the lobsters antennae's nervously probed the air. HEAVEN!We went for the lunch Dim Sum menu, where you order in number of portions.You are given the choice of either 5 portions for \u00a325 or 8 portions for \u00a336 (4 dumplings per portion).Mmmhmmm I know what you're thinking, pretty shocked at the affordability of their lunch menu right?! Go quickly before they realise!!Their Dim Sum menu although small, is well-thought out and elevates what you thought you knew about Dim Sum unto a whole new level.We went for the:Spicy Prawn 'Moneybag'Chicken & morel siu maiKimchi wagyu dumplingsShrimp & Coriander dumplingsXiao Long BaoBlack Cod dumplingScallop OliveSteamed prawn, Froi Gras & truffle dumplingsTrust me when I tell you. I have never had Dim Sum quite like this.Every dumpling was a very generous size. Probably the biggest I have ever been presented with, with the name 'Moneybag' in the name you would expect some pretty hefty sized-dumpling balls to come out. And boy oh boy did they not disappoint.Sizeable, and beautiful. No skinny dumplins' here!Each mouthful, was as memorable as the next. The first bite of a Novikov dumpling is something that you will remember for the rest of the year.Taking my initial bite of the Spicy Prawn Moneybag dumpling, I was taken back at how fresh it was and by the fact that there was a full prawn in there.The dumpling casing was so soft yet kept it it's integrity until the first bite. Revealing a crunchy prawn and a very slight hint of spiciness.Now.... I could go and describe each dumpling to you, but they were all so awesome that I would have succumbed into ecstasy by the end of each mouthful, it would have probably turned into some other literature that you could all do with out. SO... I will just mention those that you SHOULD try.The Siu Mai: I will admit that normally, I am not a huge fan of siu mai. It always leave a weird after taste in my mouth that I don't like.But these Chicken & morel siu mai were sublime. The morel added a subtly mushroom flavour that was almost creamy. THE Xiao Long Bao: this is probably one of THE BEST xiao long baos that I have ever had. The huge medallion of meat that was encased the delicate dumpling skin was most definitely floating in a river in soup gushed out like a waterfall on the first bite. It was love at first bite.It was SO good, that I was eye-balling the final last dumpling so hard that FreshMikeEats gave mercy on me and let me have him. SUCCESS! He's mine... my own.... my precious ;DVerdict? Cancel your weekend plans next week right this second, and book yourself in for lunch at Novikov in their Asian room. Order the dim sum & die happy. You will wonder why you didn't have them on speed dial for dim sum lunch Sundays in the first place.yummei.com/2016/06/dim-s\u2026",

The display of fish and produce is beautiful!It's too noisy to hear what anyone bar the person beside you is saying , but the food is fantastic! Try the scallops with truffle, and all the classics .. the Peking duck is the best in London, they scrape the soft fat away and serve the crispy skin separately .. mouth watering! Service is excellent and quick! It would have 5 stars , but for the noise level!",

    "text": "I have always followed the motto of not judging a book by its cover, so I tried to walk into the double decker restaurant tabula rasa. I was met by stoney-faced Russians who clearly had a problem with me being unsure whose name the reservation was under. As I was meeting at least two people, I couldn't be sure, so I tried a few. This was met with a: \"You don't know who you are eating with?\" Unappreciated.Moving on...once we were seated (I think the hostess was surprised when my party materialized), the Italian room exudes opulence, albeit in a nouveau riche, Vegas-esque way. The open kitchen with buffet displays of food reminded me of the Carnival Cruise I went on when I was 17. The Italian theme was conveyed through walls with wrought iron grate accents, a ceiling of airy beams, and rustic wooden seating. The service was actually quite fast, no nonsense, and helpful. The food was good- my thin spirally pasta with rabbit ragout was filling and had the right ratio of cheap pasta to rich gamey sauce. They didn't skimp on quality, but for what they are charging, the quality should be fan-effing-tastic. The cheese and truffle pizza was thin, flavorful, and delicious.Apparently the restauranteer's 'Novikov' is the place to see and be seen which is apparent by the clientele, which is suited, glammed up, and ready to take in all that Novikov has to offer. More power to them.",

We asked the waitress to seat us and she was kind enough to do so, even though it was busy. The bartender didn't know what a Sidecar drink was but perhaps it's not a popular drink in England, so I opted for a Cosmo which was delicious and perfect for my mood :) The bartender offered us tequila shots too. I'm not sure who I would talk to or if I would enjoy the venue here by myself, but to come for drinks/to talk in a nice atmosphere with good friends it's perfect :)",

    "text": "I'm a world traveller and live in London for 6 years now. Never been treated like this before what it's unacceptable specially when you're paying a ridiculous price for just a table and having to wait 1h40 for food. After several attempts to ask for the food to at least 6 waiters/waitresses I've decided to speak to a manager who didn't really cared about my situation what makes him not very professional. After 1h40 the food arrived and I refused to eat it or pay for as I was leaving already. If at least the staff made me feel like the situation was going to be sorted. But no. 0. Can you imagine my disappointment when I've order first than many and seeing them all getting the food first even when they arrived after me!? Exactly... When I was finally leaving, asked to speak to the main manager who really didn't want to hear what I had to say because the bill was paid already anyway. He ignored me and called the security guys to put me out of the establishment using strength on me like I was a man or like I was drunk when that was not the case at all. Woke up feeling pain in my arms the next morning. Here it's the results of treating custumers badly and inappropriately! If from all the places in London people choose this restaurant and bar to go and pay to be there the minimum you should expect it's good food and an exquisite service! No? To finalise this review if this is how staff from a place with the rating like that treats their customers when they want to complain, specially if they're a woman and not drunk, then I certainly do not recommend it at all. If you want to feel lush and just drink that's an amazing atmosphere and music its good but to eat and specially the service? A big fat 0.It's pretty obvious that these reviews are fake or people been paid to say these compliments or they know nothing about service.",

The staff while not outwardly rude but more so snobbish. Which I guess compliments the crowd. Really sad I've listened to my friends who highly recommended it. Might have to rethink some friendships. The drinks were drinks. Can't say I was wowed but the presentation on my drink was pretty. Honestly don't think people come there for the food but to show off in albeit nice decor. That is all.

But the thing that really got to me is when it was time to pay the bill. The cashier comes over with her credit card machine standing over us as we are reviewing the bill. I tell her we are paying cash but she just stands there like she is watching over us trying to rush us out or thinks we are going to leave without paying. It got to a point where we had to ask her to come back in a few minutes. She walked away with attitude. It is beyond rude to stand over someone as they counting out cash to pay for their bill. Not sure what takes place here in London but I have never experienced such rudeness. Even though I enjoyed the food we definitely will not be going back and taking our business elsewhere.",

First of all a lady waiter asked for drinks and kept pushing a non-alcoholic cocktail for a 5 year old. Where as we were still deciding for the kid. Once drinks ordered never can during even half way dinner. Then other waiter who took the order forgot Prawn Tempura till the Maine course arrived and gave us wrong sushi rolls when hi we never ordered. Hence I called the manager and he was kind to take those item off the bill and send us a comped salad but I expected more than free food from the Resturant.

I heard they just opened in Miami. \u00a0Can't wait to try it!",

    "text": "Sushi has got to be one of my favourite foods, feed me good sushi and I'll be happy for life! Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly host- Katharina who showed us to our seats, embracing the Asian themed interior. I loved the openness of the kitchen, as it's reassuring to see everything made fresh before you. The open market where you can buy fresh vegetables and seafood is quite inviting and once again emphasises an Asian cultural experience.\u00a0I've eaten several times at Novikov and this time was no exception\u00a0before the waiter could ask any questions, I knew exactly what I wanted and how it would taste and I wasn't disappointed! Firstly we started with French Gillardeau no.2 oysters (4 Oysters) a natural aphrodisiac, which is full of protein, vitamins and, minerals, the taste was exquisite, surprisingly, as my preferred preference being Scottish Oysters.\u00a0Next was Sashimi, now I'm a sucker for Salmon and yellowtail, so I always order the same thing, but I decided to be bold and also order Scallops, which I regretted, not because of the taste, simply because I like what I like and that is Salmon Sashimi paired with Yellowtail Sashimi in Jalapeno peppers ;)For maki rolls, spicy tuna is always my choice, accompanied by lots of Wasabi and soy sauce. I like things spicy! Sometimes when eating a lot of sushi, my mouth tends to feel a bit cold and that's when Dim dum comes into play, Spicy Prawn dim sum was required just lift my tastes buds.And it is always better to finish with a salad, we ordered two duck salads, second mistake as the salad is quite filling and it is best to order one to share. Topped with leafy greensand pomegranates this salad is filled with zest but still remains a meaty taste. White wine was a great choice to pair with Sushi as anything else starts to turn my stomach. I thoroughly enjoyed my night and the atmosphere was nice, as we arrived at 7pm and watched as diners started to flood in, making Novikov full by 9pm.Overall the food was amazing and our host gave us the best customer service, however once in the lounge, the customer service is very poor with staff only serving you if you have a large table. We waited 45 minutes for a drink and it seems you have to be dressed inappropriately to get served!",

    "text": "Reviews of Novikov can be confusing because this one location features two full restaurants; one Italian, one pan-Asian, and a high-end lounge that attracts the rich and beautiful denizens of London. A place to see and be seen. And each one could easily be the subject of its own review. But because they share a name, an entrance, and are managed centrally they are usually rated as a whole. And this isn't really helpful, but as long as you understand this about Novikov, you'll be prepared.I discovered this place quite by chance. I was hungry and tired after an afternoon of walking between the main attractions in Mayfair when rain set in. We wanted a drink and a spot of lunch. I was wet and ready to sit when we turned the corner and this glamorous jewel caught our eye. I had been prepared for something more casual, but we were lured in as if compelled by a beautiful mirage. No sooner were we in the door than we were overwhelmed by the immediate and attentive service. Our hosts descended, took our coats, made a greeting and asked \"Asian or Italian?\" I didn't expect a choice and this threw me for a second, but the fresh Seafood bar had already caught my eye and anything from the Far East is go-to cuisine for me, so the the Italian option never stood a chance. And in we went.  The place truly is beautiful and welcoming with warm and inviting aesthetics and service that could easy seem suffocating, but somehow doesn't. Welcomes were exchanged, stories of their origin, drinks orders taken and the menu explained. We were were in good hands. But as I settled in I realized that this is their schtick. Norikov is an expensive, upscale, high touch, and focused on exceptional presentation and execution. Service that dotes, a menu that has something for all, and food that is well prepared with excellent flavors, great texture, and wonderful diversity. As a Seattle native I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to good seafood and Asian cuisine. And I was delighted. Their dishes are some of the best I've had anywhere in East Asia and Japan, and especially in Europe.We were given a tour as well of their Italian restaurant after our meal, and I have no doubt it's equally impressive, though the decor did feel much more staged. And this perhaps touches on the one thing that is unusual about Novikov. Which is the distinctively \"Russian oligarch\" sense of status and privilege this place exudes. It's hard to quantify but it's palpable. There's a sense that you either belong, or you don't, and the staff is here to reward those that do. The place is exclusive, and probably a bit unapproachable to some. And for those of us who don't observe or appreciate status, it can be off putting. But the dining and food experience were worth it, and so given the chance, I think you should check it out.",
