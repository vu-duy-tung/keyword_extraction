Good to fill up, but don't expect anything too fancy. I wouldn't venture outside of the English breakfast, jacket potato or omelette. Staff are nice and friendly, some dishes come with free tea and coffee, and they offer a loyalty card.",

We had breakfast here as a family and felt very welcome. It's more of a diner feel than a typical coffee type cafe, but it's definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. The prices are great and definitely of good value.Try the breakfast with the fried toast. So bad for you, bur so delicious!",

The set breakfast or the full breakfast should be able to satisfy most people's needs. However if you do have a big appetite or you have a incredible craving for the fry up, you can go for the Kennington special or the ultimate the builder's breakfast.

My husband and I wanted to eat a true English breakfast and at somewhere close to our hotel. We chose the right place! Halil took our order and gave us the option of half beans and half tin tomatoes for no extra charge, so that we could try everything. Because on the menu, it says served with the beans \"or\" tomatoes. Because I don't eat as much, I chose the Full Breakfast, and my husband chose the Kennington Special, which is the true full English breakfast. The portions were plentiful and at reasonable prices!Details of the food items.. The bacon is not like American style; it looks like ham, but it's not. It's more like a simple cured pork, but still very good. The sausage is similar to American breakfast sausage, but a little less spicy and thicker (bigger links). My husband says it's the best thing on the plate. It's definitely very good! I would describe the fried slice as like fried funnel cake batter as a toast. The beans are similar to American baked beans, but not as sweet and with no barbecue flavor- a surprisingly pleasant accompaniment. Tin tomatoes are basically warmed-up canned, stewed tomatoes. I don't usually like tomatoes, especially big chunks or pieces of them, but I liked these. They complemented the bacon very well. The regular slice is basically regular, buttered toast. Black pudding is blood sausage. The taste was a mild sausage-like flavor with no blood taste at all. It paired well (and was actually recommended by Halil) with the bubble, which was basically a veggie hash. The mushrooms were saut\u00e9ed, sliced and diced mushrooms.The service was quick and everything tasted great! Kennington Lane Caf\u00e9 is a brunch place, but also serves regular lunch. My husband and I checked out the rest of their menu and everything else on it sounded awesome too. They have a great variety of choices and we really thought about going back for late lunch. Their upstairs seating reminded us of American diner style and they have downstairs seating too. Whatever you all choose to go eat, you won't be disappointed!",

Our waiter, and I presume the owner, was Halil and he was nothing short of spectacular. He was charming, engaging and funny and more importantly made sure your food order was proper and to your liking. And speaking of the food, it was equally incredible. And although it was a small cafe it had several options to choose from, from a traditional English to a vegetarian one. I personally had the Builder's Breakfast and I didn't leave with any space left. With lunch and dinner options as well, you can't miss at any time of day. So, for a low key, well done food experience away from the hustle of busy downtown London, you needn't look any further than here.",

My friends were judging the cafe based on the outside and were a little apprehensive but I knew we had to go! To clarify, there's nothing wrong with the outside it's just small little unassuming cafe. We walked by the cafe every morning (it was near our place) and you can tell the locals frequent this cafe, so you know it's good! They have different breakfast combinations. My friends were more conservative than me and got the \"Full Breakfast\" I was being extra so I got the \"Builders Breakfast\" which is pretty much their biggest breakfast. Our meals came with a coffee (which honestly tasted like a latte-- not complaining) which is a nice touch. Everything was quick and delicious.Not only was the food delicious, service was wonderful as well. They make you feel at home and welcomed. One of the men who worked there even gave us an umbrella because he saw us standing under the awning while it was raining after our breakfast. He asked how we heard of the restaurant and I said Yelp, and he responded with \"Of course, you Americans!!\" Enjoyed my meal and experience here a lot!!",

I tried a piece of black pudding (blood sausage) from my cousin's and it definitely tastes better than it sounds!! Should try it if you have not tried it!
