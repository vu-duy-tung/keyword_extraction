Not sure if they were real monkeys or not but the entertainment value was second to none. it didnt take too long before the waiter with 3 arms came to take our order. At first my girlfriend was a little shocked by the extra arm, but soon came round to it as it made having all our dim sum arrive in only one trip. That was pretty impressive as we ordered about 50 dishes.. one for every year of my life.The food really came to life. Quite literally! The prawn stood up and started to do what looked like a belly dance, before doing a triple back flip into my mouth. Now how the chefs trained them to do that is beyond meI would definitely recommended the lotus to anyone who is after a great meal. This was a truly great experience and one which i will never forget.",

I have only ever been here on a weekend for lunch and as i normally find of Canary Wharf and surroundings to be completly dead, this place always seems to be heaving. The restaurant is split over 2 floors, i think the upper floor is slightly more 'plain' compared to downstairs. The boat is pretty stationary for those without sea legs! I have only tried the Dim Sum menu (with a couple of dishes of the main menu) and must admit i am pleasantly pleased with what we have had. The usual dim sum are on offer, and are all very tasty, especially my favourite Char sui buns. The staff can be over attentive - we were asked for drinks by 3 different staff members in the first 5 minutes, although when the food arrived we still had no bowls, and of course there were no staff around, however they are friendly and quick on the mark. I have been with groups each time, and never had to spend more than a tenner each, which is fantastic value for money. Worth the trip to Canary Wharf.",

It is quite an extraordinary feature for a Chinese restaurant.This place serves great value and delicious dim sum. The price is about 15% cheaper than most Chinese restaurant. I am a keen supporter of this restaurant and I usually have dim sum here on Saturday afternoon. There are 2 storeys of huge dining spaces; hence getting a table is not a problem. Booking in advance is not necessary. My favourite dim sum here is the black sesame dumplings and the Char Siu pastry, they are the best that I have tried in London.Dinner in this restaurant is not as good as the dim sum. So my recommendation for first timer is to try the dim sum.",

    "text": "The 'Lotus' is as other people have said here a static floating boat in one of the docks near Canary Wharf. It is easy to reach via DLR or a short walk from Canary Wharf Jubilee line and there is also some parking around the boat which is pretty cheap, (If you can't park nearby there is an ASDA carpark 4mins walk away where if you spend on your weekly shopping you can park here). On first impression the restaurant is quite imposing with two floors for dining and good views (from one side of the boat) over the dock. It's usually pretty busy but as previous reviewers have said there isn't usually a wait and thus pre-booking is not essential. Lotus serves as expected both Dim-Sum and also evening meals. I have been there for both and will comment on both. Dim sum: The Dim Sum menu is a reasonable length with the standard dishes on it. On this front the dishes are reasonable, quite tasty and usually quick to arrive. There is also a special menu which is in Chinese only (at least it is when they give it to me!). From the special menu there are lots of goodies such as Chive 'cakes'. Service tends to be quite fast, although for some reason they often 'lose' a dish somewhere along the line meaning you either get one after you've finished everything else, or cancel it. The Dim Sum gets 4/5 stars, it's not as good as Peninsula which is nearby, (see other review). I've been to both many times an enjoy both. Evening food: The evening menu is large and I like the food from it. It's a bit greasy however and some dishes are over-priced. However they do great Tofu, (beancurd) dishes including some really spicy numbers that rival Bar Shu. Portion sizes are pretty large for some dishes so you won't feel hungry at the end. Also, and this makes it heaven for some of my Chinese friends Free rice refills and free Red Bean dessert at the end of the meal :) 3.5/4 stars due to comparisons with other Chinese restaurants around. Overall then, it's a good place. Not totally authentic but decent.",

Having called ahead and been told that there was no need to book we turned up and sure enough the main dining deck was half-empty. It was thus a little surprising when we had to flag down a waiter after twenty minutes for our order to be taken but nonetheless we ordered starters and mains. Our starters turned up piecemeal and we noticed that the waiter made no effort to serve the right dish to the right person. When our starters were cleared a different waitress came back with menus and asked if we were ready to order our main courses. We pointed out that we'd done that half an hour earlier. Eventually our original waiter appeared and found his note of our order. He told us that there was a large party upstairs and that service was very slow that evening; it was painfully obvious that our main order was not only late but had in fact been lost. After some considerable discussion (during which our repeated requests to speak to the manager were fobbed off) we eventually got a free bottle of wine and our main courses finally arrived. The food was very good but by this point we just wanted to eat, pay and leave. At no point did any of the staff we dealt with show any sign of genuine concern, nor did they apologise for not informing us that service would be slow despite having told us that the restaurant was not busy (when in fact it was). I would not recommend the Lotus. If someone did want to try it I would suggest asking on arrival for a clear statement as to how busy they are and how long it is likely to take to get served.",

Quite authentic. I once wanted to leave feedback (positive) about our waiter. I hence asked to speak to the manager. This was received with honest shock=was asked if there was anything wrong and what she could do to make it better. Even when I said it was \"positive\" feedback, she still seemed concerned.

As for the food, very good value as always and the price is extremely reasonable - maybe not as cheap as you would get it in Hong Kong or China, but very good for London standards. The menu is not bad either, decent selection with the odd mix of specials being introduced - for the specials, you really need to speak to one of th waitress' to get a good idea. I personally much prefer the lunch options over the dinner options - the Dim Sum is much closer to authentic Chinese food than the dinner menu - which is rather unfortunate as I had expected more on that front. One final note for those who generally split the bill - they have a minimum for the amount for card transactions, so beware.",

The atmosphere is probably best for someone who wants to have quiet discussion and enjoy their food.

Where, outside of Vegas, would you find a floating dim sum place?When we were first moved from Canary Wharf to Millwall, it was bereft of any shops and cafes, but of course, there was the floating monstrosity. The Lotus sits on a barge, surrounded by river debris and on the outside are big plastic bins that the trash goes in. It smells. You see workers dumping the trash. It's gross. It should not be. But I'd heard that some co-workers had eaten here. And more importantly, survived. I always refused. On principal. But one day we all decided to go for dim sum. And it wasn't bad. We ordered up a round of the usual steamed and fried dishes. All very tasty and not suspect in the least. A co-worker and I even tried the curried whelks (well, once you've looked the devil in the eyes, it seems pointless not to go the whole hog, or whelk). These weren't so great. The dim sum here is good, but don't get me wrong, it's a strange and disturbing place.",

Tables are spaciously laid out, not like many other Chinese restaurants where they try to cram as many tables in as possible. They serve dimsum and also have a proper menu. I've only ever had the dimsum, and it was good, comparable to what you can get in restaurants in Chinatown. I've also tried the seafood ho fun noodles, which was massive (enough for 2 people). Bill wise expect to pay around \u00a38-\u00a313 per person (excluding drinks) for a filling dimsum",

We totally stuffed ourselves and the bill came to slightly more than \u00a312pp including service which is less than you'd pay at a Royal China or similar.I found the food slightly too oily for my liking, but they definitely made up for it with variety. There was a good range of steamed and fried dim sums as well as quite a few cheung funs (noodles wrapped around a filling, I recommend bbq pork or fried dough). I was definitely impressed with their variety and reckon they have more options than most. They also had congee and a few other items on a little card with only chinese (which the girl was kind enough to read out to me since I can't read chinese!) - so worth asking if you feel like something in particular and you can't find it on the standard yum cha menu.They also have the no seating until your whole party is there policy, which I find an annoying practice, as I'm used to eating and waiting when it comes to yum cha! (Saying that they are not the only chinese restaurant to implement this policy).All in all, if you're in the area and don't mind the cheesy setup that is a floating chinese restaurant, it is definitely worth a visit for a spot of yum cha.",

    "text": "this is probably the only restaurant where I can count myself as a regular. So what do I eat here? Two words: DIM SUM. (if you don't know what this is, it's like the Chinese version of tapas but we only have this for brunch)Brought my sis here who has been living a couple of months in Shanghai and she felt that the dimsum in Lotus is way better than what she had over there. (granted, dimsum is from HK, but if Shanghai can't compare to Lotus ... well, that proves how awesome Lotus is, doesn't it?)Plus, the price is reasonable here. For a good dimsum brunch, the total bill comes up to approx. \u00a310 per person. Compared to Hakkasan, it's definitely a hit! However, the dinner options here are not up to par, I feel that only the dimsum is what makes lotus so popular in the afternoons. Love the fried custard buns especially. (would recommend more but I only know their Cantonese names)Every time someone from central London (or elsewhere) comes to visit me, I always, always bring them here for dim sum. Always. Then, when word spreads, more friends start asking and that hole in my purse starts getting bigger. Anyway, like a friend said, \"in life you lose some, you dim sum.\"",

This place is also not bad at all for dinner, but you have to know what to order. Lamb hotpot with bean curd sheets was excellent, as was the steamed fish. I can also wholeheartedly recommend the scrambled egg seafood hor fun. A great lunch or dinner one-dish meal, or as one of several dishes.",

If you are not from Canary Wharf, there is very little chance of you ever being able to locate the place (but to be fair to them, there is no reason for an outsider to travel here to have chinese food). The food here is pretty good, especially the dumplings, but nothing outstanding, and overly expensive for the quality and the location. Also they do not accept credit cards for bills less than \u00a315. That is not cool.But i will forever remain grateful to them for the hot chicken soup they fed me (for cash, no card) the day London was snowed in. Helped me to get through that day ... brrrrr ...",

The scenery is just breathtaking there and there are a lot of windows, so you can admire it from each and every table. Additionally the decoration is very well-picked, it is not overdone and doesn't outshine the simple beauty of the nature outside. I haven't tried a lot of the dishes on the menu, mainly the dim sum menu and a couple of the main dishes, but all of them tasted delicious and seasoned right, not too bland, but not too spicy either. I would recommend trying the vegetable spring rolls and the scallop dumpling for your first visit there, as they both taste delicious and you won't make a mistake ordering them. As for the service- all the staff are very friendly and efficient, even a little too attentive sometimes. They tend to not keep track of who is serving a certain table, but never the less that's not a problem, you might just have to remind them that you have already placed your order. Otherwise they are always there when you need them, so you won't really have to wait for your food or get a cold one, and the same goes for the bill.",

We were quite disappointed the last time we were there. Yesterday, we thought let's try something new. My partner found this place and he assumed I would love it. I was quite a travel from my place. It was in Canary Wharf. I was anxious and grumpy as I was starving! It was 1pm when we arrived. I loved it! Lotus it was called. Lotus the Floating Chinese Restaurant. It was packed. There was a handful people waiting to be seated. We were greeted by beautiful lady dressed in Chinese Costume presenting pamplets for Shen Yun . 'Table for 2' I requested to the attending staff. 'No No, No please come after 2' he replied abruptly. How rude I thought. I asked if they take reservations. 'NO reservation, Come after 2' I was actually quite annoyed with is abruptness. But I wanted to have lunch there, it was crowded and filled Chinese originates. This could only mean one thing. GOOD FOOD! I am happy to overlook the rudeness, just to taste the food and judge for myself.We went to the nearest pub for drink while we waited. We got back to the restaurant quarter to. It was still packed and at least half a dozen on customers were still waiting to be seated. He recognised us and said 'Ahhh you came back.Wait i find you table'. Couple of minutes later he come back and offered a table for two facing the river. Lovely view. I loved it. And all his rudeness before just seemed to have disappeared.The menu, they server both Dim Sum and ala carte dishes. The wine menu look pretty good for a midrange Chinese restaurant. Couple of dishes caught my eye. Fried Ying Yong! I have not had that for ages. Rice with salted fish and sliced pork. I love this dish. We ordered a few classic dumplings , siew mai, char siu bau, crispy yam courgrates, cheong fun deep fried battered squids, rice with salted fish and sliced pork, stir fried pack choi garlic style and egg tarts; accompanied by jasmine tea. Everything was scrumptious. This has been one of the best dim sum I ever had. Bear in mind I am from Malaysia and we do have very good Dim Sums. We are definitely coming back here, and the next time we are going for the full blown meal. Meat, vege and rice!I highly recommend this place. Try it at least once. You will not regret it. Perfect for Sunday lunches with family thehungrybea.com/2012/01\u2026 TheHungryBea.com",

So if not for the food, visit here for the views. Portion wise, is quite similar to other nearby Chinese restaurants so could do with a little bit more on the plates and the food when compared to my experience in other restaurants is probably a tad bit better in quality. What sets them apart from other restaurants is the service (no offence but Chinese restaurants aren't known for their customer service skills so it was nice to be treated like you're welcomed!) My favourite would be their version of the standard 'poached chicken with ginger scallion oil' but done with a coating of chilli with the chicken sat on a bed of jelly (not your typical jelly per se but still very good).",

Upon closer look, I laughed and told my bf it's a decked out floating chinese restaurant called Lotus - wtf? I got home and looked to see if the place was any good, and surprisingly it has quite large following on Yelp. Could it be that there's a dimsum place in walking distance to our place and is actually good while floating on water? Finally I found the opportunity to drag my bf back there and have dimsum. And I overordered:- lotus leaf wrapped chicken sticky rice (good!)- turnip cake (great!)- fried dough rice rolls (good!)- curry squid (ew)- bbq pork buns (meh)- custard buns (great!)- black bean pork ribs (good but fatty)- prawn and chive dumplings x 2 (great!)- black bean chicken feet and pork ribs on rice (ok)The total was 43.23 GBP, including 1.50 tea charges for two ppl.The price was reasonable, and we had to take a lot of food home given how much i ordered. The service was great and the view is amazing as you are sitting in a boat. It's definitely going to be our new go-to place for dimsum from now on!",

I read that some people felt that the food was not well seasoned, but hey! That sort of worked for me? I thought it was well balanced, so did my friends. The congee was okay too but slightly too salty for my liking, otherwise the portion of century egg given was generous and the meat given was slightly paltry. I mean it's \u00a34.80 per bowl, I think the portion justified the price. Apart from the congee, I had nothing else to complain. Oh wait, maybe ask for their chilli (not the freshly chopped ones, get the chilli with oil) if you can stomach heat. The chilli is really good!",

They don't take reservations so we came at 12 PM, right when they opened, and were allocated a large table upstairs for our group of 13 people. If you are not able to grab a table when they first open, it's a long wait! Service was chaotic because of the large influx of people at the same time, and it took a long time for us to get our food. They tended to bring out a dish or two at a time, and they also brought food first to the Cantonese speaker in our group and it took much longer for the rest of us to get our orders. Dim sum turned into over a 2 hour affair. But the food is incredibly well priced, authentic, and delicious, and I would hope that normally things are a little more efficient. The final bill was only \u00a312 each! I was shocked by what good value it was and would definitely come again. It's worth the trek out to Zone 2 and not far from Crossharbour station on the DLR.",

Although the boat normally does not leave the shore embarking on the boat itself creates a different feeling than just popping into a usual dining place.I visited The Floating Lotus Twice. On first occasion it was a company dinner and I liked the idea of a round table as everyone was able to have a conversation with each other. The food was tasty and reasonably priced.On the second occasion it was the Chinese New Year. The decor was much more lively and the restaurant was busier than normal for obvious reasons. The aromatic crispy duck was indeed aromatic and crispy and the squid starter with red chilly and spring onions did the trick as the combination of tastes created more appetite.Despite not so enthusiastic waiting staff and an included 10% service charge the meal was more than satisfying to the palate.All in all I'd visit again.",

    "text": "This is a solid choice for a dim sum (yum char) lunch. We usually have a craving every week or so and we walk away from here satisfied after a filling lunch. It's good value too.It has all of the usual dim sum favourites and items you can order off the menu. I like their sticky rice in lotus leaf wrap and they do good prawn dumplings too. The Shanghai pork dumplings need improvement.I recommend it as a family friendly restaurant where you can bring young children and be easily accommodated.The restaurant is uniquely in a boat moored to the side of Millwall Inner Dock, near Canary Wharf. The closest DLR stop is Crossharbour, but South Quay is also a short walk away.",

A friend of mine from HK and his family first took me here for yum cha one sunday and it's been a regular of mine ever since.In terms of authenticity, taste and notably value for money it's easily top 5 in London (along with Yi Ban docklands and JKL Chinatown).Standard yum cha fare - har gau, siu mai, lo mai gai, hot pots, char siu bau and alike all for around 2-3 quid. There can be a bit of a queue sunday afternoons, and the waitering staff arent the most attentive (though again from my experience of restaurants in HK, that's pretty authentic also!).",

So unique with its style, very traditional decorations but yet very innovative for the idea of a floating restaurant!Not to mention the food..simply amazing! Their noodles are really the best I've ever tried, not overcooked or over salted.. just perfect! Will definitely come back very soon",

For main I had the crispy shredded beef which is really really great. You can tell it's all very fresh and you don't feel gross and greasy afterwards, which is a plus! Egg fried rice is also nice.",
