I was here tonight, upstairs was full so directed down to a store room that is also used as a second dining room. \u00a0Service was very slow and my friend was charged a pound for a glass of tap water. \u00a0Food-wise the spicy green beans were great, the rice was so-so but I really didn't like either the stir fried chicken in dry bowl, or the rabbit. \u00a0Both of these dishes seem to have been made by throwing an animal carcass in a wood chipper, and then boiling in chilli and deep frying respectively. I hate eating dishes with sauces that have meat on the bone, life is just too short to go digging about for the occcasional morsel of chicken that lies between skin and bone fragments. \u00a0The rabbit was similarly awkward. \u00a0I noticed the lamb skewers and wished I had ordered them, but could not be bothered to wait. \u00a0My friend doesn't have the same issue with meat on the bone and he enjoyed it, personally I felt it was awful waste of time and money for the reasons described, but that could be me rather than the food. \u00a0I expect I'll come here again but I'll order something entirely different.",

    "text": "Summary: 'My Old Place', well it's true this place has been around a long time. It used to be a Thai restaurant before this current Chinese theme/menu was adopted. I've been twice and each time the food has been authentic and well prepared. It's a Northern China restaurant, of which there aren't that many in London anyway, so it's refreshing and worth a visit. Northern Food is often spicy and simple. Vegetables and fresh ingrediants are key and there's a particular like for strongly flavoured items (sauce or actual meats). Great for the taste buds. Review: Food: 4/5 - Good food, although the Chinese menu is better than the English menu. Take a native with you for the best dishes. I liked a lot of the fish dishes as well as things with aubergine in them. They also do traditional Chinese deserts, eg, sweet potato. Service: 2/5 - Poor, little English comprehension and slow service. They don't forget dishes, but they will forget ad-hoc requests or dishes. It seems to be focused on English speakers though, so I guess if you're Chinese not so much a problem. Also lower score due to attitude, some of the serving staff are a bit sullen. Price: 4/5 - Very good, we went as a group of 15 last time and a massive meal worked out at \u00a313 a head with drinks. Location: Easy to reach via Liverpool street. Conclusion: Good, solid entry to the Chinese food list in the UK.",

    "text": "This is the second branch of My Old Place, with the original branch in Bethnal Green attracting queues, and it's rather good. Szechuan spiced food is the order of the day, with a good range of spicy dishes as well as some excellent barbeque and soup. They do a cheaper lunch menu, with rice and soup, or the full menu, with huge portions and high quality. The service is a little random on occasion, but the staff are normally friendly if a little distracted or confused. If you ask nicely they will do takeaway, although you may end up with a small pile of takeaway containers to be able to carry the rather silly sized portions. I recommend the double cooked pork as well as the fish fried pork, which is my regular. Take care with how spicy the dishes are, as they vary from visit to visit and can sometimes be significantly more fearsome than you would expect.",

Is this even allowed?I was willing to tolerate the long waits in the queue, lack of manners, very poor English, slow service, cash-only-payment, receipts that are simply a piece of paper from a notepad with scribblings in Chinese and the provokingly indifferent attitude towards anyone non-East-Asian but this takes the biscuit!! And the most frustrating thing of all is that you can't even complain about any of the above, because no-one will understand you!It's a shame because the food is indeed very good - the lamb skewers are to die for, the prices are reasonable (possibly even more reasonable on the Chinese menu, I bet :P) and I live really close. But I won't be going back... I gave it a few chances, just in case my bad experience was a one-off, but...no.There are plenty of nice places to eat in the area, and if it wasn't for the Chinese-fanbase queuing up outside every day, I bet the place would be empty. Four stars for the food, no stars for the service, so that makes it two from me.",

Take it from someone who knows, this restaurant cooks up food that is the closest to Chinese home cooking as most would ever get.Here, the Szechuan chicken is really spicy as it is cooked with loads of dried red chillies and peanuts just like it is supposed to be. Not chicken in sweet orange gloop as it usually comes as in other places. It is delicious here. The barbecued meat dressed in Xinjiang herbs and cooked on hot coals brought back memories of my travels to Kashgar. Seriously, it's the same. I know I'm banging on about the authenticity, but it's so hard to find proper tasting Chinese food. The food is really really good and the portions they serve are huge. It is best to go in a large group because then you can try loads and still have boxes of leftovers to take home with you. \u00a0The service, I don't recall being spectacular but then maybe I was too busy scoffing my face or reminiscing about my trips to China. Who knows. All I know is, the food was so good, I didn't care about the service and that usually never happens.",

    "text": "Better known as Lao Di Fang among the Chinese, this is an authentic Northern Chinese place which serves amazing Szechuan & Xinjiang dishes. It's a regular joint for me and a few of my Chinese friends and, perhaps, because I have always been there with native Chinese friends, I have not had to face indifferent service mentioned in some of the other reviews. That said, service is functional and efficient at best and doesn't attempt to be overly warm. Once you go there, however, it doesn't take long to realise that service and ambience be damned, the food is gooood. Spicy, flavourful, doled out in massive portions and most inexpensive - could it get any better?Highly recommend the chicken and lamb BBQ skewers at a quid each. I would encourage people to be a tad experimental and try out the cold meats - not something typically associated with Asian cuisine - the 'husband & wife' (a white meat & red meat dish) preparation is succulent and satisfying. Very rarely does a vegetarian dish excite me as much as the potato-peppers-aubergine dish that seems to be a staple on every table. The vermicelli & meat dish is another recent discovery I liked. The fish soup in a ginormous bowl comes with a fishing net, amusingly enough. The double-cooked spicy pork belly is yum, to say the least. As an accompaniment to these spicy dishes, I would recommend a beer or the aloe vera drink. This place has only one dessert - caramelized fried potatoes, a unique and delightful preparation, even if a tad on the heavy side after a big meal.Honestly, I struggle to think of any preparation here that I did not like! That said, there are several items on the menu I am yet to try out - I see myself going back there several times for a long time to come.After stuffing yourself silly with such good food, what could be a better sight than a bill that amounts to just about 10quid/head for food? Ah, bliss!Carry some cash along with you when you go, this place doesn't take cards, or at least, prefers not to. This is a good place to go to in groups of 4-8, I can imagine 2-3 people struggling to get through a moderate selection of main dishes! As an added bonus, being a fan of this place will automatically make you very popular among your Chinese friends :D",

The decor is very minimal, having a feel of a cheap Chinese canteen rather than a proper restaurant. The staff do speak English, but one gets the feeling that the usual customers are Chinese-speaking. The majority of the diners when I was there were of Chinese origin, a testimonial to the authenticity of the food. Furthermore, one of the menus is fully in Chinese, and although I think all the dishes on it are on the English menu too, it might be best if someone in your group knows Chinese or at least knows what the dishes are. Its a perfect place to try ma la dishes, which is a numbing sort of spicyness only found in Szechuan food. Prices are very reasonable with massive main dishes costing \u00a37-10. The 4 of us hungry young adults who went there managed to spend only \u00a340 in total (excluding drinks), and there was so much food we couldn't finish it all. The food is probably not to everyone's taste and has not been Westernized, but for those seeking an authentic Chinese, or more specifically Szechuan experience, this is the place to go!",

Since i was craving Chinese food, i looked this one up on yelp and headed for it. A restaurant in the spitalfields area open till 11 pm on a Sunday ... this might prove to be useful, i thought. But alas, when i reached there (at about two minutes after 10), i was turned away. There were customers still eating inside but i was told for some reason they were closing early that day. I really hate it when businesses waste their food rather than serve a willing to pay customer two minutes after the scheduled close.But as luck would have it, my scheduled dinner was disrupted the next evening and i returned here again. Thankfully, they let me in this time. The dining hall was full ... with patrons quietly eating and whispering to each other ... like any other restaurant in the City. Since the ground floor was full, i was directed to go to the dining area in the basement. This was entirely different. It seemed to me that i had suddenly been transported from London to a fish market in Asia. People were eating and drinking and talking loudly ... there were bottles of Tsing Tao all over and the decibel level was high enough to warrant the attention of the anti-pollution authorities. But many of the patrons in this part of the restaurant were Asian ... and they seemed to be enjoying their food. A good sign, i remember thinking then.I ordered one chicken sweet corn soup, a special fried rice and a plate of chicken (which was rather forgettable, i can't even remember the name) along with coke. They got me the soup pretty early, and it was quite nice. I was hungry and cold and so i finished it in no time. Then i waited. I waited as i saw people being served food all around me, the people eating their food, drinking their beer, breaking their beer bottles, the wreckage being cleaned up, people paying and then leaving ... all while i waited. After what seemed like an eternity, i got the fried rice and the coke. I waited again, sipping on my drink, as the rice turned cold. The couple of spoonfuls of rice i had initially actually seemed decent, but it didn't remain so by the time i got the chicken. By then i was in a hurry to leave, and so i gulped down my food, went up to the counter myself to pay (in cash, they don't accept credit cards at least in the basement) and left ... without any intention of ever returning again.",

    "text": "I went expecting a bit of a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am chilli punch to the head, but chose the wrong dishes. Eating the well-cooked and tasty, but ultimately frustratingly tame tasting tender beef, i got a major case of dish envy as chilli laden plates went wafting by in an eye (and mouth) watering waft of spicy aromas. The lamb skewers were good, although our second two were much better in terms of spicing than the first couple - although like @raistlyn below, my companion said they were much better at Gourmet San. never the less, these were a treat, particularly for those of us unused to the Xinjiang cuisine of China's western regions. The Chef's Special Curried Crab happily tempered a bad case of the green-eyed-monster and pulled my attention back to the food in front of me. Strongly flavoured in a tongue-tingling way without overwhelming the flavour of the crab, this was a great dish. The moral of the story? Be brave and dive straight into the chilli laden dishes with the higher spice ratings because they're the ones that will blow your socks off. And go in a group, because as noted below, the dishes are huge and two mains and a 'side' of veg is enough to fill two hungry bellies.",

They unfortunately haven't been doing the lamb skewers for months now and due to the poor customer service, it has been difficult to get a reason or timeframe of when they'll be back. I now instead order from what appears to be their sister restaurant, Gormet San, as they do delivery. If you're craving good northern chinese authentic food, definitely come here. It's great for after work if you're around Liverpool Street with a group of friends that want some Chinese grub. Some usual dishes I order are the dry fried sweet and sour pork, braised fish fillets and \u00a0aubergine with potatoes. If you can look past the service, it's a pretty good place! I've put three stars instead of four because of the lack of service. I'm comparing it to Gormet San which has the same food, price but service is by far better.",

It's full of Chinese diners in the city during a weekday so it shows it's authenticity. Don't expect good service because they are known for poor service and make you wait to order/pay but the food comes out quite quick. For some strange reason why seem to also do weddings downstairs occasionally but still open the restaurant for the general public. If that happens you're a bit unlucky and the staff are not afraid to say that 'you need to wait' because of how busy they are! Bit of a odd place but I imagine it to be like that in the busy streets of China. The three types of vegetable dish is also one of my favourite with juicy aubergines bursting in your mouth but it's super hot so be warned.",

They do a good job of those dishes that you normally wouldn't find in other restaurants in London, like Northeastern clear noodle, stewed Potato, Green Pepper and Aubergine, and spring chicken and mushroom. They also have fresh noodles and dumplings made onsite, which are well known in Northeastern food. BBQ is not from the Northeast region, but it is very popular in Northwestern part of China and can be found in almost all night markets. BBQ lamb skewers here are great.Of course, you can find some typical hot and spicy Sichuan dishes here as well. I especially like Ma Po Tufu and Poached Sliced Beef in Hot Chili Oil. The restaurant is not somewhere you want to linger and the services are not the best. However, if you are in the mood for some good Chinese food, give it a try.",

    "text": "One of my earliest childhood foodie memories when I lived in Wuhan, China - \u00a0was eating scalding hot spicy lamb skewers - when my mom and I were walking around eating street food for breakfast or as a snack. \u00a0I would come to My Old Place just for the lamb skewers alone because they taste exactly like I remember them from when I was young. \u00a0This is very authentic.The rest of the food is also delicious. We got pickled cabbage and pork soup, baby bok-choy stirfried with garlic sauce and fish fragrant pork (Yu-shang pork). Lets break it down one by one:1) pickled cabbage with pork soup - broth is very flavorful, but not as tangy as one would expect from pickled cabbage. \u00a0The soup is boiling hot (AWESOME!), the cabbage crunchy, and the pork relatively tender. The only negative is that the pork slices were sometimes skin, sometimes fat, and sometimes meat. \u00a0I happen to like that, but it might be a bit odd for someone not expecting it. 2) baby bok-choy with garlic sauce - this is pretty standard fare, but the sauce was very velvety, coated the veggies well, and the amount of garlic was just right. 3) \u00a0fish fragrant pork - excellent if eaten hot. \u00a0The sauce was just the right amount of savory, sweet, tangy, and spicy. \u00a0They are generous with the pork as well. \u00a0If you let it get cold, though, the sauce congeals really fast - so eat quickly! \u00a0The sizes of the portions are quite large, each dish is easily shared between two people. \u00a0My dining partner and I thought that we would have leftovers - but as we found out - two hungry Chinese people can demolish 6 lamb skewers (we ordered 2 more after we ate everything else), 1 huge plate of Bok-choy, and a gigantic platter of fish fragrant pork. \u00a0I definitely recommend going here, though expect that the service is a bit slow at times and that the food comes out when they are done - not at specific times. \u00a0You may get your main before the skewers and sometimes you may be done with your one of your mains before the other one comes out. \u00a0As long as you keep this in mind - I'm sure you would enjoy the food!",

Located on Middlesex street, really close to the Liverpool underground station, this place looked incredible with its design. As soon as you walk in, you find this Chinese inspired decorations, from big vases to beautiful chandeliers, this place felt great.The staff, while being respectful and friendly, weren't that talkative. I expected a courteous treatment from smiling to asking if we needed any help, but that's a minor thing to complain about. We ordered rice, plain noodles, spicy beef and chicken that came in a bowl over a small fire. I love spicy food and so the spicy beef was a good treat. It was, however, a bit too oily for my taste, but other than that it was a delight. The plain noodles were... Well, plain, but that's exactly what I wanted. My friend had the rice, so I wouldn't know how it tasted. As for the chicken, it wasn't bone and skin-free which was a bit surprising for me. My friend had explained to me that there is the bone and skin free variety which we could have ordered.Now to the prices. The prices were high on the average end. Meaning, most dishes cost around 8 pounds and you'd have to order everything separately. Like the beef costs 8 or 10 and noodles cost 4. So expect to pay something from 10-20 pounds per person. I did notice they had set meals which could be a better options for those watching their wallet's diet.All in all, I found the place nice and it's definitely worth a visit if you haven't tried it before. I think I will try it again in the near future!",

    "text": "A Singaporean friend brought me to this restaurant when we got hungry after a few drinks in the City. I don't eat Chinese food often in London, but when I do, it is usually with Asians that know where to go. I would not have expected My Old Place to be so authentic given where it is, halfway between Liverpool Street and Aldgate East, but it's done well and attracts a mix of both City workers and Asian diners coming for the very impressive menu. My friend didn't give me much choice in ordering - he immediately went for the pork and cabbage dumplings, green beans with minced pork and garlic, and two skewers of lamb. We later added a plate of fried chives, tofu, cuttlefish, and prawn. \u00a0The cuisine is meant to be Szechuan, but only the green beans came with chili in them, and it was pretty mild. Those were delicious, and the portion was quite large, but to be honest there wasn't much minced pork in them. We also got a good 15 or so dumplings that had been steamed, and interestingly enough, they were served with dark vinegar rather than your typical soy sauce. I thought that the lamb skewers ok but nothing that impressive, given that it was just a few bites' worth. I really enjoyed the chives and seafood dish, mostly because it was all of my favourite things. The dish itself is light in flavour, and once again the portion size was more than generous. In hindsight, for two people, it probably would have been fine to order 2 dishes and some rice, but there are so many interesting dishes on the menu, so it is incredibly hard to hold back. All in all, it was a great find and I'd definitely recommend it for authentic, unpretentious Chinese food in central London.",

    "text": "Came here cos I heard from my friends (who coincidentally came with me that night) about how popular the place is among the crowd at Liverpool St. However, after a dinner here - I dont think I'm coming back any time soon. I initially thought that their specialty here is Szechuan cuisine, but now I know otherwise after reading the reviews below. Don't think I'm a fan of Northern Chinese cuisine after all!First off, the kou shui ji (cold chicken in szechuan chilli sauce/saliva chicken) was doused in peanut sauce and not chilli oil - absolutely weird. Next, their shui zhu yu (water-cooked fish) has probably an entire kilogram bag of peppercorn in it, as well as bean sprouts. It was disgustingly oily (even if water-cooked fish is supposed to be oily) and I really didn't like biting into the peppercorn which emitted a strong minty taste in my mouth. The lamb skewers (supposedly one of the sought-after food items here) was only so-so, and nothing to rave about. The other dishes we ordered whose names I cannot recall were absolutely dubious looking and unappetising. Fair enough, some dishes such as the long-beans were quite delicious, as well as the Chinese home-styled tofu (jia chang dou fu) but overall, the quality of food was below average. Service here was less than satisfactory as well - we ordered tap water but the waiter surprisingly said that they didn't have enough glasses. How is that possible? if you can serve hat many people in your restaurant, you should be able to have the equal (if not, more) amount of glassware!! In the end, the waiter promised 8 glasses of tap water for our group of 13, but in the end, failed to deliver ANY of them. My friend had to fume at them to get some glasses of water over. And when they did finally deliver some glasses of water, one of them actually looked soapy/bubbly on the side, which is REALLY DODGY-looking for something that is supposed to be only water. None of us attempted to drink the water (or liquid) in the glass that was served.In conclusion, below average food, less-than-satisfactory service. I guess that's why the price was actually quite affordable and there are so many customers on a weeknight. Not my kind of restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for typical Chinese cuisine or Szechuan cuisine.",

The food is \"authentic\" but the service is so horrible that it isn't worth the trek all the way to Spitalfields. \u00a0I spent a year living in London and my building just so happens to be right down the street from this restaurant. \u00a0One day, I stumbled upon this place wondering why the place was packed with Asians (mostly Chinese-speaking people). \u00a0So I decided to give this place a try. \u00a0I've order the cold cut pig ears combo, the sichuan stuffed eggplants, dumpling soup, various noodle and stir-fried dishes. \u00a0Based on my visits, I've giving this place two stars for the following reasons:Pros:1. \u00a0Very close to Liverpool Street tube station, about a 5 minute walk -- starting from Bishopsgate, walk left toward Dirty Dicks pub (yes, it's really called Dirty Dicks!) across the street and then make a right onto Middlesex Street. \u00a0Keep walking until you hit the end of the road and then make a right (with the Japanese Canteen on your left hand side). \u00a0Walk about 1 block and there's the restaurant.2. \u00a0The food is made to order; it isn't pre-made like some of the other Chinese restaurants (take-out) in the area.3. \u00a0The food is authentic. \u00a0When you order it \"spicy\", it really is SPICY and I'm talking about spicy for someone who grew up eating spicy Asian and Mexican food !! \u00a0The seasoning is generally good BUT I do think it's a bit on the sweet and sour side sometimes (which is really annoying but I understand they have to cater toward the White folks).Cons:1. \u00a0When you get take-out, they put the food in plastic boxes. \u00a0Talk about BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT! \u00a0 They need to get their act together and figure out how to package food in paper boxes. \u00a0Maybe take a hint from other restaurants?2. \u00a0The waitstaff is R-U-D-E. \u00a0Simply rude. \u00a0They barely speak English and they completely ignore you when you walk in unless if you literally SHOUT AND POUND the table for service!3. \u00a0The menu is entirely in Chinese -- and it's Simplified Chinese, so if you're from Hong Kong or Taiwan, don't bother. \u00a0Just bring a Mainland Chinese person with you. \u00a0They do have an \"English menu\" but LOL that is NOT the real menu!4. \u00a0This is really the thing I hate most about this restaurant -- it's CASH only. \u00a0Really? \u00a0Are they living in the 1950's or do they think they're still in China? \u00a0I'm sorry but it's a bit ridiculous when I buy 30 GBP worth of food and they still act like I'm ripping them off when I offer to pay with my DEBIT card. \u00a0Word to the Wise: \u00a0DON'T COME TO THIS OLD PLACE. \u00a0Just not worth it.",

Each time I've been there, they ran out of tea. What kind of Chinese restaurant runs out of hot water? To make things worse, the party next to ours were clearly being served pots of hot tea. My (Chinese) friend who has worked in the Chinese restaurant business asked for two basic dishes that appeared on other patrons' tables and we were shut down yet again, only to see the same two dishes show up hot out of the kitchen at another table minutes later. When we questioned this discrepancy, the server brushed us off and said some groups receive preferential treatment and not to look at their dishes. Last time I checked, this was a mediocre Chinese restaurant with questionable sanitation, not a high end night club!",

Having been here 3 times I can confirm that it serves consistently good quality food in big portions albeit with poor service which is typical of Chinese establishments.\u00a0Their Szechuan dishes such as the Dan Dan noodles are spicy with a pleasant \"kick\" rather than overpowering chilli. The barbecue skewers are good value with well seasoned meat, the Cola chicken wings were perfectly glazed and gently sweet and succulent. The steamed fish is big and ideal for sharing.\u00a0Unfortunately you may find that sometimes certain food items may not be available to order e.g. one time BBQ skewers were not available and another time the handmade foods were unattainable, but this is a good indicator that the food is freshly made and dependent on individual chefs and/or cooking methods. So whilst the seating maybe a little cramped, the decor basic and the service a little reluctant, My Old Place is a satisfying choice and certainly a favourite amongst Chinese folk in London who are \"in the know\".",

She didn't tell us any reason but just waved her hands for us to get out. Confused, I asked her why? (There was another hour before they closed). Unfortunately, she did not want to elaborate. She only wanted to wave us out. As my friend and I stood at the door figuring what to do, she then came over and said you can have their seats (this other table) and order quickly. I told her yes, we will be fast, we only want to order skewers. She then said no, waved her hands at us to get out, and walked away. WHAT? Great customer service here. I grew up working in Chinese restaurants, so I can relate to her struggle. She basically wanted to close up shop on time and go home. Then she changed her mind and wanted to make a few extra \u00a3. And when she realised it was just \"snacks\"... she told us to go away. If I'm being completely honest, I have always found it's overpriced mediocre northern Chinese food. I can deal with mediocre food, because sometimes, you're too lazy to do it yourself. But the price I pay should also reflect the service and every time I've been here, the service has been subpar compared to anything in Chinatown.Word of advice: Don't trust what is written as closing hours because they clearly have not decided when they want to close.",

    "text": "Decided to check this out primarily because of the brilliant reviews and feedback on Yelp! I also had a very big craving for some Pork Dumplings.Went in during lunch time with a friend and the place was full. We were asked to go down to the basement and the basement had only a large table left and we were told that we cannot sit there. After some to'ing and fro'ing we were allowed to our table.Menus came in , the place looked literally bursting at its seams. There were lot of people complaining about delay in getting the food and we sort of looked at each other and then decided to try to our luck.Got the first bad news when we placed our order for dumplings. We were told that Dumpling chef apparently is not feeling well so no dumplings! Finally when we made up our mind on alternative stuff, the waiter said that his order taking machine is not working due to poor reception and that we must wait. After 10 mins we successfully placed our order. Starters of Veg Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay and Chicken Fried Noodles and a Chicken with Chilli in Dry Pot and some Green TeaThe Tea came quickly, and in a stainless steel pot. The starters came next, both were average but the Peanut Sauce with the Satay was very nice. The mains took forever, more than 30 mins to arrive. When it came, it was pretty ok. The Chicken in Dry Pot was probably the hottest chicken dish I have tasted in a very long time, it made my tongue numb! Probably because it had excessive green pepper. There as absolute lack of attention from the staff while we ere eating, we had to try hard to get the staff's attention. Being in the basement didn't help, as we got an impression that folks upstairs were getting all the attention. While we were eating, we saw once of the staff spilling green on a customers back, a group of customers walking out angrily and another one going away without even sitting. Probably all in a days work for them but I didn't enjoy my time in there.They do not have a lunch menu, the prices are bit on the higher side but the portion sizes are generous. One main can be shared by two. The mains do not come with Rice or noodles and \u00a0needs to be ordered separately.I will probably go back once more just to try the dumplings but it will take me some time to get over my first experience.",

    "text": "I always see this restaurant popping up on the internet for one of the best Chinese in London so I thought I'll give it a visit. The place specialises in Northern Chinese food such as Szechuan but does the few typical Cantonese dishes as well such as the sweet and sour. The place is big with plenty of seating and I love the decor being very reminiscent of China with it's red against cream walls hanged with the typical open out paper fans. Tables of solid dark walnut oak tables neatly lined gives this place a slight olden day feel.It's kind of cheesy but I have always associated that with Chinese restaurant. I don't think any other cuisine can get away with having Christmas balls across their wall all year around like they do. It's also the sort of place where service is fast and efficient but just don't expect any courtesy as they barely smiled during our dining time here.Sea whelks, peanuts end cucumbers in black vinegarThis wasn't marinated long enough to allow the vinegar or garlic to pickle and infuse with the cucumbers. I took it home and had it the next day and the flavours were much more apparent. The whelks were also far too chewy and tough and probably weren't very fresh. I did enjoy the crunchy textures in the dish though with the peanuts which added a nice saltiness and nuttiness to the dish. Braised pig's feet. If you like your gelatine jelly like texture like me then this is the dish for you. Generous portion of soft bouncy pig's feet that effortlessly comes off the bone as soon as you bite on it. It was slightly on the salty side, going overboard with the soy sauce. But I still very much the rich sticky marinate especially when accompanied with rice.Beef and potato stew. Deliciously braised beef and sliced potatoes until the sweet soy braising mixture reduced, creating a thick sticky paste around the meat and potatoes. The flavours were very intense, full of depth and flavour. Once again it was slightly on the salty side but with rice it was okay.Broad clear noodles with chilli oil This was too bitter of a peppery herb for me (I'm guessing it was Szechuan peppercorn). It also had a weird sticky sap sensation which I didn't quite understand and made eatong hard. It lacked that balance in flavour, needed to be more sweet and sour. Wasn't for me I'm afraidFried mixed spinach, preserved egg and ham The answer to a cold day. Cooked in broth it became like soup dish. The spinach were fresh, silky and juicy, seasoned nicely, full of depth and umami from the roasted whole cloves of garlic, chicken stock, preserved eggs and spam meat. It was a pretty simple dish but wholesome and delicious.We finished this dish completely. I did enjoy My Old Place. It's refreshing to open up a Chinese menu and see some new and unusual dishes. \u00a0At first prices don't appear any cheaper than Chinatown restaurant but the portions are almost double the size. Very generous and great for group sharing.Some of the dishes were a bit too generous on the salt though but mostly forgiven from the rich flavours produced in the dish. Every stewed dish was lovely and soft which shows this place gives time and patience to it's food. \u00a0Will aim to return but maybe with a bigger group so we can order more stuff to try.",

They serve a lot of szechuan style food, although they are a north-eastern rstaurant, and a lot of non-western type of ingredients - cow tongue, intestines, pig's blood, liver, kidney, etc., etc. - and cooked so well!We had a cold dish that marinated slices of beef and beef tongue, cabbage stir-fried with vermicelli (AMAZING), and twice-cooked pork. The dishes aren't cheap, approximate 8 to 10 quid per dish, but the portions are pretty big! the dishes i mentioned above, together with two bowls of rice and a beer worked out to be about 37 GBP. We had some leftovers and walked away with full belly.The service is pretty typical chinese - but nothing to actually complain about. Some of the ppl who work there are really nice but they just dont provide you with the western service you expect with a lot of smiles and making sure you are happy. You will need to insist on paying with card because they prefer cash.Definitely worth a trip here if you are craving legit chinese food.",

    "text": "Everyone is constantly rocked by waves of FOMO because the menu is massive, the portions are massive, and everything looks so damn tasty. I got the Szechuan beef noodles and a skewer of lamb. The noodles were weak and were falling apart in the soup. Not much heat so I doused it in chili oil. The lamb skewer was tasty, but not the best I've had. Hard to catch the eye of the staff for service since they're so busy and will often be zipping towards the kitchen.Worth another visit for their other dishes though!",

    "text": "This is by far my favourite Szechuan restaurants in London. I have tried so many and no one place can compare to this. This place is always busy but saying that u are almost guaranteed a table within 5 minutes. The food is amazing, not to forget that they are so generous with the portion size ! My favourite is definitely the \"mouth watering chicken\", and the \"spicy fish soup\". Onto the service- in my opinion they are really under staffed. As the place is always busy a d has two floors I don't understand why they would only have four people on the shopfloor. They can get a bit snappy when it's very busy and some times they refuse to let you add more orders.....but they can be nice when it's more quiet.Overall I'm very impressed with the quality of the food and I have already returned 3 times in the span of two months. Try it out !",

    "text": "It's been a long time since my previous review although I've been eating here on and off ever since so it's about time that I updated it.First off, they accept credit cards now! Yes, the sign in the window announcing their card machine is broken is finally down. I'm not sure I thought I would ever see the day, but you no longer have to nip into the Co-op down the road to get cash before you eat here.The food here has continued to be decent and generally tasty, and, as a few people have mentioned, the portions are massive. There have been some duds that we have added - the deep fried aubergine doughnuts and the plate of sweet corn fried with pine nuts which turned out to be an plate just full of corn (way more corn than even this corn lover could take) - but there's a higher probability of getting something that tastes nice. It's a bit of a lottery for us as we like to order at least one new dish each time, and we have found that it is the vegetable section that seems the most fraught with misunderstanding.There have been a few hiccups here and there which haven't detracted from our generally good experiences here. We found a slice of pork which had made its way into our seafood fried noodles on our pescetarian day. It was not a biggie as we spotted it before someone ate it, but, still, the dish was not supposed to have meat in it. Recommended dishes include the pork dumplings (slightly pricey but delicious nonetheless), the lamb skewers (which have improved over the years), and fried beef with cumin. Service, believe it or not, has improved over the years as well. The servers now speak English (more or less) and can occasionally be open to a bit of banter (usually when paying the bill). It is a Chinese restaurant though, so, as others have mentioned, it can be hard to get their attention given how busy they are.",

    "text": "This review is rounded up. I will update based upon next visit. Pork boa was amazing. I wish I had just ordered 3-4 of these for my lunch. Pork and chive dumplings were pretty standard. Unfortunately, they were served only with soy sauce. No vinegar? No chili oil? I brought half of them home and plan to spice them up with a little Sriracha. Pork and leek dumplings were presented very well but the skin was a bit gummy for my liking. The filling was acceptable but not a whole lot of flavor. Again, a ginger infused sweet vinegar sauce would have made all the difference. The reason for rounding up: almost every other dish around me looked absolutely amazing! The smells were awesome. I read a review saying that the dumplings were great here so I had to try those. Next time, I'm sticking to a boa and ordering some spicy chicken or pork dish. The diner across from me had an amazing smelling and looking soup. Perfect lunch for a cold rainy day.",
