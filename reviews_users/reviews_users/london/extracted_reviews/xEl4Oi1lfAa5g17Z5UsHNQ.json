I have been here several times and tried most of the dishes, as well as the tasting menu.For me, the stand out dishes are the aloo chat, tandoori prawns, venison keema naan and the muntjac biryani. Perfect for dinner with a large group and I'd highly recommend the private dining room that sits a max of 9 people. The private dining menu is great value for money and allows you to try a wide range of their best dishes.",

    "text": "Horrible, rude service. On a recent trip to London, I was so excited to try this place thanks to rave reviews and the Michelin star. The ONLY reservation available was at 10:15 pm on a Thursday, but hey, we were only in London for a few days, so I took it. Seeing that their kitchen closed at 10:30, I reached out to the restaurant beforehand to make sure that their full menu was available. They assured me it was and was no problem. 10:15 on Thursday, my boyfriend and I walk in, and in a half empty restaurant, they seat us next to the serving station. No one greets us or takes our drink order or tells us about the menu. My boyfriend goes to the bathroom, asks me to order him a drink. I sit, wait, still no one acknowledges me. Finally, I ask the man standing right next to our table at the serving station if I can get some drinks. He takes the order. Then comes back much later to take the food order. I ask him if there's a shorter version of the 6 course tasting menu - maybe an uncouth question, but whatever, I have seen places with three course tastings and six course tastings, and since it was 10:15 at night, obviously this was not our first dinner. We were more interested in sampling the best of the menu without over-ordering too much food a la carte. Rather than answer me, the server stepped away, spoke to another server behind my boyfriend's back and told him 'she want's a 'shorter version' and used air quotes, clearly mocking me to the other server. This other server then stepped in and said no. I asked him what the best vegetarian dish was. He said the saag paneer. Really, the most basic vegetarian dish is your best one? OK sure. \u00a0I say none of this to the rude server, but I'm thinking it. We say we aren't that hungry, and he says we can get a half portion. We get samosas, the aloo chaat, naan basket, and a half portion of saag paneer, because again, it's 10:15 at night. He then repeats the order and says 'a full portion of saag paneer'. We say no, a half portion. Then we ask if it comes with rice. He says 'oh, you want this.' And points to something on the menu to my boyfriend, which I can't see. When the food is served, it includes a whole other dish that we didn't want or order, and yet they forced on us and charged us for! By this point, not only was I pissed, my boyfriend was pissed that he tried to up-sell us so shamelessly AFTER being rude to us. Then when I gave my card to pay the bill - over a $100 dollars USD by the way for subpar food - he hands the card back to my boyfriend instead of me. Rude AND sexist. Disgusting behavior for such an expensive place. If 10:15 is so late that you stop showing good service, then don't allow 10:15 reservations in the first place. Saag paneer, as predicted, was just fine. A huge chunk of cheese floating in spinach. Awful service. Not worth the hype. Pissed that I wasted my time in London here.",

    "text": "I truly don't know how this place has only 4 stars as of the writing of this review. This was - hands down - the best Indian food I've ever had. Yes, it's pricey, but it was entirely worth it.We started with a couple of cocktails, which were really delicious. I had the Flutterby, which was a perfect homage to Indian cuisine and paired nicely with my dishes. My wife had the Quinine Sour, which was fantastic as well.We had two starters, two entrees, some naan and a side which was more than enough and probably way too much. The Potato Chat was maybe one of the best things I've ever eaten, with a wide variety of flavors and textures, and just the right amount of heat. The Paneer Tikka was the best paneer we've ever had - delicious and creamy. Definitely recommend both.Side note: I'm a wuss when it comes to heat. I enjoy it, but it has to enhance flavor, not just be there to blow you away. It's rare that I eat something spicy and think to myself \"yes, that heat was totally appropriate and made the dish taste better, not just mask any other flavors in the dish.\" This place nailed it.We went a little on opposite ends for entrees. She had the Chicken Butter Masala - a classic, but super delicious and well prepared. I had the Muntjac Biryani, something I've never had at all. It was almost comfort food, but very unique with the pomegranate and the meat was super tender. I'd order that again in a heartbeat, but there's a lot else I'd like to try too. Decisions, decisions...We rounded it out with some Saag Paneer. I was too enamored by my own dish (and the generous portions of everything) that I didn't really try too much of it. But my wife said it was better than any other Saag Paneer she ever had. We, sadly, couldn't finish everything. But we tried so hard.I highly recommend this place. It was one of our most memorable meals on a trip that included tons of delicious food. Our pocket book would be quite empty if we lived in London, because we would eat here all the time if we could.",

We sat downstairs, which is dark and intimate. The place was full as you'd expect on a Friday night, but the tables are far apart enough to give you proper space.We ordered a la carte, and were recommended five dishes to share as starters from the first three sections of the menu. We had south indian fried chicken wings, which were more like lollipops and super tasty, aubergine pakora (I don't even like aubergine and I loved this!), signature dish kid goat methi keema - which features minced meat with caramelized onions and spices. It is served with mini-bread rolls, so you can turn it into something resembling a hamburger.Then we also had wild tiger prawns and tandoor broccoli (one of my favourites).From those dishes alone, I was hooked. We then shared butter chicken, crab curry and suckling pig curry (which was pretty spicy), alongside basmati rice and a bread basket.Dinner for 3 came to \u00a3191 with a round of drinks for start and a bottle of wine. I'll be back, as soon as possible!Worth noting that there's a bar downstairs to hang out in before eating, plus a tasting menu at \u00a355, early evening menu at \u00a325 for 4 courses (Mon-Sat 6-6.30), a game menu at 5 courses for \u00a365 and a special lunch menu; 2 courses for \u00a320 or 3 for \u00a325.",

    "text": "Prepare to see a lot written about this place... This latest Mayfair big hitter (from the hand of Trisna founder Karam Sethi) is already a darling of, among others, Time Out, Fay Maschler and big Jay Rayner. The latter having managed to spectacularly annoy the frothing loons below the line in the Guardian by having the temerity to airily suggest that at \u00a370 a head it was superb value for money. While there are very few who would dispute that you can get close to as good for a lot, lot less money, this wasn't deliberately a Guardianista baiting claim. Given the location on the same block as Mahiki, where clueless braying clods regularly compete to spend more of daddy's money than the other yahs on insane champagne and oh so accurately named cock-tails, it's not bad value at all, and it's a world of calm class away from the hoorays and their nightclub tuckshop Roc Lobsta.There's something quite confidence inspiring about a short menu, though it's rarely seen in an Indian restaurant. You won't be pleased if you were desperately seeking your chicken / beef / lamb in a generic gloop, but then there aren't many places nearby that are so unreconstructed. It's a calmingly brief list that takes you by the hand, leads you to a comforting rattan Raj era chair and fetches you a gin and (matched) tonic before suggesting that you accede all thoughts of ordering and let Karam and his team decide.We don't quite give them that leeway, but do grab what promises to be a seasonal standout on the gamey menu - the wild Muntjac biryani - as well as a host of smaller plates from the snacks and starters. \u00a0A minced kid goat and onion Methi Keema deeply steeped in fenugreek, pepper and other spices is sprinkled with shreds of deep fried potato, a flavoursome and texturally lip crinkling delight, genuinely one of the nicest things I've eaten in some time. After nailing the soft buttered rolls it was served with, we resorted to the serving spoon so desperately were we trying to scrape the Crown Derby pattern off the artfully mismatched dining plates.Other small plates, from a similarly small menu, were more hit and miss. Wild mushroom and sweet potato Shikampuri kebabs were closer in taste and texture to falafel, not unpleasant, and raised from tedium by a thick girolle raita, but I wasn't fighting to claim the third puck. Venison keema naan on the other hand was exceptionally light and sweet.Served showily with a thin crust dotted with nigella and pumpkin seeds, the pastry lid of the biryani cracked to release fragrant steam and soft, perfectly cooked insides. Morsels of braised deer were scattered throughout a subtle rice, like dark jewels in the sand. The only missed note (for me) was a pomegranate and mint raita too close to a sweet dessert yogurt in taste and texture. I'm in a minority of one here, my dining companion greedily scooped it solo from the bowl. For me a better accompaniment was a dark smokey aubergine Khati Meethi side, its seductive and silky textures inevitably will come back to haunt me in moments of abstinence.Happy I got in there before the reviews, sad that it's unlikely to become a regular due to the, now inevitable, queues. Gymkhana stands out as one of my meals of the year so far and, if you can get a table, is a divinely decadent treat for an autumn supper. As a critical smash as well as the new favourite takeaway (yes, of course they do) to the Mayfair set, it's clear that they plan to be here for the longhaul.",

    "text": "I heard of this restaurant before leaving the US. From the owner of another Indian restaurant. He believed they have a Michelin Star. If they don't have one then they deserve two. The experience was exceptional.They offer a number of different tasting menus. One focused on fish, another vegetarian and the third was general carnivore. We chose the latter.It's a seven course tasting menu but with choices at each protein dish. We each took a different dish where there was a choice . Which meant we got to taste 10 dishes over dinner. Every one of them was spectacular. Even the Dahl which I usually avoid was made very tasty by adding some or the roast wild boar vindaloo \u00a0sauce to it.By the time we got to the last main course we were already full. Dessert just cleansed the palate.I had Jameson whiskey sours throughout the meal, which were equally spectacular. The service staff were friendly and approachable, unlike other Michelin restaurants we have visited. While I wouldn't know a Michelin a Star from a Michelin Tire, if this level of service is what Michelin brings then it's worth it.Thank you for a great evening and a very special and memorable dinner.Dress can be casual or formal.",

    "text": "London is not a place known for it's food, and after eating places in London, it was pretty apparent. How much skill does it take to drop fish and batter in hot oil? It doesn't take a skilled chef only in UK to do that. London, however, is known for Indian food, and I was set on trying the best of it. Luckily, my friend took me to Gymkhana, otherwise I wouldn't have never known to set foot in here as it doesn't have a lot of yelp reviews, and it also has a ridiculous name. Seriously, who would eat at a place called \"Gymkhana\"? Only did I hear it was a Michelin star restaurant was I convinced to go. Looking at the menu, it definitely wasn't your typical Indian restaurant. They used exotic meats, and mix them with Indian spices and sauces. Sometimes it's a gimmick, but it worked surprisingly well here. We got the Quail Seekh Kabob, and it was the juiciest tastiest Seekh Kabob I have had. I've only seek Quail offered in Asian restaurants, so I was really surprised to see it here, and much less as a Seekh Kabob since they are made with ground beef. It actually tasted like ground beef somehow, but juicier, which was amazing. The Wild Boar Vindaloo was good too, and had a good amount of spice. We also got the lamb Biryani, I judge an Indian restaurant by how their Biryani is, and it passed with flying colors. It had a nice char taste but was authentic. The naan was also nice and charred/crunchy on the inside, soft on the inside. Gymkhana definitely is not street Indian food, but moreof gourmet Indian, and exactly what I was looking for in trying Indian food in London, a chef that pushed the limits of traditional Indian cuisine.Update: This 5 star review has brought Gymkhana to a 4.5 rating territory from 4! Well deserved, Gymkhana...",

    "text": "Although it has been referred to as an 'upmarket curry house', I think Gymkhana deserves more praise and attention than that. The Mayfair facade of the restaurant is not a true testament to what's hidden inside - a tribute to the old colonial clubs of India, complete with retro ceiling, black and white photos, booth style seating separated by wicker-style screens. Even the bathrooms have wooden toilet seats. A great venue for dinner with friends, second date night (a bit too intimate if seated downstairs for the first date) or dinner with the parents.The \u00a0menu includes club style nashtas (Indian all-day snack fare), sharing plates of tandoori kebabs and sigri grills, and curries and biryanis. There are some interesting feast menus for groups featuring game birds, suckling pig and kid goat raan.We arrived before 6.30 so qualified for the discounted tasting menu. Don't expect standard Indian dishes (although you can find plenty of the favourites on there too). Each dish had a distinct flavour - smooth and mild, dry and spicy, sweet, savoury - nothing standard about this place! The exotic cocktails on offer perfectly complemented all the flavours. And service was so smooth that the transition from one course to the next was just right - no waiting for hours to get through all the courses. Service was impeccable though it was a bit hard to understand what was in some of the dishes. All beautifully presented in uniquely decorated bowls and plates. Overall, a great dinner out with lots for the eyes to feast on.",

    "text": "FINALLY. An place that proves Indian fine dining can be worth getting excited about, without leaving you feeling ripped off and yearning for mum's home cooking (because you know she could make something just as tasty and feed 20 people for what you just paid).I've enjoyed sister restaurant Trishna before, though that takes quite a fusion approach with their version of fish+chips and such like. Gymkhana doesn't go quite that far - dishes are more traditional for the most part, albeit with an impressive choice of game that betrays the British influence (wood pigeon, deer, grouse etc).Whilst the tasting menu was calling to me (loudly at 6 courses for \u00a360, and even more so at the magic words 'wine pairing'!), not everyone was up for it on this occasion. I was dining with 3 veggie mates and an omnivore, so we went a la carte and ordered almost one of every veg dish for sharing.The food was excellent, with truly such complex flavouring to each mouthful that I almost wanted to eat in slow motion to really appreciate each one. It was like a pop-up window went off in my head, saying 'oh thiiis is the kind of indian food that I'd eat out for!'.Everything from the chaat (an indian street food staple) to the mushroom methi biryani to the masala chicken dish I shared with the other meat-eater was carefully spiced and tasty. We didn't even get the usual one duff choice that everyone tries to avoid until it's left over at the end. I was made supremely happy by the choices going on in the bread basket alone, which probably tells you something (other than I'm a carb fiend). I had a refreshing Icy Spicy mocktail of mango and ginger too which worked just fine.It was tricky to get the waiters' attention sometimes, not helped by the fact that it seemed to be a different person looking after us at each stage of the meal, and moreso that they tended to stand with their back to the entire room in between serving. Something to work on, though once at our table their manners were impeccable. Feel free to ask them to explain dishes if you don't know your bhurji from your bhindi, as most of the dish names listed are hindi/english hybrids.We were sat in the dining room at the back, which is a beautiful wood-panelled space straight out of the colonial era, with old photographs and memorabilia bits framed on the walls. And very dimly lit. So much so that a waiter brought over a reading light that clipped onto my menu to save me using my phone (embarrassing but necessary!).It's unstuffy, relaxed and quite cosy in the back room, so works best for a small group or a date spot I think. A yelpy little bird also tells me they gained a Michelin star this week, which seems deserved after my experience and I haven't even tried any of their signature game dishes yet. I'll definitely be back for some tasting menu/wine pairing fun...",

    "text": "Not since Oliver Dabbous burst onto the London dining scene with his eponymous restaurant in 2012 have I seen such a collection of outstanding professional restaurant critics' reviews. In fact, Gymkhana came onto my radar when James Knappett of Kitchen table fame recommended it to me as his current hotspotI was already a fan of Trishna, Gymkhana's older sister restaurant, which shares its head chef - the self taught Karam Sethi. So, it was a no brainer to give Gymkhana a whirl and I headed there one Monday evening with my sister and fellow Yelper Tirthankar D, who is my Indian food guruThey've tried to evoke the atmosphere of a colonial club with ceiling fans and tropical style seating. the restaurant seems to be set up more for small groups with intimate fixed tablesLike Trishna, they've got an a la carte menu and a good value tasting menu (7 course for \u00a355). I was particularly impressed that our waiter was very customer orientated and flexible. There was a choice of 2 main courses on the tasting menu and we politely enquired whether they would be prepared to substitute another dish from the a la carte menu for a main course so that we could try more of the menu even though we ordered the tasting menu. In the end, we decided not to do that as none of the suggested dishes grabbed us. However, when our main courses arrived, he had arranged an extra main course for free, which was a wonderful surpriseI chose an icy spicy mocktail because it had mango in it but I struggled to taste much mango. However, my Alphonso mango lassi had much more mango in it.My sister and Tirthankar chose the Spicy Monopoly cocktail, a spiced rum daiquiri with coconut milk, served with orange blossom ice creamBefore the tasting menu began, they served us a little basket of popaddoms made with different grains. It was a served with a great shrimp chutney, which was a foreshadowing of what was to come - it was deep with umami and heavy with spicing yet retaining the essential shrimp flavour. We asked for an extra portion of this chutneyAs you can already guess, I was a fan. At this stage though, I want to state why Chef Sethi has wowed the critics. Not is he an expert at balancing the spice mix to enhance the ingredients but he has got a skill unparalleled in my experience of making that spice flavour of growing through the mouthful as you chew but also of getting that flavour to grow between mouthfuls, so that your palate and brain is left \u00a0with bewildered amazement at the complex combination of spices. This late lingering profile of his spicing leaves a memory to savour and carry with you1. Potato Chaat, Chickpeas, Tamarind, SevPerfect balance of textures and flavours elevated this street dish to the best that Tirthankar had ever tasted2. Lasooni Wild Tiger Prawn, Red Pepper ChutneyJuicy plump huge prawns enhanced with a layer of spices, the heat of which was tempered by the sweet chutney3. Gilafi Quail Seekh Kebab, Pickled Green Chilli ChutneyA good kebab but I preferred the one at Trishna4. Kasoori Chicken Tikka, Sprouting Moong KachumberWho would have believed that the humble chicken could be elevated to such heights? Perhaps the dish which surprised me the most5. Kid Goat Methi Keema, Salli, PaoA fun dish where you piled the goat mince onto bread to make your own open face sandwich. This dish embodied best the aforementioned property of the flavour growing with each mouthful6. Suckling Pig Vindaloo; Butter Garlic Crab; Partridge Pepper FryThe stunning butter crab was the one crossover dish from Trishna and with good reason. The suckling pig was succulent but too hot - it's odd that something this hot was on the tasting menu. Our free dish, the partridge was lovely7.Chestnut & Date Kheer; Saffron Pistachio Kulfi FaloodaGet the kheer! A stunning end to the meal - Indian rice pudding with deep undertones of caramel and chestnutGymkhana pips Trishna and now sits as my joint fine dining Indian restaurant together with Amaya. Well, all those critics couldn't be wrong, could they?",

    "text": "Very tasty food and excellent decor. Like the China Club in Hong Kong, this restaurant harks back to the days of colonialism, featuring photos and paraphernalia from the British Raj in North India. Unlike the China Club, the staff don't make customers feel like they are actively participating in cultural hegemony and oppression. The menu is mostly game-based, but as I went with my mom (a full-time vegetarian) we decided to try all the veg dishes. The samosas were pleasantly puffed, a different style than the usual crispy ones, and I was surprised by the beetroot kabob: they were like beet falafels topped with a beet cream and an additional spicy mustard dipping sauce. The highlight was clearly the tandoor ghobi, a roast cauliflower dish with yogurt. I'd eat that again in a heartbeat. The veg sides were all delicious. I'd definitely return to try some of the game.While we waited for a table, I perused the drinks menu and eventually ordered a Spice Monopoly, which was delicious spiced rum with homemade orange blossom ice cream, served separately in a tiny tea glass. They have an amazing selection of rums and gins at the downstairs bar.The only negative thing I can say is that while waiting for a table we were ignored completely - that very British way of interaction where staff refuse to meet your eyes no matter how patiently you wait or how intently you stare. It took about half an hour of waiting before they finally offered us seats at the bar, which they apparently didn't think of offering before. Definitely make a reservation!",

The service is the reason this place doesn't receive a perfect 5 stars from me. The staff aren't massively attentive and quite hard to get a hold of. We celebrated Valentines Day here (booking was done 3 months in advance). We were so happy with the food that we over-ordered quite a bit with the hope to try many different things and take the rest home. Unfortunately, our take-away bag was swapped with someone else and we received some chewed-into bread with teethmarks in a bag. Quite disappointing as we quite looked forward to enjoy the food on the next day.on the way out, my wife was handed a small box of chocolate as it was Valentines day. On our walk to the car, she opened the box to find it empty. Quite an embarrassing thing for a restaurant of this calibre.The food has my mouth watering, but the service has me second-guessing a re-book.",

We left there thinking, \"Well we're never coming back here again\".There was another event here that sounded really interesting. It was focused on the wine, and pairing unexpected wines with Indian food. Because my partner is such a wine fan, I suggested it to him, and to my surprise, he agreed. So we came back.Can I just tell you how much a year and a half changes a place? Yes, the event was atypical, but I was blown away by the food and really how tasty it was. From the start of the meal which was a selection of poppadoms made from different legumes with the most amazing shrimp chutney I've ever had and the samosa papdi chat, on through the fish courses of tandori scallops and bass, onto the keema and the biryani, and finally the dessert, everything kind of blew my mind. I've been converted. Plus the great night learning about wines really made it special. But I think I'll come back for the food any time. It was really fantastic.",

After eating most of the papadams, and ordering a mango lassi, I downsized my 3-course to a 2-course meal. Got the goat egg, lobster burji for the 1st course, which was in a thick gravy and served w/ a fresh paratha. This was really filling, and I almost wanted to reach for my pillow for a nap afterwards. I barely had any room for the tandoori chops, but at least ate the chicken. I unfortunately did not have room for the dal, aloo, or rice. Great flavor combinations, and definitely incredibly rich. Masala chai to cap off the meal was a nice touch.",

It wasn't bad, but definitely not strong tasting. \u00a0Points for creativity though.For dinner I got their six course tasting menu for \u00a360. \u00a0The dishes ranged from bite sized to appetizer sized but then got to entree sized portions. Dishes were:1. Potato chat - spicy and well seasoned vegetarian dish. \u00a0Good start!2. Wild Tiger Prawn - only one prawn, but a good sized and perfectly cooked one. \u00a0It has nice spice and goes well with the mild creamy red pepper chutney.3. Salmon Tikka - I actually ordered the chicken tikka but this looked so good I tried it. \u00a0Skin-on salmon was cooked perfectly - so soft and juicy and the green sauce added some distinctive acidity. \u00a04. Kid Goat Keema - actually three dishes - a buttery bun, side of minced onions with a grilled green chili and the smallest, cutest wedge of lime I've ever seen, and a dish of minced goat with fried onions. \u00a0It's like a riff on sloppy joe but I ate all three separately to avoid making a mess. \u00a0The goat was spicy and very addictive - not gamey at all. \u00a05. Curry Plate - yikes this was a five-component dish. \u00a0Piping hot garlic naan, very long grain white basmati rice, shrimp curry, lentils, and these amazing roasted potato balls coated with these black spices (not pepper but some kind of seed). \u00a0I had trouble finishing this dish - everything was so good and savory. 6. Saffron kulfi - Dessert was two tiny scoops of pistachio ice cream, with a side of cream to up the sweetness if needed. \u00a0Great finish to a wonderful dinner.Service was great throughout - several waiters and even the bartender helped refill my water - necessary since 5 dishes had good amount of spice.",

I tasted the lamb chops and they were a succulent feast from the gods. If I make it back to this side of the Atlantic I will be getting this dish again. For dessert I ordered the Wattalapam which was like an aromatic dense panna cotta served with banana raisin ice cream. It was a beautiful dish though very small it was satisfying. Since I didnt make a reservation I sat at the bar. My bartender was this friendly tattooed Roman man who was serious about his craft and made some pretty amazing cocktails. He made me a variation of an Aviation (gin, egg white, lemon , violette and a secret something). I highly recommend.",

    "text": "Gymkhana:Having knowledge of the exceptionally high quality of authentic Indian cuisine offered throughout London, I researched Gymkhana, holding one Michelin Star, acclaimed to hold the title of National Restaurant of the Year in the UK. \u00a0Prior to my vacation, I was not able to make a reservation, but I knew that the full menu could be ordered at the bar; I put Gymkhana on my list before traveling across the pond to London and dined here September 2015. \u00a0Overall, Gymkhana was exceedingly deficient in service (save the pleasantly engaging bar staff), lacking any regard for diners who were not Indian. The staff seemed to practice ethnocentrism and discrimination-- actively enacting racial prejudices toward Caucasian diners. One of the managers, Raj, ignored us the entire three hours of our $450 (\u00a3300) dining experience, yet actively engaged Indian diners. Their food, however, was delicious and is perhaps the sole reason for their one Michelin Star. \u00a0I've rated Gymkhana one star; should their service and attitude improve, it may edge upward. \u00a0Being a well-seasoned gastronome, I expected much better service. See below for a more detailed review. Reservations:I learned of Gymkhana a few days before my trip to London, so I was not able to make a reservation. They do serve their full menu at the downstairs bar (beautiful d\u00e9cor and wonderful bar staff, Aron and his partner Skol). \u00a0We met some resistance with the main hostess, Nicolette. \u00a0She repeatedly told us that there was no room at the bar, despite any attempts to consult a colleague to check the downstairs bar for availability. We ultimately decided to bypass the incompetent girl and were stunned when we found a completely empty bar downstairs--bartenders welcoming us with open arms. Unbelievable. This was our first taste of the ethnocentric attitude and racism toward Caucasian diners that Gymkhana practices; there was more to come later. D\u00e9cor:Styled after an Indian colonial club; bathroom featured aesthetically pleasing exposed copper. Libations:To start, we all ordered a glass of an Indian red wine (who knew that India made red wine!) and enjoyed it. \u00a0Later, we transitioned to gin; their gin collection is one of the largest I've seen! Monkey 47 (unique and excellent), Oxley (local and smooth), Martin Miller's, Plymouth Navy, Sipsmith, and No. 3 were among those we tried. Bread:We ordered naan (not included) and found some pieces to be more burnt than others. Dinner Dishes:Gymkhana offers a variety of menu options, ranging from \u00e0 la carte to two tasting menus. Having done our share of fine dining and Michelin-Starred tasting menus during our time in London, we opted for the \u00e0 la carte option. Under the guidance of our waiter, we ordered kid goat, potato chat, kasoori chicken tikka (spicy), lasooni tiger prawns, methi malai curry (spicy), saag makkai, and a few others. All dishes were excellent, with the kid goat being a much-enjoyed favorite. \u00a0I would most likely not dine here again, as London has a plethora of Indian cuisine, but if I returned, I would order similar dishes, but perhaps not as many. Although, it is nice to try as many dishes as possible.Dessert:Being quite full from our entrees, we shared an order of the ras malai--an excellent version of rice pudding. We also sampled some rose-infused truffles, which were uniquely delicious. Service:Nicolette, the girl at the front reception, was thoroughly incompetent and should be removed. \u00a0Her ineptness nearly prevented us from dining that evening, which may have been intentional. \u00a0Aron and his colleague at the bar were both exceptionally pleasant and made our evening one to remember. \u00a0There were numerous Indian managers scurrying around during the evening. \u00a0We inquired, and Raj was the manager who frequented our downstairs seating area. During our entire three-hour dining experience, Raj never once came over to us to ask how we were enjoying our evening. \u00a0Absolutely unacceptable for a one Michelin Star establishment. After spending $450 (\u00a3300), I like to be stroked to an extent. \u00a0Furthermore, Raj engaged each and every Indian customer; what a flagrant display of ethnocentrism and discrimination. \u00a0Expect the same disregard if you are a Caucasian diner. Summary:Gymkhana serves delicious Indian Cuisine, and the d\u00e9cor is lovely. The staff overall have a penchant for fellow Indian diners; you will be snubbed to an alarming extent if you are Caucasian. My Recommendation:Pass. London is burgeoning with Indian cuisine options; seek out other establishments where you will be treated more favorably. 1 Star Michelin Star: One (2016)",

I was so excited to eat at Gymkhana as I read a lot about it (most of the review I read, people were invited to eat there).They won a Michelin star so I thought it would be a very special place for Indian food, now I know that doesn't mean anything at all. We left the place and both thought that next time we want an Indian dinner we will just go to Dishoom. Two dishes were really good and special but the rest was just nice. Service was surely the worst ever and I never felt so rushed before in a restaurant. For sure service is the reason why our experience at Gymkhana was not as we were expecting and we didn't take time to enjoy the food and the wine.",

Based on regional cuisines from across the subcontinent, the cooking is modern in approach, and the spice can be serious without overwhelming the layers of big and subtle flavours that bring this menu to life. There is even a nice touch of theatricality: Indian punches come in sealed medicine bottles, with an ice-filled silvery goblet on the side. Recommended by Timeout.",

We were impressed with the service and had a superior experience at the bar prior to being seated. \u00a0The Negronis were excellent. Our meal began with the baby goat and beet root dishes which I would say were the highlights. After that, it just seemed portions were large but flavors and quality suffered. We over-ordered, something we'd been consistently warned against at other London establishments but not here, and we left food to waste which I hate to do. Unfortunately, overall I'd have to say this meal didn't merit more than 3 (maybe 3.5) stars. I'd skip it if I had it to do over.",

We opted for that suggestion, except we each wanted our own butter masala chicken. The butter masala is fabulous. The chicken had a wonderful tandoori smokiness. In addition, one of the starters was a fish cooked with a cilantro sauce (like the green samosa sauce). This was among one of the best things I've ever eaten. And even some of the more 'standard' parts of the meal were outstanding. The shrimp and tomato chutney served as the appetizer was so delicious. And the naan was outstanding. Especially the garlic naan!Flavorful, casual Indian food with some extra intrigue, expected of a Michelin restaurant. Great service, fabulous food, and tremendously good value for the lunch tasting.",

Then came the crab, it was a whole fried soft shell crab on a bed of puffed rice. It was quite good and quite spicy though a little dry. Then came the chicken chop which was absolutely fantastic, maybe the best chicken I've ever had period. It was well spiced, had nice char marks, was juicy, and super flavorful. I didn't even touch the gravy as it didn't need any. The leg chat was also very good. It came with a side of garlic dal, potatoes, and rice. The dal and potatoes didn't blow me away but were good, I found the dal a little bland personally.

She'd come to check on whether we needed anything and seeing the barely touched plate pushed away, made inquiries on what the issue was, and apologized sincerely. Unbeknownst to us, and without promising anything, she let the kitchen know and came back with a fresh plate of the tangy and crunchy appetizer where the heat level had been knocked down a few notches... amusingly, my friend couldn't even finish that one!Gymkhana, named after high end clubs in the days, and reminiscent, of the British Raj, is deserving of the different dining accolades it's received: from the Michelin Star to the UK national restaurant of the year in 2014. You can look beyond the marble tables, oak paneling, and hunting trophies and actually appreciate the food, which lounges effortlessly on the corner of innovative and comforting. If you've missed tikkas, kababs, and masalas, make your way here to find dishes that have made optimal use of the tandoor and charcoal grill. The Tandoori guinea fowl reminded me of the best versions of the dish from my childhood: grilled to the precise nanosecond where it's retained juiciness inside while having the requisite char. At Gymkhana, \u00a0you won't find the meat covered in a dye that evokes colors from a tanning salon nor will you find the coating of batter so thick as to overpower what it envelopes. Staples of Indian cuisine like Lasooni Daal and Aloo Methi are executed precisely as well. While we enjoyed the (Haryali) bream, it's fair to note that the menu excels when it comes to game, and there are plenty of options for those that cherish it.Unfortunately, the desserts underwhelmed me completely: lacking any of the imagination or innovation that you see otherwise in the dishes. \u00a0The apple and blackberry falooda with rabri kulfi was merely competent despite the promise of its ingredient pairings, and the cardamom and fig Kheer not only was boring, but bland as well - not too mention poorly executed with the rookie mistake of not being sweet enough (perhaps striving to keep the flavors dainty and subtle, but overshooting in that goal).",

Gymhana is located in the bustling Mayfair neighborhood and boasts a colonial feel with a fabulous bar and cocktail list and authentic Indian food with a focus on wild game meats. I started with the the venison naan and a nicepeanut salad. Both were really unique dishes. The naan came with a superb cucumber and mint raita but I didn't love having meat in the naan. The peanut salad had a nice flavor of masala and fried lotus root. The butter chicken masala was the best I've had. It was creamy and rich with really tender chunks of chicken. Wild boar vindaloo was great too. It had the perfect amount of heat that lingered a little but wasn't overwhelming. Rice pudding (kheer) to end the meal was lovely with a scoop of pistachio ice cream hidden under the rice.I will definitely return! A must if you're looking for fabulous Indian in London.",

We started with 2 punch drinks - one came with fresh cinnamon you can shave into your drink yourself, another came with fresh nutmeg. Super creative, great presentation, and delicious!For food, we got the duck egg + lobster appetizer, and potato puffs. Potato puffs weren't good at all..the duck egg and lobster we couldn't get enough of.For main, we got the buttered chicken, tiger shrimp, pickled veggies, rice, and bread basket. More than enough food for 2! Everything spicy but good (even the pickled veggies!)We finished the meal with coffee and green tea. Skip the tea - extremely basic and plain, not worth the upcharge.Restaurant is designed well. Huge door to open the restaurant, it's right next to the Alexander Wang store. There aren't a whole lot of seats, but the center walkway is wide so it doesn't feel stuffy or crammed at all. Make reservations super early!!",

I still recalled my last encounter with a Michelin starred Indian restaurant, Benares, with a certain level of horror as that was just horrendous. Gymkhana does however play in a totally different league. First of the service was truly top notch throughout the meal, the waiter always anticipated when we had questions and were always there when needed without us feeling as if they were hoovering around the table either. They were gret at explaining what the dishes were and making recommendations on what matched.We had a selection of dishes (one of us had the taste of Gymkhana lunch menu and then we added a few random dishes to that) that really showed an impressive range of different food. One favorite was the Dosa with Chettinad Duck and fresh Coconut Chutney. It was just perfectly spicy. The Potato Chat, Chickpeas, Tamarind and Sev was also very nice and fresh with a touch of spiciness to it. The Tandoori chicken was also very nicely prepared, both nicely char-grilled and tender inside. We were really pleased with entire experience. The cocktails were really nice and they also did some really nice wine pairings with the food. Gymkhana really changed my opinion about fine dining Indian food and I will be back here to sample more of the food.",

    "text": "I'm really baffled by the Michelin rating assignment. You can eat at a \u00a0Michelin star restaurant meal in London or New York without breaking the bank. That's a fact. You cannot do so in San Francisco. You just can't. They must be handing them out like candies in London and New York. Other cities have to earn it. Both in the quality of food and the price of the meal. I arrive with much skepticism. Indian food in the bay area and Vancouver are really good. In fact the top Indian restaurant in North America is in Vancouver, if you ask me. \u00a0I've had superb Indian food for local people in and made for white people in India. I have Indian friends who take me to hole in a wall places in the South Bay and they are always superb. AND I have had a lot of Indian food in London in the past. How exciting could it be? Well, quite, actually. For starters, this a fancy pants place. The decor is impressive and very British actually. The drinks were very good. A full on service bar. But here is the real kicker. For a lunch set menu, it's only 25 pounds. Basically $38 a head. For a Michelin star restaurant. Insanely affordable. I went for the dosa duck and Kid Goat, rose flower ice cream for dessert. Other party had paneer and \u00a0tandori chicken chops.There were so many other things to get like the duck egg and soft shell crab, Alas, one only bring one stomach to lunch.I liked the option of bread basket or rice as the carb options. Get the bread basket to go with your kid goat. It's stellar. Sauces for dipping that were creative and innovative. I wish the restaurants in San Francisco bay area could take notes from this Michelin starred Indian restaurant. Indian food can be better than they are back at home.A couple arrived and were seated next to us. She's Chinese. He's French. They were having a tough time, and were fighting quite a bit. I sat awkwardly because I can understand what she said under her breath in Chinese. I knew everything she said on the phone with her friends in Shanghai too. Poor dude was not getting any break. But, after the food were served, it appeared that they finally had calmed down and stopped making a scene. They were all of sudden making up by having a civilized conversation about the food. I'd like to think good, scratch that, excellent, food does that to people. Outstanding food make people happier, and thus more forgiving of one another. (Note to people of dating age: go to a nice meal and make up. Stop fussing over small things.)Bonus point, it's minutes away from Fortnum & Mason. After lunch, stock up on your teas and biscuits befitting of the Queen's mother before returning to the States.",

    "text": "Terrific dinner at Gymkhana, which is a very unique and interesting restaurant. \u00a0Modern interpretations of Indian cuisine set in a thoroughly non-Indian setting. \u00a0When I entered, Gymkhana was not what I expected - it felt more like a neighborhood bistro than a cutting edge Indian place. \u00a0The room was instantly comfortable and in no way hinted at the tour de force that would be presented.The a la carte menu was very interesting but we couldn't choose - so much looked good - so we opted for the only sensible choice, the Tasting Menu. 6 courses of yumminess and it is a lot of food, so be prepared.Everything was clearly identifiable to its classic precedents, yet none of the dishes were like Indian food I've previously had. \u00a0For the Chicagoans amongst you going to Gymkhana felt like the first time I went to Arun. Arun changed my perception of Thai food forever and Gymkhana was similarly mind expanding.Our menu was:- Papads with Shrimp and Mango Chutneys- Samosa Papdi Chat (the most subtle and intriguing Samosa I've had - a dish not normally associated with subtlety).- Peanut and Green Mango Fish Tikka (served with a lovely Sake, this dish was again subtle and surprising with a wide palate of delicious flavors).- Kid Goat Methu Keema - another of these mind-expanding dishes, it's presentation looked like typical Indian food but the flavor profile was deeper and more varied than normal.- Pork Cheek Vindaloo - tender and delicious. I overheard the table next to us remark that it was too spicy, just as I was thinking it would benefit from a bit more heat. \u00a0No accounting for taste I guess, though the entire affair was flavorful without being spicy (IMHO).- Mango Kheer - super light and delicious mango rice pudding. \u00a0It took me straight back to southeast Asia, but was unlike any mango/rice I've ever had.We had the wine pairing which I thoroughly enjoyed - the wines paired extremely well with the food (a feat I never could have accomplished on my own).Service was good, and the pacing of the meal and the feel of the room made for an enjoyable evening out. \u00a0 Gymkhana is highly recommended and the \u00a370 price for the tasting menu was a terrific value.",

I initially thought they would have a fresh take on Indian food, perhaps incorporating some fusion dishes. We had the tasting menu. The first few dishes were a traditional papadam and chaat. Nothing special. Just brought out in fancy tiny dishes. The tandoori fish tasted like they slapped some Shaan masala on a small piece of fish. The rice was undercooked and the prawn curry was inedible! I am shocked as to why this place has the reviews it does. Again it's all about presentation with this place and no substance!! The overpriced menu is NOT worth it! Go get some real Indian food from a hole in the wall.",

    "text": "An Indian restaurant with a Michelin star - enough said. Indian restaurants rarely are graced with such honors (unclear why given how amazing and diverse the cuisine is). One step into this establishment and you immediately know why this is one of the few that has managed to snag such a recognition.The decor harkens back to yesteryears that it almost feels like a time warp as you enter through the nondescript doors. While the door may be nondescript, the food is not. To take traditional Indian cuisine from different parts of India, give it a twist - yet pay homage to the original flavors, is mindbogglingly hard to do; Gymkhana exceeds where others may have and will possibly fail. The Aloo Tiki reminds you that it is just like all the other street stall tikis you may get in India, but elevated to a level of sophistication that is more appropriate in this \"high society\" setting. The Dosa which comes from a completely different part of India is just as delicious and again maintains its authenticity while still been given a twist to make it into something unique. The same goes for the samosas, the gol guppas (which should be ordered just for how fun they are to eat), and the mango lassis. Lastly, don't even think about skipping dessert in this place...if your wallet can manage - order one of everything and eat to your heart's content. This Indian restaurant is a must for me whenever I am in London. PS - Mindy Kaling also seems to be a fan of this place, so you know it is legit! :)",

Our party of 4 ordered a bunch of different things including naan, goat biryani, daal, bindhi, plain rice, two chicken dishes, and kachumber. I only had the daal, rice, and kachumber, which were nothing special but pretty good.A couple of negatives: the restaurant was out of shrimp and gol guppa, which I found odd. Additionally, there was a charge for the papadums, which is typically free at just about every Indian restaurant.Lunch was good but I won't be rushing to return here.",

We had been wanting to come here for a while, given the hype around this being the best Indian food in a city full of great Indian places, and it lived up to those big expectations. We got a bread basket, the tandoori masala lamb chops, wild muntjac biryani, tiger prawn kebab, and dal maharani. We were blown away by the lamb chops, loved the biryani and the dal, and really liked the kebab. This was a lot of food, so while there were plenty of other things on the menu I'd like to try as well, they'll have to wait until another visit (the kid goat, quail seekh kebab, dosas, chicken butter masala, lamb shank -- too many to name, really).I also got a mango lassi to drink, which I actually wasn't that crazy about.Overall, a fantastic meal. Dishoom had always been our favorite Indian place in London (or anywhere...) and I think this surpassed it in terms of pure food quality. (Dishoom is roughly half the price though, so there's obviously a tradeoff there.)",

I was dining alone so got a weird single table but no matter, I came here to try London Indian food. First off, I don't know much about Indian food. I eat 3 dishes usually. Tikka masala, butter chicken, and Korma.  Yikes the menu had stuff that wasn't familiar. But they did have butter chicken. The waiter recommended a starter. A goat dish, their speciality. Kid goat methi keema, Saudi, pao. It was a bit spicy, but I'm kinda wimpy. Waiter was nice and offered yogurt. The butter chicken was delicious. Creamy. Tomatoey. A bit spicy. The chicken is dark meat. One piece had s bit of gristle but otherwise delish. Overall service was wonderful. Food delicious. If you're in the area do visit. It's 10:30pm and the place is still packed.",

Both floors were full of such elegance...that of which you would expect at a gentleman's club. The drink menu was extensive.The cuisine at Gymkhana is impressive! We decided that we would go on the servers recommendations for dinner. She did a great job directing us to dishes we thoroughly enjoyed and had perfect quantities for the four of us as we ate family style! The ingredients were fresh and delicious...the chutneys giving just the right balance to each bite of food! Gymkhana was awarded a Michelin Star in 2014 and I see why. Both the quality and creativity in the food and it's presentation were impeccable. Our evening was well spent enjoying each other, good food and great ambience!",

More \"casual bistro\" than \"Michelin-starred restaurant\". What makes Gymkhana stand out even more is the creativity with their dishes, several of which incorporate a modern twist to classic Indian preparations. Don't leave without trying their kid goat keema and wild muntjac biryani. The lamb chops were also some of the best I've ever had, although quite pricey.",

We had on Vegetarian sample menu and mixture of other dishes and you can share, this is the best bet as you get a lot of food and having the variety is great. The food options and flavours are second to none and not a fusion place but indian food done well with care and attention to the detail in the flavour. I do not mention the drinks but they do a wide selection including a good selection of Mocktails.  Dress Code: Everyone was smart or smart casual but I don't think they have any restrictions Booking Process: Very easy to book on the phoneLocation: 42 Albermarle Street, London, W1S 4JHCuisine Type: IndianDecor & Lighting: Always dim lit. It is nice but nothing too special. Heating and Cooling: The resturant has AC but not overlay cold. And got out but nice inside. Not too hot and not too cold. DB Level: 78.6Db, it was easy to talk and even though all tables occupied we could still have a nice conversationWe had the following: Papad : A good selection of different types of papad with a nice mango chutney and also a great chutney with prawns but nothing to spicy. All home made the way it should be. Aloo Tikki chat : Full of flavour and a good size portion to share. Traditional flavour as you would expect. \u00a0This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menu. Planner tikka on a Sweet corn chat : Again good portion to share and a nice traditional taste with twist of sweet corn. Also the middle layer had a distinct but complimentary taste which really sets this aside from a good Indian resturant to a great indian resturant. This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menuDosa : Another great traditional tasting and full of flavour and with another little twist in the tomato sauce which I also enjoyed. Which is like a reduced thickened Dal as you normally but a great compliment. This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menuChicken tikka : Really succulent and good size portion, perfectly cooked with a nice spicy marinade that just kicks in a few moments later. Comes with a great beetroot raita that helps cool everything down. This again shows the subtle differences that make a difference on your pallet which all just work together. Channa Bhatura : Traditional but not oily as many others. This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menuBlack lentil : Traditional taste but something at least you know what you will get each and every time. This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menuAubergine : Normally I hate aubergine but this is special and I fully recommend you try this dish. This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menuMuntjac Biriyani with rose petal raita : The Top pastry is cut off by the server and put to the side. Great portion size. A Crispy pastry so you get it all from pastry to rice and meat so a whole meal in one. Sweet tasting rice and deer cooked well and taste more like light lamb and not gamey at all. Raita : There was a special hint of sweetness and tang but perfect blend to go with the Biriyani and makes the dish completely different. This was part of the Vegetarian sampling menuBill / Cost: \u00a3160.88 for threeConclusion: A great classic resturant with some great flavours and excellent service. We have been before and each time we leave with a smile and full belly! If you want something traditional which can cater for vegetarians as well and has a few twists this is the place to go.",

The food can be a bit spicy if you're not used to spicy foods, otherwise you should be fine. Overall the main entrees are really the stars. The papadum to start is light, crispy, and diverse with two nice chutneys. The appetizers are very enjoyable but not outstanding, still though I would recommend the potato chat. Of the main entrees, the hariyali bream is fantastic, the tandoori chicken pretty much slid off the bone (and had a wonderful sauce with it), and the kid goat was complex and super tasty. Truly can't go wrong with any of them!",

The boo and I decided to do the four course dinner last Saturday in between Harry Potter play acts (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). Dinner opens at 5:30 PM and we figured we would be a little rushed for time so we got there before it opened. We were immediately seated at 5:30 PM. They were full of reservations (luckily, the bar has a full menu and is walk-in) but since we were early, the hostess said she could seat us at a table if we left by 7:30 PM.We started off by ordering Mango Lassis. They were excellent, and came in handy since some of the food was spicy and yogurt is the perfect way to calm your tongue. Then we had one of each things on the four course menu (four courses for \u00a335 per person from 5:30-6:00 PM. With service fees, I think it comes out closer to \u00a350 per person). We had the:Prawn chips and chutney to start. Yum yum!Potato Chat: delicious and the portion size was huge! Loved the slightly sweet yet spicy flavoring and the chickpeas were spot on.Hariyali Bream: a lighter, delicate dish. Liked the simple flavoring and mildness of the fish.Tandoori Gobhi: spicy cauliflower! It wasn't too spicy, but I was glad I had the Mango Lassi. The cauliflower was a little overly grilled for me.Chicken Butter Masala: oh my gosh, is this what butter chicken is actually supposed to take like?!? It had this amazing smoked flavor and the sauce wasn't too creamy or heavy. So amazing! I think we both wish we had ordered two of these.Saag Paneer: similar to the chicken, the paneer was way lighter than the paneer I've had in the States. It featured nice mild flavors and some big chunks of paneer. We enjoyed it, but if we were to go back, we'd probably get two chickens. The mains also came with Dal (amazing lentils), Aloo Methi Mattar (mild potatoes that were great as a side), rice, and naan (believe these were of the whole wheat variety).Mango Kheer: we were both super full and couldn't even finish the mango rice pudding-like dessert. It was nice to get a fruity flavor after all the potatoes.Ras Malai: loved this! If I could just drink the liquid normally I totally would. It was especially good with the little cookie they gave us with our check.The service here was excellent, and they do a great job of pacing out the food based on how fast you eat so we were able to make it back to the theater with time to spare. We were both so full for the rest of the night. Would definitely come back, especially for more of that chicken.",

There were three types of naan: plain, garlic, and mint. The vindaloo was quite enjoyable, but to me it just tasted like a good curry, definitely one of the better ones I've had, but with nothing really innovative or mind-blowing that would justify the price. The level of spiciness was just about right.3.5 stars",

We have the 5 course meal and EVERY DISH was fantastic. The meat was perfect, the spice level was there but not dangerous, and the service was attentive. Even the drink menu was awesome with aptly named drinks. The cr\u00e8me brulee was special because it had gulab jamun in it, very nice treat. Super convenient to the theaters as well, easy to find off several tube lines. Do yourself a favor and go if you're craving more-than-authentic Indian food.",

The problem with Gymkhana is it's trying to beef too many things all at once hence not really delivering on any! We went for the lunch menu which at 25 quid in Mayfair for two courses is quite reasonable, they give you some papads / deep fried crisps with three chutneys, shrimp, mint and sweet, all three very average and the shrimp Chutney, was hoping will be similar to what you get in Goa, Kerala, but not to be \u00a0tasted like a Delhites attempt at bad South Indian! I had a dosa with duck, there only flavours I got from the duck was onions, similar to the shrimp Chutney. Similar look and taste from the Kheema and bheja ( and I was really looking forward to this given its my favourite spare part if the goat/ lamb), again onions aall over. The only thing that rescues them with a third star is the polite and courteous service!",

Not sure why any sane family would bring there 6 and 10 year old children out to eat this late at night. We happened to be on EST from traveling here a couple days ago. After the more than 1.5 mile hike there with the kids, we were tired. The restaurant was packed. The hostess looked at us if we were crazy for walking in off the streets without a reservation. They were however VERY accommodating. After a short wait, they showed us to one of the best tables in the house located in the downstairs eating area. The entire staff quickly tended to our needs. Not exactly sure when I last experienced this incredible service. I am sure it was in Manhattan at a very expensive steak house in mid town. From the starters to the main course and excellent advice on scotches, we were completely amazed at how EVERYTHING came together from the moment we walked in the door to the helpful and VERY accommodating staff. I HIGHLY recommend this as the BEST Indian reaturant I have EVER had the opportunity to attend. As for recommendations from the staff. My favorite was the Lamb shank nihari aloof chokha and Lamb nali Barra. We had other amazing courses throughout and the kids loved the chicken butter masala. You won't be disappointed in your tasting journey or anything this staff can off you.",
