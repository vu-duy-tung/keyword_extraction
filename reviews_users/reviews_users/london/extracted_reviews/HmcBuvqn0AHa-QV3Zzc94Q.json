Maybe it is my bias toward meat, but i was left slightly disappointed by this restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, the service ok and it's not a bad place. However the food wasn't amazing. The place is cheap, which is a bonus, but then it is vegitarean (and vegetables don't cost much!). I can't quite remember what I had (it didn't make a massive impression) but it was foamy and kind of like a pancake. It was pretty tasty and comes with a nice sauce. This place is no doubt a decent place for some tasty, different Indian grub. However I have to say that I am unsure if I'll go back (which shows that I wasn't overly impressed).",

Well this place proves you can.Simple decor inside, the menu is packed full of stuff you wont come across in ordinary locals. But the prices remain scarily cheap.Dishes are made with care. A good gauge is always what's on offer on the chutney carousel and their chutneys are lovely. Delicately spiced limp pickle, good sweet mango, sweet yoghurt and mint and a nice coconut one.We both ordered a thali each which also comes with starter. The starter was a veg pakora with a nice accompanying sauce and some poppudum.The thali came with about 8 dishes. All felt wonderfully authentic. Lots of runny dals, some paneer, fried aubergine, veg curry, creamy stuff, spicy stuff, a real lovely mix. And two of those fried bread things which puff up. Forgive the ignorance. All I can say is the whole lot was damn tasty and they had to roll the pair of us out of there having spent a meagre \u00a330.With Zing up the road for a classier curry and this down the rough end, we're spoilt for choice. There are other good 'locals' here but this is a cut above at student prices.No frills, just lovely tasty authentic food. It has something of a reputation with in the know locals. Those traveling in for a gig at the odeon or something should deffo give it a crack.",

The best thing about dining at Sagar (and there are many wonderful things to chose from) is the fantastic service this place provides. You are not even done drinking your water before they refill it! At Sagar, they never try to push you to order more, they treat you with respect. The atmosphere is elegant and it is reasonably priced. I always get the chana masala which is very clean, fresh and not oily, an Indian rarity. The entire restaurant is vegetarian but as my partner can attest, it is so delicious and accentuated by fresh touches that even meat eaters \u00a0are blown away. Everyone should eat at Sagar if only to be treated like a queen without paying queen's prices. Or king's prices. Or drag prices..ok nevermind.",

Even if you're not a particular fan of vegetarian food, I recommend it, as the food is very nicely prepared, and they specialise in dosa which are not always easy to find elsewhere. Just a small caveat: they don't always make explicit on the menu exactly how hot the dishes are likely to be; that's fine if you like your food hot (I do), but if you're a bit more sensitive to chilli then you might want to check with the waiting staff (who can be a little stand-offish, unfortunately) before ordering.",

I normally prefer the spicier 'Chennai Dosai' but I have to say this Udupi style restaurant stands out and is definitely very well suited to English tastes as well as to more spiritually minded people who normally steer clear of really spicy food.The lunch thali is superb value for money and every item is immaculately cooked.A word about the staff- they are not unfriendly at all, but respectful. This is the older tradition of Indian catering and is not in keeping with the street ambience of Hammersmith. A middle aged South Indian like myself can see that the staff are actually very good and well trained- 'devo athithi bhava'- the guest is God, in Sanskrit, is their ethos. However, young English people would expect a more informal smiling sort of service. Still, since the Udupi chain has a sort of 'Spiritual' ethos and since the food is very well prepared and 'pure' (sattvic) one can say the respectful service is in line with the branding. The decor too is above and beyond what one might expect from the pricing.Ultimately, food is about health and well being. You can't go wrong eating at Sagar. It more than keeps up the Udupi image and tradition.",

When we entered, the place was jam packed with people and it was a surprise we could get a table. The table we were seated on was in quite a cramped area. When we saw a larger table freed and requested for a change, the waiter was nice enough to let us switch.When I opened the menu, I was delighted to read that the cooks are from Udupi - my hometown! Such a delight. The food is more like the \u00a0kind you would find in a Mumbai Udupi Restaurant (or \"Udupi hotel\" as they are famously known in Mumbai). It was interesting to see a shift from the usual 'tadka dals'. It also brought a smile on my face to see the actual bhaji (dry/semi-gravy cooked vegetables) instead of the new age onion bhaji.We ordered the sev puri, rava dosa, masala dosa, limbu pani and mysore coffee. The sev puri was pretty good; so were the dosas and limbu pani - quite authentic mostly. We were quite disappointed with the sambar that came with the dosas - quite bland and almost like dal. When asked how we are enjoying our meal, we pointed this out. The waiter voluntarily got us a spicier version - something more akin to how sambar is supposed to be. The coffee was strictly ok.The staff is quite busy - it felt closer to home where the staff is hustling and bustling around. They are very warm and sweet with service and customer engagement. Ambiance can do with a makeover. Tables quite crammed - need some spacing out. Overall a good, closer-to-home feeling for good South Indian/Udupi restaurant food.",

(to start) Masala DosaAloo Ghobipooris and riceI love this restaurant in Hammersmith and am constantly surprised at the relative dearth of vegetarian Indian restaurants in London. The great thing about eating in one is that it is always an adventure and well removed from the Bengali/North Indian staples we are all used to.The starters were good. I hadn't had Idli before and to be honest could probably give them a miss next time. Whilst they are unusual, I found the dumplings a bit too bland for my taste. The bonda were brilliant-golfball size balls of mildly spiced mashed potato surrounded by a hard crust-utterly brilliant.The masala dosa is always a show stopper-a massive Churchillian cigar of a pancake filled with spiced potato etc. The aloo gobi was also great. All this was mild by North Indian standards, so don't expect it to be hot, but they are wonderfully light and you don't get the same bloated feeling that follows a normal curry (maybe due to no ghee?). A welcome difference and the large bottle of Cobra was very welcome ( as always). Give it a go if your nearby. Four stars not five just because I wasn't a massive fan of the Idli, but other might be.",

    "text": "Having both a wheat and onion allergy it's refreshing and very exciting to come across a place that lists their onion free (as well as garlic free), nut free, vegan and wheat free options in a special menu. There were plenty of options to choose from but in the end I went for one of the Uthappam with tomato and added cheese. It was REALLY good. I also had poppadoms and fried idli which were more like fries than rice dumplings, not that I'm complaining! I took my mum along who is not a fan of Indian food. Why? I asked her. I don't like spicy curries, she said. Not all curries are spicy and not all Indian food is curries. She came along and looked really unsure about it all. She ended up getting a very mild curry and LOVED it. I kid you not, she even said she'd come back and have it again. My Dad wasn't as easily converted but he thought his dosa was okay. My partner really enjoyed his curry too. My mum and partner both wolfed down some desserts, jaggery dosa with ice cream and mango sorbet, both of which they enjoyed. The fresh orange juice was good too.The service was a little slow and a few strange things like they'd bring three glasses of water to a table of four people. It wasn't amazing but it was really good and I wouldn't hesitate to return.",

    "text": "Having already visited the Twickenham Sagar, I went here with a vegetarian friend. As with my experience in Twickenham, I found that this was a fantastic restaurant with wholesome food of a very good quality. The meal was very affordable. I had the thali (a selection of different dishes served in small bowls on a plate),which I had not had before, but would recommend as it was very tasty and nice to try the different options. I would say that I prefer this restaurant as it is bigger and airier as there is more light and therefore the Decor, whilst simular to Twickenham is more appealing.",

We have tried virtually every South Indian item in the menu and cannot find any fault with their renderings of the South Indian staples. \u00a0You might want to stay away from their north and West Indian dishes. The bhel puri is below average. South Indian stuff is top notch.",

    "text": "A driver from the airport recommended this restaurant since I was staying in Hammersmith.It's the BEST Indian food I have ever had!!!EVERYTHING on the menu is vegetarian. Indian food is usually vegetarian friendly already, but to have all these choices, what a bonus!Fried Idli-This, I would describe as a savory corn bread, the texture is quite similar.Mysore Masala Dosa-Curried mashed potatoes in a flaky pancake, love the two combined textures, it just oozes down your throat. Saag Paneer-House-made saag. Yes on the cheese, please. This was less green than I'm used to in the states. There was some red to it.Vegetable Biriyani-The rice was so soft. Everything was perfectly seasoned! What a party in my mouth! This is a nice restaurant with what seems to have an awesome lunch menu and cheap prices. If you are ever traveling in the area or even a local, you must try this place. Now, I've got to fly all the way to London just to get some Indian food. I sure am spoiled now.",

I have been to one or two similar places and always left feeling as if I made the wrong choice.I have never been to India and are therefore unable to judge quite how authentic this place is (apparently a lot, according to our friends' friends). I also don't know what to expect from puri, dhosa and uthappam ... the menu offers only very basic descriptions while the staff offer absolutely no guidance!Excellent if you are feeling adventurous and safe as it's all veggie - ie no danger of being served sweet and sour offal ... the fact that it's vegetables only also accounts for prices that seem cheap at first sight.We went in a group of four and all ordered different dishes, everyone opting for something they had never tried before. They didn't actually taste all that different which was a bit of a disappointment.This place is excellent for novelty value - I have certainly never been served a dish as massive as these \"pancakes\", crispy creations made from lentil. I have also never been able to take a photograph from within my food - you can admire the result above.I have a vegetarian friend who is a big fan of Kerala - she is about the only reason I would return. There is such a great choice of Indian restaurants in London with similarly good, if not better, food - and with much friendlier service. The staff really let the place down, they were as cold and unfriendly as the decor.",

The place itself seems a bit cramped maybe a couple of tables too many, so it can be annoying when children are running around, so I would recommend going on a weekday. \u00a0And another thing, \u00a33.75 for a takeaway box is stupidly cheap so it must be taken advantage of immediately.",

I prefer it hands down, every time, over northern style dishes. and Sagar did not disappoint.The space is filled with warm wood walls, very modern, with low, but not too low lighting and tastefully selected Hindu/Indian statuary. Our waitstaff were very attentive, if not overly so. I ordered idli and a masala dosa. My 2 pieces of idli came out freshly steamed and with what appeared to be in-house made coconut chutney and sambar. My dosa was crispy and delicious, with a lightly spiced(less spicy than I am used to) potato filling. I ate almost the whole thing. I'll try the mysore masala dosa next time for more kick!I am excited to go back and try their lunch boxes, which looked packed full and are incredibly cheap. We're talking under \u00a35!",
