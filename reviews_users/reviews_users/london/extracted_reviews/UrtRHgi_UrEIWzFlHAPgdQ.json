    "text": "To celebrate our work mates last day we had to treat her to lunch. Not because we were happy to see her go of course... But because she is going travelling and we're all horribly jealous!A colleague recommended this place for a quick bite to eat and a natter, so we wandered along. 12.30, 8 people table with no reservation is a good start. Also, their 2 course reduced lunch menu for \u00a39 was a steal. So far so good, right?!Nice decor, with interesting paintings of Middle Eastern clothed people over the walls and those cute light decorations made the atmoshpere in here very welcoming. No incense though, I half expected a rich, fragrant, heady aroma from this place.We sat on ornately decorated chairs (that felt like they were made for primary school children... they were low down! And not in a Flo Rida kind of way). I ordered hummous to start (expected) and chicken kebab with salad for main, others in our party had lamb with a red lentil soup to start. All very tasty, although they tried to serve me the soup twice which was a touch annoying. Hummous could have done with more accompanying bread, I hate having leftovers. Chicken was nicely fragranced but could have done with a marinade to hold the dish together. Service was a bit lazy if I'm honest, the waiter did not really know what was going on and took AGES to let us pay, not great when you're all doing the 'looking at your watches cos you've overrun your lunch break' dance.But a fond farewell to a fabulous colleague",

We regularly go to some mediterranean restaurants in the New York/New Jersey area of USA, however, this place is better than all other places we have been to, so far, for mediterranean food. They atually have more vegeterian option than all other mediterranean restaurants we have been to. Borek was definitely appetizing. My husband ordered adana kebab and I ordered veg dish moussaka. The food felt refreshing and delicious. I ordered hot chocolate which was okay as it was made from cocoa powder unlike real chocolate which we like, while my husband loved the liquior coffee he ordered. For a perfect finish, baklava was our choice and we must confess, it was indeed the best baklava we have ever had. Would definitely come here again. I am sure if Troia would be in New York/New Jersey, we would be their regular customers.",

This place has great authentic decor and very friendly customer service (it helps when you're in there every week...). The food is great. Being the man that I am, I always go for the mixed grill, which is a decent portion, and along with the free bread and olives they give, is definitely enough to fill you up. Good for group gatherings (advanced booking required as it is a small restaurant) and a great place to take the mrs too (or mister...). The price is just about right, nothing overly pricey on the menu.So if you want somewhere with good atmosphere, great service, good food at a reasonable price, then this is the place to go if your in the area.Oh, they do shisha too!",

It was indeed the best food we had in London. I'd say it tied the restaurant at the Sanderson hotel (the fancy fusion one), except that restaurant was about 100x more expensive (and this wasn't exactly mcdonalds).We had a big tapas style ordering of about 20 or 30 different dishes so we got to try a lot of different things. Highly recommended.And as a whole, highly recommended in London, unless you particularly enjoy mushy peas.",

We ordered the iskender kebab and a few starters to share between the 2 of us. The starters were great, really enjoyed the falafel and they are absolutely generously portioned. The staff are absolutely lovely and attentive but not over the top, so we had privacy and time to enjoy the meal also. The iskender is a really lovely take on the traditional one I had in Istanbul, really enjoyable. Will definitely go there again and try out the shisha option also.",

Troia is a delightful Turkish restaurant and cafe to satisying ALL tastebuds. With a HUGE selection of delicious starters (order several mezze-style and share amongst friends), perfectly-cooked main courses and sweet, fresh baklava for dessert, you cannot go wrong. Troia runs great both lunch and dinner specials, so you can eat on the cheap and still leave with a full tummy. My favorites were the goat's cheese samosas, the fried haloumi, yoghurt/mint/cucumber salad, & hummus with hunks of lamb. Mains are the traditional shish/kebab variety, but the lamb I had was so incredibly tasty & smokey (seared perfectly on the grill) that it's not like anything you'd EVER find in a cheap takeaway. The mains are simple, really, because it's the starters that star here. The baklava was yummy, if not a wee bit sickly-sweet, but everything was extremely generously portioned. Service was excellent with waiters everywhere just waiting to wait on you hand & foot. If you're willing to sit outside, they also offer a lovely shisha",

    "text": "I hate this place.Sure, it's a touristy area, but that doesn't mean that the restaurant and its staff can treat tourists this way.First thing when we got in: a waiter with an attitude. After my friend asked if the burger came with cheese, he looked at us like he had no idea what we asked. We didn't order any wine, and he just looked at us like we weren't worth his time while collecting the wine glasses from the table.There were four of us, so we each ordered a dish. What was completely ridiculous was the fact that the food took OVER AN HOUR for it to be ready. How hard is it to scoop up some stew that had been braising for a while, grill a burger, fry some wings, and plate some salad? We had to ask two waiters if they could check on the food. Mind you, these were two different ones from the guy who took our order. The first guy never got back to us; the second one was a lot nicer but still kept insisting that it was still cooking. If he had told us that it hadn't been cooked yet, we would have walked out. I do regret not walking out because really, it was awful.Food finally arrives, and the four of us just want to leave because we're so hungry and the food tastes mediocre so we quickly scarf it down. My wings, which come with a side salad and rice, looks sad. The best part was the rice, and that tells you a lot. Wings were flavorless, tiny, and the \"salad\" was undressed, old, wilted lettuce. A waiter that I flagged down insisted that this was just the color after prechopping it. Psh, yeah right. Friend's salmon stew looked discolored and unappetizing.You can definitely bet that we did not leave the discretionary service charge. What a terrible experience.I'm so surprised that this restaurant was so busy the day we went. I rarely write a one star review, but to those who happen to read this: please don't ever come here; it's a waste of time, money, and appetite.",

It felt odd sitting in them.We were approached twice to order and then took a long time to actually receive our orders. \u00a0Drinks came first. \u00a0I had a Turkish, dry white wine which wasn't bad. \u00a0However, the starter didn't turn up. \u00a0When the mains arrived I was given a seafood stew when I had ordered a salmon stew and it was kinda average. \u00a0But by this point I couldn't be bothered to point it out.Don't get me wrong, the staff are nice. \u00a0It's just the service is all over the place.We were then asked to move to accommodate a larger group and were offered free tea to compensate, which they ensured we took advantage of. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We had Baklava for dessert which was okay but didn't blow me away.So, pretty as the venue is and nice as the staff are, this is place is kinda meh.",

The food is more like a 3.5. We just had a few mezze plates so can't give a full review, but based on what we had, that's the rating I would give. There are so many amazing Mediterranean/Turkish restaurants in London, it's hard to give it more. The falafel was amazing. The borek was pretty good. The tzatziki, baba ghanoush and vine leaves were all average. The dessert has just been described by mr as heavenly. We had the apricots. It was 4 delicious little bites, but the cream in the middle of the plate tasted like squirty from a can. I mean I like squirty from a can, but it's an unusual choice to serve in a restaurant.",

We were staying nearby and asked the manager of our hostel what he felt would be a good place to go that would still be open, and a place that would not be too expensive.He asked us if we liked Turkish/Greek food. We said yes. He told us to walk a few blocks over to Troia.We arrived a little before closing but they were still willing to serve us. We sat outside on a breezy summer night.We decided to have the mixed Meze which came with 7 little plates(pretty much like tapas) Everything was delicious, especially the Hummus. The waiter even brought us more bread when we finished our first basket. My friend is half Arab and knows her food and she told me she would describe the food more along the lines of Lebanese than Greek or Turkish.Though they were closing in 10 minutes they asked us if we wanted any dessert or coffee(most places tend to rush a person when they are ready to close, but they were still eager to serve). Since we realised they were closing we didn't want to put them through any trouble, but they assured us it was okay, so \u00a0we ordered two coffees.Instead of our waiter bringing out the coffee, the owner did. He asked us how we liked the food and where we were from. He was a very nice guy. It means a lot when the owner takes interest in what his customers think. He told us to take our time and enjoy the coffee.When I visit London I will make it a point to visit here again. The service was above average and the food was delicious.",

    "text": "This place has potential, it's in a great location and the decor has a lovely, Arabian feel to it, but the place is a bit lacklustre mainly because of the service. When I called to make a reservation, they didn't really seem to register what I was saying and even though they had confirmed the reservation, they didn't seem to know I had made a reservation when I got to the place. Even though the waiters were polite, most of them seemed quite ingenuine. The food came fairly quickly and it was quite nice, but nothing special, so paying \u00a335 for two main dishes and a beer seemed quite steep for a mediocre service and standard food.",

    "text": "As another review stated, this place does have great decor and vibe; however, its service is extremely lacking. I went in with two friends hoping to kill some time before heading to our London Eye reservation for dinner but ended up waiting an hour for our food to still not arrive. During that time I noticed about half a dozen tables that have arrived before us still not being served. By the end of the hour we decided to just get our food for take away and come back for it after our London Eye reservation, which the waiter happily obliged to. After nearly an hour we come back to pick up our order and our food was apparently still not ready. We waited an extra 30min on top of the hour we waited initially and on top of the hour we went away to the London Eye! \u00a0The waiter felt sorry for us and gave us sodas but that still help the situation. The manager then brought out the food in plates when we asked for take away which was another annoyance. When the food was finally packed, we double checked the bag and they didn't even get our order correct-- giving us a pasta rather than the salad we ordered. Not only did we have to wait nearly three hours for our food, we had to wait three hours for the wrong food. All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant and would suggest walking a bit further from the tourist attractions to get a better dining experience.",

All ingredients were fresh and the dishes home made including the dessert we had. Our starters were the feta and peppers and the Hummus. Both were extremely tasty. The feta was smooth and creamy and the rocket salad it was over was very fresh. I had the Iskander platter which was the mixed grill kabob (lamb,chicken and ground lamb) with the bread and yoghurt. Flavors were amazing. My wife had the chicken shish kabob. Very moist and tender with good flavor. The dessert was a home made baklava. The nuts was finely chopped and it was just sweet enough. It was paired with vanilla Movenpick ice cream. \u00a0Large enough to split. All this for 58\u00a3 with the service. Really awesome.",

When I ate here, it happened to be my birthday and I met and spoke with the manager--who is simply an amazing man. As per usual, I got a complimentary birthday cake which was a very sweet gesture from the manager. We constantly complimented the servers on the food, and even asked for more of a spicy sauce that they had--and our service was very good and the staff treated us extremely well. The ambiance was a little casual romance whilst being dimly lit. It was very family friendly and my party liked it a lot. Having driven around Europe to many restaurants and even rest stops on the road, I have just accepted that most public bathrooms in Europe are weird. Europe is a very old place with a long history. Should they update their bathrooms? Surely. But they probably won't, so I'm not holding my breath.",

Seriously all of the other places in the same area ranged from 2-3.5 stars. Service was friendly and fairly attentive. It was Father's Day and the waiter was quick to wish me good tidings. I'm fairly sure it was the owner who also came by later to say hello and ask if we were enjoying our meal which we did.The food is really tasty. Portions could be a little larger for the price but definitely well prepared. I got the lamb skewers which were excellent. Good seasoning and juicy. One daughter had the chicken skewers and same deal. Both come with a simple salad and basmati rice. My other daughter ate a burger which was standard. My wife ordered the seafood stew which came with prawns and squid (she opted out of mussels) vegetables in a creamy tomato sauce which worked wonders with the rice. We also got calamari which was yummy but again would have loved just a bit more on the plate. The bread they served was phenomenal. If you're looking for a good bite in this area Troia is worth the check-in.",

I ordered the lamb moussaka and my boyfriend ordered the adana kebab, both of which we enjoyed very much. We ended our night with hookah outside. The owner came out and chatted with us and gave us flavor suggestions. The service here is on point- they checked in on us frequently without being overbearing. We were the last table of the night as they were closing up and they encouraged us to stay and enjoy the last of our hookah without feeling rushed. An awesome experience!",

The hostess is very animated and almost borderline \"crazy\" when trying to get customers into the door. It's very entertaining to watch. The prices are reasonable and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Noticed this restaurant near our hotel, and then read reviews on yelp so decided to try it. We were very pleasantly surprised how good it is, especially considering its proximity to the hoards of tourists a block away at the London Eye. There were five in our party, including a teen and a pre-teen. \u00a0The kids were both happy with the burger and fries on the menu (and there is a children's menu too). \u00a0The adults shared the Troia mixed grill, the chicken casserole, the carrot salad, and the tomato and avocado salad. Everything was delicious. The salads were about twice as large as we expected for a side salad, and very fresh with perfectly ripe avocados and a light tasty dressing. The lamb on the mixed grill was tender and well seasoned. The chicken casserole had a wonderful flavor too and we were offered a red chili paste to heat it up a bit. \u00a0The service was great - we only had 30 minutes to eat because we were trying to make a show, and the server helped us order dishes that could be prepared quickly and then made sure they got to the table fast. This restaurant is really more of a modest 4 star, but I added another star because of the unexpectedly delicious food and the helpful service.",
