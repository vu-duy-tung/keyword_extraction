The food is okay. The drinks could be more expensive. It basically feels like a very non-confrontational approach to being a pub: it is large, but cozy enough; you get what you expect from the food without being either wowed or disappointed; the beer is predictable, but it's still beer. Basically, nothing overwhelmingly fantastic or disappointing. I would go back, but I'm not yearning to. I'm not opposed to it, either. It's all very Goldilocks.",

The atmosphere here is great though, prices are ok, and the fact that they play shitty 90s music is amazing :) Plus with all the different tube lines it is also convenient, as everyone will find a way to get home.",

I was in London on business and main reason for visiting Waxy's was that they advertised an evening a live Irish session music, which always means that I will be there. The facility is huge, by my experience at least, and the subterranean feel makes it difficult to easily get around the place, but it was fun. Sitting down to enjoy the music I started up a conversation with the bartender and that was pleasant. My only negative issue is that the room was blazing hot - no idea why?

Frank Ennis, architect (who designed 'the Kerryman' in Chicago more recently), turned a massive space, into a church-like zoo, for over-grown children to get lost in. About 6/7 bars and nooks and crannies galore.The massive tree seemingly growing up from out of the middle of the main bar, giving it all the theatrics of a Peter Pan tale! I can barely remember 'Waxy' the opening Gm's name, but I think it was Neil, and he was dead sound, as was his cousin. Rayleen was a manager and Martin too, though we didnt get on till later back in Dublin. It was too busy for too much messing! ;) This pub was later used as a business model for bars across America e.g Fado Irish Pubs, and it was not long until it was the highest grossing bar in Britain (no wonder they opened another version down the road) So if youre going to export the craic (fun) from home, then this is the spot! This is how it's structured at least, but on a return there recently, the crowd still does the rest, whether Irish or not!Warning: It's not a spot you go on your own for a quiet pint from Thurs to Sun at least!",

To this day, I contest that Murphy's is better than Guinness. I get a lot of hate on this, but that's just cause most people haven't had the experience that is a pint of Murphy's Stout.From outside, this looks like any old quasi-Irish pub. When you get inside, it looks slightly bigger. But if you stay in the front, ground floor bar, you are missing what makes this place phenomenal. Towards the back there is an open labyrinth of seats, stairs, bars, and a giant TREE. This is no prop tree, this is the real thing, alive and functioning. It makes the place the greatness that it deserves to be. Pints are affordable, they have mixed drinks and a very tasty pub grub menu. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger with chips and it was one of the best, if not the best I've had in London. This place is hopping on most nights of the week, with a good amount of revelers on the weekends. My original concern was that it was so close to the tourist traps of Piccadilly, but once you get past the stink and filth of Piccadilly Circus, this place is just out of the way enough to make it a destination and not just a \"let's go here\" pub. They have an upstairs that overlooks a good part of the bar for private parties. Also, when there isn't a live band (Sundays feature an awesome Irish band), the juke box will be blasting mostly American rock, with the occassional Clash, Oasis and other Brit bands thrown in for measure. I will be back soon and often!",

Dotting up from Doha to Dunedin, these silly places are invariably called Hooligan's, play unending fiddle-dee-dee music and are staffed entirely by locals without two words of Irish to knock together nor the skill to leave a stout settle properly. Sampling Irish-ness (whatever that is) in one of these so-called Irish bars is sort of like expecting to realise some universal zen on the sushi conveyor at Yo! \u00a0 Rant finished, I grudgingly acknowledge that Waxy O'Connor's (yes, another silly name) is one of the better examples of globalised Oirish fakeness. The bouncers are surprisingly nice, the timber interior is atmospherically cavernous, the place is always rammed with real-life GAA-jersey wearing jackeens, and the Guinness is passable. It's not quite like being transported to a misty bog bar in Roscommon, but perhaps as close to the buzz of an after work Friday in Temple Bar or Rathmines as you'll find anywhere off the old sod.",

From the outside, it's just a couple of doors into a pub but if you go in there, it is MASSIVE & pretty cool!The interior is wooden and the theme is 'Church'. There are so many corners and cubby holes, chairs that are like church seats, areas that look like a confessional box! \u00a0balconies over looking the whole pub and signs pointing you in different directions in case you get lost! There is also a beautiful huge tree in the middle of the pub too!The bar is well stocked, the music is main stream and the crowd is a nice after work/ tourists/local crowd - good mix.There is another pub called 'Waxy's little sister'around the corner too.It gets really busy at the weekends so I recommend checking it out during the week!I've never had a crap time here, it's not COOL as such but it is alot of silly fun!

Interesting layout, reasonable drinks selection, but I am not a fan of the atmosphere and it either feels really cramped or really empty. Either way there's rarely anywhere to sit. There's also no mobile phone signal inside, making it hard to coordinate if you have friends arriving there to meet you. The tree is kind of cool though so it's worth going there just for that.",

Amazingly, it manages to repel the twunts that circle the rest of Leicester Sq and Picadilly.It can get very busy in here at the main bar but I recommend squirrelling yourself away upstairs for the more authentic experience.",

Has a great atmosphere although can get very busy, the main negative though is a slight bone of contention as we enjoyed my birthday here a year or so ago, we paid a fifty quid reservation deposit which was promised as to be returned as a bar tab but it was quite uncomfortable (paticularly for my bday) that when my husband asked to use the bar tab they seemed confused and reluctant to give us the bar tab wanting proof of payment? Eventually (be warned getting signal here is tricky) he managed to bring up the confirmation email prooving he had paid! So be aware if booking to take a printed email as the staff might not be told, overal a great place to hang tho!",

The interior is a melange of all sorts: Brick walls, wooden ceilings, a random array of wooden furniture.

    "text": "While cruising the streets of Soho on a Friday afternoon, a good friend and I started to discuss the matter of a good pub lunch. Our idea came to fruition in the form of Waxy O' Connors. The pub's meek entrance belies the true stature of the place: it magically opens up onto a stunning, warm, multi-level pub with intricate woodwork, old concrete floors and stained glass windows. It feels quite authentic in its oldness so you half expect someone to walk in wearing a full suit of armour. Seating was comfortable and the menu interesting, both of us settling for a smoked salmon sandwich and a cider. The food was excellent, though getting it proved to be slightly problematic. It's clear a lot of work and fine-tuning has helped create this pub and its almost biblical atmosphere, but what a pity the response to my food order from the person standing at the till was \"I'm on my break.\" Thankfully, good company in great surroundings proved to be the real winner at the end of the day.",

I really enjoyed it--I had a good night out with new city friends, and generally went home pleased with the place. But, I wasn't yet the active Yelper that I currently am, and I guess I never reviewed it!So here I am, six months later, after another fun night at Waxy's. This time I organized a big group to go there as part of a school-related event. I wasn't able to book a table, it being St. Patrick's day weekend, but it was the only bar I really considered going to, given it's huge space and ability to be Irish without offensive or overwhelming.We spent most of our time up in the \"upper back\" bar... I'm not sure which to call it. The main floor was quite full, with live music playing, but we were able to get a few tables, have a few drinks, and generally unwind from a long set of classes. The servers are always great here--getting drinks out fast and keeping the tables clean. There's never been a problem with the prices or anything like that, which is nice considering that it's in the heart of Piccadilly/Leicester Square and they could easily gouge on prices.I love this place because it's so big--you could sit in a different part of the building each night of the week. It gives it a funky, homey, pubby feel, despite being in \"tourist country,\" and so large. Definitely a fave in the area... probably the only bar/pub/club I like in Leicester Square, actually!",

Friendly staff ( if you're behaving yourself), often genuinely from the Emerald Isle.

A fiver for a Guinness is extortion, but that's London (and incidentally, still cheaper than in Dublin...).The pub is enormous, cavernous, and labyrinthine. There are tons of different floor levels, rooms, and nooks where you can hang out. And yes, there is a tree in the middle of the pub. Yesterday, every one of these spots was rammed and packed to the max, but I imagine it isn't always like this.The music was too loud and very Irish, ranging from The Pogues to The Script to fiddle and whistle folk songs. Not sure if that was also just a St. Paddy's day thing, but it made it so that you had to shout in order to speak to your friends who were standing less than a foot away from you.The bouncers in the club were essentially traffic control policemen, in that they barked at you if you stood in a walkway for more than 3 seconds. We had to plan where we were going before we went there, which was hard to do because we didn't know whether the destination would be more crowded than the place we were setting off from.The crowd was loud, rowdy, and very intoxicated. There were all kinds of invasions of personal space, lots of drunken jigging, and otherwise lots of...well...shenanigans. The above describes exactly the sort of bar I despise with a fiery passion. Yet, I had the most fun I've had in a long time at Waxy's. The insane crowd, overpriced drinks, and lack of any room to breathe all sort of worked for me. I guess everyone gets a free pass on St. Paddy's, though.",

I went on a Friday night and it was very busy to say the least, so to grab a table you need to get there really early, or be quick enough to grab one from people that are leaving. The atmosphere is great, although the music is very random (there may be a juke box somewhere) randomly you will hear an Irish song, and then you'll hear some random pop song! it is quite a strange experience and it can take you on an emotional roller coaster. They do serve food, but as it was so busy we only ordered chips, the chips were very nice :) It's in a great location so once you have finished here there are lots of other bars to move onto.

When we ordered food they just asked the general location of the restaurant that we were seating.They didn't take a name or number or anything, which felt strange to me. Surely the person at the bar taking my order would not be delivering my food? How would they know where to deliver it to?Sure enough, they brought our food to the wrong table. The other table apparently wasn't sure what they ordered, but started picking up our food and eating it anyway. It looked like our food, so I asked the waitress about it, and then they just picked up the plates and put them on our table. Thanks for serving us food touched and eaten by other customers.",

I think once upon a time it used to be a living addition to this world, but now, it's there for our viewing pleasure alone. If we were in Middle Earth, this scene would be so messed up! Having a dead body as a centre piece in a place of entertainment - Treebeard would be so p***ed! \u00a0Besides the dead Ent, you will also find old church pews, pole pulpits and retired confessional boxes (how apted!) Oh and did I mention it's an Irish pub?Years ago when I used to go here, it seemed so fresh & new, but perhaps it was I that was bright eyed and bushy tailed, and it had always been mediocre. That said, I am still very much attracted to this pub, even though I have to fight my way through hords of tourist to order my pint of extra cold.I would suggest that it's best avoided during the weekend, but if you must venture in, be prepared to queue at one of the many bars (I think there are three), even if you just pop in for a pre-lunchtime quickie!",

Fridays and Saturdays it's crowded w/ locals, as myself. At first look it may seem like a small place, but it is HUGE! You go downstairs, then you have this big hall, then you go upstairs - wow, a tree inside the pub! Pretty fantastic. Then downstairs again, wait, that's another room and another bar.. told you it was huge. Music is usually some oldies but goldies tunes. And when you're done looking around it's time to get a drink. A pear cider for me, thanks!",

Some of the songs weren't what you could say Irish and a bit poppy, but who cares, we were loving it. The beer obviously helped and the prices weren't too shabby for this! The only thing that was annoying was when the barmaid tried to get us to pay for a drink we never ordered. That could have put a dampener on the night, but once we simpered out the confusion, we put it behind us and started dancing! \u00a0It gets busy with reservations but maybe it was just because Christmas was around the corner and people wanted to have their work parties!

It's also big enough (there are three floors) that you don't get trampled on or don't spend your night waiting at the bar to order drinks. Having said that, there are loads of cosy little alcoves in this pub too so it's good for big and small groups.A round of drinks (wine, beers, cider) for four people came to \u00a314 in central London. Nuff said.This place is a great laugh and has the right balance of not pretentious, but not trashy - which is a hard feat in central London.

Without doubting his excuse, he said my friend was too drunk (she's been sober for 5 years) and refused an explanation. We were extremely disappointed at the lack of hospitality and honestly,humanity, that was executed at this bar. As we walked away, the bouncer mimicked a \"jacking off\" hand gesture over and over, calling us bitches and making us extremely uncomfortable. We will not be returning as we feel this is a reflection of not only the sick humans working the pub, but also the owners who allowed this disgusting behavior to happen.

I know I still have a lot of traveling to do and more places to find but this place... built around a tree has like 3... maybe 4 (I really don't remember) different bar areas to ensure you get the drinks you need quickly. Perhaps the word need isn't the right word.Everyone is happy dancing and singing and even being an American I was able to pick up on some of the choruses and sing along and always dance along. I love that they covered Metallica's Whiskey in the Jar O ;)We met dozens of people, such a friendly lot and everyone got along great. I can't think of what more you could want. Just joy at its core.THE VERDICT:If you only get to go to one bar while you are in London, I say go here. Friday, Saturday or Sunday night... doesn't matter any of those nights you will experience a fun loving crowd and be amazed by the tree that represents the roots that bring us all together for one remarkable night. Alex why a five-star... because it is freaking St. Paddy's day punk!",

Yes, a meat pie. \u00a0I've been wanting to try one of these forever, and I just never got around to it. Until now that is! \u00a0Service was great, and everyone here was very friendly. They also have a tree theme going on, as if a giant tree is growing into the bar. \u00a0It's pretty cool. \u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this place and would highly suggest seeking it out if you're looking for good food and drink within London.",

The place is really good looking and lots of cozy places to have a good time with friends or privacy with a date.My husband also had the chicken pie- which was to die for. Gravy, smash, seasonal veg (which was some kind of kale-like green).

It has this fantastically alive vibe, like the patrons should be wearing deerskin boots and have swords or bows strung across their back... Like there should be a bard in a corner, or a ranger near a fireplace. Imagine, if you will... a multi-story pub, with trees and vines interspersed throughout. And then some rooms open into others, other rooms have two or three steps that go up into alcoves; this place is to big that it even has several bars. But not all bars had people behind the counters. And the tables didn't have numbers... I think that was something you received once ordering food. I don't know, maybe they just didn't want to serve us? I went to order, and they asked me where I was sitting. I recited a particular land mark near our table, that I thought was unique to the room we were sitting in, only to have the bartender tell me that several rooms has the same marker. So I ended up giving up, because we were just supposed to stop by for a quick drink before going to the Palace to see The Cursed Child. And I even got lost trying to find my companion on the way back. I'm not joking. This place is like a maze, especially when it's crowded, and you're mind is a bit preoccupied. Many rooms look similar, and everything is in a semi-darkness. I don't even want to imagine how confusing it would be to navigate if you were actually drinking.I definitely want to come back here if I'm in the area for further exploration!",

    "text": "Waxy O Connor's is wonderfully deceptive from the outside. I popped in here for a drink on a Saturday afternoon thinking that it would be your average run of the mill pub. I was certainly in for a pleasant surprise! It reminds me a little of a magical make believe world - something out of Lord of the Rings perhaps as there is a huge tree in the middle with lots of different levels with little seating areas. It sounds sad but I wouldn't be surprised if I saw little goblins wandering around in here. OK - maybe I am sad. The ceilings are huge and I love the rustic wood furniture. It is always busy in here - in the afternoons you can usually find a cosy seat but on an evening, especially the weekend, you will struggle as it is always packed out. The music is brilliant - of course, you get your Irish favourites which are good fun and they then play classic 80's, rock and pop. The staff are brilliant - they work the bar well and are great fun yet efficient. You can also get a lovely pint of Beamish.",

The interior is fantastic, it resembles a rabbit warren with all the twists & turns and different floors & levels (it can be quite confusing when you have had a lemonade or two though!) The bar has big screen tvs & shows major sporting events. Drinks are priced similar to other central london establishments & closing time is 11.30. If you want to party on into the night, you will have to find another watering hole, but as waxy's is in such a central location, it wont take you long to find a late bar to continue partying",

There is ample seating space, however food is generally served at a separate seating area (the lowest floor) away from the main bars, which tend to become crowded as the night goes on and the music gets louder.

Good atmosphere overall, though it can get really quite busy and you're a braver man than me if you try and get in there on St Patrick's day.

I remember the first few times I was there being awestruck by the massiveness of the places with all the fantastic nooks and crannies, the really gorgeous big beautiful bar and that amazing beech tree right in the center of the establishment. It got crowded quickly in the evenings, but if you got there early enough you could find a seat, and the food they served was really very good. The music they played was all Irish and the atmosphere had a really good vibe. Now, or at least the last time I went to Waxy's, which was sometime in the last year or so, it feels more like a typical Leicester Square bar/nightclub. The music is more typical and LOUDER, the crowd feels more like they are there for a meat market than for a good hang-out and in general the place just feels like it's lost it's SOUL. There are even bathroom attendants, which is also typical of the area, but so ridiculously unnecessary! Why Waxy's have you forsaken me?! I used to love going here, thought of it as a treat, but now I can't even bring myself to step inside. What a shame.",

There are a few areas where a corridor or a few steps will lead you into a side area, and even one bit that takes you to a very compact balcony space overlooking one of the main bars. There's usually someone hording it thoughThe website has a 'virtual tour' to give you a flavour of the place. It does get very noisy and extremely crowded so don't walk in with a headache. Seating is at a premium and you need to be prepared to stand. You can get into the place from either side of the block: there is one entrance from Rupert Street and another one on Wardour Street. They're are not that easy to find, look for the overhead sign - a round one I think?",
