It's one of my favourite places for dim sum in London - I also love their koi pond and little arched bridge as you go in - delightfully cheesy, but they really do have some impressive koi in there! Once inside, the place is nicely appointed, with a lot of tables all covered in white linen, and nicely dressed staff who are very helpful and quick. It gets very popular at lunchtimes so I normally arrive there at about midday to avoid the rush at 12.30! For about a tenner a head you can make a real pig of yourself with dumplings, cheung fan, squid - you name it, they've got it! It's worth mentioning that their loos are also very nice.",

From the outside the Imperial China appears extremely small however after you've walked through the entrance from the street, over the small arched bridge and paused to look at the koi carp in the pond you will then be shocked by the actual size of the restaurant. Downstairs you have the main floor of the restaurant, upstairs you have 3 floors of karaoke rooms (8 in total) with a great seating area on the top floor. I would definitely recommend this venue, I'm a veggie and there were lots of options available with even more for my meat/seafood eating friends. I've never heard anyone complain about the food, the service is pretty good too and you definitely get value for money!",

Daytime dim sum was incredibly tasty with some excellent cheong fun (streamed noodle rolls) plus traditional steamed dumplings and steamed buns. However I visited it in the evening for the first time last week and wasn't disappointed. It's a haven of peace in busy chinatown. A pianist provides unobstrusive relaxing background music. There's no evening dim sum, but the dishes were all delicate, flavoursome and attractively presented. Surpisingly good value too. It can be a nightmare to find (and remember) a good chinese in Chinatown, but once you stumble upon the Imperial China, it's certainly one to re-visit.",

    "text": "I went to Imperial China on 9th May (Friday) for a business lunch along with five work colleagues. As the previous reviewer mentioned the restaurant is a little hard to find if you're not in the know. It's also decorated well and the water feature is pleasing. Although this was a business lunch we had time to do it properly and each of us ordered 2 dim-sum dishes each as well as whole duck and some noodles. Service was generally pretty quick and tea-refills were easy to get. However by the time we'd finished all the Dim-Sum (including some sweets) the duck had not arrived and it took another ten minutes after the table had been cleared. Possibly for this restaurant they don't think serving Dim-Sum and duck at the same time is a good idea, but it really pro-longed the lunch too much and after eating sweet dim-sum the duck was not quite that special anymore. Prices for lunch seem fine, although the duck at \u00a330 was not enough for six people and had too few pancakes with it! Dim-Sum is one of my favourite food types in the world and overall Imperial China is slightly above-average. Range is reasonable, taste is fine although unlike some restaurants there wasn't a special menu or any really 'different' dishes The most unique we had was tripe, (cow stomach) which on the menu actually said, NOT RECOMMENDED. That's the first time I've been to a restaurant that doesn't rate its' own food! Overall then, it was fine for lunch, but not quite as special for me as the previous reviewer.",

    "text": "Very lacklustre, lousy service The Imperial China stops serving dim sum after 5pm, and I would advise anyone not to visit after that time either. There is nothing wrong with the a la carte menu per se, but it is pricey, nothing special and the food was not more than okay, some of it having a taste and appearance of having made a detour from wok to plate to table. Especially the Dim Sum Sampler, which varied from piping hot to a very 'Here's some we made earlier'. Portions were also on the small side. But what puts the lid on the experience is the Imperial's attitude to service. Like so many establishments, there is a service charge of 12.5% Legally speaking, service is always discretionary and does not form part of the contract: you are under no obligation to pay it. To be fair, the Imperial uses the word 'Discretionary' on the menu and it is also flagged up on the bill. Last night, our 'discretionary' service charge was just over \u00a38. I have nothing against tipping, and on occasions have even tipped more. But I do object to restaurants making another grab into my pockets (especially when I wonder if the staff actually get it, and/or it's being used to avoid paying them a decent wage too). In which case, if an extra charge is being levied, then there should be more to just putting a dish on the table and walking away. I would like the staff to show some interest in the guests, to make me feel welcome. to keep an eye out, to ask (and with conviction) if everything is fine, and also not have to have me asking for bowls and several times for spoons, for example. So I did leave a tip, but not the hoped for \u00a38 because we didn't get 12.5%'s worth of service. The waitress took the money, went to the cash desk, had words with a manageress, came back and asked, \"Don't you want to pay the full price?\" Funnily enough, no, I didn't! And when I tried to tell her why, she quickly backed away and walked off. But then she could see I was thinking of how to get back what I had left! Clearly, the word 'discretionary' has another meaning in (the Imperial) China! But it should not include the staff being incited to debate the matter or try to embarrass the customer. Another trick to watch out for, which I have experienced on a previous occasion: when paying by credit card, the last line was left open, thus inviting me to pay a double dose of 'discretionary' service. Watch out for this.",

This restaurant is tucked away on a side street, and even the entrance looks quite hidden. However, inside they have loads of tables over two floors, and unlike many Chinese restaurants on Gerrard Street, there is plenty of room between tables. Service is prompt, and the menu is extensive and truly Chinese, but I have found that over 2 years the food quality has degraded somewhat, and I now consider it a tad expensive compared to other good Chinese places in London. Still, it is one of the rare few places in Chinatown where you can have a good meal in peaceful surroundings and not be chased from your table after half an hour. The price is slightly higher than the competition, but it is a good choice for a business meal or for some privacy.",

The pork dim sum (don't ask me for the Chinese name!) is really good. Its good quality food, in a nice environment - although I prefer coming here for lunch rather than dinner. Not just for the dim sum menu, but because there is so much natural light, it gives the impression of eating outdoors. Very nice.",

When our first dish arrived, the tea had still not made it to the table and we had to ask 3 times for it. Most Chinese restaurants run on efficiency and tea is the first thing to come out - this was not a stellar example. On top of that, the food was just ok. The beef cheung fun (one of my favorite dim sum dishes) lacked flavour and lacked beef. The glutinous rice in lotus leaf was also wrapped in tissue paper and was underwhelming. Everything else we had was fairly standard, no complaints but nothing great to say either. I think I'll stick with my usual Sunday dim sum haunts - Ding Hao or Young Cheng, much better food and service!",

Luckily, we did not partake in such traditions. We partook in bubbly and Chinese food. And karaoke. I'm surprised that none of the other reviews mention the karaoke rooms. Which is strangely in the same private rooms that you have dinner in. Not entirely strange, but when you've started singing and no one has cleared your tables, it's a bit unusual. Like doing karaoke in the kitchen or something. But the food is fantastic. I'm as shocked as anyone that there's a decent place to get Chinese food in China Town. There wasn't anything that we didn't enjoy. As always, there was enough pancakes for the duck (why don't they ever bring enough?) and the main courses were the real highlight. Especially the salt and pepper squid. There's nothing overly special about the food, we're not talking Yuatacha or anything. But it's better than anywhere I've eaten in the area. Our set meal was \u00a327.50 and that included karaoke for the evening too (I think we left around midnight, after killing every single song we could in three hours). We had many many bottles of sparkling wine too, yet somehow only spend \u00a340 each including service. Absolute BARGAIN. It would have been a bargain at \u00a360 a head too. Great night.

The cheung fun, thick rice noodle wrap, came a little too thick and chewy, but that was the only dish which was a mild disappointment.

To me there is no better comfort food than in the form of Dim Sum. My beloved and I went there and I felt like there was a food god once more that could offer reasonably affordable food that was of decent quality and very, very moreish. We had some Har Gau, Siu Mai and some prawn and scallop dumplings, all of which had a good meat content and wasn't greasy or flabby in the mouth. The chilli oil there is especially nice. We also had some steamed pork buns, mooli rolls and some cuttlefish cakes. Everything was well cooked, simply presented but tasted fantastic. We also shared a mango pudding for dessert and that was shaped like a carp and came with some sweetened condensed milk. It was simple but lovely. The dim sum mostly came in sets of 4 so that is great if you want to share within two of you, but I could have easily eaten everything we had twice as it was that good and given a bad meal i had the night before that I left most of I was one hungry beast. I shall definitely be returning, the food was lovely, staff attentive, prices reasonable and I loved where the restaurant was situated. I also loved that there is a little bridge you walk over before you enter that is full of carp fishes of different shapes, sizes and colours.",

We walked around Chinatown for half an hour trying to decide where to grub (it took a while since we didn't know shops didn't open till Noon). We finally settled on Imperial China as there was a good amount of people inside, which is always a good sign.From the outside the place looks pretty small, but once you walk in it's a completely different story. There's a pond with a footbridge which is just amazing. There's also plenty of tables and even a a couple of banquet rooms. The dim sum menu is pretty extensive which put a smile on my face. The only problem I had, was figuring out what some of the items were. I'm used to the American dim sum experience where they push the carts around and I get to point at what I like, so trying to figure out what some things were was pretty difficult. There was an added degree of difficulty with the language as well. I speak mandarin and the menu was written in the phonetic cantonese, so I definitely had a 'Lost In Translation' moment.The staff was really helpful when I was struggling with the menu. I was able to ask them in Mandarin, so that problem came and went. The price was in your typical dim sum range so no stress there. Definitely had a great time stuffing my face! I will definitely come back for dim sum when I visit in December! Yum!",

    "text": "I like Ping Pong, honest I do. It's just that, well, it's not the most authentic of experiences, is it? I know that sounds snobbish and foodie and all that malarkey, but why let a chain serve you dim sum when there are so many options in Chinatown? Actually, I know the answer to that: you know where you stand with Ping Pong and that you won't point to the wrong thing and get a plate of deep fried things that come from the, er, south end of a chicken. Plus, there are a lot of bad restaurants in Chinatown and wheedling the wheat from the chaff in this stretch of town is a project that would cost a fortune and take a month or two to complete. Happily, I lucked into Imperial China thanks to a friend's research and a cracking and filling dim sum lunch - with tea - was both delicious and excellent value: we were stuffed at less than 15 quid a head. Service is friendly enough but a little rushed. As we were on a limited time scale that suited us, but it would be interested to see how those looking for lingering grazing experience would find it. Mind you, at these prices, for food this decent, you can't really complain. Oh, and the Koi pond is really cute too.",

I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the menu downstairs that said \"some of the dishes below many not be suitable for western palates\" in the middle of the first column. This was repeated in the second column, but here the line started \"some of the dishes above...\" So anywhere your eye hit the menu, you'd be alerted to the fact that the chef knows how to make authentic dishes.When we were seated upstairs and read the menu, none of the dishes in the \"some of\" columns were listed, gasp! Instead, I was staring at a sea of westernized dishes, my eyes nearly welling with tears. My parents waved the waiter over to inquire about the dishes that had whet our appetites downstairs. They are all available so be sure to ask about the \"secret\" menu, which is in English and Chinese. The prawns in salted duck yolk were delicious, as was the choy sum simmered with mung bean thread and pickled vegetables. They also did a spot-on version of \"pipa\" tofu, not greasy or cornstarch-y as some can be. I'll definitely be back for dim sum one day!",

The \"complimentary service charge has been added to your bill\"-thing costs them one star.

Not my thing:I liked the steamed glutinous rice with wrapped in yam (2.50) although some may find it a little bland.Shredded chicken spring rolls didn't like the sauce that muchBlack sesame buns very greasyyum dumplings (rabbit) just too sweet for a main dishThe spicy soup was not all that nice either",

Initially, there were about 12 of us who were going to go, and when we got there, there were two people by the same name who had reserved tables for 12. Anyway, the crowd got bigger and bigger and bigger, and we were moved higher and higher and higher up the restaurant until we got to this cosy little private room on the 3rd floor where we could eat and chat to our hearts content. The decor is much like a nice chinese restaurant you would find in Hong Kong or Singapore. It's not posh like Royal China's is, but nice. We order about 200 types of Dim Sum (more like 30, but when you have that many people it sure seems like 200), and it consists of the usual har gow, siew mai and cheung fun, and a few other types of chive dumplings and the like. Most of it was... well, about right, not poor, but not great either. The glutenous rice with chicken and a wasabi flavored dumpling were the best things there, but the filling of the cheung fun, and the siew mais were the greatest disappointment. The filling for the cheung fun was, well, meagre, and the siew mais came, well, a little dried out. Most of the steamed foods were good, but it seemed like the baked items and the fried items were of a better standard.I think if I were bringing 17 people to Dim Sum at around \u00a315 a head, I'd go back to Royal China on Baker Street. I'm just glad this place wasn't like most in Chinatown where they rush to toss you out when you're done. :)",

Better yet, we managed to have a huge celebration meal with ten people, and only paid \u00a330 per head (without drinks).

    "text": "It's not the cheapest option but it ended up being a good last minute default. They do pretty reasonable dim sum too (not to my mind anywhere as good as Yauacha, or as cheap and joyful as New World or Dragon Castle), and their meats have always done the job (without filling my soul with any real joy). It's a big old place, a little prettier than some of its near neighbours and accessed over a tiny bridge past a concrete carp pool, just for a welcoming touch of clarse...I think as I've been eating a fairly substantial amount of Chinese cuisine recently, my palate has improved slightly. There's some disingenuity as to what counts as 'true' Peking Duck. My belief has always been that this is what you get when the bird has been cooked, marinaded and airdried (as you'll often see in Chinatown windows). With the skin separated from the rendered fat and crisped up to a shiny, dark, plum coloured top sheet, it's eaten first with a dipping sauce before the remaining sliced meat is wrapped in tiny pancakes with onion and plum sauce. I'd contrast that with aromatic crispy duck (the type you tend to get in most Chinese takeaways) which tends to give you an oven cooked duck where meat, fat and skin are broken up roughly with forks and served together in those pancakes. No garlic dipping sauce for the skin as you sometimes get with Peking Duck, just packaged pancakes and the usual hoisin, but I was impressed by the duck itself, with its soft fatty flesh perfect underneath shards of crisped marinaded skin.Of the other dishes, shared BBQ pork was a touch too sweet and so juicy as to feel faked, crispy beef was similarly sweet, albeit with a good chilli kick, but neither would bring me back. There were some perfectly acceptable noodles and an excellent aubergine hotpot that probably would bring me here again though.With a couple of beers and a few starters, we were looking at \u00a335 a head. Not bad for what we'd had, but you can do cheaper and better round here.",

Impeccably fast and efficient service, lovely food - particularly enjoyed the Taiwanese-style spicy chicken which, although not at all spicy, was absolutely delicious. Cannot fathom the size of the koi carp in the tiny stream and felt kind of bad for them but aside from that, the atmosphere and great food made it definitely worth another visit.

So color me impressed by Imperial China, a slightly upscale place around the corner from the Prince Charles.While nothing we ordered was mind-blowing, all dishes were well-prepared and tasty. I'd put it a definite cut above most of the meals I've had in the neighborhood. The highlight was probably the dim sum- it was amongst the best I've had since moving to London. I would definitely like to eat at this place again.",

However the service was appalling. 30+ minutes for our last course & had to ask for the bill before it finally came. Also, had to ask 3+ times for effing water. No one ever asked if everything was alright, if we needed a drinks refill and so on. Chinese couple sitting near us had the same experience but had the intelligence to leave after only a couple rounds of dim sum. Won't return.",

They had cheesy lanterns hung everywhere and we saw they had been Michelin rated so we popped in. Did the family meal for two which included crispy duck, and about five other dishes to share, all of them good. The service was on point and the duck with plum sauce was the star of the meal. Recommend if you're in the area, but wouldn't travel for it",

We went to the bar to have a beer while waiting and I think that displeased the manager and we had to wait for much longer while other groups came in and were immediately seated. When we were finally seated, we were seated up on the 3rd floor in a small room far away from everyone. There was no music and it was dead quiet other than our neighboring table's conversation. We were seated for probably 15 minutes before any staff even paid any attention to us and in fact the waitresses seemed to be avoiding eye contact with us when we tried to be proactive. This has 2 stars because despite the abysmal service, the food was quite good and came quickly. We got the seafood chow mein, kung pow chicken, the dim sum platter, and the chicken satay skewers. Everything other than the dim sum was delicious- I would say skip the dim sum, it was unmemorable besides the fact that it seems like the filling was just stir fry leftovers.",

You can tell they know good dimsum, the wrapper/skin was soft and not overly chewy, the stuffing allowed you to taste the ingredients..shrimp, chives, pork, and the spicy dipping oil complemented and boosted the flavors!2) Fried noodle with seafood with Ber..(can't recall the word) - greasy but so satisfying and tasty3) Chinese broccoli - garlicky savory goodness 4) Pot of Jasmine tea (pay for each person drinking it, free refills)Would love to come for their Sunday morning dimsum service!",

Your standard dim sum menu but there were items you had to order from the main menu which would drive up the price. For example there were no vegetables for under \u00a38, only vegetable dumplings.The food was good. Crispy sesame prawn rolls, pork dumplings, prawn and chives, and fried squid were all cooked to order. The long noodle with prawns came in its signature soy sauce but they failed to cut it in the middle which lended to a struggle with chopsticks.Little touches like soy sauce and chili oil at the table were missing and took several attempts to get staff attention to receive. Service was lacking even when we were ready to pay the bill. With three levels, you won't wait long and have your choice of dishes. However you can find many other places with a better overall value. Also note that they do not have cart/trolley service, only cooked to order.",

They have a constant flow but it is better to secure a table before you visit. Ahh!!! I love dim sums. If I can I would like to visit this place just for dumplings. So yummy... So fresh... Good quality! I was told that they have a separate dim sum menu which is available before 5 pm. Crispy duck was average. Chicken; sweet & sour,lemon was bit dry,was not the best.

Went with a group of 9 people, and by the end we were all pleasantly full, with only a few people having to \"take one for the team\" to finish off some last pieces. The variety is good, with all the standard favorites. Nothing was bad.The standout ones that I would definitely over more of are the prawn and chive dumplings and the baked pork pastries (char siu sou). We also got the cheung fun with prawn and char siu, char siu bau, har gau, taro croquette, and sliced fish congee. For the sweets, which were very good, we got the egg custard tarts and the black sesame buns, which were huge, easily splittable. Off the regular menu, we also got the soft shell crab appetizer, which was good, but not the best I've had. They had chrysanthemum tea, and it was just a very relaxing experience, which is practically unheard of for Chinatown. The waitstaff spoke good English, and service was impeccable--they cleared dishes promptly, and even checked the teapot levels proactively.There's one caveat, which is that the food comes out really quickly, so I think the food is all preprepared and ready to go. This was most evident in the fish congee, where the fish seemed precooked, rather than raw with the hot porridge poured over it to cook it, which is preferable.All told, it was less than \u00a313 per person, including service charge, which is very affordable, especially for the atmosphere and service. We had a booking, but the place was surprisingly quiet for a Sunday lunch. Maybe the weather was too good, and everyone was spending time reading a novel in a park.",

    "text": "I've been brought here on multiple occasions by friends and have had amazing food each time. It is really best for groups so you can share dishes and try lots of different things. I would definitely recommend the shrimp dumplings dim sum but I think every dish is delicious and true to it's name. We have never ordered something that turned out to be very different i.e. not crispy, not large enough, too much fruit/veg rather than meat. I was very surprised at some of the previous reviews (save for the review by Sarah T. just below mine) as I've always experienced wonderful food and wonderful service when I come here but perhaps they have improved in the last couple of years. I particularly want to highlight the staff who are so patient. They were very nice to my friends who aren't used to dim sum and very helpful when we asked about various ingredients. They have also been respectful about my slight fish allergy. I prefer this restaurant over all the others in Chinatown. It may be a bit more expensive but it's worth it.",
