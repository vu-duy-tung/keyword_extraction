It is everything you would expect from fine dinning but they always get a fee things wrong - the service staffs are nice but not that well trained so it is not flawless.., service can be slow and it certainly does not have that extra mile in service that surprise you... Food is okay - it is good but never amazing..., I remember my souffl\u00e9 was like half cake/half souffl\u00e9... You can not make such hard souffl\u00e9 and call it souffl\u00e9... And it was very big for tasting menu. I reckoned it was so hard so operations reason as it is much harder to sink if souffl\u00e9 is so stiff... Overall, I would not go back but I would encourage you to try yourself as apparently many like it.",

My recollection of the 9 dishes is as follows (apologies for the varying descriptions of each, I forget one or two):1. Smoked Venison Carpaccio with Wild Mushrooms. \u00a0Simply exquisite. A small portion with elegant presentation within a ceramic egg (think a small white Fabrege). \u00a0Suttle yet poignant.2. King Crab Lasagna. \u00a0A wonderful foam and a subtle taste of fresh made pasta, with a tasty chunk of crab.3. Crayfish with a truffle and celeriac base. \u00a04. Salted Fois Gras with mango reduction, a berry chutney and quince sauce. Nice salt sweet combination. 5. Cod6. Grouse 7. English Cheeses8. Cheesecake with Lime Sorbet9. Banana Souffle with Rum/Rasin Ice CreamThe bottom line, a WONDERFUL dining experience. \u00a0Do not be fooled by the initial portions of the 1st two dishes. \u00a0Unless you are a professional rugby player you will be satisfied by the end. \u00a0Presentation is simple yet elegant. \u00a0The staff is attentive, well trained, and friendly.

If I have to find any criticism at all, it is simply the decor is cold and lacking in feeling. The service and the food present no minor assault on the senses though, so it is somewhat a relief to have the ambience offer a foil. Incredible food.

It is easily an equal to Gordon Ramsey at Royal Hospital Road and in my view ahead of the tiered Le Gavroche and the hard sell of Petrus. Therefore i feel that along with Pied a Terre The Square is overdue for elevation to 3 stars. On my most recent meal the Lasagne of Crab with Langoustine cappucino and basil followed by Ayreshire Aged Beef Fillet wit croustiliant of x tongue , bone marrow , foie gras and girolles were stunng and beautifully executed. The amuse guelle was an insense gaspacho with two miniscule fried kalamari on the side - certainly woke up my taste buds. A half bottle of St Aubin followed by a 2002 Henri Boilott Volnay 1er Cru Les Cervets accompaied what was one of the best meals I have enjoyed in London for a long while. The service was what you would expect of such a professional establishment. My congratulations to Philip Howard and his front of house team - I hope they receive their just rewards soon !",

I can't remember what my husband had but everything was amazing. \u00a0The cheese cart is the best cheese selection I have seen...including in France. \u00a0The restaurant welcomes their guests with a glass of champagne, and appetizers. The Square is expensive but worth every penny (pence)....I can't believe I am saying this but the food and the service at The Square was a bargain at $400 US for 2 people ( which included couple glasses of wine and espresso and tea). \u00a0A 12.5% service charge is added, I would have added 20% or even more!!This really is a special restaurant!Reservation is a MUST!",

    "text": "[Non-Photo Review] For full review go to: wp.me/pwXBH-nE \u00a0---------- The Square: Generous, Rich, Golden Meeting the older sister Having had a pleasant (though not perfect) time at The Sqaure's little sister in Westbourne Grove a few months ago \u00a0for full review of that dinner see here \u00a0we were very excited to try out what is one of the most established stalwarts on the London fine dining scene. From what I know about The Square, it is undoubtedly one of the most consistently well regarded high-end restaurants in London, both by mainstream media food critics and food bloggers alike. Chef Philip Howard has certainly garnered a lot of respect and praise from his fellow chefs and food commentators of all sorts. This would appear to be partly because he is to some extent self-taught (though according to their website he did have a stint in the Dordogne, a year with Roux Restaurants Ltd. and a year at the now (in)famous Harveys where he had the opportunity to work with Marco Pierre White and no doubt learned that mother nature is the true artist \u00a0that chef's favorite modern day refrain \u00a0in-between having frying pans thrown at him), and partly because he is one of the few head chefs performing at this level to actually be present and cooking in his own kitchen pretty much day in and day out. As a short aside, I recently saw quite an interesting video interview with him on Caterersearch, but generally speaking he eschews the media and tries to keep to himself to the extent possible. So, an interesting character in the driving seat and certainly a serious contender for a very promising meal. My taste buds were certainly on high alert. Business or pleasure? Occupying the ground floor of a Mayfair office block, the entrance to The Square is rather nondescript, with a subtle sign somewhat camouflaged in the slightly curved burnt orange wall to the left of the front door. The line of windows facing the street is frosted to just above eye level, so you have to jump up to see into the restaurant, unless you're really tall. Once inside, this is an effective shield to the outside world, as when you are seated you can mainly see from the first floor upward of the buildings across the street, and not the street and pedestrian traffic. We were efficiently welcomed and shown to our table, which was at the back left corner of the wellsquare room, right next to where all of the food was being brought out from the kitchen. Not usually the best spot as it can be quite busy, but it turned out to be fine and afforded us a commanding view of the room and also enabled us to overhear the chit-chat of the staff. Compared to The Ledbury, whose interior Mrs. LF and I both found really appealing, The Square's ambience was a bit of a letdown. The tables are very well spread out, which provides you with good privacy and it isn't too noisy. But it is quite a plain room that for me lacks an engaging identity or design theme. It seems much more a business lunch on the company's expense place than somewhere you'd want to come for a romantic evening or a celebratory gathering. At first impression, the waiting staff were also all business. There seemed to be a small army of them coming and going from our little corner. They all conveyed a very professional air but, at the same time, they all felt quite distant and reserved in their interactions with us. It wasn't really a warm, inviting beginning. Not that this is a disaster, but quite the opposite of what we had experienced at The Ledbury. These factors were compounded by the fact that, as we were perusing the menu and trying to make our choices, our first amuse bouche was brought out. Then, shortly thereafter, a second round of amuses (of which there were three elements) followed. The Square's menu is quite a large affair, and it was rather awkward to find a place for them amongst all the little nibbles and bread which looked so appetizing. I got a bit flustered by the whole episode, and would have much rather preferred having them take our orders first and then properly beginning the meal. It just meant that we felt rushed and weren't able to concentrate on the food as much as we would have wanted to. While this is a small thing, and I probably wouldn't comment on it if the restaurant did not hold two heavy Michelin stars, it wasn't an impressive start. Since there was no time limitation on the table that I was aware of, I just didn't get why they were in such a hurry. Are you gonna finish that? But enough of my quibbles and onto the food. And boy was there a lot of it. Even though we had opted for the standard \u00e0 la carte 3-course menu, we quickly found out that it was to be more of a 7-course evening when taking into account all of the little extras that The Square very generously includes in all of its dinners. It also turned out that the portions at The Square are much larger than you get at any other restaurant of a similar ilk (at least the ones I've been to) and that the food was",

We received multiple amuse-bouche. The four course lunch tasting menu is great. The crab souffl\u00e9 is one of the most beautiful presentations of food I have ever seen. \u00a0And it was light and spicy. Love it. The sugar spiced foie gras was out of this world so very perfect. \u00a0The lamb was perfectly cooked. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 with chai ice cream was a perfect ending. Somehow light and rich at the same time. I keep saying perfect because that is the only word for what is happening here.

We opted for the tasting menu for \u00a3120pp which had nine courses. There is another three course option for \u00a390. We found a good rose for \u00a335 and there are many wines below \u00a360-70. The courses were playful enough without going overboard. The lasagne of Dorset crab with cappucino of shellfish and champagne foam was really very well done. It can be very hard to do this type of dish well - balancing all the fishy and salty flavors. The monkfish was good too, although they could have added more of a twist to it - perhaps some zing (but then again the restaurant is French). The duck was formal and well done, but a bit rare for my personal taste. Instead of the usual dependence on foei gras (so common in French restaurants), they could experiment a bit more. But these are just my musings - frankly there was nothing I could find fault with.The restaurant and chef deserve their Michelin stars. Very enjoyable restaurant.",

    "text": "Modern French cooking, what more can you ask for? While The Ledbury is slightly experimental, Phil Howard has kept his food simple with classic combinations. The dining room is a bit uninviting and stiff with modern decor - very formal setting and diners were generally business people and very well-dressed locals (the restaurant is right off Old Bond Street after all). Warm selection of bread, yum. Always a plus. The amuse bouche of pea soup with cod croquette was very refreshing. The starter of warm spring chicken salad is a classic but expertly prepared. The chicken was very moist, and not at all overcooked. Mains were fillet of brill with scallops, and a 2nd dish of fillet/raviolo of oxtail/slices of ox tongue. The fish was so so so good - crispy skin and it just flaked perfectly. The meat dish was amazing - medium rare steak, really juicy and the other meats were very flavourful. The vegetable accompaniment soaked up the sauces from the dish and balanced it out perfectly. For dessert, we went for chocolate fondant and the lemon tart with lime ice-cream. The lemon tart was very refreshing (a perfect end to a heavy meal). But the chocolate fondant...so rich, but so satisfying. They even pour chocolate sauce on top of the fondant - complete indulgence. Excellent French-inspired cuisine with great use of seasonal ingredients. Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for innovative combinations or strange pairings! Nonetheless, one of my favourites in London for brilliant food.",

The deserts and inter-course-bite food was actually the best thing that went into my mouth here.To say the place is apparently the 7th best restaurant in the UK, and has 2 michelin stars I was severely unimpressed by everything except the service - and particularly the sommelier who was nothing short of god-like in his knowledge of vino - and as such I'd not recommend to anyone.

That being said, this is my honest review.Food and service are both unacceptable. There was one good thing and I put it at the end. Of the 9-10 dishes we had, we could only completely finish 2 of them. I wish I was exaggerating. The food overall was beautiful but incredibly disappointing. The dessert felt like a sugar bomb went off in my mouth. We couldn't finish it. The service was just as disappointing and uncomfortable as well. I understand the idea of being there for every moment the customer could have a need but it's way too much. For example, the butter comes in these plastic wrappers... When you open one and place it on the table, within 15-20 seconds someone comes to clean up the wrapper. While this may sound nice, imagine your entire meal, someone is watching you from about 10 feet away and every single little thing you finish is removed. It makes eating very uncomfortable. Maybe others find this good but we were disrupted 4 times just with the bread course! They try to be quick but we're not rude people. We say thank you anytime someone helps but this made conversations about the service rather than enjoying being together.So, the one good thing? I think it was the manager. He was amazing. We mentioned how disappointed we were with the meal and service. I'm sure he noticed we weren't finishing the vast majority of the dishes. He discounted the meal for us which was very nice. Sadly, I would not recommend Square to anyone until the fix the many service issues and make the food tastes better.",

Because after you've eaten at The Square, whatever type of meat/seafood you ate there will forever make you a snob. That's right, I can not eat rabbit anywhere else now, because they rocked my world.The restaurant atmosphere is sophisticated and very formal. There's a dress code in place, and eating was a little stiff. This isn't the type of place that would welcome walk-ins. The starter bread was delicious, as they come around with a selection for you to chose. The appetizers were delightful and beautifully arranged, and light enough that you wouldn't worry about filling up fast.Then you have your main course. This place is michelin rated for a reason. The balance of flavors was wonderful, they give you just enough to satisfy, but not enough to gorge yourself on.And then the dessert was a light touching after. Perfectly balanced. Go, dress up, eat, and enjoy. You don't eat a meal like this every day, it's something to be savored and really a pleasure to have dined here.Also, even though I'm not big on wine. The list was superb.",
