    "text": "It is not the type of place you would normally find me on a Saturday night but there I was last night enjoying a couple of pints. It is very big generic wetherspoon type establishment on the Charing X road. It is not easily missed and the name is clearly signposted. There was a door-man in attendance and my bag was checked and I was not allowed to take my bottle of water in. The person I was with was made to take his hat off as well. Walking in, I could see that it was fairly busy and quite buzzy. There is a bar to the left of the floor and further to the back there is a Lloyds bar section with seating for dining but you could also sit anywhere else and order food from the bar I think. There are two large screens and both were playing standard pop music videos. There is also an upper floor with more seatings and the toilets are also upstairs. Upon walking to the bar I could see leffe in the fridge and wherever there is leffe there is bound to be fruli! There were a wide selection of beer on tap and lots of other choices of drinks including cocktails. The prices very very cheap for that part of town (a pint of fruli and one of Kronneburg came to \u00a36.50). All in all not a bad place to spend an hour or so and not as soulless as one would imagine.",

The bell rang for last call and suddenly 3 men in fluorescent vests were there to usher us out of the back half of the pub. Not kindly, either. \"This area is now closed. You need to leave.\" \u00a0No 5 minute warning. No politeness at all. So we begin to gather up our coats and scarves and bags and the one guy gets in our face \"You need to LEAVE NOW! I already told you!\" \u00a0- to which I not-so-nicely replied to him to \"calm the f* down - we're just getting our things.\" He was taken aback at my equal response to his nastiness and a few in our party all said that we were just getting our coats on, etc. He then said that we had 15 minutes til the pub closed, but that this area was closed right now and he didn't mean to imply that we had to actually leave the premises. \u00a0Sure, dude. You were all sunshine and roses...ugh.I fully understand the need to have people clearing out sections of an establishment toward the end of the night. But harassing jerks do not need to be in the mix of employees doing that job. Not impressed.",

BOO. we settled for a bottle of new zealand sauvignon blanc and it was really great, and well priced at \u00a316 a bottle. probably the best deal in the area.i know i'll return here. it has location, seats, and good prices. i'm sold (& this particular wetherspoons even plays music, which is nice).",

It is cheap, hearty fare whose quality rarely fluctuates. Since changing to a Lloyds No.1, the introduction of music and one of London's biggest screens for sport has transformed this bar.The place comes alive when sport is on and there is enough standing room and dining tables to keep everyone happy.My favourite time is mid afternoon where there is a quieter vibe and I can relax away from the bustle of Central London.",

    "text": "As one would expect from a Wetherspoon's pub The Montagu Pyke is large, impersonal and cheap. Especially considering it's Central London location this pub is huge. The Soho entrance leads on to \u00a0a smaller side bar and seating area, whilst the Charing Cross entrance leads directly into the large main seating area and bar. The decor isn't very exciting, but they have taken some care with it and consequently the place feels rather smart and modern.It is the sort of place I seem to go when meeting out-of-towners, though last weekend I went with an all London crowd. The drinks are cheap and there is a large and at least servicable selection (in summer the pear Koppaberg cider is a a reason to go). The corwd is fairly mixed during the day. At night it is largely revellers drinking before going to one of the Central London clubs. As the main attraction is the prices there is nothing that particularly defines the crowd apart from, perhaps, a lack of means. The clientele coupled with the decor gives the place a lack of atmosphere.It is not a bad place just incredibly average.",

Its vast size alone is something worth noting, because with live music and a late license you'd could easily find yourself having fun and dancing without having to pay stupid amounts of money to get in.With a typical pub selection of drinks, and decent bar staff the montague pyke, ultimately only a pub, offers a more enjoyable experience than most other pubs, especially if you are in a group of friends, it is a great place to start the night off and most people do before going onto \"Club 49\" just opposite. However for those too young to get into selected clubs it's a great place to be on the weekend until you reach legal age.Th major players in here are the men in suits, and also the fair few youngsters that come in from China town after playing arcade games on the weekdend.This fancy pub which has two entrances on either end, one opening on Greek st and the other on Charringcross rd, is a great place and a lot of fun. I'm definately a fan.",

It's a typical Wetherspoons to be honest - you know what you're going to get. It's huge and does lack a bit of atmosphere to be honest. Two bars in the one pub does means you can get served quicker though. The service was really helpful, Old Rosie was on tap, it's cheap and cheerful, it has wifi when I desperately needed it, and they claim to have the biggest screen to watch sport in the West End. As a Wetherspoons/Lloyd's No.1 it also means it has a good range of real ale and has even cheaper prices for wine until 8 June 2008. The food was good too, just what I need at this precise moment.

The more I drank, the more I saved if that makes sense!!!For example, to this day, weatherspoons offers a number of deals:The Monday club offers a number of drinks on special promotion, Tue night is steak night (around \u00a35-6 with a drink included) and my personal favorite is CURRY NIGHT on Thu (\u00a35.30 max per person).

Decor is fairly cinema themed, especially in the centralw auditorium area, with tv's dotted around and at least 1 big screen / projector setup. Usually they are showing a news channel, but I have seen them showing football sometimes. Food is std Wetherspoons fare, with the usual themed 'club' nights, and is pretty good (Wetherspoons food does vary dramatically between pubs) and inexpensive. Overall I'd rate it as a good pub to meet up in as its big with plenty of tables. If you prefer somewhere for a quiet chat then maybe not as the background chatter can be quite loud as it echoes around, but it is bearable.",

The place was lively and looked popular with both locals and tourist. There is no hostess, you just grab any available seat and the go to the bar to order both drinks and food. We ordered the chicken burger, aka a chicken sandwich.... don't order the chicken sandwich, it was tasteless and something you eat when your drunk and don't care about taste. Needles to say, I wasn't drunk. The drinks are ok, but I had to order a double gin and tonic to get it to the strength I'm used to in the states. My friend ordered a pint of beer, which was what most were drinking.All in all it was just OK. Didn't hate it, didn't love it.",

Took ages to order and obviously no place to sit. It is fine, let's have one drink and leave. The staff at the bar was rude and impolite. And that is a big 'NO NO' for me.

There's also a little gallery at the top overlooking the pub, which is quite nice.

All meals but one came out. That meal never arrived. When asked, the bar staff insisted the meal was served. The \"manager\" went as far as to say he checked the surveillance camera to prove it was served (though he would not show us said evidence). He proceeded to call us liars in a loud enough voice, one might say he was yelling at us... \u00a0 I say \"manager\" because he told us his manager refused to refund us. When we asked about his being the manager, \u00a0he stumbled... \"er, I mean, I won't take it off the tab...\" \u00a0 Awful. \u00a0Never again.",

I haven't had any of the food, but it's inexpensive as well and has the calories listed on the menu.Oh, and ladies, either go to the toilet when you get there or don't \"break the seal\" because the toilets seem to be located in the next postcode up 100 stairs.

It's nicely placed in central London and still avoids the anxiety-inducing prices that the area is known for. Also there's a ton of room, so you're almost always guaranteed to find a place to sit. The service is decently friendly and the food also succeeds at hitting the spot. Probably cus you'll already be a bit buzzed anyways.I don't really get the hate on Wetherspoons. From my experience it's quite sufficient in delivering the mediocrity but decent prices it promises.

A friend and I came here on a busy night and the place was packed. We scored a table and began to order their \"Christmas Special\" dinner that was advertised on their table menus. The bartender told us that they have \"delayed\" the deal and were not offering the deal until next week. The deal states it would be available from mid November to mid December....this is a big problem because if they aren't offering the deal, they need to most definitely remove those mini table menus immediately and even offer some type of voucher as compensation for the inconvenience and FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. I was very distraught about this situation because they didn't seem to be at all concerned that they were still displaying the deal even if it was entirely ineffective for order.The bar-staff was busy but not THAT busy to act like total pricks. They were emotionless and careless. They didn't give half a shit for their customers...I stood there for 25 minutes trying to place my order and they were helping people out of order. The woman that helped me almost refused to substitute my side salad for mashed potatoes and she walked nearly across the entire restaurant to ask if it were okay. Ridiculous. Foul service and shameful.Also, it was very embarrassing that the waiter asked my friend for her receipt as he placed the dish under her nose. Very unprofessional and it was his job to make sure that he served the right table before presenting the dish in front of her.P.S bring your tupperware... If you can't finish half your plate like I couldn't ...they don't offer take away boxes. Money down the drain.",
