We ended up staying there from 7pm until almost 11pm! Highly recommended for anyone looking for somewhere to eat close to South Ken tube, just ten minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall event. Great for large parties as well as solo or couples.",

The waiters were very nice. I ordered the Fusilli Pierino, it had fresh spinach, crumbled goat cheese, saffron, pine nutes and salted ricotta cheese. It was pretty tasty but kind of rich with all the cheese. It's one of those meals that you can only maybe eat a couple of bites of before it gets a little too much. I definitely recommend sharing so you can get multiple things to try and if the other dishes are as rich as this one...a few bites is just right!",

The wiseass waiter felt the need to correct our Italian pronunciation, which always annoys me and smirked at us a lot. The pizza prep area is open-plan with clearly no air conditioning as the very sweaty chef would win no food hygiene awards. Not a fan of the food either, we ordered a caprese pizza and while it was huge, it was also sopping with too much tomato and oil. Impossible to eat. \u00a0The salads are good with some nice balsamic dressing. Weird toilet situation, just one room with male, female and disabled - frosted glass doors with that ridiculous American inch gap as well. Hello privacy? Despite some trendy outdoor seating, I wouldn't come back here in a hurry.",

    "text": "Oh I dream of this place and when I can go to London again just to eat at Pierino's. My flat mate introduced me to this restaurant while I was on study abroad in London for the fall semester in 2006. She's half Italian and Irish and she raved about the food here. Lucky for her, her BF was on a similar program in the South Kensington neighborhood while we were near the British museum and Russell square.Pierino's is a small, family run Italian restaurant. It has the family dinner sort of vibe and the food is awesome! They have good pizza, pesto, risotto, salad, soup, you get my point? While on my program, I took a trip to Rome but I must say the food here was way better than the food I had there, but the gelato in Rome was delish! Anyways back to my review, this is the only restaurant on the street besides a pub and near the tube station there is a Ben's cookies which I also recommend for desert. Definitely mark this place to eat, you won't regret it!",

I don't know how to describe it, but it was odd although it was a solid experience.FoodBlack Ravioli with lobster and crab meat. This was off their daily specials. It came with a tangy-spicy thai influenced sauce and grilled cherry tomatoes on the vine. When combining everything on the dish, the bite is quite excellent. Individual elements were good as well, but all together was great. Wish there were more of the cherry tomatoes to go with the ravioli. DessertBefore choosing they have a frig/freezer in the dining area where they bring you to in order to select the dessert of your choice. Basically whatever looks good to you, get it.

    "text": "After a rather annoying struggle to make plans with our friends, I decided to take it upon myself to check Yelp (trusty Yelp!) to make dinner plans for a pre-Christmas get together. As our friends wanted to hang out in their old Imperial College stomping grounds, I quickly chose Pierino.The website for Pierino was not working but I read the reviews and called their number. Eureka! They were able to book us for dinner for eight people and had plenty of vegetarian options to spare...which is a must for a group where all but one diner are vegetarians. If you're at South Kensington station, Pierino is a short walk. Don't arrive too early - if your table isn't ready, there is no where for you to sit. Seeing as it is December and it was coming down with rain, we were annoyed about not being able to be warm and cozy before being seated for our meal. Reservations are a must - Pierino is tiny and popular. BOOK AHEAD, okay? We were seated in a rather cramped section across from the bar, but no matter. The restaurant was crowded and the fact that many of the patrons of the restaurant - as well as the staff - were speaking beautiful, musical Italian gave us good vibes that the meal would be promising. We had a bit of trouble ordering drinks due to the language barrier but our trusty waitress took our drink orders. I had a bellini (needed a bit more of the peach puree, if you ask me) and the rest of our group had lemonades or beers. We ordered starters - a mix of salads, garlic bread and bruschetta. Everything came in hearty portions (be warned, one garlic bread portion is MASSIVE while some of the salads are perfect for just two people). We chose wisely due to the help of our lovely waitress.Ordering mains wasn't difficult as there were so many vegetarian choices but BE WARNED: For some reason, at Pierino, some of the dishes that are vegetarian are NOT (seafood is not vegetarian, my friends) while other dishes are vegetarian and are not marked appropriately. Read everything you're ordering - don't trust the 'V' or lack thereof to order your meal. We selected an array of pastas (the cannelloni was ordered by three of us), pizzas, and one risotto (mine!) and waited for our meal. Pizzas arrived first and some of our friends felt strange eating but food was hot and there was no need to wait. The pastas and risotto took a bit longer but our food arrived soon enough and we dug in. All requests (please add chilis, remove mushrooms) were taken into account beautifully and we all ate our food. Portions are generous so one can eat a pizza to themselves if they'd like or order two between a pair and share. Pastas are quite big, as well.Everything about Pierino was pleasant. A few bumps in the road but the fact that it's in such a convenient location is a plus. I don't know when we'll be back but I'd like to give it another shot!",

The staff here were helpful and patient with my mangling of the Italian language. The food is great and reasonably priced. We returned for dinner later in the week. A pizza with many instruction for the lady and lobster fettuccine for me. My wife loved her pizza and my pasta had half a lobster in it and was delicious. Our banana cake dessert was tasty.

I chose the cannelloni in the end, which was very dry compared to other restaurants I've had it in (definitely would benefit from more sauce). Staff were friendly enough and were around quite frequently. Our experience here added to a lovely afternoon out in South Ken.",

That was incentive enough for me, as I ordered a thin yet moist quattro stagioni rounded off by an ornately presented salad, that looked a little like an edible palace.

    "text": "Whilst down in London with my sister, we were visiting the National History Museum and got hungry so looked for somewhere nearby to eat late lunch at. We happened upon Pierino which is located opposite the museum and checked out ratings for the place; it seemed to be alright so after a short queue, we were then seated.I get the feeling this place is always busy, being ideally located from the museum. The interior is clean with simple wooden tables and they've tried to stuff as many tables and chairs into this tiny space as possible. However, there is no table-sharing, so that was pleasant. We ended up having a 4 seater to ourselves due to the positioning of the tables near the bathroom. The placemats are simple laminate cards, which is cheap but effective due to the high turnover of customers this place no doubt gets.It did take a while to get the attention of someone, being sat quite away from the main part of the restaurant. The menu is varied, though, so there is sure to be something that suits all palettes. The specials are on a menu located to the right of the restaurant as you enter. There is, unfortunately, no printed version of this menu, so I'm afraid you'll just need to glance at it as you're waiting to be seated, or take a photo.It was a warm day when we visited, so we both ordered some San Pellegrino lemonade. These came in the bottles along with some glasses with ice in them. It took a while for the waiter to come back after we ordered our drinks. Once the order was placed, we waited a while before our food arrived. This was due to the huge number of customers. I was in no rush, but I imagine if you were, this place is probably not ideal.Pappardelle with duck ragu and crumbled amarettiI ordered the pappardelle with duck ragu from the specials menu and it was gorgeous! The crumbled amaretti added that hint of sweetness to the dish, the pasta was cooked al dente and there was plenty of ragu and duck. The pasta side of things was quite small, though, so maybe not for someone who's really hungry. The herb parsley on top was unnecessary.Gnocchi Luganese: Home made potato dumplings with fresh luganica sausage, white wine mushrooms, chilli and fresh tomatoesMy sister liked her gnocchi but felt the portion was small and the parsley here again was unnecessary. I might visit again if we were hungry after coming out from the National History Museum but I wouldn't make a deliberate trip to visit this place.",

Had a pizza margherita with basil and buffalo mozzarella for \u00a38.20, not too bad as a price given the location.The venue looks nice, only once seated you realise it's too tiny to host so many seats. Staff is not 100% Italian, and not 100% nice. Pizza itself was nice. Roman style, thus thin and crispy rather than thick like Naples style. Tomato sauce was okay, buffalo mozzarella as well and fresh basil on top (on my request). I had the impression they used soya flour for the dough and asked clarification to the waiter, who went like: \"Are you allergic?\" As I answered no he said they use normal plain flour. How can I put it, dubious?I liked the pizza overall, but will not be back, as I didn't like the service. They also serve more expensive dishes such as pasta fish or meat by the way.",

Before our food had even arrived though the place was full and buzzing with people so if you have your heart set on eating here I would suggest that you book a table in advance.I don't usually have pasta when I'm out as to me that's a super quick dish that I cook at home when I'm short on time not something that I want to pay a lot of money for but the Pappardelle Machiavelli got me with two things - 1. They called the pasta princess pasta (yes, I'm a child) and 2. It came with smoked salmon which is one of my favourite things in the whole world.Given how busy the place was and that everything is cooked right there at the front of the store (there doesn't appear to be a separate kitchen) the food came out really quickly. The portion looked quite small when it arrived but it was actually really filling and from the first bite I was hooked. It was so creamy and delicious and the amount of smoked salmon was fairly generous. The only place I have ever had better pasta was Tentazioni. The staff were nice and not overbearing although it did take us a while to get the bill when it was time to leave. Prices are reasonable especially for its location and I'd definitely recommend it for families who are in the area to check out the museums.",

The Gnocchi is amazing, and there are also rotating specials. The wine selection is also very good, which was a pleasant surprise as this restaurant is very understated. If you are in the mood for a relaxing evening with good food and wine, I would definitely recommend this establishment.",

Italian food is arguably \"easy\", in that the cuisine relies on good, fresh, clean ingredients and for fuck's sake, how do you serve overcooked, oversauced, overseasoned PASTA? It only takes the mental capacity of a fucktard to make pasta, so for an actual establishment -in South Kensington no less- to mess this up... i mean come on. And the pizzas? Lord help me with the pizza. The salad too... I had a caprese and the mozzarella was chewing gum imported from Chernobyl. I am NOT a fan.",

    "text": "My family enjoyed this pleasant, little Italian place in South Kensington. We all tried different types of pasta, everything was good. The portions were fairly large, especially for the fair price. \u00a0We just had the house red wine with dinner, which was not anything great, but they offer other wine options.My only real complaint was that we had ordered salads to start and were given no time between the salad and and the main meal being brought tot he table. The salad was very good (mostly because of the creamy dressing that was on it). While I appreciate that it did not take long for our meal to come, I think they should give the dinners some time with the starter first.We were seated inside as it was rainy the day we came (what, raining in London?!). They have a small outside area with tables (and heat lamps) that would be nice to sit outside and people watch.",

    "text": "Pros: Excellent food, good drinks list, and very reasonable prices (especially for the area).Cons: It was pretty tiny inside, which meant we were rammed right up against other tables. This is fine if the other people you're eating near are okay, but it's not great when you end up next to a really noisy table with terrible manners (there was some serious staring happening and it was very off-putting). It was also really noisy, and the front door didn't shut properly, so we got a burst of cold air from outdoors every five minutes.If I were rating just on the food, it would get 4+ stars because the food was delicious and came quickly. But the slow service and terrible atmosphere has dinged it down a lot.",

It's very clean yet still inviting, which I liked. I ordered a pasta dish with mushrooms and cheese which was beyond incredible--the cheese was fresh and the pasta tasted homemade. Most of the wait staff appeared to be Italian so I guess that explains the delectable food here! It's truly authentic and delicious. The restaurant was very quiet when I was there which was an added bonus, plus most of the items on the menu were fairly priced. I'll be back next time I'm in London!",
