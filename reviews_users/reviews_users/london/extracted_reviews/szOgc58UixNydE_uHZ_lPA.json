We used the interactive display to call for a waiter to ask why they hadn't delivered two mains 40 minutes after we had ordered but were told that sorry but the steak had run out (he said that he would remove them form our bill, jolly decent of him really). Resignedly my companions ordered small dishes of duck and pork ribsThe duck arrived 10 minutes later and was eaten but still no sign of the ribs.10 minutes later we cancelled the ribs and asked for the bill but the ribs arrivedWe received the bill and removed the optional service charge from the bill. \u00a0Asked why I explained that the service was all over the place and appalling and the woman taking the money did not seem surprised at all.DON'T GO HEREWagamamas is not very good but but a damn site better than this place and they make no pretense that it is anything other than slam it down fast food and get the customers out quick so that they get more bums on seats.I must be getting old - I want to enjoy my meal rather than cram it down and run which seems to be the view of InamoJust checked a review from 9/9/10 that raves about Chef Cam etc, piss poor CCTV pics don't cut it for me.Whoops i should have checked here first - just read the other reviews and they are all pretty damning, trouble is I never believe the reviews until I have tried the venues for myself and my leaving this review is only a way of venting my frustrations - aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgg\u00adggggggggggggghhhAt the end of this review is a poke panel multiple choice for other bits likeGood For: \u00a0 \u00a0Dessert \u00a0 \u00a0Late Night \u00a0 \u00a0Lunch \u00a0 \u00a0Dinner \u00a0 \u00a0Breakfast \u00a0 \u00a0Brunchand you can tick any but YELP you forgot to put the option \u00a0 \u00a0Nothing",

Asian fusion - try the spicy spare ribs! - Friendly staff (you don't see much of them, but when you do, they're very nice) - Great location - Right bang in the middle of Soho.

    "text": "I'd first heard of Inamo just before it opened, when I was sent a film clip outlining its interactive table concept. Then a few weeks ago, I tried it for myself. There were four of us in the group and as we hadn't reserved, we were sent to the basement bar to have a cocktail while we waited. A complimentary plate of snacks was served to us at the same time - with edamame beans and other Oriental snacks. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and we didn't mind waiting at all. The basement was pretty quiet when we were there but I can imagine it would be heaving on a Friday night. When we were taken to our table upstairs, conversation quickly stalled as our waiter gave us a quick demonstration of how to order via the touch-sensitive pad on the table, and then we started to play - with the menu, with the taxi ordering service, with the various different options on the table. Once we'd all ordered a variety from the Asiatic menu. we started to play battleships in our two respective pairs. I definitely wouldn't consider Inamo cheap, but the food is good and for the geek in us the interactive tables are fantastic fun. I think it's a great concept that we'll probably see popping up in different establishments before too long, but the thing that really won me over was being able to thrash my friend at battleships. Now, that was fun.",

Although I agree that it is a bit over priced and that the staff are a bit too cool for school. The whole booking system on their website is a bit over the top. We went on a sat for lunch, and the place was empty, yet the booking system made me feel like I was booking somewhere like 'The Fat duck'. They need to come down off their home made pedestal and get back to what they set out to do, fun, innovative way of eating great food!",

Aside from the fact that their online reservation system rocks, their answer was ALMOST immediate, by 1 min!!! We got to the place, they sat us, and we were amazed by the fact that you can order with your table, with a tactile mouse on the table you hover over the menu projected on it and you choose anything you want. You can pay games, see food with descriptions and in detail, call the waiter and pay your bill. You can even change the \"screen\" of your table with different themes!!It was an awesome experience and they have a waiter that sings in a very funny way, so we were the happiest customers ever. Oh and the food was just delicious, we had never eaten such good suchi, duck and ribs in our lifes! Defenitely worth the price (make note: it is a bit pricy, but you get lots of food!)REcommended, 5 stars and most definitely going back!",

I'd been before, but it was her first time and it took her a while to work out the table wasn't like an iPhone...you have to use the little mouse pad! I love the concept of this place - interactive tables and games while you wait. It's a geeks dream. Perfect for first dates if you're feeling awkward and group meals because you get a total for just your food on your table. Can't say fairer than that. I ordered the chicken betal leaf for starters, black cod as a main with sides of greens and rice plus a glass of wine. My total was \u00a333 which feels quite expensive, but I finished full and the food is definitely worth it. Some people have said that the waiting staff aren't very attentive, but I'd say they were pretty good last night. I had a quibble about my black cod which for \u00a315 was significantly smaller than my friends piece - and I'm a stickler for fairness in portion sizes. I complained to the manager and he brought out another piece of cod to share between us and make up for it. He handled it really well and made me feel like he was glad I brought it to his attention so he could help me. I wish all waiters were that good! Go...you'll love it and you'll tell your friends too. But expect to pay around \u00a335 for your meal.",

Luckily, whether you love or hate the innovative ordering system, the food is excellent. Was highly impressed by my set lunch menu, which started with a tasty miso soup and was followed up with some delicious cinnamon chicken. Personally I'm not so sure about the concept. The tables work really well, and although gimmicky they do make browsing and ordering food a breeze. The real problem is, like TV's in a pub, the tables end up distracting fellow diners, combine this with the less than personal service a computer provides - and the whole experience feels somewhat lacking.",

I do like the design, it's understated yet funky, with mirrors on the walls doubling as both wallpaper and lighting - if that sounds confusing you'll probably have to go yourself to see what I mean - but don't stare for too long, it can send you crazy. We had table service and somewhat efficient waiting, a little slow and she didn't have 2 of the wine choices we ordered but she gave us a decent replacement. We had some great finger food finished with a fiery cocktail that sent me over the edge - \u00a0it had a red chili in it. All in all it was around \u00a330 each for plentiful food and 3 or 4 drinks.",

    "text": "Fusion \u00a0Noun -1- Something new created by a mixture of qualities, ideas, or things.2- A style of cooking that combines ingredients and techniques from different cultures or countries. Since September 2008, the word fusion has found a new home at Inamo, a pan-Asian restaurant and bar. Illustrating the perfect fusion of the IT world's ingenuity with the creativity of the chefs' toque, Inamo is a unique concept where customers take control of their own dinner in a sci-fi dinner room experience. The story began five years ago when two young and ambitious students, fed up of waiting for their orders, decided to work on a concept where people would enjoy their meal at their own speed without depending on a waiter's availability and other customer's. Two worlds were about to merge with to attain one objective: Put the means to make each customer's dinner experience exactly what they want it to be at the tips of their fingers, literally. Mouse pads replace the paper menu to order what you want and when you want, get your bill whenever you like, even call a waiter with just the touch of a button. The lamps above your head have metamorphosed into projectors and your table is converted into an interactive tableau where you set your own ambience and design by choosing among different graphics and colours. And if your dearest love is in a challenging mood while waiting to be served, let see how you manage a game of 'battleship'. The home of technological fusion with a dining experience, Inamo could only do itself justice by serving Asian-fusion food; a combination of Japanese, Thai and Chinese cuisine. Countries of technology and innovation, this kind of cuisine finds its place among what looks like at the first glance another gadget. Nine out of ten customers come to Inamo to play with the system, expecting it to be a gimmick but then, they realize that the food is good, explains Mark Eggebrry, general manager at Inamo. We have noticed that by having access to the pictures of the dishes, people select their meal by taste instead of food orientation. Mark's choice to move from the luxury hotel, Sanderson, to Inamo was like asking a kid to design his dream game: When I was first approached about Inamo I must say I was a little bit skeptical. I interviewed with the owners four times before I saw the actual system at work and at that stage I was sold. The possibilities in my mind for this system are endless and I wanted to be a part of this very ground breaking technology and this very unique style of service. If you fancy a unique experience, step into Inamo and you wouldn't be disappointed. The food is diverse and tasty (And the 3-plate chocolate dessert to die for!), the waiters always available to help you and of course, you have a lot of fun playing with your interactive table. One advice though: order your main dish once you've finished with your starter as the team in the kitchen seem to be the most efficient cooks in London. Inamo is definitely a place to go with your friends, your geek husband or a date you want to impress.But if you're looking for a restaurant to celebrate your 25th wedding anniversary with candles and roses, you may want to come back later, unless, of course, your dearest love would appreciate a bouquet of roses as the background of her table. It's all about fusion. Mathilde's Cuisine: What is your relationship to technology?Mark Eggebrry: Personally I love everything about it, I love the fact that I can have my whole life on one device that I can use to organise and work. I just want more, everything easier thanks to technology! How do you define cooking?Cooking for me represents family and friends, coming together for an experience and each others' company. The time taken and effort put into a dish or a meal defines for me how much care was taken to prepare it. What are your influences in cooking?Most certainly for me the biggest influence is Asian cuisine, I have spent most of my career working with Asian foo and, for that very reason, I am very impressed, intrigued and inspired by the ingredients used and how they are combined to give a remarkable end product. What is your favourite sneaky snack?Off our menu I would have to say my favourite snacks are the Pork ribs and the Duck. At home, however, I am less picky and will often sit down to a bag of biltong, (South African dried beef) which I make myself! What is the last cookbook you've read?The most recent one I tried anything from (with marginal success) was Alain Ducasse, however I more frequently use a Jamie Oliver at home book, lots of easy recipes.",

The Wagyu beef was velvetine melt in your mouth goodness, the spoonfuls of tuna, ornate creations of delight and the sake warming yet fuzzy. That's where the trouble started, as our initially friendly waiter offered us 'complimentary' sake, which I took to mean 'on the house'. Next up the main food selection, as they were plating up my two friends were informed their food was not available, which was more than irritating considering everyone else was eager to dive in. When my friend said she was cross, the waiter jumped ship and hissy fitted off. The mountain of sashimi offered little respite as we were ushered to leave with an inaccurately calculated bill, that included a more expensive sake to the one dubbed 'on the house'. Such a pity, as the quality of food was conceptual, elaborate and totally 'devoursome'.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to, if for no other reason than the sheer coolness factor of it. You walk in and notice that every single table top has a different backdrop that is projected down from a projector above the table. Forget table cloths, that's so 2000. You sit down but no one comes to greet you. No, it's not bad service, it's intended. Inamo has little touchpads on all of its tables that patrons can use to order directly from the kitchen via a menu that is... you guessed it... projected from above. You place your finger on the touchpad and a menu pops up that lets you order everything from drinks to dessert to the bill. Even cooler is the fact that the projector shows you a picture of the food you're contemplating on the plate right in front of you, so you can drool at the presentation. Once you've ordered, you can take a peek at your food being prepped in the kitchen via the video feed and then someone hustles out to put it in front of you. How's that for efficiency? No more waiting for the waiter to come w/ water, or feeling guilty about summoning your server... it's mandatory! No more small talk either, which is also a plus. As for food, it's all quite nice. A blend of Japanese and Thai, they have some fantastic dishes here. Try the Cinnamon Chicken, Yellowtail Hamachi, and Beef Salad, all of which are particularly savory and memorable. Sweet decor, gimmicky ordering methodology, and delicious food make this place a fantastic spot for a date or large group. And while I'm not sure if the have karaoke, from the looks of the place, they should! When are you opening in the US, Inamo?",

I won't repeat the description that another reviewer left, but I certainly did find it \"different\" to have the menu projected onto the table and use a touch-pad to scroll through the dishes and ultimately place the order. Although it was a bit difficult to get used to not seeing the entire list of available dishes all at once, once we've gone through the list a few times it was easy to order. The technology aspect aside, I think it was quite relaxing and convenient to just order the dishes one at a time as the evening went on. No need to look for a waiter or ask for the menu again. really easy and very conducive to a long conversation :) The food was great. Black cod is definitely the dish to try. Cocktails, however, were all too sweet (and we had our share!) and when we switched to sake, we found the selection a bit small and the 2 choices we went for weren't so great. The good news is that the Long Bar, at the Sanderson Hotel, was just a few blocks away :)",

    "text": "What is Inamo? Is it a restaurant? Is an experience? Is it any good?Certainly the first of its kind I have ever been to, Inamo doesn't have menus - not paper ones anyway. Overhead projectors illuminate your table (with various table 'cloth' patterns that you can choose) and you use a little scroll pad to select from the digital menu. It's certainly novel and I had fun playing around with the different options but the technology felt slightly dated somehow. Damn you Apple and your multi-touch interfaces! There are certainly possibilities here however. I loved the kitchen webcam, the fact that you can call a taxi automatically when you leave, and it's a perfect application for ordering drinks. Maybe I'm a dying breed (at the ripe old age of 24) but part of going out to dinner is the service and Inamo confidently replaces that aspect with a literally heads down approach. More, half way through my meal I noticed how quiet the restaurant seemed, not in density, but in decibel level - everyone had they're heads down playing on their tables. Inamo has created a social and anti-social environment all at once. The future is now. \u00a0Oh right! I nearly forgot, I ate food while there. How could I have left out such an important aspect of my dining experience? This is a restaurant review after all. Maybe because the food was forgettable? Yeah that's gotta be it. Boar rolls were overly chewy but not terrible. Mushroom something something was not memorable (clearly). Inamo tries but way too hard. If they eased up on the sauce, the schtick, and decided who they were, they'd improve greatly. So what is Inamo? Like many tourist attractions, it's worth checking out if you want something you've never seen before. The technology is certainly innovative and it makes you consider why you go out to restaurants in the first place (for good and bad). If you're looking for an experience to share with friends or to see something you haven't before, Inamo is a safe bet. But if you're like me and associate 'restaurant' with food and not technology head elsewhere.",

The call to confirm reservations and ensure you understand when you need to vacate your table (remind you again when you arrive). Surprisingly it wasn't full and there were lots of empty tables. Could be because I was there early though. The price of food is quite high but I suppose this is paying for the novelty of the interactive table. I liked ordering on the table as food cameout quite quickly. The pre theatre menu between 3:30pm -6:30pm was very affordable. I paid \u00a310 for a good diverse platter of ribs , miso soup, pickles, rice, tempura. The ribs were good and tasty (flavorful bbq). The appetizers that accompanied the ribs was nice but nothing special. I also had the marble beef (carpaccio) and that was exceptionally flavorful and had many dimensions of taste- sweet,salt- as well as texture. Overall I would come back again but only to introduce friends to the novelty of the restaurant. Would recommend to try at least once.",

Tried a couple of the rolls and the appetizers. Nothing else was quite as good. The Inamo drink was a but spicy and hard to drink. Literally hard to swallow at times. Be weary of this peppery treat.The games on table were fun and battleship was the crowd favorite. Try this cool interactive experience but don't know how often I'll be returning.

Their menu doesn't change as often as somewhere like Ping Pong Dim Sum does, and while I do like the Tempura Vegetable dish, it gets old very quickly.Their spring rolls are good, but not great. Their rice is OK. Their sushi is fancy but not the best...Their staff is smiley, but not friendly. It's just \"OK\"... or more like the posh version of \"Meh\".I appreciate being able to order food in my own time and like that I can change up the light display on my table - but to be honest, if I'm going to go out with a group of friends, I like to just have things be a bit more old fashioned, and the food, well, better.If you're adventurous and are in need of a new dining experience, this place is cool. But again, after visiting this place more than once for both dinner and lunch, I feel like Ping Pong is more fun, and has much tastier food.",

    "text": "If you have never heard of Inamo then you don't watch the Gadget show LOL.They have a fully interactive service where you order your own food and drinks from the interactive menu that is projected on the table. The restaurant is in the centre of Soho opposite Lee Stafford's salon (Strange the things you take notice of. It is very classy inside. Blacks and whites. It seemed a lot smaller than I was expecting though too. Not many tables and not much room to get around. The toilets are tiny even though there are 2 cubicles in the ladies there is only 1 sink and not enough room for 2 ladies to stand in there. When it comes to ordering it couldn't be easier. You have a little touchpad (as on a laptop) and you move the cursor over the various icons. You can order from a selection of Beers and Wines and as soon as you order your drink, it is practically on your table. You have a choice of many dishes for starters and main dishes. Thius means that you don't have to wait for the rest of your party you just order when you are ready and the food arrives in about 15 minutes. Other options on the interactive menu are a chef cam where you can see streaming pictures from the kitchens to see them hard at work. To be honest I wonder if this is live or if it is just a looping recording.You can even change the ambience which has a choice of different Wallpapers for your table or you can pick random and it changes every 2 minutes. My problem with it was that it was very sensitive and I am use to clicking too hard so I almost ordered just about everything on the menu and had to keep deleting rogue orders. A WARNING! As with anything that relies on computers we know that Computers can be unreliable. As I was waiting for my food to arrive, A member of staff came and told us that the computers had gone down and therefore the kitchen had stopped coking because the orders weren't getting to them. We asked if they could possibly take the orders with a pad and pencil but they said no and that was that. So it was a shame that some of our party had only had starters which aren't very substantial. Luckily I did get my food - I had ordered the Pomegranate Duck which was worth the wait although it wasn't very warm and I wondered if it was meant to be eaten cold A great experience if the technology is working but they really should have a back up plan.",

There's a high-res projector positioned above each table that projects images down on to the table. Each seat has a little mini track-pad which controls the projected icons on the table, icons which allow you to do heeeeeeeella stuff while you dine:--see the menu--change the pattern on the (projected) \"table cloth\"--play puzzle games--find out about nearby clubs and bars--view \"Chef Cam\"-- a live camera in the kitchen that allows you to view the chefs preparing the meal--request waiter service (like a call button on an airplane)--order a taxi home. The coolest thing was the menu function; you scroll down through various categories of menus (Starters, Mains, Sides, Beer and Wine, Cocktails, Desserts, etc) and once you select a dish to view, it projects a description of the dish onto the table and a photo-quality image of the dish onto your plate. SO COOL!!! You eventually make your choice and order through the table than with a waiter, and prepare yourself for the awesome.The food was absolutely effing DELICIOUS, by the way. This isn't one of those concept-heavy substance-light sort of joints. As I was dining on an expense account, I splurged on the sashimi starter and the Kobe beef with mushroom. OMIGODSOAMAZING. Like, seriously, brah. The sashimi was fresh and flavourful, and the beef was so fantastically tender with a brilliant little charred crunch around the edge. My colleagues and I shared a couple portions of the crispy steamed vegetables, which were substantially less boring than they sound. A nice glass of Merlot to finish it off and I was one very happy camper.The only (actually quite major) problem with our meal was the method with which it was delivered. As with Wagamama's, they warn diners as they're being seated that meals may not come out at the same time. They neglected, however, to leave let us know to 15-20 minutes between placing the order for our starters and ordering our main courses. Most of our group ordered both items together, and about half of us got our mains before the starters arrived (not like in the wow-that's-speedy way but in the stuff-came-in-the-wrong-order way). Some of us (me included) didn't get our starters until everyone else had finished both courses as well as an after-diner cocktail. It was very weird. If they had explained this one detail to us at the start of the meal, things would much more fluid and this would have been a 100% 5-star dining experience.",

    "text": "Dined recently on a Sunday evening with a friend at Wardour Street site.Waited to get a table, as not reserved, but had to wait for more than 5 mins, for the front of house/reception personto show us to a table downstairs, when even asked straight away, if a table for two was available. She was too busy behind with few things, and did not attend to us immediately. At least, if someone came to us and told us, when a table would be free, or how long we would need to wait.The dishes ordered were kind of average in comparison to the prices. The menu seems to change regularly. Surely as a Japanese/Asian Fusion Restaurant, Green Tea should be shown on the menu. Not sure if there had been a change of Chef, but certainly a few of the dishes did not meet quality and one of the sushi maki order placed, when arrived, looked as if someone pressed with fingers onto the wasabi. Never seen a sushi dish in other places with side wasabi paste half eaten or rubbed along the plate. Not really, what I would call, a high standard. But, I guess every Japanese restaurant is different. Asked one of the waiting staff, on a particular dish in which I have tried previously, that it did not show on the interactive system menu, and the person was not too sure, and said he will ask his manager, but never returned with the answer. Had to ask again to someone else, but a simple question I think takes long at this particular place. Did not request or put in a order, just wanted to find out if the dish was available. The portions of the appetizers are slightly small size, and a few dish presentation has kind of stepped down. Their customer service lacks in terms of the state of the art interactive projection system. Perhaps it was just us, in which service did not meet up to our satisfaction. I think Inamo has gone down the ladder in quality and level of service.Don't be fooled by its hi-tech projection system.Plenty of high standard Japanese, Fusion restaurants in town with real service.",

We had some scallops, pork but my favorite was some sea bass sashimi that had a tea dipping sauce and it was clean and divine. I also had a very lovely flowering tea that came in a rather ornate tea pot and it complimented my meal perfectly. The food here isn't cheap but the ways in which you can play games on the table as well as change the background if you so wish is pretty cool. I also like that you can order things when you want so that you don't feel under pressure to have all your food decisions done by the time the waiter gets back or tries to upsell something or other. My only slight agitation is that they are quite strict on how long you have at a table. They aren't flexible and they will chase you out of the restaurant as your minute is up. Still, its a great idea, the quality of food is fantastic and they make cocktails to die for. Go for the experience and is a definite great place to go if you want to impress on a first date.

I also think the food is slightly overpriced and you need quite a few dishes to feel full. i probably wouldn't go back unless i was entertaining a client.",

    "text": "This is a place ive walked by countless times. My friend told me about the concept and it sounded awesome. One bipolar weather afternoon, my friend and i walked by, and as it started to rain, we decided to pop in.. The Food, was lovely. Obviously made with love and care, with well balanced flavours and elegant presentation. The service? \u00a0Well, your \"waiter\" is the cool technology that they use. The menu is projected onto the table and you have a a little touch pad that you order from. It also gives you fun little games, like battleship, that you can play against your dining partner. The human waiters themselves didnt really do much. They barely bring over the dish, dump it on your table and scamper away. When the bill came and we saw a 10% discretionary service charge on there we laughed and didn't pay it. A flaw in their cool gadget thing: you cant order everything at once. You order dish by dish, as you find them on the menu, but then it comes out so staggered that it feels really disjointed. Being as the small plates were first described to us as we sat down as \"designed to share,\" we didnt think it would be too much of a problem, but waiting 5-10 min between dishes when they were only 4-6 bites each was a bit much. The value for money was a bit off. We had this lovely hamachi sashimi with a mirin sauce that was almost \u00a37 and it only came with 4 small slices of fish. um.... yeah. \u00a0Not impressed. We spent over \u00a340 and left still hungry. I get it, you pay for the cool technology and the food is good, but i think it would be better suited for a silly dinner spot with friends where you're not noticing the poor service or small portions. They also do a cheap enough set menu, which might be another way to go, or maybe just get a large plate. The small ones, as delicious as they are, just arnt worth it.",

    "text": "What a treat! \u00a0My husband, 12 year old son and I went to Inamo tonight before seeing the play \"The Mouse Trap\". \u00a0The staff was fabulous and attentive, and were happy to help explain the interactive table and ordering system when we arrived. \u00a0The hostess suggested that each person order two small plates and one main dish to either eat by oneself or to share. We all happily scrolled through the mouse driven system embedded in the table; each \"plate\" showing up in front of you as to how the actual food would look on the plate, and with a box that described it off to the side.The ordering process was seamless and easy. The food came out looking exactly as it was shown on the interactive system, and it tasted even better! \u00a0In between ordering each plate, my husband and son played games, and my son had a great time changing the table background. \u00a0There is even an option to \"watch the kitchen\" live via the kitchen cam so you can see the chefs busy at work preparing the food.We all shared an order of Edamame to start. They were fabulous and were served with a great sauce on the side. \u00a0I had small batter dipped shrimp with a sweet/spicy sauce on the side that was to die for as my first small plate, and then a salmon roll for the second. Both were fabulous. \u00a0My son and husband both had the chicken satay with spicy peanut dipping sauce that neither could get enough of for their first small plate; my son a dumplings for his second, and my husband grilled cod wrapped in leak for his second. \u00a0Both were outstanding. \u00a0 My salmon for the large plate was amazing; my son had the black cod and was bummed when it was gone, and my husband had pork neck. \u00a0None of us could stop raving about how great this restaurant concept and food were!For dessert, we all had creme brule in a raspberry sauce. \u00a0It did not disappoint! \u00a0My husband and I were each served coffee in our own small french presses. We are here in London for my son's spring break, and told the manager that we would definitely recommend this to any of our friends coming to London, and that we would look forward to coming back! \u00a0Don't' miss this restaurant on your next trip!",

The table interface is pretty entertaining but distracting from the dining experience, esp. when you're trying catch up with friends. The sushi was pretty uninspiring and service was a bit spotty.Call me old-fashioned, but it was pretty annoying not having an attentive wait-staff come to provide suggestions and help with any trouble. It took forever to navigate the menu using the interactive tabletop thing. I would have much preferred a paper menu to order off of, that probably is a blasphemous request at Inamo. Overall, come here for a relatively fun dining experience and play battleship against the person across from you as you eat sushi but don't expect the best sushi in London here. Worth a shot to try out just to say you've done it.",

    "text": "This was my third visit to Inamo & probably the best of the three. As most people have said it is a geek's paradise to be able to order food from the interactive tables, have a peek into the kitchen through the table's webcam, change the background of the table & play memory games if you're really bored. I think what made this the best visit was the attentiveness of the staff. We had a bit of confusion about the time our table was booked & also arrived early but we were made welcome in the cocktail bar downstairs. We were seated five minutes after our booking time, with many apologies from the receptionist over the confusion (it seriously wasn't a big deal for us) I stupidly ordered my main course about two minutes after my starter, so it meant it was sitting around on the table for a while before my friend's main arrived. One of the waiters kindly noticed this & offered to heat up the food. When our final bill arrived, the two cocktails we had downstairs were the wrong cocktails, they were immediately taken off the bill. We asked about putting the right cocktails back on & the waiter said \"No probs have them on the house as you shouldn't have had the wrong ones put on\". Who were we to say no to free cocktails ;-) The staff were all extremely friendly & one of the waiters seemed genuinely excited about the opening of their new branch (Regent's Street) in December, giving a great description of what it would look like. The food was very tasty, beautifully presented and yes, as others have said, maybe the main course portions were a tad small for the price, but if you stock up on the delicious Baby ribs and vegetable tamaki beforehand you won't feel hungry. It was my friend's first visit & she was really impressed & can't wait to return with her boyfriend. I'll definitely be back again and looking forward to trying the new branch when it opens!",

Not long after, a server brings your dish. You can change the \"wallpaper\" of your table and play games while you wait too. Perhaps it's because of the table tops, but the restaurant was really dark. First, we went downstairs to the bar to meet our party for a drink before dinner. There, we were reminded of our \"time limit\" at for our reservation. Huh? We asked if we could push our reservation back a 1/2 hour so we could have a cocktail. Weird. There wasn't a line of patrons waiting at the door or anything. The cocktail lounge/bar is a little creepy, being so dark. We were kind of prodded by the staff to get to our table. As we ordered and ate, we noticed the room was emptying... no new patrons. My only guess is that they rush you so they can close on time, which seems super important in London. The food was good and the self-ordering was sort of cool, but made me question the tip. Complaint: it's a little distracting and difficult to maintain conversation with this toy around. If you have a techie in your party, he/she may never look up again!Definitely fun for the novelty, but I wouldn't go again.",

    "text": "Inamo was probably a better idea in concept than in practice. The principal theme to the restaurant is that tables double up as computer screens and that from these you can order your meal, watch the kitchen at work and even book a taxi home. The menu options is visually displayed in front of you and there is the option to set the table colour and design as you would prefer. Although I would agree that this is a clever gimmick and a fun way to order a meal, any more than half an hour in Inamo and the novelty really does wear off. Can you imagine what forty tables all set to their own florescent colour scheme actually looks like? It's only the occasional wine glass and plate of food that separates it from the Christmas light display on Oxford Street. This is a real shame because the food in Inamo is actually of a very high quality. The Black Cod was beautifully presented and melted in the mouth and the Crispy Prawns were effortlessly moreish. Unfortunately even this didn't distract us from our surroundings and we couldn't help but notice the negative effect this 'interactive' restaurant was having on some of the other tables. The couple to my left had stopped any pretence of bothering to talk to each other and were completely transfixed on a game of battleship. Another pair further along had accidentally ordered three bottles of wine at once, failing to understand the touch pad system. I'm sure there are many people that will completely disagree with this review and love all of the technological touches. Personally however, I'm more of a fan of the old fashioned approach. The focus should be on the food and not the environment and I should be able to chat away to my waiter without ringing the virtual bell on my table. If you are nervous about a first date though and conscious that the conversation might wear a bit thin then maybe Inamo is just the place. Maybe just double check there's not history of epilepsy in the family first though...",

At first they told us to wait, and that they will come to get us when the table was ready...As the lobby is nearly in-existant, we were a bit in the way, which finally lead our little group to wait outside. The staff did not really seem to care where we'd be waiting (nor did they told us about the downstairs bar where we could have waited...), and we had to go back to them regularly to check our table.Our table was located in the small room downstairs, nice and cosy, except for the walk the waitress took us through : walking in front of all services rooms and toilets to get to our table, while there were 2 others paths through the actual restaurant. Unfortunately, one of our table projector was half broken, giving us a very dim light that hurt your eyes more than anything compared to our friends'. I recon the experience is a novelty, but I hate the fact that it takes quite a while to figure out and to actually read the menu. The waitress only came 10 minutes after we sat down to explain how the tables were working...It is nice to change your table-cloth display, play little games, browse the menu, check the amount of your bill as you go; but it sort of cut your ties with your friends. \u00a0Once the novelty wears off, it is just like any other restaurant, with less service around...although it is nice to be able to order food without having to call someone.I had the glazed salmon, which was good, but not as new as I thought it would be, it tasted like in any other places. On the other hand, the hot-stone beef was quite good, and its display is a real delight. I loved the small fried praws; and some of us went for a hot plated- fish + rice (can't recall the name); which is mixed for you on the table and looked quite good. The price is quite high for the amount you get, even if it is tasty =( !Overall I'd say the food is good, but I wasn't fond of the overall concept and didn't have that much of a good experience with the service.They did not try to accomodate in any way when we where waiting, not even telling us where we could wait as a group of 6; as our table was broken, we told them it was a bit hard to actually read the menu, but they said they couldn't do anything about it (not even explain the menu apparently), the \"call a waiter\" function seems quite useless as nobody came when we needed someone..And the lady servicing us to sit us, take some of our coats ( one of my friends ask if they could take our coats, she took hers but did not bother asking anyone else for this), pay the bill,..was very unfriendly and unhelpful...",

As I'm usually up for an adventure with my sense of humour in tow, I've managed to spend entertaining and bizarre evenings in many an underground rainforest or full-on Austrian 'bierkeller'. It's a laugh, but usually, the food and drink hides itself away under the bright lights and mad surroundings. Inamo is the exception to this rather convoluted rule I have put in place. Yes, there is a big draw in its crazy tables of joy. Use the touch sensitive bit to navigate round the food and drink options, order it yourself, sit tight and wait for it to come. Even the waiting game is a little fun though, with battleships on the table and Chef Cam. And when the food does come... it's good, very good indeed. I had a speedy lunch menu (which may or may not have been its real name) - miso soup, cinnamon chicken, edamame, pickled aubergine (probably) and rice. And it was unexpectedly delicious. Great presentation and loads of food. The only downside to the process of creating a restaurant which absolves the staff of having to do any work is just that, that they do no work. The woman who served us was decidedly sulky and bored, and failed to see anything funny about my accidentally calling a taxi. It wasn't hard to do. Don't do what I did! Having said that though, I bet it happens all the time. Anyway, with an attidude like that, just as well the tables do the ordering.",

My daughter was entertained by the novelty of the table projection system so if you do decide to eat here for that reason, the ribs and prawns in the small plate menu were palatable, and the black cod on the large plate menu was fairly good as well. Service was good. We didn't stay for dessert.",

The interactive projection tables are SO MUCH FUN to use, and the image quality, even at lunchtime in daylight, is fantastic - you really can see what your food is going to look like. The feeling of sneakily ordering another beer without having to bother anyone, and drinking at your own pace is great, and when the bill comes, you can even see who's had what, ideal for parties of really tight people! Actually, not that ideal, since a bottle of lager is 4 quid, but a nice touch is that when they run out of something, it just disappears from the menu. No more, oh sorry, we haven't got any left moments - you won't EVEN KNOW they had it in the first place! Service was sadly not by T800's but by real people, and they were also frighteningly efficient, our bill arriving literally 10 seconds after we clicked send. You wouldn't want to eat here all the time, but it's definitely a taste of things to come. Oh, and the food is excellent.",

You also order the food using the table interface. There's very little interaction with the waitstaff unless you ask for it, which I didn't mind at all. You can also use the table interface for playing games with the person at your table or watching the kitchen cam; both were fun ways to pass the time as we waited for our food.The food itself is actually pretty good.

Keeping in mind I come from Seattle where Sushi is phenomenal, its very difficult for me to rate sushi restaurants well when I have a high bar of comparison. We had the following: Soft Shell Crab Roll: not good, the crab was somewhat soggy and didn't have strong flavorSalmon Sashimi: not freshTuna Role: actually not badSeared Salmon Roll: decent, but again not freshGyoza: interesting spices and flavor, but you only get 3 pieces and pay around $7 usd. Overpriced for what you are getting. Malaysia noodles: this was actually really delicious. It was in a yellow curry, good spices, but overpriced at $18 usd",

The technology is fantastically cool and worked well (except the \"kitchen cam\" was down). \u00a0Basically, you order with a touchpad built into your table, with a screen that shines down to cover your table top. \u00a0Touching a dish, for instance, shows a picture of the dish on your plate. \u00a0You select what you want through the touchpad -- the kitchen cooks it and a live waiter/waitress delivers it to your table.One advantage of the system is that you can order incrementally, which is a dining style I personally really prefer.Kitchen and service, despite the restaurant being 2/3rds empty was surprisingly slow, but we were relaxed and not in a rush.The food was quite good. \u00a0The cooked dishes were more special than the sushi/sashimi.A la carte and drink prices are a bit high -- it's more special occasion or date pricing than a normal gig place. \u00a0They also have some set menus, which we did not try.In summary, if you're a tech geek and like Asian fusion like me, this place is 5 stars. If you're here mainly for the food, you'll probably feel it's over-priced.I have no affiliation with this restaurant nor (to the best of my knowledge) anyone who works there.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ novel, interactive tables and menus+ tasty food, but...- over priced- small portion sizes- disjointed customer serviceThe idea of ordering your food and drinks via a computer, projected onto the table, really excited my inner geek, but the novelty factor wears off quickly. First, the good: the whole table is covered in projected graphics and comes with two mouse pads on opposite end of the tables so that each diner can browse through the interactive menu and order separately. When each dish is selected, a picture of the food is projected onto the big round plate to whet one's appetite, although the resolution isn't superb so the photos are very fuzzy. While it was fun for the first few minutes working out how the fairly intuitive system works, I didn't like how you could only view one item of the menu at a time and navigation soon became quite tiresome. There are also other fun features such as maps of the restaurant, surrounding area (which supposedly highlights other fun places to go but it had little useful information), a live stream of the kitchen, and few computer games). Now, the bad: The food was fairly tasty, but it was both over priced and under portion, as in small portion sizes. For example, a small dish (kind of like a starter) of 5pcs. sushi was about \u00a38, but each piece was so small that a child could eat it in one mouthful. I would have expected proper size sushi at that price... While the big dish, resembling a main, was slightly more generous, it was doubled the price of those offered by similar establishments in the area.For two of us, we had a starter and a main each plus a bottle of wine, and the bill came to just under \u00a380. This is a fair price for most London restaurants, but the portion size has put me off. For the novelty factor and decent food, I would have rated it at 3-star, but I feel compelled to knock another star off for the disjointed service. We came for a 6:30pm evening service on a Monday and was promptly told we only have 1.5 hours, which we were happy with given it's the week of the London Olympic Games as well. When 8pm rolled around, the head waitress came over and said we have to vacate our table, despite the fact that around us were at least 3 empty tables with no one queuing, which I thought was not only rude but also made very little business sense. To top it off, as she left, another waitress came by and asked if we wanted another drink as she whisked away our empty wine bottle. We would have gladly stayed for an (overpriced) cocktail or digestif but decided to take our business elsewhere. All in all, Inamo is one of those places you visit to say you've been there and done that, but it's not worth a second visit after all that kerfuffle, unless they a) improve customer service, b) enhance the interactive system, and c) serve up proper portion of food (or at least make the price a little bit more realistically in line with other restaurants...).",

Waiters should be able to concentrate on really explaining the food and chefs could focus on quality control.

The poor waiters have to act like mini-IT technicians to work to intercept the virtual orders. The tables around us kept getting the wrong food, as did we. Still, the ordering system is a blast to use. Missing the crayons and coloring pages you got to entertain you as a kid? Draw with the mouse! Inamo would also be a great place for a date. Bored? Surf the menu! Can't decide what you want? Order everything in your basket and then decide right before checkout! You can't eat computers and this is a restaurant, so down the important stuff...Food-wise, Imano's fusion is solid but not particularly interesting.

However, it is fabulous if you have kids in tow. They can play around with the table tech and play games. My son has never been so enthusiastic in a restaurant situation.The food: mediocre. Well, the flavour was very mediocre. The presentation very good. But it lacked any punch whatsoever. Small portions - highly priced.The sushi rice seemed to have absolutely no sushinoko involved in its creation and therefore lacked flavour. We had to keep asking for soy sauce as no condiments are on the table.Once dishes are on the table the projected tech element dissolves into a farce as it cannot possibly be used after that.The \"daily recipe\"ice cream was rubbish. And it was incredulous that no one could tell me what the days flavour was! I had to try and work it out for myself until the waitress finally turned up with a scrap of paper telling me it was banana etc....terrible ice cream.Service was O.K. Friendly but rather aloof.Techno fad. Rather pointless and disappointing. But the kids will love it...",

One warning to be made: I was there with a group of 6 people and we somehow lost track of how much we were ordering and we ended up with more food that initially thought. But everything was delicious so we ate it all!will come back",

The menu is projected onto your table, and you can literally see what you're looking at ordering, sort of on your plate (although the sizing isn't really correct).It is an AYCE place, so that should've tempered my expectations, but given the hype surrounding it \u00a0(my cousins were certainly raving about it, and they've been to Japan and China, and I always thought they are finicky eaters (boy, was I wrong), I thought this place would be different.Well, it was different - the most expensive AYCE place I've ever been to (and probably will be), having spent nearly \u00a350 to feed myself.Never again.",

The table is basically a computer monitor where you order your food, can play games, change the colors, etc. The concept is cool, the food is not. Portions are tinier than tapas, more like bites. It's pricey and the quality isn't worth it. We had edamame and miso soup which you can't mess up. Then hubby had chicken satay skewers, and I, a seared salmon maki roll. My roll was insanely skinny and literally 4 petite bites and his were 3 tiny pieces. Both were also pretty bland and tasteless. We got some drinks to help the situation but just kept playing with the table. Even though it's fun to play with something while eating, I'd recommend skipping if you're actually hungry. 2 stars are for the service which was ok",

Walked in and everything was so interactive, who needs waiters when you can order from a click of a button from your table and the order goes straight to the kitchen!.... And you can play games aganist your lunch date too, kept us both occupied. It was so easy to order the food, you can almost go a bit nuts and order too much, but I made sure we didnt. Ordered a few sushi dishes, tiger king prawns, korean chicken wings, chicken satay, kimchi, and edamame beans.The sushi was ok, nothing special, the tiger king prawns was another story, it was very fishy, the sauce on the outside was very tasty, but what a messy job to de-shell. Wings weren't anything special, although I did like the satay wings especially the chunky peanut sauce :) I usually like kimchi, but this was not good!! It made my mouth go all funny and when I do not like something, i make these weird facial expressions, that happened a lot at this place.As it was a quiet sunday, the food came out pretty quick, but there was no wow factor, it just seems like a mediocre place, I like the concept, its better than receiving table service, and there aren't no pesky waiters asking you if you're enjoying your food every 10 minutes, and you can only respond with a mouthful. However not a place I'd visit again....",

We booked and were therefore seated quickly and instantly shown how to order etc using the interactive tables.The whole concept is pretty cool - a projector which projects a photo of the dish on to your \"plate\" on the table so you can see what you are going to get along with a description before you order. Flicking through the cocktail menu then the food menu in this way was pretty fun and ordering from it was easy enough. Also being able to play games while waiting was fun however you can't deny it is gimicky and would expect the service and quality of food to compensate as the food is pretty pricey.The food was good however the portions were so small. 2 small sliders with a small bowl of fries was \u00a317! And chicken satay skewers to start were nearly \u00a310. I would come back here for the set menu which does make it good value for money however the experience my friend and I had was a hefty \u00a380 bill for 2 small starters, 2 small mains and a few cocktails. Additionally they add service when half the work is done for them!",

Quite low lighting, but the tables are fully lit by a projector which allows them to be interactive. Each table has a iPad with the menu on, which allows you to pick your order without calling for a waitress. We had slight issues trying to remove items from our order, so needed to get a waitress in the end. My favourite part of this experience was being able to play games against each other, I really enjoyed my time here. I only have one fault and that is the tables are quite small so you can feel quite cramped if you have people on the tables next to you.",

The interactive tables are great, you can change the table cloth, order food/drinks, and can play games (battleship). This is the best thing about the resturant. However the service was not the best, as we had to wait over 20min \u00a0for our reservation. The menu is nothing grand, was expecting a lot more options. For example only had two soup and curry options. The portions were very small, I sear I had the skinnest sushi roll ever...lol It is a place to go just once for the experience, but I will not be back.",

    "text": "I have heard SO MUCH about Inamo that my expectations were high. So when it came to picking a location for our anniversary, we thought it would be a good place to check out.So if you hadn't realised yet, Inamo is well known for having these interactive tables you can order from, and they serve Asian Fusion food. All good.How was it? Well sadly, it underperformed. Let me explain why.Service: For a place that isn't supposed to have any service, it managed to be a bit questionable. It took them 15min to turn on our table that would let us order, and the waiters constantly looked overwhelmed. Some were nice, some were less nice. Small minus point there.Food: So I get that you're paying a premium for the novelty, and although it was \"good\", it was not the level I would have expected it to be for the price we were paying. We had a few plates of Asian Tapas and Sushi to start off with: portions were relatively small, and it was overall a bit bland and un-exciting.For our bigger dishes we went for the crispy duck (a bit dry) and the marinated chicken - which was by far the best dish of the evening. We chose sorbet for desert, but as a consistent theme, they weren't amazing.Technology: Interesting concept that took me back to Japan where ordering on a tablet is relatively common. However - and don't call me a spoil sport - I found the technology a bit out-dated, it would have been amazing 3-5 years ago, but today it kind of feels a bit gimmicky. My touchpad wasn't working properly and would add stuff in my orders list without me selecting them - which made me very pretty frustrated. The few games that were on there were a fun entertainment though, had fun with those.So in short: It was a fun experience, I'm happy we went regardless. But probably wouldn't go again.",

HOWEVER - I noticed something interesting during our meal. Normally, we are a group that's very good about not texting at the table and trying to engage each other in conversation. We put away our phones or turn them screen-down when we're eating. But because there was technology already at the table, it almost felt like we had license to use our phones, partly to document everything, but also because we were already disengaged from conversation by the colorful lights and images.The food itself is really mediocre. There isn't a great selection, and the things that are available are vague combinations of Asian fusion dishes that taste too bland to be identified as any kind of authentic regional cuisine. The portions are really tiny for what you pay. On top of that, I will credit the concept creator for this restaurant for the brilliant idea to make ordering so easy that we just kept ordering more and more food, oblivious to the price since we put in many individual, repeated orders rather than ordering all at once. My bill came to over \u00a330 and I was still kind of hungry at the end.It's kind of a cool place to check out once, but I probably won't be going back until they make significant improvements to their cuisine.",

    "text": "A friend from NYC came to town and said she's been to inamo and really wanted to go back. i made the Soho reservation since she hadn't been to that area yet.I used toptable. When i tried to change it from 2 to 3 people five minutes after booking, it said they could not accommodate. Like a reasonable person, I called. No answer. I tried a few times. Still no answer. When I did arrive with a 3rd, they could not accommodate. At least my friend was understanding. We were sat and it took a while for someone to come explain how to order to us.Plus side:-The ordering on the table is really cool. I liked that the food options would appear from the projector on the plate in front of you. We also changed our 'tablecloth' for each course.-Had a \u00a315 bottle of wine. (it was decent)-Served the \u00a315 two course set menu all night (even though toptable said only until 7)-The man who brought our bill was italian. And friendly. Why it's a 2:-I made a joke with the man showing us how to use the table that it discriminates against Lefties (mouse is built into table ONLY on the right side). Mind you I said this with a smile. He did not recognize the semi joke and responded in such a manner - but not one with any sincerity or levity. -Spicy Eggplant as the 'small.' So this was a lot. But, it was pretty oily and the skin not crispy enough.-Yuzu sauce on the salmon. While I liked the flavor, sort of overwhelming. Could they have halved the amount to give some flavor but not engulf?Maybe they couldn't have controlled the various fruit flies that hung around our meal. But maybe they could have. Really annoying.I will say, my friend's duck pancakes looked wonderful. Her seared salmon sushi starter was ok - not too big.Cool concept but the food didn't match up.",

    "text": "Well what can I say, it's probably the start of way restaurants are going in an all futuristic way! this place is amazing and probably one of my best places to to eat recently!. Upon arrival you are taken to your table and the waiter explains how to order your drinks and food, as you can see in my pictures the tables have the information projected down to the table from above and controlled with a built in mouse, you choose your items and send to the kitchen, also while your order is being cooked you can play games (even 2 player games like Battleships with the person opposite you) also there's a Kitchen Camera that shows the live feed so you can see the chefs preparing the meals in the Kitchen, you can even plan your journey home or even order a cab from the table. The food tastes amazing, my favourite dish being the Scallops, one good thing about this place is if you are in a party of 3 or more you can see your individual amount on your table and the overall group amount, only one criticism I would say is that we sat downstairs near the toilets/kitchen entrance and felt a bit like we was in the overflow bargain basement as all the ambience I felt was upstairs in the main area, so if you do go, ask for a table upstairs, but to finish my review the whole concept of this restaurant is a big step into the future and I would go back from time to time to experience new dishes!",

As far as I was concerned I was prepared to accept something average because what caught my eye was the fancy gadgetry at Inamo. The projected table displays create a uniquely chilled ambiance at this place as well as taking all the hassle out of waiting to be serverd. I won't try to repeat what they describe on their own website but basically you can change the background 'skin' on your table at your leisure. Sounds like nothing much but the range of images from rain forest to views of space really set a nice tone for the meal. Then you just order everything from the interactive menu at each persons place. Including another round of beer which arrives within 2 mins! Good food and funky technology, perfectly combined.",

The best things that you are in control of, the ambience of your own table, and ordering cocktails at the flick of a finger.

Its is not the greatest quality of projection, infact its quire shabby, theres no excuse as its meant to be the centrepiece of the restaurant, invest in decent projectors guys! and my touchpad had some rice stuck in it - well informed design???Extras in the interactive system were great, games, call the waiter / ess over and view the bill so far!!! i wonder how much of a pain it is to incorporate one of those 'spilt the bill calculators into the system since they are so ubiqtous - well on the iphone it is.Noteworthy dishes in our order were the Kailan (side) and the thai red curry. I ordered peppermint tea which was damn good peppermint tea as it happens, i think it was called 'whole leave peppermint tea' i had a tripple choclate dessert which i thought was really overpriced!Do make reservations or like me you will end up waiting for and hour and a half - if youre lucky!",

    "text": "We came to Inamo to celebrate the birthday of a friend ... and it turned out to be a birthday party with a difference.It started off on a bad note. We came 15 mins before time and so were asked to wait. The five of us went outside and were chatting. When we went back in 10 mins later (still before our reservation time), we were told that they couldn't find us and so had given our table to some other group. This was really uncalled for. However they subsequently arranged seats for us very soon. Everybody has talked about the futuristic computerized table. You can see the dishes in scale as if they were set in front of you. You can order from there, play games, look at maps, check your bill, and as my friend (the birthday boy ) did, set a timer to automatically change the table cloth pattern every 2 mins :)The food was good, but not exceptional. I liked the starters, wild boar and oyster. I had taken a set menu for the main course. With sushi, prime ribs and edamame, it really was a fusion menu. Tasted pretty good and we were all stuffed by the time we finished.Note that unlike most Asian places, they do not serve rice with their thai curries ... it has to be ordered separately.Inamo didn't serve birthday cakes, but they allowed us to get our own and cut it there :) ... half an extra star to them for this.Overall the food was more like 3 star, but its definitely worth a visit for its distinctive ambience.",

Having arrived into London that morning, we were tired and jet lagged and tried to eat at the inamo down the street in St James but they were closed for a private party so they pointed us to their other branch in Soho. When we got there, we were told they couldn't seat us and we needed to wait an hour at least for the next table. There were empty tables in the restaurant and we pleaded with them to make an effort to accommodate us earlier since we were tired and hungry. Not only did the manager turn us back rudely, she didn't seem to care at all when I said that their attitude cost them loyal customers. I am writing this review to remind everyone reading it that courtesy and customer service are as important as food when rating a restaurant. This one was a clear disappointment due to the pretentious attitude of the manager.",

Having eaten there on a friday night might have been the first mistake, but not receiving the human support that is needed in a restaurant is more then disappointing. A waiting time of 60 min in a half full restaurant was one of the things that went wrong from the beginning on. Not knowing what the food is tasting like, as no waiter was describing it was another. Being surprised about the spiciness of the food, even so that it was not advertised as such, another. Having to justify why I did not like the food, and why, just another point. Being treating with no respect after complaining of the lack of support/information about the state of the flawed meal. another. Therefore I would advice anybody if there want to go there for the Interactive tables. Go there but do go further then any starters. This is the review of the London out Mains, however, suffered from inflated prices and miniature portions. The hot stone rib eye was laughable \u00a0a munchkin-sized sponge of beef atop a soap-sized 'hot' plate that didn't actually manage to 'cook the beef to [our] liking' \u00a0fortunately, we do like our steak still mooing, and the kitchen has since admitted to the stone not working as well as they'd hoped. Marinated quail (singular) was finger-licking good, though poorly matched with plum wine-poached nashi pear that managed to emulate the sickly taste of cotton candy. An evening that had started on a high note with amusement and accomplished starters ended up leaving us unsated and unsatisfied, pining for some more substantial grub in a nearby Soho greasy spoon.",

The USP of this restaurant (if you haven't already worked it out from the other reviews) is that the menu is projected on to your table and you select your food from the list using a small 'mouse pad type thing' i.e. the waiting staff do not take your order. each time you 'point' to a dish on the list a picture of it is projected on to your 'plate' (and round white pastic disc on the table!) which helps with deciding. You can order your drinks in the same way, which is good because they arrive at the table within 2 mins of ordering and you don't have to wait to be asked. Once you have ordered your food you can 'play around' with the menu whilst you wait. They have games such as battleships which you can play against your fellow diners, or you can watch the chef prepare your food on the kitchen webcam. You can also change your 'tablecloth' to project different patterns and colours onto your table. When you are all done you simply click 'bring me the bill' and you are good to go. As far as the food goes, the portions were not huge but the food was really good, strong flavours and very good quality. Having said that, it was very priceyfor what we got - I think you are paying for the novelty of the place. This is not somewhere you want want to go on a regular basis, but a good choice to take someone who has never been to Inamo before, will certainly wow and amuse them!",
