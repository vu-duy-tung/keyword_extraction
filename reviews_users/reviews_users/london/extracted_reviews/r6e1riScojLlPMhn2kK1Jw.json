I wasn't sure about it at first because it doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's on a pretty touristy street, but after looking up reviews we decided to give it a shot. Also, the place was packed on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch which was a great sign. We ordered hot and sour soup, which is a favorite of mine, and theirs did not disappoint. We also got two beef dishes, crispy fried, and some other sweet and tangy kind and both were delicious. My friend ordered an eel dish and loved her entree. Definitely a must if you are in the area.

We all had to waddle out the door by the time we were through.We went there for a dinner the weekend of Chinese New Year and just be warned that for busy nights like that their reservations will only be for an hour and a half.

The lobster noodles are probably the best thing on offer here, though recently it seems they're using less ginger. This upsets me. You literally cannot have enough ginger in any dish involving either noodles or lobster. With a dish consisting entirely of noodles and lobster it would take the entire ginger output of a small nation to reach the optimal amount in my eyes, so possibly take this advice with a pinch of salt.The small scallops are masterful, the larger scallops less so but worth eating if they're claiming to have run out of the wee ones. They haven't, they're just hoarding them for the staff to eat when the place closes. I'M ONTO THEM.The drunken chicken is also worth a mention.",

The only other Chinese meal I had in the previous three weeks was at Crispy Duck on my second night in London. So here I was back in London on my final night, and my cousin suggested Mandarin Kitchens. I was told that Mandarin Kitchens is one of the higher end Chinese restuarants in London with its white tablecloths. I soon found out they charge pretty high end as well. For our party of three we had a Fish Soup, Steamed Seabass, and Lobster Noodles. The soup was flavorful yet pretty standard, the steamed seabass was good, and you'd be hard pressed to screw up a dish that's laced with a whole lobster. While I know we may have ordered some of the higher price items on the menu, I never would have thought three items would cost 65 bucks. Oh waaaait, it was 65 quid. And back then that equated to $130. So there ya go, $130 for a three item meal for three.",

    "text": "Full post and photos @ thecattylife.com  Our mission for the night: lobster noodle. But we first indulged in some traditional starters (which do not frequent my little Chinese palate nearly as often as I would like): jellyfish with cucumber (and a not-too-heavy sprinkling of sesame oil), sliced pork knuckle, and deep fried baby squid in garlic & chilli (incredibly tender, in a light and peppery batter). The starters were followed by another recommended dish: shredded duck with hoisin sauce, cucumber and shallots, wrapped in a light floury pancake. The duck \u00a0moist, crispy, very fresh \u00a0was tasty but at this point I was a bit like, dude, lobster. I came for lobster! My vibes must have sent a little pin-prick pulse straight into the waitress's behind because suddenly there she was and lo' and behold because we love food, because we're greedy, and most of all because it was lobster, we ordered twice as much as any normal person would \u00a0two enormous lobsters to be shared between the five of us, atop a five tonne plate of egg noodles. Ok not five tonnes, but definitely two big red lobsters. Nom nom nom! Having been presented with plates of lobster-heaven, our conversation hit an abrupt stop as we all literally threw our faces into the goodness. What can I say? The lobsters were big, meaty, soft, sweet and with roe ~ quite simply orgasmic ~ and the perfectly cooked noodles were coated in a not-too-sticky gravy containing a good hearty decent amount of shallots. Because here at the catty life there is no such thing as too much shallots. Two lobsters really hit the spot. We toyed with the idea of fighting over da-bao (take-out) if we couldn't finish, but really, who are we kidding here? Lock, stock, barrel and all of the gravy, inhaled within five solid minutes of gastro-induced conversation strike. It really wasn't like there was anything in this world that could have followed up the amazing lobster meal, but the troopers that we are, we gave it a go. On the dessert menu was red bean pancakes (fresh, crispy edges and packed full of red bean paste), toffee banana (too cute as individual banana balls) and almond jelly (great solid texture, not the soft crumbly stuff) but what impressed me most of all was the complimentary fruit platter which was OMG not just oranges, but a pseudo fruit salad of strawberries, kiwi fruit, melon, pineapple and well, oranges. Big thumbs up to Mandarin Kitchen!",

The other shellfish on offer was also extremely tasty and the food was all imbeccably presented and some of the dishes looked like works of art. The prices may seem a little higher than the other Chinese restaurants in Queensway, but it is good value for money as the food is perfectly cooked and there are so many new things to try.

In the book, the lobster noodles here are described as one of the \"trifecta\" of Chinese restaurants in London (the others being roast duck from Four Seasons and...I forget the last one, whoops). So we walked to the restaurant and I already knew what we were getting - we also ordered a salt and pepper chicken wing appetizer just to add to the meal. The lobster tasted SO good (I'd say fresh, but I'm not a seafood expert so not sure if that's the right term; the noodles were fine but the lobster really made the dish). They serve it in front of you and give you a pick, as well as plates for the shells and lemon water (I hope for washing your hands, because that's what I used it for...) The chicken wings were also delicious - perfect amount of crunchiness and a great contrast to the tossed noodles. If you're looking through the menu and can't find lobster noodles, that's because (I learned from the receipt) it's actually the lobster with ginger / scallion + noodles. One star off because the serving staff made me feel somewhat intimidated (not sure if I was projecting after reading a book about rich Asians frequenting the restaurant) - I was actually kind of scared to ask what the lemon water was for and just copied another table. Awesome food though!",

    "text": "I went for dinner with friends and had a fab time. We ordered crispy duck, lobster noodles, mafo tofu and string beans. Everything was solid and flavourful, with my favourites being the lobster noodles and string beans. Whilst the crispy duck was great, it wasn't too different from other roast or pecking duck I had had. Mafo tofu was good too, but not spicy or strongly flavoured as I would have liked. Service was okay, but when it got busy, we found it very difficult to get anyone's attention. Otherwise, interactions with staff were very limited (not surprising for a Chinese restaurant). Ambience was spacious and clean, but nothing fancy or sophisticated. Great to have a casual meal or even celebrate an occasion, but don't expect anything too decorative.",

Meat was moist and placed in a wrapper, with hoisin sauce, small slices of cucumber and scallions. The sauce was a bit sweet, and if you like it spicy, add some chilli sauce. Roll the wrapper, and enjoy. We followed up with their signature lobster noodle, which was superb. The lobster was fresh, and the noodle sauce was slot on. We then had a number of dishes - pork slices with chillies, chicken, mushroom and tofu, fried rice. We would highly recommend if you would like a great Chinese dinner.",
