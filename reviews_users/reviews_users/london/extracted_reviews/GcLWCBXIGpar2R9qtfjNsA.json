Yes, I can indeed imagine that there are sometimes spoiled kids roaming around the place high on milkshakes, but during my visit the atmosphere was great, the service was impeccable and the burgers were absolutely lush. In fact, it was the best burger I'd ever eaten. Nachos to start, burgers and fries for main with a milkshake for dessert makes for a pretty awesome meal in my book, and with a lovely window table where you can watch the West London world go by as the day fades into night, I'm pretty sure this was my first visit of many.",

He told me to be prepared to pay around \u00a310 for a burger and chips, and I did so although I could have spent much more had I have gone all out with my burger choice. For example, I only had a classic burger with a grilled mushroom. But had I have had a special Byron burger, I would have had to fork out \u00a38 for the burger alone. The burger was pretty damn good, they say it was medium rare but it was a little more to the rare side- this meant it was delicious, juicy flavoursome. With ketchup and mayo and the gherkin INSIDE (they serve it next to the burger for some reason) it was near perfect. I had the hand cut chips and they were a bit soggy, but I like that. I also nicked some onion rings off people and they were crispy, although a little greasy. I did the same with my boyfriend's milkshake, it was very good, but I don't think I could have handled it aswell. Byron's is a great place to go with mates or with family, our waiter was really funny and helpful. Thumb up!I had a massive food hangover the next day though, and felt like I would never eat again.",

    "text": "It's right across the street from the cinema, which makes it super convenient. Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend. I had a burger with blue cheese and avocado that was DELICIOUS. It was cooked perfectly. It really irritates me that in London burger places aren't allowed to cook them rare - as that's the only way I like mine done. But this one was on the more rare side of medium, so I was happy. I had a side of fries, which weren't great. They reminded me of McDonald's fries. They're too thin. I asked for some extra pickles on the side and got a plate with 4 extras, which made me very happy. Their pickles are FABULOUS, and a nice American touch. My friend and I also split the tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole while we waited, and they were fantastic. The salsa and guacamole is truly some of the best that I've ever had - it tastes very homemade. I had a malted Oreo milkshake that was delicious. The service was a bit patchy, however, as when we wanted to order and also to get the bill, we actually had to stand up to get someone's attention. There weren't waiters constantly walking past the table whose attention we could grab. I have to say I prefer GBK, as their burgers taste better, their fries taste better, and their selection of burgers is much better. I get a bit bored of the lack of variety at Byron. I wish they did delivery, as well.",

I remember blessing the skies when the first ones started to appear but with GBKs, Ultimate Burgers, Hamburger Unions and countless others on every street corner it has started to get a bit ridiculous hasn't it? Now it seems the norm to spend \u00a310+ on a burger and have to go order it at the till yourself.Put your hand on your heart and swear you'll never forget that McDonalds do a hamburger for 99p.So what about Byron? Well, Giles Coren lured me here crowning this the best burger in London in his excellent column last year. Now, I'm not going to try and match his cunning wit with my review, but I'll concur with his diagnosis. This is a cracking burger.... a ghostly white powdery bun encasing a fine chunk of Scottish farm beef - for only \u00a33. Sure, you'll probably inflate yourself up to \u00a38 by plumping for something more luxurious like the Byron burger (with added cheese and some fancy rare bacon) but it could well be worth it. Every bite brings a nice textural feel and buzzes the buds as well.I only got take out, but the venue is a great (and probably ungodly expensive) location - full of light and right by the entrance to Holland Park. Rumour has it that they serve Brooklyn Lager too... that's a great beer.",

Anyway, putting aside the kid-factor for a moment and considering the menu, I must admit that Byron does burgers right. They're a bit steep in price but in line with my expectations for an eatery on High Street Ken. I paid 15 quid for Byron burger, hand-cut chips and Coke(including a tip).

Anyway we had, at best, an hour to kill and went in to Byron's for a burger. The whole place is stylishly modern - lots of black and white and it sells itself on good quality ingredients. The clientele was a good mix of young families, groups of young people and grown ups. We paid about \u00a315 each for burgers, sides and beers. Not as cheap as a certain Scottish establishment which also sells burgers but they can blow it out their bottom because the food here was infinitely better and \u00a315 was well worth it. The staff were all friendly and helpful. They brought me the wrong burger but corrected the error quickly enough so I wasn't left too far behind my friends. BTW, my friends have an allergy to onions, garlic and the like but this wasn't a problem for them. I, however, don't have an allergy so ordered the onion rings. They were the best onion rings I've ever tasted (and I have a thing for onion rings). They were light, crispy and I wasn't forced to shove the whole thing in my mouth because of a tough onion inside. The burger was very nice - not tough or chewy and it was the right size for picking up and biting into (I hate it when you have to eat your gourmet burger with a knife and fork). The waiter came over just enough times to make sure everything was okay and we got our bill as soon as we asked for it. I wish I was able to get to Kensington more easily so that I could come here more often.",

    "text": "As an American who has spent over a year in Europe searching for a decent hamburger has been a personal quest of mine. Finally after endless attempts I found a real, quality American style burger in the heart of London at Byron. The meat was tasty, they actually managed to cook it medium and the flavors were spot on.They have American style fast food fries as well as English chips. Other American favorites fill the menu like onion rings and shakes. They even have real A&W Root Beer, a true taste from home I never saw anywhere else in Europe.The service at the Kensington High Street location was fast and super friendly. Every waitress in the place was friendly and eager to please. If you're searching for a bit of economical American food in London I can't recommend it highly enough. Best burgers I've had in Europe by a mile.",

    "text": "When an American goes abroad there are a few daunting worries they are sometimes faced with: abiding by visa regulations, currency conversion, cultural barriers....and the quest for the authentic burger. My beau and I attempted this place a while back after he heard about it from a friend of his. In my book, word of mouth is always good, delicious burger in mouth is always better. I've been here a few times now, and every time I'm greeted by friendly staff \u00a0with minimal to no waiting time for a table. \u00a0The atmosphere is warm and well-lit and there are little stylish nuances about the place that you can't help but notice: silly comics and pictures on postcards for the place, or a playing card on your table. The menu may appear limited at first, but in my experience this is usually a good thing for burger joints. They have more than you can handle, and even a drink menu that ups the class a couple notches. I'm pretty sure we took a photo of the label of what their \"best white wine\" was that first night so we could remember to buy it again later. Who would have thought?!Burger lovers from all over can gather here and know that they even have options for vegetarians or those who prefer the \"skinny\" bun-free burger (a concept that will forever remain elusive to me) and options for those who are constantly arguing with limited capacity of their stomach. I think my only criticism would be the price of the sides. Not that they're too much, but just that they're \u00e0 la carte. \u00a0As any American burger enthusiast would know, most burger restaurants have a meal deal that includes a drink and a side...and it's so conveniently classy that you can just order it by number (\"I'll take a #6 please!). \u00a0But I'm not one to judge. \u00a0Maybe it's to curb our habit to over eat, maybe it's to allow the burger to proudly stand on its own...maybe it's a genius business scheme because everyone knows that even if we're told french fries (chips) can cause cancer, we know they will always make the burger taste better. \u00a0Either way, as a proud American I'll join others (US and UK alike) in a coalition effort to recommend this restaurant for the food and service. \u00a0If this were high school, and each menu item were a member of the school's soccer (football) team, I would proudly say that I've dated most of them. I wandered over to the Byron website and the \"Story\" section starts like this:\"The Byron story hails from the misspent nights of my youth. \u00a0During a four year stint in America, I ate enough hamburgers to sink the Titanic.\"And I'm sold all over again.",

They were delightfully crisp on the outside and nicely done on the inside.We visited this particular branch about 3 times during a recent stay in London, and the Byron burger was excellent x2, and just so-so 1/3 of the time. Service was always pleasant and quick, but not too hurried. \u00a0I enjoyed the contemporary decor and the fact that the beer and wine lists were not too expensive, nor too complicated. Indeed, after a very long day of sightseeing, standing, and walking around, a burger and a bottle of wine is a great way to relax. I've had better burgers, but Byron's food was perfectly fine with quality and service solid enough to keep us coming back for more. (During cold weather, avoid sitting near the front door. Free WiFi with login is a nice touch for out-of-towners).",

Other than that, Byron is pretty standard, American, burger fare. It reminds me a lot of the Shake Shack chain in NYC, but the food isn't quite as good. Having the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant isn't all it's cracked up to be. If anything, it makes the rest of the restaurant insanely hot. I do appreciate their beer selection, though. They generally stock The Kernel Brewery's IPA and my beloved Goose Island Honker's Ale from Chicago. I also appreciate the choice between fries and onion rings, as I'm more of an onion ring girl. It's definitely not my first choice in London, but Byron satisfies my American-style burger craving without having to go too far from home--pretty much the point of chain restaurants, right?",

Service and pricing is still OK but the meat must have slipped a notch in grade. Nothing truly bad but previous visits have been top notch for taste. This visit, there seemed to be some gristle or bone in the patty making for a less than great experience. The salad I got instead of fries was very good and along with a bottle of London Pride, saved the evening.I will likely try Byron again, perhaps at this location or one of the others to see if it was just an off night or a victim of tough economic times.",

They gave me a sore tongue.If you throw in a few extras the bill is way too high. Actually, if you throw in no extras the bill's way too high.The atmosphere is very corporate. In fact there is no atmosphere and a burger joint should be fun, not feel like somewhere you pop into at Munich Airport when your plane's been delayed.The music was turned down but thudded away in the background adding to the general uneasy feeling this hollow place gave me.
