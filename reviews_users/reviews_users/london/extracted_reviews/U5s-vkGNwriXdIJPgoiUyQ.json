It's saucy and quite rich. When I'm feeling a bit \"vegeterianish\", I go for the Thai vegetable green curry with tofu. It has chilli but is not too hot.The prices are good for the quantity of food. There is also a selection of soup noodle dishes, salads and starters. Service is quick and friendly.Neds also donates some of their profits to a charity called Mencare, which I think is really nice.",

Our last experience with Asian food during our vacation wasn't so successful; sushi in Ibiza Town in Ibiza, not good! They just took the vinegar part of sushi rice TOO FAR. So we decided to go to Neds since we were fiending for anything remotely Asian, something just like at home.While it wasn't that familiar taste we were looking for, Neds hit the spot. Though, a little too much sauce! It was decent tasting, portions were generous, it was convenient, quick and there were lots of menu options. In fact, Ned was at the register when we were there. Felt like a little cool take-out lunch joint you'd find in SOMA in San Francisco. Neat spot.",

Service was fast and friendly. \u00a0It's pricey for the amount of food, but it's in a tourist area so expect no less. If you're new to Chinese noodles, oyster sauce is the go-to sauce for most asian marinade so go with that if you have no desire to be adventurous. Chinese bbq was good, thai curry tastes as it sounds and sweet and sour is good but can get boring because the flavor is typically not meant as a sauce for noodles in my opinion. Careful for the bot sauce!",

The seaweed was overly spicy, salty, and tough to chew, and I just really didn't like the noodle dish at all. It was more than 80% noodles and very bland. The prices are also too high. However, the delivery was rapid and courteous and it's good to try new things, but I won't be back.",

And I was just in that mood for noodles, you know that mood that overcomes you (presumably it is dictated by your stomach), so after a quick wander I found this independent chain and went for it.Nice interior, little bit like a diner but they hadn't taken the theme all the way.Friendly staff, they didn't give you that bored look when you're staring at the menu - normally I hate those people that get to the front of a queue and then try and decide what to have. Fortunately today there was not queue so I didn't care as much!I had chinese bbq (if that exists, it tasted like teriyaki) chicken egg noodles - you can choose your protein, noodle type and sauce which is always nice. Possible to accompany it with some spring rolls etc but I though that would make me look too fat on my own - this is the point in the review where the readers should exclaim, 'You, fat, never!' Thanks in advance for that guys!\u00a37.25 was expensive food the look of the place (fast food-esque) so I was expecting good noodles and was a bit disappointed. They were quite greasy and swimming in sauce. If it cost \u00a35 I would be fine with that, but there were no better than Wasabi and 1.5x the price. Portion was less too.All in all, not worth it. If I'm fancying noodles again I will go a few metres further in the other direction and stick with Wasabi.",

Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian...we like them all. My boys are at that age where they like to eat large portions of most anything in sight. We had just come from a morning tour of the Tower of London to ride the London Eye and we had not had breakfast. We were starving! Arriving about an hour early, we decided to grab a bite at Ned's Noodle Bar before taking the ride up for a fantastic view of London. Ned's offers three type of noodles and an assortment of meats. Each of us ordered a different noodle and a different meat item so that we could try a nice variety of things. Unfortunately, all three dishes were a BIG disappointment. The noodles did not taste fresh, the meat portions were tiny, and the flavor was just not good. Despite being very hungry, neither of my sons ate half of a very average size portion of food. We all agreed, Ned's Noodle Bar deserves a 1 star rating...at best! I would not waste your time or money at this place.",

The price is extremely affordable at around 6-8 pounds for a meal, however the wait is well over 20 minutes and the food is mediocre. The meal was warm as they prepare it on the spot, but the sweet and sour chicken was a huge disappointment. My girlfriend got the vegetable udon with Thai Curry and was satisfied. Overall not a stand out experience",

Friendly staff,no BS or attitude.- The place won't rock your world in terms of your foodie experience here but it's perfectly good and it is what it is. Good value too.Check all of the above.All round a successful formula.",

I ordered the Udon noodles with Chinese BBQ sauce with beef. The beef wasn't beefy enough for me...the texture seemed off. The udon noodles were spot on with chewiness and texture. I only ate half of the portion...there was a ton. Definitely could share. My toddler absolutely loved.",

So, we ended up with the pretty menu handed to us on the street and after daily 70\u00a3 dinners we decided to go there for a less costly family of five meal one night. Somehow though we still ended up paying close to 60\u00a3 for the whole meal. I would say no matter what the sauce was, all the dishes tasted pretty much the same, some more fishy, but I've never seen such a gross chicken on rice that my 4 year old got - the chicken was literally in a glue like sauce, sticky and slimy. Yuk, he totally passed on that. Green curry was more like a starchy sauce with some curry taste. Vegetables - mostly carrots, canned corn, some overbooked cabbage.",
