    "text": "I came to Roti King with my co-workers for lunch. One of them has been raving about it for awhile, so we finally headed over there to give it a try. I'm still confused about whether it's Malaysian or Indian. Apparently Roti Canai was originally an Indian dish and moved to Malaysia. So maybe it's both? The curries that it was served with did seem quite Indian, but maybe it's that borrowing from another culture thing? I don't know.What I do know is that the Roti Canai they have here are delicious. They have a special as well which are two Roti Canai with a small side of curry for \u00a35.50. It's a good deal, but if you're really hungry, it may not be enough. We also split some other flatbreads they had as well. Two of them were stuffed with meat (one with chicken and one with lamb) and the final one was stuffed with cheese and spinach. And it was a lot of cheese. Possibly too much cheese. I wasn't a huge fan of the stuffed ones either, although they did also come with the lentil curry for dipping. My Roti Canai was also served with the lentil curry, but they also have fish, lamb and chicken curry available. The place isn't the cleanest looking inside, so if you can look past that, I think you can have a good meal here. Apparently they also do Chinese, but we stuck with the Roti and curry. I would also try to use the toilet before arriving, as the one available also isn't in the best shape. But I'd come back. The Roti Canai and curries were tasty and quite cheap so it makes for a good lunch.",

The food does take a while to come - especially the roti - so its not very suitable for lunch breaks, but if you have the time, its definitely worth the wait! I highly recommend the Laksa, its \u00a37 so not dead cheap but thats the price you expect to pay in central London anyways.The decoration's meh - like a cafeteria - so no thrills there, slightly over cramped with chairs and tables but no biggy.Conclusion: Unappealing exterior, anthentic Malaysian food!",

I had no idea what to expect as this was a new sort of culinary adventure for me. We all had different things. I had the chicken-stuffed roti, one friend had the eggy variety and others had the non-stuffed curry-based dishes. All five of us gobbled the food down with relish! It was so so so good and most of us ate for less than 6 pounds each - amazing! The place was super warm and the service could've been better, but as there are only about 8 tables nothing took terribly long.",

I haven't tried the Laksa, but I hear good things!Perhaps a better place to share a few dishes I would think.My main concern is the size of the place... it really doesn't seem cut out for the attention is has been getting recently, so I would think another move may soon be on the cards (thanks to the yelpers!)",

I really think they forgot us. at one point I saw our server pointing at us and picking up a bill saying 'long time.' the roti was delicious. the lamb curry was very bony but tender but not much of it. the dhal was quite nice but very smooth and not much in the bowl \u00a0- about half full. it's not expensive. curries were \u00a34 and $5.50. I thought it quite good, my partner thought it was rubbish , our new york friend said 'amazing!' but it did fill our stomachs on a very cold night. oh and it didn't seem very grimy, just crowded with tight seating. and I was glad not to have had to use the toilet that was in the stairwell leading down from the street.so ... the food is pretty good. the service was very slow and unapologetic. bill for three people's curries and one green tea - \u00a315.50. they actually billed us \u00a310.50 but we thought they must mean higher. maybe i'd go back and have the sweet roti - I wouldn't be disappointed with the curry then.",

Read a very flattering review in The Guardian for this place that was complimentary of the good food but harsh on the decor and atmosphere and it was pretty spot on. Waited in a long queue on a Friday night to eat here so word has already spread about Roti King's new venue (moved from East London) - food is tasty and especially the roti which you can see being made from the small kitchen in the middle of the busy dining area. Not for the picky and not v refined but reasonably priced nice tasting food (I wasn't even offered the Chinese menu but all the previous decor is still around)",

I say keep it pure and simple with roti canai (i.e. two rotis with a small bowl of daal, which is more sauce than lentils). But you could go for an option with a small curry-type dish, with chicken, mutton or fish. Whichever, just get that flaky, doughy, sexy roti. I order an extra one when I go to make sure I can maximise the dipping. At \u00a34 for roti canai, which is a perfectly adequate sized meal (large lunch, small dinner), you cannot go wrong. Very keen to try the dessert rotis. There's almost always a queue of some kind (I have thus far gone twice at lunch time and once at dinner, but one other lunch didn't bother because the queue was up the stairs out into the road). It moves pretty quickly because the food is quick and most people probably vacate their tables in 20-40 minutes depending on the volume of food they're getting and how busy things are. I really like the vibe too - it's bustly, has been done up enough to look quite hipster but retains a certain rough-and-readiness that totally charms me. Warning: a colleague went for a noodle dish and was disappointed. I can't comment but I would say rotis seem to be the speciality.",

First off, it's in tiny location without that much seating and there was a 40 minute queue when we got there around 8pm. The makeshift signage and the fact that the restaurant is in a basement in a side street made me a bit apprehensive, but I'm so glad we waited around to eat here. (so, I recommend that you go in a smaller group as it'll get you seated faster, as we bypassed a few bigger groups.) It's a pretty no-frills place, you can expect to be crammed next to other customers.I got the Char Keoy Teow (stir fried flat noodles) and we split a roti canai special with chicken. The roti canai was very tasty, with a good amount of spice so as not to be overwhelming, and really nice and flaky on the outside. Definitely the star of the night. The noodles were pretty good as well, but nothing too outstanding; what I remember from that night was definitely the roti.If you're in the area, totally worth a shot for the great taste and low price!",

    "text": "Roti King, Euston - it is easy to tell if one is Malaysian. Can you guess? This is when a Malaysian starts talking. We are famous for our Manglish vocabulary of the 'lah-s' or 'mah-s' at the end of sentences. It is not perfect English (but perfect Manglish), in fact I am sometimes forgiven for my pigeon English when I have said something that could be interpreted as offensive, but it gave a warm feeling of hearing the slang in a foreign country. The place is tiny. It can take up to 30 diners at a time. Even if the place is not at its full capacity, once you are seated it is better to stay put. This is not easy if you have a child. I also suspect that the ventilation is not good enough. The lingering smoke from high heat stir-frying was not appealing. You walked out of Roti King smelling of food. But the food here is proper Malaysian, mamak style; in fact, this is the only place in London that does roti canai, the bready thing that you flip and flop and toss and turn to get a light yet stodgy, crispy and moist at the same time with a curry sauce to complete the dish. It is probably the most popular breakfast choice. Lunch time specials from 12:00 hours to 15:00 hours include a two course meal from GBP 6.50 - GBP 8.50 seems like a good deal. These are dishes which have more in common with the economy rice stalls that you get in Malaysia.One of the reasons that mamak stalls in Malaysia grew was because of their drinks offered; teh tarik (pulled tea), ABC (crushed ice with various ingredients), coffee, milo (hot chocolate), etc which you also get it here at Roti King. Desserts are not available here but they have a few sweet roti. No alcohol is served.After ordering it took a while before our food was served. Do not be surprised if food does not arrive all together at the same time. Dishes are served when they are ready, another mamak way of serving. Takeaways are available.lamb murtabak GBP 5.00 - The lamb filling is moist with a crispy pastry. It was pretty good except that the minced lamb was very mild and did not have a strong muttony taste. roti canai with dhal GBP 4.50 - probably the European flour gives it a slightly different texture from the Malaysian, however, it is a joy to eat one of my favourite dishes in London.roti canai special (ie. with chicken curry) GBP 5.50mamak mee goreng GBP 6.50 - this is a MUST to order. Spicy and nicely moist for a wet-ish and slippery plate of noodles. Delicious!bee hoon goreng GBP 6.50 - it could be a little spicier for my taste. We of course had a good service since we knew them and it was all quite laid back. We enjoyed it because we wanted to be left on our own. Parking is not easy in the area but Euston station is a short walk away.If you want an experience of the mamak stall in England, make sure you eat here at Roti King before considering a 13 hours direct flight to Malaysia. As a Malaysian myself, I confirm that Roti King is the real deal here.",

But who cares if the food is good. And the food is good and cheap. It's not a huge portion by any means but the roti special gives you choice of fish, lamb or chicken. I go for classic chicken and you get to roti breads. For a first timer you should go for the roti as that is what this place is about. It's extremely good. \u00a0I also had a Malaysian Coffee. It was luke warm and slightly less stronger than a Vietnamese Coffee (my fav). Overall I will definitely come back to try more dishes.",

I got my main about 10mins before my partner got his main and then we got our starter once we'd both finished eating - odd. But they're clearly understaffed. The hot lemon and honey drink was delicious! Especially in this cold weather - but again we got these after the mains were served.The decor is trying to be edgy industrial - they have the whole vintage lightbulbs and black metal work with contrasting wood thing going on - but it gets lost and you mainly see a shabby hole of a restaurant - not that this should put you off!Our bill ended up coming to \u00a326 - not bad for a starter, 2 mains, a dessert and two drinks.

    "text": "It is hard to find good Malaysian food in London, and particularly good freshly made roti canai like back home in Malaysia.I first tried Roti King when he was based on Charing Cross Road. And I have also tried his tasty roti at Malaysian festivals around London.The restaurant itself is quite small and slightly cramp, but when the food is good I am willing to compromise on this. A must-order dish is obviously the Roti. You can order them served with dhal, fish curry, lamb curry (all really good), or there are some sweet options as well! Unlike most places in London, their roti is all freshly made and has a nice flaky texture.The murtabak is quite yummy as well.The curry laksa is also very good. I personally prefer the assam laksa version, but I also do enjoy the curry version like this one. The flavours are nice and the soup is very coconut-y. It kind of resembled Curry Mee that I have back home in Penang.I tried the bee hoon goreng on my most recent visit. If you like spicy foods like me then I would recommend requesting for them to add more chilli!The bee hoon was a bit plain, so we requested for some sambal to go with it, which was then mush tastier.I have previously also tried their mee goreng, which isn't too bad.For drinks, I always order teh tarik, which you can have hot or cold.They also have do as kacang if you want some dessert!If you don't have time to eat in, you can always order to takeaway.One of my regular places in London for good value Malaysian food, I would definitely recommend.",

Never mind the very basic interior decor because the food is good!I had the mee goreng and plain roti canai. They were very generous with the mee goreng portion. I was surprised that I managed to finish the whole plate of noodles. Mee goreng was nice, not too dry but not hot enough. I had to ask for some sambal (chilli paste) to add to the hotness! The plain roti canai (2 pieces) \u00a34.00 was simply delicious. The roti was crispy and freshly made. You can actually see the chef making the rotis from the kitchen. They do other rotis stuffed with either eggs, chicken, lamb, cheese or spinach. The dhall curry was spicy but, again, not hot enough to my liking.They also do sweet rotis with planta, banana, kaya or chocolate flavour. These will be suitable as desserts.An authentic Malaysian restaurant that I will return to!",

Its right near Euston station, but make sure you have some cash because it's cash only and the nearest ATM is in the station. Yep, this place is pretty popular and even at around 9pm we waited for about 30ming (outside on the stairs.) Luckily the weather was nice but come prepared. Like the other reviews stated, the staff is not friendly and honestly that's what drops the rating to 3 stars. The place is also overcrowded and you have to share really tiny tables with other dinners. You also have to get your own water, which gets annoying if your sharing a table because everyone has to get up to let you out (bench seating.) But if you ignore all that, the food is amazing and worth it. We ordered the roti canai specials, 1 chicken and 1 lamb. Each order comes with 2 huge rotis and a bowl of curry. Definitely more than enough food and both the chicken and lamb were awesome. Come with some patience and you'll have a great time and eat delicious roti.",

    "text": "I've had good memories of this guy ever since I started getting food from him at the now closed Oriental City. He had a small stand in the food court and was a one man operation specialising in Roti Chanai and the like. It was good, a lot like the ones I used to get with family when we visited Singapore, the paratha and curry being good facsimiles of what I used to get as a kid. We'd go to the food court up in Colindale, get that, and some dim sum from an adjoining stall and have a good meal. And then Oriental City closed and with it went the Roti King. We didn't know where he went until he turned up in Kopi Tiam, and was the best thing there, before a disagreement between the two joint owners lead to a split (two restaurants opened up next door to each other) and finally closure. And we lost him again. I heard news that he'd reopened there and finally got round to seeing his new place. It looks like he controls it now, instead of taking space in an existing restaurant. It was busy when I went in about 9pm, I'd finished college and handed some papers in to be marked and was on my way home on the bus when I realised that he was near Euston, which I was passing through. I jumped off of the bus and went down the side road next to Secrets (easiest way of identifying the right street, the purple awning stands out). From the outside, it doesn't look like much, just another takeaway/local Chinese spot, albeit one with a nice sign that says Roti King. Going inside, it still doesn't look impressive, chairs and tables are a little stuffed in, but it's relatively clean and you can see the Roti King himself, first and foremost making the Roti in the front of the restaurant. They showed me to my table and gave me two menus, one for Roti, and one for Chinese food. I ignored the Chinese food and concentrated on the Roti, all of the dishes are around the \u00a35 mark, some up to \u00a35.50 or so, some less. I went for the lamb murtabak and the Roti Chanai with chicken curry. It took about 15 minutes and then arrived in all of its crispy goodness, it's a South Indian bread that's cooked on a griddle until the outsides are crisp but the insides still pliable. It's served with a curry dipping sauce, Murtabak is the similar bread but with a filling of onion, egg and in my case, lamb. The lentil curry was a good compliment while the chicken curry was great with the Paratha. I have no shame about digging into the dishes with both hands, tearing the bread apart before dipping in curry and consuming. Over too soon, I needed to get home and study for a while. I paid up (\u00a313 including a traditional coffee sweetened with condensed milk) and I was out of the door, full and heading home. Nice to find him again and I'll be back, with my parents next time. My dad had a mixed response when I called to tell him I'd been, half happy that I had found it, and half annoyed that I'd gone without him!Going to have to take off a star for the way the place looks, don't know how long he's been there but the furniture could use an update.",

One sad thing would be that this place is very small and gets very crowded during the peak hour.

A restaurant hidden on the backstreets of Euston and worked its way up to be one of the most well known places for roti canai in LondonIt is a no reservation restaurant but I would advise anyone visiting to arrive early or eat outside peak hours as within half an hour of opening the restaurant at 12pm, it was packed full and a queue was already forming.The restaurant has recently gone through a lovely renovation where they have made it more rustic looking with its wooden panelling and filament bulb lighting. The open kitchen also means food is delivered quickly and you can see the roti being made.Green tea was quite generic. I did expected loose leaves but maybe that was too much to ask for.Soy bean mix with grass jelly however was superb. It tasted like it was freshly made in the store, rich in bean taste with strong nutty notes. The grass jelly was finely chopped and added a nice textural difference to the drink. Very refreshing with the spicy foodKari LaksaVery comforting with a good amount of spices and depth. The consistency was perfect too, thick and rich which clung well onto the lovely bouncy egg noodles. The heat builds up as you eat it although still very mild if you compare it to the ones in Malaysia but probably for the best as I cannot handle spice very well. \u00a0Prawns were fresh and bouncy too and chicken were succulent and tender . Tofu puffs soaked up the broth well and the fish balls were incredibly soft and satisfying to bite into seeing how springy they were. Just wish they gave us a more generous portions of noodles Bee Hoon goreng Even before we ate it the aromas activated our tastebuds with its wonderful spices and smokiness conveying all the signs of good wok energy. And we weren't wrong. The noodles were lightly charred due to the heat of the hot wok. It wasn't greasy and the noodles were perfectly cooked, soften and al dente. It was seasoned perfectly, good savoury flavours with nice it's of flavours from the juicy prawns, chicken and squid. The beansprouts and onions gave the dish a lovely crunch. Haven't had noodles cooked so well and skilfully in a London restaurant for a while. Most of them tend to be greasy.Roti Canai Special (fish)Definitely the best roti you can get in London. Being freshly made in house with high level of skill they were incredibly doughy and airy. I love how pliable they were too, keeping its doughiness and firmed through out, even after they were dipped in the curry.The curry was nice and thick with strong complex savoury spices. It had a slight tangy edge to it which was move lovable I mopped everything clean was my rotI. The only disappointment was the fish inside as it was deep fried so heavily in batter I couldn't really taste or get a feel of its flakey texture. Luckily I love batter itself so it was fine.Kangkung belacan By far one of the best morning glory dishes I've had in London. Full of wok energy allowing the ingredients such as the shrimp paste, garlic and chillies to flavour the morning glory. For such a simple dish, it was packed full of flavour.I would happily return to Roti King any day. It's like home-style dishes, cooked with great skill, wok energy and all packed with flavour using fresh ingredients. Prices are very reasonable too which means you can order several dishes without breaking the bank. Please try and stick to the Malaysian dishes as you can get many of the other dishes elsewhere (mostly Cantonese) but it will be hard to find such an authentic take on the Malaysian dishes anywhere else in London.",

I loved the decor of this little restaurant...a bit hipster with an area where you can watch them make the roti. I had the highly acclaimed roti canai, which was very flavorful and satisfying. I also tried their tea with the condensed milk...so wonderful! The price wasn't bad either. I would highly recommend this restaurant. P.s. this place gets buuuusy! It's worth the wait.",

The food came fast. It close at 11p which most places close by 9pm. Soy milk ran out. The meal was inexpensive: 29 pounds for 4 dishes and a drink. Water you self serve. It's extremely convenient: only a block from the station. You will need to speak to the waitress to put your name down for a seat. The toilet is right outside of the door to enter the small restaurant. They use only a fan and open part of a window for fresh air.Ordered - roti filled w/ spinach & cheese- Noodle \u00a0w/ coconut curry with tofu- Rice dish w/ sides of spicy shrimp paste, cucumber, egg, tiny dry fish, fried chicken, peanuts - mix vegetable with ginger- Malaysian Pull tea \u00a0w/ condense milk",

The tea tarik was good enough, though I don't know if I will get it next time. The roti canai was also very good. The restaurant itself is kind of shady. It is down a stairway, next to a bathroom. Apparently, it used to be an old Chinese restaurant, and they haven't replaced some of the Chinese signs. It is close to being a dump, but, if decor is not your thing, give this place a try.",

    "text": "Roti King is tucked away in a corner near Euston and is known for its roti canai or what is known as roti prata in Singapore. We got in nice and early at 5.45pm so missed the evening queue which snaked up the stairs. The roti canai with chicken curry deserves a 5/5. The roti canai itself is flaky on the outside and slightly softer on the inside. The chicken curry is delicious but there could have been more. We also got some Kari laksa which was a decent effort. The coconut milk based broth was rich in flavour and spicy. The components were a bit lacking however. The noodles only came with a few subpar fish balls and tofu puffs. Definitely not comparable to something you might get in Malaysia or Singapore.The iced milo is good but the milo dinosaur is a bit more disappointing as it doesn't come heaped with Milo powder as it should. As for the ambience, it's very no-frills. You will usually have to share a small table in the evenings with strangers and it can get cramped at times. However, the prices are affordable compared to some other places in London for Malaysian and Singaporean food. My only gripe is the service. It was very poor. We weren't offered any tap water at all, and were physically told to leave and had the bill thrust at us because they wanted to seat some other people and our plates had gotten empty. I get that they want to keep their line outside moving but there is a much nicer way of saying that and we had only just finished eating. Regardless, I would still recommend this place for a slice of home.",

We had a roti which was yummy. Get the fish curry sauce (or both!)We also has two rice noodle dishes. I let my eating partners do all the ordering so I am not sure about the dishes' names but one was wet noodles (with gravy) and the other was dry. Both were delicious and had a bit more of a spicy kick that what you would encounter at a Chinese restaurant. Roti King is a hole in the wall and definitely more shabby than chic. But come for the yummy food. We arrived at around 2pm and the place was mostly empty.",

It's a small place and did fill up quickly at lunchtimeJust a quick heads up. The location is shabby and not in an ironic shabby chic way. Expect fraying faded chairs and after reading previous reviews and seeing the toilet door for myself, even this Malaysian native wasn't brave enough to peek inside the toiletIf you can get past that, there's an authentic looking Malaysian menu. The highlights are of course the roti canai options. Most of these are with a selection of curries, the traditional way of eating roti canai but they've gone outside the box by offering sweet options tooI went for a stuffed curry lamb option called murtabak. The flaky pastry and spiced filling was authentic and a bonus is that you can see them making your roti canaiI also went for the laksa, a spicy coconut broth based noodle soup. Lovely and fiery hot. Be warned this is one for those not of a 'korma' disposition when it comes to ordering curry!Only place to get freshly made roti canai that I've seen in London (the round shaped ones you get at other restaurants have been frozen) but be aware the surroundings aren't glamorous",

After finding out it was cash only, I went to retrieve cash from a nearby ATM and came back to Roti King. Once I ordered my food and tried to pay the waitress rudely told me they had no change to give me. Apparently the person delivering the change had not yet arrived. I tried to work something out but the waitress just yelled \"We have no change!\", shoved my money back into my hands, and walked away from the register. Maybe they were having a rough morning but that level of disregard for a customer was unnecessary and rude. Will be buying lunch elsewhere.",

We both decided that Roti Canai special with chicken was the way and waited for it to appear.With the swift service and fast cooking time, you can tell that Roti King makes it money by turning over the tables fast!

The restaurant is very small and _very_ casual, it's a basement with a set of stairs. It was packed the first night at 9pm with a lineup up the stairs and down the street. We decided to call them and do take out, glad we did as the food was ready in 15 minutes. Turns out the line up is for seated guests only.The roti is crispy, fluffy, and flaky - seriously delicious. The curry was flavourful, colourful, and had a hint of spice which was not too overpowering. The butter sugar was bloody amazing. Crispy, sweet, buttery, and so good that I had 2 orders.We loved this hole in the wall roti shop so much we ate here on our last night in London!",

That roti, though -- that was really amazing, and well worth the hype.Next time around, I'd definitely like to come with someone else -- it's a fun/chaotic vibe in there, which is always better when you've got a friend with you, but more importantly, it would allow me to try more stuff. I really wanted to get the laksa, but the portion is gigantic, and I (smartly) chose not. Something to look forward to next time.",

    "text": "This was by far the BEST mealI I had in London during my last visit.Roti with curry lamb: Absolutely amazing! The roti was perfectly cooked and was very soft and fluffy. The curry was the perfect blend of spicy and savory. Roti was perfect and curry was flavorful. Coconut rice was not overwhelming with coconut flavor which I loved. Beef Rendang: first bite was not as tender as I would have liked but the rice and flavor of the meat really made everything come together and I was very happy and full from the dish.Teh tarik: Get it, if you love Thai iced tea, then you will like this less sweet version. Strong Tea flavor which is nice. Absolutely delish.People at the table with me all ordered the dishes I wanted to try and they loved everything they had.The Service was amazing and speedy.Since I wasn't able to make it back for my last meal, this will be my first stop (after fish and chips) on mynext visit.",

If i lived in London, id come here all the time! This place gets extremely busy so make sure you get here before they open or youll be waiting for awhile. Also, if you dont like sharing tables with strangers, then youll probably want to get it to go!",

When we got there, there was already a queue outside so we knew it must be good. Just our luck, we were behind a Malaysian family who gave us a brief overview of Malaysian dishes and recommended what to get. We got to Roti special and the noodle dish... sooooooo delicious! Not as spicy as we were looking for so we added chili sauce and it was perfect. Highly recommend! I'm glad i can officially say I've had Malaysian food, approved by Malaysians!",

This place is located inconveniently in a small basement space that holds a hand full of people. It doesn't matter, wait in line patiently because it's amazing. It's seriously so good. The first time we went we called for a take out order after standing in line for 30 minutes waiting to get in. We skipped the long line and picked up our food and ate in the hotel. We were a little cautious, so we only Haag 2 orders. Don't do it to yourself. Order all the curried goat and roti. You'll eat it and the container. The next time We went, we stayed because there wasn't a long line. It was so worth it to eat inside. The experience of smelling all the food and watching the chefs cook was great. I can't impress upon you enough to go here. If you're in America, fly to London and eat here. We ate here 3 times. I wanted more, but felt guilty. Now that I don't have it here, I miss it so much. Eat here. Now.",

    "text": "I'll admit it. Food is like having a whirlwind romance for me. I hear about a spot. Maybe from somebody who knows the place well. And maybe I hear... that people stand around for hours just to see them. (Or even better: nobody knows about them.)Sometimes the best ones are a little rough around the edges. Perhaps they're not the most pleasant sight to behold; and, they've got... history that you can't quite call baggage. They're authentic; LEGIT, they say. Some people have only had the pleasure in meeting them once before moving on, yet never forgetting them - even boldly sharing the experience with their friends - saying that they'll someday see them again.When people make a weekly day (or evening) visit a \"thing\" it piques my interest too. Especially when I hear that they have a pretty good call-in/takeaway/to-go system set up.So we make arrangements to meet. I just have to be there at their second opening time (5pm) to avoid the queue.I arrive. The entrance is next to the exterior toilet with Chinese writing on it from its restaurant predecessor. Smiles are exchanged and I'm sat at the table. They don't bat an eye that I've brought somebody with me. Through words and images (and prices), they pour themselves out to me. I know all their secrets and I'm still pot committed. After taking the cozy quarters in, it's my turn now: I ask questions; ask for their thoughts, and make my selections.I then patiently wait for about 20 minutes. There are more people here now as I sit googling Teh Tarik (Malaysian pulled tea, made with condensed milk.) It tastes like a food TV special. I can almost see the tea being pulled in the back. It's so romantic. I'm excited about the Chicken Murtabak on sight. It's flaky roti shaped into a large disc and filled with savory chicken, egg, and onion. Its accompanying curry is thin, yet flavorful. It crumbles beneath my fork. This is already going better than I had hoped!Then, the star shows up: The Roti Canai (the special, with fish) and curry sauce. Roti is mysterious; that is, it's hard to come by where I live. And roti like this? Fuhgeddaboutit. I lift a corner of the piled roti, and it delicately unravels like a hoop skirt from the Old South. Layer upon layer reveals itself; showing its soft underbelly and I am smitten. Large pinches of roti are dipped into the curry; a spoon scoops out small deep fried pieces of curry-soaked fish. Eventually, it's time to part ways. Satisfied, I am suddenly filled with preemptive longing, tinged with shades of regret, that I had not discovered them on my prior London trips. I leave, taking one last long look around the basement room. I won't forget you, Roti King.",

I quite enjoyed my flat noodles dish and the morning glory, and my friends really liked their laksa and roti too. The flavours were rich, and I found the ingredients (eg prawns) very fresh. The portions were healthy and at the end of it all, our bill came down to only \u00a315ish per person! Service was really great. Not too many staff, but all were friendly and prompt. Ambience is cosy and very street food-esque. I rather enjoyed that kind of experience, as opposed to a posh restaurant that does fake Asian food. Would love to return at any time!",

    "text": "Come here expecting a traditional Asian experience and you won't be disappointed. I say that because their service isn't bad.. compared to Asian standards. They want to serve you fresh food as quickly as possible and get you in and out. So yea they won't make friendly chit chat with you and they'll make you share tables with strangers but if you go in expecting it, you'll be better off.Now onto the food, I only had their roti canai with curry chicken (\u00a36.50) but I think I'd just get the roti canai with regular curry sauce next time (\u00a35). The flavoring of the curry is a little spicy and not my favorite (not bad, just not for my taste buds I suppose) but the roti was really nice, thin, perfectly chewy, and fresh and as their name is Roti King, I'd be quite disappointed if it wasn't as good as it was.There can be a little line as the shop isn't huge so try and get their before 5:30 to avoid a queue. Alternatively, you can order take away and not have to deal with a cramped space.",

Due to the small size of the venue seating is communal so if you are in a small party you will likely be sharing a table with strangers so get comfy with that idea. We had a large party sitting behind us and they were very loud and obnoxious. The food is an Indian Malyasian Singaporian fusion. I love roti and was excited to dive in after watching them make it from the window while waiting in line. The dipping sauce for the roti had a big curry flavor and it overwhelmed the buttery taste of the roti. They also don't have many vegetarian options so if you are looking for a veg variety this isn't your kinda place. The best part of the meal was the Milo Godzilla which is a Milo drink with a scoop of ice cream. This brought back a lot of childhood memories. I would not have wasted my time waiting two hours to eat here.",
