    "text": "Boooooooo-urns for Wahaca.My review is based entirely on what I could observe in my 90 seconds inside the restaurant. The decor is fine and the food looked nice, but their policy of \"You cannot put your name on the wait list until your entire party has arrived\" is so crap. I understand the sentiment behind the rule, but to be so rigid and unyielding when the last member of a party is less than ten minutes away will result in their losing business. Some stupid jerk had to work late (me)and showed up 35 minutes behind schedule, and the Front Of House guy had refused to seat my fellow Yelpers until I had arrived, even refusing to list our party on the wait list. By that point, we didn't have time to wait the 15 minute wait for a table, so we hit the road and went to Wagamama's. It's their prerogative if they want to enforce crappy rules and lose business. I just wish I'd had a chance to judge them on their food rather than their administrative issues.",

    "text": "This visit has been a long time coming. Many, many months ago a friend of mine recommended Wahaca to me, a Mexican market restaurant with several locations in London. I neglected to follow her orders. A few months after that another friend of mine declared Wahaca some of the best Mexican food she's had in London (and she's from California). Again, I neglected to go. Around the same time my internship manager also mentioned Wahaca and its deliciousness, even suggesting we go one day for lunch. Alas, it did not happen.Well, the time finally came. My mom was recently in London and I took her to what I had heard was a great Mexican place with a long wait. I can now confirm both of these things are true. The two of us ventured to Wahaca on a Saturday night and, after approximately an hour wait, we were seated with recommendations from our waitress and a bowl of chips and guac in front of us. Also in my hand was Wahaca's classic margarita, the perfect accompaniment to our Mexican meal. So far, so good. So very, very good.After some deliberation, my mom and I decided to try items that we wouldn't normally find on your typical Mexican restaurant menu. Part of what makes Wahaca so interesting is the way they serve their food. If you're feeling really hungry you can go for the bigger plates, or if you're in the mood to share, they have smaller street food dishes that are served tapas style. My mom and I loved the tapas idea and picked three dishes that seemed unique but tasty: pork pibil tacos, ceviche tostadas and new potato taquitos. All of them were fantastic but the latter two really stood out to me. First of all, they were so different. The ceviche was made with a mix of shrimp and scallops tossed with habaneros, lime, mint and salsa. I loved it. Loved it, loved it, loved it. As for the new potato taquitos, stuffed with potatoes, lettuce, feta cheese and habanero salsa, this is another dish I highly recommend. I would never think to put potatoes and feta cheese in a taquito but I'm so glad Wahaca had that genius idea.I have to admit, even just writing this review has me craving Wahaca ASAP. I'm sure I'll be satisfying my craving soon.",

When I was offered the opportunity to come to Wahaca for lunch, I was happy. \u00a0I must ask the question, shouldn't Wahaca be spelt Oaxaca? Spelling aside, the restaurant aesthetically has everything right. It is contemporary in design, airy, spacious and pleasing to look at. Whilst I was there the queue to eat remained consistent, so they are clearly very popular.Service was prompt and the server gave tips on what was good. I shared a pibili pork taco, chipotle quesadilla and a steak burrito with my lady. \u00a0I really enjoyed my meal and although I cannot attain to the authenticity of the food being traditionally Mexican, it was tasty. \u00a0Be warned though the pibili pork tacos will repeat on you for hours... Pheeew! I'm pretty sure most of the meat dishes will give you unkissable breath. \u00a0I was sat with seven friends and apart from me every one else had a complaint in regards to their meal. Nobody said the food was bad, only that they had eaten better Mexican food elsewhere. I will confess these better places were all in places abroad where an actual diaspora of Mexicans resided as a community. I like Wahaca and would recommend it.",

    "text": "Calling itself the most authentic and traditional Mexican street fare in London yet spelling Oaxaca \"Wahaca\"?Questionable. But if you are missing Mexican food like Jen not-so-secretly misses Brad, it'll do. The guac is decent, although the chips were about 10 minutes past their frying prime and tasted more like pita chips rather than corn. Don't expect any real street food like empanadas or tamales, this is far more of the taco/burrito/quesadilla especial con quinoa. (Wait, who the hell invited quinoa to the fiesta?) There was some incriminating broccoli involved too which I will refrain from commenting on. I'll keep it simple: They spelled \u00a0Oaxaca \"Wahaca,\" so what are you expecting? Basically, it's the best you're gonna get this side of the border.",

If I were stranded in the middle of a Mexican-less society (let's call this place....Lahndon, shall we?) with only Wahaca, you would be happy for the relatively good food, the cheap prices and the guacamole that's only one step above flavourless. But...there had to be a but...if I'm already in Covent Garden and craving a Marg and chorizo, I'm heading over to La Perla for some amazingness. Why? Because Wahaca is always super crowded, I hate waiting 45 minutes to just get to the BAR and then the service is always sketch because of the overcrowding. Cheap food aside, doyourself a favour and head down the road.",

    "text": "Inspired by the bustling market places of Mexico and brought to us courtesy of the now legendary Thomasina Miers, Wahaca brings mexican market food to central London. It attracts a suitably eclectic crowd from businessmen to backpackers and the resulting atmosphere is unpretentious, relaxed and colourful. It's just made for dates. It's only our recommendation, but we think Wahaca is best suited to an 'early days' date. It's bustling, relaxed and stylish which is ideal for an informal, no pressure date, but there are a couple of reasons why it might not be the best for first dates. Firstly, the intriguing but complex menu takes a bit of time to get your head around, so you've got to feel relaxed with a few minutes of silence. Secondly, this is 'hands on' food and although we think this is great for dates, it may be harder to look sexy with the content of your taco dribbling down your face (as delicious as those tacos may be). There's no advanced booking at Wahaca, so due to it's popularity, it's best to get there early. However, given it's prime location in the heart of London's West End, an early dinner will allow you plenty of time to continue your night with a film, play, musical, ballet or opera of your choosing! Wahaca Covent Garden Since Wahaca prides itself on having the best tequila in town (the 'holy elixir' of Mexico) you've really got to start with a cocktail. The fiery Bloody Maria comes highly recommended or, if you're after a more refreshing drink, try a gingery Barragan. The Wahaca's take on the toddy - a combination of chilli, chocolate and tequila - is something we'll be attempting to conjure up again and again next winter. Be experimental with the food you order - after all, you didn't come here for something ordinary! We think the best way to go is to order lots of the smaller dishes. They're so affordable that you really can go mad and even if there's one you don't like, there'll be plenty of others you'll love. It also means that it's easy to share everything between the two of you which is both practical (no waiting for each other's food to arrive) and romantic...

    "text": "I've noticed a few odd debates popping up on Yelp of late which all seem to fall into the 'Britain is bad' category such as, 'Bad British Food' 'Bad British Diets' 'Bad British Service' 'Been to Britain? It's bad you know...' As a general rule I tend to disregard most of these sweeping statements as eccentric or xenophobic- come on, do you really think we spend all our days knocking back ale, pies, chips and sausages and swearing at each other? (We save that for the weekends). There is however, one British criticism that I would grant- it's very hard to find good Mexican food. Fajitas seem to be the limit of most bars imagination and without fail these ring of Old El Paso... With this in mind I was both suspicious and excited about Wahaca's prospects. Five of us thought it would be best to get a selection of Tacos, Tostadas, Quesadillas and side dishes to really make sure we gave the place every chance and I'm glad to say it didn't disappoint. While a few of the dishes (Chicken Tinga, Chipolte Chicken) tasted virtually identical and others lacked a little spice (Pork Pibil where's your kick?) the general consensus was overwhelmingly upbeat. Not only did it make a pleasant change to order Mexican food and be able to identify actually vegetables without a melted cheese barrier but everything tasted very fresh and homemade. Our bill for 5 came to \u00a367 including plenty of drinks. Prices like this, in the middle of Covent Garden are virtually unheard of, especially not for food this tasty. Ok, it might not have been the most authentic experience but it's definitely the best Mexican I've had in London and so for this I rate Wahaca four stars!",

    "text": "It was heaving the first time I went to Wahaca - and with no bookings (queue at the door!) I was a bit skeptical. However we (girlfriend and I) left our names, went for a drink somewhere else, and came back later. Having had an excellent Mohito, we were seated pretty soon. I have to confess that I LOVE Mexican food, so I was always bound to be a fan of Wahaca - however I was surprised at how cleverly they've done a sort of tapas selection theme, which is very good value - we had a \u00a320 selection which (I think) had 6 little plates, and then we ordered some refried beans (yum - the best I've ever had, I think - a testament that they've got the little things sorted!) and tortillas. It was the perfect amount, not too much, and we both agreed it was amazing. As Molly K. mentioned - this ISN'T A TYPICAL MEXICAN RESTAURANT. But it's not trying to be - it's playful, fun, exciting and most of all - tastes incredible. For a more traditional and equally reasonably-priced Mexican option, I'd recommend Cafe Pacifico, also near Covent Garden.I've given it 4 stars only because of the inexplicable 'no bookings' policy. But for food and service, it's definitely 5 stars :-)",

On arrival we were politely told that it was a 1hr30 wait and with that we turned on our heels and walked right into a different restaurant who were able to seat us immediately. For restaurants this popular, surely a 50:50 split of pre-bookable tables/turn up tables would be fairer as a comprimise? Love the food. Hate the queues.",

Wahaca is great for the adventuresome diner in search of Mexican dishes you can't find at every corner place (if only there were taco places on every corner...)2. Fantastic service! Our server was friendly, helpful in ordering, and extremely attentive. He kept track of our order and balanced our plates and appetites perfectly. 3. \"Tequila is my Friend\" painted on the wall!

In around 15 minutes time we were able to find a table.The review won't be complete without a verdict on the food. I'd say it is 7.5/10 material. I had the chicken taco and my friends had some other dishes which I don't remember at the moment, but they seemed to have enjoyed it very much. The price is very reasonable and the portions were moderate. \u00a0I'd say I left with a content stomach.The staff were friendly and prompt. The interior of the restaurant is nice and clean with ample but subtle lighting. I also got a small packet of chili seeds from the restaurant as a gift which was a nice gesture.",

Being from Texas, we were hesitant about the authenticity of a Mexican restaurant in London, but we were very pleased and would come back again. Favorites were the sweet potato taquitos, bean and cheese quesadillas, and the mushroom empanada. Everything looked great at our neighboring tables and the place was full by the time we left. Busy bar area also. I respected that they didn't have the haddock that day because they only purchase from sustainable sources and the available fish was not up to their standards. Great find!",

    "text": "This place is a little bit like the TARDIS when you enter, as from the front it does not appear that such a tiny shop window can house such a large basement dining area. This restaurant chain is the Mexican equivalent of WAGAMAMAS and as such has its good and bad points. The place was comfortable and appeared to have a nice atmosphere, with the interior very neat and tidy. The staff were very friendly and helpful albeit not very attentive once the place started to get a little bit busy (it didn't help that our waiter finished his shift halfway through serving us!) and unusually very slow to come and collect the bill!! The food portions appeared small at first glance but when you started to tuck in it was apparent that there was plenty to eat and all at a reasonable price, especially for central London. The food (spicy roast pork)was excellent. Its been a while since I've had Mexican but I was not dissapointed. The only real issue with the place is the same issue as you get at Wagamamas; your food and the food of your fellow diners does not arrive at the same time. I cannot see how it would be too difficult for the Chefs to ensure that a tables food was prepared at the same time. My wifes food arrived over 5 minutes after mine, which appears an eon once you have started to tuck in. If you can see past this though its great for a plate of tasty wholesome grub!",

This sort of service makes a person want to come back. The food was impressive as I had over the years given up on UK Mexican food. Although on the (extremely) small side portion wise, I should not expect the mammoth American sizes outside the US. And I am sure my waistline is thankful for that fact. The tortilla chips were glossy like a street vendors, the slow cooked pork burrito perfectly seasoned and the salted ice cream delicious. I will return. No doubt about it.",

Ok that is a mean joke on my part, but for whatever reasons it has taken me until now to make it there. I will be back and I can't wait for the branch on Wardour Street to open either as that shall help with the being able to get a table. Luckily on Sunday when I went we only had to wait just under 20 minutes. We had a wonderful meal of tacos, quesadillas, soup, salad and churros! The cocktails were mindblowing and very stimulating on the senses and they also served Modelo Especial which brings back happy memories for me of eating Mexican food in San Francisco. I was there with my beloved and my sibling and we had a very relaxed meal and I must say although there was a little wait there was absolutely no pushiness for us to leave our table or to hurry up. The spirit of Sunday was upon the place and I found the staff very helpful in terms of explaining the menu and I found everything we had really beautifully cooked. The Steak tacos were moreish as was the quesadilla, we had tostadas too and the mixture of textures as well as fresh flavours made the food addictive as they were served in tapas sized portions. I really liked the taco soup too as it was poured in front of you and all the other garnishes in the bowl seemed to become 'activated' when the soup touched it. I loved these little elements of theatre and the soup was very flavorsome and palate cleansing too. It was the perfect thing to have before another beer, some lime, mint and sparkling water and churros! They are indulgent but when shared between three the guilt goes away. I am pleased that they weren't drowned out by cinnamon and had a lovely crisp bite as well as a silky chocolate sauce. My only tip for having them again is to bring a straw as you won't want to waste a single drop of that lovely chocolatey goodness. After going once I can see why people will queue for hours and why it is worth queuing for hours. Still I am more than happy to see more branches of this place as once you go you want to go again and again! The prices are very pocket friendly and the small plates aren't so microscopic that you shall leave feeling hungry.",

I went on a Friday evening --arguably not the best time to go to any restaurant in London, much less a restaurant as happening as this --and can attest that if you're prepared to wait an hour and a half for a table, you will not leave without a smile on your face. Honestly, you're right in the heart of Covent Garden, so there's not exactly any shortage of places to go and have a pre-meal cocktail.Like I mentioned, the food is incredible (you MUST try the Pork Pibil Tacos) --the ingredients are clearly extremely fresh, and presentation is lovely. the best strategy is to go with a group and order from their menu marked \"Order 2-3 per person\" to make sure you get a good selection. And don't leave without trying one (or many) of the Margaritas. I believe they're around \u00a36 each, and aren't the largest, but they are amazing.This is about as good as it gets for Mexican food this side of the Atlantic, in my experience.",

The two of us had loads to catch up on so we had no problem standing around, sipping, chatting and waiting. Yes, it does get very crowded in the confined waiting area. Our name was finally at the top of the list. We were escorted back to a tiny table for two in front of the kitchen. I think we really lucked out by scoring this table, as our server had to pass by us with his every visit to the kitchen. We never had to wait long for glasses to be refilled or plates to be cleared. The food was pretty tasty. It didn't blow my socks off, but apparently it's a little tricky to find well prepared Mexican fare in UK.

Certainly it is nothing like the Mission in San Francisco, or even E Village in NYC, but it is good. They combine classic Mexican dishes with a twist, and focus on local fresh ingredients, which makes a difference.In general, I felt the flavors were a little mild and under-seasoned for Mexican, but generally tasty. The freshness of the ingredients did come through. The drinks were well done, and the variety of tequilas was certainly strong.Service was quite friendly and helpful despite being overflowing (when I arrived, expected wait was 1 hour, which was about right). They do use a pretty modern system with iPads and buzzers to keep everyone waiting organized (mostly). It would be great if there was a little more bar space to accommodate the waiting crowd.In sum - good spot for Mexican food in London, relax and enjoy the wait with a cocktail, share a few different menu items.",

Most places in London serve a pathetic imitation of Mexican food, but while Wahaca is not the most authentic, but it's pretty close. The food is delicious and full of flavour. The queues are out the door seven days a week, for the entire duration of the opening hours. I'm a vegetarian and there are quite a few options for me, and I've only visited with meat eaters who are always completely happy. The service is very efficient so once the long wait for a table ends, your food comes right away. The drinks are good, if not a tad small. This is a busy restaurant which is rather loud so if you go, be prepared for long waits and a loud atmosphere, but really delicious Mexican food.",

Meanwhile, with a full view of the kitchen, I saw servers carrying dirty plates in one hand and picking up orders with the other. Surely this is a health code violation (it is in the US). And the food. Well, it's the usual underspiced and unadventurous big chain approach. The Tortilla soup was closer to taco pie (who uses corn chips in their tortilla soup?) and the tacquitos were served smothered in goop (what about picking them up and eating them with your hands?). The chips and sauce were well, we didn't have the pleasure because our server forgot to bring them. Why go here when you can have the real thing at mestizo?",

    "text": "Normally I don't really write about chains, but I was dragged along by a few friends who for some reason really wanted to try out Wahaca so I went with the flow. Wahaca positioned itself as a brand of Mexican street food restaurants, but if the quality is anywhere similar to what the real Mexican food is like, then perhaps I can save myself a trip to Mexico. Beef tacos lacked seasoning and tasted really bland, and the beef itself was so over cooked to a point that it tasted like rubber. Chicken taquitos were also underwhelming, the salsas lacked kicks and the sourness that it required to lift up the lightly marinated chicken. Wahaca's cooking is far too standard for my liking and at that kind of price (\u00a320 pp), there are better options elsewhere.",

If you want to go here, \u00a0definitely go with the idea to have drinks before dinner. \u00a0It makes the wait seem quicker. \u00a0We got a selection of the small plates to share. \u00a0It's definitely not authentic Mexican (I was in texas last week eating real Mexican food) \u00a0but it's pretty tasty and have a variety of flavours. \u00a0I like the idea of ordering lots and getting a variety. \u00a0My friends like this too. \u00a0I probably wouldn't go here if I only got a bigger main to myself. \u00a0The service was quick from a food delivery perspective but slow otherwise. \u00a0Not a massive issue for us though. \u00a0All in all, \u00a0a solid mid range restaurant for an evening out. \u00a0I'll be back again, \u00a0probably with different friends.",

Fifteen minutes into our meal, I got up to use the restroom...which is where my fiance and I spent the rest of the day because of the food poisoning we got. We couldn't even leave the mall because we were so sick and I had to board a plane for an 8+ hour journey back to the states being ill. Never again!

Either way, I really enjoyed our time here and would happily go back again.Arrived fairly early about 6pm and so got our name on the list and waited in the bar area for our friend to arrive. I like their beer selection and happily sank 3 beers before our table was good to go. Don't judge, it was a Friday!We went for the street food and some sides and for me the highlights were the pork tacos, mushroom and feta quesadilla and the guacamole! Yummy! We had several decent Margs too (it was a Friday remember) and so by the time we left Wahaca we were full of food and very happy campers.The real shame about this place is that you kinda have to plan ahead if you want to visit.

Early being five and we managed to get a table straight away and ordered lots and lots of food. Everything was good. I didn't have a bone to pick with anything. Churros, good. Tacos, good. Spicy slaw, really good. We didn't emerge outside until about 8.30. The food was brilliant, and the service was really good, and pretty attentive as well. Though it did take a while to get the bill and I did notice the huge queue of people standing by the bar (who could have been seated as there were a couple of tables free near us), which I thought was a bit crap for them. But then, maybe it's because they are really busy and not so good on the organisational front yet. But these are excuses I know.But I like that the 'matches' they give you are chili seeds that you can plant. I like that it's the type of food you can share that is good quality and the decor and ambiance was lively and bustling and I really did have a great time. I guess I just got lucky.",

Next time when she comes over here, i have Wahaca ready for her.The food is good ... there is a lot more variety than at Chilangos (which i really like btw). One dish i would really recommend is the Nopalitos (mexican cactus). Also the hibiscus flower juice is worth trying. Be a bit careful though with the bottles of chilly sauce that they nonchalantly leave at the table. At 10 times the strength of Nandos extra hot, they are deadly at anything more than the most minute of quantities.The place is very popular and you might have to spend a couple of hours waiting in the evening (apparantly they don't take bookings on weekend evenings atleast).

The setup is cool --- authentic design and embellishments, but the food was a bit \"eh\" disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not \"OMG you have to try it\" good. I ordered the steak burrito with a side of sour cream and guacamole - the closest thing to a carne asada from San Diego. The steak lacked flavor and I had to pour on the salsa verde for some zang! I went with a large group, and one person didn't get their meal until we were halfway through our meal --- i HATE when that happens...but i guess it's pretty normal here in London?So what I did enjoy? The price and the fresh guacamole! Make sure you pick up \"matches\" before leaving --- you'll find a nice surprise inside! :)",

I'd definitely recommend the chicken tinga taco and pork pibil taco (one of my favourite types of pork!). The margarita's were really nice as well and relatively inexpensive compared to other mexican places we've tried in London. at \u00a35.50, the classic is the way to go. The chips were a must as the salsa they bring out is incredible. We loved the tomatillo verde sauce they had and wish we could've had more for our main courses. The pudding was DELICIOUS! We ordered the churros with chocolated which lead to finger licking by the end of it all as the chocolate was incredibly rich and tasty. mmmmm, definitely going back to Wahaca! by the way, Sunday afternoon at 3:30 was a brilliant time to go, the place was practically empty.",

I liked the sharing platter and the churros were lovely but really make sure you order lots and share it around because the variety of flavours is fab. The restriction to only tequila based drinks was a bit much but they were lovely. There was a variety of tequila available but no wine-based drinks or any other alcohol based drinks so if you tend to share too much on tequila stick to wine. There were different styles of Mexican tapas but it seemed to lack that authentic Mexican flavour you tend to get in North America.",

Fortunately since there were only two of us, we were seated pretty much straight away. \u00a0If you're in a group of three or more.. then make sure you arrive early, at peak times, or be prepared to wait. \u00a0They don't take bookings :(So we ended up having some guacamole and salsa with nachos for a starter. \u00a0Unfortunately, the Avo in the guacamole was anything but ripe.. after trying to break a large quarter sized chunk with our forks, we had to physically cut it with a knife into cubes, to be able eat it.. Not nice.. The salsa was ok, but nothing that special.The menu didn't have any empanadas, or tamales, real simple yummy snacks I'd enjoyed in Peru, on the streets, but nothing like that to be found here.I ordered a portion of tacos, and a Black Bean quesadilla, which were both a little disappointing.. \u00a0The portion of tacos just seemed really small, and the Quesadilla whilst ok, was nothing \"too\"special. \u00a0It was ok..My friend ordered a fish, and hers seemed to be quite nice. \u00a0She definitely picked the right sized dish.Would definitely think twice before ever going back there..",

I like the atmosphere, which is light-hearted and makes you feel like you're eating street food, which is what they creators were attempting, judging by their tag-line.The dishes are really tasty and there is plenty of choice for everyone. As a vegetarian, I had about eight choices of small, sharing dishes, of which I must have tried seven. What I liked was the variety and the exciting way in which the food is served - when it's ready, you get it, no messing. The refried beans were to die for and the mini quesidillas were great, too. Add in a tasty cocktail and you've got a happy chappy.A what? I don't know. I was having fun and the memories have all come flooding back and I feel excited again and want to go back as soon as possible.",

London-Mexican is the Mexican food you get in London but really wish it was actual Mexican. There portions are similar to what you'd see in Tijuana, or as they are called, Street size. Where they lose points is in the fact that they are served more Tapas style. While they do have larger portions, it's not the same.Favorito? Si, yo tengo preferar los Black Bean Quesidillas , cerveza Pacifico y finalemente el Guacamole. Man, I haven't spoken Spanish in a while. This place will get crowded. I suggest going on a Sunday afternoon. Also, order the Margarita Sorbet with an extra shot of tequila to mix in. Then mash it together like you did ice cream when you were a kid. This is the adult version and is A-MAZ-ING!!!",

    "text": "Based on Mexican food I've had in the UK... \u00a0this is awesome! \u00a0Everytime my friend and I (yup, we're Americans...) hear about a Mexican restaurant or find one, we make it a point to try it. \u00a0I have to say that for a very long time Viva Mexico in Edinburgh has been my favourite Mexican restaurant... \u00a0it now has a rival!The sign out front said, \"Best Mexican food in London.\" \u00a0My friend Lauren said, \"I've seen that sign before, we'll be the judges of that.\" \u00a0I did not have any kind of expectations for this restaurant, but when we walked in, the atmosphere was nice and I could smell lime! \u00a0The staff were quick to get us seated and to come over and greet us. \u00a0We told our waiter that we had not been to Wahaca before and he explained everything on the menu for us and even gave us some recommendations.We were a bit torn, there were fantastic items on the street food menu, but there were also some fantastic items on the mains part... \u00a0We spotted fish tacos, but were hesitant as every place I have had them outside of San Diego has not been good... in fact some have been downright disgusting. \u00a0So we came up with a plan, we ordered the fish tacos (it comes with 2 tacos, a side of beans on top of their green rice and spicy coleslaw) to share and ordered three street food items. \u00a0Here is a play by play:Black Bean Tostadas - loved it! \u00a0It was light and it was like a mini taco salad to me. \u00a0If you have some of your fresh guacamole left from your chips and guac, spoon some of that on top... \u00a0delicious!Chicken Taquitos - They were ok, but I've had better taquitos... of various fillings. \u00a0I think the problem was the chicken itself. \u00a0It said it was marinated, but I don't think the chicken had much flavor... actually sometimes it taste like bacon.Potato and Chorizo Quesadilla - perhaps my favourite item we ordered! \u00a0I think in my head I was expecting the potato to be slices or pieces, but I think they were smashed... which gave the texture of refried beans, which I highly enjoyed. \u00a0The Chorizo was smoky, but really good with the melted cheese.Fish Tacos - I don't think anyone will ever top the fish tacos I've had in San Diego, but Wahaca gave them a run for the money. \u00a0The fish was nice, I admit I usually prefer a battered fish, but the breaded fish was nice. \u00a0The sauces were nice, although instead of the smoky salsa that was on top, that I thought was a bit to strong for the fish, I would've like a fresh pico de gallo to get the right acidity with the fish. \u00a0The beans were nice, but I really liked the green rice, but I love cilantro so that is why that suited me. \u00a0And the spicy coleslaw was nothing special, but I found it a great side to the potato and chorizo quesadilla!Beyond the food, the service was fantastic! \u00a0Our waiter was so friendly and very helpful. \u00a0He always knew when to check in on us without become annoying, but didn't ignore us after we got our food. \u00a0The food came out in stages, which was helpful because we ended up with a lot of plates on the table. \u00a0And the food came out so quickly, so if you are looking for a place to have a quick lunch... \u00a0you'll be in and out quickly... if you beat the lunch crowds! \u00a0And the prices... reasonable! \u00a0Our total (we did not have alcoholic beverages) was \u00a327.50 and we were stuffed! \u00a0However, if I were by myself, based on quite a few of the items on the menu, I could easily have a filling lunch for under \u00a310! \u00a0The next time I'm in London, you'll find me there trying even more of their menu!",

I can't really fault much - the food's not out of this world of anything, but it's more than good enough.I always go for the small plates because I love having a bit of everything - I love the Chicken Caesar taco as well as the truffle quesadilla - and the tamarind twist cocktail is very unique tasting so worth going for - if you don't drink alcohol they have the tamarind twist non-alcoholic option too.",

Safe flavours and ideas, tasty for a chain.The reason I'm giving Wahaca 2 stars rather than the 3 or 4 the food deserves however is the service. We each ordered 2 dishes and the first round all came out at the same time, all good so far. That's where it all fell apart. We all finished our tacos, then came one portion of taquitos and a side. Then nothing. After a few minutes we insisted Nigel eat his taquitos, and we asked where our food was. Twice. FINALLY my empanadas came out and I tucked in, assuming the burrito and my side dish were on their way. After I finished my empanadas we asked where the burrito and my frijoles were. Twice. finally, after a long wait the burrito came out and I had my side after I had finished everything else. Definitely don't go to this Wahaca if you have any sort of time constraint or you plan on eating with people and you all want your food at the same time.",

    "text": "Wahaca serves to fill the void of reliably acceptable Mexican food that is London's cuisine scene.In addition to a massive menu of food options (which the friendly servers will warn you are served tapas style and will arrive at your table as they're ready), their drinks list warrants some applause. Not that it's an exceptional destination if you want some mind-blowing cocktails, but I've had my fair share of acceptable margaritas and bloody marys, and they do offer my favourite brand of mezcal, too.For fiends of spicy meats, don't miss out on the pork pibil. It had my nose pores sheened with sweat beads after four or five bites. Additionally, I have a secret love affair with taco salads, and Wahaca's Sonoran salad strikes quite close to the mark. You may need to score some extra salsa to kick it up a notch, but it's a fair approximation.For a properly gluttonous night out, combine this with a trip to Rules' cocktail bar, just a few minutes' walk away. You're sure to waddle home with your belly full of lip-smacking good food and booze.",

As it is not possible to reserve spaces, it is advised to be early or expect to wait. You walk downstairs to enter the restaurant area. The food is amazing as all Wahaca is. I usually advise to share between the party in order to try as much as possible. Still, the fajitas are my favourite! I recently sent some friends who were in London on holiday here and they loved it.So, busy place, great food, nice service and top choice when looking for good food in London! Though if you are looking for a less busy place, go to the Tottenham Court Road branch. Nice, large bar area and way less busy!",

I have never had Cactus before, and I am now hesitant to order it again because it may not be as well prepared as my experience at Wahaca.My friend was also pleased as he spent several minutes contemplating the elaborate flavors as something as simple as pork tacos.The portions are small, but the point is obviously to order a few menu items to try various items. The atmosphere was upbeat and young for the most part. The staff was great as well; they were extremely helpful, energetic, and polite.

We weren't too hungry. I really like their concept of small plates, it gives you the opportunity to try different things on the menu. They have everyone covered from gluten free to vegetarian and vegan. Their food tastes really good and I love their hot sauces. They also have a selection of really tasty fruit and veggie juices along with the cocktails which looked amazing. Our lunch with 3 small plates and 2 non alcoholic drinks came up to 19\u00a3 which is really reasonable for the service and quality of food. I would definitely go to Wahaca for my Mexican fix the next time I am in London.",

    "text": "Yes this is England, but this was the worst Mexican I've ever had.First lets start with the food. We got the Chips and Guacamole. I can't tell you how bad the Guacamole was. \u00a0It was brown (which Guacamole tends to do unless you know how to make proper). \u00a0It tasted like....nothing. There was some flavor to it, but it was dull and it certainly not Guacamole. It also was CRAZY tiny amount and they provided about 3 times the amount of chips to eat with said dip. Biggest disappointment of the night.We also ordered the black bean side (Frigoles). \u00a0Again the taste was really off. \u00a0Almost like soap was a main ingredient. I dipped the chips in it because I had to eat something, but I stopped because eww.As for our mains. \u00a0My wife got the Sweet Potato Taquitos. \u00a0It was OK but not very Mexican, and super saucy. \u00a0I got the Steak Tacos with Grilled Cheese and Salsa. \u00a0For my tacos, there was no salsa. \u00a0The grilled cheese (which I didn't realize when I ordered said grilled) is like that little bit of a grilled cheese sandwich where a little of it lands on the pan and dries itself out to a tasteless crispy bit. \u00a0You don't throw it away cause it's cheese and eat it, but it's not good. \u00a0That's fine for a sandwich but you don't top a taco with it. \u00a0The beef and seasoning was OK.The tacos were also really small and too simple. \u00a0I am one that believes authentic Mexican tacos should be just a corn soft tortilla (x2) with a good marinated meat, and very few simple toppings (usually including a few onions, fresh coriander, avocado slice, and a lime slice). \u00a0This really had none of those, just a single tiny tortilla, a little bit of meat, and only 1-3 tiny diced onions. \u00a0Way too minimal by Mexican standards, and way too small by any standards.As for some that say this is Mexican Street Food, there's nothing that speaks street food to me. \u00a0The main Mexican Street Food item is corn on the cob, grilled, with a bit of Mayo and Queso Fresco and Spices, or delicious marinated meat grilled. \u00a0Tacos, Tostados, and Taquitos aren't really street food (Maybe Quesadillas). Lastly was the service which was just as bad. \u00a0We got there on a Saturday night. \u00a0The line was decent. \u00a0We stood there and finally the hostess came by and asked that the two groups in front of us, ourselves, and a group behind us were all 2 person groups. \u00a0We could see behind us there were 3 tables of 2 people empty. \u00a0We could also see several other table beyond of 2 people that were empty. \u00a0Maybe she didn't see them, but she just stood there looking out. \u00a0Finally randomly she takes one couple and seats them. \u00a0There's another 2 person table in the area still empty, but she comes back and just stands there while the rest of us wait. \u00a0The other couples are commenting how other 2 person tables just sit and wait.She finally takes a couple in the quieter area toward the front to sit them. We can all see how there are 2 extra 2 person table sitting there with no one at them. She must see she can sit us all now right? Nope, she comes back and just stands there. \u00a0We wait several more minutes and she finally sit us. \u00a0We sit in a busy loud portion and there's yet again another 2 person table. We know the people behind us are 2 people and they get sat there about 10 minutes later! It's been open for forever, but nothing. I get if you don't know a table is open, but when you sit one customer next to it, and not the next customer that's intentional or just lazy and we saw that happen a couple times.After sitting down we knew what we wanted right away, but it tools about 15+ minutes until anyone showed up (after I gave a stink eye across the place to a waiter). \u00a0He took our order. \u00a05 minutes later my main dish and the chips and guac showed. \u00a0OK....wrong order. \u00a0I didn't eat since it would be rude, and my wife's bean side dish showed up and finally our beers. The waitress said enjoy your meal, and my wife said well I don't have mine yet. She said well the kitchen is busy and her's will be out (ok, but bring the beer, chips, and guac first then). \u00a0A bit later her Taquitos finally came and the rest...well we just should have turned around and left when we were waiting to get a table for 30 minutes that should have honestly only taken them 5 minutes to do.Never........again.....Also, Whaca...it's spelled Oaxaca. \u00a0Us Americans get a hard time for simplifying other languages, but you really need to dumb down Oaxaca?",

    "text": "Wahaca - a Mexican place so funky that they don't take bookings - prides itself on being Mexican Market style-eating but yet being cool and stylish. It was clear that this has been a winning formula for the venue with lines often nearly out the door and the restaurant, tonight at least, very buzzy. Located in Covent Garden the restaurant, once you get downstairs, was surprisingly gigantic. As with Wagamama the food arrives as it is cooked (which is nice to know that you're getting it fresh) so you're not guaranteed that it will come in any order but when it does arrive, and if you order enough of it, expect it to fill your table. You can go for the Wahaca selection which, for \u00a319.50 gets you a selection of Wahaca's favourites (about 10 various quesadillas/tacos and taquitos plus slaw and salsas) which I reckon would be enough to fill you. We decided to go a la carte as we also wanted to get some other non-standard dishes such as the main-sized Pork Pibil. We ordered what I thought was reasonable for two people but ended up being way more than I could finish. The chorizo, thyme & potato quesadillas were my favourite dish followed by steak taco. I'm sure I would have appreciated the melt-in-your-mouth pork pibil but was too busy recovering from mistakenly eating the hottest chilli I've eaten to date to really get into it. Service, although very friendly and helpful, was a bit rubbish on the night we went. It was slow and often it was difficult to find where our waiter had gone. More often than not he had disappeared to the other side of the room. We didn't mind too much but I think if we'd been in a rush we might have been a bit p'd off. Overall Wahaca is a fun place to come to try Mexican food in quite a lively atmosphere. The offerings are tasty and with fresh ingredients. Price are also fairly reasonable. If someone has hated Mexican food in the past I would definitely take them to Wahaca to see if you can change their mind. Oh - and another thing that differentiates Wahaca is the offering of chilli seeds in match like books. Nice.",

    "text": "I was inspired to write this review after recently visiting an awful tourist trap of a 'Mexican' restaurant called Lupita that can only be described as the most god awful food I have ever eaten in my life. The whole way through I kept thinking 'Wahaca do this so much better' and wishing I was there. I have lived in London for 5 years and Wahaca is still my favourite restaurant...I could rave about this place all day long. Whether you are a tourist or a regular, the food is consistently amazing and the staff exceptional. You can't book, but don't let this put you off. If you turn up and they don't have tables, you can have one of the amazing cocktails by the bar (Wahaca Mule is the best) or they will give you a buzzer if you want to go elsewhere that will go off when your table is ready. I have almost eaten my way through the menu by this point and can recommend pretty much EVERYTHING. Start by ordering the guac and chips, you won't regret it as they're both home-made. If it's your first time then maybe go for the reasonably priced Wahaca selection to try a few of the tapas dishes. If you're feeling more adventurous then go for one of the huge burritos or the chicken mole, which has a million different flavours. My favourite small dishes are the pork pibil tacos, black bean and cheese quesadillas and chicken taquitos. As for sides...the frijoles are made with black beans and are amazing, as is the green rice, as is the spicy slaw. For afters get the churros - best I've ever had and wash it down with a fresh mint tea...there really is nothing better. You seriously cannot go wrong with this place. It's British produce at its best with really fresh ingredients made into some of the most flavoursome Mexican inspired dishes I've ever tasted. I urge everyone to go here.",

The booking system is a bit of a pain - you have to present yourself at the restaurant and they will tell you what time to come back for a table. In spite of this, the staff at Wahaca on the Friday night we went were happy, efficient and helpful. Brownie points all round. The margaritas are superb, as is the guacamole, although there wasn't enough of it! The fish pastor tacos were tasty, the nopalitos delicious, Monsieur rated his enchilada highly (it certainly didn't stay on the plate long!) and the ceviche was melt-in-mouth. The green rice was simply flavoured with coriander and I only wish we hadn't had to race off to the cinema. I could easily have stayed for churros and another margarita. I take away one star for the annoying booking procedure and the fact they don't have a bar to wait at (could make them a lot of money if they had!). Otherwise, fantastic food. We will be back.",

    "text": "Mexico without the Mexicana A visit to Wahaca is not a visit to a more typical Mexican (or, that poor imitation, Tex Mex) restaurant. There are none of the sombreros, worn cowboy boots, dusty guitars, or any other such tat. Instead, there are plain tables populating a massive basement restaurant, bustling with waiters and conversation, food smells and laughter. The menu is the table cover, simple and effective. The service is swift and helpful, enthusiastic and professional. The atmosphere is friendly, relaxed and gratified. The food is market-bought, fresh and bursting with flavour. The food is more than that though - it is, rightly, the star of the show. Everything else could be awful, and Wahaca would still have its queues. For any one of the items that regularly star on the changing menus, Wahaca would be worth repeated visits. The mole tacos alone deserve their own restaurant, the crab tamalas could have been freshly caught and made on a Canc\u00fan beach mere seconds before. The slow-cooked pork drips with more flavour, and the salsa verde is more piquant than any other London rival produces. Even basic table dishes like the salsa and the guacamole make the meal. For all of these strengths, Wahaca has one real weakness. It is far too cheap. They could charge twice the amount, and the only thing they'd lose would be the hour-plus peak-time queues. Right now managing to get a table for 12.30 or 7.00 is no longer merely a challenge, and instead more of a sport - and one with plenty of spectators. But I hope they don't change any part of their formula - there's nothing better to get you out of the house and taking part in a sport than the promise of delicious food afterwards.",

    "text": "Wahaca is very centrally located in London, in Covent Garden. The restaurant is very informal and is based the concept of Mexican market eating. They have a very good selection of drinks, including Mexican beer and tequila. Most of the portions are fairly small, so you should order about 3 each, more if you're hungry. However I can only say that the food was absolutely first class, not too spicy but with a good kick to it. The only bad point was that our waitress was not very friendly. The Mexican doughnuts or churros, with chocolate sauce is delicious",

We went with a group of 10 and, although we had to wait for over an hour to be seated, were served without any of the problems some places have with larger groups. The wait was, in a way, good though, as we were able to have a drink and look through the menu and decide what we wanted. I can't say I have a favourite dish, as everything I've tried has always been great. I do love the sweet potato wedges though, along with the mole. Added to that, the chilli seeds you get to take have actually grown, giving me some lovely chillis for my own versions...",

Anyway, had more luck going for Sunday lunch this weekend - we got a table straight away. The restaurant is light and spacious inside with tables of various heights and sizes with modern contemporary feel. The idea of the menu is that its Mexican market food - you have can have a little taste of everything. For a more traditional approach you can order your own meal but wheres the fun in that? We ordered a tasting platter and a couple of extra dishes on top and all were yummy. My particular fave was the cheese and chorizo quesedillas. The dessert was also sublime - mexican donuts, light covered in sugar with a cup of melted chocolate on the side to dip them in! The restaurant was set up my former Masterchef winner Thomasina Myers but unlike other celeb chef restaurants the prices here surprisingly reasonable with most dishes priced at \u00a33.50 - \u00a34.50. Our waiter was good fun and steered us knowledgebly through the menu. All in all a definite winner and will be going back!",

Feeling like a Mexican treat to take our minds away from the gloomy weather, we trekked towards our destination with high hopes. \u00a0We were seated immediately and got our noses into the menu in a flash. Everything sounded great, and since they suggest 2-3 plates per person we had lots of decisions to make. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tostadas, taquitos, quesadillas and the list goes on. \u00a0I shared the pork pibil tacos, chicken & chipotle quesdillas and a steak burrito. The flavour was nice, the fresca hibiscus water was refreshing and the service was quick and friendly. Unfortunately for those of us who have ventured to Mexico, Wahaca has anglicized its name and well as its food. Dining was an all round pleasant experience but nothing to rave about.",

We shared a bunch of street food, and I would definitely recommend this. And the best bit? The Churros with chocolate sauce at the end!

Chicken taquitos were crisp and flavorful though. Black beans and rice came in an extraordinarily small bowl - come on guys, beans and rice are super cheap!",

When we ate there today we were trying to work out just what it is in them that tastes so good. The beans. And the rice. And the marinated chicken. And the actual wraps are delicious... Pretty much everything, then. Service is always friendly and the atmosphere is really buzzy. Even though it's always packed, they never rush you out. And the pricing is so reasonable - you can leave stuffed for a meal that costs just \u00a310 / head. Where else can you say that about in Covent Garden?

    "text": "Call this one of those really enthusiastic three star reviews, because though I like Wahaca a whole lot, it still falls in the A-OK range... and that's oddly part of the charm.Seven of us headed here after a particularly long work day. It was 10:30pm. We were tired, a bit dishevelled and all we wanted to do was eat ourselves into a food coma and try not to fall asleep in the Uber home... Wahaca was the perfect solution for the evening. They won't be winning any service awards any time soon (it oddly took 15 minutes and three staff members to get ONE beer) but they dished up decent Mexican food, at a decent price, at 10:30pm. You really can't fault that.We each had 3-4 of the smaller plates a piece and all left stuffed to the eyeballs. I tip the hat to the smokey cauliflower dish and the duck special in particular. Plus, they have good guac. All in all, they check off every requirement for tasty late night noms.",

What probably bumped it up from a 3 to a 4 star is that the environment is so fun and the restaurant has really great energy. The staff are all very knowledgable about the food and they are really great to interact with. The reason that will probably keep me from coming back again is that I think it is a bit of a rip off.The drinks are overpriced and filled to the brim with ice (although they were delicious). My parents split a bottle of wine and felt that something was off about it. They were out of salsa (pretty strange for a Mexican restaurant) and they brought us guacamole instead...it was delicious, but also annoying that it only came with about 10 chips. \u00a0The tapas style are way too expensive for too little food. Overall everything was quite delicious but it just did not seem worth the price tag, so if you have money to throw around than I would recommend this place!",

After 10 minutes we were offered a table with another couple - only downside really as an Englishman I found this a tad awkward. Our waitress was lovely and attentive if a bit rushed off her feet and the open windows really allowed a lot of air to circulate through the restaurant on a mild summers evening. The food itself was very good, I can only imagine some of the margins they have on the products though. The broccoli dish was delicious of course but quite overpriced. My favourite dish of the evening was the Sweet Potato Taquitos (we decided to be a fat and ordered it again). Oh and the cocktails were glorious as well. I would recommend the Gin Sling (our waitresses favourite). We didn't go for dessert as we had already stuffed ourselves full so I can't comment on that but I plan to in the future....Overall very good food, lovely service and a cool, relaxed atmosphere for a Saturday Summer evening on Southbank. I will definitely be returning.",

I can certainly see why they liked the place, it is affordable, cheerful and better than almost all of the similarly-priced places in this part of town and many of the more expensive ones, for that matter. I can also understand the Mexican Wagamama thing that many people have said here on Qype. My problem with Wahaca is that the food is just underwhelming. There are some fantastic Mexican places in this city, and Wahaca can't compete with them. The food is barely spiced, the alcohol selection is pathetic (where are the rest of the Mexican beers? Why is most of the wine Chilean when Argentine malbec and lots of Californian stuff goes like a treat with Mexican?) and the sizes of side portions are mean - we paid \u00a32 for little more than a ramekin of frijoles when for that price many of London's taquerias would be drowning you in the stuff. As I said at the beginning though, Wahaca can compete with many of the places in the area, and I expect I will be going back - not when I fancy Mexican food, but when I would like a break from the likes of Wagamama and Pizza Express.",

This is a perfect London dining experience \u00a0when a new place opens, this is how you hope you'll feel when you exit. The atmosphere is incredibly sociable. Groups of varying sizes all find the feel conducive to their lively chit chat and the share share nature of the dishes goes further to enhance this vibe. Everything we ordered (and this was a lot) was supremely delicious. The guacamole was sublime, quasedillas dreamy, even the tortilla chips were as far away from a Dorito as you can imagine. Unlike some reviewers, my wait was not long at all \u00a0the queue looked pretty extensive, but moved quickly. Once seated, our waitress was really friendly and just the right amount of attentive.

Supposedly served street style, they have enough little plates to share amongst friends, tapas style with plenty of flavour and enough variety to impress even the fussiest of diners. My favourite dish here is the pork pibil. Even though it's a main dish, the pork is super soft, tender, and filled with flavour. It's smoky, spicy and juicy since it's wrapped in a paper bag to keep the moisture in. Service is variable and sometimes inattentive, but on the whole is a great experience.",

For some reason I had imagined this restaurant to be small - I think because I had heard it was canteen style with a street food menu - but Wahaca is HUGE. And a good job too..even at 4pm on a Friday it was busy and my friend said she hadn't ever seen it without a queue. The food is Mexican but not as you will know it - don't expect huge plates of cheesy deep fried nastiness here. There are some familiar entries on the menu such as nachos (which come with a guacamole or salsa), burritos and of course Mexican beers. I'd guarantee you will also find a few things you wouldn't see on the menu of Chili's or Chiquito's like Cactus Salad, tortilla soup and green rice. The format is pretty simple, there are two styles of eating - either mix and match from the street food and sides and share with your friends (like tapas), or go for a bigger plate like a burrito or a salad. We chose to pick and mix with the street food and chose some great dishes like the aforementioned cactus salad served on a crispy tortilla, and some great mushroom quesadillas. With beer and nachos and full to the brim the meal came to \u00a340. A bargain for such good quality food in such a great environment. A real experience, highly recommended.",

Though it's not quite authentic mexican food, it still tastes excellent, very fresh, and the price is reasonable, the beer and the tequila are great and the space is really nice, good young energetic vibe. The presentation is good, the service is good, the location is excellent. Can't really complain except sometimes it takes a while to get in there. Plus the guacamole is excellent and the pico de gallo is really good (could be a little more fresh, the tomato didn't look so good, but the taste was right). Their salsas (green and red) are both really good too.",

It recently won an award from the Observer for its food and every time I've tried to visit there's been a long queue and I've been turned away disappointed. But on Saturday things were different. We turned up early and managed to get a table in what looks remarkably like a Mexican version of Wagamama's. I decided to go for the grilled fish of the day rather than snacking on the little tapas-like antojitos on offer. This was a decision I came to regret, not I hasten to add, because the sea bass was horrible, but because all the people sitting around me seemed to be eating even more delicious food! Ah well. You always want what you haven't got! Anyway, food-wise I can't really fault Wahaca. It's freshly prepared, arrives quickly and provides an interesting alternative to the chain restaurant offerings bunched around Covent Garden. My only criticism is that at times the service, although charming, sometimes bordered on the over efficient . When I finished my main course, the plates were whisked away within seconds and replaced with the bill. I felt pressured to vacate my table immediately. I suppose the staff wanted to fill my table with two eager people in that long queue!",

The staff are friendly, service is prompt and the food is fresh in this restaurant run by past Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers. It is well situated just at the bottom edge of Covent Gardens, making it a very convenient choice if you don't mind nipping to a local drinking establishment whilst you wait for a table to become available. Food has a feel of being well prepared and is always presented very nicely. The main idea here is to order lots of food and share out the goodies, this is not a difficult challenge since the food here is actually very cheap for what you get. Check it out if you get the chance, definitely worth a look.",

I've been to Oaxaca in Mexico (the city that the restaurant was named after, but the owners spelt it differently so that word would spread more easily!) and this restaurant definitely serves authentic Mexican. Choose from the great 'Street Food' menu, which serves smaller, interesting dishes that you order several of to share, or the main dishes menu, which are equally delicious and you can keep all to yourself! The restaurant has funky decor and an informal lively atmosphere, with music playing quite loud and really friendly waiters. The food comes as soon as it's ready, so you do end up eating at slightly different times. It's not necessarily a 'first date' kind of place, but it's excellent for a group of friends wanting a fun night out with great food and tasty cocktails!",

Wahaca serves Mexican street food, including the 'mole' a famous chocolate savoury dish (not for everyone). If you fancy something different, with an informal atmosphere, this is a great place to try. They don't take reservations, so just turn up and queue for a table. If they are very busy, they will take your name and number and call you when a table is ready- so that you can get a drink at a bar nearby instead of queuing. Check out the website for the menu, but it is all nice! The drinks- including margaritas are very nice too. For the food you get, this place is great value. You can choose many small items, tapas style or get one of the larger items, but because of the informal atmosphere, it's great to share and try each others food! The d\u00e9cor is bright and cheery- with an industrial edge. Great fun.",

Unlike some restaurants I've been where they use the same 'veggie mix' for every item, this menu was curated to be diverse and delicious! The atmosphere is chill and happy with attentive table service which can be hard to find in London. A definite recommend and will be returning next time!",

Unfortunately one of these things here was the tacos :(. I was craving it so much that i was decided to dine in as table for one. (Sad face) but whatever the food was delicious!! I ordered the chicken tacos and he cheesy cauliflowers. Mmmmmmmm my mouth is watering thinking about it. They even have an app that lets you pay your bill without having to flag your waiter down.

The colorful and abstract decorations are what caught my eye at first and as I did some digging, I found out their food was right up my alley as well. They have bigger plate options, along with smaller portions (which I enjoy, so you can order a little of everything and try more of the menu).My boyfriend and I started off with the Guacamole and Chips (and beer) to settle our \"just off an 8 hour flight hangry arguments\". As we started munching on those and throwing back some Modelo we began laughing, realizing how much we both get grumpy when we need food (WHO DOESN'T?). We quickly started deciphering the menu and contemplating what we should order/split. This is where the server came in handy.. He broke down the menu for us and told us some of his favorites. My bf chose the 3 Grilled British Steak tacos, which had an impressive amount of flavor for such small tacos and the way they cooked the meat made it melt in your mouth. I went with the Ancho Chicken Tacos; I would highly recommend these to anyone who doesn't know which menu item to get. The marinated meat and the sauce coincided very well together, not to mention the flavor of pickled carrots. I would have ordered way more, but we were trying to not get overwhelmingly full right off the bat. The food and atmosphere are something you won't want to miss out on... definitely bring your appetite and camera!",

Don't get me wrong, there are some hidden gems within the menu but overall I see Wahaca as a means to an end, not somewhere I would crave to go. We headed to the Wahaca by Covent Garden after a long day. Food was most definitely needed and I was happy to head for some tacos and guaca. NOM.The menu is extensive and food authentic. I actually really enjoyed the food this week, in particular the slow-cooked brisket tacos which were tender and came with a flavoursome sauce which had a subtle kick.I must say that the service wasn't great. My colleague was waiting approximately 15 minutes for a beer and we had to ask a number of times for it to arrive at the table. The waitress was friendly but for the amount of staff in the restaurant we shouldn't have been waiting as long as we did. I would definitely recommend Wahaca as a place to grab a bite, it's reliable and satisfying, but little more.",

One person in our party had finished his 4 dishes before one of us had received any of hers.I like the concept, but it's not cheap enough for the execution to be so rusty.",

Can't book before hand so we had to wait and we had to wait for the majority to arrive to end up getting a table that stayed free for as long as we were there.It has a buzzing atmosphere and certain staff are always more enthusiastic than others but I could never get one's attention when I needed it.The tortillas were quite oily so we didn't even finish it. The staggered arrival of food based on when it was ready meant waiting for others so my tacos became soggy and not very nice. So when the food arrives, eat. Waiting is not that great.",

Surely no one goes to Wahaca expecting an authentic Mexican experience, but if you can just put that out of your head and go for a tasty meal, you should leave satisfied.We had a half dozen things between us, things we've had before mainly. I had a couple of problems - the corn wasn't as good as last time I had it, last summer. The actual quality of the ingredients was good and it was cooked well, but there wasn't enough flavouring on it. The steak tacos weren't all the same - one was missing its guacamole. And the sweet potato side was quite meagre, and again, not as flavourful as normal.The staff were friendly though, and service was quick and we left satisfied for under \u00a330 for 2 people. For the location, that's not too shabby.",

Surprisingly, the buttermilk chicken tacos were incredible. They left us wanting more. I would definitely suggest getting a couple kinds of tacos and splitting the plates around the table -- picking an array of tacos for one is unfortunately not at an option. Decided against the pre-fixed selection for two given that not everything on the list looked appealing. Man two tables down ordered a burrito. It looked good. Looked better than my pork tacos. The chips were not crunchy enough and slightly too thick, but the guac was good. Passion fruit margaritas went down easily and quickly! However, \"two shots of tequila\" might be an over exaggeration. Would go again.",

    "text": "The friend who encouraged me to go to Wahaca with her last week sold me on the strength of her passion for their frijoles - I figured anywhere who excels in such a simple dish as black beans must be pretty great at other Mexican dishes too! I spent a week in DF earlier in the year and as a veggie can categorically state that Wahaca offers a great deal more options for non-meateaters than anywhere I ate in Mexico City. Everything's also cooked far more healthily and vegetables are present! I found it very hard to choose from the inviting menu but eventually settled on the aforementioned frijoles (superb), broad bean and feta quesadillas (sublime) and summer vegetable burrito (so-so). I wasn't mad keen on the burrito because I felt the filling was too fussy - I'd much rather have had straightforward fajita veg, guacamole, salsa and regular cheese than courgette, tomatoes, spinach, tarragon and mint. It sounds lovely but just didn't do it for me. I'm very keen on going back to try the nopalitos (cactus) because I adored that in all the forms I tried it in DF, and will happily stick to the street food section of the menu for future visits and leave the burritos to places like Chilango (qype.co.uk/place/512244-\u2026) . The Wahaca experience was complete when upon leaving we were presented with matchbook-like packets of chillis to plant at home - can't wait to give that a go!",

There is not such thing, the right spelling is Oaxaca, and it's a province in Mexico that is known for the amazing food. So with a bit of scepticism I gave it a try. We where there on a Wednesday night and it was so full, we had to wait and hour to get our table. But it gave me a chance to scrutinize the food. I must say it's as proper Mexican as you can get in London. The have my favourite Mexican beer Pacifico, and the amazing Centenario tequila. Try and have one of each when you go. Tacos where really good, with fresh corn tortillas, and salsas where fresh and spicy. It was like being home!I highly recommend this place, just be aware you might have to wait in queue for a while.",

Starter drinks were brought nearly immediately and even as the place filled up we never had to wait long for refills. Our food also arrived quickly and was quite fresh and tasty. It's definitely not oily Tex-Mex. We got a couple of the street-food dishes each plus a side salad, and that was plenty of food for us. The little dishes of red and green salsa they brought us were delicious and allowed you to add extra heat to your dishes if you wanted. Total came to \u00a344 for three people including several alcohol and non-alcohol drinks each. We were quite happy with the whole experience and value and it is nice to find somewhere where much of the menu is gluten-free.",

Nestled in the Covent Garden area, Wahaca's unimposing front gives way to a huge basement restaurant with a nice bar and open kitchen. The atmosphere is one of busy excitement and the dining area is full of couples, business partners, and ladies sipping their margaritas. If you like tequila, check out the pretty extensive tequila menu and make sure to have a few of their margaritas. They come in different flavors that are all really tasty. My boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of small plates and shared them. We got mole tostadas, chorizo quesadillas, quesa fundita, chips and salsa, and pulled pork tacos. Everything was excellent and bursting with flavor, not to mention great presentation. My favorite was the chorizo and potato quesadillas, make sure and dip them in their chipotle and habanera sauce; it makes for a delicious sweet/spicy combination. I liked Wahaca so much I wish there were one back in the States! Maybe someday.",

    "text": "Un-pretentious, lively, great food, great tequila and great value!! We've been planning on eating at Wahaca on our next visit to London, so on Saturday took our place in the queue at the top of the stairs. 10 minutes later we had reached the bottom and were told the current waiting times were just under an hour - it's a Saturday night so we couldn't complain. Instead we nipped around the corner for a few cocktails and returned to Wahaca shortly after. Whilst we waited for a table to become available, we chose a few drinks from the tequila menu. Tequila's not a spirit I've ever drank correctly so was pleased when the bartender offered to talk me through the options, it was really appreciated and I've found myself a new drink to explore! On being seated, our waitress (Ania) talked us through the menu and snacked on nacho's whilst we waited for the food to arrive. The nacho's were really good, nice and crunchy compared to the fragile thin ones you'd get from a supermarket. Not sure whether wahaca buy them in or make them but they were nice all the same. When the food arrived (a selection of tacos, tostadas and an enchilada) both my fianc\u00e9e and I took a bite and said wow. The meat in the tacos was marinated, shredded and packed full of flavour. I did ruin my taco's slightly by adding some of the fantastic South Devon Chilli Company Habanero sauce - I loved the flavour, but it was a little too runny which made the taco soggy. Maybe I should have dipped instead of poured? The tacos/tostadas/etc themselves are fairly small, maybe two or three bites per item but with three (tacos) it's not an issue. Just make sure you follow the guidelines of ordering 2-3 dishes per person. There is a sharing platter (for 2) too which works out fantastic value for money, but does limit your choice slightly. In total, the bill with drinks came to under \u00a340 for two of us which for good food, great atmosphere in the centre of London I certainly can't (and won't) complain. All the staff I encountered were friendly, lively and seemed genuinely pleased to be at work. I absolutely want to go back and eat again, with so much choice I feel it's my duty to tastebuds!",

You can even arrange for a little hand-brushing over a plate of shared enchiladas. Even if there is just two of you, I would recommended two guacamole starters--you'll be surprised how much you can load on just one chip. You can't go wrong with the rest of the menu, but if you're not a big spicy food fan, I would consult with your waiter about what you might enjoy best. As this is more fast food, \"street food\" dining, same goes, you can stay for as long or as little as you'd like--though the buzzers at the front door indicate how crowded the restaurant gets. There is a decent enough selection of imported beers and some yummy mixed drinks to keep you occupied, if you must wait.",

    "text": "We dined at Wahaca tonight as an attempt to try somewhere new and exciting. Arriving at 8.30 as expected we had to wait until 9.30 to be seated. The man in control of tables seemed organised though and we felt like he would actually ring us if our table became avaliable earlier as promised. We shared the street food for 2 dish. I really like the Chicken rolls and the steak tacos. Also black beans on the side was yum. For dessert I tried the mango sorbet and it was a lovely large portion. The margeritas were small but good tasting and the hisbiscus water was refreshing.",

    "text": "I can't figure out if I liked this place. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would. The service was excellent for the most part; prompt, friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. But it's not really Mexican food, is it. It's what you would expect a winner of Masterchef to interpret Mexican food as. But let's set that aside for a minute and talk about the experience in isolation. The menu is very well designed and thoughtfully laid out to give novices all the information they need without patronizing regulars. The waiter compared the street food section to tapas, which is a good way of describing it. Appetizer-sized portions of tacos, quesedillas, taquitos, etc, etc are good for sharing amongst friends. The bigger bites section has the usual burritos, enchiladas, etc. My char-grilled steak burrito had cabbage and pickled onions in ita hearty WTF to that. But, it was reasonably tasty and well constructed. I was a bit disappointed with the beer selection - only Corona and Modelo (both Especial and Negro) for Mexican beer. No Dos Equis, no Mexicali, no Sol, and no Tecate. I think this place can be characterized as a gateway Mexican restaurant - definitely not what you'd find on the streets of Guadalajara but a great way to get acquainted with the flavors and lingo. The food was fresh, well prepared, and attractively served. Give it a try, but don't bother waiting in line - there's better ways to spend your time.",

    "text": "Having been craving proper Mexican street food since a visit to the real thing last year, this place definitely ticked the boxes for me! We were served up with a mouthwatering selection of taquitos, quesadillas and tacos accompanied by two really distinctive types of salsa and some habanero chili sauce to ramp up the heat if desired. All very fresh and colourful, with my particular favourites being the spicy pork tacos, chorizo and cheese quesadillas and unusual but really great broad bean and feta taquitos. Our waitress was friendly and upbeat, and service was nice and quick without being rushed. The atmosphere was just right for an informal dinner - quite relaxed, modern and airy but with the occassional rustic touch and a big open kitchen so you can see all the action. Definitely recommended.",

What we got was the selection for two, and me and my boyfriend were both more than satisfied and surprised by the mixture of different flavours. For anybody who wants to get a taste of their great varieties, I would suggest to go for that dish. The cocktails they offer are worth their price and their tequilas are really different from the crap you get in normal bars. The staff was great, every two minutes somebody was around and asked if we needed something. Only minus-point for me was that I sat at a place without a backrest so after we dined there for over an hour I had a bit of a backache. Though there was still quite a queue waiting for tables nobody hurried us to finish up or gave us any pressure to leave, an experience i made in other restaurants before. Wahaca will see us for sure again; it is a very lively place, and I would not suggest to go there with bigger groups as this will be quite a wait to get a table, but for two people it is a perfect place to go on a date.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying that I lived and worked in Mexico for a year, Baja California to be exact, so unlike some other reviewers here I know what Mexican food tastes like. Not Mexican food in America (which I've eaten and can be delicious!) or Mexican food in other parts of London (which was generally revolting) but Mexican food cooked by Mexican people, in Mexico.Phew! Now that rant's over let me tell you that Wahaca is great. While we're lacking a few key ingredients in the UK, and there are a few strange fusion style dishes on the menu, to me it tasted genuinely like the Mexican food I knew and loved. The dishes were just the right, and genuinely authentic size, perfect for mix and matching, and they were light, bright, and fresh.The service is a little sketchy with dishes coming out as they're made which can make for an awkward dinner if you're with a lot of people, but one of the things that makes Wahaca fun is the spontaneity of it, and the bustling atmosphere.If you're looking for a burrito stuffed with cheese and refried beans then go somewhere else, Chipotle and Chilango have these areas sewn up, but if you're looking to escape to a food stand in a busy Mexican market for a second or two, then head to Wahaca and ignore the grumpy reviews!",

    "text": "Let me start with a few facts, mainly for North American tourists looking to try some authentic Mexican food in central London. First, you will have to appreciate that Mexico is about 5,000 miles away and there is not a sizable Mexican expat population in England or historical ties. Second, there are many types of \"Mexican\" food. What many Americans think of Mexican food is usually Tex-Mex food or some other variation that is popular (i.e. loaded with cheese to suit the American palette).Now for Wahaca: great atmosphere, decent and eclectic margarita menu and lots of choice for very tasty examples of authentic Mexican flavours. Wahaca is the best you'll get in central London. If you can stand the sometimes long line to get a seat, be sure to take your time with chips & guacamole to start, two or three small main dishes --- and an absolute must, chocolate and churros to finish. Did I mention decent margarita menu? Sprinkle a few of those in there and you're set. You may not be in central Mexico and paying in pesos, but it is as good as it gets paying in pounds in Covent Garden. \u00a1Qu\u00e9 disfrute!",

It's an upscale imitation of Mexican food, so it's perfectly fine if you're just looking for a nice place to hang and eat with friends. I've said this before about Asian restaurants that I've reviewed, and it's true for Wahaca: it's decent food, but it's a poor rendition of EXPENSIVE Mexican cuisine.Besides the food, the service was good despite the fact that the place was packed. The atmosphere of the place was also hip and lively, but it bears very little resemblance to anything Mexican. If you're in London and you're craving Mexican food, you might be better off with the brand new Chipotle. Yes, you heard me. Chipotle. Cuz friend, you ain't finding a heck of a lot of taco stands in London.",

OK, so you have to queue for a table, but when you're queuing with a tequila mojito this is no bad thing! Plus we were seated within half an hour, so no biggy. And they don't rush you when you are seated, either. It's all very laid back. A slight incident occured when my dining companion picked up her (second) Wahaca Mule cocktail, only for the bottom of the glass to come off. Said Wahaca Mule went EVERYWHERE, but the staff were quick to mop it up and bring a replacement, and they took the drinks off the bill without asking, which was a welcome bonus. I'd recommend ordering 2-3 'street food' dishes per person, then tucking in and sharing everything around. YUM. I'd be interested to see what the Soho and Westfield branches are like, but the atmosphere in the flagship Covent Garden one was great.",

They have managed to take mediocre Mexican street food, inflate the price massively and sell it to trendy people who think it's all so cool. They've also sold out. It's supposed to be spelt Oaxaca but they've spelt it Wahaca so that English people can pronounce it correctly. Marketing genius for sure, but still a sell-out. If you want a Burrito or some real Tacos, skip Wahaca altogether and go to Benito's Hat, Chilango or Chipotle. If you want first class authentic Mexican food and don't mind paying a premium price for quality, go to Mestizo. If you want to be hip and trendy and be able to tell all your friends you've been to Wahaca just for the sake of being able to say it, go to Wahaca. They do have some nice drinks and a good selection of Tequila, but the menu is a little confusing and it's difficult to know what you're ordering. When it arrives, the food is not bad, but it's not great either.",

Since then I have been back a few times and damn are these guys sucky!Dear Wahaca,Okay so you are popular but seriously, you are going to make me wait at the bar STANDING for 45 minutes while a table becomes free. And no I'm not allowed to wonder off and come back? Oh okay. Erm...I'll just wait here in the corner.Right, sorry was that you shouting my name...I couldn't hear you over the 60 people chatting loudly around me as I cradle my over priced cocktail. But \u00a0have had 3 while I waited so you have just doubled my bill with drinks. Oh hold on there is a pregnant woman here but no seats so you grab her a chair and just she sits while all her friends stand around her and chat. Nice!So I get to my seat and your friendly waiter serves us and the meals come at completely different times, which is fine apart from the fact that I have finished mine and now my date has his. Oh I'm sorry you need the table...we'll leave.I won't be seeing you again soon, which is a shame as I really like your food and I heard you had Fish Tacos! Amazing!Your friend,Lizzie GSo if you come here during the day it's totally worth it, Friday or Saturday night? Make other plans this place is awful.",

I arrived at 12.30, as we were both newbies, but had been warned that it gets really busy. This turned out to be true, but we went on a Weds lunchtime, and there were tables still available throughout lunch service.I had a Circus Burst to drink (a \u00a0fizzy water concoction with mint and lime), which was beautiful and very refreshing. We shared a Wahaca Platter, whih came wth small plates of five of the best sellers: pork taco (a small circular tortilla with meat/salsa/salad on top), beef tostada (same size and concept, but the tortilla is lightly fried), mushroom tortilla (a larger tortilla filled with cheese/mushrooms, then griddled), chicken taquito (a small corn tortilla, filled with shredded meat or fresh vegetables, rolled into a narrow flute shape and lightly fried), a bean and cheese based variation of the taco above - as well as green rice and beans. Amazing! It was lovely and filling (definitely enough for two, though we ordered chips and salsa as well). Both the red and green salsa that comes ont he table when you sit down are delicious, and if you hot - and I mean HOT - sauce, try the XXX drizzle dip in a bottle as well.The best bit, we finished with coffee, I did my interview and we weren't rushed out. I don't think this would have been the case if they'd been crazy busy, but I felt relaxed enough to take my time.The bill came to \u00a330 as well. That's got to be a bargain! I'm going back with friends for some tequila next week. And I loved the 'ola@wahaca.com' email. Little touches like that really impressed me.",

A friend at work (thanks, Penny ;-) ) had recommended Wahaca as somewhere which served tasty Mexican food, had a cool and modern atmosphere and vibe, but above all else, good service. We weren't disappointed! We arrived early as we were told mid-week evenings tend to be busy and that it can be difficult to get a table at 'peak' times. We put our names on a waiting list, were told a table would be available in 20mins, ordered ourselves a Mojito and grabbed a space on the bar bench seating. It was steadily getting busier (just past 6pm on a Weds eve), but we were seated within 15mins. We were lucky enough to have the most upbeat and enthusiastic waitress who couldn't do enough for us and who really made our experience rather exceptional! Our waitress explained the different sharing options and how we could put various dishes together to share for each course, which was helpful as there are quite a few 'mezzo' style dishes to choose from. Tables are well spaced, furniture is minimalist, toilets immaculate and menus are laid-out in a similar newsletter style to Wagamamas. You can take away the menus for future ref or to pass onto folk who you think may also like to visit. Clever marketing eh?! Modern, relaxed, great service and brilliant attention to detail. Food was scrummy and great to share. Definitely a top tip for meeting-up with a pal or a group of friends.",

The first time I got some kind of summer salad, which I definitely enjoyed. The second time I got the tortilla soup with chicken. The presentation was really cool - they bring you a bowl with crushed chips, sour cream, and fixins then they pour the soup from a pitcher. The thing is, my soup took forever to come out of the kitchen (my flatmates had already plowed through two courses of mini tacos) and it was luke-warm. Also, they was about three pieces of chicken. I did enjoy the virgin-mojito type chiller, especially because it was actually cheaper than a soda. My roommates love their special margaritas (apparently made strong to match the prices) and overall this places quells our desire for south of the border cuisine.That'll do, pig. That'll do.",

When, however, you issue buzzers to clients and a number of these are on the blink at the same time, you've got a problem. On Saturday (late afternoon) we became aware of many unhappy customers waiting in line with ourselves. Eventually people were approaching the staff to ask what the problem was. It turned out at least 3 buzzers were faulty and we had indeed been 'called' already. Given that at least 2 of the groups had not moved more than a few metres from the 'reception' area ... a simply calling out of our names would have sorted the problem easily. Most concerning was the apparent lack of concern on the staff's part. One group were so tee-ed off that they left in a huff - likely never to darken the doorstep again .... plus tell all their friends. Wahaca needs to be careful of resting on it's laurels. Food was tasty and had a nice bite. Our waitress was very quick and knowledgeable; and as I've always maintained: Everyone deserves a second chance.",

We finally got to seat for dinner and have some food. Too crowed, tables too close to each other and impossible to have a civilized conversation without shouting.Three stars because of the food...I liked it and will go back on a quiet midweek day/ afternoon time....",

    "text": "Outstanding mexican restaurant just opened in Covent Garden. Prior to visiting here all my previous experiences of mexican restaurants were cacti on the walls, guacamole/sour cream smothered nachos and unidentifiable meats in wraps \"fresh\" from the microwave. All eaten whilst being hassled by an over-enthusiastic woman wearing bullet straps screaming \"tequilaaaaa\"! WAHACA COULD NOT BE FARTHER FROM THAT. Funky. modern design, the walls of the restaurant are in bright vivid blocks of colour accentuated by light boxes. The restaurant is in a basement, but with the design plus the glass frontage of the place, it feels light & airy. The food is based on mexican \"street food\", which means there are as many ways of eating as there are flavours. You can have a healthy salad lunch, light snack or antojitos (little treats) with drinks. You can share small plates with friends, or have a (massive) taco all to yourself. All the food is fresh, tasty and a million miles away from anything I've eating in the UK before. All ingredients are sourced from local, organic producers. I recommend the Fish Pastor Taco, Chorizo Tortilla & Steak Burrito. There's an extensive beers & spirits list. No surprise margueritas & mojitos feature heavily - the hibiscus marguerita is recommended. The restaurant is run by Thomasina Miers, who was winner of the BBC TV competitiion \"MasterChef\" in 2005. Service is fast & efficient and its a lively, enjoyable place to spend an evening.",

You could order two or three options from the street food menu and the dishes would come out in perfect sharing sizes usually two or three tasty sample of each dish which was fantastic because with three of us there we could basically try nearly everything on the menu.The flavours were rich and the Mexican chilli/spice/hotness (choose your own adventure with here depending on the dish) was present and just right without being too overwhelming so for me personal it was not some much a kick in the face of red hot spice but more the subtle slap in the face which added to the Mexican experience.Nice range of drinks available too.The layout of the place fits quite a crowd but you don't feel squished up next to you neighbour and whilst the noise can get loud it did not seem to drown out the person sitting a cross from me nor did I need to shout to be heard.Defiantly a place I would return too to further explore the main menu",

    "text": "I feel like I should actually give this place two ratings, if it was based in California I'd probably only give it 3 stars because the portions are small so the prices are fairly high when you take this into account. However, in London where most Mexican restaurants are awfully tacky tex-mex places with embarrassing names and terrible food, this place easily scores 5 stars. The menu includes some of my favourite mexican dishes, in a spanish style tapas form. They have the usual tacos and burritos, coupled with quesadillas and tostadas. I'd recommend anything with the steak, also the seasonal dishes are always really good.They have pretty good margaritas and a good selections of beers, which is a plus given that you'll usually have at least a 5/10 minute wait. The tortilla chips and salsa/guacamole also serve as a good starter whilst you wait for your food. Definietly the best Mexican food in London.",

I was living in London for a few years and my friends and I were constantly looking for go-to Mexican place. I'm glad to see the city has improved in it's selection, and Wahaca still remains the gold standard for Mexican fine dining (well, by Mexican food standards).I highly recommend the mushroom quessadillas and the salads. I know, I know, a salad sounds boring, but they really do pack a punch!! The quac is a bit pricey, but well worth it.The classic margarita on the rocks is my favorite, but they really do know their tequila so feel free to explore. The waits can be long, and the servers/hosts can be a bit lax, but if you press them a bit you'll have a more delightful experience. Highly recommend!",

We had a selection of dishes from the summer menu and it was great to be able to eat tapas style dishes and have so manydifferent tastes \u00a0every dish was delicious and fresh. . We tried chickenmole taco, shrimp and scallopceviche tostadas, summery new potato taquitos and broad bean and fetaquesadillas which were all fabulous. We also had a new noodle dish (completelyforgotten the name of it) \u00a0it was ok but probably the weakest dish.

We're all vegetarians, so we basically ordered everything veggie off the menu. They're also always really great at accommodating to my vegan needs.I've been to the one in the White City, and loved it. This one is loads more busy. It took about an hour to get a table (they don't let you book), but it's ok, because we had margaritas while waiting...I think I like this one better than the one in White City. The food was slightly spicier and flavourful. It's really hard to get a decent burrito/Mexican food in this town, but this is definitely the best I've had so far. I can't really say much about the meaty products, but I know all the veg stuff has lots of flavours and spices. It's not better than any hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in LA, and it's not really \"authentic\", but I give it an A+ because of the context, and it really satisfies my cravings for Mexican food until I get back to my old haunts back home.",

Yes, Wahaca's atmosphere is part of it's charm, with bright green and hot pink walls and chairs, fun music, and peppy service, however luckily, their food parallels their style. Running with a Mexican market food concept, Wahaca offers fresh, flavourful, ethically grown dishes. Expect the usual suspects like guac and chips, tacos, taquitos and burritos but not necessarily with the usual fillings. Chorizo, feta, mint, grilled British steak and unique sauces make their Street Food section ace. 4-5 of these little dishes can easily feed 2 people. Service is super fast and very friendly. Mojitos are made with tequila, and though they are not exactly cheap, they are delicious.",

Relying on those facts my first impression of Wahaca is... it's not Mexican food. It's too expensive to be Mexican food. It's too fusion-ish. Which is fine, just don't come expecting \"authentic\" Mexican food. And though my expectations weren't that high, they did okay and our food was pretty good. I like that they made their own sauces and everything is nice and warm when it comes to your table. I was sadly disappointed by the size of their street tacos though. Come on! They aren't even that small in Mexico! Admittingly, I would definitely come back because this is probably the closest I will get to anything resembling a \"street taco.\" I feel so guilty.",

I got us lost and shortly the man called us to say he had held us a table so we headed back to Wahaca. It is a large restaurant occupying the cavernous basement floor of a building between Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. The restaurant is quite noisy with almost communal seating and chatty service, which normally is fine and would suit friends, but wasn't great for being with my Dad, who is a bit traditional. Also, there was a young couple next to us having an awkward first date so perhaps avoid in that situation. We were seen quickly and are food and drinks arrived promptly too. I had a beer and a mojito, both of which were well done. I've not had proper Mexican food so I don't know how Wahaca compares in that sense. The food here was tasty, though not particularly memorable. It wasn't bad place, just not a great experience, I imagine if I were to return with friends it would be better.",
