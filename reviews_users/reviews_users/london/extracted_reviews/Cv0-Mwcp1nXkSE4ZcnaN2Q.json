    "text": "I grew up with polenta, I love polenta, I want to eat polenta all the time.I wandered past the place within a few days of opening in December. I always look at new restaurant's menus and was lured in by the VEGAN section! It looked great, but I had just eaten. So for a dessert, we went in for an espresso and a (Ms Cupcake) lemon cornmeal cookie. It was cute, good ambiance and we had a nice chat with the owner. I tried for weeks to get someone to go with me to try it out.Fast forward to March. I had the mixed mushroom polenta. It was probably 1 1/2 cups of polenta, topped with herby mushrooms. It was nice. Nice. Just nice. And I know it's Soho, but \u00a38 for a not-huge portion of polenta (the cheapest thing in the world) that I genuinely ate in 5 minutes (while talking), was a bit offensive.However, the sweet breakfast polenta sounds pretty tasty and if I'm ever in the area and needing breakfast, I would definitely go. And If I need a vegan treat and coffee, I will definitely go.But for dinner, I may skip.",

What is it about the word polenta that makes people so reluctant?!But I know that polenta done right is an absolute delight. And I was indeed delighted!Its got a low key interior, a nice woody combination of minimal and hipster. The menu is short and simple, and on the recommendations of other yelp reviews I ordered the polenta with aubergine.We did have the little bite things to start with, but they really were so small and pointless. Not even a mouthful! Save yourself for the main event and dessert I reckon.And the main event indeed... Such a textural delight! Creamy. Grainy. Fluffy. And the the aubergine was spot on too- I was so impressed. Clean flavours, fresh... I was quiet for most of my plate which was a real occurrence! My companion had something meaty and was equally impressed. I had dessert and went for the chocolate brownie (and that lasted 0.7 seconds- squishey and intense).The service was efficient and friendly, we had some jokes with our server, and the prices were reasonable. Ideal date spot for friends with dietary requirements. I will definitely be going back again!",

I finally made a reservation for dinner and wow I was definitely not disappointed! I had the gnocchi with truffle cheese and wow it was delicious! Others I was dining with had the pork (which was very well received) and the salmon gnocchi which was a different gnocchi than the truffle cheese one. All was absolutely delicious, and I was well impressed. The desserts certainly shined also - chocolate cheesecake ... delicious! The only complaint I have was the bread which was hard and crumbley... it was pretty hard to eat but the waiter apologised profusely, omitted it from the bill and said it was supposed to be a soft focaccia. I'm not sure what had gone wrong with it, but nevertheless, not enough to deter me... i'll be back to try the past and give the bread another go! Delicious!",

    "text": "I don't know why but I expected better from La Polentaria. It's a simple concept and should be easy to pull off but there was something just plain bland and boring about it. The service was fine and the waiter was very friendly, keeping us mildly entertained with little jokes. The waitress who brought us our drinks thought it a little strange when I wanted to pour some of the wine myself, but I get a little uncomfortable when they pour it for a group of people.We didn't try any of the starters as we were all happy to go straight for a main. Between us we tried, I think, six different items. I had the Wild Boar which was ok but the signature item, the polenta, was a stodgy mess at the bottom of the plate. My wife had the pasta and ragu which was bland even with a liberal coating of salt. She couldn't finish it so I had a little of it and I can honestly say I've had better at Bella Italia. The others at my table had things like the Sausages and beans, steak and chicken. I tried a little of my friends chicken dish and it was overpowered by the smoked cheese in the centre.While we were there I bumped into an old friend who was with three friends. She sent me a message later on telling me that they thought the food was \"gross\". Not exactly a ringing endorsement!The only pluses that I found here was the waiter was entertaining and the house wines were very tasty.I won't be returning but don't let me put you off. Give it a go and see if you have a better time of it!",

You can start the meal with mini baked polenta with toppings (like blinis!). These were reasonably tasty, but nothing too exciting.The main event was... good but didn't wow me. The polenta is cooked well and definitely the best I ever had but the toppings were a little bland. Another issue was that the menu didn't offer any side dishes. It would have been nice to get some vegetables to go along with the meal.The puddings had yet more polenta in! A decent polenta, almond and lemon cake.I enjoyed my visit here, but I kinda feel once you've done it once why do it again? The dishes won't change - as it's name states it's all about polenta!",

Most restaurants in London did an okay job at having gluten-free / milk-free options but this place by far served one of the most tasty meals during my two weeks. I had the Pollo alla Romana and the Rocket with fennel, green beans, oranges and olives, and topped it off with a brownie. They also had a lot of vegan options. The owners very friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was bright and comfortable. Having been spoiled by New York City and San Francisco cuisine, this measured right up to what you would find in either of those cities. Again, not so of a lot of places I ate in London, living up to the American stereotype that British food is often not very good and completely over-priced. Also, Time Out has them listed under Chinatown area but it's really much closer to Covent Garden and Soho, one block from Shaftesbury Avenue.",

The bad thing was that it was one at the entrance so it was cold, dark and draughty all the time. Plus there was always somebody standing beside us asking for a free table. I really hope that these tables are not for normal reservations. The food we had was good, small portions and high priced. We knew this in advance and ordered 2 courses. Our favourites where the lamb meatballs with grilled butternut squash and, much to my surprise, the pink ravioli stuffed with gorgonzola cheese and beetroot, topped with pistachio and rocket pesto. After an hour we felt too uncomfortable to stay any longer so we left with some good food in our bellies.",

It's just that good.For appetizers we had focaccia with Parma ham and the butternut squash flan with a parmesan cheese sauce. \u00a0They were both repeats, but the flan won hands down. \u00a0We have never had flan as an appetizer and don't even like flan, but our server spoke so highly of it that we had to try it. Delicious! For dinner we had the Gorgonzola beetroot ravioli and tagliatelle with a lamb sauce. \u00a0Keep in mind all the pasta is homemade and it tastes like it. \u00a0What a treat.We had the tiramisu and cheese cake for dessert and I wish I could recommend the tiramisu, but can't. It really lacked flavor and actually seemed a little watery. \u00a0The cheese cake was very good and not sugary sweet. \u00a0We would repeat that one.The restaurant is pleasant with soft lighting and excellent service.Would definitely recommend it and return to it!",

We all felt that this restaurant should be paying its customers for the god awful polenta served.On top of the terrible food and pretty tame environment - it's gluten free ?! Make what you will of that.Finally when it came to settling the bill which we split amongst four - we had to separate service charge - so dividing it up five ways - so weird. Food is really gross - do yourself a favour and AVOID.",

Try the gnocchi - you won't regret it! I was overwhelmed with the presentation of the dishes, so much so that I ordered a starter and two mains. The bruschetta was lovely and flavourful, the gnocchi was divine, and the mushroom polenta pie was almost too beautiful to eat.  \u00a0 Attentive staff checked that we were happy with our meals and explained how they prepare polenta, and how their process, the traditional one, differed from the instant polenta on offer in supermarkets. The combination of tradition and culinary creativity and skill was wonderful, as was the meal and the feeling of being full to the bursting, yet without teetering on the edge of a carbohydrate coma, left me itching to visit again.  \u00a0 Give polenta a chance - what this place does with it is magnificent.",

This was the second time.I ordered a gnocchi made with mushrooms and polenta. They were quite mushy, which was fine because they were really quite smooth... Except for the dirt. Every bite had dirt in it. It's a pretty unmistakable crunch feeling in your mouth and it's not uncommon with mushrooms that haven't been properly cleaned. I didn't make a fuss because they'd been kind enough to seat me without a booking and told me I'd only have 35 minutes, so I knew it wouldn't be useful to ask to swap it out. And it was drowning in truffle oil. So, you know... truffle oil can kind of make anything edible.When asked how the food was, I told the server about the dirt in the gnocchi and she assured me it must have been chunks of mushroom. I mean... I've been eating food all my 40 years. I'm quite familiar with the difference between a chunk of mushroom and dirt. In addition to this, when I arrived a different server took my order and she had such contempt for me I felt bad for even visiting. And it's worth mentioning that the couple next to me complained that their dishes were both quite cold.I've been in UK for 10 days and every other dining experience has been a delight. This one stood out in the worst way.",

The food far surpassed our expectations, the only real downside was the temperature - it was incredibly warm inside and we were all a bit uncomfortable.We ordered two sides as starters, the grilled polenta with red pesto and the bread with the aubergine caponata. Both were excellent.For mains, I got the duck ravioli which was very good but also very rich. It used ground duck which I'd never seen before, and had a slightly bland flavour in the duck itself, but all the ingredients combined to great flavour.Other dishes ordered were the bolognese, the ricotta and spinach balls, and the polenta gnocchi with salmon. Everyone was quite happy with their meals, though none of us were able to clean our plates - the dishes were surprisingly filling, especially after we'd had our starters.It's a small place and might be better suited for the summer as people were trying to navigate walking through with thicker coats without knocking over glasses on other tables - but other than that and the temperature, a place I would definitely recommend.",

The side salad was literally just a chopped up iceberg lettuce (still wet), some tomatoes and a few slices of raw mushroom.On top of the mediocre food, the service was somewhat weird. I understand that the management may take a cut of the service charge (and I disagree with this practice and circumvent it using cash whenever I can - and feel the service warrants it), but that doesn't mean its okay to insist that we process the service charge as a separate card transaction because \"it's better for us\". Perhaps the staff would also be better off avoiding this place if that's the game they have to play.I really hope they were just having a bad night, but I won't be going back.",

We were welcomed with the typical laud & hearty Italian 'Buona Sera,' by Francesco, who to our surprise has a Polish girlfriend from a city next to ours and speaks beautiful Polish, which doesn't often happen among foreigners in London. \u00a0 \u00a0The place isn't big, quite buzzy but at the same time very homey. It seems that people who work there enjoy themselves and share the Italian hospitality at its best (Francesco hasn't stopped entertaining us for the whole evening, evening playing 80s disco-Italiano songs at our request). \u00a0I was really looking forward to trying their truffle special I'd spotted on Facebook before, but unfortunately, they didn't have it that night. We've started off with egg, black pepper, scamorza cheese, smoked salmon, lumpfish eggs and orange which was very good. To my surprise the polenta was creamy and very tasty. The other starter was a board of cheeses (cimbro salvia e rosmarino, monteveronese malga 24 months, gorgonzola and caprino cheese with truffle) which came with little pieces of grilled polenta, quince jelly and oils. I'm a cheese monster, so I've tried many interesting cheeses befor, but I must say the truffle cheese was one of the best I've ever tried! However, considering most of the mains cost on average 10 pounds, I found this starter a little bit pricey. For mains we both took creamy polenta and grilled tomino cheese with onion's marmalade (my friend went for the non-vegetarian option with pancetta). I've never tried that cheese before and I really enjoyed it especially with the onion marmalade. I couldn't finish it, though, as the starters were already quite generous. The menu changes regularly, and from me personally a big bonus for gluten free options.If you still not convinced about polenta, you can choose from regular pasta dishes like pappardelle, lasagna or gnocchi in numerous variations. You can also compose your own salad.The dessert list looked very tempting, but we were too full to try anything.After one glass of wine, I left La Polenteria in such high spirits that I felt as if I had had a few. We had great fun, we will definitely be back!",

Yes, reallyLa Polenteria has just opened its doors and they're still running a 30% opening discount on their polenta main dishes. That and curiosity drew me in for lunch todayItaly has elevated some of their peasant food into restaurant food and polenta continues this trend. Their menu is built around polenta - crushed cornmeal. It appears with fruit in their breakfast menu, with a choice of meat, fish and vegetarian accompaniments as a main course and in desserts such as cupcakesThe staff were very friendly and we had a good natter about everything Italian from football to mama;s cookingI chose Tuscan sausages to go with my polenta. I was pleased to see that polenta still had pride of place on the plate - it was creamy and well seasoned, Very satisfying on a cold day like today. The Tuscan sausages came in a tomato based sauce with beans, I felt the sausages could have done with a little more pumch but still a most satisfying plateThe cupcakes looked inviting but I had other plans for dessert today.

My wife had the Handmade \"Teff Lemon Ravioloni,\" and the lemon curd was bland, but that was also all you could taste. \u00a0If there was any seafood in the ravioli, it went unnoticed in both quantity and flavor.As someone who cannot eat gluten, I've learned to make concessions, but this was not good in any sense other than portion size. \u00a0I love polenta and love its naturally gluten-free flavor, but this was incredibly poor and uninspired execution. I have to hope - given the other stellar reviews - that this was just their worst day since opening, because I have no idea how they could warrant the number of five-star rating they've received.I will end on a bright note: The focaccia was excellent.================I want to add that I don't usually write Yelp reviews. \u00a0I understand that people's livelihoods are dependent on these reviews, and that there can be issues from day-to-day, but this was just so bad all around that I had to write this.",

Polenta is good!)Well, since not enough people eat polenta, this is a great place to get the word out on how great polenta is.Yeah - they have sandwiches and salads - but you know what you are here for.It comes with about 8 to 10 choices of toppings most of Mediterranean extraction and most good.The Sicilian Caponata (that's eggplant for them that don't know - like me coming in) is a wonderful italian dish that could easily stand on its own but serves well as a polenta topping.the Bacalhau (thats salt cod for them that don't know - I had to guess from the portuguese) is on the salty side - which may be a sign of not enough soaking before cooking.it is still pretty good.but the star of the show is the polenta - which if it wasn't so much work to cook, would be the kind of thing i would like to eat every day. i might not take british rail all the way in from reading just to eat at la polentaria - but if i worked anywhere in the neighborhood, this would be a regular choice for lunch.",
