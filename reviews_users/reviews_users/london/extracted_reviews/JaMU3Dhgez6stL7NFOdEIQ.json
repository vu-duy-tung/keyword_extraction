    "text": "I used to rate Christopher's very highly however my last visit was not very pleasant. I believe the quality & service has went downhill. I came here for Thanksgiving- which i usually do. I found the staff not very friendly and the service incredibly rushed. From the moment we sat down our waiter wanted to know our entire order- once we gave it- he did not come back once to us the entire meal. It was difficult to get anyone's attention and everyone was rushing around. I ordered the vegetarian entree and it was very odd. It was advertised as celaric gumbo with jalapeno beignets & cornbread. Sounds filing enough... but when it came I was shocked to see the gumbo was no bigger than the size of a thimble put into a carved hole in the bottom of a courgette. The cornbread was hard and dry & a tiny cube. They then put cherry tomatos that were stuffed with rice around the courgette which contained a thimble sized portion of the gumbo. I was very unimpressed by the vegetarian entree, the taste, & my experience. My husband was pleased with the turkey entree but also felt the service and experience was so rushed that it became unpleasant.",

Usually locations in the center of the theatre district can be hit or miss but this venue continues to surprise. It is American cuisine true and true so it is a great spot to hit up whenever I get a tadbit homesick. The portions here are proper American portions - nice and healthy! I had the blueberry pancakes which were delightful. My FI had the equivalent of what they call Juevos Rancheros in the states - he was pleased with his meal as well. My British friends noshed on Bloody Mary's and Steak and Eggs and the Parisians had the fig and cheese platter, hash browns and pancakes. All were happy and full by the end of the meal and delighted that they had found a new spot in town to frequent! The decor is also pleasing to the eye. Not too ornate but still enough pizzaz to give you the feeling like you are in a special place, not some chain food restaurant. We had some additions to our party at the last minute and they were quick and easy about accommodating us and because we were so close to the theatre we weren't rushed at all about finishing up our meal. I will definitely be going again.",

    "text": "\"American Grill\" is an addendum that really ought to be read with apostrophes, or raised eyebrows: this is a restaurant with a finger in a good few cultural pies. The lounge bar on the ground floor is as bronzed and suave as a Max le Verrier model, with some rather swanky booths from which to peruse what is surely (assuming you like martinis) an embarras de richesse on the cocktail menu. On climbing a grand stone staircase -- lit all the way with tea-lights, and observed chubbily from the ceiling fresco by a handful of putti -- you reach a restaurant that resembles nothing more than a exquisite and high-ceilinged drawing room; testament, it appears [1], to the building's Victorian heritage. Service is friendly while by no means overbearing: staff are attentive, and the generous selection of home-made bread proffered on arrival was among the best I have experienced. The menu is as diverse as the restaurant's self-styled denomination of \"modern American cuisine\" might suggest; a definition so gloriously capacious as, ultimately, not to define very much at all. Lobsters flown in daily from New England sit comfortably alongside their sustainably-sourced Southern counterparts (blackened salmon with jambalaya risotto is one such offering), while the large selection of side-dishes unites a Mexican-inspired Monterey mash with the Southwest's endearingly named - and impeccably cooked - 'tobacco onions' and 'shoestring fries'. At the sizzling centre of the 'American Grill', of course, is steak - of which the restaurant is lavishly, and justifiably, proud. Cuts of 28 day-aged prime Scottish beef make up almost half of the main course selection, accompanied by lovingly-crafted tasting notes on the merits of marbling and the spare elegance of a fillet cut (\"tenderness assured\" [2]).The menu lapses in imagination - if not, usually, in the other kind of taste - when it seeks most to embody 'Americana': the quintessential, the retro, the downright whimsical. I can only assume that proximity to National Peach Melba Day in the USA (the thirteenth of January) prompted the inclusion of that dish in the dessert menu. I'm more ambivalent as regards the roast beet salad with chicory, ricotta, and cabernet vinaigrette, ordered as a main course from the starters menu. The main ingredient being a type of shredded lettuce notoriously to be found as a packing ingredient in burgers and burritos the world over, I must assume that the chef's aim here was, via the dual agency of ricotta and red wine vinegar, to rescue it from the opprobrium of tastelessness. It is perhaps the best -- if the most back-handed -- tribute of all to say that, being Christopher's, this roast beet [\"hold the shredded lettuce\"] salad managed to be as tasty as any salad I've ever ordered. Anywhere.[1] But not as a drawing room. The colourful history of this magnificent Grade II-listed building includes life as a papier mache factory, and, \u00a0after 1870, as London's first licensed casino.[2] Meanwhile, I was myself assured by my dining partner of the extent to which, as a vegetarian, I miss out on the delights of combining a Christopher's medium grilled rib-eye with a glass of good pinot noir (surprisingly good value at less than \u00a325 a bottle).",

Highly recommended for lunches and a nice cocktail bar downstairs for your evening do to roll on a little further. Perhaps a little 'suity' at but not enough to put you off. Highly recommended.",

Our company staff and guests really enjoyed the place in terms of food and decor. On the down-side service was a bit ditzy and the steak wasn't actually that good (I realise that perhaps with the 12 people who ordered the kitchen is under pressure, but there was a fair amount of tough fat and sinew on what was meant to be a prime cut). The wine menu is fine, although be careful with the staff recommendations. They really need perhaps need someone with a bit more experience doing this. Good thing we had a senior member of staff who collects the stuff and changed the set-wines straight away! Upstairs was nice, reception is for want of a better word 'posh'. As someone mentioned it is kinda 'suity' and I wouldn't go here except for company things. For steak restaurants, Gaucho's or Smiths' of Smithfield is a far better choice. However for privacy and the good atmosphere this did in-fact beat Smiths. Overall 3 stars, for the price I would've expected the food to be better.",

It was really crowded the night we were there but it didn't feel squashed or too crowded, there was still room to move around and enough seating for almost everyone. Definitely a great bar if you're looking for a higher end bar to catch some drinks before or after dinner and a great location too.",

    "text": "While I was visiting London - I met some friends at Christopher's for Sunday brunch - what a great brunch spot! \u00a0We sat upstairs where they have a larger dining room (which was really crowded) and a smaller side dining room that has a great view of the theater area. I'm not sure if this is a pricey dinner place - but it was pretty affordable for brunch. \u00a0They have all the traditional brunch fare - eggs, pancakes, healthy granola stuff, etc and plenty of bloody marys and mimosas to start your morning off right. The juices were really really good - fresh squeezed orange juice - none of the icky made from concentrate stuff.I shared steak and eggs and the watermelon/blueberry/spinach salad with my friend - all of it was delicious and large portions. \u00a0Service was excellent - definitely a place I would come again!",

Moreover, the bartenders (not the waiters, alas) know pretty much every cocktail ever made, so don't be afraid to order off the menu too.The first time I came here, the bar staff let my party stay quite late (it was a Monday night) before asking us politely to leave. The second time, the bar staff remembered me and managed to find me a table even though it was busy. They even remembered how much I liked dirty vodka martinis, which I thought was a nice touch. Most recently I went with a close gal pal; two of the bar staff came over and greeted us immediately, went out of their way to find us a table (it was a Friday night, prime after-work drinking hours), and one of them gave me a two-for-one loyalty card.The service, as you can tell, is brilliant, and the cocktails aren't bad either. This isn't the sort of place I would come with a large group, because the bar is often quite busy and tables seem to be reserved far far in advance. It is, however, a great location, and the cocktails deserve their price tag. Nice for a quick after-work drink, or a romantic cuddle with a friend (mood-lighting a-plenty).",

    "text": "I've got to thank Volkswagen for bringing Christopher's to my attention as they sent me tickets for a deluxe dinner and theatre experience earlier in the year, but I have only got around to using it. Well both son and daughter getting married in the same year (bailiffs due anytime now) but i digress, back to Christopher's, it coincided with our wedding anniversary so i thought what a nice treat for us and as usual, we arrived in plenty of time to allow pre dinner drinks, so into the cocktail bar we went, ordering a large G&T for my wife and a large Drambuie for myself, just to wet our appetites. I suggested that we try a cocktail, as they looked and sounded rather tasty. Not being a great lover of, spirits, but a great chocoholic, i was drawn to the Nutella Martini, consisting of Vanilla Vodka, Creme de Cacao, Cream, Nutella (of course) & shaved chocolate. This is how adults should take chocolate, in liquid form and with a smooth, but strong alcoholic kick, this was followed by a Caramel Heart Martini and a Chili & Chocolate Martini, (I did say i was a chocoholic)! Our appetites suitably wet we went upstairs for our dinner. The dinning area isn't that large, neither is is too small, but found it to provide diners with sufficient elbow and seating room. As we had opted for the pre theatre menu, we weren't expecting much in either taste or portions, but we were wrong, opting for the two course menu, our choices of smoked tomato soup with basil oil, cod cake with rocket & Harissa remoulade for our first course was found to be quite amazing as it there was so much flavour packed into such small portions, the main meal of Grilled '100 Day Aged' BBQ Rubbed Bavette of Beef with Grilled Tomatoes & Chunky Chips, was equally amazing and left a nice spicy bite at the back of our mouths. Cant fault the service, as our hostess and waiters were very professional and helpful, without being intrusive. I would recommend that if your in their neighborhood then drop in, even if your not hungry, you have to try their cocktails.",

I will say that the crab cake I had for my second course was PURE MAGIC. There was no talking for ten minutes while I eagerly consumed this meat-cake-o-deliciousness.

Also accompanied by generous helpings of bread which the waitress kept offering. Wine menu is fantastic and well priced. The food presentation is very pleasing as well. Especially in the deserts of which I could have eaten all of them. Second time Dining I had the chicken with quinoa and again I was pleasantly surprised by how lovely the food was.

Finally flagged the waitress down to ask about how they make their martinis. She started to spout off what was in it.

There was nothing wrong with the venue or the food, but I was left feeling pretty \"meh\" about the whole experience. On arrival our coats were taken & we checked in at reception. Straight away I thought of similarly set up places like Hawksmoor & had high hopes. Upstairs our table was in the back corner so not the best. Looking at the tables and the room I felt like I was in a parish hall being used for an \u00a0event - no real atmosphere & the centre tables seemed randomly rotated to fit in. The food was nice, the coffee was terrible. My BF had steak & eggs which was literally a piece of steak with 2 eggs on top, centred on a massive empty plate. I had the mushrooms & then pancakes. All in all pretty underwhelming but not horrible by any means. The staff were pleasantly aloof. \u00a0At \u00a365 for brunch for two people I'd expect to walk away feeling stuffed & singing a places praises but not so in this case. There are plenty of other, more exciting options for brunch in London so I don't think I'll be back.",

However, that facade faded almost immediately after we settled down.

Or two. \u00a0We were greeted by lovely staff who ushered us to our seat, shortly after we greeted by our waiter who was polite and helped with our drinks selections. Excellent staff plus amazing selections of martinis and cocktail equals susess. This was my first visit here; Now that I've found this place, it won't be the last.",

I went for the apple pie martini with the almond Madeleine. It was dessert in a liquid, not too overpowering with the cinnamon, nice subtle flavours. Very drinkable too!! Great service, and great mini bar food too.",

When we arrived upstairs, we were seated promptly. The decor is classy and elegant. I had salmon cakes which were very tasty and sweet potato fries. The dessert was absolutely delicious although it didn't look like there was much on the plate. Would recommend if you are looking for a classy night out for dinner.",

    "text": "I've reviewed this place twice now and both times are for the cocktail bar only, which does do some rather tasty libations (I've obviously been frequenting Mr Fogg's too much recently as libation is my word of choice this week!). I've always told myself to make sure to come here and sample the food on a special occasion. Guess what, guys?! I finally made it! Upstairs in their restaurant I treated a couple of friends to a posh dinner to celebrate a works promotion for one and comiserate a really tough week for another - tough week and only Wednesday, not good!Firstly, booking. No problems here, we were straight in at the time we wanted. I then phoned up to enquire about booking pre-dinner drinks and was helpfully booked in. Then we were late and didn't make the drinks, so I felt a bit bad about that.But we arrived, were treated to the free cloakroom and shown to our table. My friends didn't know where we were going and I don't think they expected an upmarket restaurant like this one, more something cheap and cheerful. So they were happy already!We ordered a lovely bottle of crisp pinot grigio (\u00a322 was a fair price for this in a restaurant) as we had all decided on mains of either fish or chicken. 2 of us plumped for the blackened salmon with a tomato-based risotto and the third chicken with what looked like a puy lentil side offering. \u00a318-19 each for these dishes so we expected some good food here. Side dishes (which you paid more for) were sweet potato chips and a green vegetable mix.Bread to start, good selection of different flavours here. The butter was nicely mixed with herbs but was too hard, I think it should have been taken out of the fridge a bit earlier. Then the mains arrived - the salmon was soft and tasty but a little bit overcooked, I was hoping for it be slightly pinker in the middle. But it flaked well and the blackened crust was a really nice touch. The risotto side was nice (a bit stodgy) but the side salad took the edge of that with a really refreshing dressing. My friend made all sorts of yummy noises at the chicken - she was quite loud so tables did start to peer over!The side dishes were perfect - crispy sweet potato and salty greens of al dente broccolini, mange tout and sandfire. A bit too al dente for me but I do like my greens done a bit longer than most. So all in all, at \u00a321 ish per person for mains we were satisfied. A bit overpriced perhaps.Then the desserts came round. We decided to be naughty - why not, it was Wednesday right?! We ordered 3 and split them, brilliant plan since I love sharing food and trying little bits of everything. First was creme brulee - slightly burnt top but really mellow flavour underneath, complimented with a berry summer pudding - refreshing and fruity. Second a beautiful banana tarte tartin, sounds like it shouldn't work but it did! wonderful sweet and sticky sauce over this one, decadent and rich. Served with a smooth vanilla ice cream and a chocolate brownie to add a bit more naughty to this dish. Then finally (and I mean Oh My God!) was a chocolate and peanut butter tart with a caramel sauce and espresso ice cream. Now you have just named all of my favourite foods right there and this thing was divine! All of the yummy noises came from our table at that point. Very filling, but rich and deep in flavour with the coffee kick from the ice cream simply snapped you out of your chocolatey,'eyes glazing over' food coma. That thing was divine. \u00a37 or \u00a38 each, more than worth that price!So overall, 4 stars. Friendly staff (if a little slow) they always kept the wine topped up and were courteous and helpful. Just a slightly disappointing main (in comparison with the dessert), I left happy and content.",
