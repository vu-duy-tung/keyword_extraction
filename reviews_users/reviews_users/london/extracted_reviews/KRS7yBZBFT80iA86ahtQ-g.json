    "text": "I went to Santor\u00e9 with few of my friends, after one of them told us about this place =). As an Italian, she recommended it so this place could only be good !We decided on pizza's, and Santor\u00e9 has the option to choose the size of your pizza...UP TO 1 METER LONG ! So yes, we obviously went for the epic 1 meter pizza. With something this long, it allows you to have 4 different pizza variation inside (the long pizza being divided in 4 sections ).It came all cut, making it easier for us to share.The taste was amazing, the pizza dough was neither too thin or too thick, not greasy, just perfect. There is no other word to describe it ! Among the ones we choose, my favourite was siciliana (tomato sauce, mozzarella, sauteed aubergines), but they were all really tasty. You won't be disappointed.That one meter pizza was enough for the 7 of us. That made 4 pieces each, but you might consider getting a second smaller pizza to share (we were all small eaters). With a big pizza for 7, we got out for less than 10\u00a3 each.Staff is happy to help you choose and advise you, or let you order a first round and eat before asking for a second round of pizza.They are genuinely really nice is setting the table for our 7-people group, and generally speaking. We were sitting outside, so I cannot really tell for the inside organisation, but I am sure it is as nice as the food.",

    "text": "Sometimes a rating is more a draft based on comparative analysis. i believe my review score of santore is one such review.Spoiling myself with neopolitan pizzas during my youth and later as a young man eating thin crust pizza from hoboken to brooklyn to new haven, my palette for pizza perhaps in unparalleled.Wait, maybe i shouldn't go that far.Santores is not the best pizza iv ever had. However, the elements of true greatness are on display and for london so far, its has not been beaten.The crust is part burn and part soft dough. Slightly soft for my taste it certainly whisked my senses away momentarily to the gritty streets of naples. Perhaps most disappointing was the ham, surely not italian. the spicy salami though made up for it. A constant curse I have found so far for Italian restaurants in London, some great ingredients and others so far off that dished are immediately a downgrade. Guess will have to live with that one until global warming brings a Mediterranean climate. Upon completion of my meal I knewtmy time here in london will always have the emergency pizza joint. The friendly and cheerful wait staff surely will not keep me away either.",

First thing you notice is that it is always busy, not always a good sign in fickle Clerkenwell but here, a lot of the customers are regulars and know they are in for a good time. Second thing you notice is the fantastic island of fresh antipasti. A plate of this make a hearty starter or a nice lunch on its own. Thirdly are the the authentically italian waiters. Efficient, friendly and with a mediterranean swagger they add to the experience immensely.Pasta dishes are honest and full of flavour. Pizzas are thin, crispy and packed with toppings. They can be ordered by the yard where they are draped across an elevated platform.If you are down 'our way' and want a guaranteed good dining experience check out Santore.",

Salad was crappy.I eat everything in sight, always \u00a0.. and at this meal, I left food on the table. \u00a0Hard to emphasize how much of a let-down this meal was. Service was a pinch pretentious .. but not overwhelmingly so. \u00a0We had high hopes for this place, as we live in the area, and their patio is amazing. \u00a0But, the benefits stop almost as soon as the first plate arrives.I am not a big chain fan .. but I'd keep walking several store-fronts down and dine at Strada if you want something that actually tastes good. \u00a0I'll take a British or Polish waitstaff serving good Italian, rather than Italians serving very unfortunate Italian.",

Every type of classic appetiser, pasta and Italian style main. The pizza list is also as long as your arm.Both my friend and I opted for the full blown pasta starter and fish for the main. \u00a0I had the fusilli seafood dish which was quite tasty I may say. \u00a0Great pasta, well cooked and good seafood selections including fresh shrimp with the head included (that must be good right?!). \u00a0Portion slightly too large for a primi but I guess this is to cater for those who eat pasta as the main.For my main I went for the seafood mixed grill which had a nice selection of fish, but again too much with the quantity and a slab of salmon which didn't strike me as very italian. Slightly under season and lacking in flavour but all very fresh tasting. My friend when for the seabass which looked quite well done, more of a fusion than an Italian but still quite tasty.Mains also came with sides of potatoes and greens which we didn't ask for and were a nice touch. \u00a0The staff were also very friendly and gave each of us a shot of limoncello with the bill.Wine was average but I'll blame that on the friend!Is it the best italian in town? No, but the competition is tough (see my other reviews). \u00a0Would I be back again? Yes, there's plenty on the menu here that I want to come back and try.I give it a three and a half.Enjoy.x",

I went to this little Italian restaurant when we had forgotten to book a table anywhere and were in need of some pre-gig food before quite possibly a messy night.Wow! It's not very often that the service in a place can really knock me off my feet but here they did. They were a busy restaurant filled with office workers having their Christmas parties and even though they were fully booked said that if we would be gone by 8pm we were very welcome to eat there. It was 6pm and I considered that we may want to stay longer but thought that 2 hours should be enough. The staff were polite, patient, always smiling and incredibly friendly without being annoying.My friend and I ordered from the set menu and had a selection of anti pasta for starters. We then had home cooked pizzas that were cooked right in front of us (we were sat right next to the kitchen which is all open) and some very tasty homemade cocktails. This place is a gem and I'm so glad I found it, better than any pizza express and independently run. I cannot speak highly enough of it.When it got to 8pm we weren't rushed out our seats, everything remained calm and we happily left, smelling of garlic and with our bellies full.",

We always get pizza but thought we'd branch out this time and give them a chance. We got antipasti, which turned out to be unseasoned vegetables and overly fishy-tasting fish - only the beans and ham on the plate were good. Then we waited over 40 minutes for our mains, which were disappointing when they finally came - and not even warm enough! Our capricciosa pizza was soggy, and the toppings were poor-quality, as previous reviews have mentioned - tinned salty artichoke in big chunks and tinned olives. The veal rolled around aubergine was bland and tough. When we expressed our disappointment to our waiter - after paying the bill, even the automatic 12.5 tip, because who wants to make a scene - he did not seem to understand what we were saying. Never again! The place across the street also has terrible pizza. I'll have to find somewhere else entirely for my pizza fix.",

While the pizza menu was very pork heavy (read: no chicken or beef meat options here), a friend and I shared a couple of delicious vegetarian selections, and a crisp rocket salad on the side. Ordering pizza by the \"meter\" seems to be the way to go in the future, especially if you are in a large group and want to sample a variety of flavours. What could be improved? The service was adequate but not great (our pizza arrived about 5 minutes after ordering, but it took us almost 15 minutes to get the bill!)... and I wouldn't mind a more extensive wine and beer selection. But that all said, I could certainly see myself returning to Santore in the very near future.",

This is also a place my beloved and I like going to and we have found ourselves going here with friends. There is a but coming up though. I find the food can be slightly hit and miss. The place has good days and bad days. Things that usually are fail-safe is the pizza. This is what I always have when I come here. The antipasti platter is also a smart option. I find their salads though to be disappointing and the desserts can sometimes be sublime or average. I shall forever be a fan of the panna cotta for its dome like shape and comedy wobble. It also tastes great but I love the juvenile humour that ordering it can generate. But if you want pizza that makes you feel happy and leaves you with a slightly better idea about what pizza should be about then come here. I love that you can order by the meter and that it has a smokiness from the wood fired oven. Every time I have a pizza craving, I come here. The flavours are always fresh and the balance of ingredients generates the right levels of umami in the mouth to tide over a pizza craving until the next time (or next performance). Prices here are reasonable and you can eat well for prices that don't break the bank. It does get busy, and sometimes there is a massive wait but it's worth it.",

    "text": "For pictures please refer tohungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  I was strongly critised by my Italian friends (most of which are from Naples, where the pizza was invented) that pizza was completely absent from my blog so far. This is basically explained by the fact that for me, pizza is absolutely neglectable so I would never dream of ordering it if I can avoid it, let alone go to a dedicated pizzeria. Gladly, they did not give up in trying to convince me otherwise and they organised an outing to Santore at Exmouth Market which is \u00a0according to them \u00a0one of the few places where you can get authentic Napolese pizza in London. Apparently the chefs and staff are from Naples and also the ingredients they use are imported from there. Santore does convey some Italian atmosphere, especially with the outside dining area which makes you feel like you were eating on an Italian piazza. Also the menu sounded very Italian to me and the choice of dishes did not seem to be adapted too much the the non-Italian palate. I thought the pasta dishes sounded fantastic and I wanted to basically try all of them but I had no choice but the go for the pizza (or lose a couple of friends). In addition to the conventional round pizza, the pizza can be ordered by the metre. This is firstly very impressive, secondly it's sociable and the best thing really is that you can try many different pizze without needing to steal food from other people's plates. Despite my prejudices against pizza in general I found the version served at Santore really delightful. We tried four different sorts on our metre of pizza made with perfectly thin and tasty if maybe not quite crispy enough dough. The Pizza Napoletana (7.95) with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella as well as capers, anchovies and olives (7.95) provided a perfect balance between dough, tomatoes and the saltiness of the anchovies and capers. The Bufalina (9.95) with fresh buffalo mozzarella and generous fresh basil leaves (9.95) was the prettiest of them all, you suddenly know where the colours of the Italian flag must really come from. The mozzarella was ripe and flavoursome and fresh basil is heavenly anyway, so this was a clear success. The Rustica (9.45) with friarielli and salsiccia (a typical dish from Naples) won the prize for being the most unusual and interesting of the lot. It is not often that I am faced with ingredients that I have never come across, but I really have never eaten or even heard of friarielli. It is related to broccoli but fortuntaly does not taste of broccoli at all. It has a very distinct slightly bitter and peppery taste and I thought it was very moreish. The salsiccia were not the best I have ever tasted but subtly flavoured enough to not overpower the friarilli. I definitely would have this one again. The least convincing for me was the Pizza Siciliana (8.45) with tomato, mozzarella and sauteed aubergines with parmesan- even though I love aubergines, they seemed a too moist and heavy topping for the thin dough and ended up making it a bit soggy. It still tasted very nice though. All in all I have to say that I might not have become a complete pizza convert overnight but I did very much enjoy the meal and I think I could be persuaded to go back to Santore I have to add, in case you think I am not the best person to judge a pizzeria (you might be right there), that I have interrogated my Italian friends very closely and they all gave the pizza 7 or 8 out of 10 indicating that Santore might not quite have Naples standard but seems to be pretty close. So if you don't believe me, believe them!",

And while its proximity may have influenced my opinion, I would say Santore shaped my favourable outlook of living on Rosebery Ave.Santore is a rather quiet restaurant for what is usually a busy (and sometimes rowdy) street -- \u00a0simple Italian cuisine with sizeable portions and a great, yet affordable, wine selection make this a favourite of mine. In fact, I liked it so much I made a point to stop by in the past two times I've had layovers in Heathrow. I particularly enjoyed their roast piglet, but their pastas are great as well -- they typically have different specials every night, so make sure to try those out. It's commonly said that the thinnest book in the world is a British menu -- while this may be somewhat true, London does Italian food exceptionally well and Santore is near the top of the list. You'll likely find better restaurants, but for the price point that Santore offers, you'll be pressed to find better value. The lemoncello they give you at the end with your cheque certainly helps too!",

We had 20 people altogether, seated between 2 tables of ten. We ordered 4 metres of pizza (2 metres per board) to split between 10 people at the table, and had 4 types of pizza on each. It was actually the perfect amount! The house white wine wasn't very expensive, and we were too full for dessert but the staff came out and sang for the birthday girl, which was very cute. The service was great and it wasn't stressful at all, even with a large group. I will definitely come here again!",

This restaurant is in the middle of nowhere.... well, at least it's not close to any tube but it's not far either - 25 mins walk from our hotel in Holburn. Our local friends spoke highly of this spot so 8 of us came here for dinner after work on Friday. We each ordered something different. I had Papperdelle and my husband had Fuselli, the food is up to par with some of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Dessert was awesome too - I recommend the Tiramisu and Warm Choco cake w/ Pistachio ice cream. Yummmm!!!Service was a bit rushed, but that's because there were plenty of people outside waiting for seats.I would come back again!",

There were real Italians working there and real Italians sitting at the table next to us loud North Americans (silly Canadian friends...). That means it is good, right?

Already the hostile treatment started when they seemed hesitated that I would bring in a large group. On the day they told us big groups only at 9:30 and some members of the party came late. As me and a majority of members sat down the waiters came to ask for the rest of the members of the party, \u00a0if not, they would charge us for the seats or then they would be taken away. Ironically they had to give hem back to us because more people ended up coming. We ate and had a good time. I did tell me friends that they should have been in time, however in the end I was rather shocked to see one of the waiters scream at us all to 'fuck off'. Regardless of how much annoying my group of friends were, this is no way to be treating a customer in the first place. Beyond appalled at the behaviour of the staff here and as I called to give in my feedback and to tell what happened, they kept on telling me my friends had provoked him. Not a great night. The hostile treatment of the staff ruined the mood very much.",

Myself and 5 friends were looking for somewhere relaxed but with high quality food and boy o boy did we find just that here!I was able to book a table on the day for 6 people and we were given a two hour time slot (8-10pm). On arrival we were shown to our table straight away and handed food and wine menus.I had read a few reviews previously and was aware that they did meter long pizza - very impressive!I ordered the calamari, with garlic tomato bread to share for starter and a pizza (for 1) for main!The portions are HUGE! Seriously, mahussive! But this doesn't take away from the quality. The calamari was crispy and fresh served with a lovely garlic sauce and the garlic pizza bread was delicious, with no shortage of tomato - yummy! Now to the pizza, ahhh yum! I love pizza and this one didn't let me down - topped with Parma ham, rocket and Parmesan shavings - it really was a wonderful but, for me, there was way too much Parmesan shavings.Overall though a fantastic meal, plenty of food, great quality for the price, friendly staff and a great location, slap bang in the middle of Exmouth Market!

Yep it's a bit of a gimmick, but backed up by the flavour and the genuinely talented chefs that are visible in the kitchen area, levitating pizza dough by the oven.Before you think I ate 1m of pizza by myself (which actually sounds like a great saturday night activity come to think of it) there were 5 of us there for dinner, and we'd booked ahead which I'd recommend. Each 25cm section represents one pizza, so we got to choose 4 different types to build 1m (which seemed to take an age to decide on) and ordered chips and a mixed salad on the side.It felt like a bit of a wait for the food, though a bottle of merlot helped with that and it was worth the wait when it arrived. They put a special stand on the table so it arrives with a bit of a flourish, and it's pre-sliced so everyone just gets stuck in. I don't think there was a stand-out topping for me, but I just liked that the base itself was tasty and not too thick. I thought it was a great way to get variety rather than everyone just getting one type of pizza each. The menu does ask that you don't tinker with the topping ingredients too which shuts down any fusspot eaters you might have with you! Very reasonable prices and in a lovely location in fairy-lit Exmouth Market. The only warning I would give you is that this place is loud. Like take a deep breath and bellow at your neighbours loud, so not one for a quiet dinner to whisper sweet nothings to a date. A high energy fun dinner where you can laugh as loudly as you like though? This is your bag.",

    "text": "Enjoyed a Saturday evening dinner with three others - four of us in total. \u00a0 I'm pretty impressed. \u00a0 Firstly the location - right in the heart of Exmouth Market. \u00a0Nice - almost car free - street that offers lots of little restaurants and bars/pubs.We had reservations at 8p and the place was pretty busy, but it's pretty big so there were some open tables for people who just pop in impromptu. \u00a0I do, however, recommend making reservations as it got quite packed especially when we were leaving.For starters, we got a 1/2 meter pizza - check out the photo. \u00a0It's basically two pizzas joined together so it's a bit gimmicky but tastes great. Crust is done well and had tasty toppings. I had a Napoli seafood pasta. \u00a0Pasta was cooked well, al dente. \u00a0Came with lots of seafood and the portion size was great - I was full. \u00a0In fact, portion sizes for the other dishes were really good as well.Service was very friendly and the waiter was very patient with our ordering. \u00a0Definitely look forward to visiting next time I crave Italian food!",

    "text": "Let me start off this review by stating that the pizza at Santore is pretty darn good. Some of the best I've had in London but, sadly, it is not the best. Sacro Cuore and Santa Maria Pizzeria still reign in first place (a tie probably because they are owned by the same group of people) with Homeslice (a completely different style of pizza) coming in second.So why only four stars when I said the pizza was some of the best I have had in London? The short answer is price and location. Price: I nearly poo'd my trousers when I saw the price of a pizza - \u00a310.35! What the??? I ordered the Americana (pizza with salami and basil). This same pizza at Sacro Cuore or Santa Maria Pizzeria would have been \u00a38.95. Perhaps this is a west-outside-of the city versus east-in-the-city thing but for me, the prices were too high. Location: I live in West London, not too far from Santa Maria and Sacro Cuore, so it was quite the haul to get to Santore. Longer journey time, more expensive journey, more expensive pizza, and not as good. Was it worth nearly an hour of commute time? Yes, I'm glad I tried Santore but I wouldn't choose to dine here over any of the three aforementioned restaurants. Would I choose to dine at Santore if I were near Faringdon? Yes.My husband and I visited over the lunch hour on a Wednesday. We were the second table seated in the restaurant and, by the time we left, there were only a handful of tables seated. In other words, the place was dead. Service was prompt and courteous. The check was delivered upon request and super fast.The pizza crust (aka base) was cooked well, a slightly rubbery/chewy bottom and slightly burnt edges, just how it should be. The basil that sat atop of the pizza was put not he pizza before it was put in the oven - a big no no because the basil will burn in the oven, just as it did on my pizza. I had to pick it off and set it aside. The salami was of good flavor but was cut a little too thick for my liking.Overall, good pizza on a cute little road but a bit pricey for the offering.",

    "text": "What a lovely meal we had at Santore... We ventured out to the adorable Exmouth Market to celebrate. Chris F. and I are always bookmarking places for special date nights' and he planned this one, but coincidentally, I also had this gem bookmarked. We started with the soup of the day - Creamy Chickpea Potato. This has to be one of the most lovely soups I've ever had. It came with lovely pieces of bread on top. Perfectly seasoned. Yum!My husband ordered the Vegetarian pizza and I ordered the folded pizza, which was like an Italian quesadilla. Delicious. Though Chris' pizza was nice, mine was divine, and I had so much left-over that we were able to eat it the next day for the majority of our lunchtime meal.Santore adds a 12.5% service charge, but as an American, I'm good with tipping, and usually leave more than 12.5% anyway.The wait staff was very nice. We had a lovely meal and lovely time at Santore. I can't wait to go back. The only thing I would have done differently would have been to order extra soups to go for the next day. That soup was so darn good!",

    "text": "Great Italian place on Exmouth Market. Bustling and busy, the restaurant is already packed early on a Saturday evening and the people here know why.The menu is classic Italian: antipasti, primi (wide range of pizza and pasta dishes) and secondi meat and fish dishes plus desserts. Everything looks good.The restaurant is casual style and comfortable with pizza oven at the back.We shared a mixed antipasti plate (see pic). Quite enough for two and all good. I followed with the classic orecchiette with broccoli and sausage. I liked the way the broccoli was cooked down to make a soft sauce with the sausage meat. No room for dessert after that.Service was excellent and friendly, despite the place being completely full.Reasonable pricing so good value too.",

Unfortunately I was still jet-lagged from flying into London the day before and wasn't really hungry so I only ate about 1/5 of it. Heated it up for dinner though and it tasted just as good :)The calzone has mushrooms, salami, ricotta, and mozzarella cheese with tomato sauce. The menu doesn't mention it but i think there were a few basil leaves in there as well. Everything my co-workers ordered looked delicious too. Will definitely try and come back the next time I'm in London.",

A very hefty amount of food since the pizzas are a meter across, and they don't skimp on the cheese. The spicy oil drizzle is perfect contrast to the meaty oil.Lots of couples on dates, so plenty o' hand holding.Such a good next-day breakfast with an egg atop!",
