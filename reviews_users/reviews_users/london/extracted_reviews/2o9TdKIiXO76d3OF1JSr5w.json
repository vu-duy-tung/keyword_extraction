While the server was friendly and pleasant, they were basically out of everything and the coffee wasn't even that good. (and I don't ask for fancy coffee, just black and strong in a cup). The server was nice, but seemed confused by every interaction.There is a real parallel to an NYC diner style menu and ambiance, yet with a distinctly British angle. What I've not been able to get over is how, on a Sunday at lunch they can be out of nearly everything - no portabella veggie burger, no Pimms, no London Pride, no chips, no sparkling water, etc, etc - out of everything.So, maybe the food is pretty good, don't (and probably won't) know. Ended up going across the road to Byron for a great burger and chips.",

They're really small, and the dough is more like bread dough.Service is ok, nothing exceptional, but allright.The proximity of the tube station, the museums, and mostly, of the waitrose supermarket, make it really convenient.Enjoy !",

My husband had a cheeseburger, which was huge, and it came with a generous portion of well seasoned steak fries.I was also suprised to find that their food was reasonably priced - much less than the local pubs.

We stopped in here for a bite before heading back to the hotel across the street, and I ordered Pie&Mash, girlfriend had the salad bar and some sides. Her salad bar run was pretty disappointing although she did get cold pasta there, which was the height of her plates. My pie was decent, however the pastry was too thick to cut with the provided butter night and I ended up having to tear it like an animal because our waiter didn't come back to our table. The meat was absolutely delicious. The mash was some powdered box mix with absolutely no flavor whatsoever and almost hard. I melted some butter and added salt and pepper for a little bit of taste which made it manageable but I'm not sure why I should be making my own meal at the table. The best thing maybe was that I got a London's Pride beer with my meal, and as a tourist, I definitely appreciated it.",

    "text": "A friend and myself visited Garfunkels Restaurant in, London. It was a special occasion and we were celebrating together. We had planned for a special meal.Unfortunately we were both left very disappointed. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived late that evening. We were shown to a table and ordered drinks. Service appeared to be very slow and we literally had our drinks and orders thrown at us. We both ordered the prawn cocktail as a starter priced at \u00a35.99, which was basically a large bowl of iceberg lettuce with a few little prawns on the top. Half way through this we found a large piece of white plastic mixed in with the lettuce. It looked like a corner off a food product bag. I called over the waiter to explain that I wasn't happy with the starter as it contained plastic; he informed me he would tell the manager. At no point did the manager come over to us. It was only my insistence that I was not happy to pay for this, that the waiter agreed to take this off the bill.No apology was made and neither was the offer of a replacement starter. Still, the manager never appeared despite being made aware of our complaint.I ordered the sirloin steak priced at \u00a315.99 and my friend ordered the mixed grill priced at \u00a317.99. Both of us were unhappy with both meals, every piece of meat was very very dry and felt like it had been left under a heat lamp for several hours. The chips were the only nice part of the meal, as were the onion rings, however, for the price of the meals it is rather an expensive price to pay for a few rings and chips!Both of us left the majority of the meal, eating mainly the chips.Service was generally poor, and not once did a waiter ask us if everything was 'okay' during the meal.We got the impression that we was not welcome there as to the side of our table builders had arrived to fit and install a wall cupboard above a till point - not exactly appropriate when customers are still eating.Our plates were taken, again we were not asked if the meals were 'okay'.We remained drinking the rest of the bottle of wine we ordered, and within minutes, a server arrived to collect our glasses in which we were still drinking from. He appeared disappointed that we were still drinking.The bill arrived at the table, without us even looking at the desserts or finishing our drinks. We weren't offered any coffee or desserts and were made to feel rushed to pay and leave by the unrequested bill arriving. We both wanted dessert and a liquor coffee!Before we had chance to pay the bill, the lights were turned off on part of the room, then a man (who appeared to be the manager) walked over and learned across us to inform us we must leave as they are closing. We had only been in the restaurant approximately 45 minutes, and both felt that if our custom was accepted when we entered the restaurant, then they have a duty to ensure they serve us properly, otherwise, perhaps consider closing earlier.Generally it was a poor meal with very poor service and quality. This spoilt our special occasion.",

They do have a full bar as well, which is always a bonus for me. Very much like a Chili's here in the states - which I wouldn't step foot in normally. But, if it was the only reasonable restaurant open with free wifi and never a wait or rush, I'd make an exception.Of the 5 servers I had over the weeks period, only one smiled and seemed the least interested in service or displaying friendliness. The others simply dropped food.",

    "text": "Man I really was hoping this was a hidden gem. :(After a long day of tourist activity's my husband and I were starving, we had probably walked around for a good 45 mins looking for a restaurant we could agree on when we stumbled into this nice little pub. So let's dive into that one star review shall we.....I'll start with the positive which was the atmosphere. I found this place to be very cozy, warm on a windy day and also casual which is my favorite! The only other positive I have is the staff, they seamed to be very helpful and nice people in general. Now on to my bitching season. The food! Omg was this a ginormous let down! I had ordered the steak, probably the most expensive thing on the menu but this was not my first choice. First I asked for a club sandwich, they were out. Weird. They were also out of the other 4 they had on the menu that looked interesting, all that was left was a Ruben, no thanks. Anyways the steak was presented pretty well not bad for a bar I give them that. However the only flavor I tasted was old meat that had been frozen before cooked for way too long, or it was just bad meat all together. Either was no seasoning was added I ordered it medium rare, it came out medium. They have no steak sauce either so masking the bland old tasting meet wasn't a option. Sad. My husband ordered the fish and chips his comment was it was ok, but not anything worth writing home about. My one star. Let me explain. This is solely based of the food alone not the service. To me 90% if my dinning experience needs to be actually food flavor. This place was definitely lacking in that department immensely. If your looking for a nice bit to eat and want a sit down place I do not recommend this place. Save your money and find somewhere else. As I said earlier, good presentation, not so good food.",

Contrary to some reviews, the food & customer service were actually very good. Dinner featured pasta with salmon, coupled with three large pieces of bread. Portion sizes for the entrees seem to be on the small-to-midsize of things, yet that appears to be the European standard. In addition to the draft beer of Stella for a reasonable price, the meal was nourishing enough to quell all hunger pains until 2AM the following morning. Not too shabby for 22-25 pounds.With regard to this franchise's location, I can't complain about it being close to the Gloucester Road Tube station. In fact, its right around the corner from it, and enclosed within an indoor mini mall (for lack of better nomenclature). Save for Garfunkel's downstairs bathroom (which felt as if I was entering a dungeon/torture chamber), the restaurant experience was pleasant.",

The service was ok, the staff are friendly, but it's nothing to write home about. I ordered a bowl of porridge with a 'drizzle' of honey for \u00a33.50, but it was the stingiest portion that came with about a drop of honey on top! The waitress did however come back with a tiny butter dish containing about a tablespoon of honey when I asked for more, but still it's completely laughable and an absolute rip-off.",

One of our orders were not delivered - ordered a pie but got fish, which I accepted to eate with ny family, since I had no time to wait for them to prepare a new dish - dispite this mistake we were charged for the full cost.
