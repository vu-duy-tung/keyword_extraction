Without fail, I order myself some fantastic courgette flowers (who knew they could be so good!) and one of their cheese plates along with a nice big glass of red wine. It's one of those places I go if I want to know that I won't be disappointed in the food or the service, which is a great combo when you're feeling indecisive about where to go for food. Plus, the atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed enough that I could sit all night ordering more plates.",

    "text": "A fantastic spot for my office's informal Second Christmas Lunch, Salt Yard treated my colleagues and me to rich, gorgeous tapas, friendly service, \u00a0and a lovely atmosphere. The food was really, really terrific. Just wonderful. Rich, flavourful, diverse, exotic, and truly delicious. To be honest, we were glad that we didn't follow the \"2-3 plates per person, plus patatas fritas, bread and ailoi, tortillas, olives and other nibbles for the table\" recommendation for sharing, because we would have had absolutely no hope for rolling ourselves back to the office and getting our last bits of work done. We each ordered one or two plates--the Monte Enebro cheese-stuffed courgette flowers drizzled with honey and the chorizo were the absolute stars of the meal--plus tortillas, etc, and sent them round for sharing. There is an excellent mix of items on the menu, from the lovely-and-accessible grilled tiger prawns or lemon rosemary roasted chicken breast, all the way to the thrillingly-exotic stuffed baby squid with fennel or baby violet artichokes with pine nut puree. Everything I had was truly excellent, and I would auction off my first born for another serving of the stuffed courgette flowers. The server was friendly, patient, knowledgeable, and happy to help with suggestions and wine parings. For a decently large party peppered with picky eaters and tapas novices she was an absolute star in helping us get precisely what we wanted, and each of us walked away happy, relaxed, and full to the point of bursting. The only very small gripe any of us had with the meal was the space afforded to our party. There were, I believe, 9 of us, and we were seated at a corner booth that should have comfortably seated 6 or so. We were able to cram in just fine and it turned out to be far less of an imposition than it had initially appeared, but if we'd been allotted just a slightly bigger table the experience would have bordered on 5-star.",

    "text": "Full review and photos on thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  The Salt Yard is sort of posh Spanish tapas, with charcuterie platters as well as hot plates, and the food was pretty awesome. We ordered a glass of Selva Capuzza (Groppello, Lake Garda 2009) (not picked by me but amaaazing, \u00a36.50 each) and tucked into the delicious-sounding menu \u00a0they suggest about 3 plates each. We had the Spanish charcuterie board which was perfect with the wine and very nom, and the Courgette Flowers stuffed with Goats Cheese in a light batter and a wonderful honey sauce which were just mouth-watering. And then Jamon Croquetas with Manchego which were light and delicious too. And then the big guns \u00a0the delicious Salt Marsh Lamb with Cipollini Onions, Wet Garlic and Fennel Pickle which was mouth-wateringly tender and just YUM and then Chargrilled Bavette with Pumpkin Caponata, Shallots and Crispy Bone Marrow which was cooked wonderfully rare and juicy and was probably my favourite dish and finally the Crispy Squid with Sea Purslane and Shellfish Alioli which was delicate and light and crispy. The menu is bloody brilliant, we kept stopping to nod and mumble praise at each plate, and I'd like to go back to try other things like the pork belly and chorizo with peppers. So we then had another glass of wine because it was just THAT GOOD it would be rude not to, and left feeling warm and happy for the rest of the afternoon. We both agreed it was a spectacular lunch \u00a0beautifully cooked, interesting and delicious. The downside was that it ain't cheap - for 2 glasses of wine each, a huge lunch and 2 coffees, it was just under \u00a3100 or \u00a350 each and just popping in to sit at the bar to have a glass of wine and charcuterie board to share (which looks ace) would set you back at least \u00a330 each I reckon. But I wasn't paying so it was all good. And although I wouldn't make it a regular lunch venue at that price, for a special-ish occasion, it would be the perfect place to take your best mate / mum / beloved for lunch or a wine-and-charcuterie snack, like after Christmas shopping in town. Yes, for me shopping is a special occasion. Alternatively, do like the HPL and wangle an invite for a free lunch.",

My first visit to this fantastic Tapas, Charcuterie and wine bar was for a sit-down tapas meal at lunchtime with some colleagues. We selected a decent array of dishes but we had to order more Pork Belly (Confit of 'Gloucester Old Spot' Pork Belly with rosemary scented cannelini beans) because we ended up fighting over it. It was incredible. As were all the other dishes of course but this was a definite favourite. I ended up coming back the next week just to try some more! Subsequent visits have not disappointed either. The fish selections are first-rate with the Smoked Monkfish (Smoked Monkfish with Gooseberry Puree and Pancetta) and the scallops (Sauteed Scallops with Romanesque Puree & PX Caramel) really standing out. This is also one of those tapas restaurants where vegetarians can also expect to leave satisfied with the non-meat options. Items such as the Stuffed Cougette flowers and the saut\u00e9ed Girolles sure to excite even the most carnivorous members of your group. Finally, the upstairs area also serves as a very pleasant wine bar with it's own bar snacks menu. Surely any place that boasts quails' eggs and acorn-fed Iberico ham as 'bar snacks' has got to be worth a visit.",

The service was pretty good with our Aussie waiter fairly attentive and friendly when we needed him but otherwise was welcomingly absent for the rest of the night (it was a pleasure not to feel too much pressure to leave once we'd finished eating.) Unfortunately the food was a bit of a let down and very pricey. The menu is apparently constantly changing. Everything was presented beautifully except for the strangely barren Chorizo. Ironically the most simply presented (the Courgette Flowers, Squid and Chorizo) were definitely the tastiest dishes whilst the dishes with the more complicated presentation (the Beef and Salmon) were disappointingly tasteless. Portion-wise I guess with tapas you can expect to eat quite a few dishes to get your fill and I was just glad that we'd had a gigantic lunch so I was feeling adequately satisfied sharing the above with Sandra. Salt Yard for me was just okay.",

We gave our (US) mobile phone # to the lovely gentleman who greeted us, then went down the street for cocktails. He called us on our mobile (called us internationally, in fact) when the table was clearing, and we popped right over. We waited exactly as long as it takes my boozer friends to consume a single cocktail!I love tapas and was so excited to have landed in a Michelin-starred restaurant in London! While the gent at the door was delightful, our server was not. We ate and drank enormous amounts, and were the easiest customers she could have as we love to eat everything, so all she had to do was bring us food, but her attitude implied she was above her role. That didn't stop us from literally eating almost everything on the menu, including two nice bottles of wine, dessert, cheese course and digestifs. Despite the amount of food we ordered, I didn't leave feeling grotesquely full (whatever that means; either we didn't get enough to eat or I ordered the proper amount for a change?)A couple of the dishes were Delicious, but for the most part, our group compared the restaurant to other far-flung tapas restaurants (Chicago -- Azucar, Las Ramblas, and obviously many in Spain) that were actually as delicious if not more so......without the Michelin to hang their hats on.Obviously more pricey, it was still a great night out and wonderful memory of one of the many dining experiences we had most recently in London.",

No tables available for walk-ins on this rainy Saturday night, but the bar had space and comfy bar stools with padded backs. Good value glass of red wine (\u00a33.75) and a bottle of good Italian beer, and we were happy already. We decided to pick one plate each from the fish, meat and vegetable sections and were pleasantly surprised by all our selections: roasted sea bream with saffron mash and marinated squid in a delicious broth, chargrilled venison haunch with beetroot and a caper/anchovy dressing, and fried violet artichokes with pine nut puree. These are not your usual tapas! Will try the charcuterie plate next time; they had a proper meat slicer and everything. Bill came to about \u00a330 for our three tapas, wine and beer. Service at the bar was friendly and attentive, not pushy at all. Did I need a \u00a31 Tesco sandwich later on? Sure, but we're not rich! Will go back -- to Salt Yard, I mean. Well, Tesco too. Good place to bring friends, too (Salt Yard, not Tesco).",

    "text": "A disappointing experience but fabulous food. But how can that happen? My wife and I booked a table through saltyard.co.uk online for 7.00 pm last Saturday evening. We specifically let it be known that we would dine on tapas and requested a RESTAURANT table in a separate e-mail. When we arrived promptly at 7.00 pm we were told that the restaurant in the basement was fully booked - it had been allocated to 6.00 pm reservations. The basement restaurant actually looked very nice and would have been most acceptable. However, we had to make do with the ground floor bar, which I would describe as an uncomfortable, cramped but up-market snack bar, where diners may sit on bar stools or small tables to dine on gourmet bar snacks, charcuterie and fine wines. We were there for the much trumpeted RESTAURANT tapas and fine wine, not the snacks. We were very disppointed that we had not neen advised in advance that a table in the restaurant would be unavailable. One of the staff had telephoned me earlier at 3pm to request confirmation that we would arrive at 7pm, so there was no excuse for the absence of honest, couteous communication. Perhaps management correctly guess that people in my situation would normally cancel the reservation and dine elsewhere. I've been running my own business for many years so I'm naturally cynical. The small cramped tables along the wall facing the bar were awful. They are small, but worse still - there is not much space between them, so at a busy time like Saturday evening there is no privacy. We could hear our neighbours conversations on both sides. We ordered fantastic chargrilled bread with dips and just 6 tapas dishes to share. The tapas were delicious and from a quality (but not quantity) angle fully deserve the five star rating given by TimeOut. If it is possible to have a least favourite dish at the Salt Yard, it would be the potato and ham croquetas for me. The tapas portions were much smaller than I'm used to seeing, especiially the courgettes and chargrilled chorizo dishes. We also had the Classic Tortilla (which was the most substantial dish), the delicious spring chicken and a lovely Terise salad. At \u00a322 the bottle, the Spanish red wine was superb. The staff were professional and helpful - they deserved the 12.5% service charge which is automatically added to the bill. Given the uncomfortable cramped conditions and that we were paying restaurant prices for sitting in a glorified snack bar, the food does not provide value for money. After ordering the food and wine my wife headed downstairs to the Ladies. Annoyingly she slipped on a wet floor on the way in and fell on her knee. Fortunately there was no damage, she was sober and she is lightweight and agile. If she had been tipsy, overweight and unfit, the accident could have been very nasty indeed. More attention to customer safety is required. We each had a quick espresso coffee, paid the bill (seventy something pounds) and left at 8.15 pm. We were actually allowed to stay until 9.00 pm and under normal circumstances I would have ordered perhaps two more tapas dishes, possibly cheese and/or puddings too. However I was frankly glad to get out of the place and will never go back. If it wasn't for the superb quality of the food and wine I would be giving this restaurant/snack bar the lowest rating of just 1 star. Zero marks for the management.",

    "text": "Before I start, I should probably say I wasn't in a Salt Yard kind of mood. At all. I've been once before about 4 years ago so had thought it was time for a return visit. But after a ridiculously annoying day dealing with a boiler that suddenly went kaput - and then an insane rigmarole with British Gas trying to fix a time for them to quote (yes, quote, not even fit!) for a new one...so I have to waste next Tuesday waiting in between 7am and 9pm... I craved comfort. Big, cosy, bowls of risotto-y, sausage-and-mash-y type of comfort. Not fiddly little plates of dainty stuff.But off I set for Salt Yard nonetheless, as I hate messing friends around by changing arrangments. It was chucking it down with rain. After about 3 minutes it became clear the boots I thought were waterproof were in fact totally broken across the sole. Arrived at Salt Yard at 7.15, wet feet and all - and luckily there was a table. We shared some safron and seafood arancini, courgette flowers with goats cheese and honey, and scallops. My friend also had some chorizo with peppers which I couldn't try as I am allergic to chilli. The arancini tasted solely of saffron, I couldn't detect any of the seafood which was apparently inside, but they were very small, so I might have missed it. The scallop was fine, but not very hot, and the cauliflower puree didn't really add anything. I liked the courgette flower. We seemed to have finished eating by 8.30 and I didn't like any of the desserts on offer - so merely to prolong the evening, I ordered some mint tea I didn't really want (the waitress said the decaff coffee was not very fresh) and a cantucci I didn't like (wierd aniseed taste). The bill came to \u00a320 each which seemed a lot for what wasn't really a lot of food, and I'm not exactly full.So I am not really sure who Salt Yard is for. The food was good, with lots of interesting choices, but don't go when you're hungry. Or when you've just been landed with a \u00a32,000 bill for a new gas boiler.",

    "text": "Check out my blog for photos and more:hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  I tremendously enjoyed some of the dishes I had at the Opera Tavern earlier this month and was therefore keen to try its two older siblings Salt Yard and Dehesa. All three restaurants serve a range of charcuterie and tapas-style dishes with strong Spanish and some Italian influence. While dishes like the pork and foie gras burger at the Opera Tavern were amongst the best things I have eaten in the past few months and showed signs of true genius, Salt Yard was a disappointment in comparison. All the non-cooked dishes such as Serano ham and cheese were highly enjoyable, but Salt Yard was let down by the dishes that required preparing.Padron Pepper (4.25) We nibbled some Padron Pepper (4.25) while choosing the wine and these were good and nicely seasoned, if a bit too oily for my liking. Also from the 'Bar Snack' menu was the Confit Tuna with Crostini (3.50) which was for me a rather unpleasant dish. The tuna was tough and far too salty but could possibly have been saved by proper Italian style crostini. Sadly, the bread that came with the dish was sliced too thinly and was much too hard, resembling bread crisps. You might feel differently, but I realised at this point that I am not very keen at all on bread crisps. Much better was the moist and flavoursome 18 months cured Serano Ham (8.40) served in thin slices (at this occasion thin slices were a good thing). Similar to the Opera Tavern, the bread had to be ordered separately. The only choice of bread was the Chargrilled Country Style Bread with Olive Oil OR Aioli (2.55) which I quite liked, but which was categorically rejected by dinner companion. All he had to say was 'This bread is crap'.18 months cured Serano Ham (8.40)Confit Tuna with Crostini (3.50) From the main tapas menu we tried the Escabeche of Mackerel, Fennel and Broad Beans (7.25). Not exactly a dish to write home about as the mackerel was too dry (the kind of 'sticking between your teeth' dry, I am sure there is a good word for this in English, could anyone tell a poor foreigner what it is?). It resembled pickled herring, only pickled herring is better. The Asparagus, Broad Beans, St. George's Mushrooms and Peas with Summer Truffle and Shallot Dressing (7) sounded so delicious, it was let down however by several flaws in its execution. Asparagus and beans were overcooked, the chef was very stingy on the asparagus and we only got the back bits (I mean really, the nice thing about asparagus are the heads, right?) and the dressing was basically non-existent. The slices of summer truffles didn't taste the least bit of truffles either, so I had to satisfy my truffle craving with the dessert in the form of Truffle Pecorino (6.25). I love this cheese, and the piece served was generous.Escabeche of Mackerel, Fennel and Broad Beans (7.25)Asparagus, Broad Beans, St. George's Mushrooms and Peas with Summer Truffle and Shallot Dressing Salt Yard is not a bad place at all and I would surely go back there for some charcuterie, cheese and beautiful Spanish red wine. The atmosphere is buzzing and the crowd is young(ish) and relaxed. If I fancy cooked Spanish food however, my choice shall be Opera Tavern. Have a mentioned that they do amazing pork and foie gras burgers there??? Now I am wondering whether I should bother trying Dehesa or go back to Opera Tavern straight away. Any thoughts?",

From the fish section, we ordered the soft shell crab and squid, both things I always love and really enjoyed. Far from being rubbery, the squid had a refined flavour. Meat wise we got the beef which was quite delicate and the jamon croquetas with manchego. I've found croquetas to be a bit disappointing at times, but these were excellent.The highlight for me was the truffled macaroni cheese, cep and truffle arancini, and gnocchi with girolles. There's a general theme there! Rich, creamy, sensational food. The food of dreams. It was so good. You have to try it.Service was pretty efficient, we were left alone quite a bit at the beginning and end of the meal but the food once ordered came out quickly. Only thing was a couple of times plates were taken when they still had sauce I needed for dipping!We were tucked in a table at the back which was nice because we had more space and less bustle.

Lowlight: frites bravas were just English chips with paprika on them and sauces that weren't hitting the flavor mark as you'd find in Spain. A lazy attempt at this simple dish.

    "text": "\"I think the beef changed my life\"Randomly found this place when looking for a late night dinner. Most of the other kitchens in the area closed around 10pm, but not this place!It's a tiny restaurant lover two floors, the ground floor has a small bar and open kitchen where you can see them cracking away at the charcuterie etc, we got a table, but next time I'll sit at the bar cos then you can watch them in action. The tables are quite tight together, which made things a bit awks when the girl next to us started to bulb her eyes out!The food really was top notch, fried squid was heavily salted, but light and crispy. We also had their version of patatas bravas, a bit more like home made fries, with aioli and a separate tomato sauce. The potatoes were damn near perfect, slightly crispy around the edges, but sweet soft and fluffy in the middle. Truffled macaroni was a bit odd, the cheese sauce was too thin and they obviously used truffle oil as opposed to proper truffles, at \u00a38.50, for a small(ish) dish, I expected more. We also had the most amazing beef high, a bit like warm carpaccio, on a bed of lentils which was a complete taste sensation. I think the beef changed my lifeService was snappy, as expected, no complaints.",

There are four small tables outside and then lots of seating inside on two floors. A simple menus with some very nice choices. We ordered the lamb, baby squid, and courgette flowers. The honey really complimented that dish. There were a few other dishes and then for dessert we had the churros with chocolate sauce and biscotti with a glass of dessert wine for dipping. Both were nice. I don't think the menu online has all the dishes they serve. What made the dinner memorable was Helena Bonham-Carter sat next to us for about a minute with her friend. They looked at the menu, laughed historically and then left. What was that about I will never know.",

Still liked the octopus but there was too little of it; more potato than anything else. We got the red wine and that went perfectly with our selections. The restaurant is small and intimate... service was great. We finished the night by trying the ricotta dumplings, chocolate fondant and homemade cantucci. My favourite was surprisingly the first one, they were like fried sweet donuts!",

    "text": "You want to treat yourself and your date with some fine wine and tapas in a cozy atmosphere? Salt Yard in the Fitzrovia neighborhood is a small two-level restaurant with candle light tables that create a very intimate setting. Great for both date nights and business dinners, this place is busy every night - reservations highly recommended.Starting with the wine, you won't be disappointed. Salt Yard has Spanish and Italian wines on the list, from sparkling (Cava Rosado, Prosecco), sherries (Manzanilla, Palo Cortado, Pedro Ximenez), white (Campi Flegrei, Tanca su Contissa, I Frati) to red (Bellamarsilia, Pittacum, Cerasuolo), with prices from \u00a33.75 - \u00a38 per glass or \u00a315 - \u00a3275 per bottle. I tried a bottle of Rioja (\u00a323), a very delicious and smooth white.That was good, but much more of a highlight was the food (in terms of quality, not quantity). As a snack, I ordered the \"Italian Selection\" of finocchiona, salami toscano, capocollo, and speck (\u00a38.75), with outstanding slices of salami. Followed by several plates of tapas (pan fried duck Breast with parsnip puree, caramelized chicory and blood orange, \u00a37.75, and smoked wild mushrooms with olive oil whipped potatoes, free range egg yolk and chorizo oil, \u00a35.75), which was not only beautifully arranged but flavorful and somewhat exotic in taste. A fantastic experience.The service was awesome - very friendly and although the place was packed, very patient. However, I don't recommend going there hungry unless you don't mind spending about \u00a330 per person on the food (starters, tapas, desert) itself.",

Yes it's a little more pricey than your standard traditional Spanish tapas but the ingredients are top class and you can see and taste the care given into each little dish. \u00a0Strangely a bit quiet when I went and as such this along with the decor made the experience less casual and more formal than how tapas traditionally is, but that's a minor point and probably reflects the quality of the food, and protagonists more about me preferring to bum it out.",

However, they managed to turn an otherwise uncomfortable situation into something classy by making the furniture swankier and the decorations cooler. Overall, a type of ambience suitable for its upper-class tapas prices. The tapas were tiny, but delicious. Loved, loved the cured meat (salami?) dish. Same goes for the desserts, we ordered something chocolatey (was it churros?) - really sinful and decadent. (if i can remember this even 3 years later, this means it's awesome)Overall the bill was a bit eye-popping (for the poor student in me), but it was a great experience. If I ever get rich enough to start spending lavishly on food, this will definitely be a regular hangout for me.",

The seats are comfortable enough to do so and you still get the same level of attention, service and a really enjoyable experience. You must, must have the tempura courgette flowers, filled with goats cheese and drizzled with honey. They are to die for. These, combined with some padron peppers, serrano ham (18 months cured, drool...), chorizo, bread and maybe another hot dish - possibly the scallops - make up my ideal menu.Oh, and I also had the most heart-attack-inducing but utterly delicious dessert here. It was a special, and basically (to my shame), it was bread & butter pudding. But made out of pannettone. And deep fried. Then covered in sugar and cinnamon. And served with ice cream.ANYWAY. It sounds horrendous, but it was absolutely unbelievable...",

So I was sleepy, but with boosts of caffeine, I toughed it out and glad I did because it made me stumble upon Salt Yard.They have a fantastic \u00a320 set menu for lunch: a starter, a main, and a dessert. This is real food prepared by a talented chef, so in Central London I'd call that a borderline steal.My brain wasn't functioning properly, so I cannot describe exactly what I had, but I know my starter was a modern take on a croqueta that had pork belly, I believe, and was complimented with some fresh and crisp vegetables. My main was a duck dish. (I've posted a photo of it.)Not too surprising, I recall the dessert was a carrot cake foundation with other accoutrement, and it was excellent.The wine list is largely Spanish and it covers all price points. We had a nice Ribera del Duero.I don't frequent London like I used to, so when I travel (and return to cities), I like to try new places, but I would strongly consider coming here again because the food was very, very good.",

It's my go to restaurant for entertaining both clients and impressing friends!The staff are super friendly and never fail to squeeze you in one way or another. The food is always delicious and changes regularly. Yes there are the staples like pork belly on white beans and the fennel salami charcuterie platter. But always something fresh and different such as the unforgettable scallop carpaccio I had over two years ago. Even the story is lovely in that the couple who started the restaurant one being Italian and the other Spanish so they decided to make a fusion tapas menu. You can't write this stuff!If you find yourself in the Charlotte St. area then do yourself a favour and go check it out!",

    "text": "I finally managed to venture my way to Salt Yard with their fantastic Bank holiday offer where they were offering a staggering 50% off food during lunch. As much as we enjoyed our lunch the place lacks that charm it has in Ember Yard. It was very closed in, a long bench seating where you share among other customers but with your own small individual table. You also have the choice to sit around the bar. I suppose they try and fill the place with as many seating as possible to avoid people queuing but in the end you lose out on the nice relaxing vibe like you get in their sister branch, Ember Yard which I love. It just lacks space and privacy.Food wise it was great but not extraordinary with some dishes better than others. Most of the tapas were done well but the flavours and textures did not amaze me as much as my first visit to their sister branch Ember Yard.Saying that I was very impress with their Spanish Selection Charcuterie which was very skillfully cut, thin and juicy. They were cured very right to the palate, salty but not overwhelming so the flavours could be enjoyed with the chorizo being my favourite with the punch of sweet spice \u00a0They particularly went well with our Spanish cheese selection, paired very well with a sweet compliment such as strawberry jam with a good mix of the more pungent variety, nutty and creamy.As a side we also ordered Chargrilled Flat Bread with Homemade Butter which came warm and fluffy with a nice light herby butter which I wish they could be more generous with as it was lovely and creamy with a very low melting point so it spread along the bread as soon as it touched it. The quail eggs were cooked perfectly, easy to peel, light and tasty. And \u00a0the almonds roasted nicely, crunchy and salty. Off the tapas menu we started with the Salt Cod Croquetas which were good and crispy on the outside, stuffed generously with chunky pieces of fish. It could have been more creamier but that was resolved by the light refreshing bravas sauce was a lovely addition as it lifted the sweetness and added moisture in the dish.Next came my all time favourite of the Salt Group chain, the courgette flower stuffed with Goat's Cheese and drizzled with Honey. In fact it was so good my boyfriend nearly cried when the plate got taken away before he could lick the honey off the plate clean. It was just that combination the crispy light batter, creamy pungent goat cheese, sweet warm honey against the savoury courgette flower that made this dish amazing. Sadly it doesn't come cheap, \u00a34.50 for one and we had two to share, The Slow Cooked Octopus were incredibly tender and citrusy. They were a bit over generous with the olive oil which I felt wasn't needed and it was also let down by the ratte potatoes which were under seasoned and bland. It seems like the flavours did not seep through.I also was a bit disappointed with the tortilla which didn't have the oozy effect I was after. I had high expectations for this dish. I suppose it is a preference but I also found this dish a bit bland and could have been more richer. I felt a bit of moisture could have made the texture of potatoes and egg a little less dense and stuffy. My least favourite fish had to be the Roast Loch Duart Salmon,Mussel and Saffron Risotto. As nice as the salmon was, perfectly cooked I found the dill in the risotto way too overpowering, taking over all the other delicate flavours. The risotto was also too saucy and lost it's al dente texture. What a shame for such a wonderful cooked fish with it's crispy skin and flakiness. \u00a0We ended with a light finished of Duck Arancini with Mozzarella, Squash Pur\u00e9e and Toasted Pumpkin Seeds. i wasn't sure if i wanted it light as the mozzarella wasn't very apparent. It lacked that stringy cheese and creamy texture I was after but instead had a more healthier wholesome texture to it. Tasted very average to me with the flavours not really coming through, especially the duck which can be very flavoursome. After the meal I felt very happy that we had the 50% off or otherwise the outcome could have been even more disappointing. I just feel I could have better tapas at a more local Spanish restaurant and the prices would have been the same with what we paid. It was also very crammed, little space and lacking something in it's decor although it may have a better atmosphere in the evening. Still I very much prefer Ember Yard being their sister, better food and decor. But I do understand their menu changes seasonally so things can potentially change.",

To be honest, at a certain price point one wonders what one is paying for... every dish was exceptionally tasty, but even to share with a party of four it was difficult. Couldn't help but be painfully conscious that every small mouthful was about \u00a34.Anyway, if you're not that hungry or have the deep pockets, you'll be happy with the flavours. Perhaps just not for me.",

    "text": "Seriously, one of my favourite tapas restaurants in London. They're usually busy, but not overwhelmingly so and they take reservations, unlike most other tapas restaurants in the area. Plus one for Salt Yard.The menu is simple and classic, but they do it well. On my most recent visit, we had the patatas bravas, chorizo skewers, diver scallops (heavenly!), pork belly, and courgette flowers. All were delicious - our faves being the scallops and the chorizo - and we were stuffed by the end of our meal. I've got to say, the Salt Yard group in general does chorizo well... at a separate occasion at a bbq food festival, I got to try their pork and chorizo burger and it was absolutely amazing - the combination of chorizo and pork with whatever seasonings they used worked incredibly well and if I could've, I would've had a second. Wish it were on the menu here!",

Chorizo with anything is great but especially squid and octopus and let's face it, when was the last time you have a squid ink dressing?The Salad of Burrata with Steamed Asparagus, Slow Roast Tomatoes, Grilled Courgettes & Pesto (\u00a38) was also delicious with it's mix of silky, creamy burrata, pesto and mediterranean veg.",

    "text": "Our best dinner in London was at Salt Yard. We couldn't get reservations, but the bar area is first come, first served. There were only a couple of seats left at the bar itself when we arrived...but they turned out to be the best seats in the house! You get to watch the bartender mix drinks and the charcuterie staff cut super thin slices of jamon iberico de bellota (a leg from a pig that grazed on acorns in Spain/Portugal). The bartender and the manager were the nicest people we met. They let us sample one of the mixed drinks when they had a little extra, and even gave us a free board of jamon iberico de bellota when they saw how interested we were when the staff was switching out the legs. Amazing food and outstanding staff! We would go back to London again just to go back to Salt Yard. Highly recommend - and take a seat at the bar!",

    "text": "Delicious set menu, one at \u00a335 and one at \u00a340. We went with the cheaper one and were full beyond belief at the end. The most expensive one may not actually result in more food, it might just be a few substitutions that are a bit fancier, but I'll have to find out next time. You'll need at least 7 people for one of the set menus, but they were very flexible about groups. You'll start with some delicious olives, grilled flatbread (with an incredible accompanying sauce...), cheese and jamon. This will be followed by a couple fish dishes, meat, vegetables, and finally the puddings (if you still have room!). My favorite were the courgette flowers stuffed with goat cheese and drizzled with honey - amazing! Also had some wonderful pork belly. If I were to come back here with just one other person or a small group of friends I'd probably have trouble deciding what to order and what not to as everything was delicious. At \u00a335-40 per person it is a little pricey, but for a special occasion it's pretty reasonable and a great experience.",
