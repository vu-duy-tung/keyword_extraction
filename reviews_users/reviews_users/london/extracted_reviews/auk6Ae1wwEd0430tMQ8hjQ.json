We usually go to The Browns but this time we tried Brumus on a recommendation from somebody we shared a taxi with and we weren't disappointed. Centrally located just off of Trafalgar Square (and close to theatres), comfortable dining area, great service and great afternoon tea at a reasonable price. They also have a full menu and great drink selection giving lots of options. Scones were freshly baked, sandwiches were fresh and tasty, and deserts were varied and also tasty. We also feel a connection to the restaurant because its name is derived from a pet dog that was a Cavalier King Charles Spaniels which is our dog of choice. \u00a0Definitely can recommend Brumus.",

Cheese plate was fine but not fantastic. The prosecco was really good as well. Also, the service was superb. We were a little late for our reservation and they expedited so we had plenty of time to make it to the theatre and even offered coming back after the show to get the dessert if they couldn't do it in time. Really excellent service and atmosphere all together.",

It's opposite Her Majesty's Theatre where The Phantom of the Opera resides at the bottom of Haymarket. Many a time I'd passed by and seen paps snapping away and wondered where it was and my friend who adores the place exclaimed it's the Haymarket Hotel don't you know! \u00a0I've only ever been on three occasions, each time only for a cheeky couple of cocktails or a red wine (to be honest that would be enough damage for my purse to endure!) The cocktails are simply divine and there are so many choices, and they seem to change the menu frequently. The wine was beautiful, though when we went just before Christmas time the waitress who served us charged us for the wrong wine - a more expensive one - and then tried to insist we ordered this but this was quickly rectified. This aside the service has been good when we've been and quick.I've never seen any famous people in there but it seems to be full of media types and \u00a0an older clientele but also there is a mix of younger people and the atmosphere and decor are low lighting and fairly cosy. I would say it's the sort of place for a nightcap or a couple of drinks for a special occasion or to treat yourself. Just ensure you give yourself enough time to peruse the cocktail list and make the right choice!",

    "text": "I came here with the girls for an afternoon tea and on arrival, it looks fancy with beautiful decoration and seated at one of the big wooden table. As people say, don't judge its book by its cover and I totally agree. The service was extremely slow, there weren't that many people in the restaurant, and the food was not up to its standard. I had afternoon teas at different places and this is by far the worst place I've been too. The sandwiches which were suppose to have fillings... it seems there were none. All I could taste was bread & butter. Where's the smoked salmon and ham and eggs that you said were part of the fillings of the sandwiches. The macaroon was way too sweet and doesn't taste that great. I bake my own scones and I do a better job than Brumus. Theirs were dry and didn't feel freshly baked. My friends had the pink champagne afternoon tea and paid an extra \u00a35-\u00a310. They were more than happy to settle for the normal afternoon tea as their champagne taste anything but an ordinary cheap champagne and they had a different variation of cakes (they didn't even get any macaroons!!!)... so nothing fancy about this pink champagne afternoon tea menu.If you want to have a good afternoon tea, please make sure you're not coming here if you want to try good sandwiches/cakes etc and good services. The 2 stars are for the decoration in the restaurant and the somewhat decent tea.",

We had a fantastic afternoon, but I give it a 3 star rating purely based on my afternoon tea experiences at other hotels in London. At Brumus you get a huge pot of tea to yourself, although the selection of teas isn't that huge (no Rooibos, boo!). The sandwiches were tasty, but the crab ones still had little bits of shell in them. The scones, however, were amazing, and they were extremely generous with topping up our sandwich and scone supplies when we were running low. I ate way too much clotted cream, evening spreading it on a chocolate brownie at one point. Oh dear. The service was sweet, but somewhat frazzled, and when they brought everything to the table - being quite a large group - it wasn't made very clear which tea was which and how many people were sharing a cake stand of goodies. But all in all it was good value for money and a great setting and location.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the Firmdale group of hotels (and their restaurants), and Brumus at Haymarket Hotel was no exception. We actually only went there for dessert and cocktails after dining at another restaurant, but the waiter had no problem with that. Although he did forget to give us serviettes, but I suppose it was late. I really liked my crumble, I think it was rhubarb and pear from memory? Anyway, it was a generous serving with enough for two of us -- plus, the custard was amazing. The cheese plate we also ordered has a nice selection of cheeses, but again, not enough biscuits. When will restaurants learn!? The pot of honey was a nice touch too -- so many places don't bother with honey, sadly. Instead of slices of apple the plate was accompanied with slices of pear -- absolutely lovely. With an expansive cocktails list it was difficult to decide, but I eventually settled on some hideously-embarrassing sounding cocktail along the lines of \"Pink Cloud\" (seriously, I felt like such a bimbo ordering it), whereas the husband had a more masculine gingerbeer cocktail. Both were lovely, and delightfully strong too. Perhaps the best indicator of service was when we were leaving, and the waiter noticed it was raining so offered us an umbrella -- even though we weren't staying at the hotel. We said as much, and he said \"oh don't worry, I trust that you'll drop it off to us again soon.\" We politely declined his generous offer, but he allowed us to hover by the reception desk, waiting for our approaching bus. My favourite thing about the restaurant -- and this is a small detail, sure, but an important one! -- is the fact that each plush chair has a different stitched dog on the back. I love minor eccentricities like that.",

    "text": "After much research, I decided to take my mom here for their afternoon tea service, and I think it was a great choice.Attached to the Haymarket Hotel, the restaurant has a chic, contemporary look with lots of color and modern design. You have the choice to have tea in the green sitting room attached to the lobby (which has a very cool skylight and comfy couches) or in the main dining room at the table, which we settled on. At 3pm on Friday, we were basically alone in the restaurant, which was relaxing and quiet, especially after a day roaming the markets and Oxford Street, which arguably evokes mental breakdowns based on the sheer volume of crazy female shoppers.Since it was our first proper tea, we didn't really know what to expect but the finger sandwiches (crab and avocado, egg and cress, salmon and cream cheese, and ham and mustard) were good, and plentiful. The triple plate tower also came with two cupcakes, tiny fruit tarts, brownies, and my favorite, warm scones with clotted cream and jams. I could have eaten 14 of those (and tried). We got Jasmine and Lemon and Ginger teas, which were ok, but I can't really say since I'm far from a tea expert. Perhaps a bit on the week side, but as far as I was concerned the \"tea\" was just something to wash down those yummy scones.Service was great, our waiter was nice and jovial. We sat for close to 3 hours and they gave us as many scones and sandwiches as we wanted until we were fully stuffed and 'experienced' on British tea time. I can't really compare this experience to other teas, but overall I have to say it was very nice, and fairly reasonable (\u00a317 per person). Because, as I'm sure the tea experience at the Ritz is top-notch, I can't imagine spending over \u00a380 for two for tea and tiny sandwiches and treats.Also seems like a nice place to come for tea or a pre-theatre dinner as the Phantom of the Opera show is right across the street.",

I even made a note to research the chairs, as I loved them for my dining room (in my dream house of course!)Te services was impeccable and the staff outdid themselves in both service and interaction. They were fast but did not compromise the effort.I chose a glass of the house white, which was little and lovely. (I have forgotten the name). But it definitely hit the all the right notes.That is where my positive comments end. The food was bordering average (and I was being kind because I was in birthday mood!) I had the Laugostine and Courgette Bisque, which was cold and tasteless. I then had one of my favorite plates, the linguine with chillies and clams. \u00a0I had exactly four clams but an abundance of shells. If there was chillies, I could not taste them. And I had to add salt, a couple of times, as there was none. \u00a0I opted out of dessert and coffee. Though they did bring an after dinner chocies. I had one and it left a horrible taste in my mouth. Alas, I shall not return. But the good news is that it gives me an excuse to have a re-do of my b-day dinner.",

It exceeded my expectations - the service, though infrequent as seems to be customary for afternoon tea, was friendly and helpful. The tea, scones, sandwiches and treats were delicious. The art scattered around the rooms, charming sea-themed washrooms, whimsical tea service sets, and doggy design of the bar stools are all especially charming. This experience set me up to explore many more afternoon tea experiences in London! (Read: I obsessed over it for days)",

    "text": "I have said this before on Yelp: I am a connoisseur of steakhouses. \u00a0I have been to Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, The Palm, Keens, Delmonico's, Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, Bobby Van's, Ben & Jack's, Uncle Jack's, Rothmann's, Gallaghers, the Bull & Bear (in the Waldorf), to BLT (in Washington, D.C.), to Shula's (in Indianapolis), and to Brumus in London (U.K.), (which is not a steakhouse, but the way they cook their cuts of meat--SO GOOD, they might as well be). \u00a0Mostly in New York, often in Long Island, often in D.C., and as far away as London (indeed, I have even been to the top steakhouses in Dhaka, Bangladesh!); I have been to these places to eat, and savor, steak. \u00a0 Multiple, multiple times. \u00a0Yes, I have never been to a Morton's, or to Sparks in Manhattan (even though I worked at the United Nations for years). \u00a0But outside of that, I have more experience . . . than most. \u00a0Consistent with my past reviews, I think the only 5-star steakhouses are Smith & Wollensky and Peter Luger. \u00a0Next are all the 4-star (excellent, beyond delicious, on their own) steakhouses: Keens, Uncle Jack's, Delmonico's and Rothmann's. \u00a0Next come the 3-star steakhouses: Bobby Van's, Gallaghers, and The Capital Grille. \u00a0All of these are great restaurants, worth the extreme price you pay for the top-of-America steakhouse experience.Now it is time for me to write my review of Brumus *as a steakhouse.* \u00a0It does not see itself as a steakhouse, but, it takes such pride in the cuts of meat it sells on its list of steak specials every night, that I consider it at this level. \u00a0I am rating it, *as a steakhouse* as a low, low 3-star steakhouse. \u00a0Again, readers of my past reviews know that I consider a 3-star, top-American, top-Anglo-Saxon world, steakhouse, to be as good as a 5-star restaurant in any other genre.For that reason, I am giving Brumus five stars here, because I know that it will be compared with the general list of restaurants near the Houses of Parliament in London, and I don't want people to think that, compared to that, it is not a 5-star restaurant. \u00a0However, *as a steakhouse*, it is a low 3. \u00a0It only has a few cuts of steak every night, no creamed spinach, and, again, it does not consider itself a steakhouse (which inhibits it becoming a better and better steakhouse--something all top American steakhouses should do).But, what does it have going for it? \u00a0One of the juiciest steaks I ever ate in my life, made juicier by mixing the steak's natural blood and au jus with some chicken broth (delicious, and *brilliant* on the part of the cooking staff), some of the best whipped potatoes I have ever eaten in my life, with or without a steak, and some of the best service I have ever had in London, where I have been to four times in my life already, ate out every night I have been there, and is already the city with the most polite waiters/waitresses on earth. \u00a0The price is fine, given that you are eating at one of the best restaurants in London.If they do steak this well, and it is not even their \"main thing\", imagine how good the REST of the menu must be?When you are in London, you *have* to go!",

Our server was very nice and answered any questions about the menu. He made a great suggestion for dessert when asked. I felt that I was really well looked after. Water was always topped up, whenever we need to get up he would help move the table.

The range of cocktails is good definitely something for all tastes.

    "text": "First impressions of Brumus are great, and under further scrutiny they hold up. It has to be said that because of the unbelievably great pricing of bar food, my friends and I first thought that the atmosphere of the place would be a bit more relaxed. As you enter the restaurant however waitstaff are immediately welcoming and offer to take your belongings to a wardrobe, which sets the tone for the rest of the experience - quite posh!The interior is so dreamy, with dogs embroidered into the backrests of chairs, and incredible marine murals on the walls of the restroom (with a comfortable leather armchair to boot, when you are overcome with tiredness after powdering your nose). Surprises like complimentary mini-ice cream (complete with tiny waffle cone) make pleasant memories.As a cocktail-fan the choices were brilliant, and again presentation has to be called out with one particular concoction involving honey, and being served in a ceramic honey pot, with an astro-turf square for a coaster. The fact that bar food was available to enjoy at the table made my party incredibly happy, and as such we were able to enjoy a wide variety of foods, and ordered seconds of our favourites afterwards!",

I ended up here last night in fact - along with most of the cast from the play I had just seen at the Royal Theatre Haymarket! The bar is decorated really well, with lots of comfy seats and small tables. It's really easy to get a large group in, and just as easy to find a nice cosy corner for two. The cocktails are the real stars of the show, with an impressive list that covers pretty much any taste. Last night I made the mistake of ordering the \"Smoked Cherry Margarita\", not realising quite how smokey the taste was going to be - it was overpowering, but to be fair exactly as it was described on the menu, so completely my fault for ignoring that crucial word!I then tried the \"Pearls and Lace\" which comes in a large champagne flute with a black ribbon tied in a bow around the stem. It looked really sexy and tasted amazing - who knew that cherry, chocolate and champagne could make such a fantastic combination? I also tried the \"Cherry Orchard\" (See the theme here?!) which was just lovely - though if I had to choose, I would go back to have another \"Pearls and Lace\". The service is always absolutely lovely here, last night was no exception, with our waitress making us feel special and well attended to, even though the place was pretty packed.",

The are solid on drinks, but food is another story. It wasnt just my food that was weird - a friend of mine ordered scrambed eggs, and it looks like... risotto. She ate it, but if it were mine...
