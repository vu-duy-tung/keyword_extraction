We had to wait five minutes for a table, which is usually a good sign. The atmosphere was really good, with a broad mix of clientele - young and old, Asian, white and most points in between. Another really good sign. The staff were all really friendly, the service relaxed and welcoming. And the food... oh! Particular favourite was the fish tikka. My GF doesn't normally eat a lot of fish, but even she was really taken with this. We ordered a bit too much, so the staff were only too happy to bag the leftovers for us, which we're looking forward to enjoying at home. One star dropped for the presence of huge TVs in the dining area, something I cannot stand. Looking forward to a return visit asap.",

Tasty kekab wrap & quick service. My collegue got the mixed grilled which smelt amazing.  The 2nd time wasnt so good. My collegue asked for a plain chicken wrap. There was a communication break down & they brought chicken on a hot plate! No wrap but whole bits of chicken with bones in. The waiter wouldnt belive that she'd asked for a wrap, despite 3 of us being there to hear the order! Reluctantly he took the chicken away & she just ate poppadoms as we had to get back to work. There was no appology at all. I dont think all the staff speak a great level of English & suspect thats where the problem lay. I'd go back during a lunch time if you are nearby, but wouldnt travel any distance just to visit there.",

I went with a bunch of boys and they ordered enough to feed half of Whitechapel: peshwari and garlic naans, seek kebabs, lamb chops, tandoori chicken, Daighi slow cooked meat, Daal baingun and Punjab Tinda. And wow! The food was out of this world. Everything was hot and fresh off the grill, perfectly spiced, succulent and juicy. The daal was the best I've ever had and the naan breads fluffy and fragrant. We barely spoke as we scoffed mountains of meat. The staff were super friendly and gave old-school proper service. There was the obligatory and oh-so-welcome hot-towels and choccy-mints and amazingly the whole meal came to less than \u00a315 each. This was the best Indian meal I've ever had, bar none.",

    "text": "This place looks like a takeaway joint from the outside with a small waiting area and salad chiller, but a closer look reveals 2 levels of ample seating out past the grill station at the entrance. We're not regulars in Whitechapel and took this place on as a chance by recommendation and we weren't disappointed. After being greeted by one of the most sincere and friendly welcome's I think I've ever had we were seated and immediately given water, papadums and a selection of condiments. We got a couple of starters including onion bhaji's and a vege samosaboth were a little disappointing, this place is all about the grill. Lamb chops are a specialty of the house and come perfectly charred from the grill and covered in a delicious spicy marinade. Its worth calling in for these alone. Main course curry's didn't let us down either, our karahi lamb and tarka dhaal were both superb and very well spiced following the heat of the lamb chops. Another excellent bonus is the BYO drink policy with no corkage fee. It's amazing how cheap dinner out becomes when you take away the cost of your drinks. We ended up paying \u00a325 for two people and leaving feeling pretty rotund Excellent service, speed, taste and price. What more do you need? We'll be back to Needoo's for sure.",

    "text": "My third visit here and consistently excellent each time. The restaurant is fairly small with a few seats in the front and an upstairs and downstairs seating area. Open kitchen and large grill in the front with some of the meats and vegetable dishes on display - all looking mouth wateringly good. It's also clean, bright and well organised and everyone is busy and active.Needoo serves Punjabi cuisine (Pakastani & Indian). Dishes sampled last night included:- Mixed veg Allo gobi with meltingly soft aubergine, pepper, cauliflower, potato with a delicate slightly smoky flavour.- Meat biryani: slow cooked, fragrant, tender.- Baby chicken masala: perfect spicing and flavours with tender tasty chicken.- Lahori chana (chick peas) which were also meltingly soft and delicious with smoky galicky and spice flavours.Even the zeera rice (with cumin seeds) was full of flavour.- Complimentary salad for the table and papodoms at the start.On previous visits I have also tried the lamb chops which arrive on a sizzling iron platter emitting spicy chilli smoke that was pretty potent. The lamb chops were probably just as good as the legendary Tayyabs, just around the corner. Actually, I think the food in general at Needoo was a touch better than Tayyabs (have only been to Tayyabs once but felt a bit \u00a0like being on a conveyor belt).Only possible downside I can think of is that some of the dishes can be a bit oily but not sure this is a real downside since it probably wouldn't be the same otherwise. This isn't a diet destination.A TV showing Bollywood MTV and proper air conditioning add to the unpretentious ambience.It can get busy at peak times but if you go early there's no wait.Great, efficient service too.It's BYOB which is good \u00a0(just remember beforehand since there aren't too many places to buy beer in the immediate vicinity).So 5 stars for all round excellent food, service and great value.",

I didn't think the lamp chops compared, they were fairly tasty but also tough and I think probably slightly smaller. Service was bizarre...we queued to get in but waited a good 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order which only happened after we flagged them down and after they took the order of the table next to us who had arrived quite some time later. Even then, the guy just wanted to take our starter order. We ordered the aloo gobi which is one of my favourite dishes and which many other reviews had recommended. The cauliflower was extremely mushy and it had no particular flaour. Chana chicken was dry and uninteresting. Aubergine daal was a bit nicer. Lamb samosa was served under (yes, under) a bed of wilted iceberg lettuce (never good, in my opinion, but especially not when off).At the end they were a bit short with us when we needed change to pay the bill and when we lingered for a few minutes someone came over and very pointedly said 'thank you.' I wouldn't have objected had their whole attitude been speed but seeing as they showed no desire when we initially arrived famished I just thought this was rude and summed up the whole experience: sub par.Overall, I don't think this is a good alternative option to Tayyabs. Suck it up in the queue over there.",

I agree with this as it's less of the boozy, loud, evening than you would have there. That said, the food just isn't quite there. The chops need to be grilled at a higher temperature to get some char on, the chicken is a little to rubbery (as if added to the sauce later on). Dry meat was tasty, but nothing on Tayyabs, and the tandoor naan was a little to toasty instead of soft and buttery.I would probably continue to choose Tayyabs over Needoo in the future based on the food alone. The sheek kebabs, and aubergine daal at Needoo are very tasty if you do go though.Guardian review: gu.com/p/2ba4c (Oct 2009)",

Thdy came very quickly and I dtarted, half way through the mainx came and the waiter proceeded to place them on the table! I explained that I was still eating my starters and he looked very put out when I asked him to take them away. I then had a wait when I finished the starter for the rest.

These are fought over whenever I am there and a real treat. Extra bonus is that it has a BYOB policy making a cheap dinner out for an amazing return.

I came with some locals so the treatment I received might have differed, but the staff here was super attentive to the point where he was hovering over us.The food here is soo yummy - nothing like anything I've had in the states before. I had the lamb (SO GOOD) and I never eat lamb.. had their curry stews which was delicious as well. Their garlic naan was alright.. I feel like I would've preferred if it was softer, but everything was good. It's considered a bit \"rough\" to the locals, but I honestly didn't think the place was that bad. I mean it wasn't a 5 star restaurant, but the food really made it worth it. It also costed about 35-40 pounds for 4 people and we ordered TONS. Would recommend!",

We then proceeded to go to the nearby Lahore Kebab House. There too was very busy. So we googled and found that this place was of similar train of thought. As I said from the start much similar than you'd realise. Of course this place is much smaller than the former two mentioned. Overall it was good. But like all three the test comparison is always to get some mixed grill starters as well as curries but it's al says the starters name the lamb chops that set the benchmark. Here the lamb chops were good. But still nothing beats those sizzling marinaded lamb chops from Tayyabs. If it's all you can think about when eating then you know it hasn't surpassed it. It's still nice tho. Just, it's not Tayyabs.",

    "text": "A friend first mentioned this place to me months ago when I said that I had been very impressed with Tayyabs. And when I needed a last minute option and Tayyabs proved too hard to book, I stumbled upon the name again and we were able to make a day-of booking for Saturday night here, which is also just conveniently located around the corner from Tayyabs. It was nowhere as packed as Tayyabs, but the room we dined in had a good number of people.The ambience is in between the canteen grunginess of Lahore and the relatively upscale decor of Tayyabs. The menu is just well-used laminated paper and a little gross to touch, but it is short and there weren't too many familiar Indian dishes that I could recognize. Luckily they have pictures, some parentheses after the name indicating things like (chickpeas) and (okra), and the server was very helpful and immediately named off some recommendations when I asked him about certain things.We ended up ordering the karahi chicken, special lahori chana (chick peas), and the mutter paneer (cheese & green peas). My favorite was the chicken, which had a lot of flavor, while the chickpeas were very filling with only some sauce, so I'd say that was my least favorite. Many tables ordered the lamb chops and those looked amazing, but it's a large order! We got the plain naan, garlic naan, and allo naan (which was filled with potato). The garlic was very similar to the plain naan so I don't think it is worth the extra price, and the potato was interesting but it was only sparsely stuffed and good but nothing spectacular.Overall I would say that Tayyabs is still my favorite by a long mile but this is a decent option.",

I have spent the best part of twenty years locked in an affair with Lahore Kebab House and Tayyabs - each with their charms and faults. But tonight I was with friends and they wanted to try somewhere new. \u00a0When it comes to Punjabi I don't do new....why would I?But Needoo's wasn't really new... this was a Tayyabs clone. Done well but not perfect. No queue, no licence and a short menu with the focus on grills. Ticked my boxes. Poppadoms and sauces were very good - better than Tayyabs actually but that wasn't why we were here. Lamb chops and seek kebabs plus roti followed. It was all fine...but not the real deal..seek kebabs just a bit too pattie like..not enough texture but spicing was good. Lamb chops - again tasty - but the grill needs to go up a notch - just not chargrilled enough. Sizzle plates but no sizzle....not hot enough to make the onions caramelised and no pungent aroma to entice you in. Fish masala was very very good - deep sauce and fish perfectly cooked - not dried out like I have encountered too many times before. So reason to visit again...The staff were great..we sat and drank our rum with them topping up the ice. It was great to kickback and take our time without waiters trying to free up the table.Overall very good - but not Tayyabs and Lahore good. Next time and there will be a next time despite the guilt I will explore the menu a bit deeper and beyond my trusted Punjabi favourites..",

There were always a few people there with the same idea of getting takeout and the restaurant itself looks huge with ample seating space.We ordered the butter chicken masala, pilau rice and a garlic naan. As usual for this type of restaurant, they gave us extra sauces and a small salad which we ended up setting aside. The chicken dish was quite different to what we were expecting. We are used to the creamier butter chicken which you get in New Zealand, but this may just be our misunderstanding. (The 'masala' in the name may be making it a different dish altogether, but that is just a guess.)The meal was fine and I have no complaints. The service was good too: the man taking my order was happy to answer my questions about the menu and did so with a smile. It is a solid choice for the area, but not a restaurant I would make a trip for.",

Nice touch with the bowls by the way. They were not stingy with the sauces like other places we've been to, and gave you more than enough to have with your meal as we had some leftover at the end. (I've had to scrape the sauce out at other joints). My boyfriend and I got the Mixed grill BBQ to start, which was delicious and came with a healthy serving of assorted chicken, lamb, and lamb chops. Yum! We then got the Lamb Biryani and a Saag Paneer to share, with a side of garlic naan. First, let me talk about the naan. Oh. My. Days. I never understood why some restaurants did not seem to understand the concept of garlic naan being garlicky enough? Should a garlic naan not be dripping with garlic? Needoo's did not disappoint, and there was enough buttery garlic smothered on the naan for even a garlic connoisseur like me to be satisfied. I'm sure the other patrons in the place could tell I was delighted by my not so subtle vocal interjections.The lamb biryani was tasty, not too spicy but just right, and came with a sauce on the side that had tender chunks of lamb in it. The Saag Paneer had a certain sweetness to it that I found lovely and different. All in all, I was the happy little Asian girl sat in the back, sweating spices and clutching her garlic naan while happily chowing down. Literally 6 hours after my meal, I still feel stuffed. Would recommend. Oh and be prepared for loud cheerful decor, lots of mirrors, and Bollywood music videos playing on the TV screens. Enjoy!",

Well, yesterday evening, at the stroke of 8pm, I devoured a DELICIOUS plate of Lamb Tikka, Chicken Tikka and Lamb Chops! I know I know...how can a humble plate of meats cause so much excitement? Well, allow me to enlighten you...The meats were delivered on a black clay platter, sizzling away on a bed of grilled onions. My face lit up with excitement, almost like a child as they received a big shiny Christmas present from Santa. My fork was braced in my right hand and without any hesitation i began to 'dig in'. The chicken was beautifully textured and flavoured, the lamb was perfectly tender and the lamb chops were simply delicious. The difference Needoos and other similar restaurants is that the prices are also very reasonable, and the quality is not compromised. To be perfectly honest, i love a curry, however i prefer the starters in these types of restaurant, and in Needoo's the starters certainly do NOT disappoint.I highly recommend this restaurant, enjoy your visit and i sincerely hope you enjoy the food as much as i did.Regards,Hermes Michael Solomonides",
