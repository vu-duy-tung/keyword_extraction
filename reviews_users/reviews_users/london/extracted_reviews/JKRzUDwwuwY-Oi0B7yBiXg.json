There are not many places to go for a drink in the area so this is certainly a popular one. The restaurant, which I have tried twice now, is highly disappointing: short and uninspiring menu, poor execution, not very tasting or enticing plates. Hopefully someone will hear this and work on upgrading the kitchen as with the location and space they have, they ought to do better. Note that there is a small terrasse at the back.",

The bad news is this is somewhat akin to saying that Whitechapel is the best place to get yourself murdered if you've a penchant for ghoulish crepuscular wanderings.Victoria is not an area gastronomically blessed lets face it and given the limitations of getting something edible at all the Phoenix suddenly takes on a rather better lustre than if it had been in say Shoreditch or Islington.On to the review. The food is rather hit and miss, but then friday lunch times can get very busy. The burgers are decent but vary between too pink and too burnt, a honeyed duck was sickly but I've had a lovely venison stew there.Beer is excellent with a guest ale or two usually present and lagers crisp and clean. Try and get the French waitress downstairs (not a euphemism), she's quick and charming, but there is a comedy value with some of the other waiting staff who specialise in a school of service that fits somewhere in between surly and rude; I personally think it's part of the reason I keep going back.",

There was an older couple reading papers on couches by a fireplace, office folk chatting over a butcher block table, brightly colored pennants trimming the ceiling. We had the friendly French waitress mentioned in other reviews, who humored our request to pour us something local. My beer and fish were very good.

This sometimes means that the clientel can be a little on the not particularly friendly side, but if you're there with your own group, that shouldn't be a problem. It is, as a result, slightly on the expensive side, but this can be overlooked in the summer when a chilled pint outside is a must. One of the better pubs in the area, The Pheonix has a good range of beers and wines, and certainly enough to keep you there til closing time. There's also a beer garden which has heaters if you want to brave the chill of a winter's evening in the open air. The staff are friendly, if not a little too relaxed when the bar's busy, and this helps to give the pub a warm atmosphere at the end of a long hard working day.",

But it did make lunch a bit of a pain when we were told out food would be half an hour. The staff were really polite though and got us a table quickly and pushed our order through so we weren't waiting ages. It was still a bit of a wait though and Qype Captain Rob was going to pass out if he didn't get some food in him. But the pub itself is really pleasant - very airy, but manages not to be clinical at the same time. The little outside garden bit is cute too. I'm informed that pubs in Victoria are rubbish (this might be true as I only know of ever being to one in this area before.) so this pub was a nice surprise. Not too sure about the food though. Poor Rob looked so disappointed with his lentil salad and it did look a bit rubbish. I shared half of my chicken with him it looked that meagre. But I'm not entirely sure the chicken was cooked. It tasted cooked, but it looked so pink I was scared. The waitress insisted it was fine and then walked off. Nice. But in fairness, it did taste ok, and my potato salad had capers in which distracted me. I don't feel sick yet I'm not sure if we had the best experience the pub can offer. If we'd had a bit longer it might have been better, but unless I was in the area I wouldn't rush back. I also apologise to Rob if I've accidentally given him food poisoning.",

But service is still poor, and it can take 20 minutes to finally get a drink.I haven't eaten here, so can't comment on the food. Instead, my experience of the Phoenix has been one of occasional venue for works drinks. And it's always been a consistent one. Firstly, it tends to get swamped by workers from the surrounding offices. That tends to mean standing room only. Perhaps more crucially though, it means it can take ages to get a drink.Recently my colleagues and I stopped by earlier in an attempt to beat the crowds. This we successfully did, but unfortunately the Phoenix had duly reduced the staff behind the bar, meaning service was just as slow. The quality of the service can be somewhat dopey too - on the same night I saw someone complaining that whiskey had been added to a drink instead of vodka, while on another night I had to yell to stop one of the bar staff from adding ice (??!!) to my stout.The Phoenix has improved its beer list, which is definitely an improvement from the Youngs-centric selection it had before. That, plus the pleasant interior just about secure it a 3 stars from me. The poor service prevents it from scoring any higher.",

Both meals were served promptly, tasted great and were nice and hot. The spice in the pot pie is a curry base making it just the thing after a long flight from the States. The beer selection has a lot of options on draft and the wine menu has been carefully selected to ensure a great variety. Sit in the back for an intimate meal and try the cheese plate for dessert!",

And when I went to ask for a table to sit and eat I was first ignored by a pompous server, then judged as though I just wanted to sit and not eat, and then again ignored when I asked if I wasn't welcome. So we chugged our over priced beers outside and left. This area has so much more to offer than unfriendly staff and a small menu so don't wast your time or money. \u00a0We just moved near by and will not be back and tell everyone to avoid like the plague.

Three nights later we were looking for a place to drop in and have a pint. \u00a0The place was just over half full. \u00a0The lone tv downstairs was showing something really boring so I asked if I could have it changed to the replay of the Lions/Springboks 2nd test that had played earlier that day. \u00a0Much to my delight they complied. \u00a0 About two hours later the staff rang a bell to signify that it was closing time. \u00a0In the US the bell usually means last call for alcohol, but who were we to argue.",

    "text": "What a shame!The place is very nice. Central, right round the corner from Buckingham palace, near to everything.But come on people! It is easter monday and tourists are around!No burgers at all!A super tiny menu.Every course was with lamb (none in my family eats lamb)If you want something that is not lamb there is a vegetarian pie, some starters and an hamburger...but sadly no hamburger for us today as they had finished them already as it is Monday. WTF?Very bad!At leas the beer we took was nice...I don't think i will go there again to give them another chance! It has been so disappointing!If you want to grab a beer is fine but for having a lunch i am sorry but is not.Hope you will enjoy the place more than i did!",

Everyone so courteous.This was our first meal in the UK.I have to say, it was very middle of the road food, what you would expect in the states for a 3 star place.I think I had better fish and chips in the California for much less.Our meal came at around 30 pounds or $45. It's a lot. We passed by this place many times during our stay and in the evenings it has \u00a0a lot of people hanging out! \u00a0I would definitely say it is not a must-see if you're visiting.",

    "text": "Standard pub but with decent food and a good amount of space.Food: 3.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 4Return worthiness: sureEve award: best pubified fried cauliflower Highlights:- Cauliflower: surprise highlight in the sampler platter being deep fried to browned perfection. Delicious. It impersonates a chicken wing in form so I found that entertaining.- Cheese and bacon wedges: just like you'd expect for satisfying pub food but the quality version- Menu: more than just the standard fish and chips. Many items sounded pretty good and a bit fancified.- Bartenders: friendly and not hard to get their attention. Evelyn rules :-)- Decent selection of items outside of beer: liquor, wine, etc- Roomy: lots of space up top and nice booths for our group up frontMidlights:- Mac and cheese: not amazing but not bad. Served in a small ramekin.Lowlights:- Nachos: big flour chips like what you would find as a shell in a taco salad so very greasy- Closes early: like most pubs, they shoo you out at 11pmHad a good time here with my friends a few times during our visit.",

Bar staff offered us another - but what is the point if they're all as flat as each other? Avoid this, there's a dozen other pubs within a few minutes walk. They've recently refurbished the place and it looks great too, so shame about the drinks.",
