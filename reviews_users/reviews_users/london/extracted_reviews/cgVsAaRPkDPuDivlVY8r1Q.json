And I've pretty much never left.With worn decor that makes you feel instantly at home and a great mix of old East-London geezers and cute young men, it really is a little gem.Fabulously charming in a non-pretentious, anti-Shoreditchian way, The Owl and the Pussycat is the kind of pub you meet a friend with for a 'quiet drink' after work, and end up rolling out of at closing time. \u00a0Or maybe that's just me.",

    "text": "So an owl and a pussycat walk into a bar. They have some sort of sticky, sweet substance, and a shed load of moolah. They've been on a long journey in a vessel the colour of a legume. How happy they must have been to stumble into this establishment, with its lovely outside seating area and cheap drinks. Happy, that is, until the owners shot them and pinned them to the wall, along with the other owl and pussycat themed paraphernalia which adorns every surface of this Shoreditch hotspot. Yes, the Owl and the Pussycat is another of those old school, traditional pubs which has become the boozer of choice for the cool kids. But don't let that put you off; this place is much less overbearingly hip than many similar establishments in the area, and still maintains the feeling of a quirky local filled with quirky locals. The prices are very reasonable, that beer garden really is lovely and sedate- although if you're looking for a more dangerous al fresco drinking experience you can sit in the street outside and try playing chicken with the infrequent passing traffic- and the bar staff are older than the Edward Lear poem that gives this pub its name, giving it some extra charm. Minus points have to be given for the slightly fragrant toilets, but overall this is a perfect location for a few quiet drinks or a spot of pre-club lubrication, provided you aren't of the feline or avian persuasion.",

    "text": "This traditional pub, once the cherished watering hole of real old east end geezers, has become the adopted hangout of new meeja blokes who treat it as the 'genuine article' among the plethora of stylish new bars that now dominate shoreditch. However, this doesn't seem to have gone to the Owl's head at all. It still has a blackboard full of indigestible pub grub which show no pretensions to 'gastropub' status. No, it's doorstep white bread sandwiches or lasagne and chips type fare here. The tiny kitchen can struggle to serve the whole pub when it's packed out on a summer's day, so you can find yourself waiting and waiting. Better to just go for a drink and pick up a sandwich on the way back to work (more digestible too). The pub garden out the back provides welcome seating and fresh air when the sun's out, but it can get very full. Screens for football matches have also been introduced inside to please the masses.",

Before reviewing I think it's important to mention that this is another pub that is likely to not be here in about 6 months. There is a big development going on in the area and I think this pub is going to go in that development, which for me is a real shame. (I'm not 100% on this..maybe someone else knows on here?) It's really just a traditional English pub, with a garden out the back and a decent sized room upstairs. It's about as good an example of an English pub as you could get and yes the landlord may look like a sourpuss, but he is friendly enough in a gruff way and service gets the job done well in my view. Also has a billiard table and TV. Good atmosphere from my experiences there - well worth a visit if you fancy something traditional in the land of all things skinny and angular. Oh and finally - great name for a pub!",

Tucked down a side street, this is a great East London boozer. On my visit the barmaid looked like Amy Winehouse, locals stagnated at the bar (moving only, and reluctantly, to smoke), coats were piled high on the billiards table and advertising types discussed whether or not they knew how to play. Conclusion: they didn't. This pub made for good post work times. It was busy - but the wait for a drink was never too long, and as the staff were cheery and looked busy, I could quite happily wait a few moments longer. This pub ain't big and it ain't clever, but it's full of people and laughter and made the perfect springboard to the rest of my night.",

Obviously everyone will have a different opinion I suppose, but I must admit I relish its old school and slightly tattered charms (although the gents toilet could use a deodorizer or something). The landlord is a friendly enough fellow, and even chatted with my Dad and I for a bit about country music and opera. Gruff yes, but not unfriendly and also not without a good sense of humor. Importantly, I have never had a bad or questionable pint poured from the taps.",

Just a pub. It serves good beer. You can sometimes find a place to sit. The carpet sticks reassuringly to the soles of your shoes. And on a good day the barman will acknowledge your existence with a surly grunt. Perfect! It's got a beer garden full of smokers. In the old days they used to sit inside creating a collective smog of asthmatic-repellent. There's a piano in the corner that I've never had the nerve to open the lid of and a wonderfully old-fashioned bar billiards table. But it's the atmosphere that makes this place special. These other (s)wanky bars in the area might have helped a posh interior designer buy yet another Bentley - but they can't buy a vibe like this.",

Saying that, there is a nice little beer garden out the back for the occassional summer day beer. Also, it tends to be a post-private view haunt for arty people in the area.

    "text": "Gratitude is a strange thing. You'd think that this pub's inimitable location, genuine east end pub furnishings and proximity to what is only going to grow as a big spending area that the publican of this building would manage to raise the odd smile. Instead, on every occasion Pandyman has visited this place (i'll call it it a pub through gritted teeth if you insist) the landlord has been the most miserly scrooge one could image. He seems almost bitter that his pub is regularly packed out, albeit with the media types that Pandyman despises so much, despite living in their social and economical epicentre (I'm just around the corner) Such is life, but, Squire, please have the heart to recognise a man who likes an ale and a table with equal distaste for all that is the la de da of media darlings grouped around their oversized wine glasses and far too tight trousers (how do they piss? Answers on a post card.) Instead I am far too often treated to the grimace he serves these types with and against all the force of my charming, overpowering, nay, indestructible socially levelling banter. Such is life. So it goes. Pandyman verdict: if you must come here, and, as my proper local, I occasionaly must, then do so with the following caveats. Your service will be terrible, you will wait for some time and receive no quarter or apology for lack of speediness. You may, as I have, receive aggressive attitude from the locals, or be forced to talk about digital platforms with a man who designs purple suits with far too many pockets. Suh is life, so it goes. On the other hand, you'll get a pint, there's a TV and an outside smoking area. Bogs are so- so (access to the ladies for the purposes of this review has proved troublesome despite repeated entry attempts by the Pandyman) This may cause you to leave and never return, casting oaths into the night's sky to join the general accord of vomiting oiks, lost locals looking remarkably like disappearing amazonian tribes in a sea of mediocre unformity all encompassed by the gentle wash of police sirens heading for trouble in places with a real heart and soul, with all the attendant problems therein.

The meat was perfectly cooked and the veg and yorkshire were excellent.Unfortunately due to a mix up our dinners arrived a bit late and were not the hotest. They were ok to start with but quickly cooled. However I imagine if it had been piping hot at the start I might very well have agreed with them as it was excellent.Apart from that worth a visit!

They also do a tasty Sunday roast, although I still recommend Lock Tavern in Camden as the number one for Sunday pub roasts. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, drinks that aren't too overpriced - all round winner!",

It really shouldn't work but it does.The Owl & Pussycat is my local, a pub located just a few doors down from the baroque Lounge Lover bar and the kind of haunt that Shoreditch is famed for. There's nothing particularly outstanding about this unprepossessing little East End boozer except the fact that it is, quite literally, more than the sum of its sub-par parts.With a cute beer garden and just a handful of tables, The Owl & the Pussycat is inclined to become so busy that you might wish to crowd surf out of it. Invariably there is one member of bar staff on which means that it can take a long, loooooong time to get served but somehow it's worth it.The Owl and the Pussycat may be a bit of a dive but it's my local dive and I love it.",

I ordered the chicken and the beef roasts and liked both, although I'd recommend the chicken since the meat was cooked to a much more tender and juicy state.Both dishes arrived with parsnips, carrots, kale, potatoes and a large Yorkshire pudding, all drizzled in a tasty gravy sauce and the chicken option also came with a bread sauce. I left that alone though, much preferring the signature brown gravy sauce. I don't think a pub can get more British than this - the name \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" itself screams quirky English. I had an enjoyable dining experience overall.",

(yes, there is always a BUT!) the food is sadly distinctly average... in fact, I was wondering if the roast beef lunch I had on the Sunday was any better than the roast dinners I had back in primary school....So here I was, back in Shoreditch for another lazy Sunday roast. Not my first choice of venue, but since everywhere was packed and my friend was feeling poorly and restrained to Shoreditch by an invisible elastic band, \u00a0we made the decision to resort to Choice F on the list. If you have been to the Owl and the Pussycat before, you'll know that it's almost a Shoreditch institution on Redchurch Street. It's a great low-key drinking establishment, with the usual Shoreditch hipsters, but for food? It was a huge let down I'm afraid.",

You need more gravy for a yorkshire that size! And a damn good yorkshire it was too.Took a star away partly because of the roast, but mainly because at one stage all the staff behind the bar in a very animated conversation (I mean animated, arms were a flailing), when at least one of them was meant to be making two bloody marys for people in our group. The drinks were promptly brought over once the staff were finished their discussion. The report on the Bloody Mary? OK, too much spice particularly worcester sauce. So if you do order one, ask for half the spice. They do accommodate this.",

Even so, there wasn't an issue with getting a drink and the service was good.Price wise it is fairly competitive and even though I didn't eat I did see plenty of burgers coming out of the kitchen and these looked really tasty and seemed to provide value for money.Even better is the quiz night on a Tuesday.

And all of us got a drink of our choice for free!Everything tasted very good....the burger was awesome !And the atmosphere was best...good music and nice drinks.So it was a bit difficult start but in the end we had a lot of fun.Prices were ok....typical London.I will definitely come back ! ;)",

He assured me that I would love the food and that I would trust his opinion much more after eating here, which I do.Owl & Pussycat is dark, barely considered even dimly lit. We grabbed a small table that held a bucket of condiments and a pink flower in the front room, but it seems that there are larger rooms in the back (and quite possibly even outside). The front room had small tables right by the bar, and I could see that another room consisted of booths and sofas for those who choose to lounge and get a little closer. After settling down, we decided to order a lamb dish, mussels, and duck fat chips. Everything arrived at our table simple and beautifully prepared. Without even tasting the lamb, we both knew that it would melt as soon as it hit our mouths. The scent of it carried and people walking in peeked over our shoulders and headed to the bar, pointing over at us, mouthing the words \"i want that.\" The mussels came out in a large steaming bowl, drenched in a butter, garlic, and white wine sauce that I doubt anyone but the chef could perfect. I savored each little mussel and even tried to drink the soup (sauce) before my friend stopped me and told me that it was \"weird\". The Duck Fat Chips were a side dish, and I am glad we had ordered them. Before these babies, I had always thought chips were chips, whichever way you cooked them or seasoned them. Wrong - there is a difference. We left completely satisfied and agreed that it was a hit, not a miss. The menu, I think, changes from time to time. This doesn't matter, though, as I am confident that everything is delicious.",

In winter, the open fire is the perfect spot for a glass of red wine.
