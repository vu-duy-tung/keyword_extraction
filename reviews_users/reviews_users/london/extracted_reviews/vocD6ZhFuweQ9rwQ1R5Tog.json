    "text": "Bierodrome impressed me on a Saturday afternoon. \u00a0When we arrived, it was virtually empty. \u00a0As much as I like a quiet environment, it was almost too quiet. \u00a0But more people showed up shortly thereafter. \u00a0The bar area was equipped with plenty of comfortable seating: numerous plush couches and chairs, booths, tables . . . not like some bars with that one lone couch that everyone's vying for. \u00a0The set up of some of the couch/chair seating areas would be particularly good for large groups. \u00a0The dining area proper was tucked away to a side corner, so the Bierodrome was definitely more bar-centred than it was restaurant-centred. \u00a0I appreciated this, as I came for one thing and one thing only. \u00a0Beer.The drinks list mimics that at Belgo Centraal around the corner, so I tried the Mongozo Coconut (yummy), a Hoegaarden (. . . it was a Hoegaarden) and a Floris Chocolate (decidedly foul, but I cannot blame Bierodrome for my poor beer decisions). \u00a0Husbatron got an Orval, a Kwak and a Duvel. \u00a0I didn't hear any complaints from him, but that might just be because he got a bit drunk on the crazy Belgian ABV, thus compromising any chance of a truly objective critique.Even though I know this place can get really busy on weeknights because of the professional post-office crowd, it was quite relaxed and enjoyable in the middle of the afternoon on the weekend. \u00a0As a bonus, if you're not in the mood for a full meal, a small assortment of bar snacks is also on offer.I was somewhat surprised that the location didn't have the industrial vibe of other Belgo locations, but I soon discovered that the WCs on the lower ground floor carried over this theme (a little bit odd, but hey ho). \u00a0You see, the ground floor did not; it was rather modern and swank. \u00a0As I walked down the stairs, it almost looked like I was walking into their beer cellar, with kegs lining the walls. \u00a0Around the corner, the toilet was well equipped, but I couldn't help but dislike the full-size picture of a leggy Belgian model in a babydoll dress on the back of the stall door, smiling at me whilst I minded my own business on the loo, as if saying, 'You're in here for the third time already; maybe it's because you're binge drinking, you cow'. \u00a0 Yeah, didn't like that.",

I naturally opted for the bowl of Marini\u00e8re mussels with fries. The mussels were steamed with white wine, garlic, cream, onion and celery, and was satisfying following a slightly longer than anticipated wait. The fries were naturally as crispy as the ones I had whilst in Brussels three years ago. Oh what memories A good selection of beers including various fruit beers makes this a popular watering hole amongst my colleagues.",

    "text": "This is a smaller branch of Belgo's and seems to be more of a drinking establishment than a restaurant. Not the most ideal place to go to in large groups - expect to be split across a couple of tables if you do. Just one thing to keep in mind when you eat at this place - order mussels, lots of it, relish the sauces and order some good fruit beer to top it all off. Nothing too hard to remember, eh?Both my visits to this branch involved a kilo of mussells each, soaked and doused in Thai Green sauce and complemented by sweet beers such as mango and strawberry beer. Conversation came to a grinding halt both times as hungry friends dug into individual shells to pick out the tender flesh, drink off the sauce as it messily dripped off the shells and discarded the empty shells, only to go again. It is not an easy process, and you do feel like you've earned your meal by the time you make your way through it. But it's well worth the effort. The frites served with the mussels are mostly of the 'meh' variety, better than McD's fries but that's not saying much. I would have preferred a side of bread to soak up the sauces at the bottom of the dish after all the mussels are cleared out. The prices are alright for a centrally located food joint serving up atypical dishes - I expect I'll go again. It's a good spot on Sundays for a quiet-ish lunch.",

    "text": "It may mask itself with another name but the Bierodrome is just another eatery from the Belgo chain, and that is not a bad thing. So on a fine Friday evening, after having worked my 8 hours in our sweltering office, I headed off here with a few friends. Setting - Nice setting if a little cramped and a bit on the loud side. This is a bar/restaurant so there is music, loud music and this is what knocks off that star. I want to be able to talk while waiting for food, especially if I haven't seen my fellow diners in a while, and this is made difficult due to the over bearing music. Service - We had a very friendly, smiley, cute girl who had just started her first shift so service didn't flow as we had to point out what we wanted from the menu but this is not a bad thing as I am happy to accommodate someone on their first shift. But after orders were made the service was quick and our waitress was always easy to get a hold of so it balances out.Food & Drink - For starters I had to have the mussels. The first time I ever tried mussels was when I went to the Belgo Centraal and so I knew I had to have it this time. The Mussels in white wine sauce were lovely and a must have, the sauce was just divine, truly divine. My mains was meant to be the wild boar sausages with mash but due to the newness of the waitress she got our order wrong and I ended up with the pork and leak sausages. This wasn't a bad thing as it was still a truly delicious meal, though the side of chips I ordered were a bit over cooked, and I would recommend this to someone going to the restaurant. After all the food I still had a little room for dessert and decided on the Strawberry pavlova, which I can't fault. It was the right consistency and had a good helping of fresh strawberries and strawberry sauce with it. One of the main reasons I love this chain of restaurants is due to the huge beer selection and on this day I had a half of raspberry beer which was one of the loveliest things I have ever tasted and a mango beer which was the most refreshing alcoholic drink I have ever had pass my lips. I wish more places had this wide selection of beers. Overall - A very good experience and I will be returning here again for those lovely mussels.",

The service is a bit rubbish - ask a waiter for anything at your table and you'll be brusquely sent to the bar. The chairs are reasonably comfortable, but the decor isn't anything special. On the whole, if you want to go to drink Belgian beers, you'd do far better to head just up the road to the Dovetail in Farringdon, which has very friendly knowledgeable staff, a very nice authentic decor, and really good, excellent value food.",

We decided to go there on a weeknight for an offer they have on called Beat the clock, which is basically paying the price of the time you order e.g. order at 6 o'clock and pay \u00a36!. As we all got there different times I was the last to order. Having seen the portion of mussels (which I am told were ever so tasty) and chicken I think I expected mine to be a decent size too alas if you want a decent size meal don't order the roast vegetable tartlet with goats cheese and light tomato coulis. Not saying it wasn't tasty - just that it was average and nothing spectacular. The sauce was just like a light and watered down tomato mascarpone. This place was also rather busy and didn't seem overly organised - though it could have just been the night. I am not writing them off the list of places to go after work around the area.",

Firstly the beers are excellent, it's pretty fun to have a friend pick the weirdest sounding beer for you to drink and working your way through the list; lots of choice and interesting glasses etc. The food I'd characterise as over-priced and under-par. Snacks are fine (fried chorizo in particular) to wash down with the beer but anything else is beyond their capabilities. Staff aren't so friendly or knowledgeable (perhaps because of the heavy turn over). Only choose this place if you like interesting beers.",

    "text": "When the craving for moules frites strikes, it makes sense to head to a Belgian restaurant for satisfaction. Naturally, one of the first that comes to mind in London is the Belgo chain and, while it may not be the best there is, it is cheap and cheerful and always has space for a group.The Kingsway branch is just around the corner from the Centraal location in Seven Dials. It's not as \u00a0cool as its hipster sibling, but then again it's designed to cater to hordes of hungry students from next door LSE. Unfortunately, it seems to have too many hallmarks of a school cafeteria for my liking.We arrived on time for our reservation and had to wait a few minutes for them to wipe down the table. Not a big deal except the table had been empty for a while so why don't they clean faster than that? The four small tables that comprised our table for 8 were also of different heights. While all were suitable, it just looks odd and it strikes me as a better idea to match up 4 tables of the same height rather than two groups of uneven eating surfaces.Naturally, I wanted to get the moules and opted for a kilo pot with the Thai sauce. The mussels were cooked well and almost completely clean of grit which was a shellfish win for Belgo Kingsway. They were a bit small for my liking and I wonder if that's because they are out of season or if Belgo can afford to have low prices by avoiding the premium big shell mussels. But that's a minor issue compared to the lack of flavour in their sauce. When I get Thai, I expect bold green curry flavours, plenty of spice, and smoothness from the coconut milk and lemongrass. What I got was a watery broth with just a hint of sweetness and no spice or full flavour whatsoever. In fact, I think it was mainly butter and water with a touch of coconut milk. Not cool, Belgo, not cool at all.The frites were average and not much to talk about. I think when they represent a key part of your core offering, you need to spend a little time getting the frites right. Hell, McD's can do some decent skinny fries and they only charge a quid for them!The final straw was the unbearable heat of the restaurant. Given it was a relatively warm night (especially for December), there was no reason to crank the heat up. The end result was our group shovelling the food down in order to get out into the cooler air. I'm not one usually to complain but I know this review sounds like a bit of whinge. The main takeaway was that we went in expecting a nice relaxed meal and it ended up being a depressing and quickly ended attempt. At least the company was good! I won't be back and will give Belgo one more chance, but at their Centraal location I think as I couldn't take another sauna experience!",

First off, believe what people tell you when they say the service needs work. We sat down and waited 20 minutes before they even took our drinks order. Oh boy. We were in it for the long haul. Despite it being the place for mussels, I'm not a big mussels fan so I opted for the rotisserie chicken. I've had it before and always enjoy it, but this time around, it came out with the skin burnt... not that appetizing. We asked for ketchup and mayo to go with the chips, they brought out the mayo asap, said the ketchup would come out in a minute and forgot. We had to ask again. The beers are great (can't go wrong with Belgian beer) and the dessert was delicious (had the berry pavlova... mmmm), but this place needs to work on its service. I'll stick with Belgo Centraal, thanks.",

No, not an obvious student hangout, but at the time it was styled as a Bierodrome (exactly the same, just more students) and we came for the Belgian beers. Nowadays I tend to come for the mussels, which are consistently good (at all Belgo locations, I find). In particular between 6 and 7pm when they charge you the time (i.e. 6 quid at 6pm) for moules frites. A couple of other dishes are on the special offer menu but gone are the good old days where everything was included. The frites aren't really frites but they're gooood. The beer selection is huge, and expensive, though some of it is so strong you probably save money... It's one of those places where you can sit and eat and drink and then get a bit of a shock when your tab need settling. However, Belgo is Belgo and there isn't anywhere else quite like it (or if there is, please tell me). Why 3 stars? This Belgo doesn't have as nice an atmosphere or setting as Centrale or Upper Street branches. It tends to get inundated with after work drinkers who stand annoyingly in the way by the bar. The soap in the bathroom smells utterly vile.",

It doesn't have the same vibe as Bierodrome in Islington but at least you can talk with your friends while relaxing and enjoying the great beers. More of a discerning crowd but I heard it gets more rowdy during the week. I've only ever been here on weekends and its usually quiet though last Saturday it was busy from the evening right through to my nineth beer :) around 11pm.Another great selection of Belguim's finest in particular the king of beers - De Koninck on tap. Hail to the king!Other notable beers are Affligem, Brugse Zot and Satan Gold (bottle only).The mussels are excellent my favs are Marini\u00e8re and Florentine but I will try the Mediterranean when I'm next in town.",

    "text": "I really like the mussels and the beer at Belgo so I've been to the Belgo Centraal a few times. This time I had the Provencal mussels. The broth was a little bland compared to the one I've had before at Centraal and I was a little disappointed that they'd taken the kimchee moules off the menu but the mussels themselves were still good. Generally the food was decent and my husband and brother in law ordered the bubble waffle which was delicious. The problem came with the service. Generally the service was slow which I could live with but when it came to paying for the bill I tried to use my voucher 'The Restaurant Card' that i'd bought from Perkbox. This was two vouchers that I'd already spent \u00a367.50 for to get \u00a375 of credit. Initially the servers refused to accept the vouchers. They said that they no longer had a deal with The Restaurant Card. However, on Perkbox's website it still says that you can buy this voucher to use at Belgo so maybe they should inform everyone else. The servers pointed out that the expiry date on the vouchers was passed which was true but Perkbox transitioned their website over to a new one which made the dates wrong, the vouchers were supposed to be valid for 24 months. I had an e-mail from Perkbox confirming that the vouchers were not expired. The servers then said they would accept the voucher worth \u00a325 which was odd as that was the 1st voucher I'd bought and it was clear that they just didn't want to accept the \u00a350 voucher. I complained about this, not in a rude manner and the servers eventually discounted both from the bill. However, in bringing the final bill over, they decided to slam it on the table as if we'd insulted them personally. I do like the concept and the food at Belgo but every time I go there we seem to have a bad experience with the service so it's putting me off going back there again.",

Only partially because I am always near it.This location can be less busy that others during the day, but does get quite crowded during the evenings. The crowd varies, it is close to the major uni's so sometimes it is full of younger students, and other times not. The menu recently changed, which in my opinion was a mistake. I used to LOVE their homemade sausage and mash. They still have Tuesday night Moules night, which is incredible, so all is forgiven. What I really like about this place is all the different Belgium beers - and every beer has its own glass!! My fav is the Quwak, not only is the beer amazing but its served in a glass that looks like a mad scientist test tube.All in all its a great place to stop for lunch in the day, or drinks and dinner at night. I would suggest making reservations if you plan on coming in past 8 as tables go like hot cakes.",

The reason I can't award the 5th star is because the mussels were just ok. If they matched the outstanding beer selection and service it would be 5 stars all the way. Still, a cool place to go especially if you enjoy Belgium beer and a fun embiance.",

    "text": "For Central London, Belgo represents surprisingly good value -- in particular the happy hour meal choices from 5 to 7 PM where you pay the price on the clock. A good deal at 7 PM, a stunning deal at 5 PM. Beers are delicious, too.Would not hesitate to return -- for cheaper than the kebab joint down the street you can get a proper meal with a beer.Good stuff.",

    "text": "The \u00a36.95 lunch menu is great value, and while the moules frites weren't outstanding (something about the frites was a little bit off, as other reviewers have said) this is a really great option if you happen to be in the area. I particularly liked the celery in the sauce, which gave it extra flavour and texture. Those of us drinking got lucky because they were trialling a new beer at just \u00a32 extra with the lunch menu. Random point - they also have a really user friendly website. I don't know why 99% of restaurant websites feature pointless graphics that take forever to load, .pdf menus, and the location page about 19 clicks away, but Belgo's is actually designed to help customers!",

    "text": "Was excited about trying Belgian food since I didn't really know what that is, but I'm not really a fan of this place. \u00a0Their menu lacked any appeal and the service was a bit slow when we first sat down, even though the place was pretty empty. \u00a0The menu mostly consisted of burgers, roast chicken, and a variety of seafood dishes. \u00a0I was mostly unimpressed because I can easily make burgers and roast chicken myself (not that I would or will anytime soon...) but the point is that I really don't want to pay \u00a311 for half a fancy chicken. \u00a0There was 5 of us and we all ordered different things, but no one really enjoyed their meal except one person, who got the Poppei Moules platter, which are basically mussles and fries (aka. chips). I got the spinach and creme fraiche tartlett, which was alright but definitely NOT worth \u00a38. \u00a0Another one also got a pasta of some sort, off the Express Lunch menu, which he devoured but said it was pretty forgettable.I think I have to get a better idea of what Belgian food actually is before I make any further decisions about it, but I probably won't be doing it here. I thought the entire Belgian diet consisted of chocolate, fries, and waffles. \u00a0Who knew there was more?! I found the idea of Express belgian food kind of intriguing, as Belgian food is lacking pretty much everywhere else in the world. \u00a0Guess I'll just have to take a trip to Belgium and see for myself what it's really about!",
