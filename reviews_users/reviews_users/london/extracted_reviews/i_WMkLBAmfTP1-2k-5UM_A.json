    "text": "In a word: gluttonous. If ever the infamous \"super-size\" yet supposedly regular American size burger hit the UK dining experience it has taken the shape of a Five Guys burger.Forgetting to order a small burger I received the diner's standard of a double beef patty with my request of onions, lettuce, pickles and tomatoes all wrapped in a silver lining of foil and shoved in a grease-blotted brown paper bag. Luckily I was told that one portion of fries was enough for two, so me and my partner shared a bag heaped with cajun fries. The restaurant has a downstairs seating area which was really quiet so we headed straight down after noticing how busy it was on the ground floor. Dotted around the place are also huge bags of free monkey nuts so go mad. When it comes to drinks the diner has an impressive drinks dispenser that brags over 100 Coca-Cola beverages. We took advantage of this and made a few amateur mocktails (why not?) that worked like a sweet, sweet fizz to wash down our immense meal of meat and potatoes. Naturally my burger fell apart making it somewhat difficult to eat it in a more civilized manor but I guess I can't really complain. My meal was delicious, filling and oh so meaty. But I can't nudge the feeling that it may, in fact, be very, very bad for me in the long run if I were to make Five Guys a regular lunch/dinner choice. I would say it's definitely a one-off kinda deal (for me anyway).",

    "text": "I've not visited Five Guys in the US, but have heard great things. When I heard they were opening on the same weekend as Shake Shack, it was hard to decide which to visit first. In the end, I went to both on the opening weekend.Sadly, Five Guys was very disappointing. I was expecting great things, but it just didn't deliver. The burgers were dry and bland, the fries far too greasy (although the portion sizes were generous). Service was very impersonal - at one point we were given the wrong order, and found it impossible to get the attention of any staff to hand it back and get it to the right person (you place your order, get a number and wait to be called - we misheard the number and no one else stepped forward).This could be excusable, because Five Guys is very much a fast food joint, if it weren't for the prices, which are comparable to places like Honest Burgers, Patty & Bun, Byron and Meat Liquor.I'll probably give them another go at some point - but only if I'm a hurry and can't face McDonalds.",

Did not find it outstanding in any way and was also quite expensive for the quality. Interior is very red and music was loud.. I think this is meant to get people in and out of the place as quickly as possible. Definitely worth experiencing, if only once.",

    "text": "Yes, I know that its really really easy to give an American burger chain a 1 star review. Yes, I also know that loads of people won't get further than seeing 1 star and start thinking yada yada yada. I've tried to be throughly honest and 5 Guys IS a 1 star establishment..... let me explain!5 Guys has a door person whom I suspect is there solely to help you negotiate the strategically placed sacks of potatoes placed on the floor well that or there scared they'll get sued if anyone trips over them. The Hard Rock Cafe has guitars on the wall... 5 Guys has spuds on the floor. It being a 3pm on a tuesday it was pretty dead so spent a few minutes pursuing the menu. As others have said or alluded to the prices are at the absolute top end of the price spectrum. That in itself isn't a problem but I did wonder how I was meant to take away a \u00a35 (.... yes \u00a35!!!) large portion of fries as I didn't have a wheelbarrow with me come to think of it I wasn't with 3 friends who'd have to help me get through \u00a35 WORTH of fries!Anyway a Cheese burger, large fries and a regular coke was \u00a315.50. Sorry people but I just wasn't going to spend that so decided on a hamburger. 2 slices of what appeared to be kraft singles (20 pence?) that constituted a cheese burger would add \u00a31.25. I hate carbonated drinks so skipped that and seeing the fries sitting under a heat lamp didn't endear me to spending \u00a32.75 \u00a0on a \"small\" portion of them.The man that took my order \" 1 hamburger, please\" seemed really proud of the company USP that all topping are free!!!! A quick word to the 5 Guys US marketing team....5 Guys = \"As many FREE toppings as you want\" Translated for the UK = \"Your paying for them whether your having them or not!\" As I said it wasn't busy so I got to talk to my server and obviously the topic of price came up. The reason (as he told me) that 5 Guys is soo expensive compared to say McD's is that the dastardly Ronald McD uses frozen patties whereas 5 Guys only use non-frozen patties. \u00a0He also confirmed that some of the staff despite a cheese burger, large fries and a medium coke costing \u00a315.50 were on MINIMUM WAGE i.e. they can't legally pay them any less.Anyway it was good to be able to pass the time chatting because this is most definitely NOT fast food. From ordering to the point I was handed my burger it took just over 11 minutes.... eeeek!!Right to the meat of the review how was the burger?In these eco-friendly days of swimming with dolphins and composting toilets I was surprised to find my burger was handed to me in a paper bag despite asking to eat in. I was even more surprised to find the actual burger wrapped in tin foil! On unwrapping I have to say its not a pretty burger. On picking it up a fair bit of the topping fell out (I had the ketchup and \"mayonnaise\" left out as I hate slop) I was also hugely surprised to find that the bun felt like \"wonder bread\" I was expecting something more bready for \u00a36.75.First bite.... bun melted into nothingness followed by an ice cube cold slice of tomato then the hot burger meat. If I didn't know what I was eating I'd have said it was a Subway sandwich (at half the price!). I did pinch a bit of the meat off to taste it on its own but sorry 5 Guys although it was more juicy (fatty) than a McD's purely on taste? nothing in it. \u00a0The overwhelming feeling eating the burger was this conflict of ice cold salad items tomato, lettuce etc fighting with the super hot burger meat. Really unpleasant!My gut feeling is that anyone that uses lots of filling/ingredients is only doing it to hide general blandness. If 5 Guys thinks it has such a great quality product why is it treating it as a commodity? Would you serve a top quality cheese straight out of the fridge?I suspect that 5 Guys will find its UK offerings super profitable but its hard not to think that its customers and staff aren't being short changed.As I said a very definate 1 Star establishment",

I feel bad for asking my friend to take me there for my birthday treat. The fries managed to be crispy and limp at the same time and the burgers were just a Macdonalds burger on steroids. There is a reason why the main comparison in most reviews is with Macdonalds. Which has surely got to ring some alarm bells? I realise Five Guys is supposed to be a fast food experience but it took just as long as a similarly priced sit-down burger meal. So why do they charge sit down prices for fast food burgers? I'm glad we were advised on the sizing of the fries as I rarely finish a portion - I didn't much fancy eating more than a few of these. The burger was very greasy and had a strange added beef taste rather than tasting like beef which I was expect from Mcdonalds etc. We had cheeseburgers and I added ketchup, mustard, pickles and mushrooms. All in all, in comparison to Macdonalds, Five Guys is excellent. However I can't compare it to Macdonalds as the price points are different. So to compare to similarly priced burgers? There is a huge problem.The drinks machine is groovy though.",

Perfect soft bread that hug the patties nicely. \u00a0The seasoning of the meat was perfect. \u00a0Not too salty nor bland. \u00a0The extras on my bacon cheeseburger were grilled mushroom, jalape\u00f1o, tomatoes, hot sauce and pickles. \u00a0Pondering on it, I think if I were to choose my last meal on earth, this one could come to mind.The challenge in multiplying branches of a successful company is that sometimes, the specialised process of creating the product becomes formulaic but subject to different results. \u00a0I was a little disheartened a few months ago when I visited a California branch of Five Guys in Fullerton. \u00a0The quality of my burger over there was somehow different. \u00a0It must have been an isolated case of lapse in quality control (I would hope). \u00a0I can gladly say that the London version totally reminded me of why I still rate Five Guys as one of my top burgers.",

    "text": "HELLO TOPPINGS. \u00a0I get really excited when I have the opportunity to customize my food.When I had my Five Guys obsession in the States, that was always one brownie point I appreciated. \u00a0I still preferred Shake Shack over Five Guys (get your soppy bun together though SS...), but I love that Five Guys' topping permutation can get quite eclectic. \u00a0You can choose regular/grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, tomato, lettuce, jalapeno, pickles, green peppers, relish, mayo, mustard, A1 sauce, HP sauce, BBQ sauce, Tabasco sauce, ketchup, or THE WORKS if you are greedy and want everything (done that and it gets messy).There was still a line to get into the restaurant at 10 pm but it went much quicker than the line at Shake Shack. \u00a0I chose the bacon cheeseburger (double patties, cheese, and bacon), regular sized Cajun fries (go for Cajun if you prefer spicy and seasoned fries), and fountain drink which I promptly filled up with Orange Coke Zero (unadvised) from the soda machine that churns out various flavors of your favorite Coca-Cola sponsored beverage. \u00a0All amounting to about 12 quid. \u00a0During the 10 minute wait to get my food, I hovered around the free peanuts but thought better of it as I had a feast awaiting.Upon receiving the meal, I was excited to see that bun was toasted even if it quickly became soppy after a few minutes. The burger was good, though I think the meat at Shake Shack tastes better. \u00a0The fries were a bit limp and sad. \u00a0They supposedly double/triple fry their fries, but the texture tends to be inconsistent.Overall I like Five Guys. \u00a0I'd just go for Shake Shack instead if I were in the area again.",

    "text": "i didn't actually mean to go to five guys when i did, it's been on my list of places to go since it's opening but i was actually on my way to chipotle when i happened upon it and seeing as there was no queue i thought i had to give it a go! first impressions were good, everything is decked out in classic american burger joint fare with red and white adoring everything plus a peanut barrel for the hungry hoards in the queues. the menu is fairly straightforward but one of Five Guys USPs is that all the toppings are free and you can order whatever combinations take your fancy. I opted for a cheeseburger 'all the way' which essentially means containing all of the top row (lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mushrooms, ketchup,mustard and mayo) but i asked for no mustard and extra hot sauce and jalapenos.Once unwrapped, the burger is pretty impressive. I hadn't realised but two patties is standard and the cheese literally oozes out between the meat in the most tempting way imaginable! The burgers are real juicy as well, be warned you'll need about 3 napkins to get through one of these beasts! Sadly the actual eating part wasn't great, the meat is under seasoned, the hot sauce was fairly mild and watery for \u00a310.50 i expected a lot better.Five Guys seemed a great place in theory but sadly didn't quite live up to the hype....",

    "text": "There's been quite a lot of hype around Five Guys, and well, I think much of it is justified. The interior may be similar to McDonalds in some ways, but in all other ways the comparison is completely off: the quality of the burger and chips is immeasurably better, and I love the option to order as many or as few sauces as one wants. The prices may be rather higher for the \u00a38 double patty burger, but it's very filling too (far more so than a Big Mac) - the smaller, single patty burger for \u00a35 should not be overlooked in your quest to satisfy your hunger. Five Guys also deserve credit for using and preparing their burgers freshly - something that McDonalds certainly cannot claim to do.There are oddities and inconveniences here too. Chief oddity is all the endorsements on the wall from little-known US regional publications.. circa 2008 (?!). Chief inconvenience is the wait, both to get into the restaurant (a rope and door attendant regulates access) and to be served. So you may want to pick your moment to sample what Five Guys have to offer. Overall though, Five Guys are definitely worth checking out. And as a new entry in London's already saturated burger market, that's saying something.",

I was so curious and joined that line of people to see what's special about this burger restaurant, and I must say that burgers here are not any more delicious than Burger King's. And the range of choices is disappointing, only 3 or 4 basic burgers (e.g. cheese, bacon and chesse) than \u00a0you get to select your toppings like cucumber, japalenos, mustard and stuff.Regarding the burger itself, it's just average quality for the price of \u00a38, the amount for which I could get more than \u00a0a meal with fries and drinks in Burger King with same level of deliciousness.If you'd like some free peanuts and try out the super-wide-range-soft drink machine though, you can try this place",

I ordered the hamburger (with lots of free additional toppings such as grilled onions, grilled tomatoes, pickle, etc.), the spicy fries and a refillable soft drink. The burger was tasty and quite big but it wasn't really anything special. The fries were very good, nice and crispy but not too much, and you got a lot for your money - I had a the smallest option. The drink on the other hand was Amazing!!! They have a drinks machine with 100 different flavours! Firstly I tried Raspberry Diet Coke, then Fruit punch Fanta, Peach Sprite, followed by Peach Fanta to compare and topped it off with a take out of grape Fanta - definitely my fav of the ones I tried. The price was reasonable (roughly around \u00a312.50 for burger, fries and a drink) and very central location. I would definitely recommend going here, my only tip would be to take small samples of the drinks then you can try them all without constantly going to the loo!!",

You won't regret itAs a non beef eater the only thing I could get was the bLT sandwich. Which is actually served as a burger as opposed to a sandwich. This is clearly a place of happy deception. Everything is done to one-up your expectations and it works! The wait system is exactly like Argos. So much better than the ludicrous shake shack waits. I literally saw my burger being prepared as I ordered it. With it only taking 20 secs from paying to picking it all up!The one downside was the new member of staff. It was hard getting them to understand what a BLT was despite pointing frantically at the menu above their heads and explaining what the letters were for. Additionally when I said all the toppings, they took this to mean literally every topping including all the sauces. I removed some but it appears sine got through leaving me with a weird tasting but absolutely delicious bacon burger. The bacon in my burger was extra crisp. Not how I normally like it, but fine for what it was. The rest of the experience was on par with my previous review and they've just opened a branch closer to me in Islington.

I came last weekend, but the line was too long - so I tried again today... and success!I was already expecting the burgers not to be as good as the ones in America, just because London is at the early stages of a burger revolution and the Five Guys model isn't completely replicable across the pond. But, that being said, it came very close.Burger (7/10) - I would give American Five Guys burgers an 8/10, and this one came very close, though it wasn't exactly the same. As Edward said, it's going to be a sloppy burger, it's going to be greasy... but it's going to also be very good. This is the way a proper American burger should be! Dripping in grease, mayo, mushroom juice, melted cheese... etc. I agree that the price is a bit punchy, but the same thing at other burger joints (e.g. Byron) are easily over \u00a315 per person for a lower quality burger.Fries (9/10) - This is where they got it right. The fries taste exactly the same as they do in the states. With the cajun seasoning, these babies are untouchable. Plus, you get the friendly extra scoop in the bag - so really you only need a small, and potentially a regular to split between two grown men. The taste is spot on, though you might need a drink handy.Drink fountain (10/10) - I was very worried that Five Guys would not bring the retro-futuristic drink fountains over... but they did! Over 100 different combinations of drinks you've only imagined at your fingertips. The only drawback is that the queue might get a bit long because there are so many choices and you want to try everything! In total it cost me \u00a0\u00a314.50 for a cheeseburger (double-patty), regular fries (enough to feed two), and a drink. Well worth it, and it's about the price that I would pay for this quality burger in London. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Update!Five Guys now serves shakes. Expensive shakes in gosh darn fancy flavours with a choice of bacon, yes, BACON. I'll try it if you promise not to judge me.I don't want to be the person rooting for the big guys and throwing the independent burger joints under the routemaster but this place is pretty good and I'm literally only taking away a star because the queues are ridiculous and there's basically never any seating and because it's pretty expensive for what it is... a glorified McDonalds.I came here on the behest of my partner who is American and a big fan of this place back home. Naturally, when I told her Shake Shack and Five Guys had branched out to the promised land, she insisted I go. Being an excellent girlfriend, I did! I had gone to Shake Shack before and didn't have high hopes for Five Guys. It seemed all was lost when the queue stretched for as far as the eye could see. OK, so it was contained within the premises but still, it was HUGE. I ordered a large fries, a bottomless drink and a standard burger with my choice of toppings... because you have the choice and it's all included in the price so go nuts people! It came to about \u00a312 altogether. While I waited for my order to be called I grabbed a drink from the self serve machines because, guys... let's be real, you need to drink as much as you can because that thing costs like \u00a33 so don't be insane and buy two if you're going with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Buy one and share because it's BOTTOMLESS. We all know you don't think it's gross so don't pretend! Grab some ketchup while you wait too. It took probably 10 minutes or so for my food to arrive and it was a pretty gruelling wait as I pranced around giving people death glares in the hopes of stealing a seat from one of the weaker patrons. I grabbed my food as soon as it was called up and sat back down, making sure to throw in a couple more stone cold glares just for good measure. What can I say. I know that it's just a burger and that I shouldn't get my panties in a twist but after my less than amazing experience at Shake Shack, I thought that this thing was the best burger I had ever tasted. It isn't, but in that moment it was the burger that fell out of a unicorn's bottom. The patties were juicy, the toppings were generous and I was finally able to get a beautifully cooked burger with plenty of toppings WITHOUT cheese. You'd think I was asking for the moon but it's incredibly difficult to go to a place with a standard menu and ask for a fancily-named-touched-by-the-gods burger with no cheese. The fries were great and I felt greedy for ordering a large as a small would have been more than enough for me. Bottomless soda people... why isn't this a thing in the UK already? Although the burgers are good, for the money, it's not entirely a bad idea to just walk around the corner into Soho and sit down at Honest Burgers or dash a bit further posh side (West) and grab a burger at Patty and Bun. Update: This place has really grown on me. The food is consistently good. The queues however are consistently long. Consider visiting the Argyll Street branch for an easier experience. Shakes are small for the pice but no pricier than other places. Getting a soft drink is still a better bet because bottomless.",

MASSIVE chips (not even joking but the large could feed a family of 4), brilliant juicy burgers and hotdogs that scream America. The decor is a mash of white and red (similar to In-and-Out) with the walls plastered in quotes from magazines they were featured in within the States. Although I am not quite sure the press clippings are 100% necessary, it is a big space and great for families. Great for groups of friends wanting a relaxing atmosphere to sit for a couple hours, slowly devouring the mountain of chips and endless supply of soda.",

For the price I would expect a much better bun that doesn't get so soggy. Also the grilled cheese has lettuce in it, which I do not understand. I've never seen grilled cheese with lettuce it just sounds off. If they are going for American classic they are not doing it right.To me, Five Guys is a familiar spot since there are plenty in my hometown so it's a safe choice for food. Walking in here felt like I was back in the US. This is a good place for a quick bite to eat but honestly there are much better burgers in the area.",

Plain interior designed to look kind of austere I suppose, but the music is way too loud and the staff - the cohort of them - seem to think they are at a dance party not flipping burgers.

    "text": "I finally made my first trip to Five Guys about four months after opening? Why? I hate queues. In my experience, queuing for food is rarely worth it? So would it be worth it at Five Guys?Luckily, when we decided to come (before a nearby show), the queue was relatively short. Only about 10 people outside. Thanks goodness! We grabbed some nuts once we got inside to nibble on while we were in the inside queue.One huge issue I have with Five Guys is the fiddliness. It's just plain fiddly. Too many choices. What do I do with that? I order everything. Well that's not true. I didn't want all the sauces. So I ordered all the veggies. Since I had jalapenos on my burger, I went for mayo and hot sauce as well. We also got cajun fries to go along side. I got a soda and the other half ordered a Brooklyn Lager. I had a raspberry coke zero and dr. pepper zero while I was there. The soda machine is pretty dang cool with all the options. The burgers are pretty good. I mean, there are better burgers in London if you have the time, but for a quick bite to eat, they are pretty good. I was expecting mine to be a bit spicier given the jalapenos and hot sauce. All the toppings does make for a bit of a messy burger, but if you go slow you can avoid some of it. The chips were pretty mediocre. They were undercooked and overseasoned. That was an unfortunate downside to the whole meal.So I say Five Guys burgers are a solid three stars. I'm giving them an extra star for the soda machine and free peanuts. It's a nice touch. I'm not sure how many times I'll be back when I know I can get better food for the same price or cheaper at other locations, but if I need a quick bite, I will probably keep it in mind.",

    "text": "Finally, after months I have finally made it to Five Guys in Covent Garden. For me, this place feels like an average diner, and the constant floor cleaning - in part necessary due to the free peanuts - really annoyed me and made the place remind me more of a McDonald's than anything else. Their system is clever - let people order, and then let them wait after they have ordered. I was there on a Tuesday evening and it was not too busy, so I cannot really complain, at least I did not have to wait outside as is standard at some other popular places.To the food, I must say that I do not understand the hype. They do an average or even a good burger, yes, a little bit thin and dry, but in my opinion, their offering is simply overpriced (and overhyped). The star for me were the skin-on rosemary chips - they could have been more crunchy, but the taste was great. A funny feature, that might be kind of a unique selling point in London are the Coca Cola machines, where you can refill, and mix all kinds of drinks. But that is about it. Not sure how soon I will be back, I know quite a few places where I can get a better burger in a nicer environment for the same price - or less. Oh, and a sign in the toilet that says \"Employees must wash hands.\" is either not funny, or concerning.",

It's location right between Covent Garden and Leicester Square has always put me off a bit, purely on the basis of how crowded the area is after work and pre-theatre. I'm glad hunger called and I stopped in this time to give it a go.I ordered a standard burger with the works. And I mean, THE works. Oh and add a side of fries with that. I wasn't even hungry but I devoured the thing. It was delicious. Without the wrapper I probably wouldn't have guessed it was a chain burger. I wouldn't say gourmet, but not a chain. The meat was textured and had so much flavour, the bread was decent (not fantastic) and not soggy, but the fillings and sauces were the best part. Top it up with stuffings of Cajun skin-on fries, free buckets of peanuts in the shells and free refills of soda and you've got a pretty great, quick and casual dining experience. Forget date nights here but a good place for solo or casual friendly dining. I'll be back!",

    "text": "I like this place, a lot. However, the reason it's not 4 stars but 3, is because, I don't think its burger is all that good, and that's terrible for a burger joint which came over here all the way from the US!If you like gadgety things, this place is great. It has the coke freestyle machine, which is widely available in the US but this machine is the first time I've seen one in the UK. What is a Coke freestyle machine, you cry? Well, it's a machine where you have lots of options to choose from, lots of cola drinks and flavours to choose from, and you can mix and match everything to your heart's desire, from Fanta to diet coke and vanilla coke and Raspberry this...to create either the best or worst drink ever. It's on tap by the way, so we are one step closer to matching the obesity crisis in the US!You get free peanuts while you wait, this is not new, they have them in GBK too but I think they must go through more crates here than in GBK. Their peanuts are nice and fresh, and makes waiting that much less painful.On the topic of waiting, you really shouldn't be waiting in the queue outside. The smart person would download the Five Guys UK app and order at least 10 minutes in advance (paying in advance), then casually stroll past the queue and go to the collection desk and query about your takeaway.OK, the moment of truth is the food. There are bazillion and one choices about your burger. You can add sauces, tomatoes, lettuce etc to your heart's content, or leave them out. The portions are US portions so I would recommend that you practise saying the word \"little\" rather than normal here if you have a small (aka UK) stomach. I gave this review 3 stars because the hype outlived the burger. It came in a foil wrap and by the time my party of 5 got our order, the burger/the bread seems to have shrunk a little under the heat. It was average tasting, but the feeling of eating a shrunk burger spoilt the experience.I cannot fault their cajun fries however, this is the best bit about this place other than the Coke Freestyle machine. The fries are very very addictive, although sometimes they are on the dry side. I have taken to ordering fries here and getting my burger from elsewhere at lunch.One last thing about their PR skills, I can say it was top notch. I actually queued for 1.5 hours here on the day of opening and then because my lunch time was over I had to give up. Their app was jammed by 1pm and you could not pre-order for takeaway using their mobile app. It was frustrating standing in a queue that wasn't moving whilst people who pre-ordered at around 12pm keep walking straight in. I wrote an email to complain and they offered us a free meal, literally a limitless tab, which of course, was a great gesture and a great response to their faulty opening date on 4 July 2013.Ok one last regret about this place, they do not have the secret menu like in the US, I wanted cheese fries! The Five Guys lady in the queue on the first day agreed with me, she also wanted cheese fries! Alas, they do not have it.",

    "text": "I really wanted to try Five Guys last July when I was in London, however the queue was ridiculous and we had a show to catch, so I never got a chance to go. When I booked another trip to London this July, I was making sure that I'd get to try a Five Guys this time around.We headed to the restaurant for around 11:30 for a really early lunch (and to avoid any long queues).I ordered the cheeseburger (with lettuce, grilled onions and 'lite' ketchup), a little Five Guys fries and a drink. My partner also ordered the cheeseburger but got the little cajun fries instead.I was so excited when our order number got called. I opened the silver foil and inside was a burger that looked like the kind of burgers you see people eating on American TV shows; sloppy and oozing with gooey cheese. \u00a0It looked perfect. The taste, however, was not so perfect. The patty was quite bland as were the grilled onions. It wasn't the worst burger I've ever tasted but it certainly wasn't worth the price. We paid just short of \u00a330 for the 2 fast food quality meals. There are much nicer burger joints in London for a similar price (or cheaper) and in future I'll be sticking to those when I visit.The fries were good, I think I preferred the cajun ones to the normal ones.Honestly, my favourite thing about Five Guys was the Freestyle Coke machine. I first tried this when I was in Orlando a couple of years ago and it wasn't something you could get in the UK until FG brought them into their restaurants. There are over 100+ combinations to make the perfect Coke drink for you! I recommend the raspberry coke or the vanilla & cherry coke! Actually, if it wasn't for the Freestyle Coke machine I might have just given this a 2 star review.",

    "text": "Tired of hearing about Five Guys all the time from my friends who just had visited the US I was glad to find one in the UK to finally try this fantastic burger I was promised. Bad start, I was disappointed by the prices. I mean. What ? It's a fast food, and not a high-quality one with premium meats and cheese. I mean, although he burger *tastes* nice, it looks terrible in appearance. They don't even make the tiniest effort on presentation. Also the prices don't even include the fries or a drink. Good grief. The one very good thing is : they're fast at making them, and you get any free topping in your burger from a good variety. And as I said, the burger was good. The fries ? Nah, nothing too interesting over there. There's a lot of them for a meh quality. I'd rather have less with better taste. The place is quite big so I doubt you'll have a hard time finding a seat even when there's big affluence.",

    "text": "If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I'm a big meat eater. So when we had 30 mins to kill before heading to another great Yelp! event at The Covent Garden Hotel, it shouldn't surprise you that we decided to finally give Five Guys a try.To start, there was no queue, which I've heard is a rarity. 6pm is obviously an unpopular time to get burgers, but it worked for us!On initial inspection, the burgers seem quite pricey. But if you take full advantage of the number of complimentary toppings available, it isn't so bad. Laura ordered a standard hamburger with lettuce, tomato and pickle, and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms salad and bbq sauce. We also ordered some fries and refillable drink to share. Total bill was about \u00a320.I really enjoyed my burger. The bacon was crispy and flavoursome and the cheese and bbq sauce were excellent. It wasn't until I finished mine, and then ate the rest of Laura's that I realised how unseasoned and flavourless the patties are. They may be pure beef, and yes, there are two of them between the buns, but still, a bit of salt and pepper wouldn't go a miss.The fries on the other hand would benefit from less salt. Maybe if you put the fries IN your burger then it would be perfect?!So salty fries mean you need a drink and this is where Five Guys wins. There were flavours of pop I'd never even tried. Cherry Fanta was amazing!I'd happily go back again, but it still isn't the best burger in London!",

It all looked a bit messy, but thats how a burger at a fast food joint is allowed to look like :)The taste was amazing and the portion size (especially the fries) was huge.I went there after the movies around midnight and still there was a line up to the door. I walked by the place during the day when there was pretty heavy raining and the line even went around the corner!I hope Five Guys will open some joints in Germany any time soon. There is no way I would ever set a foot again in a McD when there is a Five Guys in an acceptable distance :)",

There was a wow factor about it, a simply \"F*** this is big; F*** this is good\" factor. \u00a0Cajun Fries are skin-on and dusted with what I think is salt and cayenne pepper. \u00a0They are also excellent and plentiful. \u00a0Plentiful as in if you finish your burger, you are probably not going to be able to finishe the fries. \u00a0I left not thinking that I had just spent over \u00a311 on a burger and chips. \u00a0 I left full, happy and wondering who I could bring here that doesn't already know about it. \u00a0In the end, I guess it doesn't get much better than that.",

I ordered a hamburger as just as I like it (i.e. no toppings or sauce etc) along with fries which came to just under \u00a310. The drinks looked pricey (\u00a32.50 for unlimited coke) so I just filled up a water bottle like a cheapskate. Once an order is placed you hang around the counter until they call out your number.I had read some terrible reviews for Five Guys but I'm glad that I kept an open mind as though the food was pretty good. The presentation of the burger could have been better but that didn't really put me off. They even put an extra scoop of fries in the bag leaving me well fed.P.S there is plenty of seating downstairs",

    "text": "I like Five Guys. They do good burgers and the drinks machine is mega cool. So I feel annoyed with myself for having to knock a star off for this particular trip.Here's why: I've been enough times now to know what to expect. I finally broke and got a hotdog this time (I'd tried it before but never had one to myself) and sadly it wasn't properly hot.From the looks of things it had only been cooked on one side which was not how is seen them done before - and oddly it was cooked much faster than I'd previously seen. Usually it takes longer than the burgers to cook, but strangely this time it was much faster.So that killed a point, along with the floor which is always slippery here! It feels like your walking on ice sometimes. But anyway, I think they had an off day, and I'd normally give them a four.",

    "text": "I'm really astonished that five guys has got such great reviews - there is simply nothing that I like about it:The price: I'd assumed the draw was the price, that even if it's sub-quality it's a cheap and fast eat... However with a basic hamburger at \u00a36.75, and a cheeseburger is \u00a38 (just to note this is on par with Meat Liquor, and the Ari Gold burger at Patty and Bun, which is drool worthy and award winning, is \u00a37.50), and a regular fries being \u00a34 (also to note fries are \u00a33 at Meat Liquor, and \u00a32.75 at Patty and Bun), I can't believe that it is! I was simply shocked by the cost! The food quality: The burger was overcooked, and made of cheap quality meat. Soggy bun, and whilst you can choose from a range of toppings for FREE, these are greasy, fatty with the salad feeling limp. The fries were soggy, low quality and too salty... A waste of time and both need to be slathered in sauce, which made me feel unwell. Although sauce is free here... eat all you want!The choice: Wow, free peanuts - really? Is that what it's takes to be different? I see very little on the menu here to make this place special or to stand out apart from these. A choice of free toppings might be an appeal - but I prefer my burger constructed, not just a random mesh of ingrediants slopped together.The restaurant: Full, busy, dirty. You have to queue up for a while to get your burgers and when you finally find a table, it's usually dirty / messy because with the sheer numbers that come though this joint, they can't keep up with the clear up. The place also just feels cheap!Why bother going here when you could go to a nice burger place - and if you want a cheap one - well why don't you go for a cheaper option at a nice burger place!Five times, really, really, really, really, really, not impressed.",

It was fun visiting a Five Guys in London. It's not my favorite burger in the states, and it wasn't my favorite burger in London. But it's solid. I was en route to dinner at Dishoom and I didn't want to ruin my appetite, so I opted for the small size burger (sans bun). Got it across the board with toppings and was in-and-out in about 8 minutes. It was a perfectly fine snack and tasted like all of my previous trips to Five Guys. Continuity when crossing a body of water is tough, but they did it perfectly.",

Like the farore an A list Hollywood star brings with when it arrives at Leicester Sq this was one of the most talked about, Instagramed places I think I'd seen when it first opened.The good thing I found, and I will start with the good is that the drinks machine is like a charlie and chocolate factory treasure trove of drinks. Cherry Vanilla Coke? Yes please. Fun arrives in fizzy form. That is where it excelled.In terms of the food. Well, it's expensive. Very expensive. I thought this was supposed to be an American fast food joint. This isn't at American prices that's for sure. And none with the fries included. For such a high price id expect it for gourmet burgers but it already got me annoyed but I'd braved the queue this far. The burger has loads of free toppings you can get and of course this clever device really adds to the burger because it needs it. It does however make this the most messy burger I've ever had. Falling all over the place, and breaking the bun at that.I mean I wanted to like it. Whether it was hyped or not I expected am Americana burger. I suppose I got it. Not in price, but the down and dirty burger it actually is. However, it's not great and didn't sing the praises of the meat. It hides behind its toppings that come with it. Shakeshack its main rival makes the meat for of a hero in my opinion much more. Overall the burger scene has exploded in London, so I've stayed away from places like this for places like Patty & Bun, Honest or my all time fav, Bleecker St Burger.",

The cayenne fries were ok, but a little bit spicy. What I was most impressed by, was the machine to refill drinks. You can chose Coke, Fanta Sprite and other soft drinks and combine them with fruity flavours like strawberry, orange, raspberry and so on. I have never seen so many combinations of soft drinks, very impressive:). Over all, I would come back, but with lower expectations.",

The service was fine, but the food came out too quickly. All I did was order, leaving my other half upstairs while I went down to get the drink filled and grab a seat. The Freestyle machine crapped out halfway through pouring my cherry Coke, so I had to get the rest of it with just Coke (but it was working when we refilled it). I had barely sat down and my husband came down with the food. Odd, as the hot dogs always take longer than the burgers.The cheese didn't even melt on it properly (normally it's a messy puddle) and the hot dog, while not cold, was not hot. Edible, yes, but without the extra tastiness I had come to expect. I only ate half of it, and a handful of the salt-encrusted fries, before I called it a day.That being said, when we left just gone 6, there was a queue waiting to get in, so I'm clearly in the minority.",

But despite my illness and being appalling company that night (sorry sweety!) I definitely appreciated the food. The peanutty taste in those beautifully soft burgers were divine, and everything else about them (the size, the cheese, those gorgeous bacon pieces which boggled my mind how they were even made) were beyond on-point.They have a drinks machine where you can choose between 100+ soft drinks combinations. This seriously has to be seen to be believed! There were so many things I wanted to try! And had my belly been feeling right I would have. Settled for some tasty Coke & Lime in the end (always was a fave of mine).Grateful to Five Guys for making my boyf a happy man (he is seriously your fanboy). And really appreciated the burger I had there. His recommendation of your burgers being the best was beyond mere fanboyism though, their amazingness is beyond ambiguity~!",

Hot dogs are also available, but I have yet to try them.For vegetarians, there's a choice of grilled cheese sandwiches and fries which come in either \"Five Guys style\" (which are chunky and very fresh as they're made in-store) or Cajun style (same chunky and fresh fries but with a spicy salt added) which are both fried in Peanut oil for extra flavour.They do have a small selection of beers and special flavoured milkshakes, both of which I have yet to try because each Five Guys store has a Coca-Cola Freestyle drinks machine, where you can choose the usual Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite or Fanta, but what makes it special is that you can add flavourings to the drinks, for example you can have Coca-Cola with Lime or Diet Coke with Vanilla, there's over 100 different drinks combinations to choose from.Ideally, it'd make a great date meal, if fact I took my girlfriend to her first Five Guys meal, she was very impressed, it's not too cheap, but it is also not excessively expensive.",

You can get a drink for \u00a32.50 which you can refill for free too.The restaurant has a fun American diner style and we sat downstairs in a really cute little booth.It's pretty good value for money and really tasty.

But since the burger renaissance we've been having in London this doesn't come close to the big hitters. Even though it gets a 3* its burger is no way as good as Meat Liquor which I have also given 3*. Its very quick to get served we waited 20 mins on a Saturday evening. I ordered the double cheese with pickles, onions, mushrooms and ketchup an order of fries and a coke. The burger comes in a traditional sesame bun which just doesn't cut it for me. The fries were soggy and needed binning (which I did) and the coke was too sweet as its from a dispenser. On the whole the burger was tasty and went down well with the minimum of queuing etc so I did return another day just for a burger. It was exactly as before so a good convenient burger bar if you're in that part of town.",
