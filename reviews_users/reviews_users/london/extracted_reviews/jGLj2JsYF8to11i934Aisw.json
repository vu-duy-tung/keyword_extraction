A bight and airy feel to this Victorian building, with a large bar area and plenty of space and tables to enjoy your food. When I visited the barman who it later turned out was the owner was extremely pleasant and helpful from the minute I walked through the door. Situated on the Uxbridge road it is a good walk from Shepherds bush green and is nearly on Askew road or the beginning of Acton. Those looking for a clean and relaxing place to go and chill should seek this one out. As long as it can get people up there, it will fly and be a really good pub / eatery. 2 courses for a tenner or three for \u00a313.50at lunchtime consisting of crab bisque / apple cured herrings/Smoked bacon, black pudding, roasted tomato, poached egg and peppercorn sauce followed by spiced brioche doughnuts- Hope you like fish !!Or choose form the main menu which includes cod, lamb or a rib eye for around \u00a314. \u00a0Various deserts staring at \u00a35. Dinner menu changes all the time, I hope they offer a bit more than the lunch which was a bit limited for me. A simply amazing private dining area upstairs which is fit for a king and a market going on outside on a Saturday bringing you produce from there suppliers, good luck to them in their new venture.",

    "text": "I first stumbled on this place when taking a meandering walk home through Shepherd's Bush. Something about its outward appearance piqued my interest - perhaps its grandiose revamped-Victorian style, perhaps the sandwich board outside with enthusiastic recommendations from the FT and the Independant. I resolved to pop in for dinner some time soon. It took me a while to get around to popping inside, but once I had, I found myself returning soon afterwards. I've eaten here three times now, and each time the food has been pitch-perfect, wonderful feelgood grub without any fussiness. I'm especially keen on their starters and bar snacks - from smoked eel to crispy pig cheek to some wonderful pat\u00e9s and chutneys. And their bangers and mash - pork & chestnut sausages with parsley mash & cassoulet (aka home-made baked beans with lardons) - are the best I have ever tasted. To accompany this, there's a stonking great wine-list - I gather there are more than 350 wines on it, I certainly wouldn't want to count them all (although I'd love the chance to drink my way through them...). The wines aren't cheap - starting at around \u00a315 and going up to the best part of \u00a31000 - but the few which I have tried have been top notch. But this isn't just a trendy wine-bar: pride of place in the huge sweeping bar is give over to four hand-pumps serving some really, REALLY good real ales at sensible prices. (It has to be said that, bar snacks aside, the food costs more than you're likely to pay in most pubs - but in terms of quality you absolutely get what you pay for) The service is very friendly and usually attentive, although my only gripe is that, as the pub fills up, the service becomes a bit slower; but this is a place for sitting back and enjoying yourself at a leisurely pace, and to find fault with the service really would be nit-picking. Interestingly, after going here a couple of times, I mentioned it to somebody who runs a similar (and similarly good) gastropub in Sheffield; he replied that he knew of it, and had made a trip down to London especially to eat there. I can think of no higher recommendation.",

This is the only gastropub (hate the word but can't think of a better!) that really matches the better country pubs in Kent and Sussex for flavorsome food.The wine list is extensive and there are some cracking reds and a very reasonable prosecco that went very well with a starter of oysters. Hearty main courses such as the steak and chips (some of the best chips ever) and delicious fish mains follow surrounded by the constant hubbub of other happy diners. It feels almost like a brasserie but much more English!It's worth booking early for the weekends as the only table available on this particular Friday was at 9.30pm and not in the main dining room.",

The old Victorian pub has been beautifully restored and is split in two large rooms. The first one is set around a large bar with plenty of space and light around, and teh second one is the restaurant area with a very large table in teh middle (we were close to 20 on it) with light coming from the ceiling and a nice deco all around. The food was good, especially main courses but starters were not too inspiring. They have a wide wine selection at reasonable prices. Overall a great pub experience in a fantastic setting, we may be back although we are not quite local but I would like to try this in the summer.",

The sticky toffee pudding was excellent though, with a vertiable lake of rich caramel sauce and crunchy pecans on the side. The service was very friendly - and they answered all my dumb questions about the dessert menu - I'm very particular about my sticky toffee pudding!",

    "text": "The Princess Victoria is one of my top three favourite places to eat. The building is an old Victorian gin palace which has been sympathetically restored to its former glory, retaining as many as possible of the original features. There is a small courtyard at the back, called 'The Herb Garden', with bay trees, rosemary and various other herbs growing there, and antique garden tables and chairs, one of the few places these days where smokers can enjoy a cigarette after their meal. The presentation of the food is simple, no irelevent dribbles of jus, or sprigs of this or that, but every single item on the plate is essential to the flavour of the dishes. Potted Dorset crab was served in an individual white lidded dish with a salad whose dressing complemented it beautifully. Herring roes on toast were the best I have ever eaten, with lemon juice adding to the flavour. The 28-day aged steak was cooked just the way I requested, burnt on the outside and raw in the middle, and the thrice cooked chips were historic. Rissottos were moist and succulent. One of the best desserts I have ever eaten was home made amoretti biscuits with fresh raspberries and peach icecream - and there wasn't a sprig of mint in sight. Service is expert and friendly, spring water (fizzy or still) is free, as is excellent bread and butter. The special lunch menu, with a limited choice but the same standard of cooking, is a bargain at \u00a310.50. After being open for only 6 months the Princess Vic won Time Out's Best Gastropub Award - and thoroughly deserves it.",

The building's large, high-ceilinged, with much of the original detail left, just spruced up. The entry room is more bar-like, with a few tables and a large back room for dining. There are huge skylights and windows which must make it very light and airy in the daytime. I saw Timothy Taylor, London Pride, and some seasonal guest ales, plus lagers, at the bar. The food was great. Simple but delicious. Lots of it, too. I had one of the best ribeye steaks I've had in a while, good chips, a few green beans and grilled tomatoes, and the best bernaise sauce I've ever had. So buttery! That was about \u00a317, so you're paying for what you get. Service was good, very attentive of all the details. Downside? It was very busy, and very loud. In the evening pre-booking a table is probably a good idea.",

My husband's ham hock terrine was also delicious. My main course of pork belly, apple puree, roquefort mash, black pudding and watercress was one of the most delicious plates of food I have had in ages - the flavours all worked together perfectly! The pork belly was melt-in-the-mouth tender! Impressive selection of wines and the very welcome wine by the 25cl and 50cl carafe meant we could have white with our starters and red with the main. We shared a tangy, creamy velvety tangerine creme brulee to finish! Not a cheap meal out but we thought it was good value because of the quality of the food and service.

It's a very cosy pub - the kind of place where you can grab drinks with friends and chill for hours. The bar area is spacious with plenty of seating. The restaurant side is small yet inviting. And they have a back garden area if you choose to take your drinks outside. I spared no expense when getting dinner and drinks here. Had a glass of Malbec to start with the most delicious focaccia bread I've ever had. As always, it's served with a dipping bowl of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Perfect starter. Since my eyes were bigger than my stomach, I ordered a traditional Scotch egg next, which was perfect. The mayo that it is served with has a hint of curry, which adds an interesting flavour to the egg. Then, onto the Sunday roast. I had chicken, which was served with roast potatoes and veggies. I ordered a Yorkshire pudding on the side (because what's a Sunday roast without a Yorkshire pudding?). Absolutely delicious. Perfect English Sunday dinner. Afterwards, we went out to the garden and had a few espresso martinis, which were perfectly made. Truly enjoyed my visit to the Princess Victoria. The staff are very hospitable and attentive.

The food was not an afterthought either. We had aranciata as a starter with an excellent sirloin and gnocchi for the two mains. \u00a0It was topped off with a fluffy cheesecake paired with a Pedro Ximemz dessert wine, This place truly lives up to the term gastropub without living down to any of the snooty connotations. Really friendly staff, really excellent food, and really REALLY good gins. An all around exceptional place. We will certainly come back whenever travels bring us to London again.",

The interior is interesting, with plenty of unusual paintings and bric a brac on the walls. Given it's size you can generally find a seat even on busy days. The bar is well stocked and given its gastro status I watched a barman mix a delicious looking martini cocktail-a first for what is after all a pub. It shows the bar staff are knowledgeable and well trained. This is definitely one of the better pubs on the run up to the Bush. Haven't tried the food yet but will certainly do so.",

    "text": "Like most pubs in the area, the Princess Victoria is more of a restaurant than a pub now with a huge dining room dedicated to eating.That said you can sit round the bar and there are a few bays in the front where you can plonk yourself and have a beer.Service is patchy but the food was decent. My sausage and mash was meaty, creamy and a fair price. And there were plenty of other more ambitious choices on the menu. They are certainly trying for more than pub grub,But the reason to come here really is the beautiful restoration job they've done on the place. It screams old gin palace. It's spacious in a very grand way and it has that feeling of ornateness you always get from Victorian places. They've done a splendid job on the ceiling.Just sitting there watching the world go by is a lovely thing to do and the Princess Victoria definitely puts this otherwise anonymous stretch of the Uxbridge Road firmly on the map.Definitely worth a gander if you're a fan of architecture, interior design or a posh pint before the QPR game.",

Oh, the bread.Some food selections were sublime (thai sausages and the fried mussels!)The steaks were disappointing (two different steaks; two sets of Texan tastebuds)I'm between a 3 and a 4, because the steaks were so very boring and disappointing after the culinary prowess of everything before, but the high points were quite surprisingly high..... we had a nice time overall, so I'll lean 4..... but stay away from the steaks here -- explore the magical alternatives!",

    "text": "About 3 weeks prior to visiting London, I channel-surfed over to CNN where, post-Brexit but pre-Trump, Anthony Bourdain was making his way around London and the English countryside trying to dig deep with people their feelings. Now the focus was on food and eating, visiting with friends and talking and more eating and a lot of drinking, and a heavy dose of banter in between mouthfuls in 5 or 6 different places--putting aside the condescending, high-horse philosophical/political overdubs during commercial outros (let alone his ridiculous, too old for-young-guys-only-tattoos)--it was a good for spotting out of the way London eateries--which was good for me. \u00a0I wanted to get off the beaten path during my week, looking for non-touristy places, were locals go for meat pies and sticky toffee pudding. \u00a0Cut to lunch at pub in the Shepards Bush area named Princess Victoria, everything about it looked appealing. \u00a0So I googled it and book marked it for when I arrived in the U.K. \u00a0I made a reservation for two from their website the day before we ate their, and off we went. \u00a0A huge pub with a beautiful rounded bar and large sit down dining room, we enjoyed the service and the food. \u00a0Loved the Scotch eggs (apparently the joint is know for two things: gin and Scotch eggs...I didn't have any gin but there was 6 pages of different brands). \u00a0The fish and (with massive) chips was just as seen on HD TV. \u00a0Also had mushroom risotto special. \u00a0Beer selection wasn't great and overall slightly overpriced. \u00a0But a friendly, fun Local with a very serious authentic but modern menu of, fresh, locally sourced produce...delicious English pub food. \u00a0Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I think that this place was selected based on some confusion. We were just hungry travelers ( not dressy diners) looking for a pub. \u00a0That said, we found ourselves there on a wine sale Monday and we tried to make the best of it. \u00a0We were only one of three tables dining when we got there, but the way the waitress pushed us, you would have thought \u00a0there was a line out the door and she needed to turn our table,quick. When we did order, she asked us if we wanted the kids' meals with our apps. We said, 'yes' . After a reasonable amount of time, the first courses came. My salad of goats cheese, beets, and walnuts was fine. The 'walnut' in question was a grit sized piece in the dressing. Otherwise, just cheese and beets. My husband got something and ate it. I was too busy watching my sister look for a walnut on my plate, that I missed what it ate. He said it was 'fine'. The kids ate their pasta without complaint, which is something, but not enough to judge a restaurant by. \u00a0One of the kids would eat plain bread for every meal, given the opportunity. \u00a0Speaking of bread, it was really good. Not free, but good (silo in Brighton has the best bread, though)We drank our wine and chatted after the app plates were cleared. Did I mention how difficult it was to wait on us? We were a party of seven who took a few minutes to make up our minds, but the waitress treated us like we were her bunions, so aggrieved was she by our existence. As the night wore on, she got nicer, or the second bottle of wine softened her edges. \u00a0So, we were waiting. For almost an hour for the second course. I guess we were waiting for the braised portion of the lamb dinner (48 E for two) to wholly desiccate. \u00a0the children didn't completely fall apart waiting to watch us eat our dinners, but it was touch and go. When we did get the dinners, they were okay. \u00a0The rack portion of the lamb was really good an medium rare. The steak pie had a crisp, but barely existent crust over an extremely tomatoey center. It was okay. \u00a0Good peas. We had great pie in Scotland, so we had unfortunately high expectations. \u00a0Dessert was okay. The kids liked the ice cream. The strawberry tart wasn't too fruity, which would mean it wasn't fruity enough because it was a fruit tart. . The sticky toffee pudding was gut wrenching, particularly I because the way the waitress pronounced it was so Treacly. Water was free",
