The coffee is great and the staff friendly and approachable. Definitely recommend a visit, if only for the originality. On the way out, there is a whiteboard with pens so you can draw, enter comments etc., also when you get back up the stairs and outside there is also a seating bench around the enclosure to sit and people watch or just have a rest whilst enjoying a great coffee.",

Housed in a former underground, erm, toilet (hence the name), The Attendant has kept much of its original structure (including the urinals! But don't worry, they're well scrubbed up :)) and thus, its character.They're also one of the few cafes in London that serves almond milk, which is great for those of us who are lactose intolerant and might not always want to opt for soy. I went during lunchtime and had a delicious almond milk latte, and a sandwich. My friend went for a cappuccino and a cake, which also looked super appealing.I'd try to visit during off-peak hours, if I were you, so you can stay and enjoy your coffee in the surroundings. The staff there are very friendly as well, which helps.",

So, I'm not much of a coffee connoisseur, but I do know enough to recognise a great cup of coffee and this was certainly that. \u00a0Even without the lure of its quirky history, this spot is a gem.I really liked the little bell you can ring to have your coffee served to you outside- which, could \u00a0be easily missed as its not very visible. A lot smaller than I was expecting, so not ideal for a coffee date, but probably more appropriate for a quick pit stop, or a coffee to go.They also had some yummy looking cakes and cookies, and impressively a gluten free option too. Definitely a fan!",

    "text": "'Attendant' - a name that both refers to the former denizen of this underground space - which was a public toilet for so many years - as well as the present participle of the French verb 'attendre'... Why is that relevant? Well, as soon as it was announced that that someone was finally doing something with this brilliant space outside the Crown & Sceptre pub, this word seemed doubly-appropriate as counting down each day to it's opening - this morning - seemed to last an eternity...It really is a lovely space; not very large but beautifully restored, with some of the seating opposite the bar incorporating the ornate tops of the old urinals (cleaned very throughly, we can only be sure!) for you to settle your flat white and pulled pork sandwich between.The coffee is very good - as it would need to be with Kaffeine a mere 100m down the road! A rotating cast of different beans from the London roasters were being very competently pulled by the young baristas behing the counter when I visited. I've not tried any of their lunch offerings as I popped in for a takeaway coffee only, but if their espresso is any gauge of the quality of the food, then we're all in for a treat.The real star is the space though - descending below street level for your morning fix will likely never lose its novelty value, and I look forward to seeing how the place evolves over the next year. If you're within striking distance and need a quality caffeine-fix (weekdays-only at the moment, by the looks of things), get 'down' here as soon as you can...Fitzrovians have never had it better.",

I got an iced americano, and my friend got a flat white. Maybe it was the fact that it's finally warm enough to get an iced drink, but my coffee was one of the best coffees I've ever had! So yummy. I can't speak for my friend, but her flat white was the cutest thing ever with a perfect milk heart on top. I forgot the name of my sandwich - a long sandwich with beef, - but that too was very good. I was so tempted by all of the pastries, but I was pretty full from the food. The staff were so helpful as well. The woman working there explained most of the food and pastries to me, and let us get comfortable before we made our decisions. The bathroom was really clean as well. Sitting at a urinal to eat/drink was also an interesting experience. I will definitely try to come back before I leave London.",

Sit solo, separated by ornamented ceramic urinal vestibules, or be more social in the re-fashioned booths at the back.Funnily enough, if you do happen to need the bathroom, there is just one functioning lavatory remaining at your service.Oh and the salted caramel brownie is a winner.",

    "text": "Hubby and I have eyed this coffee shop for a while now after reading a lot about it and passing by it on our way home from one of the other many coffee shops in the area. It always looked inviting; I mean, a public toilet turned coffee shop? What's not to ooh and ahh over? =)Finally, a little trip into manic Oxford Street gave us an excuse to stop in for a wee break (ahhh hahaha, see what I did there?). As always, it was wonderful to step away from the chaos of Oxford Street onto a side street leading to the entrance of the shop, which, as you can guess from my intro, looks like one of those old public toilets underground.I had a jasmine tea (loose leaf), hubby and friend had flat whites, and I shared a sea salt caramel brownie. The tea came in a lovely little teapot and accompanying mug, but I thought the water temperature was just a tiny bit too hot and the tea was subsequently a little bitter. Not horrible, though, so I think it was all right. Hubby thought his flat white was just OK, too. The brownie, though, was DELICIOUS. Just gooey and a scrumptious mix of caramel, salt, and, of course, chocolate! Definitely recommend that treat if it's there. The atmosphere and space is great. It's laid back and just cool to see the remnants of the toilets here and there and to see how they incorporated those elements into the interior design. So I'd visit just to have the experience! But the seating is very limited, so I think groups of 2-3 are the most ideal...I really enjoyed visiting, but with other great coffee nearby, I'm not sure if I'll be hurrying back, so though this is probably more in between 3 and 4 stars, I've decided to go with 3.",

How predictable is any joke that may come next!?So, I'd just basically been shoved out of Kaffiene, 50m or so up the road, as the need to shove in more customers seemed more important than keeping those already fed and watered and paid up happy! They can kiss my ... in future. Anyway, my post-double cataract operation eagle eyes spied Attendant in the mid-distance and, never one to follow the conventional route by only visiting the hipster approved joints, I ventured into what is actually a converted public lav. Kaffiene's loss was my gain. Such is the joy of serendipity!Yeah, so that's really cool as I descend the stairs ... literally, it is super-cool down there after the heat of the mean London Summertime streets! First impression: hey have some food, usual stuff, a pretty small counter but lots of perch type seats all around the edges of the room, plus crazy tabletops part made out of the old urinals. Check out the pictures folks have posted (I took some but too lazy just now to process).Service mildly snotty, but warmed up quickly when the guy realised even fat old geezers can be cool and hip if you give them a chance!! Ordered my standard test drink of flat-white and this time had a bit of banana cake. It was mainly moist and suitably banana-ish, so all was fine scoff-wise. The coffee came over. Didn't like the cup, or more the trendy handle, but won't nit-pick. I'd liked (tho' not loved) the Kaffeine coffee, but this was better. Hard to believe I know ... but to my palate there was less sharply acidic edge and it suited me better, so that is good enough. You may prefer it acidic. Up to you. Doesn't make you a bad person.I asked to take a few photo's and the staff warmed up even more and definitely encouraged it. I almost loved them by now such was the all round unpretentiousness and willingness to please any who ventured in. The barista was genuinely a nice person and went out of their way to help. She made a good cup from a very good espresso machine (La Marzocco). One of the nicest flatties I've had down cockney way and possibly ever! The beans are from Caravan, a well known supplier but one of the few I haven't sampled much of in a 'professional capacity', other than at Yorks in Birmingham (much better here at Attendant, tho' may be different beans). Thankfully, it wasn't the ubiquitous (and no doubt excellent to others tastes) Square Mile.",

It would be good if there was a few more options BUT that's only a minor thing. The coffee was some of the best I've had! Very rich.

BUT a kindly stranger volunteered to buy my coffee! My first thought was 'omg no I can't let you do that' but then I thought hey, they wouldn't have offered unless they were comfortable doing it, and it's something I think I'd do myself if the roles were reversed. So thanks kind stranger if you happen to read this! My flat white was really nice, small and strong and hot (these are all characteristics I want in a flat white). I didn't get any food or cakes but there were lots of interesting looking options. Overall this place is cute and quirky and frequented by generous/kind customers!",

The staff is super friendly and the food was delicious. We ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs, and some kind of banana bread served with berries and some delicious homemade whipped cream. All of the food was to die for (look at my picture and see for yourself). We also ordered tea, which came loose leaf in really cool glass pots. It was probably the best tea I had in London. If you are in London you have to come by and see the Attendant, even if you just stop by for a coffee or tea. It will be an awesome experience that you will remember for years.

Bar that nothing special (we came across way better toilet type cafes later in our travels ) .It does have a nice cosy atmosphere , place is clean , a fair selection of food, service is good but the coffee was nothing to rave about and the wrap I had was likewise. Overall if I lived there I wouldn't make it my regular cafe and I would recommend others if they must go , just go( if at all )to see what it's all about. One more footnote...it is good that they have managed to preserve the actual building though instead of it being blocked up or dug up like others I know of. I mean it is kind of history isn't it?.",

I came here to pass on two hours of time in London in-between meetings to crack open my laptop and get on with some work. It did the job for this, however I was propping my laptop up on the tiniest of wooden bench tables. Maybe I just need to get an iPad!Size situation aside - this place is way cool. It's an underground, slightly hidden cafe, where you go downstairs under the road to access. With walls adorned with graffiti and quirky images, it's a laid back, unique little place, ideal for catching up with friends, having a coffee or a light lunch. I went for the roasted vegetable soup and it was delicious - so thick and tasty, packed with all sorts of vegetables. Really warming on a freezing cold rainy day in Jan. It came with slices of buckwheat toast which made it more of a filling meal. I decided to take a break from my usual coffee addiction and get a green tea instead, which came in it's own rather cute teapot. Friendly staff, a nice atmosphere and the best R&B mix on in the background! Personal preference I guess :) They offer so many tempting homemade cakes and sweet treats, plus a couple of other lunch options like avocado on rye toast, superfood salads and mainly healthy options. A nice spot to visit in London when you don't want to go to a chain place...",

    "text": "Yesterday I ate french toast in a toilet. Well, a converted public toilets under Foley Street in Central London called The Attendant. Me and four friends had made plans to meet for lunch somewhere central, and we were struggling to whittle down the thousands of London establishments to just one. This seemed like the best option as it was something different, located centrally and didn't seem too formal for what was a quick catch-up.Seating OptionsA friend and I turned up around 12.30pm, and the first thing that struck me was the exceedingly small number of seating options available. After all, this is a converted toilet! Thankfully, round the corner to the right there's a couple of tables with bench seating, so we managed to get an area for the five of us. It's not possible to book ahead as far as I know, so I would recommend only going here if there's just two of you to avoid disappointment.The FoodFrench toast was about \u00a38 each, and sandwiches ranged Chorizo & Bacon, Royale Chicken to Mushroom and Halloumi. By 12.30pm they had ran out of the other brunch specials. They also had a selection of pastries and cakes on offer at the counter too.The AtmosphereThe staff are SO nice! As well as that, their soundtrack was top notch and the lighting was just perfect for an underground venue. I particularly liked the fact that so much light filters through from the main entrance, making it feel that little bit bigger. It was a bit cramped, and the couple next to us kept having to hunch over their table so people could get to the toilet. As such, this is not the place for a two-hour long natter. It has an in-n-out vibe, you wouldn't expect to be here for more than 45 minutes especially as the food is served pretty quickly.This is by no means the first converted toilet in London (Cellar Door and Ginglik are just two that spring to mind), but the space is beautiful, light and if I worked that little bit closer to this place, I would definitely pop in here for a pre-work caffeine fix.",

They have a \u00a35 minimum if you're using a card so I got a flat white and gluten free lemon polenta cake (a recent obsession of mine). The presentation was beautiful with coffee art and they actually had to cut the cake! Not pre-sliced. The coffee was delicious and the cake was hands down THE BEST ever. The edges seemed hard and over cooked at first, but when I took a bite it was densely saturated and almost caramelized lemony deliciousness. When the barista brought my coffee he also brought me a glass of water. Now that's service. The stools are not the most comfortable unfortunately, and unless you grab a table you're stuck staring at a wall. But there is some art to look at. The music was great, the perfect level for conversation but just a little too loud for reading. All in all I will definitely be coming back.",

This place surpassed my expectation as I have stepped out of the social norm of avocado toast and instead experimented with their Chili Pea smashed toast. Now let me just say WOW!!

Must be honest, this notion of a cafe joint underground and in the old Foley Street men's bathroom is so flipping cool, I just had to check it out. The space is amazing, a bit cramped, super hot and humid, but what could be expected from an old restroom? I adore how they have a cast iron entrance at the surface, which leads to the stairwell down to the venue. The old tile as well as urinals along the walls are odd yet very interesting touches, and I really enjoy what they've done with the space. The service was.... disappointing. They are not very friendly, perhaps they were distracted or having a bad day, but in such a cool place, I would have expected a little more energy and warmth. I felt an uncomfortable, almost, \"drink your cappuccino and eat your cold seed porridge and get out,\" sort of vibe.I had to try the \"cold porridge\" for interest's sake, and it was not my thing. The fresh fig garnish was delicious! But everything beneath it felt like mushy and gelatinous crushed seashells in my mouth. I'm honestly not sure what was inside it, I think huge chia seeds along with some other white crunchy seeds that didn't feel palatable. This was also \u00a36-odd pounds! \u00a0Perhaps I chose wrong, and should have stuck with the other pastries, sandwiches, or salads laid out, that did look really delicious and appetizing.",

I haven't sat down inside as I have seen others do, but the coffee is incredible. If you're in the area, it is worth having a look even if you're not into coffee.",

They have nice music, the food looks tasty, and they have a nice selection of drinks! If you're looking for lunch, this might not be the place to go, since their portions are small. However, it is the perfect place for sitting down and chatting with friends. The seats are not very comfortable, which is why I'm giving it 3 out of 5. So if you have a bad back, it's not the best place to sit for a long time.Overall, I really enjoyed my time here! Highly recommend to anyone who is a die hard fan of quirky coffee shops!",

But if the novelty of the space isn't enough for you it's still worth a visit for the decadent food and beverages served up on quaint vintage tin plates.Delicious coffee, food for the soul and it's made full use of the small architecturally sound space it occupies (and I love a barista who can make a soya latte to the right temperature without burning the milk). Try the crayfish on brioche sandwich - I did and it was mouth melting deliciousness - but I'll be going back for the smashed avocado on sourdough!",

    "text": "Great Little Brunch Spot in Fitzrovia Former Victorian toilet, what a charming place. They have left the sinks and toilet flushes up on the wall, love it. Friendly staff and for being a Sunday brunch peak-time we were surprised to get a table.Short but sweet menu of brunch dishes. The menu changes regularly, so I'd love to come back for lunch & coffee one day - it's just a stone throw away from my office. I tried the Middle Eastern, with home-made baked falafel, honey miso roasted aubergine and jerusalem artichoke. I added portabello mushrooms.For not having a proper kitchen (all food prepared at the coffee counter), I was so impressed by how complex this dish looked. Even little edible flowers.Delicate Middle Eastern flavours. Loved the home-made falafel. My friend had the Corn Fritter Stack, with poached eggs, avocado, tomato and bacon. Very comforting brunch dish.",

Life is a joyous thang!Anyhoo its small and warm downstairs and the staff are friendly and polite! I went for the smashed avocado on sourdough bread with poached eggs,betroot humus and smoked salmon. YUMMMMMMY!!!!!!!! Seriously delicious!I tucked into that plate as if my life depended on it! surprised they didn't throw me out for public indecency haha As I'm a foodie I couldn't let this trip go to waste and so my sister and I ordered a portion of their winter berry banana toast with cream and syrup! .......MONEY MAKERRRRRR!!! this was to die for!! Even though we didn't even finish our first course we hammered into this baby in a way MC hammer would be proud of! Crazy reference but bare with me! Overall loved it! Defo Defo going back! Only downside for me was that the stools didn't have a backrest and so after all that hammering into the food I needed support! Mentally and physically! Could've done with a back rest but apart from that yes I had a lovely brunch worth calling my great aunt zelda about! ....... OK so I don't have a great aunt Zelda but you get the drift",

They have kept some of its old characteristics and the board says: the urinals have been cleaned properly, lol! I came here for my daily dose if poached eggs with avocado on toast and let the picture speak for itself! The only downside I would say is that for group dinners you wouldn't be able to come here as it is simply too small. Next time I am coming here I will try some of their sweet breakfast options as what my neighbour is having, a maple cyrup toast thing, looks absolutely mouth watering, I will be back!",

If you can't come to terms with the idea of drinking your coffee snugly positioned within an old urinal, make sure you get one of the tables because it's still worth coming here. Urinals aside, the old tiled walls decked out with the new funky decor makes for a place you definitely want to hang around in. I ordered the smashed avocado and added the poached eggs for a few extra \u00a3. Really simple, well executed food that you can't complain about. Add to that a coffee that was one of the best I've had in London- and coming in around \u00a310 it's a great way to start your day. Not only have I never spent so long in a public bathroom, it's the first one i'm looking forward to hitting up again the next time I'm in the area.",
