    "text": "So I went here a couple of weeks ago for a friends birthday party. Inside it is really dimly lit. I remember looking through the menu and desperately trying to find something that I would like to eat. In the end I finally settled on two starters - garlic bread and nachos. The garlic bread was served vaguely lukewarm - it was pretty much cold when it arrived. The nachos also came served cold and were soggy. Both of these dishes were supposed to be served warm. I ate all the garlic bread but I could only stomach a few nachos - I just couldn't finish them they were so horrible. I mistakenly though dessert would be better. I ordered churros which were quite stodgy and some of them were a bit burnt around the sides. They tasted overcooked, old like they'd just been reheated. The chocolate 'sauce' was way too thick it was basically cold chocolate spread. For the amount of food you get on a plate and the quality of said food - it is ridiculously over priced. I know this is in Leicester square but I still think for what you get the food is waaaaayyyy too over priced. The only good thing was that the all the staff were darlings - they were really nice and friendly. Will never come back here again - the food was terrible and much too expensive.",

    "text": "Chiquito is one of the most visible establishments catering to the horde of tourists and locals that throng Leicester Square. It serves a combination of mexican and creole food.The place is usually very crowded. It is not unusual for people to have to wait for an hour or so during dinner time. This is usually a big turn-off for me ... and so i don't usually go there unless i am really craving to go someplace new.The food menu, as well as the cocktail list, is extensive ... though not very original. But that's not something i would expect in a place like this. The cocktails and wines are decent. The last time we visited we ordered a dish of meatballs and a plate of cheese nachos for starters. The meatballs were very much like the ones you get at Subway, except for some extra cheese. The nachos were delicious. However after we had ordered, they got us a complimentary plate of nachos. We would have ordered less had we known about this.Though the starters were good, the main courses were not upto the mark. I got the aztec jambalaya. It had all the requisite vegetables and meats that should go into the dish, but it just wasn't tasty. The dish was quite dry, and hence wasn't very enjoyable. My friend ordered the vegetable version and his was equally unpalatable. Another one of us ordered the \"fiery chicken\". This dish was probably better ... just that it was so hot that one could hardly get any other taste.All this cost us ~\u00a323 per person. The food didn't deserve that much, even if you take into account the location premium. I guess i will go back to not making the effort to eating here.",

The decor is really tacky, there's Latino music constantly playing at a low level which can be a little off putting. As for the food, the nachos are a good option for a starter, the portions are really huge and great for sharing. Last time i went i opted for vegetable chimichanga, it wasn't that great but I'm assured the enchiladas are nice. Main courses cost around \u00a310, ok considering your in the heart of London's tourist centre, but standard isn't great. Drinks are very pricey; house wine is as much as \u00a35 a glass. Ok if you're stuck for somewhere to eat, but i wouldn't rush back here.",

    "text": "Those who have been to Mexico and are craving an authentic Mexican experience will probably hate Chiquitos. It is definitely more a Mexican theme restaurant than a serious culinary contender. However, having never been to Mexico and having no prior expectations (other than oh man, it's on Leicester Square, it's going to be overpriced and awful) I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is huge and well-staffed. They are clearly used to dealing with large groups, and handled our group of eleven with ease. We were rapidly seated and served drinks - they do a range of beer and wine and excellent value cocktails. To be honest the evening was bound to go well once one of my friends and I started on pitchers of Long Island Iced Tea, but even this was nicely made (and deceptively strong). The menu's got a variety of mexican and Tex-Mex favourites on it, from burritos to chimichangas, sizzling fajitas and quesadillas. Also burgers, ribs and all that sort of thing. All the food looked great- in a chain restaurant kind of way, and the sizzling steak fajita that I had was both large and tasty. Could have been more cheese, but when you've got a sizzling pan of meat and onions in front of you, Man Mode takes over and nothing else seems important. This is a great place to go with a group. It's not hugely expensive - there's something for everyone and, above all, it's fun. Don't go expecting a culinary revelation, but go with a group, have jugs of cocktails, chow down on some hot, tasty mexican-ish food and it's very hard not to enjoy yourself.",

I used to get the chicken enchiladas always followed with a frozen strawberry margarita. They were big and yummy and the type that doesn't taste like it has alcohol in it but after two you notice you're seeing double and starting to lose your balance (FYI this translates into THEY'RE AWESOME). Yes, the decor is tacky. Yes, it's not authentic Mexican food. Yes, it's in Leicester Square. But - if you're an American expat surviving on dorm food or late night trips to Sainsbury, Chiquitos goes down pretty good.",

BUT yet again just one more restaurant to add to the list of not good mexican food. I didn't have the highest expectations (bad mexican food experiences in london and it being located on Lleicester square) and sadly the food was rather bad. We ordered nachos to start off and were served a big plate of nachos, but with only a small scoop of guacamole and co (not nearly enough for all the nachos). Second I got the chimichangas and those I must say were pretty bad. Despite the fact that they are fried the chimichangas were super dry! I ordered the ones with fajita veggies inside and sadly I mainly had red onions and undercooked aubergine. I would not recommend this place. If you're dying for mexican food you're better of going to tortilla, chilango, and chipolte.",

The service \u00a0if anything was too fast when I was there. \u00a0He asked if I was finished when I was putting a chip in my mouth and was picking up my plate before I could answer and that just ruined it for me. The others had finished but I was late and needed more time. \u00a0Clearly the plate was half full. So Im thinking its like one of them places ; not too fancy get the customers in then out quickly. Im assuming its not an expensive place from the vibe Im getting and I just got what my friends were having so didnt check the price. \u00a315.25. For that it wasnt a good meal because the ribs were nice but the sauce was too much and from a bottle and it was sloppy. If I paid \u00a0maybe \u00a310.00 or less it would have been easier to digest .",

    "text": "I wanted Mexican food badly enough to ignore my first impressions of Chiquito's and that was a huge mistake. Its not that the restaurant in Leicester Square looks that bad, its just that its haphazard seating system and cattlecar density in the dining room didn't bode well for the rest of the dining experience. Eating dinner with a friend, our drink orders took 35 minutes to get to the table. Once they did arrive, mine was wrong and took another 20 minutes to get back to me. It would have taken longer, I assume, but as our food was coming out, around the 50 minute mark, our waiter noticed my lack of an ordered drink and retrieved it from the bar. The food itself isn't that bad, but definitely isn't worth the wait. I had the chili tacos, which don't really qualify as traditional Mexican food, but did help to satiate my longing for such. The fajitas also appeared to be pretty tasty, as well as some of the appetizers. My only complaint with the food was the serving size, as my tacos came with only a scant amount of cheese and nothing that would pass as edible lettuce. Overall, Chiquitos isn't the worst place I've ever eaten in my life, by a longshot. However, the chances of me ever braving their indifferent and haphazard service for their average to below food is slim.",

    "text": "Well I have to admit I love Mexico and Mexican food so this is a restaurant the I have visited many times with my partner and with various family members including children, and some older members who dont really do 'spicy food'. The MenuThis is split into the usual starters, mains and side orders on one side, and desserts and drinks on the other side of a big piece of card. The starters range from the particularly non spicy prawn cocktail, to an extra large platter of things like potato skins, chicken wings, jalapeno poppers and more, that we shared between 3 of us today and had plenty to eat. I usually have the jalapeno poppers filled with cream cheese, these come served with a jelly that is just so scrumptious.There is a large selection of main courses, of which I have tried many. The ones which come to mind as my favorites are the maple glazed salmon, two of my favorites, maple and salmon put together, you cant go wrong. It comes with rice, but not being keen on rice, got this swapped for fries, with no problems. My other favorite is the Acapulco chicken, very moreish. Hubbies favorite seems to be the chicken and ribs combo, which comes smothered in barbecue sauce. Now he is very picky about his barbecue sauce, but says that they have got this just right, not to spicy and not too sweet but sticky enough to coat the meat. Oh and we both like the burgers there as well, you can add or leave of toppings to get just what you want. There is a childrens menu, which is disapointingly not mexican based, but hey with kids you need to offer some things that they will recognise and eat. When we have taken kids there, we were offered a smaller portion of what was on the main menu if that was what they wanted.We have also taken some 'older' family members who definately dont like their food 'messed about', their words not mine, and even they have been happy and found something that they like within the menu. Desserts - my favorite part of the menu, well as usual there is cheesecake (my fave) comes with sumer berries, and ice cream. Today we had between us, a banana taquito (hubby) which is a banana wrapped in a cinamon tortilla, deep fried and served with ice cream and fudge sauce, judging by the way the plate emptied then it was a hit, I had the deep fried ice cream, which unfortunately is the only thing I have ever had that I didnt really like. There was nothing wrong with it, and it was served nicely, but just didnt appeal to my tastebuds, it is wrapped in cinamon flavoured crushed cornflakes and deep fried. It was okay, but not great, and I think a dessert should be great. If you are going to indulge in all those calories then it has to be worth it, and this just didnt make the mark with me.Service This was excellent, we went today, in the middle of a sunday afternoon and although the place was busy, we did not have to wait for a table, our menus were brought to us immediately and we had to ask for more time to peruse the menu when they cam to take our order. Our drinks arrived quickly, and when they were getting near empty our free refills arrived at our table without us having to ask for them.The food arrived promptly and was piping hot. I can honestly say that we have never had bad service at this restaurant. There were lots of staff on hand this afternoon to keep the place running smoothly and clean. PriceReasonable, we could have eaten cheaper at a pub or somewhere, but we like it here and it is not outrageously expensive. We spent \u00a355 for a three course meal for 3 people including drinks, so I feel that is good value for money. Other stuffThis restaurant has been refitted since we last went and they have removed the circular booths which was my favorite place to sit so that is a bit of a disapointment, but has no bearing on the food or service. The toilets, very clean, plenty of soap, hot water and tissue, the ladies anyway, I didnt feel the need to check out the gents. If slightly confusing for my mother in law as the signs on the doors are in spanish, so we told her to make sure she looked at the pictures on the doors to make sure she didnt end up in the gents.Overall, we like this restaurant, and the type of food they serve so it will remain one of our favorites. Obviously the menu has a mexican slant, but you can find things on there if there are members of your party that are a little less adventurous in their tastes, and they should be happy. A good family restaurant.",

I gave two stars out of pity. Saying that I want to say that next time I go to a fake Mexican restaurant in London I will be sure to translate the name first. Chiquito translates to tiny and that is the only way to describe their portion sizes. Not only is this restaurant stingy, overpriced and has terrible service but, they didn't even give us chips and salsa to start, instead they gave 11 pieces of cold salty popcorn (no refills). We ordered chips and salsa for an additional cost. Not only were the chips stale but the salsa tasted like marinara sauce and the sour cream tasted and looked like whip cream. The salads we ordered were extremely overpriced, they weren't even salads either, they were basically skewers with a few pieces of lettuce under them. They made it clear that everyone who works here has never been to Mexico or even the Southwestern United States for that matter.",

It's American food with peppers, basically, and no where near what I was looking for.Regardless, I gave this place a shot. The service, as many have mentioned, was pretty poor. Even for being in touristy Leicester Square. I can see past service, service is easy to improve, even when it is bad. However, the food just wasn't to par, even for Tex-Mex. Maybe this is my fault for coming to a chain restaurant. I did like their nachos, but even those I've had better. The one redeeming quality of this place is that they have both Dos Equis Amber and Pacifico. If I am in the area and craving one of those and nachos, I will come back, but it is unlikely. Especially with Wahaca not for down the road. Hell, even Texas Embassy had better Tex-Mex.",

So if you haven't good good salsa and you haven't got good tortillas, you haven't got good Mexican food.You don't have to look any further than the chips and salsa at Chiquito to know you're not in for an authentic or particularly tasty Mexican meal. Good salsa is either chunky (e.g. pico de gallo) or smooth (generally spicier types). The salsa here is like the chunky salsa you get out of a jar in the supermarket, but probably not as spicy. Besides that, the chips taste stale.As if that weren't enough, the menu lists paella as a \"Mexican Favourite.\" Last time I checked, they don't eat a whole lot of Spanish food in Mexico.I ordered a burrito on my first visit here. It was supposed to be spicy chicken, but it was just bland. And for over 11 quid, it was an awfully small portion.On my most recent visit, I just came in for a quick snack. I ordered a flauta (which is actually a taquito, they just don't know the slightest thing about what real Mexican food is), which came out ridiculously burnt on the ends and literally didn't taste like anything.The only redeeming quality about this place is a nice atmosphere. It's a large, nicely decorated space good for socializing.These guys are in trouble if Taco Bell runs a test market in London...",

If you're from America and desperate for Mexican do a bit more research, lacking that give it a try. Just don't expect much.

Out waitress came over right away and was incredibly attentive and friendly. We opted for the strawberry mojitos. They came right away. They were incredibly sweet, tasted like strawberry syrup. Not my cup of tea but I'll chalk it up to a difference in taste.For dinner we got the 15 quid deal for a starter and a main. Got the quesadilla bites as the started and the burrito as a meal. For better or worse the meal came out in approximately 2 minutes. We asked for both at the same time and both arrived together. The runner and the server were both amazing. The quesadilla bites were quite delicious. They seemed to be in some type of sauce so it was really something that had to be eaten with a fork and knife rather than finger food that could be picked up and eaten with your hands. Both were satisfying enough, but obviously more of a quick meal chain restaurant feel to it. The burrito came with tortilla chips (crisps), guacamole, sauce and sour cream. The one complaint is that the guacamole tasted bad. It was clear that it had chunks of avocado in it but it tasted really off... Like rancid. Not sure if the avocado went bad but even if that was the case it shouldn't taste like that. Overall we came in at 7:08 and had our bill paid by 7:33 so as far as a quick meal goes it wasn't that bad and not that expensive for two people. A+++ for the servers",

They also had a live band and dancers which was a great touch.A real difference from the last time i went, so i will def be back to see if its the same on a non launch night",

I was hungry and started eating and by the time he checked back I was almost done and we needed to be somewhere so I just ate it. The chicken enchiladas that my wife had were pretty good for British Mexican food.The ambiance of the restaurant when we arrived was nice on the patio. there was music coming from one of the street performers - which was quite good. And then all of a sudden they turned on the Mexican Mood Music - loud Mexican Pop music (way too loud). When Sam came by (finally) to check on us we complained about how loud it was and he just said that that was they way\"THEY\" play it.Like Henrik A. says - they clearly are a tourist place and don't expect you back anyway.Anyway, I am from the US and don't plan another trip to London - but IF I did, Chiquito's would not be on my itinerary.",

    "text": "We were looking to waste some time before going to the theatre, and being lovers of Mexican food, we decided to give Chiquito a chance.Entering the restaurant, you are greeted by very friendly staff who swiftly guide you to your seat. If you are looking for a quick bite, this is definitely the place to go. Our food arrived within around 10 minutes. The portions are reasonable but unfortunately the food is incredibly bland. If you are a fan of Mexican food, you'll be a bit disappointed here. My pulled pork wrap had absolutely no spice in it and didn't really taste of much at all.",

    "text": "Service : We booked a table in advance for Saturday at 8pm and with my experience with booking, the table is always ready to sit the crowd, person or couple. My family members were already at the restaurant and I was meant to get there a little later. I arrived at 8:10pm and they are waiting outside in the cold for the table they booked! As I'm the brave one, they sent me along with the tag to enquire about it. The lady told me that our table would be cleaned, 5 more minutes. We waited another 10 minutes until I spotted the manager and had a word with him.. He said another 5 minutes and my response was \"that's what she said 5 mins ago\". Anyway he promised that it would be done in 2 mins and luckily for them, it was. We were walked up to the table and served by a lovely blonde girl who was attentive the whole night. Nice, friendly, confirms order and whether we were still waiting. Of course, everyone got their starter and I waited another 5 minutes to her mine... 5 minutes and waiting seems to be the trend here. Complementary: Popcorn. STALE, COLD, NASTY! Drinks : Ok, I can't understand how a Mexican restaurant is bad at making cocktails especially margaritas. Maybe I've been spoilt in having really good ones and find theirs watered down and lacking the alcohol I paid for.. The strawberry daiquiri tasted like banana and strawberry smoothie. Food (Starters)I had the peri peri prawn as starters which was tasty and I also tried the other starters from family members. The BBQ chicken winds were tasty, the mushroom was good and so was the quesadilla. Food (main) : I had the San Pauli sea bass with Mexican rice and vegetables. It was a good dish but I wonder how long my rice and veggies had been sitting on the counter for before my hot sea bass on served on that plate... Cold rice and veggies.. No no no! Other members ordered baby back ribs, chicken and pulled pork dish served sizzling, steak served sizzling and chicken skewers which seemed to go down well. Their food is good and typical Mexican but elements of it really put me off like cold rice. Overall: The price is moderate for London but the service makes it expensive for that price.. If it wasn't for the waitress I wouldn't give much stars. Nevertheless, their food is tasty, it's extremely busy all the time and don't go to the central London branches. This joint may be good for crowds but it's not a place I would visit out of my own choice ... I think they are overpriced and don't stick to the principles of advance bookings ..",

    "text": "Pretty standard of this chain Mexican restaurant. \u00a0Although I have to say their service has improved since the last time I was there. \u00a0I went here on a Saturday night and we were seated before the main rush, which was good as I know previously when there have been most the seats filled in the place, it can take some time for food and drinks to arrive and I think they have the knack of not employing enough waiter staff for the amount of covers they have. \u00a0The dinner that my friend and I chose was of a perfectly acceptable standard and decent enough for pre-theatre food. \u00a0It is never going to be a wow place and I would imagine a lot of their trade is passing tourists as opposed to die heard regulars. \u00a0If you want a standard dinner with standard service then it is fine. \u00a0Nothing negative really about my recent visit, nor anything particularly woohoo, but it did the job.",

    "text": "Love love love Chiquitos!! I came here for the second time at the weekend and was equally as impressed as the first time around (even though I ordered exactly the same things!). We got nachos to start - when we ordered we said we were sharing them so when they arrived we were surprised by the large portion, but when we got the bill we realized they had given us \"sharing nachos\" for about double the price even though we only wanted the small lot. Anyway, doesn't matter because they were lush! For mains I got BBQ chicken fajitas which are incredible. The meat, peppers & onions are brought to you on a hot plate, sizlling away. You are then brought wraps and a tray of the sauces and cheese etc. The BEST bit for me is that you can order more of the wraps and sides for free! The chicken is also ridiculously tasty. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and chorizo tacos which he said were delicious and he would definitely recommend them (I was too full from my 6 wraps to try his!)If you are a student, apply for their student card as it gets you 25% off food which is such a help! The staff are really helpful. Unfortunately our food was quite slow arriving this time but they were super busy and the ambience inside of Mexican music and sombreros means that you want to stay in there anyway!",

We actually wanted to order food, but were informed that if we wanted to sit outside, we could not get food as they were bringing the tables in soon. An hour later..and the tables were still outside..whatever. They saved us from ourselves I reckon. We had a couple cocktails, not so cheap, and of medium quality. I'd go again for a spot to sit and people watch!",
