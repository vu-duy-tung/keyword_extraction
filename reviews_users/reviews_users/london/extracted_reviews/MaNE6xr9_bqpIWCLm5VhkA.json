They now hold a food bar at Fountain Court.I love it. It is alfresco dining with table-bench seating. The pies are full of sculenct meats and gravy. The mash it self is homemade with all the taste. They also offer homemade apple and ruburb pies, with custard or ice cream.Its all good food in a busy town, certainly gets you ready for your shopping day or sight-seeing. Try it.",

Goddard's was the perfect place to start.The staff were upbeat and friendly, quick to serve and always with a smile. The shop itself is quite small with pew bench seating, though there is a larger seating area upstairs. The decor is classic; late Victorian tiles and vintage signs. The food is delicious for what it is - pie and mash isn't exactly high dining. The delight is in its simplicity. I had the steak and ale with mash and gravy, though there are a large range of pies available (chicken and ham, classic minced beef etc), as well as a large variety of serving options - double pie, double mash etc. I sampled the liquor but decided against it - I think I need to ease myself into the pie and mash game slowly. If you're still feeling peckish after your savoury pie Goddards have a variety of dessert pies - cherry pie, apple pie and that great British classic, crumble. All available with ice cream or, of course, custard.The shop also do a takeaway service, as well as a range of cold and hot drinks.",

The pie was tasty, but the mash and mushy peas were a bit bland and could definitely be improved. I ordered double mash because I thought that meant 2 scoops of mash, but it turned out to be 4 scoops!

The place was a little grubby - tables, condiments on the table and chairs felt sticky - but Mr L told me that this was kinda expected. I looked at him dumbfounded, not sure if he was pulling my leg. He was serious. So I decided to ignore that and quickly tuck into my pie and mash, hoping that the food will make up for it. I chose the steak and kidney pie with mash (\u00a34.40), laden with gravy. The kidney taste was strongly present but the filling only consisted of steak and gravy which I find was quite salty. The mashed potatoes and gravy had quite a floury taste and I am not sure what to make of it. Pastry, was a little burnt. Lunch was ok but was very ordinary.Goddard's has a reputation of serving up traditional pie and mash for over 100 years. The setting - nothing deluxe or lavish - also had that traditionalist aspect. It gave quite a nice welcome feeling as you walked in but when you are by the bar to order, make sure you already know what you want. \u00a0Both the queue and service moves quite fast and while the service was not abrupt, it was not particularly friendly. \"Full range\" on the menu means pies with mash where prices start from \u00a33.90. Goddard's pies are quite a simple and regular lunch. I do suspect the big play on being traditional helps with their trade among the tourists in Greenwich.",

I bring all of my foreign guests here for a taste of traditional British pie and they all leave full and satisfied. If you're familiar with traditional brown British gravy, I suggest trying their (non-alcoholic) herb-infused liquor sauce on your pie and mash. The mushy peas were not so mushy the last time I came but I'm glad I gave them another go as they were much better this time around. So happy I saved a little room for dessert as their rhubarb crumble with custard was out if this world!!! The next time I need a fix of pie, you know where to find me!",

Found Goddards after we had walked through Greenwich Park to the Observatory and were ready for a bite to eat after all that walking. Out of all the pubs and pie shops we ate at in London, this was by far and away the best. Inexpensive, hot and fast, helpful people behind the counter who didn't hate us for being American, and just an all around great time. The pies were crispy and flaky, the mash was perfect, and don't let anyone tell you that British food doesn't have flavor! This place blew that stereotype out of the water! My American friends looking for good pie and mash in London, look no further!",

We knew what we wanted - pie and mash obviously! We were pleasantly surprised that it was only an extra 90p to add some mushy peas, so that was great! My boyfriend ordered us a steak and ale pie each, with mash and mushy peas each. I had a cup of tea (\u00a31) and he had a bottle of Budweiser (\u00a32.70). After he'd ordered it at the food bar, the lady behind the counter served it straight away, and there is sometimes nothing better than immediate and quick food!No waiting and low prices made the visit very successful, relaxing and enjoyable! We did try 1 jellied eel each for 50p, but they weren't for us ;-) The fish meat itself was okay, but the jelly around it was a bit strange. The pie, mash and mushy peas were so so great though, and the prices make it just sooo much better! You end up spending way way way under \u00a310 per person, and I had about 2 cups of tea! Ooh, and I nearly forgot, we had the blackcurrant and apple crumble with custard for dessert, MMM! It was so delicious, especially with the side of ice cream I ordered, as well as the custard! It was a great visit and highly highly recommend it to anyone who loves pies and mash!!! x",

Never assume. I ate at this place over the weekend. And let me tell you, they know good pie and mash (I can't vouch for the jellied eels but my parents enjoyed them). I only moved back to the UK a year ago after living abroad for a few years and I was always craving good old British pies so this place was like heaven to me. So many flavours of pies, and it will definitely not break the bank either! We had the steak and ale, cheese, and chicken and ham pies with mash and mushy peas. The pastry on all of them was fantastic with great mash and great gravy. The mushy peas weren't as mushy as I'd like...Too picky? Meh, maybe but will go without next time. I have to say I was also a little disappointed with the flavour of the chicken and ham; it was a bit bland but there were huge chunks of chicken in it. The flavour of the steak and ale was delicious. But my favourite? The classic cheese pie. There's nothing better than drowning a cheese pie in gravy (I'm Northern, we LOVE gravy). I will 100% be coming back here to try out more flavours of this British classic.",

I kill for eels.If this is a Hitchcock thriller and a mysterious stranger needs me to do a dastardly deed - have him give me eels and I might be good for the business.That said - even with the soft spot in my heart for eels - these are very good eels indeed.(and I have been many places like some first rate eel restaurants in New York's \u00a0Chinatown - where - never mind the reputation - the eels were only ho-hum.) These eels really sing.They have a great fishy taste that stays with you in a nice way even after you have left the restaurant.The eels are served in \"liquor\" the special green sauce they put on pies and mash and peas and everything else.The combo is killer.One practical note. Here eels are a side dish - usually served along side pies and mash.(and in my humble American what-the-h-do-i-know manner ... i honestly don't see how eels go with a savory beef or kidney pie. Its like serving beef bourguinon with carp. - but its what they do.)since they serve it as a side dish - eel servings are small. If they are going to be your main (and I recommend this) - order a double or triple order.People at Goddards routinely order double or triple pies or double or triple mash - so no one will blink an eye at double or triple eel.Now what about the pies?Fantastic!The key feature of a pie is the crust.They do a suet crust that is knock your socks off addictive.They could a beef and building construction waste pie in that crust and you would eat it happily.The sauces are a deep beef gravy and the aforementioned \"liquor\".You can't go wrong either way.I sadly was not able to do dessert but I stared longingly longingly at the lovely crumbles and pies all served with one of the most seductive custards I have ever seen.If looks are anything like taste those things would have been dessert paradise.But I DID do the pies and the eels and one thing is certain.This is a restaurant not to be missed.If you are in Greenwich for a limited time and you MUST pick between Goddard's and the Observatory ...Skip the Observatory.Easy call.",

The service was very heartwarming just like how we received our pies. The pricing was inexpensive, if I could eat 2 pies because how cheap they charge each, I will - lol. The serving size was huge but if you are a big eater- a pretty standard size then. The delivery of the food was fast - I was not ready yet as I am too occupied taking photos and my name was called in less than 5 minutes. The taste - bland as how English food is known for but for a change- it was just right for me, besides it is how you want your pie be made - add more sides if needed but the one with \u00a0parsley sauce was what I enjoyed most. And by the way - their London pride beer was considered one of the best beer my husband has tried. \u00a0The place is small but the turn around was quick. They have second floor to backed up the number of customers trying to dine in. Tourists - highly recommended when you are in the area.",

    "text": "Goddards at Greenwich is famous for serving London's most traditional meal of pie mash and liquor. This meal can be traced back through the 1800's and is an important part of London's food history. Goddards is still a family run business and has been serving pie and mash since 1890.Traditional 'Pie and Mash' really is a London only dish. It's funny, that although I live north of the river Thames, the ones you get in south London, always seem to taste better. Goodards is a good example of where you can get a good traditional 'Pie and Mash'. Although you can get steak, chicken, lamb and vegetarian pies here as an alternative to the traditional pie. If you go for an alternative pie though you are missing the point. Th real pie you have to try is the traditional pie made of 100% minced beef, with mash and liquor. Splash on some malt vinegar to give it that something extra. Don't spoil it by going for gravy, always go for the liquor. It's like a runny parsley sauce, but combined with the vinigar, it's to die for.By the late 19th century, there were over 100 Pie and mash shops in London. Nowdays they are much more difficult to find. I would urge any visitor to London, to try it as it really is a unique London only dish. Probably it's most famous fan is David Beckham, who goes to a Pie & Mash shop when he visits London for his favourite meal.When I host visitors to London, I always take them on the boat from Westminster Pier to Greenwich taking in the best views an commentary along the Thames, followed by a Pie and Mash lunch at Goddards whilst in Greenwich . It really can be the best day out, with a real London feel. For a decent meal for about \u00a35, you can't go wrong!!",

The place is not that big, they have limited seatings. They have homemade pies which are just awesome.I just loved the chicken and mushroom pie.",

Service was friendly and ate in the upstairs dining room. Taste was a little bland but was expecting it as this had local taste bud popularity written all over it.",
