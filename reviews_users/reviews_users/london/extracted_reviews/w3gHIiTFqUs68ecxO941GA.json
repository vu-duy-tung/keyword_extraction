I was not impressed this time around. The owner seemed annoyed that we hadn't booked a table. They seemed overly concerned with the party of 14-odd who were celebrate some birthday and didn't pay much attention to the rest of the patrons. We had to wait 20 minutes to place an order, another 45 to wait for the food. The food was pretty good but the portions did seem smaller and the prices slightly dearer. Opted not to have dessert and getting our bill was another mission. On the way out, we spotted 2 of the 3 waiters having a cigarette break at the same time. Hmm. Service.",

Dinner - went for the jerk chicken roti wrap. Fantastic. Next time I am going to go for the curry selection, it looked and smelled delicious. Really liked the bring-your-own action. Just note, it is a \u00a32.50 corkage per person regardless of how much you drink, so it can make a can of beer a bit pricey! Just means you need to drink more. Breakfast - enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere for breakfast. The Negril breakfast with jerk sausage was delicious. Both times the service was friendly, but not necessarily speedy.

I have a slight problem where by if I order something with 'wedge' in the title then I need something to dip it in, I suggested ketchup but the lady I asked said 'try this', lime mayonnaise, the perfect accompaniment to plantain wedges! The woman is a genius! It's a bring your own restaurant with a small corkage fee so stock up and enjoy the evening. This is a local place for local people so sit back and trust Negril to bring the Caribbean to you, it's the perfect place for a relaxing evening with friends.",

The food is Caribbean and obviously serves up a wonderful fresh and organic jerk chicken if that's your thing, but a big chunk of the menu caters for the veggie audience. Lovely mixed bean and pumkin curries, rice with coconut milk and peas mmmm. Really simple, fresh, hearty and healthy food right in the heart of Brixton - love it. Apparently their breakfasts are to die for, so I'll probably be going back for one of those very soon! Definitely worth a visit, even if you don't live in the area. Lovely outside seating too, but not so good for those chilly nights that are nearly upon us",

Anybody who knows me, knows I don't do waiting, and on my last visit I spent more time trying to catch the eye of a member of staff, than I did anything else. I like Negril, but I can't accept bad service. Being seated, ordering and the food arriving was fine (even though that wasn't great, but I'll come back to that), but after we had finished eating, it took a little while to take our plates away - ok I can cope with that too. However we waited about 20 minutes (perhaps longer) before we were able to get somebodies attention to ask which desserts they had. Yes, we had to ask them! After the woman told us, she walked away and didn't return to ask of we actually wanted anything. Needless to say we were far to irritated at the point to proceed so we decided to ask for the bill. The story does go on but it's to frustrating & dull to bother with the details. It took a further 10 minutes and 3 request to actually receive the bill.I had the curry goat with rice and peas. The curry goat was rather bland with no bite to it at all, and the rice and pea was not prepared the 'proper way' with coconut milk and a fresh scotch bonnet, or at least it didn't taste like it did.Poor show people, poor show.",

As a result I mush mush mushed the girls up the hill to this little place that I had heard such great things about.Now this has to be hands down one of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life. Table for 5, no problem. BYOB, no problem. We are just waiting for our friends, no problem. They were so laid back, it was almost horizontal! But that didn't mean that the service was sloppy or that the food took ages. Quite the opposite. A friendly helpful waitress who dealt with the whole place on her own and not only that, the chef actually comes out to deliver your food, piping hot goodness that it is. Sweet plantain wedges were completed perfectly when some uncultured person I was with demanded ketchup. The waitress suggested some sort of lime dip instead which was \"to die for\"!Now this is meat-tastic with ribs, chicken and goat on the menu, but being a true Jamaican spot it serves vegan and vegetarian dishes from their Rastafarian selection. Not only that but there is a wonderful looking breakfast menu and Blue Mountain coffee. So all in all, this tiny little spot was a perfect dinner location, I now have to go wash the ribs and BBQ sauce off my face, actually if I sleep with it still there I can have it for breakfast.",

The rice and peas were great, and even better were the plantain wedges.

Good because it saves on the cost of dinner. Bad because your group may end up drinking enough that someone asks out the waitress.

The memory I had of Negril was in all it's summer glory - colourful seating outside, big potted trees etc - but what we found, in the dark, was a much more reserved affair, only squinting from the street showed that there were people inside.Negril is warm and welcoming . We were shown to a table by the one and only serving staff and waited. I warned my lady friend about the potential 'Caribbean' service, but she turned out to be prompt and oh so friendly.We opted for the Negril Platter - \u00a322 of deliciousness. Jerk chicken, saltfish fritters, slaw, fries, plantain wedges, gravy, salad, roti, rice and peas. We chuckled to ourselves as the kind lady tried to squeeze all the individual serving dishes onto our small table for two. And what a feast it was. The food was simple yet delicious.Really enjoyed the atmosphere in here, it was so very chilled. Conversation all around and everyone very much enjoying their BYO booze. I'm knocking off one star for the price I guess. Caribbean food is normally cheap and tasty wherever you get it in Brixton - and this is fairly steep in comparison. I'd happily pay it again though. We'll be there next to check out their Sunday brunches. Jerk chicken sausages you say?!",

    "text": "I loved everything about Negril.Rather than reading what would inevitably turn into a long-winded confirmation post that relates my love, you can read this handy and more accessible list instead:1) The whole place has a genuinely family-run vibe about it. And, no, this doesn't equate to 'cheap' or 'Ikea'.2) The whole place has a genuinely laid-back vibe (perhaps because of its Caribbean heritage, but also see 1 above). Be aware, however, that this also probably means you'll receive very laid-back (ie, slow) service. But don't sweat it. You're in Jamaica.3) The al fresco dining space is rather large, and, despite being located right on top of the busy Brixton Hill, it is quiet, sunny (if you're lucky), intimate and boarded in by potted greenery.4) The menu has a sizeable vegan Rastafarian section, so Negril accommodates both the jerk-chicken-loving as well as the veggie-centric diner.5) While it wasn't available on my visit, Negril serves the \u00a0world-renowned Blue Mountain coffee. It's pricey, yes, but Negril is the only establishment in London that I've encountered to sell/brew it.6) BYO. And not just alcohol. Want to bring your favourite juice or fizzy drink to enjoy with your searingly hot jerk sauce? No problem.7) And, most importantly, Negril serves delicious, inexpensive and authentic food. \u00a0Try the plantain wedges with lime mayonnaise. Do it and thank me later.",

It took forever to have our order taken and we waited 50 minutes for our food (our choice was limited by staff). When it did arrive it was bland with dry chicken. I was really hoping for something authentic. My friend ordered a curry and this was also hugely disappointing with no hint of spice... just a gravy that didn't really take of anything. The bill at the end leaves a the only taste we had..bitter... VERY OVERPRICED.",

But when we arrived, we were told that because we were such a large group, we could only order from the platter menu--which only gives you two options. A curry platter or a jerk chicken platter. Not exactly what we were expecting. We were then left sitting for over an hour before they even took our order, sighting other large parties as the issue. But frankly I don't really care if there are other large parties. If they provide the seating shouldn't the kitchen be able to cope? \u00a0Maybe I should have put my laid back Caribbean brain in, but I'm not even sure that would have kept people's hungry tummies from being annoyed. When the food actually arrived it was quite good and really inexpensive, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of just 1. But I still probably won't be back.",

Service was very friendly. Food was not cheap, but portions were large. Appetizer, plus main, plus side left me completely stuffed.

Everything else was just bad - I mean REALLY bad. Roti skin - blandCurry goat - no flavor, no spice and HOW do you manage to have watery gravy with potatoes in the pot?!?! Ugh!Curry chicken - just as bland, flavorless and again watery gravy with potatoes in the pot. To top it all off, it ended up being approx. $75USD. THIS CANNOT BE LIFE! Whomever was in the kitchen needs to return to yard for lessons because this was HORRIBLE.

I think on the chicken it would have been juicy enough to cool it down a bit? The salt fish fritters were just a bit too stodgy and doughy for me, and again I found the fire sauce to be more of a burning taste, and not enjoyable heat.Three stars is pretty generous in my opinion given all the variables around service, wait time, and the lack of chicken, but they did try their best. \u00a0I'd like to think I'll be back to give it another go and finally get my jerk chicken!",

    "text": "It had been months and months since I last had a good Jamaican breakfast. With my cousin in town and ever lusting after Jamaican food, we decided we would take the 45 minute trip to Negril. We got there a little after 1pm. Fortunately for us, there wasn't much of a wait. We were seating, given menus and proceeded to get down to business. I had the ackee & salt fish with fried dumplings and a side of jerk sausage. it was so good I \"forgot\" to offer him some (super selfish, I know but it had been so long, I simply couldn't resist). And to be fair he had jerk chicken, plantain, rice and peas and a few other things I can't remember... It was all good! Oh, and the best part- I ordered coconut water, and it arrived freshly chopped in a coconut! At that point, I think I knew I would be back!Not the best I've ever had but pretty damn good! I'm planning on adding Negril to my every other week rotation. Highly recommended!!!!",

    "text": "I already reviewed Negril but now they have delivery and I have had the pleasure of ordering it, it seems only natural to re-review. Firstly, despite being a massive Negril fan since moving to SW London in 2012 I had reservations about getting a delivery. I don't mind leisurely service in the restaurant as I soak up the booze and the ambiance but I want my take away food delivered with speed. The advertised delivery time on Negril's website is 60 mins and I had a fear that they'd probably manage even that. \u00a0However, every order has been delivered (with a smile) in around 30 minutes! The food arrives piping hot it tastes every inch as good as it does in the restaurant itself. My only grumble is that they have a surcharge for paying by card",
