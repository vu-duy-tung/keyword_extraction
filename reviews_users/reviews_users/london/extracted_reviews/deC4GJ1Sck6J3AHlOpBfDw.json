This is a great little cafe tucked away under Waterloo railway bridge, opposite the tube station, and has served many a hungry commuter on their way home. Especially those who have recently departed from the Kings Arms on Roupell St. This is the place to get proper old fashioned fish and chips, with lashings of salt and vinegar and wrapped in paper. The staff are friendly, and service is always quick. If you eat in, there's a proper table service with plates and cutlery, but the quality of the food is exactly the same whatever your choice. It's also pretty cheap, and portions are very generous. Soft drinks are slightly overpriced, but that's the only fault I can identify.",

The chips are especially yummy and the batter on the fish is delicious and doesn't get soggy fast, which is a huge complaint of mine.

The batter had the perfect crispness, it was perfectly seasoned, and their other twists on the cod variety made with salmon was equally, well, delicious.I loved it so much so that while my mother and I were in London last year later on in the year, even though I wasn't the primary party for organizing travel and paying attention to the names of stops on the Tube when the boyfriend and I were there, taste-bud memories alone showed me the way. I was so desperately craving the same fish and chips goodness I had experienced a few months before, that I beelined to Fishcoteque the first night my mom and I arrived in London.The vinegar mixing with the flavor from the chips, combined with the tart and sweet relish from the Heinz Tartar Sauce dripping from the deep-fried salmon covered in breadcrumbs is worth the U.K. sojourn.

But then again, their fish isn't good and they're called fishcoteque, so really, what difference does it really make? The four of us ordered haddock and onion rings (free replacement from chips), cod and chips, and rock and onions to share with some gherkin (pickles). One thing that everything I just named have in common is that they are all soggy, with the onion rings being particularly under fried (still better than the freezer-burnt fries). All the dishes were about 9 GBP. \u00a0So some pain points:- all foods are soggy and flimsy- the rockfish comes with giant bone in (which kinda looked gross)- all fish had skin on under the batter- the haddock was better than the cod and rockfish- they use heinz tartar sauce in a package- takeaway is cheaper by a pound- the food wasn't good- neither was the service (i think the girl might have still been asleep)I don't particularly understand the high rating on Yelp, but you might want to take a look at the filtered reviews because they're all seem to be one star real reviews.",

    "text": "OK, the name is a bit campy, but this place is top notch -- clean, friendly, cheap, and delicious. My husband was looking for a cheap fish & chips place near a Tube stop; Fishcotheque fit the bill. For starters, the takeaway menu is ridiculously cheap (Remember in London, there's a price difference between eat in and takeaway!). A small fish & chips takeaway is 5,95; large is 6,95. My husband ate in the restaurant, so he paid 8,95 for a huge piece of crispy, golden fried cod and a plate of fries. It looked amazing (and apparently tasted quite good, too); the battered fish was golden and crunchy on the outside but flaky and tender on the inside. I tried the fries, which were OK, nothing to write home about. But the mushy peas I ordered were great. And they keep a bottle of malt vinegar handy on the tables (the way fish & chips were always eaten in my family). The waitress was friendly and helpful. And for vegetarians out there, they offer both a veggie AND black bean burger, so they haven't forgotten us. (NOTE: I didn't try either one, only noted them on the menu.)I subtracted one star for the big price difference between eat in and takeaway. IMO, three pounds' difference for a small fish plate is quite a premium, but the quality and atmosphere are well worth a visit.",

There were only two people working at the time so I was ok with waiting. The fish and chips came out hot and plentiful. I was a little disappointed because the batter fell off the fish pretty easily, and was less flavorful than the last batch I had. The chips also could have used a bit more salt, but it wasn't too bad.

And let me tell you, a large is large! I also got a side of mashed peas, curry sauce, and French fries (my British friend eats it like this so I just followed what he was doing). The fish itself wasn't bad. I found the batter to be a little greasy for my liking. I know, it's fried fish. But in a couple other places I tried, it wasn't as bad. Fish was fresh and cooked well. Seasoning was nice. French fries, or chips, were delicious though. Overall pretty good and has an awesome location! Right off the underground and near the river. Check it out! It's worth a try and they have all kinds of food. Staff is nice and attentive. Quick Tips: 1. Their burgers looked great. Give them a try. 2. Mashed peas are unique (to us Americans)! I recommend giving them a shot!",

    "text": "Decoration is quite funny.Cash only, no card. There are free ATM's at the station nearby.Staff was nice. Place is small, but didn't need booking (lunch on weekday). If you're around the area I'd say to go here.I had lost hope on fish & chips but this one was quite good. Was not oily at all, the fish was super soft and well cooked (the only reason I came here was because at the door it said they only bought fish of sustainable fishing and that it came from the Billingstone market. So yeah, recommended. The chips lacked salt but that's easy to solve (just put some salt on it) and not a problem for me. The portions are big enough for a meal so I'd say go for a medium size.Be careful because the price of fish is separated from the chips (because of different sizes) so it's not only \u00a37 to eat here.",

    "text": "I absolutely enjoyed my time here ! The prices were very good for the food and the food was delicious! And the service is pretty good, and the decor is so nice and vintage ! I ordered the mushy peas and a large cod which comes with chips which were really good. It was my first time eating mushy peas and it was surprisingly so good! And the fish was fried to perfection, crispy and flavorful with the perfect batter! The chips were also very good. Although I have to say, if you do order a large cod, it is made for sharing. But if you really have a big appetite I'd say go ahead and get the large haha. But they do have just regular size cod which is perfect for one. I enjoyed my lovely time here and the interior was one of my favourite parts of the restaurant! Totally recommend trying this place out !",

    "text": "The GF and I were around Waterloo Station one night, feeling a bit peckish for some fish and chips. We looked a good thirty minutes for a proper pub still serving food past midnight. Alas, none were available so we settled on Fishcoteque.Located along a busy street, the atmosphere inside was cozy and adorned with plenty of marine decor. Regular Cod & Chips [8.95 Pounds = $14.65]The GF went with the cod and chips. The fish was clean, light, and fluffy, with the crispy batter lending a great crunch to each bite. There wasn't much, if any, seasoning, but there was nothing a bit of salt and vinegar couldn't fix! The chips were well-fried as well, with a creaminess within. \u00a0Regular Haddock & Chips [8.95 Pounds = $14.65]The skin-on haddock was similar in texture, though with a finer flakiness and had some bones.Mushy Peas [1.95 Pounds = $3.19]The side of mushy peas were mushy indeed. More like split pea soup, the GF enjoyed them, though I thought they could've used a bit more seasoning.The check came in a cute maritime chest, with a few chocolate coins to boot! FYI - cash only.Service was friendly and Fishcoteque fit the bill for our fish and chip needs.",

The place has been around since 1974, so I think that's how they kept their clever name since the disco era. \u00a0Bright fluorescent lighting, and typical diner style furniture, doesn't make for anything romantic, but it is authentic. I think the large set us back $14 pounds, which I was surprised, especially factoring in the exchange rate, but it was ample enough for 2 people to share. \u00a0 The waitress was very nice and helpful.",
