    "text": "Now imagine being at the heart of Borough Market and walking past a stand, displaying fresh fishes, clams, squids and prawns. It is called the applebee's fish caf\u00e9. Not often used to such a sight in London - I have to stand there and watch. I start to compare prices and unfortunately Borough markets prices have gone up since it got such a tourist attraction.Spying to the back I discover there is a fish bar behind the display. People coming and \u00a0going enjoying a small meal. Now if you are a Londoner you might think twice, if you shall buy \u00a0a sea bass from \u00a0the fishmonger to cook at home or if you might have a taste of it in the back of the bar?As a visitor you normally get a little bit frustrated by the wealth of food, while not being able to buy any fresh food as living in a hotel.Unfortunately when we finally finished out Borough market hopping Applebee's closed the restaurant for two hours late afternoon. However, it not took us long to find this place again one evening the next week.It was a casual atmosphere sitting on high chairs and a little table having ordered starter such as the scallops with crispy bacon- excellent, prawns with peaches, rocket & chilli dressing (hard work as you have to peel them yourself) and grilled fillet of Mackerelwith crispy vegetables & sesame seed dressing - tasty!The 3 of us shared the fish platter of the day, the portion was more then generous. As I do am a fish gourmet it was a shame that particular the fish was a bit too much cooked through and makes the meat taste a little bit dry. I recommend sticking to the main menus; the fishmongers and waiters take special wishes on board, a flexibility, which needs to be appreciated.Also, if you pass by Applebee's and are a fish fan, you might as well can get a take away.",

    "text": "Delicious fishes My latest trip to Applebee's was my third, and by far the best. On previous visits, although the restaurant hadn't particularly disappointed, it hadn't particularly satisfied either. Through slow improvement, however, Applebee's is now at the top end of the London Bridge restaurants, and certainly several degrees superior to fish!, the alternative down the road. Starters were an inspired combination of a fresh Caesar salad with generous portions of hot smoked salmon and bacon. The salmon is strongly smoked, adding a touch of chilli-spice to the velvet-smooth Caesar sauce, and well complimenting the crisp lettuce shards. The croutons, although perhaps left in the sauce for too long, are joyfully full of herbal flavours, nicely rounding off a beautiful start to the meal. If the starters was a great re-imagining of a classic, the main course linguine was (to me at least) a great new idea. The pasta was combined with muscles, clams, crab meat and porcini mushrooms, for a dish that satisfied and filled in equal proportions. The saut\u00e9ed spinach ordered on the side was entirely superfluous, but perfect nonetheless. All of which might suggest that their core offering of perfectly cooked fresh fish has taken a back seat. In fact, this couldn't be less true - the grilled sea bass was perfectly cooked, deliciously moist and meaty. Whilst the accompanying chestnut sauce was somewhat lacking in oomph, it gave room for the vegetables to assert their own flavour. Most impressive though was where Applebee's had identified it's prior problems and worked to correct them. The coldness in the air is deftly defeated by cast-iron heaters strategically placed around the restaurant, leaving diners toasty-warm on even the coldest days. The service, whilst still a bit spotty, has gone from inattentive to spirited, adding a sparkle to the whole experience. Entirely recommended.",

I love seafood, better than that, I love FRESH seafood (I used to live in a landlocked area, it was not pretty). What better way to see what you're eating when you walk by earlier and their plethora of fish just sit there on ice, waiting to be taken like those puppies in the window.I took my mum, who is a big seafood fan like me, to this joint, and we weren't disappointed. She had the different filets of fish, and I had the bass with lobster sauce. However, as the Americanness in us hasn't rubbed off, we like starch with our plates. Sides. Sorry, we do. Prices were what you can expect, but I think it would have been nice to have added in a vegetable or two to the place. We literally ate fish, no chips, no baked potato (I guess that really is American)...zip, zilch, nada.So I will say this, if you're a seafood fanatic who loves dishes that showcase the seafood at its finest. Definitely go here. Food is fantastic, it might be leaving you for some more.I had to walk down to the nearest Tesco's or Sainsbury's wanting to nibble on a carrot or a bag of crisps...but we have all been there. :)",

The lady who oversees the operation is fab she always has a joke and can recommend the best things on the menu. My single favourite is the squid with aubergines to start (they even made a starter of this into a main course for me once that was AMAZING).We tend to choose a bar seat which overlooks the chefs working away which is really interesting and allows you to see how much hard work and dedication that goes into making the food there. For around \u00a380 you can get 2 starters 2 mains and a bottle of Prosecco/wine which is quite fair for the quality of food you get and the amazing juxtaposition of flavours. Scallops with sweet potato and bacon lardons is an amazing combination which I would have never had thought of. If you book more than 24 hours in advance for a saturday night, you get a huge 25% off the bill!!",

Deliciously filled with slaw and garlic shrimp, this was the kind of street food i live for. Being able to walk and tour the market while I ate was simply the best way to spend a gorgeous Friday afternoon. Just one ingredient of an experience that is sure to be a highlight of my time in London. I think a real bonus for American tourists is the name! i definitely got a kick out of this place sharing a name with the quintessential awful, overly processed, soulless American chain.

    "text": "First off, this is a review of the hot seafood wraps on the stand outside at lunch, not the fish shop itself. While the fish looks fresh and they have quite a variety, I source mine direct from Billingsgate so I've never tried it out. However, if the quality of the fish is anything like the quality of the wrap, then I might have to give it a go anyways.So the stand outside offers a massive selection of...2 items. Yep, just two and of course they are seafood related. You can pick a) garlic prawns or b) Cajun fish and garlic prawns. I personally recommend option b) as the Cajun seasoning on the fish is fantastic with robust hearty flavours somewhat reminiscent of the US South and a bit of zing to keep you interested. \u00a0I admit, I've passed by this place numerous times and never opted for it out of a fear that the fish may be the leavings of the day or week before. However, the smell was so enticing I just had to give it a go today. From talking with the cook, I learned that he selects the fish from the fresh stock each day depending on what stock levels are like, expected demand, and how he feels that morning. In my wrap there was a mix of salmon, cod, and haddock which provided a nice balance of flavour and substance. The fish is freshly grilled in front of you so no worries about it sitting there stewing all day (and the grilling is healthier than frying!) and then placed with crunchy veggies and some sauces in a warmed tortilla. All this happens while you wait so you know you are getting as fresh a wrap as possible. The sauces were a mild tomato based chilli sauce and a rich creamy white sauce with a hint of tartare. They went well although I would prefer more spice but then again I eat chilli sauce out of the bottle sometimes so I'm probably not the average spice junkie.Overall, for a fiver I'd hope for a \u00a0bit more food to fill me up but the freshness and flavours were excellent. The price is on par for Borough and I'm definitely keeping it in mind as a lighter lunch option for the Market.",

    "text": "Mmm seafood! \u00a0Went here for dinner the other night, and the food was excellent. \u00a0Probably liked the appetizers a bit better than the mains so would likely at least once go in and choose just 2-3 apps as my meal (you have to try the scallop app, WOW) and they have a decently priced wine list.Only downside and the reason why it misses on the elusive 5th star, is the service, at least when we were there on a busy, but busy SATURDAY night, the service was slow and poor, poor and slow. \u00a0It wasn't the worst experience with service I've ever had at a restaurant here in London but when you wait a 1/2 hour just to be able to order drinks? no no no.I'm really hoping that was a one-off service experience as I'll definitely be back for the reasonably priced and delicious seafood!",

It's not the fastest moving queue, but you get very tasty food at the end. They do two different wraps - one cajun fish, one with garlic prawns - you watch as the cute man makes it up, and then you're a fiver poorer and you've bagged yourself a tasty and healthy lunch. The wraps are filling, but you won't end up in a carb coma for the rest of the day. Always secretly disappointed about that, I actually like carb comas. If you're in the area at lunch and you've always wondered why there's a long queue at this place, go do the British thing and join it. It's one of the very best queues in South London.",

Now, I freely admit I'm not an a-fish-onado, so the delicacy of the Scottish sea trout main was somewhat wasted on me. But I really enjoyed both the scallop starter and cheesecake dessert.

The dishes are incredible and cooked right in front of you and their quality actually live up to the price tags. One thing that I disliked and the main reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the fact that the staff wasn't as attentive as I would like it to be.

Started with the sourdough bread and dip then had the fish and chips with mashed peas. It was a huge piece of fish BTW.

This breading is more like a \"fish and chips\" type of batter, which was light and crispy. The tiger prawns were large, and they were indeed prawns, not shrimps. They had a divine seafood sweetness that was so rich that they tasted almost like lobster. \u00a0What made this dish rock was the fresh house-made wasabi mayo that gave the prawns an extra kick in flavor but not overwhelming their natural sweetness.FISH AND CHIPS: \u00a0When you are in the Borough Market in London, you know you can't go wrong with fish and chips. The fish filet was freshly carved - as with everything else in the market, you won't find those frozen stuff out of a box. The batter was light and crispy; the fish was moist and juicy. \u00a0Sitting at the counter, it was a joy to witness our food being prepared and brought to us straight from the fryer when it was still piping hot.",

The mixed grilled fish platter house specialty with a chips or a rocket salad, which turned out rather fresh. The fish of the day was dover, which came grilled, with nice char marks. There was also a whole shrimp. Apparently this dish changes on the daily, though, so don't expect the same thing!Sea food salad came with mussels, squid, prawns, and scallops, as well as some greens and a citrusy dressing. Everything was fresh and flavorful, if a bit skimpy on the portions. Overall, wonderful quality. All of the fish were juicy. The produce was fresh.

Turns out - i had nothing to worry about! \u00a0Plenty of other patrons had chaps on too so I was right at home. \u00a0Some also had police hats and horsewhips - I guess they were mounted police. \u00a0This was just as warm and neighborly as my Applebees back in Indiana, but the menu is VERY different. \u00a0I ordered my typical Apple-Tini-Teaser\u2122 but unfortunately they didn't have that here. \u00a0Instead, I got a Pimms-Peppa-Pleasah\u2122.Service was excellent - they could tell i require food that could be eaten with my hands and recommended a garlic prawn wrap. \u00a0For us Americans, a prawn is like the buffalo of shrimp. \u00a0That's how my waiter, Travis, explained it to me.One note - spicy food and chaps don't mix. \u00a0I was 4 bites into my wonderful wrap before my giblets were accidentally immersed in horseradish. \u00a0Travis, my handsome waiter, pointed me to the restroom where i could baste my burning baubles and wash out my chaps. \u00a0Well, the water was hot but it got the job done with minimal scalding. \u00a0As patrons \u00a0pretend to ignore me squatting over the sink like a sumo wrestler squaring off, \u00a0I realize there are no hand towels to dry up. Instead, I would need to use the dreaded hand dryer. Everybody knows Applebees' hand dryers run HOT- so I was worried. Not here though. \u00a0Applebees London is all about freshness and class. \u00a0Instead, they have one of those Dyson hand dryers that harnesses the power of tornado to jet your hands dry. \u00a0Any port in a storm, I always say. \u00a0With a swift dunk, I would immediately realize this was no port, but rather the eye of a hurricane and my bits were suddenly \u00a0ensnared in Dyson's diabolical flesh tempest of torment from which no grapes escape unwrung.Like Chinese finger cuffs, \u00a0struggle only pulls you deeper into Dyson's depraved lure. \u00a0As the unrelenting cyclone stretched and coiled my dumplings into a fleshy pretzel, I began to pass out. Then I remembered advice I received picking apples at an orchard: twist, don't pull. With a gentle twist, \u00a0I broke free of Dyson's cruel wind. \u00a0I don't know what he has against bags, but Dyson's deceitful harvest would not include mine. Not today...Sore and blue, \u00a0once more Travis to the rescue. Such great service at Applebees!He knew what to do immediately, fetching some Greek yogurt and hummus from the kitchen saying with a wink \u00a0\"you're going to need this\". \u00a0 I'm sure it happens every day but it made me feel special and welcome.So besides the Prawn Wrap, \u00a0you should also check out the daily catch because everything is fresh, \u00a0local and brought in daily. Oysters. Trout. \u00a0Amazing. \u00a0I can't wait to come back! \u00a0And next time I won't fall prey to any of Dyson's duplicitous gambits.",

    "text": "I had wonderful experience here. It's in the heart of borough market next to a lovely strip of bars & other restaurants. I visited after going to the top of the Shard building which is a short walk away. It was great to find this place bc it was one of the only few to still be open later in the evening. My friend & I weren't in the mood for a large meal & wanted to save some money. We ordered a salad with bacon, mushrooms, avocado & a nice vinaigrette on top. Next was Cajun sweet potatoes and fried zucchini. Everything was well seasoned and cooked to the perfect temperature and texture. I really enjoyed this meal & strongly suggest it to anyone in the area. The bill was very reasonable & only about \u00a313 each.",

    "text": "No, not the hideous American chain Applebee's (as Jade V. says in her review below)..... but a quaint, lovely, delicious cafe/restaurant in Borough Market. Was lucky enough to get a table outside on a warm Spring evening. \u00a0At first I was suspicious as so many other restaurants were packed, but this one wasn't. In retrospect it was merely good timing. The scallop starter with celeriac mousse and green apple salad is to die for. A crisp mix of flavours, well suited to a balmy day outside. Interestingly similar to Jade V., I also had the seasonal mixed grilled fish platter, which is pretty much what is available that day (see photo I've uploaded). It was simply very fresh and perfectly cooked and served. It didn't need loads of flavouring, and the cooking of the simple fish taste from each type was allowed to come through on its own merits. \u00a0I was surprised by the ample portion size, and was quite full by the end. Staff were friendly and efficient, despite the fact they were rapidly quite busy. I was only let down by the wine. \u00a0I ordered a Viognier to start, which at \u00a328 for the bottle tasted more like a \u00a37.99 no-name bottle from the corner shop. I then ordered a carafe of Sauvignon Blanc which was merely ok. Other than that, if you like your fish it's definitely a place to check out.",

But a few hours following my last meal there, I became violently ill. I ended up in bed for over a week, ruining my entire trip to London. After returning to the U.S., I needed to see my GP and was prescribed antibiotics. What concerns me the most is that I wrote to the restaurant to alert them so they could ensure the safety of their food. The restaurant has not respond to my email. I have now suffered for over a week and a half, including a transatlantic flight home, and the restaurant can't be bothered to even acknowledge my email.",

    "text": "The restaurant itself is attractive and has a good atmosphere. Light and airy, it was the perfect location for a late lunch on a muggy day in early summer. The food? I don't know. It was ok. I had the haddock and chips, and while the chips were pretty tasty, the fish was rather bland.There were a couple of other things I didn't like. I asked for some mayonnaise and was directed to use my boyfriend's (who had three dips come as part of his meal) - when I asked for my own, I received rather a small portion and then had to get more 2/3 through the meal. There was also cucumber in the tap water, which I know is rather vogue but I absolutely hate it.My boyfriend was delighted with his trio of fish, though, particularly the swordfish, which was a new experience for him. Less impressed that the three sauces it came with were actually just mayonnaise, pesto and sweet chilli sauce (none of which were obviously freshly made). I think overall I'd go back if I was with somebody who wanted to go, but considering that it's on the pricey side, it wouldn't be something I'd recommend.",

    "text": "I suspected Applebee's might be disappointing, and unfortunately it fulfilled my expectations. I'd actually previously had their prawn wrap at lunchtime which I thought would be incredible but was in fact quite bland and used iceberg lettuce to which I have a particular aversion.So I was a little nervous when we picked this place for my post graduation dinner (yep, no pressure). It's a pricey menu and as it specialises in fish I would expect the fish dishes to be outstanding. I ordered monkfish which is probably my favourite fish and I think it's pretty hard not to make monkfish taste delicious - it naturally has a sweet rich flavour which does most of the work itself. This dish came paired with lobster, crab and I think prawn - basically all the seafood I love, but it really was not the sum of its parts. The fish was a little tough/overcooked and the bisque it came in insipid. Sad.I did better for my godmother, who I recommended tried the skate. This was actually very well cooked and tasty, although she found the copious amount of capers involved a little overwhelming.My dad had his favourite, dover sole, and again wasn't loving it.I did really enjoy the roasted new potatoes, I was starving and hoovered up a bowl in about 2 minutes.I wouldn't return here, it's too risky when you're spending a fair whack of money to end up with mediocre food.",
