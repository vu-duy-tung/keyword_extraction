Loud, raucous, centrally located, and filled to the brim with young and silly Fancy Dress parties, it is the ideal place to stop off for a quick pint or two in a kick-ass location.Being located so close to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, the National Portrait Gallery, and the bustling West End, The Chandos is a ridiculously popular place to \u00a0grab a drink As every review before mine has pointed out, this place is CROWDED. At all hours of the day. If you are lucky enough to find a space to hunker down, grab it and don't let it go as seats are insanely hard to come by. And the place is huuuuge, too; two huge floors of stools, booths, couches, and little alcoves, so it takes quite a lot of people to fill it up. And the Sammy Smiff prices mean that even if you're skint, you can have a totally decent night out here on the cheap. Wheeee!I can't really fault The Chandos for being unpleasantly crowded the way that some other pubs get. The patrons consist largely of stag parties and other fancy dress groups, so it is kind of hard to be peeved about having to squeeze between a Sexy Cop and a guy in a giant banana costume to get to the loo. If you're looking for a relaxed, civilized night out, you're definitely in the wrong place. If you love cheep beer, shouted/slurred drinking songs, and people watching of the ridiculous clientele, definitely give The Chandos an evening of your time.",

For those not familiar with Samuel Smith's you won't be finding any of the brand names or fancy bottled beers here. The Yorkshire run brewery does just that, they brew their own ales, stouts and lagers and that's all they sell in their pubs. All is not lost though as they have equivalents/alternatives to most of the mainstream brands and because they don't spend heaps on fancy ad campaigns for them they're much cheaper. Lager for example is \u00a32.15 a pint or \u00a32.90 if you go for the fancy continental version - both of which are very drinkable!That's Sam Smith's, so what about this particular pub... well it's a wee bit shabby but in your typical London pub way, more well worn-in than worn out, perfect for a few sneaky cheap drinks after work. They have a separate upstairs bar/lounge where you can order cheap food (scampi and chips/steak and ale pie type stuff). Probably not the kind of place you'd go to on a first date as you'd maybe want something a bit smarter but for more relaxed beers with friends/workmates it's perfect and ridiculously cheap for central London!",

It's lively and loud but not to the point of shouting conversations (also, no loud music playing in the background, thumbs up!).

As far as pubs go, this isn't the greatest but it has an excellent location a stone's throw away from Trafalgar Square. Essentially, it gets the job done but as with most places in this area it's usually rammed on the weekend. It is alright for large groups most of the time though due to the large size and as a Sam Smith's pub you do get a slightly different range of ales. But let's be honest, for most of us, brown ales taste remarkably similar but at least it's not a 'Spoons!Other than that, I don't have much to say about the Chandos. It has the usual selection of booze on offer and could easily be a copy of oh so many pubs. It's a place to get drunk, not experience London pub culture sadly and you are better off enjoying the drink deals at All Bar One or Pitcher & Piano franchises close by.",

It had been exactly what I had expected from an English pub: full of Brits (and not tourists), and not your poshy kind of Brit, but the regular working class of 30-50 year olds, no music (I despise this in American bars), and cheap delicious domestic beer (Samuel Smith!!!).The beer selection, despite being only Samuel Smith, were amazing, and Samuel Smith Imperial Stout tastes so much better from the tap than from the glass bottles you get in Boston, Its also cheap as balls. The characters you meet here are amazing and I am dying to come back. I had to leave early for my show, which was especially unfortunate since my brother and I had managed to pounce on a table as soon as a couple had left. I couldn't remember the name of the bar upon leaving, but luckily a little research and the fact that it was the closest Samuel Smith pub to St Martins in the Field made things a little easier.I have no comments on the food as I didn't have any (why I give it a 4 star), but I will be back next month and ready to come here again. I say anyone who loves a great cheap beer and what a pub should actually be like should definitely come here.",

I've managed to find this pub every time I've been to London since I was 14. \u00a0I just found out after a conversation with my Dad that this is where we celebrated when my family was granted permanent visa's to live in the US when I was ten. \u00a0That made me smile, I will always get a drink here when I visit London.",

I have to say that whenever I've been in there it's always been rammed & very lively - up & downstairs - but at least this shows that it is popular & a decent place for a relaxing, casual drink with friends. I also like that, even with its brilliant location (right near Charing Cross, the Strand, Trafalgar Square), it's not overrun by tourists and seems to be full of the workers on their way home variety instead.The Chandos has pleasant enough bar staff for a central London location & a decent variety of beers, ciders, ales, wines & basically whatever tipple you're after! Oh yeah & more importantly, good crisps!",

Just off Trafalgar Square it's a world away from the bustle and hustle on its doorstep, with dark wood, draft beers and a coolness that keeps the harshest excesses of summer 2013 at bay. London is a big city and this is an old establishment, but there's a homeliness to this place that let's everyone feel that they found it themselves: this can be your pub just as much as the chap nodding off over there, the small groups tucked away in the window-side booths, the city folk downing a swift pint before their journeys out to the suburbs. Make this your regular central London watering hole and time and again it won't disappoint.",

Reasonable priced self brewed lagers and ciders and a hella lot of wood and dimly lit areas. No music in here, so get your chat on.

Sensible!Downstairs was busy, but quitened down later. I've passed this pub when it has been absolutely rammed - so appreciate earlier comments re: seating, space and general popularity.Don't be put off, it's still a great place.I'd throughly recommend this and other Sam Smith pubs in London - there are over 20, I believe.",

    "text": "I come here every week with some friends so I do have a lot of affection for the place but I'll try to not let that blind me to it's faults! Firstly I adore Sam smith's pubs in general! Ambiance! No loud music! Cheap, cheap lager! Woo! The Chandos is a pretty good example of such and it's great to find pub slap bang in the middle of tourist land that is so... well I guess, unspoilt. Most of the other pubs in the neighbourhood are grottier and crowded-er, just through sheer day to day throng of people. The Chandos however manages to be avoid the scruffy and have a good mix of regulars, tourists and workers in. It has a nice historic pub decor, with the downstairs more drinking den and the upstairs 'opera' bar more for lounging. It's always, always crowded in the rush hour but upstairs is usually better. Actually, I just don't bother to even look downstairs anymore! I just head straight up to to the Opera Bar. Alcohol, other than beers is certainly more expensive but not out of the central London Price range. Lager and ale on tap so ridiculously cheap however The food is AWFUL! If I've not had chance to eat before I get there I'm stuck with it so I've tried most of the menu and it's dire beyond the dreams of dire. Stogy, stogy microwave veg (always carrots and peas!!!) and mush! AVOID AVOID! The McDonald's is just around the corner - GO THERE!! They used to have a really good menu but they changed it last year when the food menu was standardised across the Sam Smith's chain! A real shame as each pub had found a couple of good things that it did really well. The Chandos could do you a huge, huge bowl of curly fries for \u00a34.50. Alas! \u00a0 SO really good for as a happy spot for a drink with some pals, but avoid the food at all costs.",

It all tastes a little funny and different but it's abut a third of the price of any other pub in this area, overall making it a winner. They also have really cosy sofas so snuggle down in if you come here on a week night and want to get up close and personal with a date!

I've never been to the second floor where they serve food as all the fun is downstairs at the ground floor where there are decent cheese toasts and a humble selection of crisps and peanuts you can nibble while enjoying your drinks. There is a good selection of beers of which my boyfriend is a fan and I like the cocktails and wines they offer. This time I tried the white Zinfandel and I liked it.Hadn't I seen the rolls of toilet paper being stored on the bathroom floor, I would have given this place 5 stars... but I guess the more you drink, the less you start to care each time you go to the toilet and see these.

Or walking all over the city absorbing the beauty, culture and sights! \u00a0Having had my experience in the George Inn, I headed straight to the bartender and asked for fish & chips and tea. Of course, I was promptly told that warm drinks are served upstairs!Argh! Rules! I still had not mastered the British way!I headed upstairs and the barmaid took my order and gave me the portable table number (thing). \u00a0Being the super sociable person I am, I quickly found a hidden table behind a wall!The fish and chips were delicious & not greasy, the tea was sustaining, and the atmosphere (at around noon) was very quiet. Only few regulars and a tourist table were in the room that would easily handle 50+, or more!",

After a day of sightseeing and shopping, I was absolutely starving, and dead set on having one good pub meal. I knew I was in a real, honest-to-God pub when I opened up the menu and saw, among the steak-and-kidney pies and sticky toffee pudding, chicken tikka masala and Thai curry. Fabulous.My red pepper and feta quiche (pictured) came with the most delicious salad, so much so that I almost wish that it were the entree. (Although the quiche was pretty darn fabulous, too.) It was also great not to have to ask for vinegar to go with the chips (which were unfortunately a mite soggy).Honestly, though, what made this place was the ambiance, from the cheery server who kept calling me \"luv\", to the babble of different accents (read: tourist vs. local), to the quintessential Britishness of it all. Long live the pub.",

Which is odd, considering it being so close to Trafalgar Sq. I loved this pub. It was the quintessential cliche image of what an English pub looked like in my mind. I loved all the dark wood that flowed throughout the bottom space (I didn't go upstairs). And I love those booths where you can hide away and read a paper.I love the fact that the beers here are so fucking cheap! But, you'll have to order a Samuel Smith Stout because there ain't no Guinness here. That's fine, I drink Sam Smith back home. I ordered myself a pint and crammed myself in between two blokes and two birds.(giggles in delight at the access of English slang)I sat on an elongated cushioned bench against stained glass windows and just people watched. I watched and I listened. I love the colourful characters that were in here and the warm and people friendly Londoners, or the warmth the hooch brings them. I had an awesome conversation with the blokes sitting next to me and who could resist that charming accent? Come on!Sitting in this pub and drinking a stout, I connected with the Londoners faster in 15 minutes than I did spending 6 days in Paris. And for this, I'll be eternally grateful to this pub.DID I MENTION THE CHEAP ASS BEERS?!",

We had to creep and stalk for a while before we got a table upstairs. The place is a very traditional pub like with people standing, sitting on bar stools to booths, to couches, to single couch chairs/comfy fabric chairs etc. Oh, and its pretty chilly so girls, unless you drinking a good amount you might be chilly upstairs. As for the beer, I can't remember what we had but it was so creamy and smooth, delicious. The food we ordered was fish and chips, chicken masala or something like that and a bunch of those meat pies things (see pics). I have to say honestly none of the food was that good since its pub food lol, so make sure your drinking when your eating here. And considering I can't really drink, wasn't that much fun being their eating pub food sober -_-. lol, but if I could drink I think I would have liked this place more. Oh, and this pub is kid friendly, lots of families when I went. Overall, nice little pub, beer is good, food is meh when your sober, make sure your drinking when you eat the food like all pub/bar food lol. Not a fan as I probably wouldn't go back but its okay.",

I chose this place based on the Yelp reviews.We headed upstairs as there were clear signs telling us food was upstairs. As with most pubs, you sit yourself down wherever you like and order at the bar.They have a really great drinks selection which is why my review is 3 not 2 stars. Staff were extremely friendly. I had a lovely apricot beer. There were a few fruit beers, a wide array of ale on tap and in bottles, ciders, spirits etc.Food was standard pub grub- burgers, so on. As it was a chain pub I assumed the food would be pretty good as you can usually count on a pub for a good, filling meal. I chose fish and chips. The chips were fine but I found the fish undercooked- it was hot but had an odd texture. It came out really quickly so I suppose they just bash everything out.It's not too surprising that the quality isn't great as it's in a very touristy area. I would definitely check this place out for the drinks and maybe get yourself a bowl of chips.",

If downstairs is full, you can usually find a seat upstairs (even if your not eating). Good for one drink if you are passing by.. As it can be loud and busy due to it's location on the 'tourist trail'.",

    "text": "One of the great London metropolitan pubs, just across from the National Portrait Gallery. Every visit of mine to London will inevitably result in at least half a dozen stints at this fine pub - and a dozen or more pints from their great range of Samuel Smith beers (and you can only get beers here from this brewery!). In recent years (after 2012) prices for beer in London have gone up rather sharply, so expect to pay UKP 4.90 for a pint of their signature lager, Pure Brewed Organic Lager - which is still cheaper than what an inferior lager will go for at other pubs in the area. Cheaper alternatives (like the Double-Brewed Lager or the Alpine and Taddy lagers) are available, but they are just not quite as good. A good, inexpensive option is the oak cask-aged Old Brewery Bitter, which is rather aromatic and costs below UKP 4. Various fruit beers are also available (Cherry, Strawberry, Raspberry & Apricot), but only from the bottle - they're good but don't come cheap at 5.70 for 355ml. Also, Samuel Smith makes one of the very few authentic German wheat beers, the Organic Wheat, in all of England - many have tried, but few have succeeded. It's also UKP 4.90/pint and on tap (as of August 2018). Other beers from their range - all of them from the bottle - that I can safely recommend are the Imperial Russian Stout, the Nut Brown Ale, the Oatmeal Stout, and the Taddy Porter. Nothing has changed d\u00e9cor-wise over the 14 years I've been frequenting The Chandos during my annual summer holidays (and several other trips to London): Particularly attractive, and correspondingly in demand, are the cute alcoves you can sit in, with their decorated stained glass windows and the large tables and comparatively comfortable benches. During peak hours you might as well forget about securing a place for you there. But the whole pub is rather comely, with its dark wooden furniture and the classy, old fashioned bar.They did however renovate the toilets (to be found in the basement) in recent years, and boy, was it necessary. I remember trying to find my way through the gents' loo with the flashlight of my smart phone when the lights were out - and the picture wasn't great. In August of 2018, I can happily report that the facilities I found were both neat and clean.On the upper level you will find the restaurant area (though you can also have meals on the ground floor), and that's the one quibble I have with their self-perception: The pub grub here is certainly competitive in price, but, personally, I wouldn't use the term \"excellent\" for it. I've had lunch there on a few occasions, and what I got was only standard pub food. Maybe they have improved in the past 5 years.The bar staff (mostly young men in their twenties) are very friendly indeed, and they're certainly doing their best trying to keep up with the queue of punters that will flood the place after office hours. So the best time to visit for a relaxed pint, sitting in an alcove, will be sometime soon after 12 a.m. - maybe after a visit to the National Gallery or National Portrait Gallery.",

I do want to recommend a veggie burger, which much to my surprise turned out to make my Top 10 list for veggie burgers worldwide. Served on a soft bun, it's a quinoa patty, fried perhaps with panko coating to give it some crunch, and with a discrete number of edamame beans thrown in. Excellent! The upstairs Opera Room, complete with with a variety of diva-themed posters and photos, is a pleasant enough space. If you've been walking all over the National Gallery across the street, this is a good place to stop in for a pint and quick lunch or a snack. As another Yelper put it, there's really nothing to complain about here.",

The dining area is very cozy and we grabbed a table in the back. The food was really good! The fish was perfectly crispy as were the chips, and the side of pees was delicious as well.

Looked like 2 frazzled servers trying to keep up. No sign of food or menu anywhere. Then we saw the sign that food was served upstairs. Saved? Nope. Equally packed, less servers, no menus and no one eating. Not a single person having food. I guess if you're a 20 something hanging out and having a few beers this is the place to go. Just wasn't what we expected based on other reviews.",

But you are not in cheap surroundings, there are some fantastic seating areas, comfy sofas, little snugs, the lot. The pub has two levels, the nicest being the cosier upstairs in my opinion, though this will give you a journey down two levels to get to the toilets, which is the only drawback to this place.",

Owned by the Samuel Smith's chain, you are guaranteed a wide range of their own-branded beers, lagers and even spirits at credit-crunch-friendly prices. The pub's nicely done up, with a standy-uppy downstairs bar, and a more cosy upstairs area with some tables. Getting a seat is pretty much a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, so enjoy it if it happens (I'm writing this because I got my first ever Chandos Seat last night - yay!) The pub, as other reviewers have mentioned, is usually crammed full, but this lends itself to a pleasantly buzzy atmosphere. It's nice to wander out, suitably fortified, and be on Trafalgar Square with St Martin-in-the-Fields right next to you, Nelson's Column and the National Gallery right ahead you get the picture.",

There are so many padded chairs and sofas that if you're not sitting down you're doing something wrong. There are toilets for the upstairs bar hidden away at the far end, at a slightly higher level which reminded me of the ones in the Odeon in Manchester. This is a Samuel Smiths pub, so the beer and spirits are cheap and very good quality. Dare I say the best in London? Certainly the best value, about two pounds a pint (in London!!!) Since this bar catered to actors and singers, there are loads of photos of old stars on the wall, and a real club feel to the old place. Particularly when it's cold enough to have the coal fire burning. The staff were always attentive to me, but tended to ignore my Thai friend, so draw your own conclusions. I've also seen people playing board games in here, which I think they brought with them, so it's that kind of bar.",
