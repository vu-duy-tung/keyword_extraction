It seems to be the 1st choice for any birthday or catch upas it manages to combine a sense of occasion without feeling stuffy orold. That said it has a wonderful, traditional feel thanks to theattention to detail that all the staff give as well as the actual decor. If youhave to wait in their small bar area for your table \u00a0it is never for long andthey mix a great drink so just relax and enjoy the whole experience. You canexpect the food to be spot on every time. My Godmother and I love this place asthey always have such a good fish selection on the menu. If you are luckyenough to be invited to the member bar and restaurant do go \u00a0the dark woodexterior is quiet unexpected after the bright light of the flower shop (whichis how we entered) and the lift that takes you to all floors and glassstaircase makes you feel a bit like the snow queen (or maybe the fact it waswinter and we were in arctic fox added to that!). For what it is prices arefair, I've eaten in ghastly places for a lot more. This place in not trying tobe anything more than it is \u00a0but that just happens to be a reallyfantastic and place for lunch or dinner.",

This really is a lovely, good-humoured restaurant that doesn't take anything too seriously. The staff are excellent. If you've got a special occasion (or just want to chance booking a table), you'll have a lovely time. Foodwise, the much-vaunted shepherds pie is a bit so-so, but the bang bang chicken started is utterly sublime. If you like oysters, those are really good too, and the foie gras had my friend making all sorts of wrong sex faces for the duration, and thanking the chef afterwards. Every meal at The Ivy is special. It's like a glass of Champagne in itself.",

It does indeed serve some classic british foods, such as Shepherds pie - which by the way, is to die for, but it is all excellently prepared and served and have never had cause to complain about anything. The service is outstanding and the prices, although slightly on the high side, I still thought they were very reasonable for the quality of the food and the service. We wer \u00a3320 on our last visit. That was for 4 people having 2 courses and then another 3 having pudding, 2 bottles of wine, 2 bottles of water and 8 champagne cocktails.I didn't think it was over-expensive at all for the quality of food and service we received. Everyone from the doorman to the clockroom assistant to the bar staff and waiters were all excellent and extremely helpful and attentive. 5*",

By far one of the best service staff I have ever seen.Appetizers were excellent- I had foie gras and the girlfriend had the steak tartare. Mine was perfectly cooked and hers was perfectly seasoned.For the main course I fish and chips... I wanted to go for something fancier but I could not resist finding out what fish and chips could be like at one of London's best restaurants. They were very good, but I felt like I should have gone for something better. She had lamb which she said was excellent.The dessert was outstanding. Definitely try the dessert with frozen berries and melted white chocolate sauce.All in all for 2 people with appetizers, main course, one shared dessert and a bottle of wine cost around 120. Not somewhere I could afford every weekend but it was a lot more reasonable then I expected.so why only 4 stars? I thought the decor was a bit strange- it felt \u00a0to me like being in an old steakhouse. Also- the menu said no photographs which kind of irritated me. Not that I was going to go and take lots of photos of everyone, but maybe just one or two of ourselves to remember the occasion.",

Go there with the view you'll maybe see Michael Winner and eat some mediocre food... and you'll get just that.The Ivy has really been the 'It' restaurant of the past few years. And maybe a few years ago it actually had to rely on the food rather than who dined there last week. I think that it's got a bit up itself, and unfortunately you'll ending up paying a lot for standard food.So what is good about this place? The service is good, however I'd expect if you're minted and shagging some footballer you'd get much more attention. The food is ok, but you can get much better for much MUCH less cash.I think a lot of people actually go there to feel a little bit famous for the night. When I went there were paps hanging around (so maybe there was some D Lister inside) but it did feel great for that split second when they thought I might have been a WAG or media-type and they got their cameras ready. Before they realised I was Miss Jo Bloggs and their attention returned to their fags and coffee.All in all, you have to go there just once, to say you've been, but don't expect great food, or great service, or to see a celeb and you'll be fine.",

Starters range from \u00a37-15 (unless you fancy the caviar at \u00a390!), and the mains include shellfish, fish, pasta and various meat dishes and range from around \u00a311-40. I chose a glass of red wine, Bang Bang chicken followed by slow-roasted pork with mash and cabbage. The service was good, the food excellent, and the price around \u00a334. I called early in the week and it was still busy: so if you definitely want to get in it would be better to book in advance.",

But lunchtimes, weekdays or even just walking in off the street will see you with a good chance of a table straight away. The food is aimed fairly and squarely at comfort eating; English classics like Shepherd's Pie, Lobster and chips, Oriental favourites - all served by attentive, quiet and efficient staff. The drinks bill won't knock you out and the food too is priced very competitively - especially bearing in mind they could charge what they wanted and still fill the place ten times over. My wife, probably because she's female and notices these things, is in awe of the Ladies toilets there. I wouldn't know - as I go in the other ones - but it might be worth checking out. All in all - as a package - one of the best experiences you'll get in London for under three hundred quid.",

We didn't see anyone famous, and I felt incredibly over-dressed since plenty of people were coming in in jeans.

    "text": "I have heard many things about The Ivy. Mostly from my Brother, who goes on about it as if it is the greatest restaurant of all time.Apparently, one of the attractions of the Ivy is that it is a magnet for celebrities. Fortunately, on the night we went, there were virtually none. In fact, the only world famous person there was me, but thankfully nobody noticed me. Nobody noticed my Father either, it seems, when the waiter accidentally punched him in the face for no reason. Yes, that really did happen, and no, I don't think he really meant it. For Starters I had Partridge, which I have been told is some kind of bird. It was delicious! Partridge on Toast, fantastic! If only I had a cheap and steady supply of Partridge at home --- it beats beans on toast any day of the week (apart from Thursdays, when beans stage a small comeback).My main course was Shepherds Pie. It was small and plain looking and I grumpily wondered, 'Is this it?' But after about three and a half bites I was full; the food was so rich! And I mean that in a good way, in a complimentary way. Although, the gravy had this weird sweet-sickly-ness to it which made it hard to finish. The atmosphere is certainly intriguing at The Ivy. Everyone sits next to eachother 'facing out', seemingly so they can see if any celebrities enter. That's what creeped me out a little, it was as if people go there just to see the famous -- whereas I think, if I want to see famous people, I'll just turn the TV on. The mild pretentiousness that the restaurant undoubtedly carries -- it's hard to tell if that's purely because of the people that eat there, or something that has been nurtured by the restaurant in aide of their reputation. I don't know. I ate there a few weeks back, for the first time, with my family; all of whom had been there before. They all said it was the worst meal they've had at The Ivy, so perhaps I caught a bad day. The thing is, though, when you go somewhere like The Ivy, which is very expensive for the average Joe, you want to be blown away, you want it to be magic.And perhaps I put my hopes too high. 'The Ivy' is okay, it's decent, it has a coolness about it but also a pretentiousness that I don't particularly love. I'd never purposefully choose to go there myself, but would be happy to go if someone invited me, especially if they were paying!",

Anyway, the service was excellent as is expected in an upscale place like this. I ordered the spinach ravioli which was fair. My friend got the steak which was good. Her husband got the sticky toffee pudding for dessert which he loved. All in all the food was good but it didnt impress me for the price/hype.Celebrity sighting: Benji Madden from Good Charlotte",

I had made reservations for my girlfriend's birthday (no longer together, the slag) but she became so ill that she required a visit to the hospital. I phoned The Ivy on the day of our reservation and explained the situation. They had my credit card information and said they had to charge me if I don't show up, and no reason seemed to matter to them. Finally, after some clever linguistic/sales skills on my part, i convinced them to let me book a reservation for the week after, but it was a headache dealing with them.So the following week the slag was better and we dined at The Ivy. The waiting staff was excellent; no problems there. However, for all the hype the food wasn't excellent, just average. I was a bit chafed I paid for an expensive meal that was only average, and that the person I had to deal with on the phone was a real ass. Oh well, we live and learn.",

So we are walking around Saturday night, it's about 8pm, we're all hungry, then we see a map, it has The Ivy listed. \u00a0I say lets go there. \u00a0Fortunately we are all dressed up, Thomas Pink shirts etc. \u00a0 Friend has ass length blond hair and kind of looks like a rock star. \u00a0So we power up to The Ivy, blow past the door man (remember I think this is a pub) and he says \"do you have a reservation\", I say \"do we need one\", he says \"of course not\". \u00a0So we go in, my miscalculation is now evident, definitely \"not\" a pub. \u00a0 But hey, what are we going to do, turn and walk? \u00a0Hell no. \u00a0The maitre d said we could be seated in a few minutes, not bad for Saturday at 8pm, but we could only have the table for 2hrs. \u00a0Perfect.We are seated, the waiter was extraordinary. \u00a0We all got drinks, ordered a bottle of wine, steak tartare, hamachi sashimi, 2 ribeyes, and the pork sausage dish. \u00a0Oh and a bottle of very nice Kabinett. \u00a0The food was so freaking good I did not know if I should rub it on myself or eat it, I chose the later. \u00a0Service was flawless, I split hollandaise on my Thomas Pink shirt and had soda water and a towel before I knew it was there. \u00a0The bill was not any more than we would have paid at a nice restaurant in LA. \u00a0Wow, I miss this place. \u00a0What a perfect night.",

    "text": "Coming back into The Ivy, stationed on Covent Garden's West Street for the last 90 years, is like sliding into a favourite chair, or pulling on 'that' pair of jeans. It's somewhere that makes you feel comfortable and cosseted. Whether you're going there weekly, or for your first visit, once you're on the other side of the stained glass panelled windows, you're treated like you belong.The sense of history at the restaurant comes more from the staff than the decor. It's not a formula, they're all allowed to express their own personalities and behave like, well, human beings. Compared to some of the Michelin starred restaurants in town, with their robotic teams of perfectly drilled matched staff, that's got to be a positive. They keep their staff, and move them round within the Caprice Holdings Group (for of course it is they, along with Sheekeys, Scotts, Caprice and newer sibling the Dean Street Townhouse) and there are enough people on their board of directors who have been with the business for 20 years or more who worked their way up. Jesus Adorno (with Le Caprice since the day it opened in 1981), Fernando Piero (the formidably cultured director of The Ivy) and chief exec Des MacDonald are, for some, better known than most restauranteurs.I used to be brought in here by suppliers and clients, when I worked more regularly in the theatre, and you could always spot those who didn't go there often. They would call you up with a time and date, clutched like a golden ticket, their voices quavering with excitement, two months out. The Ivy doesn't work like that. Like most top restaurants, they dress the room keeping back tables for nearer the time, to ensure that the right mix of people fill the space (a balance of industry, entertainment, old friends and the odd rubbernecker). It's more casual than many think, shhhh... they now take some (non peak) bookings online...Warning signs should flash here. It's NOT somewhere for a special meal. It's a good, rising to great, local restaurant. So often do you see or hear people comparing unfavourably to Le Gavroche or Royal Hospital Road, but truth be told, it's not trying to compete. The food focusses on simple ingredients, cooked well, British cuisine with some (very loose) Med influences and a strong focus on matching seasonality with their old favourites. Yes they have a pasta list, but you could sample their expertly made gnocchi following a starter of caviar or tuna sashimi. The winelist is extensive, intelligent and full of enough surprises at all levels. A standout Douro and an aromatic Gavi di Gavi are highlights on a small list by the glass.I go for a spicily perfect Steak Tartare that comes with fresh toast (seemlessly replaced when I run out), my guest's Beetroot and Goat's cheese salad comes studded with tiny blue edible flowers and a rapeseed oil dressing. I enschew the usual shepherd's pie (one of their more famed dishes, rightly so, along with an excellent burger and a surprisingly good, though inauthentic curry - see what I mean about it being simple food here?) and go for a meaty and thick monkfish tail (one of several daily, seasonal specials) served with saltily spiky coastal greens and a butter sauce. My guest had a Blythbourne Pork Belly with lentils, morcilla and peas. Sated, we skipped dessert, though I could recommend a slate of frozen Scandinavian Berries with a hot white chocolate sauce, another regular on a groaning dessert list. We take coffee and try to recover.",

    "text": "The Ivy is a restaurant that lends itself to lofty expectations--from the neighborhood to the reactions of the people who were very impressed that I was to be dining at The Ivy to the amazing service and food. \u00a0However legendary the experience is meant to be however--and I did find it both delicious and pleasant--it is ultimately not one of those experiences you'll remember forever the way its built up to be.When I told anyone that asked about my party's dinner reservation at the Ivy, they were quite impressed, so my expectations were soaring. \u00a0We arrived before the remainder of our party, so we went to the bar. \u00a0Right off the bat I wasn't impressed as the bar was small and the \"bar area\" was even smaller. \u00a0The drink list however was extensive, so not to worry.Once seated, I couldn't exactly get past how cramped the whole place was, but this was a common thread at all the places I'd eaten this trip. \u00a0The service--if you can believe it--actually seemed to thrive in this atmosphere, moving the table to allow you to sit (instead of pulling your chair out for you).Can't say enough about the service, which is beyond top notch in every imagineable way, from the serving of the food to the presenting of the menu, which brings me to the food itself. \u00a0To be completely honest, I was disappointed with the menu, expecting more fancy options, and just more options in general. \u00a0I was extremely happy with my choices however. \u00a0I had a gnocci appetiser which was (no exaggeration) the best gnocci I've ever had in my entire life. \u00a0My main course was a deliciously tender and juicy porkbelly. \u00a0With help from the large table, we sampled an array of the available desserts all of which were fantastic.All in all, this was a really really top notch meal, complete with three courses and fantastic service. \u00a0HOWEVER, if you find yourself in London with your heart set on eating at The Ivy and for some reason you can't get a reservation or a table, there's no question in mind that you can get something comporable at a different high end restaurant in the area or out of it.",

    "text": "One of two great restaurants we've eaten at in our neighbourhood, which is the Covent Garden area, The Ivy is supposed to be a high-profile-celebs-eatery/hangout. Well, I wouldn't know about that, since we've only eaten there twice and both times downstairs, not up in the dark-secret-sshhh-you-don't-know-I'm-here-room. The Ivy has food that is actually perfectly prepared from scratch from fresh ingredients. I know. Amazing concept, eh? Too bad very few other restaurants in London have figured out this simple approach. Yes, it can be hard to get a last-minute table, unless you are willing to eat early or very late. The first time we booked several weeks in advance for a Sunday night with relatives, the second time we only gave them a few days' notice and both times we were able to be accommodated within an hour of our preferred time, which was fine.Our first dinner was not as spectacular as the second, but that's because the first time our guests were paying (not us) so I had a less-expensive option. The second time I took a chance and ordered the lobster, which I've eaten all over the world, including famous lobster joints in New York City, to greater or lesser success. Some of the fanciest lobster restaurants serve you an animal that is overcooked and rubbery, and some of the simplest ones have given the best result. Before this night, my most memorable lobster was eaten in a small, inexpensive family restaurant in Roundstone, Connemara, Ireland. Perfect, simple, tender, delicious. Was caught in the bay right in front of the restaurant and steamed and served with a simple butter/parsley sauce that wasn't even necessary, the lobster was so good. Until my meal at The Ivy I had pretty much decided that unless I went back to Galway, I would never taste lobster that good again. But it was perfect, just as fresh and just as delicious and simply prepared. I didn't need the little bowl of fresh-cut and fried chips (but needless to say, I ate them anyway, The Ivy's chips are great!) because the lobster on its own was so good. Difference in price? Considerable. The Roundstone lobster with a full compliment of sides, fresh veg and chips, was 19 Irish Punts (in 1996). The Ivy lobster was something like \u00a335 and the chips and salad were extra. But definitely worth it for a special treat, and when you've gotten oh, so tired of being served horrible food from the rest of the places in London.My husband had fish and chips and mushy peas, made from fresh-caught fish and fresh new minted peas, and pronounced it the best F&C he'd ever eaten. Our guests had steak and ditto. No one had a bad meal there and we were only sorry we were too full after licking our plates clean to indulge in some of the obviously amazing-looking desserts the next table over were sharing to great acclaim and gusto.We were treated as though we were important and special (which, of course we are! Only they couldn't know that....) and as valued a set of customers as Madonna and Sting upstairs. Or whoever it was that night in the hush-hush room.We will definitely eat at The Ivy again when we return to our London home from Canada. I keep having dreams about that lobster....",

If you order this dish, be prepared to get messy and sit in a position with plenty of elbow room --- you'll need it!The shellfish bisque was also one of my favorite starters! Loved it! I wished I would have ordered the Shepard's Pie, what was I thinking? I've never had Shepard's pie before but hear it's great traditional English comfort food.The ambiance is exactly like their website, same color palette and has a very simple, yet elegant feel. It's decor is the opposite of what you'd expect from Nobu, but you already knew that...As you may know from my previous reviews, I'm HUGE on customer service. The entire staff was friendly and helpful as expected. If it were any different, you bet I would tell you about it here :)",

Then they only had a table available at 10.30pm but obviously didnt want to have to wait another 6months to make sure that we got this date (it was a birthday) so just had to go late.The food was ok, but nothing to really wow you! But then this could be a plus side as the menu had favourite classics like shepards pie and burger and chips! If you wanted to go spending a fourtune and breaking the bank you could - if you wanted to take it easily, then this was possible all so. We only really went as we have heard how exculsive this place was and wanted to see what all the fuss was about really! We saw one of the girls from girls alloud in there and that horse racing bloke John Mcriccick? So i guess it really is the place where the celebs hang out!All in all, i thought it was a lovely experience and i am glad that we went. Probably would do it again though as i have done this now and there are plenty of other resturants with waiting lists!",

It's beautiful, serves lovely food at very reasonable prices and the service is exquisite. I often meet a friend here and I'm the one that gets to places early. The staff always make me feel at home; they don't mind if you sit at the table alone and will usually bring a newspaper (The Times) to keep you occupied while you wait.The food is fabulous. I almost always have the fish of the day, but have tried most of the menu. Their burger, shepherd's pie and the corned beef hash are pure comfort food. I don't often bother with dessert, but if there are enough of us, it's always fun to get the baked alaska to have it set on fire next to the table. It's just the most lovely, relaxed, quietly perfect place!",

Not only a great waitstaff, but AMAZING food and a great environment. I got a fish and shrimp dish, my cousin got the salmon, we split a cheese plate and the clementine sponge cake for dessert.Special thanks to our waiter (can't remember his name, but he's from Southern italy) who was incredible, as well as the assistant manager.

If I were just rating the food, and if not for a couple of incidents, I would probably have given this place four stars. The food was well prepared and satisfying, in particular the corn bisque. My chicken breast entree was quite juicy, and i would recommend the sorbet and fruit dessert (very fresh).The service, however, was mediocre at best. Our waitress expected us to order food almost immediately upon sitting down, before we had even ordered drinks. Our appetizers came out fairly promptly, but our entrees were very slow to arrive. The most shocking service offense happened at the very end of the meal. My husband and I had clearly finished out dessert and tea and had gotten well beyond the point where we were ready to go, but our waitress was no where to be found. We probably sat there for a good 20-30 mins, when one of the hosts came over and told us they needed the table for other diners. Why in the world he would not have first told our waitress to bring the check, or even brought it himself, is beyond us. I thought this was a pretty unacceptable ending to what otherwise would have been a pleasant evening overall.To the staff at The Ivy: if you need your guests to be done, bring the check. It's that simple.",

Don't go here if you want the experimental cuisine, but go here if you want classic dishes made to perfection. A sirloin steak cooked just as needed, little spices, just excellent. And steak tartare prepared as it should be. According to comments around our table, the other dishes such as fish are excellent too. We did not test the starters though. Then desserts... they have a chocolate fondant which is probably the best I've ever had, if not the best. The creme brulee was very good too (not in the same league as the chocolate fondant though ;-) )As for the service: perfect service. Always a smile, efficient, showing you interest in what they're doing. So go there for an excellent dinner, with a classic touch, and perfect service.And better book, apparently it's nightmare to get a table.",

    "text": "After reading a review and getting a recommendation to dine at The Ivy we finally did and enjoyed it quite a bit. We went for lunch and tried the set menu of 3 courses. I started with the feta, watermelon and mint salad which is a personal favorite. The salad was fantastic and beautifully presented as you might imagine. The main course I tried was the Sea Bass and again I was not disappointed in the presentation, preparation or flavor. Their wine selection is nice and included a torrontes wine which we enjoyed very much. For the grand finish I had the Strawberry Royal and would recommend any of the above items. During my university years I served at a country club so I especially appreciated the servers working gracefully presenting the plate with \"The Ivy\" at the 12 o'clock position each time. These guys were smooth at resetting and attending each guest. It's the little things that make a guest experience. The furnishings are in good shape and the stained glass windows that surround the dining room are quite beautiful in the light. I found the dining room warm, intimate and it did not feel old and stodgy like I had feared it might. The clientele seemed to be a good mix of ages. I was a bit concerned about attire since one persons had written they had dined in a suit and in trainers. (hopefully not in one ensemble) LOL! Most people were dressed well and I didn't spot any trainers, even on the nearby children. This American Southerner believes eating at The Ivy won't just grow on you but leave you anticipating your next fine dining experience with them. Bon appetite, y'all!",

If you wish to make dinner reservations for a couple, I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar. Our lovely bartender, Darren, went over the (vegetarian!) menu with us and gave us advice as to which of the dishes could be veganized. He even consulted with the chef.

The table was set beautifully and the attention to detail was excellent, and staff are all so friendly.I ate from the Set Menu which changes regularly and is served Monday-Thursday 2.30pm -6pm & after 10pm also Sunday's all day.Starter - Bruschetta with stuffed olives, piquillo, avocado & Ortiz anchovies - The Bruschetta had just the right amount of softness to crunch and tasted sublime! I'm not a fan of anchovies but these were Ortiz anchovies so I had to try them which I did, but still didn't approve! But the starter was great and again the presentation was excellent! I highly applaud the chefs and kitchen staff for their presentation.Main - Rosemary lamb burger with sweet aubergine relish & sumac yoghurt - The lamb was out of this world! You know when the meat falls apart, its been cooked to perfection and WOW the sweet aubergine relish & sumac yoghurt was out of this world! And obviously I had to have a side of chips which were equally as tasty!Dessert - Chocolate fudge sundae - I am a big chocolate fudge sundae fan and this was without a shadow of doubt the best sundae I have ever had! I can't even explain the taste as its making me drawl thinking about it. You're going to have to visit The Ivy, have a sundae and let me know what you think!If you're looking for a real treat, possibly for a birthday or anniversary then book a table at The Ivy as your be wined and dined the right way. Plus take advantage of the Set Menu's and Pre Theatre Menu's which are available.",

We made reservations on a very rainy January night and arrived an hour early...we sat at the bar and had some drinks, enjoyed talking with everyone at the bar and tried some fantastic wine. When our table was finally ready, we started with the smoked salmon with horseradish cream. \u00a0I have yet to have bad smoked salmon in London, but the horseradish cream was a nice switch up. For my main I had the pork sausages with colcannon and cider gravy...best sausages ever! I'm a cider person and I wouldn't be opposed to bathing in that cider gravy. It was phenomenal. \u00a0My mother and I tried two desserts, both were excellent (unsurprisingly) but the thing I loved most was the espresso martini. I am not a martini person. Like never...But after seeing people order it at the bar, I had to try it! It was DELICIOUS. \u00a0Next time I will order it sooner, hell probably have a couple. I can't wait to return. Ivy has been added to my rotation (and I live in California, so that's saying something)!",

Everything was perfect -- the ambiance, food and service put smiles on the faces of every member of our tribe. We met a lovely couple at the adjoining table having a night out without the kids, and they seemed just as pleased.",

If I could get an IV of the sauce at the bottom of the bowl I would be a happy man. All the food was very good, the wine list was varied but a bit pricey. Over all a must visit when in London",

I enjoyed a class of full body Nappa Valley wine. Service was very attentive, the lady from Portugal was lovely, she smiled, hosted and engaged with the customers. The atmosphere was laid back, opulent and comfortable. People dressed casual smart and there was no arrogance from any of staff. They were extremely friendly. In all I had an amazing experience, delicious food, good wine and friendly service. Would definitely return.",

The location, food and decor are definitely to be sought after.We ordered the crumpet with a delicious concoction of marmite, honey and butter (as an American, this is the way to eat marmite!). The crumpet was delicious with the right amount of crunch and soft, chewy batter goodness. At the waiters recommendation we had the eggs, avocado and tomato with sesame dressing. This was absolutely amazing and I am going to attempt to recreate this at home. I definitely like this location better than LA and the over hype of the location.",

The food is bland, bland, bland and as far as I can see, the way they give it that quality feel in the mouth is by lacing it with as much butter as it's chemically possible to contain without oozing the stuff neat. The surrounds are all right and the atmosphere OK, although it's full of tourists. Why do celebrities still go there, as the indubitably do? I guess it's the same reason as they do all the other things they're supposed to do - behave badly, divorce a lot, be photographed against their will (yeah, right). Why do the food critics continue to rave about The Ivy? I wish I knew. It may be Emperor's new clothes syndrome. Or it may be they're sheep like the cee-lebs. Or (and I increasingly believe this) that they don't really like food, whcih is, after all, the British way. The Ivy is a dull restaurant and the food makes me feel sick. Think about it while you THINK you're having a great time. Does this taste of anything? Or is it mouthful after mouthful of fatty grey?",

    "text": "Definitely a restaurant to try before you die. I was surprised at how down to earth the place was when I visited despite seeing some well-known faces even on a Thursday afternoon. I loved it but who wouldn't love such a place when you have celebs nearby, fab food and you're not paying! I was lucky enough to be taken as a treat by my bosses so I may well have had a different view if I had to pay my way. Two things of note - apart from who is on the next table - is that the food is very simple fare but cooked to perfection and the service outstanding. A great way to spend an afternoon or evening. If I had to put it down for something, it would be the decor, I found it a bit old fashioned but that's just my opinion - well worth a visit and make sure you have some champers to start!",

The place feels old, in a good way, and the English comfort food warms the heart of any Northern European (people favouring refined or light food might struggle a little). I took a Californian friend and she didn't get it at all, but head there with a good honest English lass and you'll have a good old lunch or dinner. I'd even suggest you pretend to be showbiz there - by that i mean take a 2.5 hour lunch, drink a bottle of wine, and take time to savour life for a change. if you are determined to also drive to the restaurant, one of the world's most expensive parking garages is round the corner.",

That way, you get to enjoy the clean fresh flavours of all their food, and friendly service without the waiting list or the crazy booking times that everyone seems to mention. Fair enough if you want a prime time meal, but it's not that hard to get otherwise. Food is always great quality, served with decent portions and I never feel pressured to go for something that I don't want to have.",

Eclectic & extensive menu that meanders a bit - British staples (shepherds pie, devilled kidneys, fish & chips) sit alongside curries, sushi, pastas & burgers.

Admittedly, my boyfriend did propose to me in between the main course and dessert (my memory of the honeycomb ice cream is fuzzy to say the least) so I may reasonably be accused of being biased, but I am capable of criticism even under romantic circumstances. On that note - as locations for popping the question go, this was pretty spectacular. We're not a glamorous couple, so the good quality, relaxed and unobtrusive nature of the restaurant was perfect. Having taken the time to plan ahead and book months in advance is a lovely gesture and we somehow managed to get a table on a Saturday night. I was impressed from the start. The service was impeccable, the decor unassuming, clean (but not pristine or false) and ever so slightly quirky. The tables look quite close to one another when you first walk in, but once seated, you don't really notice and unless you purposefully eavesdrop, you're not really aware of other people's conversations. The food was fantastic. Refreshingly unpretentious, perfectly cooked and with ample portions. There is something to suit everyone here and my soon-to-be-fiance and I had a slightly posh version of fish and chips and bangers and mash for our mains. Ok, the fish was actually seared yellow fin tuna, but you get the idea Our starters were Eggs Benedict and Bang Bang Chicken, both of which I can highly recommend. And price wise it was pretty impressive too. Not cheap, obviously, but providing you don't have a taste for lobster or oysters you can get by with a reasonable bill at the end of the night. I believe the website includes menu prices if you want to work it out more precisely. We didn't spot any celebs though.but then we were enjoying ourselves too much to notice or care.",

From walking through the door we were provided with excellent service, dont think it would be a good idea to come here just because celebs do, as we didnt see any.

We went for lunch and therefore we sampled the more informal dishes. I has corned beef hash for example. It was priced at \u00a39.25 and I really enjoyed it. The portion was so large I had to give my boyfriend some. We treated ourselves to half a bottle of chablis, which cost \u00a317.50 - not worth it, dont bother. Sometimes I feel a bit cheapo picking the lowest priced wine but unless you are a wine conasseur you may not notice the difference as the wine is chilled to within an inch of its life and therefore could have been any old plonk and I wouldnt have noticed!! Would definately go again, but would pick cheaper wine as we didnt see the benefit of picking a posh one.",

    "text": "This is one of my favourite restaurants in London. It gets everything right. Not just the food, although you can believe the hype - it is sublime- but the ambiance, the decor, the staff, and most importantly, the way the customer is treated. From the moment the friendly doorman outside lets you in, your exceptional dining experience begins. It is a hard task for a place with so much history to be contemporary, but The Ivy easily pulls it off. Their menu takes the best of British and ever so slightly updates the dishes, adding a subtle European or Asian influence here and there. I have been here for my 21st, and then my second 21st. (otherwise known as my 30th), as well as other families birthdays. Here's the thing, it is not intimidating, it is not snooty, and you don't have to be famous in order to get a table. You don't even have to be rich - the dishes are actually not that expensive. Everyone is treated the same and given the same first rate service. Once you are seated, by way of the bar and a cocktail to start you off, you are spoilt for choice with the extensive menu. The dishes, for the most part, remain the same, but there are also monthly or seasonal additions, as well as a very comprehensive vegan and vegetarian menu. I usually go for one of the cheaper bottles of french white, and will hit the ground running on the starters with either the Bang-Bang Chicken, or Spinach, Avocado and Roquefort Salad. But I mainly come here for the much talked about Salmon Fishcake with sauteed spinach and a creamy sorrel sauce. It is simply one of the best meals that I have ever eaten. Again, it is not expensive. This meal is \u00a315.75 and I have never been able to finish it because it is so substantial and rich. My dad usually goes for the Shepherds Pie, or Ivy Hamburger, both dishes he can never finish either. Trust me, we are not a family with small appetites! If you can save room for pudding (I plan for The Ivy by starving myself for the whole day so that I can fit in 3 courses), I would go for the sticky toffee pudding. It is a shame that the Eton Mess is no longer on the menu - a concoction of smashed meringue and raspberry sauce. Still, the other puddings more than make up for its loss. I hope that whoever goes to The Ivy enjoys themselves as much as I have done when I'm there.",
