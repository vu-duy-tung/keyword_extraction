After a recent post meal painful mouth experiences at Nandos I tried the medium instead of my usual hot or even extra hot choices. It was ok, but not as nice as usual. I guess I equate pain with love as I will most certainly be back on the hot stuff next time",

I cannot believe we waited 30 minutes for food. All the plates came at different times and worst of all the waiters didn't know our table numbers. How can a busy West End restaurant not know how many tables they have or where their tables are? When the food arrived it was cold and some how two orders arrived on the wrong table. The service calamity lasted long after we had finished when a waiter asked if we were waiting for food! I didn't see the appeal of Nando's before and now I am even less inclined to use it. A joke. Avoid Nando's. Especially in Covent Garden. A joke.",

This centrally-located one offers a medium sized basement with lots of quirky booth areas for small groups and a couple of other tables on the ground floor where an additional serving area is situated. They also do lots of take away, with an average waiting time of 10mins for those who'd prefer to take back to their desk or munch in a nearby park on a summer's day. I just went for lunch now and had a particularly delectible beanie burger in a pitta with extra halloumi and it was delicious (all washed down with the South African Merlot, which, at less than \u00a34 for a 250ml glass can't be bad...). Don't forget to order a pot of the Peri-naise - the final touch on those great Nando's chips!",

It was difficult to have a conversation on the table. This might partially because of the large room which, when full, naturally provides a lot of background noise, but I also found that the background music was louder than usual. Because of its central location between Covent Garden and Trafalgar square, it gets crowded in the evening, and this can cause long queuing times for placing the order at the counter. Here too, one more employee at the counter would improve the situation considerably.",

Firstly, I don't like chains, secondly the whole place is centered around chicken - not the best sign for a veggie!However, I was invited out with old school friends and that's where they chose to meet. I quietly grumbled about having to go there and basically acted like a snob about the situation.I was proved wrong. Although I'd never recommend Nando's for an evening out, if you're after some good fast food then it's excellent. And yes they do cater for vegetarians with more than a few options offered. I went for the vegetable pattie burger with fries and was nicely surprised. I was also quite excited to sample the infamous peri peri sauce, which was delicious (I opted for medium heat, but you can choose from a scale of mild to extra hot).The place itself reminded me of the type of restaurant you find in a theme park - a theme-bar infact - \u00a0informal, bustling, and a little over-the-top. It felt a little surreal but comfortable too.So, although I won't be hurrying there, as its style isn't what I'd choose, I can now say that yes, I do like Nando's and I certainly won't complain next time the occasion beckons.",

    "text": "Nando's is a great semi-fast food restaurant in Covent Garden where you are seated and walk up to the counter to order your food. Portuguese-inspired chicken dishes include quarter, half, and whole chickens, chicken pittas, chicken wraps, and side dishes like chips, mash, peas, rice, and garlic bread. The food can be made as spicy as you would like to to be and is served with additional dipping sauces (the garlic-herb one is lovely and still quite spicy). My favorite is the chicken breast wrap with chips, with garlic-herb sauce for dipping. The service is minimal - you order at the counter then get your own drinks, silverware, and plates. Usually there is not a wait for a table, but at busy lunch or dinner times, a 5-10 minute wait is to be expected in the large restaurant. Nando's is also a good place to take a family at a reasonable price (mains are about 8 pounds or so, including side dish) as well. All in all, if you are looking for a tasty, reasonably priced lunch without too many frills or full waiter service, Nando's is a great place to try.",

I think overall Nandos tends to be a bit pricey overall, but just go for the half chicken and sides and you'll do just fine!

Having never eaten there, our first impression of the restaurant was good - customer service was on point (we were greeted, the ordering process explained clearly, and we were seated), everyone from the person who greeted us to the person who took our order to the person who brought us our food were pleasant and friendly, and we overall enjoyed the vibe (from the decor to the music). Everything was enjoyable and added to our experience. And then the food sold us on this restaurant. My husband loved his chicken thighs and sides of salad and garlic bread and I was more than satisfied with my vegetarian option of the beanie burger, which was a patty made of a mix of chickpeas and lentils...what really made the food, however, were the variety of sauces, which we enjoyed putting on EVERYTHING. They are that good. We especially enjoyed the herb sauce and the garlic sauce. All in all we are so happy we got to visit this restaurant and will miss it when we return to the states.",

During this time I studied all the various sauces that were available and came to the conclusion that all of them sounded delicious and I must try all of them.The food arrived and it tasted just as it looked - well prepared, no frills. It did the job, and I had no complaints. I couldn't really taste the original sauce used to cook the chicken, so I had to be liberal with the 5-6 sauces I had picked out to try. All in all, the chicken was juicy, not under or over cooked, and the sides were well-prepared also.There was nothing special about the meal, nothing that absolutely stood out, but that's not a bad thing. It was everything I expected, and usually I expect a decent amount from chicken - as it's hard to mess up but it's also hard to get right (if that makes sense). Nando's gets it right.",

It was the most terrible experience I have ever had at any eatery- and this is London! I know there are mice everywhere- but you don't want to dine with them. Unfortunately- this really has traumatized me and I can no longer support a corporation that has rodents/vermin infestation. The management did not seem to care- which lead me to believe this sort of stuff happens all the time. I will never dine at another Nando's again if this is the way the franchise disregards cleanliness.",

We ordered food then my partner want to wash his hands downstairs and informed me that there were loads of empty tables there - so I don't know why they had 20+ people all waiting for a table. Food arrived super quick and while the chicken pitta and wings were tasty, the portion of chips were tiny and the coleslaw was not really up to standards. It could have been better.",

I came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch and the place was packed. I got a table in 15 mins though. The waitress explained how to order and what to do. I got the chicken wrap. I liked that they had more sauces to add because I found myself add a lot of that to my wrap. I liked the fact that their chicken was grilled and not fried like you get everywhere in US. It was good food but probably not worth the hype in my opinion so I'd give it 3.5 stars.",

Although they have a vast menu and tons of vegetarian options, the food is very subpar.I split the Red Pepper Dip, and got the Portobello Mushroom and Halloumi Wrap with Avocado and Garlic bread on the side. Although the pita was soft and warm, the dip felt like a cheap taste. It was too sour compared to real hummus and the spice felt fake. The wrap was also really hard to eat. It was bland and the avocado was not great. The halloumi wasn't grilled well and the mushroom felt raw and was not that flavorful. I tried to use the hottest sauce (not even that hot) to improve the flavor of the wrap but it was not helpful. The spice again was super fake and too tangy - it seems like it's an issue for a lot of their dishes. Hate wasting food but ended up leaving a bit of the wrap. The garlic bread was very average and they don't give you a dipping sauce so had to use the spicy sauce again.Overall, payed Way too much money for a meal that I wouldn't pay more than a few pounds for.",

Upon walking in, they get your party size and have you wait a few minutes before you are seated down stairs. Once you are assigned a table number, you can go to their counter to order your food & give them your table number for where to bring the food. We ordered the sharing platter for two with lemon and herb sauce & chose the peas and super grain for our sides. All of the food we delicious and plentiful for the two of us. If you feel that your chicken needs more sauce, they have bottles of their different flavors of Peri Peri sauce. All of them were super delicious and worth trying. For dessert, we got a Naughty Nata Portuguese egg tart. They pretty much sold out for the night, so we were VERY lucky to get the last one! The only downfall I had here while on vacation was that there was no WiFi in the restaurant, so it was hard to research what was recommended to eat (not a deal breaker). When in London, go eat at Nando's!",

What should you get here?The peri-peri chicken meals! We ordered a half chicken meal in hot peri-peri marinade, along with a side of spicy rice and veggies. The chicken was tender and flavorful. We especially loved the various hot sauces and lemon garlic sauce that we slathered all over our chicken. 3. Other notes- Nando's sauce is available for purchase. - Customer service is excellent.

The chicken is what makes this casual dining chain memorable. If I was vegetarian I would be disappointed, the sides are nothing special on its own. I go to Nando's every time when I'm in the UK, the chicken wings are very good.

    "text": "i was told to go to Nando's while I was on a trip in the UK. I would say that Nando's is like Chipotle, because everyone loves them and you could probably eat at them every day and not be tired of them. One difference is that Nando's is a sit down restaurant.I came for dinner, and waiting for a table took an extremely long time. Turns out, there was another level below the ground floor. This location was massive yet still packed. This was the place to be.I recommend either ordering the 1/4 Chicken Breast or the 5 chicken wings. I always got the medium sauce, which I thought was plenty spicy.. (There is an area where you can get the other sauces if you want to try them out or realize you want more of a kick.) The sauces are fantastic. The chicken is extremely tender. For sides, I recommend the chips (my fellow Americans, that's \"fries\") and the corn on the cob. Don't waste your time with healthy sides. Definitely don't waste your time getting a salad. You're here for good food, so get the chicken.After eating here, I had Nando's about 4 more times in 1 week. Sure, there were probably other things to try in the UK (don't worry, I tried the other local cuisine), but I couldn't get enough of this chicken.Nando's, please open a location in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm begging you.",

    "text": "Nando's is a cross between a fast food chain and a more upscale restaurant - the decor definitely suggests something fancy, but order at the counter, get your own utensils, and service in general is minimal. I'd never really seen anything quite like the service model they had, so it was definitely an interesting experience.The star of the show here is definitely the chicken - it comes drenched in peri peri sauce and has quite a kick. There are also large bottles of sauce that you can grab from the utensils counter with increasing degrees of heat.The butterfly chicken and the wings were both very tender - the meat was falling off the bone and it was drenched tangy sauce. The sides come huge - I would pass on their fries or garlic bread (they were subpar and oily) and go instead for their cole slaw and their creamy mashed potatoes.The food was great but the service definitely wasn't. You order food at the counter, and our counter was just a mess. She would constantly enter things in wrong, or leave suddenly to go into the kitchen for some unknown reason. Also, this location got pretty busy during dinnertime, and the hostess was quite rude about seating people - if we tried to ask how much time was left, she simply snapped at us. There's very minimal table service, but both times our waitperson brought our food there was something wrong with it (wrong side, wrong level of spiciness, etc). I get that they were very busy, but I didn't really see how they could be busy enough to make so many mistakes. Very delicious chicken and worth trying at least once.",

    "text": "We arrived in London and knowing a lot of places close around 10:00pm (give or take), we knew we'd be safe going a bit later here as it was a Friday and they were open until 11:30pm. I had the four boneless thighs with creamy mash and garlic bread. The chicken and garlic bread were flat out amazing, like a well cooked home meal, with excellent flavor.The creamy mash was good, but lacked flavor. (I still ate 3/4 of it, as it was good, and I was extremely hungry). It should also be noted that free sauces and spices are available here and I neglected to spice anything, which was my own fault! (Lemon and herb was fresh, zesty and really complimented the chicken).The staff and setting were amazing, the staff explained in great detail how the ordering went, as our non-local accents were dead giveaways that we may be new to their restaurant. I would highly recommend Nando's to anyone wanting good food at a decent price. For the girlfriend and I, dinner was about \u00a323, they explained that no tips were expected, as get seated, then walk to the register to order/pay for your food in advance. After that, your food is delivered to your table and you can help yourself to soda, water and frozen yogurt, tap water is free.Would totally recommend to anyone.",
