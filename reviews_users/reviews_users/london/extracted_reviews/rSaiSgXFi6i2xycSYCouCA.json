    "text": "We enjoyed the 5-Course Chef's Tasting Menu (\u00a385 with accompanying wines and \u00a355 without) which was available only if all the guests at the table partake. Each course provided multiple layers of nuance, including a sweet beetroot, pickled beet shavings, ch\u00e8vre, watercress and walnut starter; sweet crab and pork sausage with a light smoked cr\u00e8me fraiche and radishes; and exquisite gnocchi (worth the trip to England) with onion squash, goat curd, sage and brown butter. The least successful was the somewhat dull in comparison short ribs (better in the croquette form) and mash. The meal came with two additional surprise inter-course treats -- crispy on the outside and unctuous on the inside short rib croquettes to start and a refreshing palette cleansing apple and thyme sorbet. The upstairs romantic and dim lighting made it a challenge to see the artfully designed and elegantly plated dishes. Our service was superb. The check was a bit less shocking thanks to prior review warnings about the charge for bread and olives - we had both. Fifteen is a definite recommendation.",

The bloody marys were great, but the service was slow and the fry ups were good, if a little generic (smaller portions than, say, the Breakfast Club and much less interesting good). Here's the thing we didn't like -- food seemed to come out in no apparent order and we were left waiting about 40 minutes for 2 sausage butties while other tables were served before us. I mean it was quiet in there, I never cook, but even I know it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to fry some bloody sausages. Great building, nice atmosphere and decor, but slow and haphazard service.",

    "text": "After having a quick drink at the Eagle just down the block (inspiration for the \"in and out the Eagle\" line in Pop Goes the Weasel... I like to hum this maniacally whenever I walk by) we headed to Fifteen for a 9:15 reservation last Friday. We were promptly seated at a two-top in the middle of the restaurant, and menus came shortly after. I was pleased to see oysters on the list of starters but less pleased to hear that the chef had taken this off the menu. I settled on the burrata to start, which was fine, and my Hot Date had the crab, which was generous and tender but a little on the salty side. If I were to go again I might skip starters, as the mains were fairly large and far better. I had a roasted mallard with a side of grilled cabbage; I was surprised that the cabbage was the real star here, buttery and full of brassica flavor. The mallard was also excellent and perfectly cooked. Hot Date has pork belly, which I was less a fan of since I dislike pork but seemed to be nice. For sides we had broccolini (okay), duck fat potatoes (would not recommend) and mashed potatoes (wish I had a bucket full). No matter how full you are, dessert should not be skipped; our custard tart's runnier-than-average consistency made it a bit difficult to eat but was not too sweet and melted in my mouth. Would definitely go again!",

    "text": "I don't know any other way to start this other than saying straight away that this was the best meal and dining experience I have ever had. Jaimie Oliver has been one of my favorite chefs for a long time. I love watching his show where he sits in his homey kitchen cooking up fresh creative food for his friends, neighbors, local tradesmen, family, or anyone else who he wants to feed. When I had heard about Fifteen, I was instantly desiring to go. Considering I was working as an intern at an insurance company and studying at the same time, i wasn't necessarily minted... but I had decided I was going to go anyway. But even before I worked that up, I was surprised by a trip there with my best friend and his mom. The moment you pull up to the converted warehouse you are swept away from the busy streets of London into a food paradise. I was lucky enough that we got seats for the tasting menu. We were greeted by a Jaimie Oliver lookalike who walked us through the entire meal. When I say he walked us through, I literally mean that for every course, every ingredient, every wine pairing, he explained the reason why they were at a certain point during the meal, why they were prepared together, and how they were prepared. For someone who loves cooking, this was fascinating. After we completed our tasting menu meal, I was a bit disappointed that it was over. This is the perfect melding of great food, great ambiance, great service, and a great cause.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago my friends and I had a very posh night out in Fifteen's 'dining room' and even though it cost a fortune, it was absolutely worth it! Oddly, the dining room is in the basement of Fifteen and so doesn't benefit from any natural light. To counter this the designers have painted the whole room white with only a few darker features. Maybe this was a smart idea but it's not really worked in practice and as you walk in you can't help but feel like you're in an advert for Domestos. Putting these thoughts aside we decided to go for the four course 'tasting menu' with its selection of salads, pasta's, main courses and desserts. My favourite of all the courses was definitely the Wild Mushroom and Truffle risotto, it was so earthy and rich. It was probably the best risotto I've ever had in my life and I wish I could eat it again. My friends 'Wicked' (it really does say that on the menu) Fisherman's Stew was also lovely and arrived with a giant langoustine perched proudly on the top. He loved this touch and set quickly about decapitating the poor thing. Throughout the evening the staff were wonderful, very helpful and chatty. I really felt like they made the night that bit more fun for us all. People have complained about the prices in Fifteen and yes, at \u00a360 a head I won't be eating the tasting menu every week, but I think it's easily forgotten that this is a charity and that all the money made is being put back in to help more youngsters. If you keep this idea at the forefront of your mind the prices start to make a bit more sense and pale into insignificance next to some of the other celebrity restaurant's in London. For those looking for a more informal Fifteen experience the trattoria upstairs is the perfect alternative and makes a great breakfast if you're ever in the area before midday. All round I think this restaurant is brilliant and would recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I found this restaurant profoundly underwhelming. \u00a0I am willing to believe that my NYC restaurant experience and year living in London has left me a bit spoiled in the gastronomy department, but I thought this place was pretty generic considering that it's Jamie Oliver's famous pet-project.We arrived at the restaurant 15 min early, as had been requested of us, and were led through a wood-paneled cafeteria-like setting to a cafe table. \u00a0As the host stepped away from the table, the whole table shook on the loose wood floor - as it did every time a server or bartender trotted past. \u00a0The place was noisy in the obnoxious way, not in the \"busy Friday night\" way - with a group of out-of-towners shouting and taking pictures an arms-length from our table. \u00a0The server came around and asked us about drinks, about 1 min after we sat down. \u00a0We hadn't even gone through the menu yet, and being somewhat of a wine aficionado, I tend not to select wine until I know what I am eating. \u00a0I didn't realize that sending this server away meant not getting his attention again for another 20 min, by which time my boyfriend and I were both long-since ready to order dinner and get on with it. \u00a0The bread was very nice, the seafood risotto was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Sandy's pasta was good, but not exceptional - not something I could not have made at home. \u00a0We both ordered the pork loin, when they told us they only had one and would be giving one of us another cut of pork. \u00a0I offered to choose something else, but the server insisted that it wouldn't make a difference. \u00a0A while later (not a long wait), the food arrived - a HUGE chunk of loin pinwheeled with a pesto like substance on top of a bed of red wine caramelized red peppers and onions, with some spinach. \u00a0Pork tenderloin is something that is rarely very fatty, but usually quite tender and hard to do poorly. \u00a0This pinwheel of meat looked like bacon, with a huge amount of pure fat (with no meat marbleized in) along all the edges -- about half of the total volume. \u00a0The veg was well-done, but it was that sort of taste that gets tired on the palate after a short time. \u00a0Sandy had a less fatty cut, but agreed there was something bitter and a bit off with the seasoning, and also got tired of the veg. \u00a0By the time dessert was being considered, I was ready to go. \u00a0I don't have a good idea of how the price was for the value.I am not sure how much of this was potentially one rowdy group near us, but I think some of it is how the space of the restaurant is built. \u00a0I go to nice restaurants expecting the complete experience, relaxing, inviting, warm, good food, good wine. \u00a0This place has a really impersonal, cafeteria-like hustle and bustle, with no way to limit the sound and give intimate surroundings to individual parties. \u00a0I left feeling tired (not full-up tired, but stress tired). \u00a0I would recommend this place for lunch - a nice business lunch or lunch meeting with friends, but I would not recommend it for dinner, especially not one where you want ambiance. \u00a0The food is okay, with a few shining moments (seafood risotto really was very good), but overall not above the quality I could whip up in my London \"kitchen\" (a.k.a. two hobs and a microwave). \u00a0If you go in expecting a culinary school, they're doing well. \u00a0If you go in expecting a fine dining experience, I think you'll be disappointed. \u00a0We went in August, when the students are just about to graduate, so I really thought this was Fifteen at its best. \u00a0They even mentioned that on the menu. \u00a0I would not come here in September when the students are new.As a final positive note, I was served a delicious Spanish chardonnay with a beautiful full fruit apricot finish that was sensational with both my seafood and pork dishes. \u00a0While I have had some strong negative words about this place, I want to be clear that it is not *that* bad. \u00a0I had a wonderful night out with my loving boyfriend. \u00a0My reaction comes from the expectations I had for this place, and its underwhelming delivery. \u00a0There is an air in this restaurant that they're riding on Mr. Oliver's reputation and not on an objective valuation of the food (a bit like how Hard Rock Cafe is really not about the mac and cheese. It will always be about the rock memorabilia, no matter how bad the food is - or how good the mac and cheese is). \u00a0As much as I love the naked chef, this food was marginal, and I credit him as a great deal stronger culinary prowess than that.",

Up there in the cooking world with the likes of Bourdain and Mark Bittman he makes naked food great. There was nothing I had here that wasn't cooked perfectly. From the aubergine (eggplant) ravioli, to sea bass, to marscapone, it was all superb, fresh, and amazingly light. \u00a0I went in with high expectations, and came out impressed. A feat to be as good bite as bark. The only downsides I can think of is that the maitre-die runs you around a bit if you call, in a way un-characteristic of what I think of when I think Jamie. Other than that, you can literally have a perfectly cooked anything balancing flavors in a way that would make Philippe Petit proud.",

After quite a while I was given the food menu. This starts at \u00a34 for bread and chicken butter and goes up to \u00a328 for lamb etc. No mention of starters or mains so you have to ask!Told the top ones can be starters and the expensive ones mains or I think you can have any as either. So you start off confused so you will have trouble making the right decision so you may not enjoy your meal because of it. The waiter said it was a sharing menu whichdidnt help as I was on my own. I decided on potato in cheese with pickled onions and taragon for what I thought was a strange starter and lamb for main. After an age they arrived together which was probably agood thing as potato for starter would be strange. I dont think there were starters I didnt understand it at all so would perhaps not go again. You dont want a lottery do you?Potato dish was delicious the lamb also. Unfortunately by this time I had drunk half a bottle of wine and a half bottle of water.Dessert was another menu and I had a prune thing with chantilly cream which was excellent.By the time I had drunk abottle of wine mixed taragon and onions and chantilly cream I thought it was best not to have coffee or whiskey and left. Cost \u00a380.I wish I hadnt had the wine it was quite acidy and the mix of this and the food has given me wind and my stomach has churned like a dishwasher all night. This fancy food is a challenge to your digestive system!So the food is good stay off the macon village and dont be in ahurry.Food is excellent and service friendly. Restaurant is cosy. They put your wine in ice away from you so you need awaiter to top up your glass of wine. They do this to save space its annoying. They top up your water to..

I called ahead to see if there was availability in the Trattoria, and went for an early Monday lunch before the busy hours.Service was OK, not overly friendly at the time. The gnocchi recipe is on the wall, and they had cards with the recipe (that nobody told me about). Nice dark decor, dimly lit and cozy. You get balsamic vinegar and bread (again, this was 3 years ago). I had the gnocchi with oxtail ragu for an appetizer and duck confit for the entree. The latter was OK, perhaps only because it followed the magic that was...The gnocchi. Just... It's so... I'm drooling from the memories. They should make it into a full-size entree if they haven't already. Tender potato pasta, not at all gooey, rich oxtail sauce with well-developed flavors without being heavy.The next time I see it I'll probably go into a trance and make a beeline. It is a destination food. I may have to plan a trip to London for it.",

If we were starving and impatient it wouldnt have been though. The bar area near the door was practically too crowded to get a drink anyway.Service was bad - we had to hail a random waitress everytime we wanted to order - wine, starters. mains etc.Starter - octopus and bruschetta was delicious, venison as a main was delicious, and the (very expensive - \u00a354 wine ) was good.But the prices were too high for the quality - \u00a325 a main.The service was just inconsistent and bad. One we got someone's attention it was great, but very inconsistent. I had to order as soon as the waiter gave us our menus as i was worried they'd dissapear into a black hole again and never re-appear.The desert (chocolate brownie) was stone cold, not great..Glad we tried it but wouldn't go back.jamie's Italian in Angel is soo much better and cheapr, and a proper dining experience, and the food is better.",

    "text": "I would love to take out the long knives and attack a celebrity chef, but Jamie Oliver's beliefs and expertise are on excellent display at Fifteen. In order to keep the tab under control, my wife and I shared four appetizer-sized dishes: the best beef carpaccio I've ever tasted and three pastas. It was a perfect amount of food and kept the bill manageable.That carpaccio: generous curls of divine Parmasan, cold Roman-style artichoke and aged Balsamic were perfect accents to the thin-sliced beef. The pastas, all made fresh in house: a light and flavorful vegetable ravioli in brown butter, a nice but unexceptional seafood linguine with in-the-shell mussels and a beautifully nuanced ragu over bowtie. Service was a bit spotty - our main server was clearly annoyed that we ordered the carpaccio while still mulling the menu, and he disappeared for long stretches. The others were friendlier and more attentive. As tourists from Miami, it's hard for me to judge how pricey Fifteen was relative to similar restaurants, but it wasn't the kind of sticker shock we'd been told to expect of London. All in all a very satisfying dinner that showcases Jamie Oliver's commitment to great ingredients, fresh flavors and simple preparations.",

By definition, we were poor and constantly on the go, so, just couldn't make it all the way out to what seemed to be the outskirts of London. This time around, I made a point to squeeze in a visit to this place in my itinerary. Even made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. So you can see how disappointed I was to experience such mediocrity. I went here for brunch, and had the Full Monty breakfast. The grilled mushrooms and tomatoes were quite good; however, the poached egg was dry and rubbery, bacon was too salty, bread was bland. The ambiance of the place was simple, modern and rustic at the same time. But what bothered me was people in chef coats constantly walking in and out of the dining area without a clear reason. Also, at one point of our meal, someone brought out the vacuum cleaner to the dining area. All in all, this place seemed quite disorganized.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to go to Jamie Oliver's Fifteen during my visit to London. Sadly, in the end, it was disappointing. We were seated at a nice table downstairs with a great view of the kitchen. I like the charity efforts here where they give young people a break into the restaurant business. That's pretty cool. The menu looked good and we started out with the Beautiful burrata with Isle of Wight tomatoes, marjoram, mixed leaves and aged balsamic and Freshly picked Devonshire crab, on toasted sourdough, with lentils di Castelluccio and brown crab meat dressing. We preferred the crab of the two. We were informed that they were out of the scallops, which my wife had her heart set on, and this is where our troubles began. The only other options she was considering were fish, which would be tough as they are not usually filleted. The waiter tried to help my wife find something that would work, but we always ended up with the bone problem. So, he said that he could do the special with the mullet, which would not have any bones. Of course when this hits the table, it's a few whole fish. Wife's not happy and doesn't touch it. My pappardelle with ragu is just sitting there steaming like her. Waiter nowhere to be found, left us waiting. By the time the manager showed up, I was pretty much done. My wife explained how she asked about the bones and this was not what she wanted. It was moot at this point. We'll just move on to dessert. We got two, the Salted caramel and chocolate tart with creme fraiche ice cream and the Tiramisu semifreddo with Amedei chocolate mousse. They were both quite good. I found it odd that the waiter mentioned he would comp my wife's dessert and not remove her main, which was the most expensive thing on the menu. Sure enough, it was there when the bill arrived. I had a quick chat with the manager and she removed it. I never do anything like that. But, I'm a man of principal. We'll gladly pay our way. It would seem appropriate to comp the dish she was steered to and never touched. Kind of an off night, and we expected more.",

The inside of the building is neat and my waiter was very helpful. I started with the bread dish was only so-so, but what really be expected from bread? My suggestion though would be to skip the bread and go with a desert at the end. First dish was the Tagliatelle with pork which was excellent. Check out the picture to see. Finished with the steak which wasn't the best steak I've had but was very good nonetheless. It had an interesting sauce on top which was a little overpowering, but I still enjoyed the steak. Overall great meal and I would suggest trying this place.",

As such, I'll take some time and write a longer review than I usually do. \u00a0Though, I can't believe I'm the first-- I get this feeling that I missed this restaurant in the Yelp search results.Firstly, the restaurant is divided into 2 sections-- downstairs and ground level. \u00a0I don't know if there are 2 different kitchens, but I would suspect so as they have different menus. \u00a0With that in mind, this review is for the ground level \"Trattoria\" section of the restaurant and not the downstairs \"Dining Room\".Secondly, this is a Jamie Oliver restaurant. \u00a0In fact, I think it is one of his earlier (if not first) ones. \u00a0For those who have been living under a rock for the last decade, Jamie Oliver is a British celebrity TV chef. \u00a0At this point, I would like to disclose the fact that I am a huge Jamie Oliver fan. \u00a0He just seems like a great guy. \u00a0Check out his hidden talent: youtube.com/watch?v=xV_8\u2026So what is the restaurant like? \u00a0In a word \"AWESOME\".The food was wonderful especially the bread. \u00a0His \"softest gnocchi in the world\" starter, for example, truly is pillow-like soft! \u00a0Surprisingly, the dishes are huge. \u00a0Seriously, the serving size is just massive. \u00a0So expect to bin half your plate if you want to get to dessert.The service was excellent. \u00a0We were famished, so I remember calling over the wait staff to enquire about our starters. \u00a0Shortly after the wait staff left, the maitre d' came over and apologised for our 17mins wait. \u00a0Apparently, they have an internal rule of a 15mins (or something) maximum wait time for starters. \u00a0He also offered dessert on the house. \u00a0Of course, the starters came literally 30 seconds after the maitre d' left our table.ps: Since, we were pressed for time and had to catch a bus out-of-town, I called for the bill, and we didn't order dessert. \u00a0The maitre d' actually noticed that we didn't take advantage of the free dessert offer. \u00a0So he came over to talk to us about our experience. \u00a0I explained that we were quite happy but just pressed for time. \u00a0Before I knew it, the maitre d' arranged for a hand-packed, brown, paper bag full of savoury brownies from the kitchen. \u00a0Thanks, Trattoria!",

    "text": "One of the reasons Jamie Oliver started this restaurant was to give troubled young people an opportunity to overcome their problems and prepare for a career in the restaurant industry. This lofty goal, paired with outstanding cuisine, warrants the trek it takes to get here from central London. (It took us two trains and about 40 minutes from the Leicester Square tube station.)Be advised that the dining room offers only a tasting menu, priced at \u00a360 per person, in the evening. We knew we were in for a treat the moment we tasted the warm rosemary focaccia, accompanied by zesty olives and thin slices of salami, that was brought to the table the moment we were seated. We started with very creamy buffalo mozzarella and sweet, juicy peaches in a mint-flavored balsamic dressing and a salad of melon and paper-thin slices of slightly salty prosciutto. For our next course we had pappardelle in a hearty lamb sauce and a seafood risotto with a hint of fennel. For our entrees we selected roast lamb with smashed cannellini beans and sauteed spinach and pan-fried duck breast in a red wine and cherry sauce served with squash and swiss chard.For dessert we opted for roast apricots and strawberries with an amaretto-pistachio semifreddo and espresso and rum panna cotta drizzled with chocolate sauce and served with amaretto biscuits.Everything was absolutely exquisite, and we savored each and every morsel we tasted. This was one of the finest meals we have eaten anywhere in the world.We returned a few days later for the three-course lunch priced at \u00a0\u00a325, which is a terrific bargain since it is just slightly more than the cost of an entree alone on the a la carte menu. Although we haven't had a chance to eat in the trattoria, the menu looks promising and we plan to try it the next time we're in town.Do yourself and the deserving staff a big favor and treat yourself to a meal in this superb restaurant.",

Truth be told, I didn't really know who Jamie Oliver even was before I came here. I just figured it was a cool looking restaurant with a funny looking pink logo. The first time I was there, I really was't knocked off my feet. At least, not in the way I expected to be when going to a famous chef's restaurant. It was decent service, a very nice setting, and super close to my place.I definitely wanted to give it another shot, someone had explained to me that Jamie Oliver's whole thing is really good quality ingredients. So, I went with that in mind. I wasn't expecting super fancy...I was expecting simple food done very well. I'll tell ya what...that's exactly what I got.At this point, I've had upstairs and downstairs. The tasting menu downstairs really is awesome. Definitely go for the wine pairing there. If you're eating upstairs, don't expect some sort of Gordon Ramsay style artwork you can eat. Expect an excellent version of something you've likely had a few times before. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. :-P",

We sat in the upstairs Trattoria and shared the antipasti to start comprising a selection of olives, Italian cured meats, cheeses and vegetables served on rustic wooden blocks. As a main I enjoyed the roasted spatchcock poussin and then for dessert the white chocolate and hazelnut cheesecake. Yum, yum, yum. The portions were incredibly hearty - rare for such an establishment - the waiting staff friendly, knowledgable and downright charismatic and the atmosphere so relaxed you'd be forgiven for thinking you were in one of Italy's trattorias itself.Next time I visit Fifteen I'm going to hit the glorious looking cocktail bar or go for brunch. Pastries start at around \u00a32, breakfast sarnies at \u00a34.50 and a full on fry-up comes in at just under a tenner. And any reticence about shelling out for breakfast at Oliver's restaurant when you could just go to your local greasy spoon should be quelled by the fact that Fifteen is a charity so any gluttony is in fact an act of altruism.",

    "text": "If there's a building that can look like a stereotypical English phone booth, this is that building. \u00a0The uniqueness of the design is matched by its mission: \u00a0Founder and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver trains 15 disadvantaged and at-risk young adults every year to work in the restaurant business, and at the end of training places them either w/i his restaurants or finds places for them through his network. \u00a0The Fifteen Network is completely non-profit and was started in 2000 when Oliver put his house up as collateral without telling his wife. \u00a0Mancrush. If you're not familiar with Hoxley and are taking the tube you'll have to have a map; \u00a0it's a little of a walk from the nearest tube station, about a mile although we turned it closer to two miles since we got lost. \u00a0 When you finally find the restaurant and walk in you're greeted by several servers in the Trattoria. \u00a0We chose to eat our lunch downstairs in the Dining Room, which had cheaper prices in exchange for a more rustic and limited menu. \u00a0I was surprised to see the dining room decorated in such a modern fashion when compared to the quaint traditional Italian setting of the Trattoria on the ground floor. \u00a0For lunch, we had an option: \u00a02 courses for 22 pounds or 3 courses for 25. \u00a0Seemed like a no-brainer to me, I chose the 3 courses. \u00a0Before we ordered the server brought out bread and a vinaigrette. \u00a0The bread was very simple, very light, and very fresh. \u00a0The rosemary and salt sprinkled across the top was perfect. \u00a0For the three courses I chose a first entree, a second entree, and a dessert.First Entree, Tagliatelle Welsh Lamb RaguFirst thing I noticed when it arrived was how big the plate itself was, and how much smaller it made the portion look. \u00a0The pasta was amazing- bouncy. \u00a0I suspect it's hand-made by the restaurant. \u00a0The sauce was a complex combination of so many things-basil, sugar, tomatoes, lamb, carrots, onions, garlic... you could taste each ingredient. \u00a0The lamb itself was so tender it almost melted in my mouth like a fatty brisket. \u00a0DeliciousSecond Entree, Leg of Pork on PolentaAs good as the ragu was, the roast pork was better. \u00a0It came out on the same sized plate as the ragu but this portion was bigger. \u00a0The generous slice of pork sat on a large bed of mushroom polenta, topped with a garnish of herbs. The pork was cooked to medium rare (it's ok to eat pork less than well done!) and intensely succulent. \u00a0The juice ran down and combined with the polenta as i cut into the pork yet the bite of meat was still good. \u00a0The flavor of the pork reminded me of a steak- not that it tasted like beef, but rather the taste was so full and so rich: \u00a0if I may describe it as a symphony you would be able to hear the lows resonate and the highs sing to create a very round sound. \u00a0The polenta was lusciously creamy and the mushrooms so fresh they were the first thing I smelled when the server set the plate down. Dessert, Panna CottaThe panna cotta came out on a plate with raspberries, pear slices, and some sort of fruit biscuit. \u00a0The panna cotta itself was good- not overdone with vanilla as some places do, but smooth enough to complement the fruits while still retaining its own character. \u00a0Great way to finish off the meal.If you know anything about Jamie Oliver you'll know three things: \u00a01.) he cooks with fresh ingredients. \u00a0as far as i'm concerned he's the first one that emphasized fresh and local, way back in the late 90s. \u00a02.) he cares about social injustice and always does as much as he can to improve those situations which appear helpless3.) he can cook. \u00a0really well.The lunch confirmed #s 1 and 3, and the success of the restaurant confirmed point #2. \u00a0This is one of my favorite meals I've ever had, not only for the great food but also because of the mission Jamie has decided to undertake. \u00a0Good food, good people, great success.",

This is one of the only places we made a reservation for in advance of our trip to London and left disappointed.We were excited as we approached the beautiful building itself, but as we walked to our table, we were a party of five sat at a table for four. This probably would have been fine except London was in the middle of a heat wave and we were told the air conditioning was broken. As we sat sweating, we asked for ice in the pitcher of water and it came back with less ice than my son's soft drink.There were many chances for our waiter to redeem our experience through outstanding service, but this did not happen. He seemed impatient and put off that we needed help interpreting the menu and suggested we order more food, which turned out to be way too much. We are foodies from San Francisco, and my wife is a chef, and the menu just seemed to be too fussy. I wonder what Jamie's kids would order if they came to eat there? All of us, who are exposed to a wide variety of different foods. were uncertain what to order based on reading the menu.The food itself was good, but not outstanding. The roasted chicken for two comes as a whole roasted chicken that you have to carve yourself at the table. For \u00a335, I would have expected the chicken to come pre-carved and be perfectly cooked, not dry.In summary, our experience didn't match what we've come to know as Jamie's style and philosophy. We had dinner a few nights before at Jamie's Recipease in Notting Hill, which was fantastic and less than half the price.If are in London, or are a Jamie Oliver fan, I would skip Fifteen.",

Me and my friend arrived there after a long day walking through London and therefore we decided not to especially dress up or anything to go there. We were really hungry and exhausted when we got there and just needed a proper meal. Anyways, arriving there, the whole restaurant was pretty empty. Though they sat us in the very last corner (booth next to toilets) downstairs, bacause we probably were not the clientele they'd like to show through their windows and entrance. We are no It-Girls or anything and we felt actually really weird and uncomfortable about our dark seating area. Additionally, you can feel that they are in a hurry to serve you to get your table again which is really annoying. The portions were T.I.N.Y. (Jamie Oliver - aaah what?? When did that happen?) and way too overpriced. I mean I get that modern cuisine and high quality products have a price, but I remember a Fifteen with a relaxed service and proper portions where quantity and quality have a balance. So this was probably my last time enjoying food there. I just felt stressed and out of place to be honest.",

The prior reviews for Jamie Oliver's Fifteen caught my attention, both for the food quality and the non-profit cause of the restaurant. Fifteen did not disappoint. The hostess staff was friendly and welcoming, our server was knowledgable and personable, and the food was fantastic (including one of the best chocolate mousse desserts I've ever had). For as good as the food (burrata, house smoked ham, lamb, short rib, carrot cake, chocolate mousse), drinks (nice wine options), and ambiance (open design dining room with good lighting and view into the kitchen) was, it was also a good value. Highly recommended for a nice dinner in central London. Well done Jamie Oliver and staff of Fifteen.",

Our dishes were universally under seasoned, and in the instance of our side of green beans, so overcooked we had to send them back. I remain shocked at the blandness of my pasta which is a dish based on eggs, cheese, guanciale and black pepper. It takes some kind of skill to make those ingredients into something so flavourless.The best bit was the bread. We actually ordered it, as opposed to the olives which showed up unasked for (and with a charge.) I hate olives but concede that these very clean tasting green ones made me rethink my stance.Attempting to end the meal on a positive note, I ordered the brownie. Its biscotti-like crunchiness left me wondering if it had simply been left sitting out too long (like a week, perhaps?)Fifteen's space possesses a nice vibe and I can definitely appreciate the social good it's attempting to do by training young chefs. However, I think I'll stick to watching Jamie Oliver on telly rather than paying the hefty tariff to dine on this poorly executed food.",

Great if you are a human being who likes nice people, if you are a snob then best to go elsewhere. Jamie Oliver's other restaurants can difffer wildly from terrible to good and food poisoning is not \u00a0unknown. \u00a0This is because he leaves them to their own devices abd does not manage them properly.However this restaurant is a charity and his office is around the corner, he is there about every week and the excellent results can be seen. A great recommendation for a nice and quite unique experience.The 2-3 star Saturday evening:When arrived 3 people at the front who were struggling to know what they were doing, greeted us by being self important and looking down their noses at us; while they struggled to cope.There was a delay because their oven had broken so they had to move things to a different oven etc. which is totally excusable.However my main course meat partridge was rare beneath the skin and this is not excusable. If I had not noticed and plucked up the courage to say it could have been serious hospitalisation or death!This was greated by them being defensive, although admittedly I was not at my best because I realised how serious this could be and was scarred and shaken by it. \u00a0Once I showed them how I do Yelp reviews, they were a bit softer and more sincerely apologetic. At the end they offered to do the meal for free. \u00a0However as is a charity we agreed my bill would go in full direct to the charity. \u00a0It was not the waiter's fault and he was good, so I gave him a full tip.They could not cope, did not know enough what they were doing and if this happened so easily, I cannot imagine what other dangers await.Great for Monday to Thursday, best avoided Friday and Saturday's. \u00a0However the fame of Jamie Oliver means the restaurant will be fine.",

    "text": "We just got back a few hrs ago from Jamie Oliver's Fifteen. Quite a good experience and a delightful menu, which had primarily Italian influences.We ordered a bunch of things for the table and split everything. We started with a few apps, char-grilled eggplant with mint and jalapeno and also fresh peaches and pecorino cheese. The eggplant was cooked to perfection and the char taste was outstanding. The mint and jalepeno was a great touch too. The peaches and pecorino was a bit on the disappointing side. Not a lot to it, the cheese was lost in the mealiness of the peach, and the taste was far too subdued to be interesting.For our main dish, we got a very light sweet potato gnocchi with ricotta and also a roast squash, tomato, spinach and ricotta casserole. The mains were brilliant. I never get gnocchi, as they are usually too heavy. But this was advertised as being \"the lightest\", so I couldnt resist. It was amazing. Beautiful taste and a very delicate texture. The squash was also on the money, a gorgeous combination of flavors, though, it seemed to lack a bit of saltiness. Perhaps an oversight by the chef.Finally for dessert we had a peach and almond frangipane cake as well as a blue cheese plate with dried dates and also a chutney. Gorgeous stuff...and better yet, the place is entirely not for profit. Very impressive lad that Jamie Oliver!One downside is the location. Coming from central London it was in the middle of nowhere on the north end. Other than that, recommended!",

My friend and I made it our last act on our 5 day London trip to have dinner at Jamie Oliver's Fifteen and what a way to cap off a great trip!We walked in and were immediately greeted, the staff was having a meeting and we were just there to make a reservation. They were very helpful and were able to get us a table at 6pm, but that they would need the table at 8pm for a party who made their reservation in advance. This was fine with us, we were just happy to be given a table after walking in 2 hrs before the dinner rush. To start we ordered the bread and antipasti. The bread was a bottomless assortment, much like you would receive anywhere else, however this bread was different. If you got there early enough you could buy the bread and take it to go, I want to say it was like \"Pablo's bread,\" something like that. Anyway it was excellent! The antipasti consisted of olives, mortadella, buffalo mozzarella, salami, and toast with pesto. The mortadella was some of the best I've ever had, and the Italians in my family make a point to always find the best mortadella in the Bay Area for antipasti on Thanksgiving (our Thanksgiving is a messed up American/Mexican/Italian hodgepodge). And you can never go wrong with buffalo mozzarella!I had the rib-eye, which was bone out...but amazing! I was a little discouraged when it showed up to the table bone out but my frown was quickly turned upside-down. One of the best steaks I've ever had, and in London of all places! The rib-eye is pictured as \"steak,\" thanks Adam B. My dinner, 5 stars.My friend had the seafood pasta, that's what she gets every where we go :0 and she loved it. I did try a bite or two and it was really good. We both loved our food and will each return whenever we are in London. I will also send all my friends and family here.",

    "text": "I don't hate Jamie Oliver so this is not an attack on him and all he stands for. In fact I quite like following the recipes that I find online. However, I recently had such a below-par experience at this restaurant that I think it is only fair that I shared it.First of all, I was told I could only get an 8.15 reservation on a Thursday night for 3 people but we showed up at 8 and at least half of the upstairs was empty and more than half of downstairs was empty. There did seem to be quite a big crowd downstairs but nothing more than most experienced restaurants can handle (I used to work as a waitress myself, so I'm normally very forgiving).Despite the empty restaurant, they did not offer to seat us until we had already ordered drinks at the bar, which seemed a bit deliberate in my opinion. The waiter was attempting be a charming Italian but in fact was focusing so hard on being charming that he didn't stop to listen to a word we said and sounded like he was just reading off a script, which ruined the overall impact of what he was trying to achieve.Full disclosure at this point - I suffer from a medical condition that sometimes makes it difficult to eat and means I might have to run to the bathroom a lot if I'm feeling unwell. I happen to go to the restaurant on a day that I was feeling particularly unwell so that did not help matters. What made it worse is that on the first occasion that I ran to the bathroom 2 out of the 3 women's cubicles were out of toilet paper (and there was a person, understandably, in the third). There was not a spare bit of toilet paper in sight. I found that so baffling because the restaurant was not busy enough to warrant running out of toilet paper unexpectedly. So it could only indicate that the staff did not properly check the bathrooms at least every hour, which is standard in most restaurants these days. Not only was that offputting according to the usual standards of most customers - for a customer with my particular needs it was actually pretty distressing. On top of the general poor service, the food was only mediocre and the general consensus of everyone was that all of our dishes were served a bit cold This could have to do with the large party downstairs but again, that party was not of the size that was unmanageable. If the food had lived up at all to what it promised, I would have forgiven the other circumstances but it didn't. It was incredibly overpriced for the standard that was delivered.I will be avoiding the restaurant at all costs in the future and intend to make a formal complaint about the poor level of service.",

It was my choice to dine here and because of celiac disease, he was initially a little reluctant because of the cuisine type as Italian restaurants are notorously difficult for those who must eat gluten-free. What a pleasant surprise! The best dish of the evening was his gorgeous - and huge! - antipasto platter (see my pic) while I adored the pillowy soft gnocchi with a well balanced tomato sauce as my starter. In a pure piglet move on my part, I also indulged in spaghetti (albeit a half portion) for my main and it was spicy and flavorful. So good!!Service was polished, professional and very knowledgeable, adding to the enjoyment of the meal.",

I thought the food was mediocre and the service was not worthy of 12.5 % service charge. As a group, we had the salami and cheese selection for the starter which was nicely presented. However, I found the carbonara i ordered to be more than al dente and unextraordinary at all. I could easily make a better sauce than what I had there. In addition, two other friends had the ravioli which they both did not feel worth raving about. Though Fifteen offers generous portion, it does not compensate for the expensive and ordinary food they serve. The service we noticed was unfriendly and lacking communication with each other. The staff brought our bread late and when they finally arrived two server brought it one after another. The only time they came really quick was when they we ask for our bill.Enough said, this place needs more staff who are less pretentious and friendly as well as more chef-ing from Jamie Oliver himself.",

The location isn't the most obvious, but the cozy atmosphere makes up for it. I ate here last night with two friends and was pleasantly impressed. The staff was very friendly, there was no wait for a table, yet the place had a buzzy vibe to it.The green olives to start were beeeeyooootiful! Bright green, huge and succulent. The red wine we choose, which was just the house special, was delicious. And the gnocchi was light and airy. The prices weren't too bad for a Jamie Oliver restaurant- it probably helps that this one is a charitable organization. I would recommend it for a night out with friends, for drinks, a date or even a large group if you book ahead of time.",

    "text": "Our experience was death by 1000 paper cuts: the food was good (not amazing but good), the service left much to be desired. Do not wear dark pants if you are not prepared to have white lint on them. I discovered this when I asked for a black napkin (twice) and was brought cocktail napkins without explanation. Everything seemed to take three times longer than necessary, and the restaurant was only half full with servers standing around. The staff seemed very confused that we did not want a huge meal but only small plates and dessert. It took an hour to have our water refilled. My Tokaji came in a very sticky glass (the entire stem and base). None of these alone was a problem, but they added up to substandard service.The food was tasty but didn't blow up our skirts. We didn't find the food to be overpriced, as others have. the charred cauliflower and the mushroom raviolo were very good. The sea trout and beetroot were fine. the chocolate ganache and the tarragon cake were both overpowered by their ice creams.Overall, we had a pleasant meal, but it is not what we expected from the Jamie Oliver brand based on experiences at his other restaurants. Worth trying if you're really interested, but keep your expectations in check. The mission of the restaurant is really spectacular, and I hope they are able to raise their current standard to allow rising chefs to train in a superior environment.",

    "text": "As a final treat in London prior to our departure back towards Montreal, we made a reservation at one of Jamie Oliver's restaurant, Fifteen. Located in central London, Fifteen's claim to fame is their \"non-profit\" status. All profits from the restaurant go to the Jamie Oliver Food Foundation. On top of that, the restaurant has an apprentice programme which provides challenged youth with training and mentorship in the food industry. A very cool and worthwhile project within a high-end restaurant.Located on a weird, almost dead-end street that is very easy to miss, Fifteen is a beautiful space. The main floor has a nice bar and lounge space which was quite busy when we arrived for our reservation. Visually, I really loved the space - great use of the old brick walls subtly accented by dark wood counters, leather seats and metal tables. The low lighting, when mixed with the music and chatter from the bar/lounge area, created a cool speakeasy type vibe.We were seated in the basement area right in front of the open kitchen - which was cool in order to observe the work being done over the course of the evening. The primary downside however was that the ambience that was present upstairs was less so by the kitchen - I was more aware of the wait staff and kitchen staff buzzing around us retrieving plates.First we ordered a basket of their home-made sourdough with butter. I absolutely love sourdough bread so I couldn't resist trying it. Nice crunch on the crust but still moist and fluffy on the inside. Had that classic sourdough taste as well. This was a great start of the meal for me.On to the starters now, I went with the crispy pig's cheek with slow cooked egg, goldrush apple and kimchi. I was rather intrigued by the combination of ingredients as listed on the menu and how they would mix together. The answer is perfectly. The crunch and fattiness of the pig's cheek, the spiciness of the kimchi, the richness and creaminess of the egg and finally the sweetness of the apple all worked beautifully as a mixture of texture.Our other starter was the house-cured salmon with parsley root, dill and pickled mustard seed. A very elegant dish compared to the strong notes of the previous starter. The star is clearly the salmon and all the other ingredients here act to enhance its inherent flavours. The dill was most notable although part of that to me is how well dill seems to pair with salmon - it seems to make that spice pop more so than others. Very nice dish.My main of choice on this evening was the gnocchi with butternut squash, spinach and goat's curd. Texture-wise, the gnocchi was very interesting - quite a bit more crunch on the exterior than I've typically gotten with gnocchi but thankfully they still kept their pillowy texture inside. The combination of the squash with the goat's curd made for a rather creamy sauce to pair with it. The spinach was good but frankly didn't feel all that necessary in the construction of the plate.Our second main was the Hereford short rib with jerusalem artichoke and pickled walnut dressing. The short rib was heavenly - rich and fatty and fall-apart texture. The pureed artichokes were a nice contrast to the meat and the walnut dressing added some spiciness of the equation. Very enjoyable overall.Looking at the dessert options next, we couldn't say no to some of the options laid before us. First up was the hazelnut ice cream sandwich. Great smooth texture to the ice cream as well as a strong hazelnut flavour. Ideally I would have preferred true cookies to create a full sandwich you could grab but regardless, I did enjoy the crunch from the cookie \"bites\" here.Our other dessert was organic chocolate mousse with blood orange and creme fraiche. A beautiful looking dessert and a delicious one at that. Great contrast between the tartness of the chocolate mousse, the acidity of the orange and the creaminess of the creme fraiche. A nice mixture of textures and flavours.Fifteen was a wonderful experience to finish off our time in London. It's great to see Jamie Oliver set up a restaurant in this non-profit fashion and still ensure that it has the look and feel of a high-end restaurant. The quality you would look for in a Jamie Oliver restaurant was still there and it's great to know that my enjoyment of a great meal may help someone get future employment in the industry. A truly worthwhile cause to support.Cheers!",

A great menu with lots of choice, even with our allergies.The service on the other hand left a bit to be desired. The hostess did not offer to take out coats and umbrella, it was another server who noticed us struggling to stow them somewhere. She brought a cloakroom card so the service was available. Our server seemed only interested in getting our order in, hovering over us with an unpleasant air. When we told him about our allergies (gluten and dairy), he disappeared to the kitchen for about 15 minutes. Should have known about common allergens in the tiny menu. He returned with a list and asked us what we wanted without showing us the list. We picked one item and he told us we couldn't because of the allergies. I finally peaked at the list he had (but didn't show us) and picked an option available. In the end felt more like we were a burden and he was had already moved his hopes to the next seating of our table.The service could learn a thing from the food. Simple, well-executed, and perfect.",

    "text": "Yum!Came here with two friends while on holiday in London. I used to watch Jamie Oliver's show on Food Network so I was excited to see that he had a restaurant we could visit. The inspiration behind Fifteen is pretty inspiring. It's pretty much an establishment (since there are multiple locations) dedicated to getting underprivileged young people exposure to the restaurant industry and give them a chance to get experience and build a life. It's actually affiliated with Jamie Oliver's charity.Anyway, we went relatively early and the restaurant wasn't quite ready yet so we were allowed to sit in the bar area and sip on some drinks while we waited. Once seated, one friend and I each ordered the rainbow trout and our other friend ordered roast chicken. Everything was really yummy and service was pretty quick. Everything is a bit pricey, but it's a fancy place with fancy food, so the price does pretty much match the quality.The ambiance was romantic and cozy and sweet. There were also really interesting salt and pepper holders made from rocks with a piece scooped out to make room to hold the salt and pepper.Being a bit inexperienced with Europe, we didn't know to ask for tap water and so we paid a bunch of useless money for a bottle of water instead. WHOOPS. So tourists, be warned, haha. We also sat around forever before realizing we had to ask for the check (since in America, I guess we're rude and we usher the customers out by forcing the checks on the table).Overall, it was a fun experience.",

As much as I wanted to give Jamie Oliver's Fifteen a glowing review just for the inspired concept - training unemployed young people to cook in a real restaurant setting - I still needed to try the food. First item was the burrata and it was great. Very refreshing and perfect for the London Summer Day (oxymoron?). Instead of the common tomato and basil treatment, they went with peaches and other herbs. It was the favorite dish amongst the whole table. The roast pork, on the other hand, was a let down. It looked amazing on the plate, but it was all show...no go. A big hulking, bland, chewy cut of pork on top of a mushy bell pepper mass. I was tempted to ask for some salt. I was also tempted to send it back for something else...or just take it off the check. In retrospect I wish I had acted on one of those urges, but I didn't want to appear to be the rude American. Perhaps some of the flavors were lost in translation. Is THIS how the British like their pork?! Or maybe this plate was an unfortunate exception. After all, it was recommended by our waitress as the main course for the \u00a326/person lunch. No matter how you explain it, this dish disappointed me.Moving on...a friend ordered a vegetarian risotto which was good. Rich, buttery, and cheesy in all the ways that risotto should be. That said, it didn't really amaze us. Nor did it redeem that pork. (I can really hold a grudge when it comes to food)I admire Jamie Oliver giving back to the community with the Fifteen Chef Apprentice program AND his promotion of healthier eating in schools. Still, I couldn't recommend Fifteen's food to a friend. It all looks great from the outside, but the food fell short.",

    "text": "I understand the Jamie Oliver hype. He's always on the online publications I read and featured in my friends' cookbooks, but I never understood the big deal. If Fifteen represents Jamie Oliver's productions, I can understand. We started with their antipasti board, bread and olive oil. The mozzarella was creamy succulent herb seasoned and featured what tasted like a slightly citrus olive oil. While I enjoyed the meat selection, I also lusted for the pickled beets and charred squash. Because of this mozzarella experience, I ordered two starters, the mozzarella with citrus, rocket and almond along with the wood smoked salmon with potatoes, greens, and capers. The salmon was an indescribable revelation. I want it again. My friends were also pleased with their main entrees. Since we were satisfied so far, we decided to order four items from the dessert menu including the British cheese board. Notable food memories were the basil pannacotta and the cheeses. Great Britain has such a wide range of tasty cheeses. I can't wait to taste more.",

    "text": "Shameless plug: If you'd like to see my Paris food stuffs...go here: illmaisonet.blogspot.com\u2026 \u00a0Some people travel to London to see the Thames, Big Ben and The Parliament. My trip to London was driven by two things. Van Gogh at the National Gallery and Fifteen. I just crammed a bunch of other activities around those two things.For 25 quid, you get a three course meal that's prepared for you by young people that are accomplishing a hell of a lot more in a short amount of time than I did within my first year in culinary school. So, although there were a few minor details about my meal I didn't care for, they're apprentices and if those are the only mistakes they're making...they're geniuses.The hostess was just about the nicest I've ever encountered and knew about Banksy, holy shit. My server was pretty attentive and I felt bad for the Sommelier that his talents weren't being utilized during the afternoon reservations. Poor guy. On with the food...1st -- Handcut Pappardelle with pork, beef \u00a0and lamb Bolognese and pecorino -- This was the lightest pasta I've ever devoured. It was nicely seasoned. The Bolognese had an ever so slight kick towards the end, which I like. And the pecorino just kept melting as I kept shoveling it in. Oh, I wish I could have had just a big bowl of that!2nd -- Leg of Pete Gott's Cumbrian rare breed pork with braised fennel and agretti -- Let me tell you, that agretti was cooked to damn perfection. Those kids really used restraint when it came down to it, it was cooked just enough, but still had a crunch. The fennel was sweet. However, the pork had been braised for around 12 hours and it was delicious, don't get me wrong. But, it had a ribbon of fat surrounded the outer layer. And fat is my friend, when it's crunchy. But, when it's been braised and boiled down...it just becomes flabby and chewy. No bueno.When you put some of the pork, with the fennel and the agretti together on your fork...perfection. Real textural and flavor contrast that's amazing.3rd -- How did the server know I wanted chocolate before I even opened my mouth? Either he's really good, or he knows that almost everyone woman adores chocolate. Amedei chocolate mousse on a shortbread base with raspberry compote. I woofed it down in no time flat. The sort of tangy sour raspberries offset with the rich and luscious chocolate mousse. Oh, my goodness. And they even put a little happy birthday message on my plate. Awww. For some reason my camera decided to take a dump and misstep the dessert. But, you'll get photos of the other two courses.All in all, I'd have to say Fifteen is a success. I can only hope that the youth getting a fantastic opportunity here don't take it for granted.",

However, I wish we would have been offered more than 1 vegetarian option- usually at these kinds of restaurants, the chef will offer to make something off the menu when choice is limited (and we were 2 vegetarians who ended up ordering exactly the same meal). Prices also seem to have gone up since we were there last and service was not as good.",

Our waiter disappeared for eons and looked at me down his nose when I ordered another glass of wine. Well, hello, you disappeared. The first round of drinks took a long time to be served and the second took even longer. The burrata with peas and mint was good. My butter lettuce in the cucumber salad was brown so I had to remove large pieces of slimy greens from the plate. No fun. If I ever came back (though I probably won't return) I'd have the cod, which had a nice flavor. My friends enjoyed their pork, which was seared surprisingly rare, and the porcini and ricotta-stuffed pasta, which had a broth poured on top, table side. Overall, it wasn't the dining experience I'd hoped for my friend's birthday.",

    "text": "Thought this place was pretty good but a little bit expensive for what you get compared to what you can get in other restaurants in London for similar food for less money. Overall, I'd give this 3.5-4 stars. I do like the concept and idea behind the restaurant where proceeds go to a charity and they train apprentices alongside restaurant professionals.I came here on a business trip so ate solo, which was fine - most people here come in groups of 2-4 which I would recommend so that you can try more dishes and share things. They have a 6 course tasting menu for \u00a360 which is not that cheap but not outrageous (one of the 6 dishes is a cheese platter). Homemade Sourdough Bread & Butter (\u00a34) - They were actually kind enough to make me a half order of this since I wanted to try it, but obviously didn't need to eat an entire basket of bread. While I appreciated that I was able to get a smaller amount, the bread wasn't really worth the calories and carbs to me. Being on a wedding diet, I tried to make a special exception here because I wanted to try the homemade bread, but the sourdough was just okay - maybe it would have been better served warm/hot, but it was just okay. There was also a seeded cracker that was good but not outstanding. and 2 small triangles of rye bread. I wanted to love this, but sadly, I didn't.Short Rib Croquettes, Sour Cherry Ketchup (\u00a35) - These were small, maybe about t7 sour of the size of a ping pong ball, but I really liked these. They were flavorful, not salty, and the sweet and sour cherry ketchup paired well with this. I would definitely recommend this appetizer.Salmon, Beets, Hazelnut, Tarragon Sauce (\u00a325) - This salmon dish was what kicked the restaurant up from 3.5 stars to 4 stars. This was probably one of the better fish dishes that I've had at a restaurant and the portion was quite generous too. The salmon was perfectly cooked and had a crispy skin. The beets were delicious and paired well with the hazelnuts and creme fraiche, and the green tarragon sauce the fish was in was unique and delicious. Such a winner with this dish - healthy, filling and tasty and the way every fish dish should be.All in all, my meal was on the pricier side, but the dishes are interesting and prepared well. I was just disappointed in the bread, but I was appreciative they were able to make a smaller serving for me since I was dining solo. I'd come back here again to try more dishes or just to get the salmon again.",

    "text": "Let me first start this review by saying that I trust in the Yelp community and read all of the detailed reviews over the last year before my visit. I believe there have been some significant changes made to improve their customer experience. For my visit to London, I made it a point to visit one of Jamie's restaurants being a fan of him from a young age. FIFTEEN seemed to be the place that would showcase the best of what the local produce had to offer.It was a quick ride in the tube from my hotel in London Bridge and I arrived to the restaurant 15 minutes early for my 6pm reservation.The staff was incredible. I was immediately greeted by the host and offered a cocktail at the bar when I arrived. I decided on a lovely Prosecco although the gin bar did look great and sat back while the waiting staff was getting prepped for the night. It was fun to watch as the staff were blindfolded around the manager and was doing some blind tastings of food before service. You could tell that this was a normal ritual to expand the knowledge of the servers.Being prepared for a large meal, I decided on the 5 course menu with the wine pairings. Coming from the Napa Valley and being a wine specialist, I have to say that they nailed all of their pairings. I could write and entire review just on the wines alone, but you'll just have to take my word for it.Every dish served was unique, elegant, delicious and perfectly cooked. The flow was well timed for each dish and I didn't feel overwhelmed with proportions by the end of the night.I would easily say that this is one of the best restaurants at this price point in London and look forward to my next opportunity to visit.",

I had the best gin and tonic of my entire life, and the Iberico pork was a unique (and delicious) presentation.But I have to dock stars because our server did not know anything about the menu. She couldn't identify the cut of the Iberico, didn't know which components of dishes could or could not be left out, didn't know the varietal of a btg white, and when asked to explain one of the desserts, was unable to do anything except list the ingredients printed on the menu. She was unable to explain black garlic. She was a competent order taker, but it was as if she had never seen the menu before arriving at the table.She was quite sweet, and our service ran more or less smoothly, but, at a restaurant of this caliber (read: price), I don't personally think it's acceptable to have a server know this little about the menu. It affected our meal on literally every course, from aperitifs to desserts. Disappointing.",

Dessert was delicious Coconut Ice cream and Mango puree with biscuits chips.We would recommend this restaurant Fifteen to anyone wanting a special night out while in London.Dean & LisaAustralia",

I'm not a fan of gin and because it was warm and a bit stuffy in the restaurant, I ordered their only glass of Rose' which was not good at all.The food itself is OK - it's nothing to write home about and it is definitely not worth the price.The service is fine - my experience wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews for this restaurant but I wouldn't say it was good.",

The croquettes turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. The meat was so flavorful and the sauce was kind of like a bbq. Comes with 3 but you'll want more. \u00a0Then I had the crab dish for the starter. Very nice and light. Came with 3 sauces that were very good with the crab. Really only enough for one person. Wouldn't recommend sharing. \u00a0For the main I had the anglotti (something like that) pasta dish with truffle and parmesan sauce. The sauce was very thick but still quite light and not overpowering. Parmesan creamy with a hint of lemon I think. Very good. My friend had the rotisserie chicken which I did try and it was delicious. Buttery lemon taste Great service as well",

Visiting from America, my guest and I made reservations beforehand as this was a \"must do\" for me. Our server Marta, was very enthusiastic and guided us through the menu very well. They have a suggested tasting menu for dinner as well as their regular menu. We over ordered, trying to get a taste of everything. We also made sure to try their cocktail of the night and the suggested wine. When our trout came, it did look a bit undercooked but the sauces (and probably the wine) made it delicious. Both of us questioned it briefly, but ate it trusting this restaurant and its \"skilled\" chefs.This was a BIG mistake we both got SEVERE FOOD POISONING. The middle of the night and the next day were a nightmare. I called and the manager gave a half hearted apology and said he'd call me in a few hours about this issue. 6 hours later still no call one of us ended up hospitalized and I called to tell them. The woman who answered said the manager was \"busy.\" And would call back. I never did get that call back.This place is a HEALTH HAZARD. I've never (and I'm well traveled and eat in some pretty shady places) have experienced this. I wonder if Mr. Oliver is aware of this situation.A mistake is a mistake and I could have gotten past this because obviously no one intends to do this. But the disregard for guests who spent OVER $200 USD is appalling.",

    "text": "I had heard about Fifteen the way that most people had; from Jamie Olivers TV programme about the restaurant. I knew the principal - that the chefs have been brought in from disadvantaged back rounds and were working in the kitchens. Then one evening, I was sitting with a friend in Hoxton Square and got chatting to two suited and booted young guys. They explained that they were going off to Jamie's birthday party, and that they had previously been working in the kitchens. They told me about the lives that they had came from, which were pointing in one, pretty bleak direction, and how getting a stint in the kitchen had changed everything. One of the guys was now working in Fifteen Cornwall, the other was starting in Claridges. After that, my friend and I made up our minds to try out Fifteen for ourselves.We didn't have a reservation, but that wasn't a problem. We were seated in the upstairs part - the trattoria. This level is like an upscale Carluccios - one part deli, lots of big wooden tables, rustic Italian food. downstairs is the more expensive restaurant. I was worried that it would be a little of a novelty experience, which would overpower the quality of the food. I needn't have worried. The food was confident, very tasty, absolutely the kind of thing that I would expect from a top class Italian. We shared an antipasti to start with, followed by a seafood risotto, and ravioli of summer squash. I can't remember what dessert we had, but I recall being very satisfied with the whole affair. It was also the kind of place that you could spend all day in. They start early for breakfasts, so this is what I am going to try next.",

Interestingly, the previous evening, two pundits on London TV were arguing about whether Jamie had gotten too fat to be a spokesperson for nutritious food. Our experiencess left us puzzled. My wife and one of our friends had lamb that was riddled with fat and the bed of spinach on which it sat was soaked with fat. I had a large pork roulade with 1/2 inch of fat around the exterior and cutely presented with two-large \"cracklins,\" which, of course, are pure fat -- in case anybody wants to eat them. This entree as well was left to float on a fat- soaked bed of spinach. Given the exchange rate, the tab for food and wine was $250 for the four of us, quite steep when we really wanted to see what Oliver was going to do with nutritious food. He missed his chance.",
