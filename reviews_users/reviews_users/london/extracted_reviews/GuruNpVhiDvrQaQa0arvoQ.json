    "text": "I'm giving this place 3 stars, because, although the food is phenomenal, the service is awful. My hubby and I wanted to have a fish and chips night on Thursday this week and we chose this place based on its great reviews in Yelp. When we arrived to the restaurant, there was a line in front of the take-away counter, but we weren't sure if it was the take away line or the dining in line. I just wanted to look inside to see if there is a separate line within the restaurant, it wasn't, and while I was asking if the line was for the take away to a lady in the line, somebody, which turned out to be one of the waiters or owners of the place, told me to stop there and that they will call us when there is availability in an extremely rude manner. A moment later, he came back and told us there is a place for two and we became \"eligible\" to eat here. I saw the same guy shouting to other patrons as well about where they need to stand and when to enter the dining room. But how hard could it be to write a note to the front door saying that \"The line start here, and wait for your waitress to be seated\". As a first timer, how am I supposed to know what is inside our what the regulars do when they arrive. There is nothing I can say more about the food. It was delicious. Bread, butter and shrimp appetizer are served immediately. Hubby got the Master's Fish, and I got the haddock (? not sure). Both were very soft and tasty, and the portions were huge. We also didn't like the ambiance. Not that we expected fine dining experience, but the tables were very close and it was very loud! At first, we were ok with it, but then a big group arrived and were seated next to us. We were so close and we were almost the extension of their group. It was so loud, and my hubby and I finished our food very quickly even without talking to each other. We just wanted to leave and never come back. Again, if you are in for a great food with the softest fish & chips, order a take out and eat it in the park close by. Although we loved the food, I don't think we will ever go again.",

Best pickles ive ever had. Our female waitress was lovely and really sweet. The male waiter was a bit rude. Id skip on the mushy peas, they were literally just mushy peas. Free bread and cold shrimp but dont load up on it. Reasonably priced.",

If you go anywhere in UK, the portions are half the size of a US portion. The batter was thick and crispy but the insides were moist & tender. Fries were just excellent and not soggy at all. Like a lot of family businesses, they're closed on Sundays so make sure you go during the week! This place is a must-try if you're in London, for sure.",

Either way, turn up early if you want to get one of the plastic-topped tables and not just stand in the take away queue.As the other reviews say, this place does great Fish and Chips and feels proper bonafide London through and through. Pickled onion with your plate sir? We had a lovely crispy whitebait starter and satisfyingly bright-green mushy peas. Our cod and chips (regular size) were too large to finish but golden crispy and delicious. I particularly loved their chips here. We also had a special of grilled sea bream which was fantastic and a massive portion given the price of a tenner. You'd get half of the fish for 20 quid anywhere else and it'd be ruined by some french sauce, so hats off to master superfish for cooking it right. Highly recommended timewarp fish and chips. Their signs still have their phone number beginning '071...' which means they've not bothered updating them since before 1995.",

    "text": "If you ever wondered whether a restaurant's interior could make you feel depressed, a dinnertime visit to Masters Super Fish will confirm that it definitely can! Just along busy Waterloo Road, Masters Super Fish is a real hole-in-the-wall. Walking in during dinner time, the restaurant was mostly empty, except for a few tables of men who were eating by themselves. If you go, get takeout or maybe try lunchtime.Onto the food. The cod fillets are huge--unlike a lot of fish and chips places in the U.S. that give you several pieces, here you get one dinner plate-sized fillet. The fish was incredibly fresh and flavorful, as promised. The breading came crispy but with all the fish juices, the bottom was soggy by the time I got to it. But the cod was really good! Chips were not consistent--some were crispy while others were soft and potatoey. Best to go for the fish and peel off the fried stuff.",

    "text": "What I ate on a Tuesday about 8.30pm4 Shell-Prawns, Picked Onions, Gherkins - ComplimentaryAll dine-in customers received a few prawns and some bread and butter to tide them over until the main event arrived. We appreciated this as our mustard and pepper fish took a very long time to prepare. Onions and gherkins were chilled, crunchy and vinegary.Masters Skate Fried in Pepper - \u00a39.25 (includes chips)This huge fleshy skate wing was covered in a fine black pepper and fried perfectly, the dense flakes peeled wonderfully off the spiny bones making the crispy skin and juicy skate a delicious mouthful. The pepper crust would have hugely benefited from seasoning with salt and lemon as this had to be liberally and constantly applied. Because of the density of the fish and it's peppery jacket the skate retained heat, the last bite as delicious as the first.Masters Cod Fried in Mustard - \u00a39.50 (includes chips)The strong mustard flavour worked perfectly with chunky cod and was seasoned very well, we preferred this dish to the skate as there was less hassle with self-seasoning. Chips on both were good, crispy but lacking a smooth puffy interior. We ordered haddock but they only had cod left, with cod depletion issues it is a shame it was not the other way round.Mixed Salad - \u00a32.00We were too full for this so it came home with us. Even so it was not the most appealing salad, a few leaves, grated carrot, tomatoes and tonnes of sliced raw onion.Mushy Peas - \u00a31.50Chunky, thick and tasty, served in a sensible sized portion for two to share. The addition of salt, vinegar and pepper made it irresistible and it was finished off pretty quickly.Drink4 Pots of Tea - \u00a34.00Tea was fine but the milk was UHT and spoilt the taste.AtmosphereWe sat in but there is also a takeaway window for speedy visits. The dining room is clean (if a little chilly) and showcases a wonderful mix of customers. We joined single cabbies who all seemed to order the Master Special (247g prime cod), a family, a couple and a few business men with overnight trolleys straight from Waterloo station (3 mins walk away).OffersLunch Special - Cod/Plaice/Huss with tea or coffee/soft drink - \u00a36.50/\u00a37.00 (with chips)VerdictGO!We will definitely return when we feel we can take the calories of a battered fish. Looking at other tables made us pretty jealous as the majority had ordered the huge crunchy fish that curled up off their plates however we really enjoyed our meal and left satisfied.",

    "text": "As a newbie traveler, I am seeing for the first time just how much work and preparation goes into planning out a trip. Especially since I am traveling solo, preparation and planning are key to ensure that I maximize my time spent in a city while minimizing the amount of time spent waiting on lines or wandering about hopelessly lost. I found Traveladvisor particularly useful, as it guided me in my decision-making process of which sites to head to first (get to the Tower of London when it opens and see the Crown Jewels as soon as you enter to beat the lines) and what time to arrive at certain sites (get to Buckingham Palace more than an hour before the 11:30 start time of the Changing of the Guard if you want to get a good view at the palace gates). Similarly, Chowhound is my go-to resource for learning about which restaurants and dining establishments are worth trying out. Travelers commonly ask for restaurant suggestions and recommendations with the caveat that they want to go to \"where the locals eat.\" In researching which London restaurants serve the best fish and chips, one name that kept coming up as a place frequented by cabbies and locals alike was Masters Super Fish. With a name like that, I knew that I just had to check it out, and in the end, I was really glad that I did. After spending my first morning in London exploring the Tower of London and Tower Bridge, I arrived at Masters at about 12:15 to a sparsely filled dining room with a couple of tables occupied by what appeared to be locals. With my order of the lunch special fish and chips placed, it was only a minute later that I was served a complementary trio of boiled shrimp. These things were tiny, but hey, they were free, so I guess I can't complain. About ten minutes later, my plate of fried cod and chips was served, along with a helping of pickled onions and a pickle. Now, again, as my last post on fish and chips stated, I am by no means a fish and chips expert, but I found the fish and chips at Masters to be pretty fantastic. The fish was obviously freshly fried, and the golden brown, craggy crust was pleasingly crisp and not greasy in the slightest. I think I may prefer the thinner crust found at Luke's over the thicker-crusted fish at Masters, but that's just nitpicking, as the fish was really quite impressive with a moist and flaky interior. The batter was tasty and not soggy in the slightest, and the chips, fat and crisp, were far superior to Luke's, which were a bit pale and flaccid (that's what she said!). When doused with some malt vinegar and eaten with the pickled onion to provide some acidity, the fried cod at Masters was a work of art, indeed.Masters is the kind of place where you will get honest-to-goodness delicious food that is far enough off the beaten path that it isn't swamped by tourists. It is the type of place that has a steady flow of customers who live in the area, and it's exactly the kind of place that I am looking for when I want to eat as the locals eat: a nondescript, neighborhood restaurant offering good food that I can't get back at home in the US. If I lived anywhere near Masters, I would make a return trip. Alas, my short weekend jaunt in London did not allow me to return, and with several other restaurants on my to-do list, I did my best to savor every last bite of the terrific fish and chips. Masterful, indeed.",

Hubby got the large (LARGE! nearly falling off the edge of the oval plate!) cod special and I got the haddock. They didn't ask about batter type but when the food arrived the cod had the classic golden crispy batter while my haddock was a lighter mustard-based crust. The waiter said if I didn't like it they could change it, but this way we could try a couple different things. And this is what I would recommend - the mustard was a nice touch and the batter itself very light. Their classic batter was delicious! Slightly sweet with perfect texture. Our fries were good, more golden/done as I noticed the couples' next to us were very light and not so appealing.Overall pretty good prices as far as London goes. It's small, cramped and homey inside. Not quite dirty but there were some flaky fish bits on the chairs. Plenty of tourists and locals eating in and steady to-go traffic as well. Solid place!",

Off I wandered to find a bit of a dive with a few Asians working the counter - not the amazing fish and chips I was imagining, but I trust Yelp, so...Waited a bit but was served bread/butter and a few whole shrimps (gratis). This was a nice way to warm up to what was next. Lemonade was clear, interesting, but good - I thought it was water at first. Looked over my shoulder in the kitchen and saw a real English chap preparing the food so I calmed down a bit. A bit later they brought over a HUGE piece of cod with chips, pickles and onions. The fish was steamy-hot and soft inside, crispy outside - it was basically perfect.... and about half the price of the other shop I visited.Needless to say my plate was clean, my belly full and my first fish-n-chips experience in England a wonderful memory.

It was delicious! There was one fish on my plate that just melted in your mouth. I have no idea which one it was since they were not labeled... But it was the 2 thinnest pieces of fish on the plate (I received about 8 pieces in my order.) The fries were hit or miss depending on which ones you ate since they varied in shape, size and therefore also varied in \"done-ness\". If you sit down you get little shrimp which are seasoned well, the tarter sauce, ketchup, malt vinegar, and the pickles (a pickled cucumber spear & half an onion). If you get the food to go it is cheaper, but I'm guessing you don't get any of the thing listed above in the to-go orders.The service was not at all warm, but for the amazing food it still earns 4 stars!",

Complimentary very fresh bread & butter and prawns - much appreciated thanks.My cod and chips was just right for a lunch portion (not too massive) and really one of the best I've had. First off, the fish. The batter here is the more substantial and crunchy kind which I like best and the fish inside was just perfectly cooked, I mean perfect. What does that mean? It means, first \u00a0that it's super fresh and second that it's cooked to exactly the right point where the white flesh quivers into gentle, super moist flakes, against crunchy, ungreasy, flavourful batter. A culinary match made in heaven when it's just right. Further bonus that the cod is skinless which I like.Chips had just the right size, texture and light crispiness on the outside, yielding on the inside.and...pickles (gherkins and onions) and sauce boats of \u00a0tartar sauce and ketchup are offered to help yourself on the side. Never ketchup for me on fish and chips, just plenty of salt and vinegar. The tartar sauce was good.Almost forgot...a proper pot of tea and jug of milk round the whole thing off.

I love eating at places like that when I travel.The cod and chips were the best I've ever had. The cod was really crispy on the outside and super succulent on the inside. The chips were also crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Don't forget to splash some malt vinegar over everything.I would definitely recommend coming here for the fish & chips.",

The tartar sauce that comes with is also pleasantly balanced and not overly briny, as you might find in the States when shops try too hard to recreate it. The textures were lovely and the flavors well managed. Their desserts were good, too -- but if you want to try their banoffee ice cream pot do so early as they may run out!Be forewarned -- if you're looking for fine dining, this isn't the place. But if you're looking to have amazing fish and chips in a more authentic setting, hit up MSF.",

I have also tried the order where you get a platter of small pieces of all the different types of fish (plaice, salmon, cod, etc) instead of ordering one big piece of fried fish. I actually didn't like it at all, as the piece sizes are small and when gives you mostly a mouthful of fried batter. My favourite part of the cod was the tender and flaky insides, so I highly recommend just getting that, as it's a good portion and lets you really enjoy the the fish, not just the batter.",

This place popped up on Yelp as one of the top places for the specific dish.It's a small little restaurant, not too far from the Waterloo station. You walk in and seat yourself. Service leaves much to be desired. They weren't particularly rude, just not friendly. When we sat down, the waiter gruffly asked \"What do you want,\" and when we inquired about the food, he just pointed to the menu. We never felt offended, just taken aback by his gruffness.Now for the dish. There are two types of fish you can choose from. My companion and I decided to split the traditional cod. So glad we did because the fish was HUGE. Even after sharing, we couldn't finish the food. The batter of the fish had a nice solid crunch and was surprisingly not greasy! However, I thought the fish was bland and nothing extraordinary. Maybe I'm just not a fan of fish and chips?",

Now, I have caught skate by mistake many a time while deep sea fishing and never once decided to keep it, but for some reason this evening I said, 'what the heck' and ordered it. \u00a0This is a mistake that I made so that you won't have to- let's just say that maybe if one was sitting down with a fork and knife it could potentially have been a decent choice, but in case there was any lingering doubt, as an on-the-road takeaway, skate is not a recommended choice.Price was very very reasonable, chips were good and freshly made, service was quick and no-nonsense.",

The last time I was in London, I tried either really cheap or really pricey fish & chips places... so it was always not great or simply overpriced. I think Master Superfish is a good compromise. Don't expect a cutesy shop or anything like that though... the interior is more like a school cafeteria. There's probably going to be be a bit of a wait for your food but it's worth it for the huge portions and tasty fish. Prawns are complimentary, as well as bread & butter. We got the Master's special (cod) and it was 9.50 and came with plenty of chips. I also ordered the calamari appetizer for 4.50. When the food came, I was astonished at how humongous the portions were. This was no \"multiple-piece\" meal. The cod was one huge filet that took up the majority of the plate. My friend ordered something similarly sized and the two of us only managed to finish maybe less than half of what we'd ordered. The fish was fresh and very tasty, though after a while I got sick of the fried batter and started to peel a bit of it off. Definitely worth a try!",

    "text": "A great no nonsense fish and chip restaurant and takeaway. The portions are HUGE and always cooked perfectly; crispy batter with no soggy bits, perfectly flakey fish and lightly browed thick-cut chips. They are without a doubt 10/10 and I've eaten this English delicacy in most places around the UK. The price is also really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food.The restaurant area is great in my opinion. Completely basic, but it adds to the authenticity of the greasy spoon feel and after all you're coming here for the food and not a 5 star dining experience. Last time I went for a takeaway and the man serving me was an absolute grump, but who cares, this is a chippy love, not The Ivy. If you go without any expectations and just eat it's a great place. This may sound strange to tourists, but the British relationship with fish and chips calls for this kind of low key delivery. For something that used to be eaten out of old newspaper sheets (the hot oil would allow toxic ink to seep into the food) anything too fine would somehow spoil the tradition.What I also like is that the customers really vary from locals to workmen to post theatre goers in the evenings so it's actually a great atmosphere and always packed. It has a big following.The only reason I knocked one star off is because they have a sign proclaiming that they fry in ground nut oil and yet you can clearly see giant vats of vegetable oil behind the counter. Peanut oil is a healthier choice compared to commercial use veg oil, which is usually a blend of all sorts of yak. But once in a while, these are some of the best fish 'n' chips going south of the river.",

They close at 330 but were nice enough to serve us even though they were only open for 30 minutes. I ordered the lunch special of classic fish and chips with a side of coleslaw. My friend ordered a mustard fish and chips, and the other ordered grilled fish and chips! First, they bring you incredibly soft bread and whole shrimp as an appetizer. I dont really eat bread, but it was so soft and good I ate probably 3 pieces. The shrimp was good too but being a whole shrimp its a lot of work. My fish was huge and still had the skin on it even though it was battered! The fries were good too but their slaw and tartar sauce really pushed the place over the edge for me. It was by far the best fish and chips I have ever had, even from another place in london too that was highly recommended. My friends Lemon fish and chips was even better than what I ordered so get that if you go there. The meal was also relatively inexpensive but a great value overall!",

    "text": "I typically look for hole-in-the-wall spots to get fish & chips when I'm in London. \u00a0When you see locals, particularly road crew workers, in these spots, you know you're going to get quality for a good price. \u00a0This was a \"fully licensed\" hole in the wall with lots of superlatives in the title, so I was hopeful. I was a little apprehensive when nearly all the tables were empty at noon, but I hoped that since it was a weekend, workers wouldn't be out so that would explain all the empty tables. \u00a0I should have known that when I saw the giant map with pins marking where people originated to enjoy their fish as well as all of the foreign currency on the walls that this was a joint that fed off of people passing through, not necessarily a local point of preference.I grabbed a seat and placed an order for f&c with mushy peas. Food was brought out super fast! \u00a0Like, freaky fast. \u00a0Beside my order was a small basket of bread and butter and a small bowl with 3 prawns. \u00a0I don't know how to attack the prawns, so they went to waste, but everything else was sampled. \u00a0The fish wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't among the best I've had. \u00a0It wasn't exceptionally flaky and the battering tasted bland. \u00a0They do bring out a vat of tartar sauce, though, so that added a good bit of flavor. \u00a0The chips were inconsistent, some of them limp while others were so crunchy that I was worried about my molars. \u00a0Service started out great, but dropped off precipitously after the food was delivered. \u00a0Not terrible, but I don't think I'll be making it back to Master's on my next trip.",

    "text": "5 stars for the food, 1 star for the rude service, but it's sort of our fault.Disclaimer: I don't have much experience eating in London, and am not used to separate lines for takeaway vs dining in.Upon entering the building, there's a small counter with a chalkboard menu and a door off to the right that opens into a room with seating. As a naive American, I assumed that customers order at the counter, and then take their food to the adjoining room to eat. We ordered the Master's special which was posted on the chalkboard and 10 minutes later we were handed a hot steaming bundle of freshly fried fish and chips, wrapped in paper, with the grease just starting to ooze out. We took the bundle and entered the dining room, but the guy behind the counter yelled at us to get out, saying that our order was for takeaway only. We pleaded ignorance and offered to pay the difference, but the dude shook his head and pointed towards the door. \u00a0It was pouring rain when we arrived, but fortunately, it stopped. We stood outside in the 45 degree (8 Celcius?) cold and ate the fish and chips. I have a big appetite, but I have to say that a single order was enough to fill both of us up. It was an enormous amount of grease, but the fish was super flaky and tasty, and the chips were large and crisp. Perhaps the best fish and chips I've ever had. However, being forced to eat outside standing in the cold really detracted from the experience, but it is kind of memorable in its own way.",

    "text": "A quick google search will show that Master's Superfish is one of the most popular of the hundreds of Fish and Chips shops in London and since I live near by, I had to give it a try. The fish was definitely a step up from your usual chippies with a very nice delicate batter covering a tender filet of cod. I also liked the extra touches. Every meal comes with complimentary french bread and butter and starts with three peel and eat whole shrimp. I would caution that the shrimp may not be for everyone though. The ones that came to our table were loaded with shrimp eggs which were a big turn off for my friend, though didn't bother me too much. Also, during the meal, the waiter comes by with a selection of pickles to compliment the meal. The pickled onions were excellent and a great fresh accompaniment to the stodgy fare of a fish & chip supper. My only concern was with the chips, which were a bit hard on the inside, indicating they needed to be cooked a bit longer. The service was also very basic, with not much interaction or friendliness on the part of the wait staff. Price-wise, I think the value is spot on, with the meal coming with bread, shrimp, fish, chips, pickled gherkins and onions coming to just over 8 pounds. All in all, this is definitely a good place if you're craving fish and chips, though I don't know if its worth a trip out of the way.Takeaway also available...",

    "text": "What4 Shell-Prawns, Picked Onions, Gherkins \u00a0ComplimentaryAll dine-in customers received a few prawns and some bread and butter to tide them over until the main event arrived. We appreciated this as our mustard and pepper fish took a very long time to prepare. Onions and gherkins were chilled, crunchy and vinegary. Masters Skate Fried in Pepper \u00a0\u00a39.25 (includes chips)This huge fleshy skate wing was covered in a fine black pepper and fried perfectly, the dense flakes peeled wonderfully off the spiny bones making the crispy skin and juicy skate a delicious mouthful. The pepper crust would have hugely benefited from seasoning with salt and lemon as this had to be liberally and constantly applied. Because of the density of the fish and it's peppery jacket the skate retained heat, the last bite as delicious as the first. Masters Cod Fried in Mustard \u00a0\u00a39.50 (includes chips)The strong mustard flavour worked perfectly with chunky cod and was seasoned very well, we preferred this dish to the skate as there was less hassle with self-seasoning. Chips on both were good, crispy but lacking a smooth puffy interior. We ordered haddock but they only had cod left, with cod depletion issues it is a shame it was not the other way round. Mixed Salad \u00a0\u00a32.00We were too full for this so it came home with us. Even so it was not the most appealing salad, a few leaves, grated carrot, tomatoes and tonnes of sliced raw onion. Mushy Peas \u00a0\u00a31.50Chunky, thick and tasty, served in a sensible sized portion for two to share. The addition of salt, vinegar and pepper made it irresistible and it was finished off pretty quickly. Drink4 Pots of Tea \u00a0\u00a34.00Tea was fine but the milk was UHT and spoilt the taste. AtmosphereWe sat in but there is also a takeaway window for speedy visits. The dining room is clean (if a little chilly) and showcases a wonderful mix of customers. We joined single cabbies who all seemed to order the Master Special (247g prime cod), a family, a couple and a few business men with overnight trolleys straight from Waterloo station (3 mins walk away). OffersLunch Special \u00a0Cod/Plaice/Huss with tea or coffee/soft drink \u00a0\u00a36.50/\u00a37.00 (with chips) VerdictWe will definitely return when we feel we can take the calories of a battered fish. Looking at other tables made us pretty jealous as the majority had ordered the huge crunchy fish that curled up off their plates however we really enjoyed our meal and left satisfied.",

Their fish comes fresh every day from the fish market and they use ground nut oil which gives the fish a lovely flavour. The portions are large and the fillets are always big and chunky, especially the 'masters special' which is an enormous cod fillet. There is a sit down restaurant which is usually frequented by a good mix of locals, cabbies (always a good sign) and business people / tourists, and they also have a takeaway which has hundreds of old event tickets and football match tickets pinned to the walls which I always find fascinating to look at while I wait for my order (they always cook to order so everything is fresh). Prices are a bit on the high side but it's London and worth paying the extra for guaranteed good quality. Highly recommend.",

So while visiting a friend, I told him to take me to the best fish and chips place that you know of. \u00a0Lord know this had to be on top of his list. \u00a0The Cod was battered perfectly and the texture of the fish was moist and flaky that it left your mouth wanting more. \u00a0 The atmosphere isn't that of a fancy design or high class. \u00a0But if you want a great bite this is the spot to be!",

    "text": "Like R.C. I'm also reviewing as a tourist (however Canadian and well versed in the fish and chips school of thought). I chose Master because it not only came highly recommended as an delish and financially reasonable, it was also in the area I was staying - Southwark. Close to several theatres and bars, including the Old Vic, and not very far from South Bank at all, Master Superfish is definitely a local go-to for HUGE portions of tasty fish with perfectly seasoned batter. Don't expect attention to decor or exception service (in fact, expect the opposite) but I suppose when you get a piece of fish the length of your arm (and this is the small size) for 8 pounds, you certainly can't complain about anything else. I will say that although my waitress was very friendly, the cashier/other waitress, could not be more rude - unprovoked.Wait, I have yet to describe the fixings - each meal comes with 4 unpeeled prawns, picked onions, huge gherkins and a mini sauce cart. Bold face statement: the best fish and chips I have ever had. Master Superfish, has ruined me for Canada's Pacific Halibut forever.",

I recommend getting your food to go honestly getting service was slower than if I had caught the fish myself. My fish had skin on it, which was sadly a turn off. Why not filet the dam thing then bread it? I guess a yank doesn't get it. The stiff drinks were lacking in the stiff part. I made a request for mustard twice and was finally served something rather nice. The shrimp are whole, so be ready to get your hands dirty, with by the way nothing clean your hands on. Should have got the haddock my friend got. Much better than the cod for sure. The peas are mushy but poorly flavoured with nothing. So salt and pepper liberously. I was offered pickled onions and pickles. It was a ton of food and not a lot of room for the table. I left feeling rather greasy. Offordable yes, but honestly they do so little right it seems not worth it to try any other food. My partner has been left in bed with horrible stomach flu much to rivel Montezuma's revenge.",

The fish comes in daily, and fries and fish are cooked to order. The batter was light, and the fish was not greasy. I had the Cod fish and chips. The chips had a nice, crisp flavor. This restaurant is not elegant by any means, this is about the food. It's not a pub or fancy restaurant - it is more like a diner in the US. I skipped the shrimp they brought out before dinner, preferring my shrimp to be headless and legless. You order at the counter or at your table, they cook it and bring it out to you. We also had mushy peas - I had never had them before, and they tasted a little like thick pea soup without any salt. It's an easy walk to the Waterloo station.",

If we come back i would split a Masters special or regular plate and try maybe the sticky toffee dessert and maybe share an appetizer also. The fish was super moist and light and crunchy on the outside but simply too much of just a couple good things (other is the massive quantity of chips). The few super small boiled shrimp they give you with the bread seemed odd and not stereotypically English f&c but maybe that's my ignorance of Engligh f&c? House white wine was nice with the cod.",

Being in London, my friends and I wanted to try the best fish and chips and after yelping away, my friend found master superfish! We got a bit lost getting there but it was worth it all in the end.We all ordered the lunch time special, fish and chips with tea. They give shrimps and bread as appetizers. I thought the shrimps to be a bit weird but the bread tasted good. The fish was nice and crisp.. not too oily like other places I've tried. The chips were also delicious... I couldn't help but keep eating even though I was pretty full. The owners also came around with pickled onions and pickles which tasted good with the fish as it gets rid of some of the oily-ness from eating fish and chips. I hope to go back again one day when I visit revisit LONDON!!!",
