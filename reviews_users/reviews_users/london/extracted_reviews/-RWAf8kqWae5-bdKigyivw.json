    "text": "Dumplings' Legend was the dinner stop on a recent caravan through the West End, at the recommendation of Nida K. See, being my flatmate, she knows how much I love Xiao Long Bao, and wanted to give me another experience. So, all I had was Xiao Long Bao! Others had various dishes from dumplings, noodles, and full entrees, but me, all I needed was my dumplings.First, Dumplings' Legend is BYOB, so BYO-what you want and you won't have to dash out mid-meal like we did.Next, the pork and crab XLB was fantastic! The spicy pork, not so much. It was actually too spicy, but not in a fiery kind of way, but more in a \"there's too much black pepper happening here\" kind of way. I'd definitely go back for the non-spicy ones though.Other than that, it's a standard dim sum restaurant, much like the ones I love in the States. That being said, it's obviously a bit farther from authentic, despite being in the heart of Chinatown. But, it is right in the heart of everything, which is a bonus.",

The menu is a bit over-whelming and the service was pretty slow once we couldn't order fast enough but nevertheless friendly. Getting there before 8pm is recommended, it got very noisy and crowded - a couple actually left after waiting too long to be served.I want to go back and try a combination of items (mainly dumplings), wish the portions would allow - this place is definitely group friendly!",

    "text": "ok,i really really really wanted to love this place, but honestly, it was just ok. For London where Chinese food is lacking, it was great. But honestly, the xiao long bao is just as good (if not better) in Los Angeles, where the cost is 1/2 of that. We ordered 6 orders of XLB, 1 eggplant dish, 1 rice dish, and our total came out to $104!!!! In LA, the same order would cost less than $60. \u00a0Each order of XLB averaged 6.60 - 8.5 eur. CRAZY. This place is posh and modern, and you can watch a billion chinese dumpling chefs wrap dumplings while you're eagerly waiting, but it's hard for me to give them a superb review bc LA is so much cheaper. It is what it is.One thing I didn't like was the staff. We told them that we had a party of 4, thinking that a baby doesn't count. When we finally got called to our table, we asked them for a high chair. \"Oh, 3 adults and 1 baby?\" \"No, 4 adults and 1 baby.\" The skinny bartender got involved (don't ask me why....) and yelled angrily, \"is it 4 or 5? 4 is different from 5 and 5 is different from 4! Which one is it?!\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! He wanted to pick a fight over numbers?! This is a common mistake. So what if we said 4 and now we have 5? That's just more business for them! If the 5th was a real addition, I'd tell them to go eat at a competitor's. \u00a0The hostess (NOT THE BARTENDER) should have just asked for clarification, not yell at the customer and [figuratively] spit in our faces. People like that bartender give Chinese people a bad name. They should fire him, not only for charging an arm and a leg for cheap alcohol, but for his rudeness and lack of bedside manners. Something tells me he's one of the owners though. Bah.",

The place was definitely authentic and i saw them making the dumplings in the restaurant so I thought they would be great, but sadly it was disappointing. I ordered the xiaolongbao, soup dumplings, and they were just so tiny in comparison to what I've usually had. They tasted great, the flavor was there, but it was so small. I also ended up ordering the roast duck and roast pork with some rice. The roast pork was decent, but it wasn't the real roast pork, if you know what I mean, the texture was off and it it just wasn't the same as what I've had. The \u00a0duck I had was pretty fatty, but the taste was good, albeit a bit greasy. I had high hopes for this place but they fall flat. I've eaten at so msny great Chinese places that this place just didn't compare. The food itself was decent, but it wasnt spectacular or anything to write home about. There are plenty of other places to visit in China Town and I recommend that you do.",

The dumpling chefs were not making dumplings as usual but were sitting behind the glass, reheating the frozen dumplings. The dumplings that are usually heavenly were tasteless and were leaking goopy fatty liquid. Not happy!",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm \"celebrating\" my 200th Qype review with one of my worst dining experiences in London in my 6 years here. Dumpling's Legend is a new restaurant just opened in Chinatown, specialising in a type of Shanghainese dumpling called Xiao Long Bao. The interior is sleek and modern, very neutrally white but feeling a bit soulless. We of course ordered a basket of 8 xiao long baos, and were not disappointed - they were good, although nothing extremely special. Having dined at Leong's Legends round the corner, I think the xiao long bao there are better - with a richer filling and thinner dumpling skin. We also ordered beef noodles and pork chop noodles to go with the dumplings, and were really disappointed with them. When the noodles came they looked pathetic - a big bowl of tasteless broth, with some noodles and limp stalks of vegetables swimming inside. The pork chops were average (again, Leong's Legend was better). The beef soup came in a separate bowl to be poured over the noodles - the bowl was way too hot to lift to pour, so we had to resort to using the spoon to slowly transfer the soup and beef over. Overall, a very disappointing experience, and we shall definitely not be going back again. The noodles gets a 1 star from us - the xiao long bao a 3 star rating - averaging out to two stars.

Not Ding Tai Fun quality but decent for London.Went there few nights ago on a rainy, cold London night trying to decide a new place or going back to this place. It's safe to say that my decision turned out to be the wrong one.Ordered the crab soup dumping. I can tell the dumpling is not freshly made. Given this is 9 pm, I gave they a pass since it still tasted OK. Then the horror begins. Hot and sour soup looked like a bowl of thickened dark vinegar. The string bean with minced pork was way too oily and salty. The only decent dish is the tofu with minced pork.In addition to the bad food, the service was just horrible. I know what to expect from an Asian restaurant, but this is even below par. Don't let the picture of HRH at the entrance fool you. What does a white person know about good Chinese food??",

I think we came in this establishment because we were starving and saw a lot of people sitting by the windows (READ: they purposely seat as much people as possible by the windows to make it seem like they are busy, smart and cunning!). CONS - RUDE service! I asked a waitress what the other table was having and she pointed to an item on the menu and I ordered it (it was an entirely different item by the way). When it came, I told another waitress that was not what we ordered, she kinda just shrugged it off and walked away (we were later charged for the wrongful recommendation). We asked another waitress (third different waitress now if you are keeping track) for extra sauce and she gave us attitude (come on woman, it is just sauce!). Prices were average (as compared to the other dim sum joints around Chinatown that we should have went to instead). The Xiao Long Bao (what they were apparently were known for) was also average. They had a spicy Xiao Long Bao version -- BAD. They basically shoved a spoonful of hot Szechuan peppers (including the numbing spice) with their usual filling and it tasted just spicy with no depth of flavor! CONCLUSION - The scallop rice rolls and quail egg shu mai were decent (but I'm sure I will find better ones in the other dim sum restaurants) but the snotty service will keep me from coming back. Oh, the bathrooms don't have soap so think of all the employees handling your food - RED FLAG!",

It's mostly bland and uninteresting. Crispy noodles and seafood tasted like it was a frozen meal from the market. The roasted meats were ok not great. Dumplings are better from my local shops on Clement Street in San Francisco.In short, go across the street to Golden Dragon. This place isn't worth the trip unless the food is free.",

    "text": "I'm a bit torn on my review for this place. \u00a0The soup dumplings (xiao long bao, or XLB) were decent. \u00a0Just remember that you have to have light fingers and a spoon in hand when handling the XLB without breaking it! And break the dumpling skin just a bit, so you can slurp out the soup - otherwise you will probably sear the skin off the roof of your mouth. \u00a0No, I'm serious. Anyway, their XLB - sure, decent, delicious, soupy and not dry. \u00a0But anything else on the menu? \u00a0Just don't bother. \u00a0Its way overpriced for what you get, and I don't think there were any dinner dishes that were decent. \u00a0The service was quite shoddy as well. \u00a0I don't know how many times we had to flag someone down, only to be ignored.. but when we were able to get our orders in, we had to repeatedly remind them that we were still waiting on something. \u00a0This is my first time having Peking Duck in London, and it was \u00a345. \u00a0I nearly had a heart attack. \u00a0I'm not sure if this is the standard, but seriously... ????? \u00a0I couldn't.. i just couldn't wrap my head around that. \u00a0It better have been some fantastic duck, but it wasn't. There should have been some fresh hand made roti-style pancake to wrap the duck. \u00a0Instead, we were given WON TON wrappers. \u00a0Again. WTF????? \u00a0They are trying to pull one over you if they are giving you wonton wrappers. \u00a0I know others didn't see it as being a big deal. \u00a0Its like ordering an expensive burger, to be given some meat sandwiched in between 2 slices of white bread. \u00a0Or given cheese whiz instead of real cheese. \u00a0Yes, its a big deal.I get that essentially its supposed to be 2 dishes - the second is a lettuce duck wrap. \u00a0Which was so small, that there were only enough for 5-6 people. \u00a0Complete rip off. We also ordered a bucket of rice, should have been the equivelent of around 6'ish packed bowls of rice. \u00a0We had to ask 3 times, then it finally came at the END of dinner, in a large sized soup bowl. \u00a0We ended up being charged \u00a326 for that. 26 !!!!!!!! \u00a0around 2.50 per person, and we had 11 people. \u00a0But I know for a fact, there's no way there were 11 bowls of rice in that bowl. \u00a0Total kick in the face. \u00a0I'd rather go elsewhere for food, and for XLB for that matter.",

The turnip dumplings were definitely the best I ever had, and the beef hofun really hit the spot. Two friends had the set menu, which looked ok but with rather small portions. However, we weren't given the time of day for at least 20 minutes after we were seated. I tried to catch the eyes of various waiters - smiling, glancing, waving - on a number of occasions; what finally did it was all of us standing up and preparing to leave (which brought over the manager right quick but unapologetic). As delicious as the dumplings were, the whole place put a bad taste in my mouth.",

Apparently my husband has been eating them for years when he goes to San Francisco on business, so he was all smooth and suav\u00e9 about it, all Mr. Professional XLB Eater Man. Dude has been holding out on me. I'm not gonna say these are the most authentic and delicious soup dumplings in London, because I have nothing to compare them to. But I can tell you that I wrestled down 11 of them on my own, no problem. I can tell you that they are full of a fresh ginger/lemongrass/pork flavor that makes them an absolute delight to eat. I can also tell you that I will absolutely be going back, because those little dumplings full of piping-hot soupy goodness are going to haunt my dreams until I have more.",

The grilled pork dumpling was also great, although I'd have to admit it was more pan fried than grilled. Stick to the dim sum and you'll be happy. My chinese dish of chicken stir-fry with chili and lemongrass was just ok. Price are reasonable most dumplings (they seem to come 3 to a plate) cost between 2 and 3 pounds, and mains are between 7 and 10 pounds. Not bad for lunch!Service is friendly but a bit slow, however, the overall place was spotless---very clean and bright. A great break from the chinatown crowds.Ask to be seated upstairs if you want a quieter dining experience!",

We ordered only dim sum. Started with wanton soup. Broth tasted like dishwater, no flavor. Colored water. Wantons large but not cooked enough. \u00a0All the other dishes were under cooked. The barbecue pork buns were over flavored with hoisin sauce and undercooked. The Chang-fen with prawn , again undercooked. The Cantonese shrimp dumplings. Same issue. Fell apart trying to serve. Minced pork and crab soup-Mai tasted like shrimp instead and pork undercooked and grizzly. Perhaps in their haste to get food to many customers, did not bother to finish cookingOther customers who did not order dim sum looked like they were having a better experience.

Mgr was very rude about the situation and said we had to order food from the main menu on top of the dim sum menu.. so instead of causing a scene I told her to her face out loud that this was unexceptionable and I've never been anywhere in the world where I was treated this way.

When you have a steady stream of willing tourist victims, oops I mean customers, the urgency \u00a0for top class cuisine and value for money isn't the highestTo be fair, they do live up to their restaurant name. Perhaps to call their dumplings legendary is stretching it a bit but they were definitely the best part of our meal. The xiao loong bao had thin skin encasing the soup, which was flavoursomeSadly, this was the highlight of our meal. The Peking duck promised much as it was carved tableside in the traditional way. The skin was served with pancakes, cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce. The meat was fried up but there was only a tiny amount to share between usThe main dishes were forgettable but the real kick came when the bill arrived. \u00a345 for Peking duck and the extortionate amount we were charged for rice means this tourist trap only scores 2 stars",

This restaurant specialises in dim sum and other types of dumplings (I love the cheung fun type) but also offers some decent mains. The place is popular with Londoners and tourists alike, and there's loads of Chinese people eating there, which must be a good sign.The only downside of Dumplings' Legend is the chaotic service. Be prepared to get your order mixed up, reorder, ask where your food is several times. We got the bill before getting what we had ordered: they thought we'd already finished, they thanked us for our visit and asked if we wanted to pay cash or credit card. I said: I want my dim sums first! LOL",

Not the best I have ever had but they are still pretty satisfying. All of the pork pastries are perfect hangover cures. \u00a0The cheung fun is moreish. Etc etc. The chilli sauce is also good. This is important. The only thing I had ordered so far that has been 'challenging' was the duck balls found under 'dumplings'. For the adventurist eater only ( I was a fan). \u00a0I really don't think you can go wrong though. They have all sorts of lunch special '2-4-1's with dumpling dishes and drinks.

The whole concept of the store reminds me about Din Tai Fung with a show-kitchen where you can see people filling your dumplings...this is really cool.Like I said: soup dumplings have been very good both times. In fact, they're actually quite soupy and the flavour is also very good. As for the rest of the dishes...let's put it this way: they should stick with making dumplings!What is really off-putting as well is the amount of tourists that come into this place...it just feels like a factory more than a true local place. The whiteness of the clientele is then only exasperated by the awful white interior. In fact, I was here with two Asian architects, who simply could not help but complain about the awful design!So, let me recap: do go here for the soup dumplings (xiao long bao)...and maybe also have a couple of appetizers, but I cannot really recommend any main dishes...",

I know, you might be thinking why bother with them, but if you're with a veggie that wants to see what the fuss is about, this won't really demonstrate anything other than a mild disappointment. The spicy pork wontons were good, not Szechuan or Taiwanese hot, but kind of British hot. It's alright but I'd be hard-pressed to say it's my favourite around.",

They were American (I am American). A French mother and daughter two tables away from us as well as this table of American men repeatedly flagged down the waiters for waiting a long time for food. \u00a0I thought they was just unfamiliar in the ways of Chinese service, nope!Our food began arriving because I ordered all over the menu. However, it became apparent that the complaints of my fellow patrons were true. First off, the runners couldn't even tell us what they were dropping off and argued that a dish on the table was tripe. Tripe is my religion. My boyfriend knows tripe--he's basically a butcher. That wasn't even the same color or texture as tripe. I returned from the bathroom and my boyfriend tells me the two guys next to us left and it was a huge drama because they refused to pay for any of their food or drinks because they waiting over an hour and their dim sum never came. Around this point, the mother and daughter received theirs, they waited more than an hour and unfortunately only ordered one type of dim sum.2 hours into our experience, 4 dishes hadn't arrived. But! This new server came out of nowhere. He was so lively and friendly compared to the woman who took our drink order and actively avoided everyone in the dining room despite being the only server on our floor. I asked him if the plate in front of me (we tried to eat it but it was so dry and cold), was tripe. He laughed and said no! And very quickly and efficiently took that and our missing food items off the bill. THEY STILL HADN'T EVEN MADE THEM--otherwise we would've boxed them. He saved our entire experience. He even said not to worry about the service charge. No man, you deserve all the service charges. That second star is just for him. And we will probably give this place another shot because he was so great.",

While waiting you can already check out the small dumpling-kitchen where thousands of dumplings must be made daily.The menu is a bit confusing and not completely consistent with the DIY order list but if you don't know what or how to order just ask the staff. If you want something special and you know the name but you cannot find it on the menu just ask and probable they will just bring it. It would actually help if you know a bit \u00a0what you want or otherwise just try to be seated next to some (Chinese) locals and copy ;-)I was graving for dumplings so only had a nice variety of the fresh dumplings but I will definitely come back soon to try the dumpling soups and the steamed filled buns which looked amazing at our neighbours tables.",

When we arrived it was a little early, the restaurant was far from being full. We were three people and they sat us in a table for five, which was fine for us. A little after we ordered the food and received our drinks they asked us to move tables, but to a table that could barely fit two people. In our previous table they sat a group of six kids, and from their look I can assure they were not happy, it was obviously too small. The dumplings were OK, I have had better dumplings there in the past so I was not very impressed. Location wise, the place is great, right in the middle of Chinatown and only a few blocks from Leicester Square station.",

As per usual, don't expect incredible service, but the food here is really good, their Xiao Long Baos are probably some of the best in London and if you pay by cash on most days at lunch etc, you get 15% discount (which effectively knocks off the service charge). The XLB's are tasty, fresh (you see them rolling them out in the window), packed with flavour and you get a fair few in one order. The crayfish ones are really good, but you can't go wrong with their classic pork. Just remember, all in one bite! Don't try and do it in halves because then you'll get precious bao juice all over yourself you messy pup! Service is fast, efficient though not particularly happy or friendly. But really, what did you expect? But probably most importantly, is they present you with a genuine receipt. Like, fully itemised, and not just a couple of wiggles on their classic order paper. You'll never get ripped off again! Yay!",

If you, like myself, like to eat a lot, I would suggest getting a couple of the mains to share with your group as well.The only drawbacks were that they did forget to bring one of the dishes and we eventually canceled it and also that the music was on repeat (there's only so many times I can listen to Let it Go in one sitting).

I have been here several times and have always been super impressed with the food. The food is beyond excellent. This place is famous for their dim sum and dumplings, which are very good. I usually get the crystal prawn, and their broth infused dumplings in the spicy pork. Beware though! When eating the broth infused ones you have to gobble it down in one bite otherwise you will get it all over yourself! I also like to get the crispy duck and pancakes, and I'll admit that this dish isn't the best you'll find in Chinatown but its still lovely. The chinese broccoli is also a top dish for me, as well as the pumpkin and prawn dish which is totally different from anything you would find at other places.The venue is so clean its virtually spotless. Everything is white and clean and the glass partition where the dim sum makers work is wiped down several times a day and is always looking great. This is such a nice change from the other places in Chinatown, which seem a bit moldy with old sticky carpet floors. This place is also huge and I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes to be seated.The service could be better, but its not any worse than the other places in Chinatown which aren't exactly known for their exceptional service. You do have to hail down your waitor, and be very clear when you order otherwise you will get the wrong thing. But all in all this is totally worth it as the dim sum, dumplings, and everything else there is incredible.Tip: Order the fresh squeezed apple juice, they literally squash an entire apple into the cup and it comes out all foamy and fresh.",

One of the less externally scary looking places in London's small Chinatown for those of you that may not appreciate hole-in-the-wall ethnic foodie dining experiences. Inside it is clean, modern, bright and even a little hip with some artsy images on the wall and music playing with a vibrant beat. The staff speak passable English (and while this is really not a great sign for an authentic Chinese dining experience, it is, after all, located in the heart of London so it is necessary), the menu has a fair amount of interesting dishes including a list of about 120 dim sum items and noodle soups. I had prawn and chive dumplings and a clay pot rice with minced pork and salted fish. The food is tasty but a bit more expensive than some of the other dim sum places in the area and the real reason I am not as enthusiastic about this place as I should be is that they did not have steamed tripe on their dim sum list. I love that dish and use it as a baseline to measure dim sum joints around the world. It is a very basic, readily available \"famine food\" (offal made delicious so poor people would eat it during tough times) dim sum dish and this is he only dim sum spot I have ever been to where it is not available. If they start offering tripe, this place goes to 4 stars.",

We ordered xiao long bao, prawn dumplings and half an aromatic duck.The xiao long bao was mildly disappointing. The soup was thick and slightly bland. The pork was as expected. One order came with 8 dumplings for \u00a38.The prawn dumplings were mediocre, nothing exceptional yet still very satisfying. One order also came with 8 dumplings for \u00a38.Surprisingly, the duck was the best part of the meal. It was crunchy and extremely flavorful. I'd compare it to carnitas in texture. Accompanied with thin pancakes, cucumbers, green onions and brown sauce, it was just an amazing amalgamation of flavors.The service was great, very quick and friendly. Price point was also great, I can't complain about 8 dumplings for \u00a38. But considering we went here to try some of the best dumplings in London, I can't say my expectations were met. For better and cheaper dumplings, I'd recommend going to one of the smaller dim sum shops right down the street.",

We saw that this place was full of people so we decided to give it a try.Food: We ordered the Spicy Pork Siu Loung Bao, steamed prawn dumplings and Shanghai-Style Fried Noodles. The spicy pork Siu Loung Bao was nothing more than chili sauce and it was way too watery. The steamed prawn was the best of the three but the skin was thicker than I would have liked. The shanghai-style fried noodles was over sauced.Service: Outside the door said \"10% off the bill of you pay with cash Monday-Thursday.\" We asked the waitress about it and got an eye roll. We paid for meal in cash and got multiple one pound change. We then went to get dessert at a near by place and tried to use to the change we received. We found out that the change was older currency and they would not accept it. So, we did get the 10% only to be SCAMMED a few pounds. Terrible service is one thing, but you can tell they aren't very trustworthy people by the way they acted. Price: Overpriced subpar chinese food that you pay for sitting in a nicer restaurant. This place didn't impress us and we don't appreciate them giving us old currency. I don't recommend this place at all. Don't be fooled that this place always looks full. There are plenty of other food options nearby.",

The rest of the story: I came here because I wanted Xiao Long Bao and the place I love (Beijing Dumpling) was actually sold out. I should have just gone without. I ordered the shrimp toast, the crispy duck and one order each of their 4 varieties of XLB. The shrimp toast was ok. The duck was so over cooked and dry that I sent it back. But the real sin was the XLB - about 1/3 we're broken when they brought them. The rest were literally touching each other so you couldn't remove one without breaking the one next to it. Out of 32 Bao I found 6 with soup in them. If you don't know XLB the whole stinking point is that there is soup in them!In a neighborhood with close to 100 Chinese restaurants, you can safely skip this one.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that Xiao Long Bao is my LIFE so I have extremely high standards for it. I'm not entirely sure about the standards of XLB in London so I'm definitely surprised to hear that Dumplings' Legend offers some of the best in London after my meal.I haven't tried other XLB to compare but I'm sure this city must have more amazing XLB to show! Overall - 4 stars because the XLB were great, don't get me wrong, but they weren't out of this world and this city definitely deserves better!~ Atmosphere:Incredibly hectic. The place was packed FULL, overall not too pleasant of an atmosphere to eat in.~ Customer Service:I've had a different experience to other reviewers - the customer service here is great. Very attentive and quick with their service. The food came out at the speed of light.~ Food:We ordered both pork and pork and crab XLB - both of them were really great and juicy, but the broth inside was just OK. I much preferred the pork and crab to the pork-only because the crab added an extra dimension of flavour that took their XLB to the next level. Overall, I liked their Xiao Long Bao but if you're a self-proclaimed XLB connoisseur like me you should keep searching.Downsides: Ordered their custard buns, it wasn't custard but salted duck yolk (which I like, but definitely not custard so I don't know why they advertised it as such). Also, they don't offer Chinese hot oil at all unfortunately, only soy sauce and vinegar. Not too great if you're into hot oil like I am.---I like Dumplings Legend. I would say that they're more of a 3.5 stars, but I'm happy to bump it up to a 4 because I don't think it's quite there to justify a 3. The food was great and I'd definitely come back here again, but the search for the best XLB in London continues on.",

The bottom would rip, the soup would come out, and we'd be left with just some filling and ripped dumpling dough.On the flipside, the staff was friendly.The hot and sour soup was okay, a bit too sweet.If you're in a pinch, don't feel like waiting, and want some Chinese food, this place will do the trick, but I can't really recommend it beyond that.",

These could be the best xiao long bao i have ever tried (definately better than shanghai) comaparble to hong kong quality. The other food was good too. Highly recommended. We drove over 60 miles for this treat.",

    "text": "There are so many choices on the main street in Chinatown, that if a restaurant is slightly not up to the rest of the bunch's standards, it is very noticeable. Dumpling Legend is one of the restaurants looking pricey/pretentious on the outside, and when you take a closer look at the menu you'd perhaps gulp and think about how your wallet would suffer if you were to have a filling meal. With all the other competition around, it is difficult to stand out from the crowd. Dumpling Legend has achieved this by a modern, high class looking exterior and eye-popping prices of food. Chinese food is not cheap when it's in a serviced restaurant. Especially Chinese food in Chinatown which is most authentic compared to your local Chinese takeaway. Yet I do not see the reason of visiting Dumpling Legend when you can walk opposite and go in any other Chinese restaurants (which to be fair, look much more authentic). I feel that Dumpling Legend would like to market itself as top end Chinese (fusion) restaurant. But any person who eats out in Chinatown often can tell you that the more 'ghetto' places are perhaps more tasty with reasonable prices. If it is a special occasion that you are celebrating, DL could be a good choice, with a sophisticated decor and everything, and perhaps a less authentic menu (more like fusion). But otherwise I would urge to try out some other Chinese restaurants in that area.",

    "text": "For photos and more:http://hungryinlondon.com/2011/02/dumpling-legend-chinatown/ \u00a0In celebration of the Chinese New Year I met Mr. Noodles and some other friends at Dumpling Legend in Chinatown. This evening turned out to be not only a feast of some delicious and some not so great food, but was also hugely educational as I learned a lot from Mr. Noodles about Chinese culture, food and restaurants. Dumpling Legend which is located in the heart of Chinatown has opened some time last year and specialises, as the name promises, in dumplings. To experience the extensive dim sum menu, you have to come before 5 pm (dim sum are traditionally eaten for breakfast and lunch). I refer you to this mouth-watering review by Greedy Diva for more information about eating dim sum at Dumpling Legend. The restaurant is extremely brightly lit. This is good for taking pictures but not that flattering for teint and wrinkles (not that I have any of course!), so I would not necessarily recommend it for the first or second date to be honest. The menu depicts a happy Chinese dumpling with a little crown. Without wanting to be mean, if I had a restaurant I would not entrust my marketing campaign to the people who created this cheerful ball reminiscent of an onion As Mr. Noodles and I are both working hard in our non-blogging related day jobs to be able to afford eating out all the time, we only managed to meet up in the evening and therefore had to choose from the evening menu with a limited dim sum selection. Mr. Noodles pointed out that Dumpling Legend does not appear to specialise in a speficic Chinese cuisine, as the dishes on the menu stemmed from Canton, Sichuan, Malaysia and Taiwan. Mr. Noodles chose the dishes. He ordered a very interesting mix of starters and mains, however, we got them served all at the same time. I didn't like this at all. Firstly, you expect dishes to be served one after the other when they are stated as 'starter' and 'main' in the menu (otherwise why bother doing this?) and secondly, we really had to rush to eat everything while it was still hot/warm. The meal therefore started with a huge minus for Dumpling Legend In summary, the dishes were a rather mixed bag of delicious, OK and not very good. The supposed starters: I rather enjoyed the Cucumber in Chilli Oil (\u00a34) which is a typical Sichuan dish. The fresh and cold cucumber and the hotness of the sauce provided an interesting contrast. The Sweet Potato Fried with Salted Egg Yolk (\u00a34.50) did not taste very Chinese in my opinion and was strangely addictive. Somehow reminded me of the zucca fritta at Zucca. Very successful were the Sichuan-style Spicy Won-ton (\u00a34.50). The delicious savoury filling was wrapped into light won ton skin and came with plenty of mouth-tingling chili sauce. We did fight a little over those A real Chinese specialty are the Pork Crab Meat Siu Loung Bao (\u00a36.50). When I ate Siu Long Baos for the first time at Leong's Legend I burnt my mouth terribly as this type of dim sum contains not only solid fillings but also hot soup. The version at Dumpling Legends did not look very pretty but tasted heavenly. Mr. Noodles taught me how to eat them and I want to share this knowledge with you to save you from injury. You grab one of the dumplings with your chopsticks and bite into it holding it over one of the big Chinese spoons. Then you can enjoy the dumpling and afterward savour the soup collected in the spoon. A real disappointment were the Steamed Prawn Dumplings (\u00a36). Again they did not look very appealing but in this case this also applied to the taste. The skin was too thick and the filling tasteless. Stay away from these! The dishes we had wanted as mains:I have never eaten Taiwanese Three-cup Chicken (with soy sauce, sesame oil & rice wine) (\u00a39.50) so I did not have much comparison but for Mr Noodles this was the most disappointing part of the meal. According to him, this dish, if done well, is extraordinarily delicious. This one clearly wasn't. The chicken was kind of slimy, the sauce tasted only of soy sauce and I could not pick up any sesame oil. Overall this dish lacked any redeeming qualities. You wouldn't think that something as delicious as the Seabass Fillet Steamed with Soy Sauce (\u00a317.50) can come from the same kitchen as the unsuccessful 3 Cup Chicken: Wonderfully tender sea bass with Chinese spring onions and ginger in a light and tasty soy broth was my favourite dish of the evening. I had a similarly delectable Chinese sea bass at Goldfish City close to Bank. The other two mains clearly did not rock my boat. The Stir-fried Choi-sum with Garlic (\u00a37.80) was not too bad but did not leave any lasting impression. Celebrating the Chinese New Year you have to eat noodles as noodles represent longevity. Also when you go out with Mr Noodles you have to eat noodles, but I think you would have guessed that much :) . The Fried Wide Rice Noodles with Beef (\u00a37.50) were boring and insipid. I mixed them with the chili sauce coming with",

At first glance, it seemed a few notches above your regular Chinatown restaurant, then you go in and there's nothing unique about it. It's just all white.It was 5 PM, and we wanted dimsum. You can almost be sure, you're not getting much in terms of quality / freshness in Chinatown. Here was one place that proved it totally wrong. I suppose it can be argued, that's because the dimsum was on the starters menu.The grilled gyoza was somewhat dry but OK. I'm not a gyoza fan. Then came the soupy dumplings. Super fresh, delicious, adequately stuffed, nicely souped. Very well priced at \u00a36 - 8 for 8 pieces. The shrimp/crab/pork and combination dumplings are all super. A portion of spare ribs looked like a bad case of sweet and sour pork fried dollops. Tasted exactly like that. Avoid.The thing to remember is soupy dumplings, especially after hours.Service, non existent. But then it's Chinatown. You have to yell out to get service, follow up to get your order on time and exercise some aggression to get the check when you realize you've been waiting for over 15 minutes and now you're actually getting late.",

For those that haven't come across these little delights before, they originate from Shanghai with a minced pork filling. Contained within the wrapping is also some soup, keeping the meat moist. The trick with these is to eat them hot, with a little bit of vinegar and not lose any of the soup whilst picking them up! As the wrapping is quite thin and delicate, this can be quite a task!We had the pork and crab meat one - definitely recommended. We also had some other items that weren't dumpling related and they're nothing to write home about. Would definitely recommend the dumplings at this place, but if you want a full meal with other foods, not so much.",

What I think was Fried Vermicelli Noodles & Hofen with mixed seafood and scrambled eggs had a few hard, uncooked bits, and the sauce was over-gooey - that dish did not impress me.

The skin though thick enough to withstand pressure from chopsticks, yet it is thin enough that you don't just eat a mouthful of pastry skin. The xiao long pao was not spicy at all for me but otherwise is quite delectable. just love to try new dishes with intriguing names and this was the least adventurous dish that I was able to convinced my dining friend to try. Not knowing what to expect, I was looking forward to it. The dish reminded me of the butterfly prawns dish that I eat in Malaysia which is one of my favourites so I really like it.

Xiao Long Bao are large steamed dumplings - a bit like classic dim-sum \u00a0with the robust and earthy flavours of salted pork, turnip and spring onions. There were many Chinese diners there, often young, but also prosperous and (I imagine) either students or workers in Chinese enterprises setting up in London. That's the sort of place Dumplings' Legend is \u00a0at once homely, but also aspirational in style \u00a0an expression of where China is at now.We ate there in the evening so used the evening menu, but I gather there is also a good dim-sum menu earlier in the day.Food & ServiceWe were pleasantly dealt with and seated after a few minutes (the restaurant was v. busy). Unfortunately we were seated right next to the washing up station for small porcelain bowls and spoons \u00a0the noise! That small negative aside, the food more than redeemed our faith on choosing Dumplings' Legend.We started with cucumber in chilli and Sichuan style WonTon \u00a0both delicious beyond belief and a masterclass in blending various types of soy sauce, sugar and oils to create super flavoursome relishes. We moved on to Venison in Ginger Wine, Malaysian style Chicken Curry, Salt and Pepper Tofu (stuffed with minced prawn), and Choi Sum with garlic \u00a0with one bowl of rice between us. All the dishes were delicious and a world away from the brightly coloured sticky pastes that seem to pass for 'Chinese' food in indifferent places across the land. This food absolutely sang with flavours.We washed the lot down with Orange Juice and Mineral Water.We didn't try the Xiao Long Bao, we will next time though :-)FacilitiesI can see what's being reached for here \u00a0a kind of modern Chinese aesthetic; clean, modern and confident. And by and large that is what the facilities are, but there is a sense of things starting to look worn (stair carpet) and cluttered (all those notices haphazardly stuck to the walls at the waiters' ordering terminals). What's needed is a Mary Portas style ruthless makeover \u00a0keeping the best of what is there and improving what isn't so good. Toilets are upstairs so not disabled friendly, and access to the restaurant is up three steps too (no ramp).PriceWe paid approx \u00a332 each \u00a0not expensive, not cheap \u00a0but a fair price for what we had. We didn't feel we had been taken advantage of.OverallI like this place. I will go back to try the Xiao Long Bao and soups!",

I went with two friends for dinner a couple of days ago and I was left more than slightly disappointed. Given that the place was named after dumplings, I was eager to order some to show my friends what traditional Chinese dumplings were like. To my disappointment, they didn't have dumplings on the menu, instead they had Xiao Long Baos, which are stuffed Shanghai buns. Was it that difficult to get the name right? Dumplings are dumplings and buns are buns, they are different things. Dumplings originated from Beijing whilst Xiao Long Baos are from Shanghai, they made in completely different ways. It's like calling a haggis a Cumberland sausage this has already got me started on the wrong note. I scanned down the menu and was left confused because most of the dishes were Cantonese, but there were some Malay curries and some Szechuan cold starters. I really didn't know what to order, so I suggested we order something my friends haven't tried before. So we ordered vegetarian Xiao Long Baos, drunken chicken, Malay chicken curry and a vegetable dish. To be fair, the vegetarian Xiao Long Baos were nice \u00a0they were well made, nicely seasoned and had tasty filling. But rest of the dishes were just bog standard China town. I had hoped with the opening of places like Bar Shu and Empress of Szechuan (though both Szechuan style food) signalled the arrival of more authentic Chinese food but Legend just felt like a step backwards. (sigh.) To finish the meal off, when the bill came it was headed Golden Harvest \u00a0seriously could you get anymore careless I at least expected the name on the bill to say 'Dumplings Legend' not the old Chinese restaurant that was once here and had shut down two years ago! My friends were left unimpressed too and had set me a challenge for a better suggestion next time \u00a0sorry!",

    "text": "For pictures, see Greedy Diva @http://greedydiva.blogspot.com/2010/11/dumplings-legend-chinatown.html  Sometimes you just need to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon eating dim sum. Last week, I wrote about Leong's Legends, a decent Taiwanese restaurant in Chinatown which recently opened a dim sum offshoot, Dumplings' Legend, just around the corner on Gerrard Street. Reading comments on my post about LL's excellent Siu Loung Bao (or Xiao Long Bao) brought on cravings. It was time to investigate the newbie's offerings. On the site of the former Golden Harvest, the downstairs room is large and airy with white walls and minimalistic touches. It's fresher looking than some of its neighbours - quite like an Asian St John's in terms of decor. We were lucky to be seated at the front, where the whole wall is a window and the sunshine flitted in over our lunch as we watched the characters of Chinatown amble by. Upstairs is more poky, but does the job. We arrived about 2pm - prime time it seems. The dining room was packed and a small queue was growing rapidly. However, 3 dumpling makers were at work behind a glass panel at the entrance, rolling, folding and stuffing delicate dumpling wrappers. It's mesmerising to watch while you wait - although I do wonder how long it takes before RSI sets in. \"Whatever\", you say. To the food, the food... Our knobbly cheung-fun arrive first - three generous, slinky, slug-like noodles stuffed with ample slices of sea bass and picked vegetables. A fair price at \u00a33.30. The next table orders the spicy stir fried cheung-fun which looks good and appears to be a popular choice around the room. Steamed sticky rice in a bamboo tube is delicious but so thick it borders on congealed - a decent set of biceps is required to scoop it out (\u00a34.50). Barbecued pork buns are excellent - fluffy and filled with big, juicy splashes of sweet, red barbecued meat (3 for \u00a32.50). Crystal prawn dumplings are small, pretty things, sweet and plump - but nothing which stands out above the norm here (\u00a32.50). Chicken wrapped in banana leaf with Chinese is a highlight - deliciously moist, with satisfying chunks of chicken and Chinese sausage (\u00a32.20). Finally, out come the pork Siu Loung Bao, for which Leong's Legends are renowed (\u00a36.00). At Dumplings' Legend, they're also fantastic - the little smurf's hut shaped wrapper is quite delicate and so you have to be careful not to pierce it, spilling broth onto the table. It snuggles a parcel of meat within as well as a warm soupy broth which explodes into your mouth on first bite. These should be an essential part of your dim sum order here. The accompanying soy sauce contains thick slithers of shredded ginger - a lovely touch. We finish with a serve of 3 tiny egg tarts (\u00a32.20) - these are TPG's thing more than mine. They're nothing special, but I quite like the fact they don't taste overly eggy, Service is efficient and friendlier than you might experience at some Chinatown restaurants. We paid around \u00a315 per head including tea and service, although we could have done with 1 less dish and 1 less pot of tea (at \u00a32.20 each) had we not been feeling so greedy. Both Leong's Legends and Dumplings' Legend highlight their \"highly recommended\" dishes with 2 stars on the menu. Interestingly, \"Legends specialties\" are distinguished with 1 star. I'm not sure what the distinction means. Dumplings' Legend is good, and it's already popular. I think it may become my cheap and cheerful dim sum restaurant of choice when those Sunday afternoon cravings set in.",

No one really wanted to deal with it and kinda looked not bothered. The place might look nice but definitely staff need to be better training.",
