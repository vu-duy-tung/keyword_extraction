    "text": "Probably the best fish & chips I've ever had! We were actually heading to Turner & Roast for sandwiches, and our cab drove right past Poppies, which I had also bookmarked since it is highly recommended for their fish & chips. Since we only had one sandwich at T&R, we decided to split an order of fish & chips at Poppies. There was a small line when we got there around 7:30pm on a Saturday, but we were sat within 10 minutes. They also have a separate take-out order line, and a lot of people were going that route. There is a small bench outside to eat your food if you prefer. We ordered:-Large Cod Supper (Fried in Groundnut Oil, Served w/Chips & Homemade Tartar Sauce, \u00a312.50, yelp.com/biz_photos/popp\u2026): Delicious! The large order was HUGE, and I wouldn't be able to finish this on my own. The fish was perfectly cooked, and super crunchy outside but nice and flaky inside. The chips were also delicious, and had a nice crisp. You can't skimp on the salt though. I also really liked the homemade tartar sauce, but had to ask them for more since they give you so little. A must order!-Roll & Butter (\u00a31.50/each, yelp.com/biz_photos/popp\u2026): The roll was really soft, and comes already buttered. Good, but nothing special.-Cartmel Sticky Toffee Pudding (Served w/Scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, \u00a34.60, yelp.com/biz_photos/popp\u2026): Delicious, and a must order! The sticky toffee pudding comes out nice and warm, and goes really well with the scoop of cold ice cream. Overall, I had a great meal at Poppies, and this is a must stop if you are in London and like fish and chips!",

    "text": "It's been two years since my first visit to Poppies in Shoreditch/Spitalfields. Well, two years later and I'm still a fan. My friends and I needed a quick lunch and walked from our flat off Brick Lane. We arrived a bit after lunch time and asked if we could get a table without a reservation. We were glad to be able to get a table. The staff greeted us warmly and sat us at a table in the back of the restaurant, which quickly filled up with others. I chose to order fish and chips, preferring the Haddock to the Cod but was told they were out of Haddock. So, I switched to Cod. I then ordered a Fentiman's Ginger Beer... but the server gave me a sheepish grin and said with regret that they were out of that too. \u00a0I laughed and switched to a Victorian Lemonade. Well, everything was just as delightful was it was two years ago. It was nice to not be \"under the weather\" (I had the flu, btw) and to be able to taste my food more fully. I can imagine that I'll be back to Poppies when I'm back in London.",

When I came there was a bit of line but I didn't wait that long and we ordered before we sat down and the food came quickly once we were settled. We ordered the seafood platter and haddock fish 'n chips. I was a bit let down because the chips were no longer warm. It was just mildly warm. The fish and seafood were great so had no complaint on that. But the chips were ordinary and rather dismaying. We ordered desserts but unfortunately they were ran out of the pudding and apple pie. So we were left with ice creams, chocolate and strawberry flavors. They were just ordinary but I thought the strawberry was better than the chocolate. They are said to be the champion of national fish 'n' chips competition 2014 but I can tell you there is another place I would choose to get my perfect fish 'n chips.",

Meh.The beer was basically water (camden pale ale), but I guess that's just me having trouble with the British taste, although a wider selection wouldn't hurt.What really bothered me was the live band: don't get me wrong, they were really talented, simply the dining room was too small and the volume too high, resulting in an annoying experience where it was impossible to exchange even a few words.An ok experience overall, but I can't recommend the place.",

The fishmonger has an excellent eye for fish. I had the old staple Cod and Chips. The Cod was clearly fresh and the batter was light and complimented the fish well. No grease or oil in sight. Chips were crisp outside and done just right inside. The oil used must be replaced regularly as the restaurant did not smell of old oil and the food was fresh. In addition I couldn't resist the Mushy Peas - home made & tasty.This was one of the few times I've seen Ginger Beer on the menu - also a worthy choice.The d\u00e9cor is a throw back to the 50's and 60's as was the sweet selection presented with the bill - Black Jacks and Fruit Salad!Visit soon.I'll be back!",

But ends up, this was everything I ever wanted in fish and chips. Crunchy batter breading on fresh, big pieces of cod, and chips/fries that were a delight to behold and to bite into. Seriously - I think they were made of Yukon Golds or some other kind of rich, silky potato, because they fell apart after the crunch layer like creamy mashed potatoes. Delectable, and worthy of knocking off my Ireland travels for the best fish and chips for those fries alone. Mushy peas were nice and green tasting. I do wish they'd made their own tartar sauce instead of using Heinz and that they didn't charge for ketchup (Really? When it's already $13+ for a quick platter to eat on the street? And WAY more to eat at a table), but I can't really knock a working formula.",

However, my wife and I were unfortunately disappointed. We ordered two large Haddock dinners with chips and a starter of Calamari. The fish was mushy and the outside was not crisp. It did not seem fresh. The chips were not hot and crisp. We think the food was prepared ahead of time and not at the time of our order. The Calamari rings also had a musty taste. Despite the reputation, the food experience was lacking. It was not one of our favorite meals in London.",

The halibut is dryer than the cod but both are equally delicious. The chips (fries) were good as they came fresh out of the fryer. When I first saw how the chips looked like, it looked pretty basic. But they come out piping out of the fryer. It's not as oily as other fish and chips and they don't use much batter so you're still getting the good amount of fried batter to the fish. You also don't feel too heavy from the fried fish or get that oily feeling. Compared to fish and chips in California, fish and chips here are way better. Tip: The take away menu is cheaper than dining in.",

I shared a hot seafood platter with my friends so we could try a bit of everything. It came with cod bites, scampi, calamari, and whitebait. The whitebait was a bit too fishy for us, we all enjoyed the cod the most. We also had haddock n chips and chicken pie and definitely way too much food for the night.

I thought they literally served fish with potato chips. I can't compare to other fish and chips joint since this was my first and last experience. It's just deep fried fish..not sure what the huge deal is. They also charge for sauce - lame. On the plus side, the fish wasn't dry! We ordered the smallest size and it was still too big for the two of us.",

This place not only specializes in just that, but has loads of great reviews and a line out the door...the question is WHY exactly? The table seating is tight as hell (we were basically sharing a table with the guys next to us so we eventually ended up merging conversations with them) and the food was definitely bland. We of course ordered the fish n chips, the seafood appetizer (all fried), and some mushy peas. Nothing to write home about and it took all three sauces to make them palatable. The peas tasted like something I would feed my 18 month old twins (if I was mad at them in life) and the batter was unsalted. Beer selection was decent and the service was decent (you get licorice with your bill) but I felt like all the tourists around us were in the same confused boat wishing we had caught some different fish.",

My friend got the chicken, which was okay, but not the best recommended thing on here. Would definitely get the fish and chips if you're going here.This is a stand that doesn't have anywhere to sit, so you have to find a seat which can be kind of hectic. I thought it was kind of ridiculous they charged extra for ketchup and tarter sauce, but maybe that's a UK thing. Overall, good place to grab fish and chips in London.",

    "text": "I had to try the ubiquitous fish and chips during my stay in London so why not go to the best? Poppies!I entered and found myself cordoned off in to a small space for takeout orders. I'm not sure what is required to sit in the dining room but I didn't qualify, since I wanted the food to go anyway. I then ordered the basic fish and chips with cod, which I believe is the default. Shockingly, they had run out of chips but I was good with that since I figured I'd be getting fresh ones.After paying, more folks came in just seeking chips so we all kind of crammed in this space. One of the gentleman was clearly wasted and was wearing a stuffed turkey on his head. I kid you not. Apparently, this is a thing if you are drunk and in London? Or not. Either way, it was hilarious and the shop keepers didn't know what to make of it. \"Gobble! Gobble!\" I said enthusiastically. Then, he claimed it was a chicken and not a rooster. Rather than starting a huge argument about bird identification, I went with it.I then ordered some mushy peas but everyone there simultaneously said this was a bad idea! F it, I said. I've never had mushy peas before so I'm going to have some now. They are a brilliant steaming green pile of, get this, mushy peas. Perhaps I should have listened but when I tried them later, they really weren't bad.I got salt and malt vinegar on my fish and chips because they were offered and I figured, why not?! As I ate them back in the apartment, the vinegar was a definite plus flavor-wise but it helped make the chips soggy which isn't a good thing. I \u00a0clearly needed more salt which helped. Fresh black pepper helped also because, let's face it, there isn't a lot of flavor in fish and chips.So, now I've eaten the finest of London's fish and chips. I can't honestly say I'm a fan but I'm happy to have done it and I'll now move on with my life.",

My BF is a foodie and hearing him talk about Poppies during his time in London made me really curious. My friends and I decided to find Poppies in our second night in London. We got to the place late so they were out on a lot of the items on the menu; luckily, the cod wasn't one of them. We all got the regular size cod and chips. The cod was yummy, perfectly battered and cooked perfectly to golden brown. My friend thought it was the best fish and chips he ever had! The homemade tartar sauce was yummy, but I still think Andria's seafood in Ventura is the best homemade tartar sauce I've had. I thought it was cute that they serve their ketchup and tartar sauce in the tiny little jars. Sticky toffee pudding with ice cream was yummy! I only had a small taste because I don't really care for dessert, but their toffee pudding was better than what I've had in the past.Service was awesome, very friendly and accommodating staff!",

So yes, the batter didn't impress me that much. I mean, imagine some Cajun powder mixed with batter? Brings a whole different taste to your dish, doesn't it?The batter is quite bland, but not greasy at all. So that was definitely good. The fish on the other hand was absolutely brilliant. Really well cooked (or rather perfect amount of cooking). Had a very nice fishy taste to it.. The chips we a little greasy and too much in portion. I couldn't finish mine. Again, if their tables had a bottle of Tobasco sauce, maybe I would have gulped both of them down ;-).Ambiance wise, it's really fun atmosphere. There was a speaker right above me, so the music obviously felt a little loud.. but still, a fun place!",

We weren't sure how long the wait for a table might be, yet we took a chance that it would be worth it.Hubby ordered cod; I got haddock. The fish is DELICIOUS! It was crisp, flaky, and full of fresh-fish flavor. There are two negatives, though. \u00a0First, the chips could have been more crisp. Maybe growing up on North America has spoiled me to fried potatoes being absolutely crispy. The chips were quite tasty, despite the non-crispness. The one thing I hope never to encounter again is mushy peas. I've never encountered a dish of peas that didn't taste like peas. I suppose that not growing up in the British Isles, I'm not accustomed to the taste of these things, I shall refrain from calling them food. This green substance didn't taste at all like peas, but some sort of horrible bean dish. I added vinegar to what I'd had on my plate, and it made them somewhat palatable. We were both very glad to have plenty of fish left to take away the horrific taste of it.Again, the negatives are coming from someone who's grown up in the land of crispy fries and peas tasting like peas. I firmly believe that this place is worth the wait, and we'll probably be back before heading home to the states.",

Turns out this seems like a common enough thing to do.The good:Food was overall delicious. Probably the best fish I've had in a long time, short of a family fish fry. Chips were pretty standard. Had a nice presentation and the homemade tartar sauce was delicious. The not so good:Service. I'm not sure if it's just us being American, but it took about 20 minutes to clear our plates from the table post meal. Keep in mind that this is a tiny restaurant and that other people were coming and going around us. After our plates were taken, we waited another 20 minutes for the check. My husband actually went to ask for it and was told to \"relax and we'll bring it to you.\" Wellllllll, I think we'd been relaxing long enough already. With all time, it took us 2 hours to get in and out, which totally drained time on our first day in the city. I get that service isn't the same everywhere, but this was pretty outlandish.In summary, great fish and chips. Get takeaway and save yourself a pound or two and five hours of your time.",

Poppies had been voted one of the best places for fish and chips so I wanted to see if it lived up to all the hype.The theme of the restaurant is very 1950s from the waiters outfits to the jukebox and music, which I absolutely adore so I was already thrilled. I ordered the classic fish and chips and my uncle ordered the calamari and chips. We did what i like to call a \"swap\", which is when we share half our meal with the other person that way we can taste two meals at the same time. Both meals were huge I got the \"regular\" size portion but couldn't believe that they actually offer a bigger size than that because it was a really big piece of cod. Everything was absolutely delicious and \u00a0we were stuffed by the end of the meal. I also ordered a cream soda to drink, which made me happy because so few restaurants actually offer cream soda in the states and its one of my favorites. Our servers were very friendly and welcoming as well. I would love to come back if I'm ever in London again.",

So I don't know if maybe I over hyped myself up for this place or my standards for fish and chips got higher but this place didn't blow my socks off... First off, like the great planner I am, I made reservations for dinner here for a weeknight. Unfortunately for us, there was \u00a0a delay on the tube and we missed out reservation time by 10 minutes. Upon arrival I explained our situation and the hostess explained that they had given our table away and that we would have to wait in the que and that they would \"see what they could do\". Luckily the 3 groups in front of us opted for carry away instead and cut down our wait to about 15 minutes. Guess we lucked out... This place is small and felt like a maze just trying to get seated. We got seated near the window and ended up having to share our table with a group of French teenies who got seated right after us; no biggie. However word to the wise, if you enjoy your private space or are looking for ambiance, this place isn't for you. If you are looking for fun decor or 50's nostalgia then this place is it. Having found a fancy for haddock (as mentioned in my other fish and chip reviews) I opted for the large portion with chips. and my buddy ordered the a standard cod and chips. Our order came out quite quickly; about 15 minutes or so nice and hot fresh out of the fryer. On first break I noticed that the filet still had the skin on it. For me that's an instant buzkill for the meal because you end up destroying the fish and lose the texture of the crisp skin. Maybe its just me but I prefer the fish without the skin! Holla if you hear me! The other complaint I had was the portion size. I ordered a large haddock and my buddies regular cod was the same size. SMH why did I pay more for less?!? The cod was light and flaky but had a very fishy taste to it. The haddock was noticeably lighter and less flaky than the cod and in my option was the better of the 2. The chips were decent and proper however nothing mind blowing either. Not the worst Fish & Chips but I've had better. I wouldn't recommend if you are a tourist to go out of your way to eat here but it is a decent dining option if you are in the area. If you do plan on eating here be sure to make a reservation via Yelp or Open Table; trust me you'll thanks me later...",

That being said, it was pretty awesome.The Vibe:A little kitschy with the waitress outfits and getups in the kitchen, but nice options of seating indoors, or takeaway and standing out front. Service was friendly, despite the ever present communication gaps I had in London with our English cousins. \u00a0Great people watching outside.The Fish&Chip:One order of the rock, one haddock, and a large order of the fries is MORE than enough for two people. I had mixed feeling about the rock, it was a stronger flavor (fishy some would call it), but the fry on it and the texture was spot on. The haddock was perfectly fried, flaky, and delicious. Also gigantic. A large order of the fries filled the bottom of the two takeaway boxes, giving me the impression they have a heavy hand with the fries no matter the order size. The fries aren't fried hard, they're still pretty light in color but have a really nice flake on the inside. Downside to that is you have to eat them while they're very hot to hot, or they lose the texture. Everything needed a helping of salt, which I assume was standard since it and vinegar are table side, and tartar was extra which was annoying.",

Poppies gets a bonus point for taking the time to fully fillet the fish as I hate it when there is skin left on and I possibly have to go back to make sure my score is accurate but we'll see.I went for the haddock & chips which definitely was a better choice than the cod and although not cheap the taste was actually pretty good. The fish was flaky, the batter was not too greasy and the chips while not the best I've had in London were a lot better than being disappointing.My biggest issue with the whole meal was the way I felt afterwards. I found that the fish and chips sat incredibly heavy in my stomach and kept repeating which was not good. I didn't feel well for the rest of the day and as I'd only eaten breakfast before this the only culprit I can see is the haddock. I'll give it another go just in case but for now my view of Poppies is slightly tarnished",

So when a restaurant in London's East End has fish and chips in their name, you would hope that they know what they're doing.And Poppie's does. On an overcast Sunday (does the sun never shine in this country?), Poppie's was chock full of people with every table full and a short queue (\"line\" in American) of people waiting to be seated. So instead of waiting, I opted for a takeaway. A nice sized portion for well less than \u00a310, served in the traditional newspaper, it was a great portion of light and fluffy cod and a good number of what looked like hand cut chips. I managed to pour a few shakes of vinegar in there as well to get the full treat.Okay, so the newspaper thing. It turns out that the \"authorities\" no longer allow real newspaper to be used for wrapping food. Something to do with the ink leaking onto the food. So instead, restaurants have been using a fake newspaper that's printed with ink on it that doesn't bleed onto the food. Traditional, but modernized for your safety!The only downside is that there aren't many places nearby where you can grab a seat, so I ended up leaning against the wall and under an overhang to stay out of the rain.",

We opted for Poppies to get the fish.The setup is like a kitschy diner. It reminded me of Johnny Rocket's, and when we walked inside I was a little worried that we'd fallen into a tourist trap. It very well may be, for all I know, but I remembered that Katz's Deli in New York gets a ton of tourists and it's still really really good.We were seated quickly at a tiny tight table in the back. The waitress hurriedly took our order and was back in minutes with the food. Maybe it's cooked ahead of time to save time, but it must go fast because it was still fresh and crispy. We got haddock and cod so we could sample both. The regular size was MORE than enough. Tartar sauce was good as were the chips.The decor is cute, but again, kitschy. Very loud (but good) oldies music. The waitresses were nice but clearly wanted to turn tables over fast (which is good, I guess, because the place was packed and people kept coming in).Tasty food, polite and nice staff, decent prices, but not a relaxed atmosphere.

I sampled some of the haddock from a cousin's plate, and I think I actually enjoyed the haddock a bit more. The haddock was less meaty but I personally thought it had better flavor. Both are still good in my opinion! Also, if you're not into fish, Poppie's also has roast chicken and sausages. Definitely worth trying if you're looking for classic fish and chips.",

    "text": "Delicious fish and chips with the best staff. Got the haddock and the cod fish and chips and they were both good! Haddock has more fish flavour so it was our favourite. Crisp is thinner than what I'm used to so there's more fish in every bite. A very touristy place to eat yet the staff were so friendly. There was a 10 min wait to get seated and the host assured me ever so often I'd be seated soon. Everyone was so friendly and always smiling. Never tried ginger beer before so thought we'd give it a try and ended up liking it so much we ordered another. Overall very pleasant experience with great service. Highly recommend.",

I've had way better fish and chips at diners and bars in America. Ketchup lovers beware: they are stingy with Ketchup; it's served in little bottles good enough for maybe 3 or 4 chips. I had to ask my waiter 4+ times for more since it served in such a small portion. Still, the meal was not bad, the portions were good, the atmosphere is fun. I would recommend it just for the experience.",

    "text": "Very nice piece of fried fish. Yelp and many other lists recommend Poppies as one of the best Fish and Chips places in London. It did not disappoint. The restaurant has diner atmosphere and casual, friendly service. I went for the 'regular' size traditional cod with a side of mushy peas and a lager. If that was the regular then the large must be meant to be shared. The fish itself was perfectly fried. Very flavorful, juicy, with a light, crisp batter and not oily. Definitely one of the best pieces of fried fish I have tried. The chips were just ok. They tasted like homemade fries. Probably just fried once since they were not super crispy on the outside. I found the fish tasted better with malt vinegar or tartar sauce than with lemon, so don't squeeze it all over till you try it separately first. The mushy peas... well... they tasted exactly like what you expect. I like peas, but these must be British kids nightmare food. I don't know what the point of mushing them is. They were just bland, mushed peas. I rescued them a bit by adding a good amount of salt and pepper (which definitely helped). Maybe you're supposed to add S&P, I dunno. By the way, judge me if you want, but I like the option to order half pints. Sometimes you want beer with your food, but don't want to be too full so early. Great for a casual, quick, and filling lunch.",

    "text": "Landing in London, the two things that I wanted to eat the most was: Fish and Chips and a full English breakfast. However, I was pretty disappointed after eating at this establishment. Despite the high ratings of this place, the food here did not leave me wanting more; it also did not amaze me in any way, shape, or form. We came here around 8:00 PM on a Friday night and it was not particularly crowded or anything. We were seated right away and immediately knew what we wanted to eat--my brother and I both ordered the Fish and Chips (Haddock or Cod--I do not know as we did not specify) and two cream sodas. Just an FYI, they have a bunch of other things as well like Steak Pies! The food came out pretty fast and I was initially excited when I saw the dish; however, upon eating the fish it did not stand out to any of the other Fish & Chips that I have had in the United States. The fries were unsalted (thank god so I can choose how much to put) were soggy and probably one of the most fries I have ever eaten. It literally tasted like the thick cut fries that my parents get at the grocery store.The fish tasted really fresh and while I have never had Fish & Chips with the skin still on, it was not bad. The biggest issue for me despite using the vinegar and salt was the lack of or lack thereof the tater sauce and ketchup. They literally only give you a table spoon of ketchup and tater sauce and the fish was super hard to eat without the aforementioned. It just felt super greasy and starchy (from the potatoes). I definitely felt full at the end of the meal, but I also felt super bloated from the grease. Like I said, more tater sauce and ketchup would have helped. All and all, it was a disappointing first meal in London. I would not recommend going here but the locals say this place is bomb so I suggest you trying it for yourself. Service was typical; a 12.5% service fee is added automatically like at most other U.K. spots so you don't really need to tip again unless you feel the need to. I feel like you can get fish and chips anywhere out here so I would suggest looking around.",

    "text": "THE original Poppies! After all of the times we had tried fish and chips in pubs, my girlfriend and I gave Poppies a visit during our vacation. We heard it was the real deal and supposedly some of the best fish and chips in all of London so the expectations were already sky high before we arrived.We came here on a Saturday evening at about 8:30pm and, as expected, it was a PACKED house! We had to wait in line, but luckily we only waited about 10 minutes before we got a table in the crammed back area. The restaurant was already small as it was, with tables literally on top of each other, but the back was even more crammed if you could believe it. Throughout the evening we felt the service was blah. We weren't paid much attention to and, unfortunately, the waitresses weren't the nicest folks.There wasn't much of a greeting, you're welcome or have a good evening when we left. The one good thing about the service was that our food came to our table fast, however it was probably because the fish was pre-fried and sitting, waiting to be served already. How did we assume that? Because we saw that they chefs were storing fried fishes in a small containment area that kept them warm at the counter.We both ended up ordering the Regular Haddock Fish & Chips because, frankly, the Large seemed inhumane to try to finish as we witnessed a Large served to another courageous customer. To be honest, I don't think they won that battle. With all of the hype that Poppies had going for it, we expected a lot better. The Haddock was just average to us. It didn't have much flavor to it and was a bit bland tasting. It was fried really well though and kept it's form despite our dousing of it with vinegar. The Haddock also came with a SHIP LOAD of chips, which was the most we received from any pub or restaurant serving fish and chips. Also, there was the ketchup and tartar sauce were served in small little jars, which was a nice touch presentation-wise.Also, a few tidbits about the restaurant. Since it was small, confined and the kitchen shared its space with the dining area it was EXTREMELY hot inside the restaurant. There wasn't much ventilation inside, which made for an uncomfortable experience. In addition, prior to sitting, we noticed that there was actually a significant price difference between eating in and take-out, which we found odd. We could only attribute the price difference to service fees/tips, but that we didn't know for sure. With all of the good to pretty good reviews, we definitely expected a lot more out of the fish and chips, but it just rather pedestrian.",

All the servers were nice and wearing overalls so you feel like you stepped into a time machine but not in a bad way. The waitresses and staff were all really nice and warm. As for the food, I got the regular fish (haddock) and chips and although i liked it, in my mind I thought it would be more seasoned. Maybe if the batter had more seasoning and flavor i could have bumped it up to a 5 star review. Overall I felt it was a no frills traditional fried fish and chips but I will say I was expecting more since I always thought it was a British staple. Good portion sizes though!",

After a very short wait due to the late time, I got a seat against the wall with a nice view of everything.Looking through the menu I got the small plate of Cod with Chips and side of peas and a local Beer. \u00a0The Fish was wonderful. Not to greasy, super crisp and it had perfect flavor from being so fresh. I could eat a bowl of their Tartar Sauce. It was lovely.I will be honest and tell you that the chips were a disappointment. They were limp and slightly soggy and not so hot. They tasted ok but nothing like a good chip in Belgium or the Netherlands.They needed to be crisp and hot. I asked for them to fry them a second time on my next visit but they were just as disappointing.The peas were nice and I ate them all, since I needed the veg but it was a big bowl made to share.I thought I was done for the night until I saw Sticky Toffee Pudding on the menu board. It was fantastic. Bring a date just for this treat.I left so happily full I decided I'd be back. Which I did one more time. For the Fish and the pudding.This would be a 5 star place if not for the Chips.",

Before I got a chance to try Poppies, I had gotten fish & chips at other places in the UK/Europe and was pretty satisfied with what I got. With this in mind, when I finally got to try poppies, I was pretty disappointed. I really didn't feel there was anything special to it. I had better Fish & chips in Europe and I really don't feel like I'd go back to a Poppies. I got the cod and a haddock and if I had to make a choice, I would go with the cod.",

We also ordered some curry sauce. Being a northerner by blood I do like my curry sauce, but my goodness this was awful. Chip shop curry sauce is meant to be tacky but the only places who seem to get it right are Chinese fish and chip shops. Still everything else we had was lovely. Service friendly and I did like that people were dressed in a retro way. For this area it's nice to have a proper chippy that gives you massive portions and a good healthy dose of nostalgia in every bite. But in a southern way. They can't get the curry sauce right.",

The atmosphere is amazing if you are a 50s lover like me: awesome music (last time, aretha Franklin), 50s memorabilia on the walls and waitress dressed like the cafe in back to the future 2!But more important (well, that's not true, let's say as important as) than the place, the food. First time you come here, you already know what to have: fish n chips, regular. The cod is perfectly cooked, moist and compact, nicely fried (crispy and not greasy). Wonderful! Chips are good, they are bigger than usual size (as I prefer) and perfectly fried. I'm actually wondering about how they manage to have such a perfect fried food, it's amazing!Ah btw, portions are generous! It's not that cheap, but I can tell you, one dish is more than enough and you won't regret the expense! Only one defect: beers are not that good and they are a bit expensive, but you are going there for food not to drink, right!?!In conclusion, definitely suggested, it's totally worth the money and the waiting time (yes, be prepared to wait a bit as it seems to be crowded every day at every tine!), just enjoy your 50s hideout! !",

    "text": "I think Poppies is a place that proves to Northerners that people in London know nothing about fish and chips.Having lived in quite a few places over the last ten years I can tell you that this place is nothing special. It serves up a decent fish and chips. Not great by any stretch. You have to take into consideration where this place is, round Brick Lane/ Shorteditch. Anything vaguely retro or ironic and everybody's thundering on about how amazing it is. My response is, you can't eat the decor.So to the food! The extortionate, over-hyped but woefully underwhelming food. If you want a fish and chips you'll be looking at around \u00a310-\u00a315. I've lived in Newcastle where the fish is freshly landed just hours ago, they're making everything there and then in the kitchen and it has come to about a third of the price of this and tasted so much better. (Probably because they weren't throwing your money at twee faux-vintage junk for the walls)The fish was tough on the inside and the batter was oily, probably due to being in the fryer too long at too low a temperature. The chips were undercooked- it seemed like the whole order had been rushed through to get people in and out as fast as possible. Joking about how if this was a chippy, where was the gravy, the manager/ owner gruffly told me that this was a traditional sort of restaurant and that he made the best chips in London. Firstly, there was curry sauce on the menu but no gravy, not sure how that's traditional but whatever. Secondly he was a grumpy sod as soon as people had anything but compliments or cash for him and lastly, NO. These were not the best chips in London. If, as he claims, he's spent his life doing this I can only imagine that a lifetime of grease fumes have gummed up his neural pathways. They weren't even the best chips on that street. I'd normally give this three stars for just being an average nothing-to-write-home-about fish and chip restaurant but the fact it rates itself so highly just because there's nothing similar in the area and therefore no competition brings it down. It's complacent, lackluster and hoping that the pictures on the walls distract you from this. There's nowhere else that does fish and chips nearby so it'll do in a fix and if you're feeling flush. I'd be embarrassed to take any of my non-London friends or family here.",

The batter, the freshness of the fish, and the sogginess of some of the chips and the crunchiness of others... everything was spectacular and has completely ruined it for me forever.

Thankfully, it's open late. With all the people crammed in the restaurant, it does get very loud. I was having a hard time listening to my friends at our table. Service was speedy, however. The cook on the fish and chips was excellent, though I can't say I was blown away by the flavors or quality. I appreciated the single-serving ketchup and tartar sauce, but I think I would have preferred a regular-sized bottle of the ketchup for the chips.Overall, this place was decent, and I don't regret going.

The fish was fried nicely and I enjoyed it more than the chips. I'm personally a fan of thin fries so that's probably why. Soon after, a group of tourists came in for lunch too. This is definitely a popular tourist attraction. Overall, I didn't think Poppies was mind-blowing, but it's definitely a decent spot if you're craving some fish and chips.",

My only gripe is that the fish is breaded and cooked with the skin on which I would have preferred the skin removed. Instead I just ate the top and left the skin on the plate. *I'm not sure if the restaurant gives you the option to have the skin removed.*We both ordered a side of mushy peas which was quite large.

For the authentic fish and chip taste, it's where everyone recommends so I had to try it out. It was quite busy on a weekday evening. You had to wait for a table. Takeout is available.There's a variety of fish and chips meals. I tried the cod and chips for \u00a312.20 ... and added calamari rings starter. Everything tasted fresh. But it was a bit too fried/oily for me.I'd still recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "Fish & Chips and cool vibes, This was recommended by several locals to stop in for fish and chips which we did. I ordered the large and well my eyes were bigger than my stomach. The large is a healthy portion so I would advise to get only if you are really hungry. The cod was great and had good flavor. The chips were a bit soft for my liking but all in all good flavor. Service was great. We were the first ones seated in the back room and the space filled up within ten minutes of being there. One annoyance was that my dad was sitting at the head of the table which was near the entry and kept having to pull his chair in each time a guest passed. It would have been nice to put at a large table were we weren't in the way. It took away from the food experience. The decor is cool and it was fun to read all the different posters and pictures on the walls.",

Trusty Yelp pointed us to Poppies - and they take reservations, so score for them. When we arrived, the incredibly lovely servers immediately took us to our table by the windows, and the experience was really fantastic.The service was fast and friendly, and the food was delish. They had a local cider too! We had fish and chips and a chicken pie with chips. I'm not a fish and chips connoisseur, but it was light, crispy, and not greasy. Oh, and the sticky toffee pudding we split was gone in about 30 seconds - it was that good.So, if you're near Shoreditch and looking for some good traditional food, head on over to Poppies!",

(American's think Johnny Rockets, Mel's Diner type of place). Bottomline they offer a nice offering of fish.I am a big fan of fish and chips. I tried to get it as often as possibly while roaming the streets of London. Poppies is a fairly cheap place to grub (10 pounds for an order)The fish comes in a big fresh fillet of fish really crispy with a good portion of chips. The fish is moist with a good crunch with the batter, and not over fried or dry. I like how they offer different cuts of fish so a good variety of textures can be indulged to satisfy that guilty pleasure. \u00a0TIPS: After the meal, they give you some licorice candy from the \"owners\" homeland. It is awful. Don't try it. The waitress (a nice British gal) didn't even know what the candy was and she works there..",

But I seem to only come here when I've already just eaten, or I'm on my way to somewhere else for a meal. However, neither scenario prevents me from walking away with a giant newspaper cone full of steamy starchy chips!Grab some condiments from the salt and malt vinegar shakers chained to the counters just outside and for a mere \u00a32.30, you have enough fried potato to satisfy a party of three or four people with a savoury snack.Between the exceptionally quick service and the reliably good takeaway treat, I always have a problem with passing up Poppies whenever I'm down on Hanbury. I -do- have to stop in one of these days to finally try their fried fish, too... with chips, of course!",

During my visit to England, I wanted to give my girl-friend a true tasty of British food, and nothing more British than fish and chips. Being from eastern part of India, we love fish (cooked in any form, be sushi, be it curry). I have been to couple of London fish & chips institutions before (Bailey's, Golden Hind) during my previous visits, but this was my first visit to Poppies. Decor is nothing extraordinary, but after we were seated, you do feel that the place is pretty cramped. Now coming to the most important part of the experience, the food. I ordered regular Cod and my girl friend ordered large Haddock. I also ordered side of mushy peas. It was delicious. Fish was moist and full of flavor, the batter was crispy but not heavy. Mushy was good too. Nothing special to add about the chips, regular chips, nothing out of ordinary. Can not say whether this is the best Fish & Chips in London or not, but surly one of the best. Most importantly my girl-friend enjoyed the food, which made the trip even more enjoyable ;)",

    "text": "What could be more British than fish & chips? Despite the fact that it's battered and deep fried and served up with a side of chips that puts the term \"Super-size\" to shame, you can't help but crave it. And when such a craving strikes, there are few better places than Poppies to go to. Located near Liverpool St, this is going to be my go-to place to line the stomach before a night out. While there is seating, it tends to be quite busy and for fish and chips I don't need more than a place to rest my tray - luckily the outside tables are perfect for this! I opted for the cod on the recommendation of the girl taking my order and I can't say I was disappointed. The massive piece of fish was juicy and flaky and cooked to perfection. The batter managed to stay crispy and dry without giving in to the oiliness that KFC chicken and most chippies' products have in spades. The chips were thick and fluffy with just a hint of crispiness on the outside. While they were tasty and filling, I would have preferred more crunch. I will say that these beasts of potato can absorb a fantastic amount of malt vinegar which just supports my stomach-lining preference.Overall, for less than a tenner you get a delicious filling meal that will keep you going without clogging your arteries. It's hard to ask for much better than that!",

    "text": "Opening Remarks:-Opened in 1945-Owned by Pop Newland, a British man who's been making fish & chips his entire life.-With the success of their original location in East London, the family opened up a second shop in Camden Town.-They are frequently regarded as the top Fish & Chip parlor in London.-Poppies offers live music Fridays and Saturdays.Ambiance:-Straight out of a scene from a post-war film. The posters on the wall speak to war-time paraphernalia and 50s pinup housewife jokes (so my style). The ceiling is lined with old toys and housewares from the 50s including the tiniest television I have ever seen (then again, nowadays we watch TV on our phones!)-Beside the dining room there is a line up out the door for quick take out. Patrons can take it home or stand around one of the high top tables outside.Service:-Fast, efficient and remarkably friendly - our server asked us how we would like our meal timed (thank you!!!) and if we would like new cutlery and plates between courses.-Servers all dress up in 1950s nautical type dresses - honestly, it's like Poppy's was personally created for me!Drink Menu:-I believe the other location offers booze, but we were already feeling loopy from jet lag so ordered simple with a few Cokes in retro bottles to keep things sober.Menu:-Heavily fish & chip based rounded out with a variety of classic British staples like baked beans and mushy peas.-All fish is sustainably caught and purchased from Peterhead Fisheries.-There are 13 different seafood options for your fish & chip supper.-Take-Away meals are served in newspaper like the good old days.Hand Peeled Prawn Cocktail ( 4.95)We certainly weren't expecting baby shrimp in a Russian-type mayo dressing laying on a mound of iceberg, but it was pretty tasty. My only complaint is that I wished there was some dressing on the lettuce below and a little less on top as it was hard to get an evenly dressed bite.Gherkin ( 1.00)Yum. Mild sweetness and not too sour, a great pickle.Garden Peas ( 2.45)These are you-know-who's favourite food so he was super pleased with this. Simple but effective.Halibut and Chips ( 15.90)I can see what the fuss is about-these were damn good F&Cs. The halibut was so moist, it literally melted like butter on the tongue, while the batter was crispy but light. The chips, while not my personal style of fried potatoes (I like skinnier with skin and more browning), were undeniably fluffy.Cartmel Sticky Toffee Pudding ( 4.60)Months ago (maybe years ago) Carmel tweeted to me all the way from England and I have since wanted to try their famous STP. Well, it was damn good. Not too sweet, but super moist and delicate, I loved the rich molasses flavour of the cake. I wasn't particularly hungry but I ate it all up.Closing Remarks:-Bill for 5 dishes and 2 pops came to 37 including tax and tip ($60 Canadian). Kind of pricey considering what we got and what we would likely pay for this in a fish and chip shop at home-Despite the price, the food and service was great and I loved the nostalgia atmosphere and for that alone I would be back.",

You also get a variety of different fish that you can have fried. I had the skate fish which was delicious and you can eat the bones with it. My bro had the cod which was yummy. French fries were just so so. Prolly one of my favorite meals in London.",

I loved taking out of town friends to Poppies for this reason, and for its delicious food. The fish is also flakey, and I never have a problem with anything being too oily (which seems to be pretty common at other places). They also offer a range of \"classic\" soft drinks and sides. Although a little pricey, I think that when the whole atmosphere and quality of food are considered, it's worth it. My only complaint would be that sometimes it's quite hard to grab some of the waitstaff's attentions. But other than that it's a fun place to grab some classic fish and chips. Oh, and they have this funny thing where they rope off the dining area from the to-go line. My friends always joke that the host is like a bouncer, because he has to move the rope to let people in.",

    "text": "What an amazing place to have the classic English dish of Fish and Chips. The restaurant design is old school yet fresh and funky, the food is just what I needed. The traditional cod was cooked with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and tenderness on the inside. The chips played their role very well providing the needed balance of flavours. No visit to Poppies is ever complete without trying their famous homemade mushy peas, every spoonful was delightful. For dessert I went with another classic - sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. The hot pudding and cold ice cream complimented each other very well. All of this was washed down with a bottle of great Camden Brewery pale ale.I definitely recommend a visit to Poppies if you are in or near Spitalfields. It is nostalgic meal in the middle of a modern food district and just makes you feel as though you are having a classic English experience. Highly recommended for anyone.",

The Fish and Chips: The Fish in this thing was juicy and fluffy. I've had my share of fish all over, and this is by far the most fluffy plump fish I've had. You've gotta try it to understand what I'm trying to explain here. Get this. The Curry Sauce: \u00a0A nice addition to add some flavor to our fish and chips, but not necessary. The bread pudding: I dont know what toffee sauce they used on this but it was pure crack. Do not leave this place without giving this a try. On a side not their cappuccino was randomly amazing, and I'm not even a coffee guy. In the area or just visiting? Make sure you come by Poppies!",

While definitely, not bad, the meal wasn't great either. You are presented with three options for fish, and I went with the cod. It comes with one piece of fish and some chips (fries) on the side. Pretty standard haha. The fish was pretty good, lightly battered and the actual meat was cooked well and not overly well done. However, it was pretty bland and could use a bit extra sauce. As a result, this resulted in me having to ask for me second, third, and fourth serving of tartar sauce.The chips were pretty bland and soft. Maybe it was just too late in the night, but I was thoroughly disappointed with them.Service was great. The waiters / waitresses were attentive and explained the menu well.Overall, it was a very fun environment and while the food was disappointing given the hype, it was a decent meal in general.",

I honestly have no idea what made it so popular when you could probably pop into any other pub, market, or restaurant and find better fish and chips in London.We opted for the traditional fish and chips while some of us got the Cod and others with the Haddock. At \u00a311.70, it's a bit pricey for the meal. You get one piece of fish with this thick-cut chips. While the fish itself was standard, the chips were rather dry and tasteless. Just a note, haddock has a more fishy taste than cod if you're deciding which one to get. I definitely preferred the cod. On the upside, the plate did come with these cute little containers for the tartar sauce and ketchup. These condiments were definitely needed to make the meal though.While the food was mediocre, it was the service that really pushed me to the edge. We waited a good 20 minutes trying to pay for our bill while the table next to us arrived after us had already finished.",

IT WAS SO GOOD. Opted for the large cod and chips it was about \u00a315+ to go(takeaway). The place was pretty lively around noon on a Friday, I ordered at the counter and received the food almost immediately; kinda figured id received something that was laying around but as soon as my wife and I opened that box, saw a huge helping of meaty cod with nice golden crisp fries(chips). The ladies at the counter offer to season your order with salt and malt vinegar, Ketchup and tartar sauce are also available, if youd like to season your own right outside the shop are two stations where you can do it yourself. Highly delicious, highly recommended.",

The \"smaller\" order is definitely enough for one person and it was great...nice, quality fish that was perfectly fried and perfectly seasoned; the chips were also nice with good potato flavor and the right texture: soft on the inside and slightly crispy outside. We managed to find room for dessert and decided to go with another traditional British dish: sticky toffee pudding - this was also very good with nice sweetness and good creaminess from the ice cream topping.Definitely check out this awesome spot!",

It wasn't bad though, just not great. We ordered the traditional fish and chips in both types of fish (cod and haddock) in the large size. I prefer multiple smaller pieces of smaller fried fish rather than one big fish. It was also hard to dip into the ketchup and tartar sauces that were in such small containers. The portions were good though. The hot seafood platter was only okay, as the whitebait was very fishy. We also ordered the jellied eels just to try it, and weren't huge fans. The eel was fine but I didn't care for the jelly part. The homemade mushy peas are also apparently an England thing, and they taste exactly like the name sounds and I felt like I was eating baby food. Even if I don't care for these English dishes though, I'm still very glad we ordered them and it was great that we were able to try multiple traditional dishes in one meal.The atmosphere of Poppies is fun, and the waitresses were quick to get us what we needed.",

    "text": "Poppies fish & chips is one of those restaurants you should go to if you're in London. I mean, London is \"known\" for their fish and chips after all, but I somehow don't think locals really frequent this restaurant or eat much fish and chips. Anyway, I heard good things about this place before coming here and made a reservation for a Sunday night. Truth be told, you don't need a reservation as the turnover of those dining there is quite fast. They actually didn't even care when I said I had a reservation; they just led me to an available table. To no one's surprise, me and my friend ordered the cod fish and chips. to me, the fries were the best part of the meal and they weren't anything special. The fried cod was very dry and I expected more of a crunch. I would say it was even bland for my taste. The ketchup (yes, Americans you get a small ketchup!) And tartar sauce were served in these tiny jars which were cute. We ordered the poppies beer and it was a fine light beer option and why not try their special beer. Service was friendly and they helped me order a dessert (a chocolate cake/bread pudding of some sort??) in secrecy for my friends birthday and someone came out singing the happy birthday song to her embarrassment and my amusement. The dessert, however, was way too sweet.You can skip this place of it's out of the way, but it is one of londons most well known restaurants so you can give it a shot. London is known for their lackluster food, so I'm not completely shocked that this place is on the top of the London eats list.",

    "text": "Poppies kind of confuses me. I get that it's meant to be the most tourist-friendly place to consistently serve delicious fish and chips in London, but the retro 1950s decor goes right over my head. I know the owners claim that the decor harkens back to post-World War II East London, but it creates a discongruence for me because I feel like I'm dining in a kitschy American diner. It even looks like the BB gun air rifle from the movie A Christmas Story is on the wall. Really now? How quaint...But sometimes I just want classic British comfort food when I'm in London. I'm sure I'd probably get a more authentic experience if I went to a random takeaway place on the street, but the food here doesn't disappoint, especially with the generous portion sizes. The large is big enough to split with a friend, but I'd recommend getting one order of the cod fish and chips and one of the haddock so you can see which one is your favorite. (Hint: the difference in taste is extremely subtle.) The fish was fresh and perfectly fried without being not too greasy either. The chips were chips -- couldn't complain as they weren't soggy.Accept the fact that you're a tourist and check fish and chips off your London to-do list here after perusing the Spitalfields Market stalls. Try to come here for lunch because it gets crowded for dinner.",

Poppie's gave us a small sample and it was amazing. The batter was perfectly light and crispy and it actually stuck to the cod! Usually, every fish & chips I've had, the batter was too thick and it fell off the fish, which is a sign of a bad batter. The chips were yummy and well-cooked. I suggest getting the mushy peas to go with it! Slather that baby on there like there's no tomorrow. My only thing is with this location is that there's not enough room to sit but you can always take it on the go! This is the only place I've had fish & chips in London, unfortunately, but I definitely can tell you it's worth a visit. For \u00a312 per cod dish, it's pretty worth it when the cod is just as big as the plate.",

    "text": "This is the place to take someone for a solid fish and chips with charm but not the grit. Like the Disney World of Fish and Chips but in a quality way. The atmosphere feels slightly \"done\" but when it comes to showing someone around town, the cutesy factor mostly works: the men behind the counter battering and frying are appropriately disgruntled... in a charming way, the waiters and waitresses rush around with their brows slightly furrowed (wanting to be sure you're pleased)... in a charming way. The jellied eel really jiggles in an authentic, but... not so charming way. However, the bread and butter it came with was almost like a sweet brioche so it looked and felt \"authentic\" but tasted better than the soggy white bread you'd get at a typical hole in the wall spot. The crust on the fish and chips was tasty on its own, and not overly greasy, the tartar sauce was nice. The chips were hit or miss, some nice crispy ones, some chunky bland ones, but douse those things in some malt vinegar and you're golden. We tried both haddock and cod, the piece of haddock was thinner and smooth, fall-apart texture whereas the cod was a chunkier piece making the meat slightly drier and more flakey. Since the piece was rather hefty, some bites were just straight up cod, which isn't really meant to speak for itself in this type of meal. I guess this is up to preferences, but with the haddock, the crust to protein ratio just felt so right!You can make reservations via the website, and since there's always at least a bit of a line about 10 or more people deep. Unless you're really going after that amusement park experience, why wait in a queue?",

I came with the recommendations of a friend who used to live in London, and I wasn't disappointed with the food. The service, on the other hand, was very poor.The restaurant has a 50's vibe to it and they added these funny 50's housewives memes on the wall. Made me laugh as I was facing it.

We know what we wanted since poppies is know for their fish and chips so I went for the haddock and my husband got the cod. We ordered a side of mushy peas since that's what you are suppose to eat with fish and chips? Anyways, our food came out pretty quick and these are pretty big portions. You get a sizable piece of fish for the regular size. I'm not sure what you would get for the larger size! So out of the cod and haddock, I preferred the haddock as it seemed juicier to me then the cod. For the mushy peas, I didn't particularly like this at first but after awhile it grew on me. You are not missing out if you opt out of mushy peas lol. The 'chips' were fresh and crisp as well. This is a great lunch option and super filling as well! You can dine in or order to go so it's super convienent!",

I'd have to politely disagree.Prices:Kind of expensive, definitely not fast food prices, but reminiscent to the Americans' Ruby's. Kind of what you'd expect out of the place.Service: Prompt & polite. No complaints! Very friendly.Food:I've had better Fish & Chips. While the cod I ordered wasn't dry, it wasn't very moist either. A little on the oily side & not too full of flavor. I didn't dislike this fish, but I wasn't crazy about it. I just think it could've been better. Perhaps I should've chosen the Plaice or Halibut. The seafood sampler was okay too. I did however, enjoy the mushy peas with a little pinch of salt (why England, why? Why so bland?). The tea I got was really good though. Can't complain about tea!Environment:50s diner that has a lower level bathroom area. Rather medium interior, but it's also very cramped. Did deal with very obnoxious patrons, which isn't the restaurant's fault at all...but when a woman originally from the UK asks you to identify mushy peas & claims she's from Jersey.........where do these people .... I don't even...GO HOME. Oh wait, she's supposedly already home...omg whatever, GO BACK TO JERSEY. YOU'RE BAD & YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD. Would not say this place is the best. Would not recommend it, but if you're in the area, it doesn't hurt to try it.",

I like them crispy on the outside light and fluffy on the inside.Mashy peas are the bomb....just the best.The decor is very american Kitschy....america has many themes like this. Chillis, Mels, TGIF etc....but the similarities end there.Good place for fish and chips!",

We shared a large cod fish and chips and a calamari appetizer. Because of the calamari, which was freshly made, our food which came altogether, took a while.The fish and chips were the star of the night. They managed to make a deep fried dish not overly greasy, with the chips made from fresh potatoes. I suspect their chips may not be twice fried, hence not achieving the crispness, but I didn't mind it as I do love my chips slightly mushy. Our cod flaked nicely and wasn't over done. Batter was light and not overly chunky, *almost* like an English version of tempura! Everything went well with lemon and tartar sauce. Yum!Our calamari was over-priced, with 5 thick rings for \u00a35. Probably would not order it again because of the waiting time.Would I come back again? Yes, for a quick dinner and a fish and chips fix!",

The fish and chips were bland. There was no difference between the haddock and cod. The taste of both fish were tasteless. First of all, the service was meh, and it took forever for them to bring our food. The food was a lot, but it was too pricey for fish and chip. You are better off getting fish and chip from your local chips shop. Those local places taste better than this place. I really think they are using their name and brand to sell tasteless food. Also, they sat us really close to other patrons, which I didn't like. I understand the establishment is small, but do I have to hear the conversations of other people while I eat. I couldn't even focus on my own thoughts, and I wasn't able to talk to my brother, the person I came with. My brother was disappointed in this place, and this was his first time having fish and chips in London. Not worth it. Go to your local fish and chip shop.",

You could definitely tell this was geared towards pleasing tourists and my parents weren't complaining!The service was attentive and enthusiastic, even posing in a photo with my family. We ordered a large portion of both the cod and haddock. One large was definitely enough to feed the three of us. The fish and chips could definitely use a bit more seasoning but I find that to be the case for most fish and chips in London. Nevertheless, it was nothing a little mayo, ketchup, or even some whole grain mustard couldn't fix. Definitely stop by Poppies and head right across to the Old Spitalfields Market for a bit of shopping!",

    "text": "Poppies, Spitalfields - 13 years living in the UK and now when you say Friday, I think fish and chips. But it need not be a Friday for fish and chips; certainly so, for Poppies. This place is filled almost every day of the week. Families, friends and even, tourists. And this is because of the glamour of Poppies merit.The interior is very simple but there it lots to look at; the wall space is not wasted. Populated with photos, miniature soldiers statues and cockney rhymes were engaging. Poppies exudes a strong takeaway setting with seating. The jukebox, the polka-dot uniformed waitress with their head ribbons have the air of an American diner. But Poppies is truly British. It dates back to 1945, just after the second world war.Fish at Poppies is all sustainably sourced. The choices include cod, haddock, halibut, skate, rock, mackerel, lemon sole and plaice (from \u00a311.90). Favourite scampi and calamari (from \u00a38.90) is also on the menu. Because Poppies is more than just a fish bar there is a choice of roasted chicken (whole chicken at \u00a317.90, half at \u00a310.90 and quarter at \u00a37.90), sausages and pies (from \u00a37.90). Children meals are offered at just under \u00a35.00.To satiate the sweet tooth, some very classic British puddings such as caramel sticky toffee pudding, apple pie and ice-cream (junst under \u00a35.00) look very tempting but we decided to watch the waistline for now.small cod fish and chips \u00a311.70 - small is a good description, especially when taking the price into account. Good quality fish with a rather average batter, only a bit better than yer average chippy really. Chips were fairly good but again, unremarkable.hot seafood platter \u00a314.95 - with whitebait, squid rings, cod fillets and scampi - a largish platter for one but a good share for mum and I. I thought it would be a good summary of what Poppies do. It was almost everything on the plate. Very nice cod fillets, squid rings were a little rubbery, scampi was good but we were not crazy about the fried whitebait.Poppies is not cheap. Our bill came to just under \u00a325 - \u00a330 for two people. And that did not include drinks. I would be happy to dine here again. Especially so because I missed their famous jellied eels. Anyone had that? Check their website, here, if you need delivery service.",

    "text": "I've read some reviews... From Americans and Brits both...and im a dual citizen so here is my take ! My experience w/ chippies growing up:Always ate at my local high street spot with an overload of greasy chips and a huge slab of greasy cod with the batter falling off. Cod in my past was probably never really super fresh. Not only have I been overeating but I can tell the color was always off and eating out of heavily inked newspaper probably wasn't a good idea. But simply put- I never questioned it because it's British tradition. At the end of the day always felt bloated with a bit of indigestion to top it off. ( but it's always yummy going down with plenty of malt vinegar )Anyway queue Poppies:Fun atmosphere. Very friendly , smiling, attentive staff. Impressed with customer service. Cod fish was perfectly fried with golden brown batter, inside the cod was pure white and meaty- best quality I have ever seen. Chips were portioned well- a little too fresh from the fryer and hot for me (I like my chips soft and mushy ). There were no remnants of oil anywhere on my plate ! Sticky toffee pudding with ice cream best I've ever had. Chicken pie tasty, soft, perfect ratio of filling to pastry. Pies in my past usually have hard tough pastry with dried out filling. They really have their portions, cook time, products, freshness all down to a tee! I'll be back before I leave back to LA!",

Apparently this restaurant has been open through three generations and the food is still cooked by the family. Makes it legit!Everything is delicious. We got a cod, a halibut, and a skate. Wanted to try haddock but they had run out. My favorite was cod. You have to pay extra for fries. And also for ketchup. What is that? Fries I understand. But making me pay for ketchup? That's London I guess.",

    "text": "Yummy. Hot and fresh fish & chips. Poppies is a wonderful spot out on the East side of London where you can get a good fried fish and chips. I choose the haddock. You are able to choose different sizes and what type of fish you want. We also got a side of mushy peas to round out our classic Fish & Chips joint and cross it off our London Must Eats. Tips: Pour a light amount of malt vinegar on the chips and fish as you eat them. Dont make the mistake to put over all of it at the beginning because by the end it will get soggy. Fun Fact: Due to the laws in London, you can no longer put fish & chips on newspaper. But famous Poppie refused and decided he would print his own newspaper with edible ink so that he could continue to wrap it in newspaper.",

I did also see the huge amounts of great fresh fish that was brought in.So I had to:1 Take the same picture2 try the foodYou can eat in and take away. There is usually a queue, especially during the weekend and when the weather permits there are loads of people just sitting or standing on the pavement eating there Fish & Chips.You can choose size and type of fish. I had the large haddock a few times and I loved it. Although battered fried is not my usual preferred fish dish, I did enjoy the tasty fish, clearly very fresh and well prepared, and well fried so not too fatty.The chips are also good but I could not really eat a lot of the chips with the fish because it was just too much.",
