    "text": "Even after five years of living in London I am always amazed at the overwhelming attitude of wait staff that they are somehow doing you, the customer, a favour. \u00a0Last I checked it's called the SERVICE industry and the customer is your job.I made a brunch reservation here for my birthday based on a friend's colleague's recommendation. \u00a0There were 7 people and we had to ask repeatedly and waited about 20 minutes for a menu. \u00a0I should also add the brunch menu is small and mostly egg or meat dishes. \u00a0The waiter acted like he was completely inconvenienced when we flagged him down to order. \u00a0One of my friends simply wanted toast with scrambled eggs without the smoked salmon on offer. \u00a0You would have thought we asked for his first born. \u00a0I finally said to him \"Can't you just leave the smoked salmon off the plate? \u00a0We will pay the same price!\" \u00a0His response, \"ugh, ok fine.\" and walked away. The icing on the cake was when some other woman came to collect the payment and we didn't leave a tip. \u00a0\"Why are you not leaving a tip?\" she asked. \u00a0We told her the food was ok, but service was not and the waiter could have been more helpful and friendly when taking our order. \u00a0Rather than apologise or find out more she simply said \"Right\", took our money and walked away. Not impressed. \u00a0If you check their facebook page you will find many other complaints about service and offers to call the manager. \u00a0Don't bother, just find somewhere else to enjoy your brunch.",

Next time I'll also be sure to try one of the juices that sounded really good and creative (and filling) though this particular day I needed to get my caffeine in (also great btw, including the foam design). Liked the decor and definitely would want to come back for dinner or even just a drink. As much as I liked the communal atmosphere via the long tables, I did feel a bit too close to my neighbor immediately in the next seat, especially since the company I came with sat opposite me (farther than my next seat neighbor which required repeats and conversing over our neighbors).",

    "text": "I don't get why this place is so busy.I wanted to come for brunch on a Saturday but found when I tried to book Friday night that the only availability was for 9am. Okay, fine. Breakfast, it is!Arrived at 9am, and the place was empty.The menu featured your bog-standard breakfast/brunch fare with one or two more inspired options. I opted for poached eggs on wholemeal toast (\u00a35.50) with a side of streaky bacon (\u00a33), along with a white americano (\u00a32.30). The eggs were perfectly poached and covered with a sprinkling of chopped chives, sitting on a single slice of relatively small wholemeal toast. I was a bit disappointed, I won't lie. The streaky bacon was perfectly cooked and actually came in an impressive serving size. The americano was far and away less enjoyable than the americano I got from Kaffeine across the street prior to breakfast, which had the same price point of \u00a32.30.But what I really don't get is the fact that the place was still half empty by the time I left at around 11am. Perhaps don't believe them when they say they don't have any bookings for weekend mornings and just show up and see if you can get a table. Or perhaps just sit at the bar - it would probably have been less cold than our table that was constantly barraged by blasts of cold air from the perpetually open front door.And the service was just the wrong side of stuffy and uptight. Although I suppose it could be argued that there is never a good side of stuffy and uptight. What I'm saying is that the service was stuffy and uptight, alright?There's certainly better value-for-money breakfast/brunch places in London than this one. And you won't even have to book. Or worry about the draft. Or put up with aloof, inattentive service. Try Ozone, Caravan or Workshop Coffee for a start.",

All inventive and fresh ingredients. Both the food and drinks are very fair prices .. with the quality i would expect everything to be more expensive... but the fact that it isn't makes me want to go there all the time.Sitting at the bar watching food come out.... even as a vegetarian couldnt help finding the meat to look beautiful and delicious. I had the veggie tart.. every bit of which was just perfection. There are also lots of light bite options perfect for accompanying drinks. The menu is packed without being overwhelming or confusing.The hot fudge sundae with honeycomb chunks covered in hot chocolate might have been the best thing i have ever had in my life.All the servers and staff were so nice... really attentive and respectful when you don't want the attention. Again.. would have expected it to be a bit snooty but did not find that at all. Also you can see into the Kitchen and all looks so perfectly relaxed and clean... even on a sold out Saturday night all seemed to be beyond in control.Down to the details again.. the bathroom has the best smelling handsoap / lotion ever... and personal hand dryer, sink, mirror in each stall which is really the best thing ever.Literally cannot find one fault in the place.",

    "text": "This place was awful. We arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday & the place was empty, before we sat down we jokingly said to each other \"I wonder if they'll be able to seat us\". Yet, when we asked for a table they acted like they had to see if they had room for us when the whole entire restaurant was free. When over 80% of it was empty. The wait staff was pretty incompetent and they seemed to be arguing with each other and even though there was barely anyone there the whole time we were there they were less then helpful & numerous times ignored us. They started serving dinner at 6pm we asked if we could order some small plates until 6pm and then order dinner, the waitress said she had to check and see if they needed a table (which we had just sat down at), to which I replied \"you mean you were going to kick is out in less then 30 minutes?\". It was some of the worst service I've had in a very long time, which is why I felt compelled to write a review. Also another server did not speak English, which is fine except he got our order wrong three times because of it, you should at least learn the language of the menu if you are going to be a waitperson. The food itself was mediocre at best, we were planning on staying for dinner but the shoddy food combined with the horrible service we decided to leave and had a wonderful dinner elsewhere.",

He didn't seem to understand the menu itself too much (probably a reflection of how new the place was at the time), but as such had to repeat our order back to us several times before he got it right.Then we had sirloin steaks with fries and bearnaise, which just left me a little uninspired. The meat was overdone (since I'd asked for it medium rare), the sauce was tasteless and my chips were soggy. I *love* good steak, and was really disappointed.We then sampled a raspberry and rhubarb fool, and a honeycomb sundae. The former was fine, but just fine - and the latter was way too sweet and busy.Shame, since it's so close to where I work, but I haven't been back since and don't intend to. I'd rather see them do tapas really well, or a more traditional menu, not both with less than impressive results.",

And I am still, to this point, slightly unsure of whether I am completely sold on what they have to offer.I have had incredibly good visits here and have felt that the standard of food and service are well worth the pricetag.I have had just as many visits where I have finished my meal and thought \"Wow, that was bland. Holy cow, that is a large bill for average food\".Hence, the Riding House Cafe gets three stars.On my last visit, the service was pretty shocking. Our waitress seemed to be half asleep/still drunk from the night before/stoned. She was a friendly person, but totally inept. We waited ages to place orders and there were many instances where we just gave up on additional drinks orders, as she was not paying attention. The final insult was having to wait an eternity for the bill to arrive and have a large amount of service automatically placed on the total.There are some really good. Items on the menu and these are the components that have made me return time and again. The drinks are pretty good, but definitely overpriced.The decor and ambience here are very good, but most definitely not the place to come if you feel like having a quiet breakfast or dinner. The open plan kitchen and high ceilings, really exemplify the \"clatter factor\"!The Riding House Cafe is potentially a really great place. However, I expect more for this pricetag.",

But every single time, without fail, all of my daft American friends want to go someplace and have fish and chips. \"Hey, I heard this place has fish and chips.\" \"Have you had the fish and chips here?\" \"Man, we gotta go into London and get some fish and chips.\" We're in one of the largest cities in the world; I think we can do a little better.Which is why I was lucky to have a local friend take us to Riding House Caf\u00e9, not because it's good British food, but because it's good food, period. British-influenced, almost certainly, but like much modern cooking, there's a wealth of other influences in there, too.There were five of us, and we decided to go to town on the small plates. We must have tried half the menu, and while there were certainly favorites (the pork belly was cooked perfectly) and even a few flops (the heirloom tomato side was more of a salad, and was pretty light on the tomatoes), the overall consensus was very good. I would say that what struck me the most was the timing on when the dishes were brought to the table - it was done in two waves, and I think more thought could have been taken to figure out which plates would have been more appropriate to being out first. As it was, we were hit with all of the heavy meat dishes during the first wave, and after cleaning those, a lot of the veg came out in round two. I would have liked to have had that reversed.Without reservations, we were able to walk into the restaurant and grab a table with the explicit instructions that we had to be finished within an hour and a half because the table was then reserved. We were only twenty minutes late, for which I do feel a bit badly, but I put just as much blame on Riding House for making their food so tasty. Sometimes, as much as we might try, you can't rush a good meal with friends.",

    "text": "This place came high recommended by a colleague and I had to make bookings two weeks in advance. That to me is a sign that this is a good restaurant. So I was really looking forward to trying it out. I loved the space as soon as I walked in, it has that rustic comfort that I favor. However, I was quite disappointed with the food. We went on Sunday at noon and I was hoping to have the avocado toast that was so talked about. However, I was informed that was for breakfast and they don't serve it for brunch. What? That is very strange to me. You really can't serve me the toast that was available just 30 minutes ago? Oh well, so the group of us ordered salads and some other small dishes to share. The salads were fine, but the small dishes were quite mediocre.",

    "text": "So disappointing. I was looking forward to this Sunday brunch having lots of good things about the place.First we book a few days in advance and could only get a table at 2pm. I chose the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon while my friend had the hashbrown chorizo. There was barely anything on my plate and it was put together in the most simplistic way. It looked like my 17 years old brother had cooked eggs and thrown on the plate two slides of smoked salmon and a piece of white baguette. Awful.I asked for a fruit salad and they said they do not have fruit salad in the brunch menu? really what kind of brunch menu does not have fruits?I only give two stars because my friend seemed satisfied of her hashbrowns and mini donuts for dessert. Otherwise it would have been one.In a nutshell: I left hungry",

    "text": "On a lazy Sunday morning, my companion and I made this a destination for brunch-he had been here before, but warned me that it was always crowded and had advised me to get a reservation before arriving. Upon our attempt to actually book a table the previous night, we unfortunately discovered that the place was booked solid for the time that we wanted (around 10am) and there were no other times within two hours available.Undeterred, we made our way over and were informed that there was a table for two available, but we had to leave by 12:45. That was fine. The reataurant was absolutely PACKED--due to the silence in the streets surrounding it, I was prepared for an equally silent restaurant, but it was buzzing with full tables. The menu is easy to read and includes a wide variety of breakfast and brunch options, as well as an all-day menu that wasn't open for Sunday brunch. THe prices range from \u00a36 to \u00a310 for a main--I, from starting a vegan diet two weeks ago, could only have the avocado on toast--I ordered that with a side of mushrooms (2\u00a3 is a bit of a hefty price to pay for about three large mushrooms though) and an apple, beetroot, carrot, and ginger juice.The toast came with a lemon wedge and a little pot of vinegar (I was a little confused about how to eat it, but upon sprinkling a little on the toast, it definitely brightened the flavor and you could definitely taste the black pepper). The juice was cold pressed and absolutely delicious, as were the mushrooms.The service was superb--our water glasses were filled multiple times and the servers all seemed pleasant and happy to serve us.",

From booking - which we did a few days before and could only be allocated a slot at 2pm so were starving when we arrived - to the brunch choices which were few and far between, I've been to cheaper and smaller places with better and more extensive choices and to the portions - small to say the least and we were two women dining so I can't imagine how guys would deal with it! \u00a0I had the large eggs benedict and PB& J to drink which were both delicious but the food too small a portion. My friend however had a salad with king prawns and we were disgusted when the bill came to see that her salad was \u00a39 before they added the prawns which then were \u00a34 more! When it came time to pay we were then interrogated as to why we didn't want to pay the discretionary service charge and we said about the portions and salad cost, etc. Also we didn't feel the service we received was worthy of a \u00a35 charge especially as we were served by three staff and it wasn't exceptional and one had a bit of an aloof attitude and there was the feeling that you were being rushed in and out. We liked the furniture and distressed / retro design of the restaurant but I wouldn't return and was highly disappointed and hungry after my first and last visit. Such a shame! Very close walking distance from Oxford Circus tube station.",

I got two side plates for 12 pounds and the amount of food I managed to consume was the size of an apple. AN APPLE! The waitress was lovely and was kind enough to constantly refill my glass with water. My glass however was filthy. The woman at the table next to me found a fly cooked into her hamburger. Not exactly appetizing. My food appeared to be fine (except for the lack of food to consume). I think this place is really good for brunch. Brunch is fabulous. I will try again but not for dinner.

This meant that a) everyone ordered muesli/fruit and no one had seconds, and b) I was too busy scribbling notes to enjoy the food anyway. What was I thinking?!Thankfully I fixed this by taking some fellow double-brunch fans on a Saturday morning. Their eggs florentines and my chorizo hash brown kept us quiet (for once) as we got stuck in; my huge hash brown was happily teamed up with two poached eggs, spinach and mushrooms, but be warned it's pretty heavy. As in, won't need to eat until tomorrow kinda heavy (although I did). Helped it digest with a yummy ABC Ginger juice in an attempt to be healthy (apple, beetroot and carrot I think).For seconds we shared two helpings of the buttermilk pancakes, with berries, clotted cream and pour-your-own syrup - cue some 'strategic' division between three of us (i.e. I nabbed as many blueberries as poss). Try them if you have any room left; firm but fluffy at the same time, they hit the spot for me.We just found the service a bit lax - it started off nice and smiley, but when we weren't ready to order about a minute after we got the menu, that didn't mean they had to give us another 20 minutes to decide! We also got the wrong table's food at first (though these things happen) and it was pretty difficult to get anyone's attention throughout, even though we could see a row of 3 servers chatting at their station on the other side of the room.No biggie really as we weren't in any rush to go back into the monsoon outside, but it did leave me feeling like it lacked a bit of heart, so just falls short of a 4-star 'yay' - given all the inviting cutesy d\u00e9cor inside I think it missed an easy chance to be really charming.",

The menu at the Riding House is pretty varied, you can go for sweet or savoury depending on whether you fancy pancakes or eggs - always a tough choice in my mind - and they do really great smoothies which are served in milk bottles.

The anxious conformism displayed for one, and the head-in-hands lack of originality for another. At best it seems to result in venues little different from each other. At worst it seems to be prompting some restaurant chains (e.g. Balans) to ditch their strengths (quality, value, service) in favour of apeing \u00a0Bill's in all but name.Anyway, I digress. Evidently Riding House Cafe's interior does not break the mould for brunch places. How about its food? Little different I think, ranging from run-of-the-mill (the Eggs Royale I had), to above-average (a 'Super food' salad, the name of which causes me to grimace). Overall? Just about A-OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.",

Loved it.The seabass is also good but its a hassle to fiddle with as it's the whole fish. Everything we ate was a winner. \u00a0Spent one NYE here by chance as our last min plans changed and it was such a great time. No ridiculous crowd and a nice chill spot to bring in the New Year. The atmosphere and decor is great! It's not a cheap eat but definitely worth it.If you don't have reservations I wouldn't come during the busy periods because the wait is quite long.",

My four star review may come more from smiling back on past conversations or just the general morning vibe you get during weekday mornings of media/advertising/social folks coming in for business meetings and a chat.Though I've had dinner and drinks a couple times at Riding House, this wouldn't be my recommended time for going. I've found the sharing plate/tapa style comes out too small and are inconsistent with their portions (honestly, it feels the more you drink there the less food you get by the end of the night!). \u00a0That being said, if you're craving either British or American style breakfast - this place has got it down. With all the hype (I don't know why) still out there on Breakfast Club - if you're looking for some actually great American style pancakes and French toast - you'll be happier here!",

I was so close to giving 5* for this restaurant, but the other dishes I tried weren't as good. I also got the racer juice (espresso, almond milk, banana, etc) which was surprisingly refreshing. A lot of times espresso flavoured juices can be overpowered by the caffeine but this was well balanced. Would recommend and there is a great coffee shop (Kaffeine) across the street while you wait for your table.",

Far enough away from the crazy tourist crowds to feel like a bit of a local haunt. Also a great jumping-off point if you're spending the day in Regents Park or Marylebone.Came here at 1pm on a Saturday without a reservation, and managed to snag a table for three with the caveat that we had to be out within 1.5 hours. This proved to not be a problem, as the service was fairly swift. I had the chorizo hash, friends both had the avocado benedict - both were fairly tasty. My flat white was pretty average, but had a delicious \"Boris Bike\" smoothie with almond milk that filled me up almost as much as the brunch itself. Decor was great and staff really friendly.",

However they seemed to have gone for style over substance, typified by their menu. There were rather confusing different sections for different times of day. But the worst part was the lack of basic labelling (vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, contains nuts etc) and or any real descriptiors of the food. For example, I ordered the 'Superfood and Herb' salad with added haloumi cheese. The menu had no description of which superfoods were included, and the waitress couldn't shed much light (although I didn't push it). When the salad arrived it was rather conspicuous in it's lack of herbs. The food was however pretty decent. But I don't think I'll be back as I don't like the Russian roulette feeling to the menu.

She then got rowdy and started insulting me, all the while the door lady was just standing there.We waited for 15 minutes to be seated at the bar...Unhappy about that, when people who had been behind us in the line got actual tables.The menu was ok. The only reason we stayed was that my boyfriend really wanted to try their buttermilk pancakes (which were actually really good).I ordered one eggs Benedict, and after seeing someone's food went by, asked if it was at all possible to change my order. Our waiter/bartender was able to do this which I really appreciated.What I ended up eating was a 'chorizo hashbrown with poached eggs'.Overall it was good, but the entire potato hashbrown was soggy (was it meant to be like that?) and the chorizo left wet patches over it. Eggs were cooked almost perfectly though.",

The only thing is that the service can be quite slow so if you're in a rush, it's not the place to be. As you will have probably had to wait for your reservation, take your time and enjoy the ambiance!I had the chorizo hashbrowns which were really nice as there was plenty of chorizo in them and the hashbrowns were really cripsy. A friend had the eggs benedict which while tasty wasn't very filling and we were glad to have gotten some pastries on the side. The avocado on toast was pretty good! The coffee was average which is a big disappointment. As someone who really likes to get a good kick it was quite weak. The smoothies on the other hand were really flavourful and a pretty good size, even if they are a bit on the pricey side. I \u00a0had been looking forward to going here for quite some time and I wasn't disappointed. If I were taking friends from outside the city, this is definitely a good option as it's a nice experience but it isn't the first place I'd rush back to for my usual weekend brunch as it's a little more expensive than other places which are just as good.",

    "text": "The Riding House provided exactly what I needed at the exact moment I needed it: a fantastic, post-dinner espresso martini.Every time I raised that glorious glass to my lips, the smell of those gorgeous coffee beans hit me and reminded me how awesome espresso martinis can be. I'm not kidding, that was the best-smelling cocktail I've had in a long time.An hour later I was ready to switch to something less caffeinated and the bartender was very helpful in recommending a good segue from espresso booze to sleep (particularly impressive since my gluten-free limitation meant no whiskey or bourbon). In the end we settled on a courvoisier old fashioned. The bar, which runs the length of the narrow restaurant, was packed at 930 but we wrangled a stool (some of the heaviest and most awkward ever) by staying eagle-eyed. By 1130 it had thinned out, we were sufficiently drunk, and we'd enjoyed just the right atmosphere to chat conspiratorially on all things awesome. The Riding House was great for what we were there for: drinks, seats and lively environment.",

In other words, typical London/Europe.Finally, I ordered the superfood salad (with no description on the menu). A nice-sized portion of broccoli florets, quinoa, red cabbage and sweet potato. I loved the vinaigrette on top. I also had the violetta artichokes, with rocket, lemon and honey. A nice-sized portion again for an appetizer. The flavors played off each other nicely. So expect very good food, but crappy service.",

Must say, I really enjoyed everything. My only small gripe was the chorizo in my chorizo hash. I'm a Sonoran Desert dweller, so I expected a bit more spice and a totally different texture, but it wasn't bad. It just wasn't Mexican, and the hash was not crispy what-so-ever. The poached egg, however, was perfect. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but it could be better. Another plus is that we just popped in Friday evening after shopping. No reservation and they were able to seat us. Have to appreciate that.",

The second time we came on a Wednesday night with no reservations they told us the wait would probably be an hour but I am pretty sure we only waited about 30 minutes or less and we sat at the bar.The only dish that I don't care for much is the artichoke dip. It is quite tiny and the flavors and textures are lacking. Everything else I have tried though has been delish!

Not to disappoint, The Riding House welcomed us in at about 5:30pm and finished serving our food around 8:30pm for a 3 course meal. People had already begun to trickle out slowly - first those with kids, then those with lives, finally those stragglers picking away at the last pieces of cheesecake.The ambiance of the restaurant was cool - a single metal pipe connected an overhanging chandelier. The room was wooden (like a barn), chairs made of leather which looked like it could've come out of a car from the '60s and there were photos of horses behind wooden panels.The food was also not bad - beef wellington, carver chicken, hake, kale, wings, artichoke dip, NYC cheesecake. All quite good and would highly recommend it.If you get a chance, come check the place out, just make sure it's a long chance.",

It's a busy road but not an obvious one, and the Riding House Cafe attracts a crowd of people working nearby - at least during the week, I haven't been here at the weekend.On most visits it has been quiet which makes it great for a casual coffee. Evenings and lunches are a different story and the place can be quite packed.Apparently, they are well known for their pancakes. So much so that they were recommended in a feature about less obvious Shrove Tuesday treats ... should have guessed that this would translate in a bit of a run on pancakes, but didn't! So, this was turning into a bit of a nightmare visit. All tables were booked and the only space available at the bit of the bar that backs onto the open kitchen. Apparently they had hundreds of people come through the door since morning and made use of every chair available, but this wasn't going to work. Then again, the pancakes leaving the kitchen looked amazing ... \u00a0note to self for next year, make sure to book a table!!Thanks to the super attentive staff we did get a table after a reasonable wait, just in time for our super berry buttermilk pancakes to be served. Bit of a weird lunch choice (no savoury options, this is not a creperie or Dutch pancake house after all), but delicious!All's well that ends well, we left fat and happy.",

It was not any of the comments above, but it didn't knock the ball out of the park. A bit pricey too considering there is nothing on the plate besides a few greens. My particular beef wellington was not tightly wrapped and a little bit cold too.We also ordered the lobster lasagna and it was a bit bland, nothing too impressive. Ordered some small plates. a quail dish and a cauliflower hummus dish, really not a lot going on and very small portions.It was very good ambiance and decor, but would not make a return visit.

I really liked my cappuccino as well. One of the better coffees I've had at a brunch place. Service was good and prompt. Our waitress was polite and very capable at managing all the tables. Ambience was also nice - spacious and well decorated. Would be suitable for any sort of occasion. Overall, definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and was quite pleased. We were meeting some family for a bite and it was a convenient meeting place. The only issue was that they were quite busy and we were lingering over coffee catching up. The server requested that we pay and leave as they needed the table. My only suggestion would be don't come here if you want a long leisurely brunch - they are on quite a schedule.The coffee, juices and smoothies were great. The juices were a little on the pricey side but everyone thought they tasted wonderful.I ordered the crunola parfait and a side of toast. I didn't love the crunola but that was partially my fault. I expected more of a granola base rather than seeds. I should have asked prior to ordering. My cousin ordered the avocado toast and it looked delish! I would definitely be willing to come back for a quick breakfast or a sandwich at lunch. My cousin believes she will be back again as well.",

    "text": "A very New York style, beautifully designed cafe/restaurant. The only difference is that they do not do bottomless (all you can drink) brunch.The service has the same attentiveness as a New Yorker Cafe (you wait at the front, they set you, only certain people can take your order and one specific person looks after your area) and you can book a tables even for breakfast. The menu is a little on the ex-y side but you are paying for not just breaky but the whole experience so I think it is worth it. The menu has everything you need to start the day- av (and feta and eggs if you please) on toast, full English, full veg (one of the best that I have ever had), hash browns, bircher and some 'creative things'. All done in a way that is one step up from usual. My only food complaint is that they have not nailed the runny egg. Hence 4 stars. They have a range of breakfast cocktails and, of course, a blood mary that will sort your hangover out. The coffee is pretty good- it's not quite at Australian standard, but it's about a 3.8/5. The seats are super comfortable and all of the furnishings are so soft and hard to pull yourself away from. There is one large table down the centre of the restaurant which is used as a share table, there is seating at the bar (very luxurious stools) and then there is a very, very comfy velvety bench around the side. If you are booking ask for the bench part it's the best for people watching too.",

Although the restaurant wasn't partiular busy this Bank Holiday lunchtime, we were initially asked every two miutes if we were ready to order yet (possibly due to the 1.5 hour table turnover deadline they state on their website applies at lunchtime) but then, once having made our choices we were left nursing empty drinks glasses as the tables around us \u00a0who were seated later than we were \u00a0all received their food. Cocktail refills requested as mains arrived were delivered at the same time as the dessert menu meaning we skipped anything else, paid up and went for sweet and coffee elsewhere.

    "text": "Complete review and pictures to be found here hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 The Riding House Cafe, North of Oxford Circus,is one of the most enchanting places I have been to in a long time. As an all day restaurant it comprises of a more formal restaurant corner,large shared tables perfect for brunch and comfy sofas for the afternoon coffee or pre-dinner cocktail. The overall decor and the attention to detail is remarkable. The generous room shows a number of different textures such as stone,steel,wood and tiles and is filled with antique mismatched furniture interspersed with modern pieces. Wherever you look you can find charming accessories a grandmother lamp,a weird statue or some other knickknack. Particularly thoughtful I found that they disguised the Dixon hand-dryer at the Ladies'with a fake-antique metal cover. So nothing but praise for the interior of The Riding House Cafe. I just wish they had put as much emphasis on the food as they had on their design. This seems to be a common problem also of the other 2 places by the same owner,namely The Garrison and Village East (both at Bermondsey Street). All three restaurants are pushing the boundaries regarding their design and concept,while staying on the too safe side with their food. The Riding House Cafe has just like everybody else at the moment embraced the small plate concept,serving 5 or 6 dishes each for 3,4 or 5 pounds. Instead of entirely focusing on perfecting its 'tapas',it also offers a conventional menu with burgers,steak and fish and chips. We decided to stick with the small plates. The quality of the bread served is very often an omen for things to come and this proved true also for this occasion. Competitively priced for \u00a31.5,the bread was unfortunately bland and starchy. The artichoke puree it came with was ok,but I have no urge to ever eat it again. Our clear favourite was the most low-profile dish we had ordered,namely the roasted butternut squash with sage and chili (3.5). Even though we asked for extra chili,it was not the least spicy,but nevertheless tasted beautiful and fresh and I loved the combination of sage and squash. However,this dish was a very simple one and even I with my very limited cooking skills might be able to pull it off. I have a compulsion to order beetroot when it is anywhere on the menu. The Riding House Cafe beetroot carpaccio (3) came with sheeps ricotta (too mild) and merlot vinagraitte (too sour). With a lot of salt and pepper it was almost decent. The chicory,pear and gorgonzola salad (3) was definitely not the most exciting dish I have ever eaten. It consisted of a few leaves of chicory,some slices of pear and a few cubes of gorgonzola. You might have guessed by now that it didn't come with any additional seasoning,sauce,vinaigrette,. If you like your food very much stripped down to basics,you might really love the dishes at The Riding House Cafe. Or maybe you still mightn't actually. Again on the bland side was the seabass ceviche (5). It was swimming in olive oil but lacked the zesty citrus flavour that I associate with ceviche (ceviche is to my knowledge raw fish that is marinated in lemon juices) as well as some chili. It was by all means edible,it just lacked any kind of wow-factor. The Steak Tartare (5) was again a dish without character. I don't dispute the quality of the meat which was undoubtedly very good if cut too coarsely and consequently 'sticking between your teeth'tough. While I don't like steak tartare that it drowned in worcester sauce or other condiments,I still expect some chili kick or at least salt or pepper Now let's talk about the service. I am very embarrassed to admit that I was scared of the waitress. She was about half my size (and I am not exactly a big girl) but she was so brusque and bossy! She brought us the things that she thought were appropriate very quickly,while we waited in vain for everything else. For example,we never got our salt and pepper (you might have gathered by now that salt and pepper were crucial components of this meal) which I finally had to forage from some table at the other end of the restaurant. She was not exactly a bad waitress,but I am sure she is better in her day job as a prison warden or primary school teacher. It seems The Riding House Cafe is afraid of flavouring and seasoning its food,which is a shame as a lot of the dishes are almost there. I prefer to have a meal with some divine dishes and some that went a bit wrong to small plate boredom. To stand out in the competitive London restaurant scene,one has to take at least a little bit of a risk and this is something The Riding House Cafe is certainly not doing. I would be perfectly happy to go back and spend a whole Sunday afternoon on one of the comfy sofas with a good novel or the Sunday papers while having some tea and then maybe a glass of wine or two. However,I think I would move on for dinner.",

Food was delicious but I was starving and wolfed it all down with it barely touching the sides so I'm nto sure how qualified I am to comment. My favourite of the small plates were the lamb and the sea bass cerviche. I would probably skip the squid and chorizo, although they are two of my fav ingrediants the chorizo completely overwhelms the delicate squid reducing it to just another texture in tomatoey sauce. The pork belly (and this will probably sound like \"duh, what did you expect from pork belly\") was just too fatty. I think I'm over pork belly, it made me feel slightly sick although the crackling was lovely and crispy. Best dessert undoubtably the chocolate semifreddo, my friend definately \"won\" the dessert round! But overall very nice, and I would go back.",

    "text": "I got to know about this place from the Kaffeine blog (kaffeinelondon.blogspot.\u2026 and twitter.com/kaffeinelond\u2026 ) some weeks ago. Finally on a sunny bank holiday I decided to give it a try, and as it was just two weeks after the Riding House Cafe opened I was happy to get 50% off the food. When I entered the Riding House Cafe I was actually surprised. It is very light inside, it did not look like that when I looked over there sometimes while sitting in Kaffeine. The interior looks a bit old fashioned, but that's part of the concept I guess. In general it looks like a nice place, though I was happy to sit on a cozy sofa. The waiters are very friendly and always keep your glass of water full. Nice detail. I tried the cheese burger and it was really good. But in my opinion at least the burgers are a bit overpriced. You could get better burgers for less money in London. So I am not completely convinced that the burger are worth the price, but with 50% off it definitely was and in general it tasted quite good. But what were even better than the burger itself were the hand-crafted chips that came with it!And the rose wine I had for my lunch was actually not expensive, and I would say it's worth going there to just enjoy the rose wine at a sunny day.But what definitely even topped the rose wine was the Chocolate Praline Semi Freddo. Simply delicious - and not pricy at all! So, if you want to spend some time at the Riding House Cafe and not spend a lot of money on food, go there for a rose wine and a dessert. It's delicious for a very good price! :)I will definitely go there again for the rose and the dessert ... Oh, and one more thing: I also had the impression that it's a bit a posher place ... but somehow not too posh actually.",

I'm smitten with the details, and even the petrol blue chairs lining the bar got me excited. I loved that there was the same blue dotted about the place - in the candles, in the water glasses. The attention to detail here is impressive. We didn't eat, but I did order some fresh mint tea (I was hungover, you see). Turns out that fresh mint tea is basically mint leaves in hot water. And I'd have mocked at the \u00a32.40 price tag if it hadn't rid me of my sloshly sickly hungover tummy. Magic. The only annoying thing? Water pourers. This is something that's happening more and more in London, and I hate it. There's a jug of water on the table. We have arms. I can pour my own water. I don't need anyone popping back when I've put my glass down to top me up. If I wanted more water, I'd pour more water. It's hard to have a conversation when someone is hovering about the table. And weirdly, the service wasn't particularly attentive the rest of the time. I will come back and eat here, in fact, I can't wait. But I really hope that the service has sorted itself out when I do - it's not quite there yet and the cafe is too pretty to have sub-par service.",

Admittedly, it's probably the busiest night of the week and were told our table was paying up and asked to wait by the bar. Having ordered two bottles of wine between 6 of us, we hung around the bar for about 15 mins before asking how much longer our table would be. We were told that it was being set up so we headed back to the bar, expecting to be called at any moment. Another 10 mins passed and still nothing. Having approached one of the hosts again, we were told that it was going to be a few more minutes. I hate being lied to by hosts.35 mins after our alloted reservation, we were finally seated at our table in the main dining room. The waitress did apologise for the wait before giving out menus.We ordered a selection of small tapas-style dishes to all share and then main courses each.The salted cod croquettes were nice but a little cold by the time it arrived. The roast pork belly was delicious \u00a0crispy skin and tender meat. The goats cheese curd (seemingly ultra popular and trendy right now) was also really tasty but the veal sausage was just so-so.My main course was the chorizo hash brown with poached egg \u00a0more of a brunch dish in my view \u00a0but was very good with a perfectly poached egg on top. Others liked about the foie gras burger (although one friend complained he couldn't taste or find the foie gras!!) and the accompanying french fries were top notch.A good wine list and inventive cocktails as well as a smattering of classic ones, the drinks were certainly flowing.In the end, we had a good time but perhaps that was because we were so hungry that everything tasted pretty good. Still, worth a try, perhaps on a quieter night!",

    "text": "From the team that brought you my favourite neighbourhood locals, The Garrison and Village East, comes the Riding House Cafe, an all day brasserie located in the heart of Fitzrovia. Sitting a few streets back from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street, the Riding House Cafe is the perfect lunch spot after blitzing through the nearby high street stores. The Brasserie had a great ambiance - bright and airy, decked out with vintage decor which was reminiscent of The Garrison, and staff offering welcomed smiles as we came through the door. The menu was made up of small plates designed to be shared as starters, and a variety of mains which seemed to cover off all the major food groups and more. It was lunch time after all, and my friend and I were starving, so we ordered 5 starters, 2 mains and a side of mash - all washed down with a cold glass of Prosecco of course! Notably delicious were the Pork belly - nice flavours and great crackling, and the Chorizo with Squid. Oh my!! The sauce was so incredibly tasty, we shamefully asked for some bread so we could mop the sauce up like proper ladies that lunched, as opposed to licking the plate. For the mains, I definitely didn't have any food envy with my incredible Chorizo Hash topped with two wonderfully poached eggs. They were DELISH! To top off our meal, we ordered the hot fudge sundae to share. Rich with chocolate fudge sauce, and devilishly sweet from the chunks of honeycomb and macaroons, this was a glass of naughtiness. And we were defeated. Overall, the meal was very good at reasonable prices - especially with 50% off food during their soft openings offer which runs till the start of May. Service was swift and friendly, albeit hit and miss - but then again it was only day 2 since opening, so no doubt this will improve over the weeks to come. I look forward to coming back - this time to include some of their inviting cocktails that were on the menu. For full review and pictures, please visit gourmetbelly.wordpress.c\u2026",

    "text": "The interior is nice but a little confused, reminiscent of the coffee shop in Frasier but a little more shabby chic. The bathrooms are lovely and have nice products but seem to be Mad Men meets Steampunk.Met some friends for brunch, had the fish and chips, it was pretty good standard fish and chips, the tartare was good too. Tried to order a few different drinks but they were having problems with one of the chillers I think, so ended up just getting a slightly overpriced cider.My friends ordered the kedgeree, which looked amazing and a selection of the small plates which come in various sizes of small, but really are quite tiny on the whole.On the whole, I liked the place, and would recommend.",

I absolutely loved their full and proper british breakfast and I would give this place more stars were it not for my fellow brunchers who were less fond of their nauseating eggs royale and minuscule slice of grapefruit. The wait staff was very friendly and courteous, but it was difficult to get their attention.",

Service was attentive and the prices were quite reasonable. Quality of the food was high, as was the comfort and design aesthetic of the space and proximity to Oxford Street. Probably an excellent spot to run away from the holiday shopping crowds!",

    "text": "A co-worker recommended the Riding House Cafe a few weeks back so I decided to give this new restaurant a try. \u00a0It started as a not-so-great experience and if it hadnt' been so...I would have given 5 stars. \u00a0I realize that image is everything w/a restaurant and you want your hostesses to be hot/fashionable/fabulous...but the 4 girls manning the table just seemed self-absorbed and obnoxious. \u00a0I asked if we could get a table and she said the wait was 45 minutes. \u00a0When I asked about the bar, \u00a0it was like a game of telephone...she looked to the girl at her left...who looked to the girl to her left...who looked to the girl to her left. \u00a0The girl on the FAR left looks to the girl on her right....and says 30 minutes...who in turn looks to the girl to her right........you get the point. \u00a0She couldn't speak to me directly....guess she was the most senior hostess and didn't deal with customers. \u00a0They were very rude and lacking in any sort of pleasent customer service. \u00a0My boyfriend could see that I was annoyed so he jumped in and they said they would call us when a spot at the bar was ready. \u00a0We headed to the pub across the street (which was great with a VERY nice barman...not pretentious at all I must say) and enjoyed a couple pints. \u00a0When we hadn't heard from them...we walked back over about 45 minutes later. \u00a0They had forgotten about us but had a table ready so I moved on from my silent rage.Once we got sat down, \u00a0the experience changed. \u00a0Our server was lovely and very well informed about the menu. \u00a0The food was FANTASTIC...I would go so far as to say the best I have had in London since moving here a year ago. I enjoyed the 8 oz Aberdeen Angus Sirloin Steak with Bernaise Sauce which was AMAZING. \u00a0 On the side, we enjoyed roast butternut squash with chilli and sage. \u00a0These were one of the highlights of the meal as they had the density of potatoes and were flavored beautifully! \u00a0The restaurant itself is very upscale but doesn't present itself that way. \u00a0It is decorated in a very modern yet rustic way with wood long tables and amazing lighting. \u00a0I would definitely go back as the food is worth the headache of the hostest staff.",

Portions are perfect for a hungry weekend breakfast appetite, offer is of good quality and arrives hot, and the OJ is very healthy and refreshing.

    "text": "The lunch and dinner menu is more substantial than the Cafe moniker might suggest. Plates of small sharing food occupy the top half of the menu, neatly priced at \u00a33, \u00a34 or \u00a35, a popular recent trend and here pleasingly priced. It's a bit all over the shop with no clear style; Moroccan nestles with continental bistro classics, Eastern treats sit next to solid British bites. That being said, there are some simple gems there and it's easy to eat substantially for \u00a312 - \u00a315, priced well for the local office market as a weekly treat. I'd have trouble defining anything as perfect, but there's nothing that doesn't need just a small tweak from the army of chefs on show. Squid and chorizo came in a spicy tomato sauce with fresh olives, slightly too many flavours for the well cooked but subtle squid. Roasted butternut squash with sage and (sadly unnoticeable) chilli should have had a little more crisp to it for my money, but for three quid it's hard to complain. Other 'smalls' sampled include a very competent lamb with a superbly spicy aubergine puree and a tasty if slightly dry pork belly - three big cubes made a good enough impression for me to put it down to teething troubles and a minute too long under the heat lamps. The final two dishes continue the slightly odd world tour. Tuna ceveche, that lime 'cooked' tartare from Latin America, was another substantial portion well doused in spice and flavour (though lacking a little in lime according to The International Man of Mystery), and a steak tartare, a favourite of mine, here slightly over 'prepared' (ie pre-mixed with a touch too many capers, onions and herbs), it was difficult for the beef to shine, but I'd certainly give it another go.Spread over two lunches, I also had time to sample the Tichfield Burger. An all too rarely seen sloppy mix of darkly pink flesh (I didn't stop and get the breakdown, no doubt others will) cooked medium and nestled plumply on a controversially seeded (and slightly too chewy) bun. It wasn't the worst bun I've had, and was certainly of a good quality, but didn't quite ring true. The meat was excellent. The Tichfield comes topped with a fairly proportioned slice of grilled foie and thinly sliced and slow braised onions, both rendering down and sinking into the juicy meat like an upmarket sloppy joe.",

As a massive breakfast fan, the Riding House Cafe just has everything I need \u00a0impeccably polite staff (well, most of the time), great food and delicious smoothies served in glass milk bottles. The decor is just fabulous \u00a0I rather like the fact that it doesn't look very impressive from the outside, but when you walk inside it blows your mind! My particular favourites are probably the pink window downstairs where you can spy on the chefs and the disturbing stuffed squirrels holding up the lamps. If you're going for breakfast, get the avocado on toast and the sunshine smoothie. Sorted.",

    "text": "I quite liked The Riding House Cafe. I've been here twice so far, primarily because of their opening 50% off food offer, and enjoyed both times I've been here. Food: I like the sharing dishes concept. It allows those of us who want loads of variety to pick all sorts of different kinds of dishes and still keep the costs down. The stand-out dishes, for me, were the roasted pork belly (yummy!), the bread (four thick slices, artichoke dip, all for \u00a31.50 before discount), and the fries that accompanied the Titchfield Burger. The Titchfield Burger in itself was pretty decent, in that I enjoyed it, but, as I'm not a burger connoisseur, and I'd been off meat for a week, you've got to realise I'm not able to give an objective opinion. All I can say was that it came medium rare, it was soft and juicy, it fell apart easily when I cut it, and it more than satisfied my meat cravings, even if the foie gras bit of it was a little hard to find! My Irish friend ordered a whole bunch of oysters and proclaimed them delicious and fantastically priced even at the full price of \u00a32 a piece. Dessert: We shared a chocolate praline semifreddo. That was easily the best part of the meal, even if it took a while to come. The raspberry sauce went very well with the praline, and I loved the nut brittle which came with it. Coffee: I think the coffee comes from Caravan and it was incredible. It could certainly rival the (very good) coffee shop opposite, that's for sure! Decor: Woodsy, relaxed and yet still a little upmarket. Certainly more posh than the 'cafe' part of the name would suggest. Service: Waiters are nice and friendly, although service can be a little on the relaxed side. Our dessert arrived after I finished my coffee, which was a bit of a let-down. Tables have a two hour turnaround which is strictly enforced. My friend and I were shifted to the main bar area once our two hours were up. Verdict: Loved the place, was fantastic value at half-price, would still be pretty good value at full price. Great place to come and relax and just catch up with friends. Just make sure to finish all the food before your two hours are up!",

    "text": "I loved the Riding House Cafe - indeed I would be there eating dinner right now had I not been laid low with horrible flu virus for ages and forced to cancel all my nights out. Sigh. But I really enjoyed my dinner there the night before the dreaded lurgy struck... we went late, after a comedy show and there was a great, buzzy atmosphere. We had booked, but had to wait at the bar for about 15 minutes which was fine, although I was in need of food..anyway we decided to order 3 of the veggie sides between us (roasted root veg, cabbage with chestnut butter and a luscious mac'n'cheese; a great deal for \u00a310) and some fat, juicy prawns with mayo. It was all delicious and left enough room for a majestic chocolate fondant, really oozy and liquid in the centre, exactly how I like it. My friend had hers with the advertised coconut icecream which she said was great too. I'll definitely be going again - once I've knocked the flu on the head. In the meantime, there is some emergency pumpkin cheesecake in the freezer.",
