It is not the least expensive meal you'll ever eat but you really are paying for authentic quality. The cocktails are not a bad price though (\u00a34.50) and if you want to go for broke the Sancerre is very nice (around 28 quid).The service is not exactly smiley - they do take themselves very seriously but it is one of the best chinese restaurants i have come accross in the capital. The portins are generous though, so be careful not to over order.I have only been at the weekend or the evening but I believe they do a lunch special which seems very good value, so if you work around here I can recommend stopping by for a bite. Also the view of the river is pretty special. Be a great place to take visiting parents.",

Just to add, the attitude of some of their waiters is poor - sometimes a little too cocky for their own good. Perhaps a decent view and benefits from being the closest Chinese restaurant from Canary Wharf, but I would say that is about it. For the price charged, there are better options in London.",

I like the Canary Wharf location though, so I'm going to give Royal China one more try when it gets warmer, and have some dim sum by the Thames.",

I know because of the richness of flavors, of tastes, the quality and quantity of ingredients, the freshness of products.Gold crispy fried chicken; or noodles with ginger; prawns or fish even the traditional sweet and sour (either pork or prawns) dish: everything has a richness of flavors that nowhere had I experienced before. Also the Sunday morning Dim Sum experience. Even the long wait on Sunday morning, when they operate a waiting list first to come - first to be served, didn't put me off.To the great foods add a good attentive and quick service, add the nice decor of the restaurant, the comfortable seating and the view of the river. Ideally one should arrive by boat, dock at the Canary Wharf docking station and just get to the chinese food feast!",

    "text": "There aren't many places to go to around the Canary Wharf area if you are looking for Chinese food. Royal China is the most prominent one that is located at Westferry Circus. I came here for dinner a while ago before they had a refurbishment. Pan fried stuffed eggplant with minced shrimp in black bean sauce \u00a39.8Eggplant cooked until it was soft and soaking in the black bean sauce. This had a slight spicy kick to it. Mixed seafood stir fried with fresh milk \u00a314.80When I saw this on the menu, I Just HAD to order it. I mean stir fried fresh milk? The dish came out in a blanket of fluffy snow interspersed with seafood. The texture was like the filling in egg tarts with hints of sweet coconut if I'm not mistaken. I really enjoyed this.Squid with garlic and chilli \u00a311.50This was unmemorable. Overall dinner was satisfying though the prices here are a little more on the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 side. On another occasion, I came back during the May long weekend for some dim sum with friends. Usually this wouldn't be my first pick but they were having a promotion for the month of May with 25% off. With a large table, we got down to ordering and they have some new items introduced into the menu. Where do I begin? Having had dim sum here in the past, I always thought it was respectable if not ever a tad expensive for the quality.Let's start with the newcomers. Underwhelmingly disappointing. The fish dumplings were over steamed and dry. The taro cake was slices of taro that were pressed together but doesn't gel as it should like a turnip cake and lacked any taste. The green tea sponge cake? There are no words. Back to the regulars, the quality and standard were inconsistent with some being good and others disappointing. Compared to my previous visits, there is a distinct drop in quality. \u00a0We finished the dim sum with dessert with one of the party ordering the sago cream with yam and the rest had the sweet dumplings. Desserts itself took over half an hour to arrive and having made these sweet dumplings before, it doesn't take half an hour. When it arrived, I was so disappointed that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The dumpling had a crackling texture instead of being chewy and QQ; the soup did not even have any hint of ginger! Having spent that long waiting for our dessert, it was another 20 minutes for our bill to arrive. With a young child in tow, you bet the little boy was pretty restless by this stage. We finally went to the counter to pay our bill and to our surprise, there was no discount. We queried with the lady who served us and the answer we got was the bill is generated via a machine that is maintained by head office and it seems that head office had excluded the discount from the machine and sales today. Lady, how difficult is it to whip out a calculator and manually write or deduct the discount if your machine is malfunctioning?I don't know about you but when I am greeted by this discount advert sign when walking through canary wharf after the dim sum with no discount, bad service and disappointing food, something is seriously wrong and disappointing here. Misleading advertising is what I will begin with.",

I hate Ping Pong. In the middle? Nothing. Except my cooking from scratch because I happen to live over the road from a Chinese supermarket. Royal China is placed somewhere happily in the middle. Sunday lunch meant that the restaurant (apparently newly refurbished) was full of Chinese families all tucking in to little parcels and lots of noodles. As with most dimsummeries, it's very child-friendly and there's prams and high chairs all over the shop (in an accommodating way, not in a yummy mummy kind of way). But Sunday lunch meant a 20 minute wait. And it was totally worth it. There was three of us, which for the most part meant ordering was successful. No one dish stood out, they were all really very good. Scallop dumplings probably my favourite. Specials aren't much pricier than the usual dishes (and actually, I didn't think they were any better or most interesting). Tea is cheap, staff are friendly. We could have happily ordered more than our three dishes each (actually, we did happily order more) so 12 dishes, plus tea came to a healthy \u00a350 in total. I'm impressed. I'm now on the hunt for ALLTHEDIMDUMINLONDON, but I imagine if I'm on this side of the river (and I frequently am), Royal China will get many visits from me. 50% of which will be hungover on a Sunday afternoon.",

Wanting to order some take away from them I called up and checked they do it - nice woman says yes - they only do delivery on weekdays though.No problems, we think.We work through their website which is half chinese so quite promising in terms of food quality and authentic charm. All the prices are on it even if it still has a page inviting people to their Christmas dinner.My colleague calls back to place the order, about 17 quid for me and 35 quid for him. At the end my colleague asks how much it will be and the telephone man wanders off to get a calculator and then comes back saying it's \u00a3106. Gob-smacked we laugh a bit and say, \"No, really - how much?\".Then he just won't back down. First he says that they are already cooking the first order - which is a bit of blackmail we didn't really need - but that's ok. We know it's just a simple mistake somewhere and then soon we can be enjoying wonderful chinese food.My colleague is trying to find out if the guy has taken down something wrong since the price seems to have doubled so he goes through the items and prices and they're all about right (the rice was 20p more expensive - it doesn't matter when we're talking about a surcharge of \u00a350). So are the quantities. However the guy on the phone keeps on repeating that it's \u00a3106 and that my colleague had better pay this.Then he starts shouting.So my colleague hangs up. Then his mobile goes - yes - they called him back to shout at him some more so my colleague says, \"I don't want to talk to you just now\".After a few minutes of fuming, then he calmly calls up the restaurant again and speaking to the woman who answers the phone he says he had just put in an order and wants to talk to the manager to explain what just happened.Nope - she starts shouting down the phone that he'd better pay for his food and that we owe them \u00a3106. Shouting over my colleagues attempts to explain that we didn't order that much and that we'd got them to repeat the prices and quantities.All I can say is to avoid these stupid bullies. No matter what has happened (and we definitely were right as we confirmed with the first guy) there is no excuse for people shouting down the phone.",

On this occasion, we had various starters, including salt and chili squid (personal favourite), sesame prawn toast and chicken satay. \u00a0The squid didn't disappoint. \u00a0For mains we had deep fried chicken, prawn cakes and Chinese broccoli, Cantonese beef and topped off with Portuguese seafood rice, which is by far the star dish at Royal China. \u00a0I have had this at other restaurants around London, and it is always best here - the seafood tastes fresh and the sauce has the right level of coconut and sweetness - it's well worth trying (although you probably won't see it on the menu...). \u00a0I can't fault the service, the food or the location of this Royal China, since it is right by the river which allows you to have an alfresco meal, if you choose to.",

Don't get me wrong, it's good at what it does, but after all the hype (I'd been told that this restaurant's the only one that comes close to doing dim sum Hong Kong style), the food was a bit of a disappointment. I'm not a dim sum aficionado, I'll admit, but I think I've eaten enough of it in Singapore and Hong Kong to tell what's good and what's not, and, as I said, Royal China serves good food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. What I would definitely recommend is the crispy noodles which were delicious, as well as the spinach in oyster sauce, which was a little on the salty side, but came nicely presented. Admittedly, it as pricey at \u00a39.60 given it was just, well, spinach! The turnip cake was really nice as well. I expected a little better for the baked pork chop with chilli sand salt. Not enough chilli and too much salt, I say. The char siew (roasted pork) - my must-have in any dim sum restaurant - was okay, not the best I've had in London. Service was friendly; they certainly didn't have any issues with my ordering in a combination of Mandarin, Cantonese and English, unlike some of the restaurants in Chinatown. The view from this restaurant is great. It's located right by the river and just incredibly relaxing.",

    "text": "For photos, please go to chopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026 There aren't many places to go to around the Canary Wharf area if you are looking for Chinese food. Royal China is the most prominent one that is located at Westferry Circus.I came here for dinner a while ago before they had a refurbishment.Pan fried stuffed eggplant with minced shrimp in black bean sauce \u00a39.8Eggplant cooked until it was soft and soaking in the black bean sauce. This had a slight spicy kick to it.Mixed seafood stir fried with fresh milk \u00a314.80When I saw this on the menu, I Just HAD to order it. I mean stir fried fresh milk? The dish came out in a blanket of fluffy snow interspersed with seafood. The texture was like the filling in egg tarts with hints of sweet coconut if I'm not mistaken. I really enjoyed this.Squid with garlic and chilli \u00a311.50This was unmemorable. Overall dinner was satisfying though the prices here are a little more on the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 side.On another occasion, I came back during the May long weekend for some dim sum with friends. Usually this wouldn't be my first pick but they were having a promotion for the month of May with 25% off.With a large table, we got down to ordering and they have some new items introduced into the menu. Where do I begin? Having had dim sum here in the past, I always thought it was respectable if not ever a tad expensive for the quality.Let's start with the newcomers.Underwhelmingly disappointing. The fish dumplings were over steamed and dry. The taro cake was slices of taro that were pressed together but doesn't gel as it should like a turnip cake and lacked any taste. The green tea sponge cake? There are no words.Back to the regulars, the quality and standard were inconsistent with some being good and others disappointing. Compared to my previous visits, there is a distinct drop in quality.We finished the dim sum with dessert with one of the party ordering the sago cream with yam and the rest had the sweet dumplings.Desserts itself took over half an hour to arrive and having made these sweet dumplings before, it doesn't take half an hour. When it arrived, I was so disappointed that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The dumpling had a crackling texture instead of being chewy and QQ; the soup did not even have any hint of ginger!Having spent that long waiting for our dessert, it was another 20 minutes for our bill to arrive. With a young child in tow, you bet the little boy was pretty restless by this stage. We finally went to the counter to pay our bill and to our surprise, there was no discount. We queried with the lady who served us and the answer we got was the bill is generated via a machine that is maintained by head office and it seems that head office had excluded the discount from the machine and sales today. Lady, how difficult is it to whip out a calculator and manually write or deduct the discount if your machine is malfunctioning?I don't know about you but when I am greeted by this discount advert sign when walking through canary wharf after the dim sum with no discount, bad service and disappointing food, something is seriously wrong and disappointing here. Misleading advertising is what I will begin with.",

In short: There is often a wait for a table so it's good to arrive at a time other people might not. The food is also slightly higher priced that you might expect and if you add drinks it's going to be a big bill (evening menu). For Dim-Sum it's very high quality with only a small selection of generic dishes. I enjoyed this Restaurant a lot, but they need a few more floor staff for the busier periods. In addition there doesn't appear to be free parking unlike other Chinese restaurants nearby. I really liked their Tofu and Aubergine dishes, very good. Great place to take a date :) They could improve the seating layout a bit and the number of staff, but overall it's a great place.",

    "text": "I hate leaving a one star review, but Royal China dearly deserved it.I wanted to try something in Canary Wharf which wasn't a national restaurant chain, so we settled on Royal China.Right from the off, I could tell something was dubious about this place. It had the pretence of a traditional Chinese restaurant, with none of the charming decor. It all felt off-colour, inside, as though they'd tried to modernise the interior but it just ended up looking a bit dated.Royal China's biggest downfall however, is their service. We hadn't reserved, so were duly told we had to be out within 80 minutes. Not a big deal, sure, but the restaurant was largely empty and we were only a table of two. As it happens, the restaurant did get busier, but there were still plenty of free tables as we left.I'm pretty certain our waitress absolutely hated us. She didn't welcome us, was very abrupt, barely gave us time to look at the menu and didn't crack a single smile all night. And then I noticed all the staff were exactly the same.I decided to try something new, and settled on Eel. My partner decided to go for a chicken noodle dish. Reading the menu, it listed one of the ingredients in my dish as containing MSG, and I politely requested to have my food without it.The waitress honked \"HUH?\" at me twice before swiftly turning away, returning to write something in Mandarin on the table and walking off again. Wow.The food came out after a short wait, and neither dish was particularly appetising. The noodles in the chicken dish were overly greasy and a mixture of crunchy and soggy. The Eel dish left me feeling rather ill afterwards.Bad food, horrific service and an awkward atmosphere.Hilarously, they included their service charge in the bill. Whilst this is standard practice across London's dining establishments, such places also offer.. y'know.. service. On our way out, the staff didn't bother saying bye or wishing us a good evening. I can't recommend you avoid this restaurant enough. Worst restaurant I've ever been to.",

The prices are very dear for Chinese food, but perhaps not for the location. Still, \u00a320 for a plate of fish in cream corn sauce was enough to put me off, as lovely as the picture menu makes out the food to be. Some of the staff extended warm service, particularly those who greeted and welcomed diners at the door. But once seated, the waitress seemed more impatient. For example, when taking our drinks order, we asked which wine we should try, and the waitress bluntly said she didn't know anything about wine. And as we examined the drinks menu, she took off without a word, instead of uttering something nice like \"I'll give you a few minutes,\" as one could expect from a \"posh\" restaurant (come on, \u00a320 for a main dish, that's posh, right?). The food itself tasted good, but portion size is very small and given the price, it's not great value.",

This was demonstrated by the fact that the place wasn't packed on Chinese New Year!",

I had never been before so the other people who had been there before ordered.The chicken dish was particular tasty. Mmmmmm!! Other dishes was sea bass which was a particular large one and very nice. As well as a veg dish we also had a beef dish. Not sure what its called but it was beef in a very hot sandpot which kept the food hot all the way through meal. With the beef were Japanese mushrooms (Enokitake). The beef does was also DELICIOUS!!I have rated this 5/5. If honest its not 5/5 as its not \"perfect\". Nothing is perfect!! The veg dish was very nice but not \"spectacular\" and it was more expensive than a normal Chinese restaurant in somewhere like Chinatown. (Well Chinatown in Manchester anyway!!)The restaurant was by the Thames so sure the view was good but it was too dark to see anything when we went.(Just realised there are 2 instances of this Royal China restaurant. This instance already had 6 reviews so I have added mine here. I have notified Yelp about the other one which only had my review).(Sorry if this has caused any problems!!)",

    "text": "Did you know that the most expensive food ever was an Italian truffle, sold at over $200,000?This restaurant probably puts Italian truffle powder in their food, that's the only explanation for the price.Anyway, we had some trouble finding this place. For some reason Google Maps gave us the wrong directions. For those that need help finding this place, go to the roundabout a Westferry Circus. Then, go towards the river and walk down the stairs. Royal China is next to the outdoor elevator.Service is average. The staff weren't particularly nice, but they weren't mean either. Although, for something this fancy, I'd expect better. Also, while all the waiters and hosts speak Mandarin, the menus have Chinese, and the dishes are authentically Asian, this restaurant felt like a Western establishment. The table set-up and aesthetics are Western-style, and dishes are ordered per person, rather than shared for the group.The food was fairly average. It's decent, but not extra good or special, when compared to a restaurant that costs two times less.For two people, we ordered 2 bowls of seafood soup, 2 bowls of white rice, and split 1 beef dish. That came out to be \u00a327.57. That's 0.014% of the world's most expensive food. Estimating our dinner to be \"worth\" about half the price, I can only imagine that the other \u00a315 in cost came from the 0.1035 grams of Italian truffle they added to our meal.",

    "text": "I've been putting off writing a review but I'm finally getting down to it fresh off the back of a weekend dinner with a party of 7.I booked the table just 4 hours earlier (because I'm not a square...) and there was no problem at all. We were able to be seated immediately after our arrival during peak weekend dinner rush.On my previous visits I'd only dined at lunch and ordered from the dim sum menu. I encourage everyone to come and try it. It's a great experience and much better than the vast majority of places in Central. There will be a line though... so arrive early or arrive late.This time because it was evening and we had so many people I was really able to go crazy with the menu. We ordered Peking duck, soup, so many different types of dishes and even dessert. So here's the skinny:This place gets busy... although booking isn't essential especially on week days, it's a good idea to call ahead even by an hour or two and make a booking anyway. You'll be really glad you did once you see the line going out of the door during meal rush because if there's one thing everyone can agree on about us Chinese folk... it's that we LOVE to eat and will queue for a ridiculous amount of time for a good meal.Although I rate this restaurant highly, I will say that you should steer away from Northern Chinese or Sichuanese dishes here since this restaurant (and its associated restaurants around London) specialises in Canton cuisine. This means yes on dim sums, soups, stir fried greens, seafood and anything that's not spicey but no on anything that resembles Sichuanese cuisine or spicy 'fragrant' dishes (mapo tofu is a good example.) This is not a criticism of the restaurant but rather a reflection of the fact that China is a LARGE country and the food varies vastly between each region so it's unreasonable to expect a Canton restaurant to make really good Sichuanese or Northern style food.Instead, order all the dim sum you can eat because it's excellent here. Cantonese roast duck is a delight. Scallops, steamed fish, soups and stir fried greens (my favourite is gai lan, a kale like vegetable). If you're longing for a taste of Beijing, I'd avoid the Beijing duck here. Although is it passable I would only call it 'Beijing' duck when feeling generous. It is more like a Cantonese roast duck served up 'Beijing' style and at around \u00a350 it's an expensive mistake to make if you are not prepared. Service at Royal China is top notch. I always seem to catch May when she's working and she's always been so kind and attentive. It really makes the experience worthwhile since finding a Chinese/Cantonese restaurant with good food AND good service is almost impossible.An added bonus is that you can hop on the River Bus at Westferry right on their doorstep to Westminster Pier! This goes the other way too of course. :P",

They were full by 12:15, and there was a pretty long queue after that, so worth arriving early or late on Sundays if possible!We shared a number of options, and service was professional and quick although brusque as at other locations. As a vegetarian, I was pleased that there are more veggie options than at some places, particularly as they offer both their full menu as well as a dim sum menu (which only has a couple vegetarian options, really). Between the two, I was able to eat plenty. One point off for not having the crispy vegetarian duck, which is a personal favourite. It's located right at the Westferry Canary Wharf TfL riverboat service, so after you've had your meal, you can walk out to a boat and be back at London Bridge or Embankment way faster than you could on the tube or DLR, plus a great view! We had one small child with the group, and they didn't seem phased by her running around a bit, and there were loads of families with kids, so I would say this is a kid-friendly spot at brunch, at least.",

    "text": "Royal China, Canary Wharf Riverside - we had a simple midweek dim sum lunch. If you are around Canary Wharf for lunch, notice the amount of people lunching outdoors when the sun is shinning. The square, park and along the river side are filled with people. You would think that would be no one dining in the restaurants. Oh yes, they were there too!I always felt that Royal China was somewhat classier. It was probably the colour scheme that gave that impression - gold against the black. Stepping into the restaurant, it was just an average Chinese restaurant. Perhaps with a slight touch of elegance, only a slight. I didn't know why I felt intimidated. Prices of the dim sum dishes were quite reasonable around \u00a33.50 per dish and rice/noodle dishes at \u00a310.00.The menu, like a book, had quite a good selection of dishes and not just an endless list of shifty combinations of meat and sauce. The recommended set menu also looks like a good combination of food if you want to feast on. Royal China is quite a classic Chinese restaurant in England with the usual favourites of aromatic crispy duck, lemon chicken, marinated shiitake mushrooms and Singapore noodles.crispy noodles with chicken \u00a39.50 - the noodles had a good crunch, not undercooked, and the gravy sauce not too strachy or salty. Just the perfect balance with an assortment of crunchy vegetables. roast pork buns \u00a33.50 - quite a meagre filling but I liked the bao. Soft, fluffy and steaming hot. Yummy!turnip cake with cured meat \u00a33.50 - not a good texture. Looked good but failed to deliver in taste and the texture was mushy and felt wrong. fried yam paste meat dumplings \u00a33.50 - my favourite dim sum! The pastry was a little too oily and filling, \u00a0too salty. Not pleasant. honey roast pork puff \u00a33.50 - another must order dish for me at my dim sum outings. Nice!shanghai pork dumplings \u00a33.50 - the pastry was quite thin and the soup in the dumpling was flavoursome. Pretty much average. plain chee cheung fun with peanut sauce \u00a33.80 - I am always glad to try new variety of dim sums offered and I felt quite western when ordering this fusion dish. Well, I can say that I am definitely not ordering this dish again. The chee cheung fun alone also had a very funny texture - mushy, felt as though the proportion of flour was wrong or a substandard rice flour was used. Although I did enjoy the light afternoon dim sum lunch, I thought that the recommended \u00a0service charge of 13% was quite steep. A simple midweek dim sum lunch does not count. Definitely heading for my weekend dim sum lunch for a proper dim sum fix!",

    "text": "While the food was impeccable but and it's a big but...they rushed us from the time we walked in the door. We were repeatedly told that we need to clear out in an hour and a half. The main server kept coming to us every 15 minutes and pointing at her watch reminding us just how log we had to finish our meal. We came here for a team lunch and were 10 of us, which meant finishing our meal in 1.5 hours basically meant ya rushing through our food!!!! Also, when we got around to ordering our desserts, our orders were taken and then a minute later we were blatantly told that since it takes time we couldn't have it. This was absolutely rubbish and it's sad because the food was actually good. But when our celebratory lunch turned into a rushed gobbling up of food even, it became imperative to give a negative review!!!!!!",

    "text": "It was a birthday treat and I had chosen Royal China Canary Wharf out of pure laziness and also due to the fact that the branch at Baker Street require reservations most of the time. While it was good, i can't help but feel that the standards are not up to scratch to the branch at Baker Street. My Chee Chong Fun had a pathetic amount of soy sauce and it was so dry it stuck together. What about the rest of my dim sum..? It was okayish. Oh and my food came lukewarm, not sure why. Sorry Royal China, I love the Baker Street branch but maybe not the one at Canary Wharf and it pains me to leave a bad review for this experience. However above all, the service here is decent. ;)",

The food selections are mostly Cantonese style dishes, including dim sum items. I went here for lunch and ordered mostly dim sum foods. The food is decent, I think the menu selection is a bit limited. Otherwise, I really enjoy the atmosphere there.",

The main plus is the decor which is nice and opulent and they have very plush restrooms. Unfortunately these are not my main criteria for choice of yum cha. Ordered similar dishes to always. The char siu sou had a very stingy char siu to sou ratio. Siu long bao - the skin was very good but the soup and filling were very bland. Gon chau ngou \u00a0hor (beef ho fun) was the best dish we had, I would have liked it to have more soy/seasoning but apparently that's just my gwai lo taste buds. The turnip paste was mushy, bland and just not nice. The veggie cheung fun was horrible - bad consistency of the Cheung fun and just a weird taste and aftertaste. The chicken feet were ok but let's be honest we're talking about chicken feet. The beef balls again were very bland.",
