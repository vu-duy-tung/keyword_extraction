You will go back time and time again for it. I especially like the bilberry tart. It is delicious. It was first introduced to me by a friend and i go back for it whenever I see the shop. They also have a chocolate tart. The chocolate filling is very rich so if you love chocolate go try this. You can sit there and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea while eating your desert.",

It wins hands down as it has a great tea room at the back of the shop which houses plenty of comfortable seats but with the traditional French patisserie atmosphere. You can have anything from the great menu (hot and cold) as well as whatever is on sale in the patisserie. Service is always quick and friendly and you are left alone to enjoy your meal. You ave to try the coffee with cream ;0)",

The inside is really cosy and comfortable and the food was great. they have a nice selection of breakfast options and if you're german and desire to eat proper bread in london I can highly recommend this place. their bread is good and if you're going for breakfast also cheap. they have bread basket option for about \u00a34 which comes with 3 different kinds of bread, butter, and 2 types of paul's marmalade. I am not sure if it's seriously meant for 1 person, but it fed me and my parents - for \u00a34!! and the bread and marmalade was delicious. The only thing to is that their hot chocolate is proper hot chocolate so more like melted chocolate which is not for everyone, but besides that, paul's is amazing for breakfast. I also had a hot panini to go there there was which was delicious with many more \"to go\" options which are perfect for breakfast or lunch.",

You have to be pretty strong willed if you can walk past and not be drawn in by the aroma of fresh coffee and the glorious cakes and tarts displayed in the window. They also sell salads, sandwiches and some hot meals but is the cake I always go for (explains my constant weight problem!). I can personally recommend the carrot cake and my husband loves the chocolate cake! Their coffee is good and I am a very fussy coffee drinker and the hot chocolate tastes how hot chocolate should and not the watered down version that lots of places sell. There are not that many tables inside although the narrow front of the shop does open out to a nicely decorated room at the back. There are also some tables outside which are good for people watching. It can get very crowded and is certainly not cheap but for an occasional treat I would thoroughly recommend this patisserie.

There was not too much or too less of anything. Hubby got the Ham with Emmental which was very good, so he says because I didn't get to taste it. I chased the sandwich with some hot chocolate which was way out of this world. My only complaint is the size...does small really have to mean small esp when it comes to hot chocolate?The restaurant was not too busy when I got there, but that was after lunch. I really liked the ambiance, very Parisian...sans attitude. I will be going back if not for anything, the fantastic cheese sandwich.",

    "text": "In a country bereft of decent bakeries, Paul is definitely a force for good. Its bread is several leagues above what can be obtained from a typical British sandwich shop, bakery or upmarket supermarket. Together with high quality fillings, this bread effortlessly elevates Paul's sandwiches far above those available elsewhere on the high street. The rest of their offerings are pretty solid too, in particular their unusually excellent and rich hot chocolate, made with real chocolate rather than chocolate powder, and their cakes. Most of their staff are French too which adds further to the authentic experience. The cosy Covent Garden branch is where Paul's London adventure started. The front of the shop gears to takeaway customers and is stacked with an array of tempting sandwiches, pastries, quiches, bread and cakes. At the back there is a seating area allowing customers to take some time over their lunch and order from a wider range of food. Service is quick, helpful and friendly.Despite offering some of the best sandwiches on the high street, I think Paul has two weaknesses. The first is cost: sandwiches are priced at the higher end of the market at \u00a34 minimum, pastries around the \u00a32 mark and cakes the \u00a33-\u00a34 mark. The second is its lack of attempts to cater to a more healthy market, with an unashamed embracing of traditionally rich French ingredients such as ham and cheese. Both these shortcomings make my visits to Paul more of an occasional treat than a regular source of sustenance, but nevertheless this is still a dependably excellent bakery.",

I ask you, we won the War of the Third Coalition! \u00a0After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo all of the patisserie Pauls in Paris should have been moved to London and all of the Greggs should have been moved to Paris, that would have taught them a lesson!I love patisserie Paul, I love the understated shop frontages which would not be offensive anywhere, the wonderful cakes and tarts, the quiche, the baguettes, the staff, it is one of the few chains that there are just not enough of. \u00a0Why are there more branches of Pret a Manger and Eat than you can shake a stick at and not a single Paul on Bishopsgate?______________________________________________________Historical Note: Trafalgar Full Time Scores \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ships \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Lost/CapturedHoratio Nelson \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 27 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00Pierre De Villenueve \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a033 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 22",

It may be a little more expensive than your average bakery but the payoff is certainly worth it, with viennoiserie, pastries, cakes and desserts and sandwiches standing heads and shoulders above anything you can get in your local or the supermarket. The bakery was founded in 1889 and now boasts hundreds of shops in Europe and the continent. The main draw for me are the quiches at lunchtime - in particular the salmon quiche - and the all-butter croissants. When I was in Spain we ate a few local croissants (made with pig fat and quite disgusting) until Paul came to the rescue. There's nothing like a French croissant, dunked into your morning coffee.",

So when my wife and our friend were discussing meeting somewhere central for a late breakfast I knew exactly where to take them!The food on my second visit was great. We started with a basket of baked happiness in the form of pastries to share, and I washed mine down with a luxurious hot chocolate that was compelling and rich!We followed the starter with a big breakfast each. Eggs make me chunder, so it was great to be able to swap my eggs for an extra sausage (which was delicious).The service was very good and we all rolled out of there extremely satisfied.

    "text": "It was ok, but that was about it. \u00a0Maybe it's not their fault though. \u00a0Maybe French folks should stick to cooking French food and not get involved in cooking English nosh. \u00a0After all, there were no baked beans. \u00a0You can't have an English brekky without Heinz Baked Beans (although maybe it's French style or something like that). \u00a0That's the way English folk like me are brought up.So maybe next time I'll stick to French grub. \u00a0I did have some of that and it seemed OK. \u00a0The service was fine, the ambience was nice, the location is great, the loo is ok. \u00a0The prices looked to be about average, although some of the items are definitely priced high.After I've gone here again and tried a bit more of the French nosh, then I'll add any further comments to these. \u00a0I honestly think that if you're in the mood for something casual and French, without any pretentious, then this is a fine place to go. \u00a0But, I'd steer clear on any English food on offering. \u00a0Stick to the French food, etc.But kudos to all of those at this restaurant for the effort they made in doing their very best so that we had had a good time. \u00a0I think that they really tried very hard for us. \u00a0A million thanks for that.Well, I've been back a second time, and it's just the same as last time. \u00a0This is not the place to go for English food. \u00a0The pastries looked very nice, but expensive. \u00a0If that's the sort of thing you're looking for, then have at it. \u00a0The hot drinks are OK, and just average value.All in all, if you're in the mood for macaroons, French nosh, and that kind of thing, then this place is probably OK. \u00a0Anything else, don't bother.",

    "text": "I just quickly visited today to buy a box of mini macaroons for my sister-in-law. Everything looks amazing in Paul but it is quite pricey.I've had hot chocolate here before and it's way too rich and bitter for me so I'd suggest getting the small size if you've never tried it before! Macaroons in Paul are one of my sister-in-law's favourite things and as she no longer lives in London I thought it would make a nice Easter present for her. I was shocked at the price...\u00a39.75 for 12 tiny macaroons! I've bought them before for her and I was sure they were cheaper than that. They're packaged nicely with a bow around the box and they're a variety of colours/flavours, plus they're delicious if you like macaroons but I think they're a bit too expensive.",

    "text": "Have always liked Paul as the quality has always been top notch and you know what your getting.Although nothing has changed in the quality department it's hard not to notice the ever increasing prices and what appears to be smaller sized portions for those increased prices :( it's meant less frequent visits.I still remember as a very young child walking down the stairs of our 9th floor apartment in Paris to go to the local boulanger for the bread and if I was lucky a slice of flan natural. Paul is the only place I know that sells it in the UK. For recreating THE taste of my childhood I'd like to say 'Merci'",

Although we got our drinks with no problem, when it came to ordering food, the waitress was less than coherent and seemed spaced out. We ordered the onion soup to start with, but it never came. After 35 minutes of waiting, we decided to get the check and leave. I found this extremely annoying considering the restaurant was not busy. The manager was really apologetic and comped our drinks but the waitress just didn't seem to care - won't be coming back again.",

It was very soft but lacked in any particular flavour, it was seasoned with salt but not much else.... The potatoes were too strongly seasoned with nutmeg, which I thought was rather odd. Leave the nutmeg for the cakes please. The staff were lovely, and the macaroons were nice. Don't expect to leave screaming for an encore.",

    "text": "We stumbled across Paul after walking around Borough Market and was so glad we ducked in here for a quick meal. I've since learned that Paul is a French chain. It's quite surprising actually since I can't help but associate places like Olive Garden, TGI Friday's, Appleby's and Chili's with the label of \"chain restaurants\". At Paul everything displayed looked wonderful and the items we purchased were delicious and tasted to be made from good quality ingredients. Plus everyone at the bakery section were in fact French. In short Paul is NOTHING like any of the restaurants listed above. This particular location has a cafe in the back and I was surprised by how good all of our orders were. Ingredients tasted fresh, taste was definitely there and the price point was not bad at all. Our server was wonderful and sweet and we immediately liked her. To the point where I felt guilty of shorting her of tip when I felt like she was so deserving of one since we Americans are so used to tipping about 20% of the total bill. However there was no \"Tip\" line when we received the printed receipt after our credit card was run through nor did we have cash with us.Amongst all the cafes that offer great French pastries/breads within London proper, Paul might have been one of my favorites.",
