The Brazilian says the feijoada is good and authentic, but not nearly as good as his mother's (what would I know?) In any case, I love this restaurant for the ambience and the memories! Great first date location for any couple :)",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my evening here. First, I think that it helps that this place is tucked away from all the craziness of Camden (it's located in Inverness Street). The decor, all dark wood, is cosy and inviting. It helps that the cocktail list is prolific, and the drinks are well made by experienced bar staff who know their caiprihinas well. (There are 10 different types here - and if you get here at happy hour the cocktails are \u00a33.50.)While the menu is very comprehensive and has lots of traditional Brazilian large dishes such as pork, black bean and seafood stew - I would recommend getting lots of the street food inspired starters. The cheese bread is a must, as are the courgette and calamari fritters.The evening was made even more enjoyable when I went downstairs and discovered a live band playing typically Brazilian samba. The great quality of this place is that it feels authentic, rather than \"Brasil is our theme\". Definitely one of my favourite places in Camden.",

It is a small space (there is a garden as well), loud and bustling with diners and drinker alike. Most of the people are Brazilian, from the clientele to the wait staff and bartenders. During the weekends there is normally something going on in the evenings with different Brazilian DJ's playing on the upstairs area. They do very good Caipirinhas, which is a must to try, as well as other delicious cocktails. During happy hour you can have selected Brazilian Beers or a glass of house wine for \u00a32.0, a choice of classis Caipirinhas or mango Caipirinhas for \u00a33.50.",

I much recomened the Fish Stew which was slow cooked to perfection. Beautiful big pieces of mullet and haddock falling apart in a creamy, well spiced (with lots of ingredients id never heard of) broth. Value for money is something never as important as the food itself, but 2 main courses and drinks for \u00a323... Brilliant. The only thing that lets down this restaurant is the atmosphere. It was quiet and the waiters did not create the best dining experience. Then again i was there in the middle of the day on a Sunday and i have been told by a friend that its a great place to go to in the evening for a drink.",

It was really easy to find, literally 2 mins away from the Camden tube station and right across the street from Camden Market. The happy hour caiprinhas were potent and flavorful and the waitstaff were great. I had the sea bass that came perfectly cooked and my girlfriends had the Feijoda (slow cooked pork) and the picanha na chapa (beef). We also ordered extra rice and black beans, which is more mexican fare but everything was simply delicious. I'd recommend to all of my friends and will definitely be going back there to try the other dishes namely the red meat that Brasil is so well known for.",

There was defiantly like, just not love.Massive choice of caipirinias to behold, my mixed berries were good, and the classic lime was, er, classic? But could have been a bit stronger.We both had stew type meals (but was other stuff on the menu, the table next to us had a tasty looking steak and battered cheesy chicken thing), meat and black beans for him and really tasty mixed seafood for me. Loved the presentation big time. Stew in a big brown flat bowl and little dome of rice, dried onions and mini pot of cassava dust on another plate. So much prettier than your typical presentation of a stew.There was a bit of live music being played, the staff were friendly (think big dreadlocks and Portuguese speaking), the prices are reasonable, but it just didn't make me go wow, yay, amazing!Turns from bar / restaurant into bar/ club late night and at weekends, so maybe that's were all the fun and atmosphere is gonna be?",

    "text": "Inverness street is not far from the station but easy to miss; nothing too interesting going on apart from a collection of stalls selling typical Camden tat. But if you spot the restaurant do come in and order a caipirinha. :)The decor is quite interesting, with some elements of brazilian northern culture. I usually prefer to visit for lunch, as I've heard it can get quite busy by night. I take the table at the back, next to the big window from which light floods in. Apparently they have a large variety of cacha\u00e7a (brazilian spirit) and maybe one day I'll give it a go. For now I usually get hold of a caipirinha to start with; and if you want to have the real experience (not the best caipirinha I've ever tasted but good enough) go for the classic.The \"fruity\" ones are much weaker, maybe tailored for people who like sweet drinks but not particularly enjoy the taste of alcohol.I start with a selection of small plates - petiscos, not \"brazilian tapas\" as the word means something else entirely in brazilian portuguese. They are quite filling and good for share; my faves are the cassava chips (crunchy and salty, yum), pork sausages with onion (they're not quite the same as english sausages and are truly delicious; can be a bit \"fatty\" if you're from the healthy eating weaklings brigade, so have it in mind), the coxinha (yummy chicken pastries in typical brazilian dough) and the salt cod cakes. It's better and cheaper to order three from the \"petiscos deal\" (12-8pm) than the snack platter, in my opinion.For mains I tend to be boring and order the feijoada, as their version is quite acceptable. Not very rich and you won't get a bucket ful like you do in Brazil, but it's enough to fill you up (especially if you had some petiscos) and the beans are quite yummy. They could definitely up their game with the farofa, though, as it is quite basic. If you're a meat lover you're in luck; the picanha is very good and so is the mixed BBQ (churrasco); the side of cassava chips that comes with it being a bonus.I rarely order dessert at restaurants but find it hard to resist the brigadeiro, a brazilian chocolate truffle. I'm not even a chocolate fan, but add tons of condensed milk to *anything* and I'll eat it. :) Brigadeiro is moist and creamy because of this, quite sweet and not bitter at all (again, 80% cocoa chocolate snobs best avoid). It's only small and \u00a32 worth of sweeteness to go with your cafezinho.All in all a great lunch that sets you up for the rest of the day. Not cheap as chips but given London prices I think this place offers very good value. Service is friendly and never disappointed me. Never been in the evenings, but by lunch time it is never too full or too loud, making for a relaxing atmosphere where you can actually listen to the music and have a conversation while you enjoy your food and drinks.",

    "text": "Made In Brasil is one of those places I stumbled upon drunk when looking for more drinks and food, and just happened to really love! The food is good, the atmosphere is friendly and casual and the pricing is reasonable.  Firstly I'll point out that it's a good idea to get there before 8pm as the caipirinhas (of which the flavours are numerous - I highly recommend the chilli raspberry) are only \u00a34.95 (usually around the \u00a37.95 mark). And they are good caipirinhas. They also have a pre-8pm tapas deal (3 tapas for \u00a314.50 or 5 for \u00a324.50). And it's decent sized tapas. I usually go for the same thing when I go to Made In Brasil, as I am a creature of habit - the Picanha Na Chapa. It's a nice cap of rump steak (and I don't usuall go for rump) served on a sizzling plate fajita style with chopped onions and tomato, servied with rice and salad. It's a good meal for \u00a314.55. This time my friends went for the tapas and I had a smidgen of jealousy over the portion sizes and how good it all looked! I'll be trying the vegetable and halloumi skewers on my next visit for sure! I usually get a bread basket, as I like the brown butter.I like the decor in the restaurant, particularly downstairs as it has an outdoorsy feeling conservatory with a mural on the wall. It does get a little chilly but the staff are more than happy to put some heaters on for you!",

Bad sides are that for a Brazilian restaurant I have only being helped by people from other nationalities who didn't speak Portuguese (not that is a turn down but different than other Brazilian bars around) and the food takes quite a bit to come, but totally worth waiting. Music is great and toilets are super clean and the price is reasonable for the meal but not really for the sides and starters.",

There were lots of things I did really like about this place but there were quite a few that let it down for me a bit which is why I've only given 3 stars So the good things - the cocktails were delicious, they have a lot of really interesting flavours including kiwi which was divine! They're also only a fiver before 8pm. The tapas deal is \u00a314.50 for 3 dishes before 8pm and the sausage was particularly delicious. The desserts were also really really tasty my friends got the brownie and the guava cheesecake and I obviously had a bite of both. Also recommend the lime mayo.And sadly on to the bad. I was disappointed with the chicken as the way it was served I was definitely not expecting bones and there were a lot. We were sat in the basement which was actually really chilly. The waiter bless him did put on a heater when I asked but it didn't do much to help sadly. The food also took quite a while to come which wasn't an issue as such as we had time but I was ravenous and getting serious food envy of the table next to us! I would like to try them again as some of the other food options did look great as well!",

We ordered pao de queijo to start, cheesy dough balls which I have previously made myself at home. Undoubtedly tasty, but the \u00a34 price tag for six small balls was a little steep when I know I can make about 100 of said balls for the same price!!For main course we went for the sharing platter of picanha aperativo - rump steak with cassava chips, fried onions and salad garnish. The received the thumbs up from the native Brazilian, high praise indeed. He felt the flavours were spot on, only the quality of the cut could be improved in the restaurants back home. If this is a good example of Brazilian food, I can't wait to get out there and try it for myself, although I will come back about three stone heavier!The space was attractive and comfortable, with further seating space available downstairs. The staff were friendly and helpful, and not overbearing. Overall, a brilliant place to escape the craziness that is Camden.",

I called in at about 9 o'clock mid week and managed to get the only table that was left and proceeded to check out the menu.There was a pretty decent selection of meat, fish and veggie and I decided to plump for the Moqueca. This is mixed seafood and fish stew made with sweet peppers and coconut milk served with steamed rice & farofa (grated cassava crumbs) and really good value at only \u00a312. The bowl was packed with king prawns, mussels, clams, calamari and some white fish and the broth was fantastic. In fact it was so nice that I ended ordering a bread basket just to eat more of it!I also tried a little bit of the Bobo de camarao which was tiger prawns in a creamy sauce. That was ok but not in the same league as the first dish. There was a fairly general selection of beers including Brahma and Sagres.This place deserves another visit and this time I'll venture onto the meat side of the menu",

Though it wasn't traditional, it certainly was an amazing experience.- Beautiful music serenaded us, live, from near the entrance, as we feasted on Brazilian tapas.- Rich flavors are the modus operandi for Made in Brasil, as everything we ordered left us wanting more.- Awesome caprinhas were just the start of the night, and though they aren't tequila, they were definitely interesting.- Service was great, attentive and quick to take care of us. It's a small restaurant, but they quickly seated us too.- Interesting ambiance, definitely inspired by Brazil, which is really a country you don't get enough exposure to the culture of.- Lots of tequila options. Nuff' said.In general, it was a good change of pace from our typical Mexican theme, had great food, and left us wanting another visit. Their prices are a little bit on the high side, but I don't spend a lot of time in Camden, so maybe this is more typical of the area.",

I kinda wanted to eat everything, so I totally did. You can order 5 little dishes for $20, and it's really great value. They also have happy hour during the week on caipirinhas and beers.

As a Brazilian living in the Uk for one year now I DO miss my food. So it was really nice to \u00a0try the restaurant's Tapas deal, that you can choose to 3 of some very well known snacks (such as Coxinhas, P\u00e3o de Queijo or Pastel) for a very good price. The service is another positive factor. From the started to the main course you have a very pleasant staff around always checking if everything is okay or if we need something else. As Camden Town is known for being a place for all tastes, Made in Brasil wouldn't be in another place. The Caipirinhas are very nice and the prices are another positive point. For a London restaurant Made in Brasil is affordable for all kinds of pockets, Definitely a place to be back soon!",
