I also got a tea to go, and boy was it hot. \u00a0It took awhile for it too cool down even after I got back to the hotel. \u00a0It was a fantastic tea. \u00a0It is not loose leaf, it is a bagged tea that they sell there. I can't remember the name of the brand they sell. I wish I did, because it was REALLY good. \u00a0I am definitely going to be returning to try some of their other tasty looking selections! \u00a0It is also nice that the staff was friendly.",

And I'm not much of a cake person... ok, that's a lie, but still even after stuffing my face with cake for most of my life, this still wins the top prize.I ate one of their mini quiches as well, which was lovely... but did I mention how nice the chocolate cake was?",

So why am I not singing Euphorium Bakery's praises. \u00a0Well...! I decided to order the ham pizza slice, warmed and to go. At \u00a32.60 a slice it is pretty reasonable, not great but reasonable. Once the pizza announced its readiness to be devoured by me it was removed from the oven and placed in a bag. A bag? Pizza - in - a - bag?I left the posh bakery ready to eat. Gleefully I reached into the bag to extract my handful of goodness and pulled it out. \u00a0I had to watch in despair as all my topping slid off the pizza onto the pavement. '#@.. *$$!' Several expletives later I resigned myself to eating the warm flat bread with tomato residue and two cold chunks of onion that remained. The pizza episode obviously tainted my experience but I won't let that cloud my judgement. I will certainly go back and stay for lunch as it does have a nice relaxed vibe. The cakes look great and rather than go for the pizza again, I will play it safe and enjoy a nice sweet pastry.",

The bread is quite expensive, but also worth the price tag. A good tip to know is that they sell all their specialty bread for half price after eight every evening, to make room for a fresh batch the next day. The counter has a large selection of pies, quiches, pizza slices, cakes and tarts on display. There is also a lovely courtyard in the back, which fills up quickly in sunny weather. The staff are really friendly, and people come from far and wide to sample the bread made here (the muesli bread is quite yummy with soup). Jamie Oliver is said to shop here as well.",

The best thing about this place is the sitting outside, 'watching the world go by seeing who's who flitting up and down Upper Street. Much as there is no getting away from the classy presentation of the food, there is really something very meh about this place. I had the beef and watercress sandwich. The beef was very tough and cut really thick it nearly ripped my teeth out. I have eaten other things here before like pastries or cakes and although they look fantastic , on eating they miss the mark. Also slightly alarmed to see them only get 1* for Food Hygiene inspection, which is really not great at all. Its also fairly expensive in my view hitting around \u00a37.00 for a small sandwich and coffee.There are many places to eat on Upper street, I doubt Ill visit again unless I need to sit outside, then it will be coffee only and food elsewhere.",

Typically Islington in an elegant, faux-European kind of way, Euphorium has a wonderful selection of pastries and cakes and serves good, if not extraordinary, coffee.I particularly like the courtyard area at the back of the cafe which can become busy but is lovely during the summer. A great way to avoid the hustle and bustle of Upper Street in a charming cafe with even more charming staff. Highly recommended.",

Hence, I felt I could not possibly walk by it without trying something. The selection of breads is not bad, and tends towards the Mediterranean. I only tried one item of confectionary - the chocolate tart - and man, was it delicious. It was just rich enough and had a sprinkling of cocoa powder on top, which caused me to cough once I took my first bite. Service was good, the atmosphere was cosy and to top things off, there are samples of the different items on offer so that you can try before you buy. Prices are about what you would expect to pay in any bakery in central London.",

    "text": "Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination. At least that's what the napkin I got from here says. The outside of this shop is rather uninspiring. Once you are inside though, it's time for your mouth to start watering. In fact I have only the vaguest impression of the seating areas: polished metal chairs, quite airy, low music, quite full even mid afternoon on a very glum day. What caught my attentions was the service counter. A range of 'artisan' breads fill the end by the door. Further in you get plain slices of cake, then fancy cakes (including some chocolate creations, complete with chocolate flowers, that look quite incredible), and then savouries. Along the way there are individual cheesecakes and tarts with juicy fruit gleaming on the top, and slices of pizza loaded with rich looking ingredients. In the end I went for a take out of one of the cheapest options: a blueberry clafouti. It reminded me of bread pudding, but apparently (I've just looked up a recipe), it's not anyway it was gorgeous. Solid and moist without being soggy, not too sweet, the fruit layer sharp, the dusting of icing sugar adding a hint of texture like footsteps in fresh powder snow. Prices are not cheap, with many small cakes and savouries being \u00a33 or more. But actually for the quality on show here that seems like a bargain. Service was another thing I was too distracted to really notice but no problems so I think it was good! Great place for a coffee date to impress or a treat for yourself.",

But rarely is it these that stop me, gets me in the door and my fist firmly thrust into my pocket, searching around for change. No, it's the breads that tickle my fancy, most especially (and in order of preference) the scandinavian- linseed, pumpkin and seasame bread so good toasted with a little butter- it's been nicknamed popcorn bread by my girlfriend because it smells like popcorn when toasted. Then there is the rye bread- made from 100% rye flour, gooey, delicious, rich, cakey bread, best in my opinion toasted with some goats cheese and smoked salmon, lemon juice and pepper on top (do I have you salivating?). Last but not least, the walnut bread in my opinion best eaten in it's virgin state, fresh, light and soft with anything involving avocado and fresh prawns don't forget the lemon juice and pepper with this either. So you see, I love Euphorium breads. They get me excited. The sausage rolls are amazing too as are the salmon and spinach brioches. And the cafe is pretty nice to sit down in aswell so long as you don't mind sharing it with 20 pushchairs. This isn't just any bakery. It my bakery.",

Third: they seem to hate people who want to use their caf\u00e9 as a mobile office; they don't provide outlets - or - they don't allow you to use the existing outlet. I get it, you don't want people to occupy your tables for hours without consuming anything, but there's ways to compromise, aren't there? Don't they get that us mobile workers are the future?!However, there is still one thing about Euphorium bakeries that is worth pointing out and which is the reason why I still come here: their bread. In fact, their Scandinavian bread as well as their 100% rye bread are the best bread I've come across in London so far...only these days I don't combine my visit with a cup of coffee anymore as I neither feel welcome nor comfortable here.",

I recently came here for a coffee to perk up after a long walk and just couldn't resist a slice of lemon cake temptingly displayed on the counter. Unfortunately the latter was a bit dry, hence the four stars. The coffee was excellent, though, as was the tomato and herb focaccia I bought to take home.Wish we had a branch in Notting Hill as everything looked delicious and deliciously different from some of the more generic bakeries.",

    "text": "Was at the HSBC in Islington today--asked the banker if there was a good place around to get a nice croissant. She said go to Euphorium, but to make sure you only bring cash. Because otherwise you'll want to buy everything you see. I noticed the food items in the glass cases are arranged in a specific progression... the first case you see at the entrance is practical and savoury (sandwiches, pizzas, quiches) then when you get towards the cash register it is downright dirty and sinful. They were giving out free samples of blueberry clafoutis, which I can only describe as these baked custardy fruit things. I am not going to lie. I totally snuck my little hand in the basket for an second sample.In the end the boyfriend got a mushroom egg savoury brioche and I got an almond croissant. We ate at the park across the street and the almond croissant was one of the messiest things I've eaten in awhile. Powdered sugar and crumbs everywhere, and as you can imagine the pigeons were just as happy as we were.",

Today I asked 3 staff members (10 minutes between each) to finally get my order! The coffee by that time was cold.No one apologized as if they are doing you a favor. Had exact same problem several times in the past.Otherwise, the coffee is good (but not in the league of coffee works or other good coffee places). The baked goods are excellent when fresh. The decor is really nice and warm.Could easily be a 4* place but really the extremely poor service and rude staff disqualifies it.During the week, when it's not busy, the staff are polite and helpful.",

Anyway, I knew I needed an attitude adjustment: it was just after 5am and I'd hate to suffer the next 15 hours before I get another chance at a day. \u00a0Coffee. Carbs. Immediately. \u00a0(What? Me? Emotional Eater?) It didn't start off well.-First, they don't open until 7:30am. I was willing to wait... I figured a \"first to review\" would be a nice treat to myself. (nevermind the loaf of bread I was bound to consume...) -I popped by again an hour and a half later, and this time I wasn't willing to wait any longer. I certainly wasn't willing for them to clearly ignore me in front of the register. I nearly walked out, but my desire was deep. -My coffee was only \u00a31.90 which was grand, but giving them a \u00a320 and then getting 18 one-pound coins as change? NOT OK. I walked out cursing the world, and the birds, and the rubbish men, and the... wait.. what's this? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A-friggin-mazing latte. Smooth and strong with just the right amount of punch and without any trace of bitterness.
