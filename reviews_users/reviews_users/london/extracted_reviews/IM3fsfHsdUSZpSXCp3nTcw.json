While my burger was quite good I don't think Hache's burgers are in the same class as other gourmet burgers. My beef was juicy and cooked medium as I ordered, however the bun was a bit over-toasted. The burger needed some liberal pours of ketchup and mustard to make up for the bun and to give it that salt/acid profile to make my mouth water.",

    "text": "I'm back! Back from the cultural wasteland of [country not to be disclosed, too many friends there...]! Back to great restaurants and more choice than one person should be allowed to have!!First review: Hache. I was actually waiting for Maggies to open as I'd rather embarrassingly lost my phone there on New Year's Eve. I know... at my age... Maggies... shame on me... Still, they played Huey Lewis, so the place rocks!Stopped by Hache for a quick bite while I waited and wasn't at all dissappointed. The ambience and decor is very inviting and warm. It makes you want to sit at the bar by the window, have a few beers and a very, very decent burger, and watch the Fulham Road girls pass you by.They were fresh out of the Venison burger with Reblechon, unfortunately, as that would have a been a great litmus test, but the steak burger with Reblechon was a very suitable alternative. I'm not a huge fan of sweet substances with my savory food (there's a time and place, and they are rarely together in a main meal, in my humble opinion), so I could have done with less of the homemade Red Onion Chutney, but the burger itself was delicious with the crunchy chicory and lovely melted smelly cheese. It had a really good flame grilled taste and very juicy.I'd definitely go back to work my way through the menu.Oh, alas no phone.... but at least I got a good burger, a few beers, and a lovely view to satisfy an otherwise dissapointing night!",

    "text": "Hach\u00e9 (which means chopped/minced/ground in French) is a burger shop. A fancy gourmet place yes, but a burger shop nonetheless. The layout and atmosphere is quite refined and very visually appealing (and so are the staff!) and fairly comfortable to settle into. The cocktail menu is startling brief with maybe 5 named cocktails and no listed beer options. Really? I'm having a burger so a pint would have suited perfectly but it was not to be. Listen up Hach\u00e9, if you want me to take you seriously get some more options in there stat!The menu is pretty straightforward. You have a pretty impressive selection of steak burgers with choices ranging from the Mexican (jalapenos, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream) to the Catalan (chorizo and chilli jam) to the standard cheeseburger (and a couple with different more unusual cheeses I couldn't spell if my life depended on int). There are also a couple of lamb burgers, a handful of chicken and veggie ones, and a duck burger (which they were sadly all out of that night).I had the Mexican and while the presentation was brilliant with the various components arriving in a divided side dish so you could add to your taste the ingredients themselves left a lot to be desired. First, the burger was more medium well than the ordered medium rare which left the patty a bit dry and tasteless. The guacamole and salsa were decent but fairly mild. I like a spicy salsa and a rich creamy guac but there seemed more out of a jar than freshly made and had lost some of their flavour. The jalapenos were terrible and definitely from a can as there was no heat and a bit of that waterlogged texture you get when peppers have been soaking in something for too long. Finally, the ciabatta bread was so dry it crumbled in my hands as I tried to eat the burger which was an epic fail.I did finish it but likely more from pure hunger than any food ecstasy. To be honest, I was disappointed in it as I'd heard great things from trusted sources. Maybe it was just a bad day, as my fellow diners were similarly unimpressed. The brioche option was a bit better but also on the dry side so overall 1 star for the buns.The redeeming factor (other than the gorgeous red head I wanted to marry on the spot) were the sides. Being all stubborn people who refused to compromise of which sides to get, we pretty much ordered them all. The regular fries were crunchy on the outside and fluffy inside and disappeared in no time. The sweet potato fries were even better with a rich sweetness that was highly addictive. The potato wedges were crispy and came with an incredible garlic mayo dip that I almost wanted to eat plain. The grilled haloumi worked well although was oddly garnished with a couple of slices of red chilli and the coleslaw was surprisingly tasty with a focus on the veggies and not the mayo. The onion rings were good but slightly less so than the rest due to the hoppy beer taste in the batter which was just a bit too much.Overall, Hach\u00e9 is a decent burger joint but nothing to get too excited about purely on the burgers alone. However, when you add in the atmosphere and the sides, it's definitely above average. I'll keep it in mind as I continue my burger quest around town!Note: Make reservations as even early on in the week it gets busy. However, call as their online system will make your reservation but will not prompt them to call you to confirm.",

The food options and made fresh burgers \"in house\" still noticeably nice! But for an otherwise fairly quiet Sat evening and only about 4 tables, the feeling of \"hurry up/I'm stressed out\" service vibe by our beautiful Eastern European waitstaff, left me feeling too much like I feel on a fully booked 777 as the flight attendant that I am! \u00a0Still, great food, just don't understand the service vibe when it's not packed at all. I can totally relate when your work space is packed! Just wasn't the case.",

    "text": "My memories of previous (pre-Yelping) visits to Hach\u00e9 were quite let down by my visit today.I went in for a late lunch - around 3pm. There was only one other person in the place so the waiter told me to sit anywhere. One of my pet peeves, this. Surely the waiter knows the best places to sit, that are convenient for them and comfortable for me. The table I chose must have been close to the kitchen, as it was quite noisy.I have always remembered that Hach\u00e9 is my favourite burger chain burger in London. I'm not often by one so when I was today, I was really looking forward to it. I like that you get to choose a your bun, and I ordered a cheeseburger on brioche with no rocket, chips, garlic mayo, and a Coke.My food came quickly but without the garlic mayo, which I asked for again. He said I didn't order it... Now considering I was one of the only people in the place, that doesn't bode well for a busy day! He called back to the kitchen and asked for it, went and put it through the till, and then proceeded to sit and talk to the other member of staff who came in to talk about his schedule with the manager. Loudly. This other member of staff was American, in a bright blue suit, carrying a bag from Diptyque (what waiter can afford Diptyque?!) and had to have his shifts changed because his mom twisted her ankle coming off the bus and he had to help her 'pack boxes and move shit'. Oh, you mean you don't want to read this in my review? Oddly enough, I didn't want to hear about it while I waited for my garlic mayo, either. By the time I got it, I was half way done with my food.And the food... The burger had a couple of bits of grizzle, but otherwise was tasty. The chips were nice. The garlic mayo wasn't very punchy, but it was okay. I'm not a fan of brioche for burger buns, but it's not too sweet here and works, in my opinion.With the service charge, it was \u00a317.50, so really, too expensive for what was only okay. I left disappointed with my memories tarnished. Sob!",

I had a burger there awhile ago that I really liked and was saddened to see that it was gone last time I came here. So I instead had the ceasar salad with avocado... well thats what I ordered at least, they forgot the avo. Oh well, they saved me \u00a32. My salad with chicken was super good. Really nice. The burger my partner had wasn't great for him but I thought it was pretty good. But personally, I prefer other burger joints than here. But its solid. The cocktail menu is diverse, and the decor is nice and the prices reflect that.",

Since I require a gluten free diet, I find Hach\u00e9 accommodating without compromising taste. From the perspective of American connotations, it almost seems wrong to classify this as a \"burger\" place. It simply does not do justice to the quality of meat and unique taste that you get here.Please feel free to open a Hach\u00e9 in Cincinnati :)",

I actually didn't think very much of the Louisiana burger; while it was decently flavored I think the peanut butter took away rather than contributed to the overall taste. Still, it's a must order for those who are curious.I found the Mexican burger to be much more satisfying, and excellently presented with the guacamole, salsa and sour cream set individually in a tri-dish for self-ladling as needed. It was a spicy monster, and a great choice for the heat-inclined.",

They are so pretty!Burger was good, well cooked and the option I got came with reblochon cheese which was quite unusual and the red onion chutney had some kind of peppercorn in it giving it a great crunch and flavour.Sides are good although oddly proportioned - wedges are huge and fries are much smaller. Wedges came with a bit of garlic mayo and some kind of tomato sauce - they should just leave the latter out, the mayo is much better. Sweet potato fries were good too - everywhere should do these. Onion rings seemed fine but, as the length of this paragraph devoted to sides implies, I kind of ordered too many sides, so I couldn't manage that many onion rings.Service was unobtrusive yet pleasant and efficient, especially considering we were quite a large group.Only thing that was a bit disappointing was the strawberry milkshake. My quest for a good quality milkshake continues...",

Blondes or brunettes (don't recall any redheads), no matter your preference, you're bound to find some eye candy. This was a welcome sight, as I had just wandered the streets on a desolate Monday evening. I needed food before I became feverish. It was a good thing that I came in: I was nearly the only customer.Besides being empty and staffed with attractive women, I noticed that Hache was sterile in appearance. It was quite pretty but... cold. It wasn't that huge of a deal (considering I was pretty hungry) but it made it for an odd atmosphere as i waited for my grub. And, what to eat? Well, at an upscale burger & fries joint, I suppose one orders a burger and fries. I started the meal with a shake. I know London's more expensive than Miami but for almost 4 pounds, I expected more than the slightly runny strawberry concoction I received. Oh well. Time for the main event, eh? The chicken 'burger' was a flattened chicken breast served with an abundance of honey mustard sauce that was more mayo than mustard. It overpowered the cheese and bacon. Si. Es verdad. The sauce overpowered the bacon. *sad trombone* At least the fries lived up to the hype of reviews and pictures. As a warm respite on a cold late-winter's night, Hache is A-OK... but I have no need to rush back. My American expectations were a bit let down.",
