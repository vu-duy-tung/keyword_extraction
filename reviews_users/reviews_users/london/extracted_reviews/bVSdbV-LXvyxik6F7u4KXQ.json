Serving a wide range of beers and ciders, and with a reasonable mix of music, the pub is a popular place for Friday or Saturday night drinks. The outside area has seating in the summer, but with a view of either the spectacularly ugly Holiday Inn or the slightly less unattractive Brunswick Centre, it would have to be a particularly hot day to tempt me outside.",

It's bright, clean and spacious, with high ceilings, wooden floors, chandeliers and homely furniture, including some comfy sofas. It makes for a homely feel - indeed, the tiles around the bar are almost exactly like the tiles in my own hallway! They have a great selection of beers, too - mostly Belgian (including two varieties of fruit beer!), but that is not to say they have neglected the ales; they only have a few, but good ones, not too common, like Spitfire. Maybe it's not the greatest pub ever, but it's refreshingly different. And I'm a sucker for that fruit beer.",

I rang to book more than a month in advance. The first guy I spoke to mumbled (English wasn't his first language), seemed very disinterested, and tried to discourage me. Unwillingly, he then decided to pass me onto someone else (again, English wasn't their first language), who had difficulty understanding me \u00a0but who was utterly disinterested. After mumbling (aka trying to make stuff up), trying to get out of it \u00a0he decided to tell me that they don't take bookings after 5.30pm. I'm sorry, what? After clarifying that I was trying to book over a month in advance, for a large group (guaranteed at least \u00a3400) ie not for tonight, and it was good business \u00a0he confirmed he understood me, and after more vapid mumbling - went on to say in a completely nonchalant drawl that they get busy on Thursdays, and the place gets full. It seemed actually he wanted to say: I/we can't be arsed; but instead, was making up excuses as he went. Wow. I've lived in London for fifteen years, and have never experienced that; good luck to the business that turns away a guaranteed booking of at least \u00a3400, over passing trade. In case anyone is in any doubt, let me make clear that they have a whole section on their website devoted to Christmas bookings, inviting you to book. Good riddance!",

He looks like Michael Winner after a particularly bad spray tan. But enough of that. THe interior decor is similarly odd, looks like someone has had the sandpaper out, though it is nice and spacious with plenty of light but that's no the important part of this pub. It's all about the very interesting range of Continental beers they have on sale, some are more palatable than others, most a bit too fruity for my tastes but there are a few gems. There is also a little designated area for serving coffees, which is a nice touch i think, a better alternative than sitting in a starbucks I reckon. Not the greatest pub in the world but it has character, I like it.",

To make matters worse, even though we all CLEARLY spoke English and conducted ourselves in a very civilized manner, the hostess literally mocked us to our face by speaking really slowly, over-pronouncing words, and using hand gestures to communicate the restaurant's inability to serve us, eventually just saying \"we. have. soup\" and shooing us away.

Now every time we're at Birkbeck or near Russell Square we stop in either for lunch and/or a drink. The furniture is a mish-mash of comfy chairs and sofas, benches and high stools and there are more private areas at the back of the bar, although we like to sit by the big windows near the bar. They have a good menu, everyone's always happy with the food which says a lot considering we all have different tastes! They have a good range of beers, wines and soft drinks, great for a quick drink or a leisurely afternoon. The only problem we've had is with a barmaid who didn't speak English and didn't seem to understand what we were trying to order which was a little frustrating I ordered a lime and soda and ended up with a lager and lime!",

But it wasn't the best choice to arrive on Christmas day when London is a ghost town and the only people out are the tourist zombies. MoC was open on Christmas day but unfortunately we didn't discover it until Boxing Day. I could've had every meal here. We had the lunch prix fixe with fried white baitfish (amazing) and 6 oz steak frites, a bargain at about 12\u00a3. Also had the chorizo and pork burger. Coming from California, I appreciated the quality food that wasn't bland, boring, or greasy. We came back later that night for the sticky toffee pudding. I asked about breakfast since I really wanted to return the next day for my last meal but that's only served on Saturday. The beer selection is great. Again, it's OPEN ON CHRISTMAS. We walked for hours trying to find decent food in the city and ended up with overpriced Indian and random fried chicken. We walked to a few places that the food blogs said would be open but weren't. So disappointed we didn't have Christmas dinner here especially since it was so close to our hotel.",

Being in proximity to the LSE, SOAS, and Central St. Martins means there is something for my friends that have preferences for econ-nerds, internationals, to artsy hipsters. The average age is pretty low, though depending on the night means there are plenty of suits around as well. So there is even something for the more \"business\" inclined women. If you're a good wing-woman, you should keep this place marked. ;-)",

Both floors have a bar which is fully stocked with a good selection of beers.The crowd is mixed in terms of ages with many students as well as tourists and local workers. The staff are efficient and pleasant enough.

After some research on my handy Yelp app I found the Marquis Cornwallis, which also happened to be two short blocks away from the Royal National where I was staying. I meandered over and found an upbeat English pub full of young people enjoying a drink after work. It was exactly what I was looking for and I was lucky enough to grab a table in the crowded bar. I was surprised to see they had my favorite beer, Blue Moon, but made myself try an English beer I'd never had before. I was not disappointed and enjoyed my beer while taking in the atmosphere. I also had dinner and went with their macaroni and cheese and the chorizo plate. Both were delicious and I ended up adding the chorizo to the macaroni and cheese (they should make this a menu item!). Two beers and an awesome meal later I left the Marquis Cornwallis sated and having experienced the English pub I was hoping for. Try it out!",

    "text": "This place is easily 4 stars on a normal night, but on this occasion everything worked against it's favour and only 3 was possible. I'll explain.The Place is split over 2 floors. At 7pm, downstairs was bustling with life. Plenty of patrons there for after work drinks. Luckily we had a reservation for the dining floor upstairs which had a much more ambient setting with lower noise levels. The way it works here is no table service. You need to order drinks and food at the bar and it will be brought to your table, or in the case of drinks, be collected at the bar. It's like Wetherspoons, but whilst Wetherspoons are a tightly run ship, Marquis here began it's descent.We ordered drinks and the card reader was having an off night because it was declined from some machines, then the backup seemed to lose wireless connectivity, making what should take 1 minute, take about 3-4. To save time, we opened a tab and was told drinks would be brought to us. 15 minutes later no drinks. I had to go back to the bar and request them again. Next I went up to order food. Suddenly a memo appeared at that exact moment from the dumb waiter. No more burgers for the night. No explanation why. Just no. So went back to table, got everyone's revised orders and went to order. 30 mins or so later we were eating. Phew.The food itself was very very good. The southern fried chicken is standout. Buttermilk fried, tasty delicious. I could have had it to myself. The pork belly was exceptionally good too. Tender, moist. Everything was great down to the sticky toffee pudding..mmm. Which made the disparity with the service that little bit more annoying. There was one barmaid serving the whole first floor. That's both drinks and food and billing. Way too much for one person and it showed. I can't really attribute blame to them, particularly as they appeared to be doing their best and was super apologetic. Table service, even just one extra staff member would really help in the food area. Now I had no problem with having to go up to the bar. But if that process isn't working, table service is the best alternative until it's fixed.In all honesty, I want to give this place a 4 and without all the troubles it easily is. It's a nice place to impress in a relaxed environment with top notch food. It's just that 4 stars says \"there's really not much to improve\" and that is far from the case on the service side.",

    "text": "The pub itself is nice. Decent space, room between tables, room at the bar, etc. I went yesterday for a roast with some friends, and it just wasn't very good, though. We ordered at the bar as you do, one after the other, with my partner and I ordering second out of six orders. A few people ordered the pork roast and it came without crackling - though the menu indicated it came with it. A quick question and, not 5 minutes later, they had crackling on the table. After about 10 minutes, my partner and I questioned where our food was and we were told it was on it's way. Then we were told it was just going to be a few minutes. About 25-30 minutes after everyone had ordered - and some plates had been cleared! - our meal arrived. At least it was hot, right? Except my partner's \"beef roast, no gravy\" was covered in gravy, absolutely bathing in it, and my chicken roast was dry and just not cooked very well. It also only came with two small pieces of carrots, what? And the potatoes just tasted... off. When we mentioned to the manager on duty that our food was served so long after everyone else's, we were told it was because we had ordered last and the kitchen does tickets in the order they're received. Fine, except we ordered before everyone except one person. So, no, that's not an excuse. When we clarified that, the manager kind of shrugged and apologised. He ended up comping our meal which we didn't know until we went up to close the tab, which was a very nice gesture - but the whole experience just left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, the place was only about 2/3 full, so it shouldn't have been too bad in the kitchen, especially considering a lot of people didn't seem to be eating.",

I can't say how much of the menu I've eaten (80-90%), but the food's always been incredible and the staff have always been amazing. They're always really friendly and up for a laugh, and if you go in enough they really get to know you. It's one of those places that you can sit in all day if you want. If you do want to eat in the evening, then it's always better to go upstairs past 6pm as the bottom half get's very busy most days of the week. But the local crowd are well-natured and there's always a good vibe.If I was to make any negative comment, it's that it can be pricey in terms of drinks (\u00a35.60 for a G&T in a tumbler, not a long glass). But no more than most other places I suppose.",

There wasn't any turnip or cabbage and minimal carrots and peas. \u00a0Roast potatoes were soggy - all in all it wasn't impressive.We came with a group of 10+ and appreciate not everyone would get their selection for roasts as it was late in the day, however, almost everything on their menu was not available except for burgers! \u00a0So it was either Chicken (they only had 4 left) or burgers. Not the nicest pub experience.Looking at the other reviews, it appears the people who are new to London rate this pub highly, however, the people who know about London pub food rate this low. \u00a0I wouldn't bother going here again, there are so many more options!",

    "text": "Honestly in a city ravaged by chain pubs, the Marquis of Cornwallis offers a very high class environment while seemingly avoiding the chain-tag. Though I am never surprised to find out something is a chain, this doesn't appear to be one.This pub doesn't have the greatest prices in this century, but is a good place to grab one pint. Food prices hover around the 10+ pound range so again, this isn't a cheap place, but is is quite nice! Coming in here for a pint or two is all I'd recommend if you are on a budget.The seating is extremely comfortable and the pub is very spacious, including a second level. It has a wholesome feel and is very very clean. Staff is semi-eager to usher you out after you've finished your pint, but they won't do anything about it if you sit around talking.The selection of beers on tap is another plus; there are several microbrews and the standard mainstream beers. It's worth trying something new at this place, the local taps are tasty as hell!! (is hell tasty?)Overall, this place is a grand slam (baseball reference). A true touchdown (american football reference) of the sphere of pubs in London. Honestly, it's a slam dunk (basketball reference). Hole in one (golf).",

The guys are a fun bunch both downstairs and upstairs, always good for a chat and quick laugh and knowledgeable of all the menu and drinks. I think I have been enough times to have had all what's on the menu and it's all really really good. Love the burger and risotto the most, but you can't go wrong ordering anything on here. Great for group events as well. I've seen many spots reserved for office parties, and early hen dos and such. With it right next to the Russell Sq station and Kings Cross, it's a pretty good location as well. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, they have sticky toffee pudding. Really that by itself deserves a star, am I right? *self five*",

I was a bit late, entered in a hurry and bumped into a party of men in tuxedos with bow ties and goblets of brandy. Wow, I felt underdressed! Thankfully that wasn't a dress code I happened to miss and I quickly fell in the arms of my more normally dressed friends to drink the night away.Nice gastropub style here, really good amount of space and didn't feel too crowded even though the atmosphere was good. We eventually took over the top floor with our party of people which always helps! Drinks at about \u00a34 a pint is pretty expected in Fitzrovia, a bonus given that oyu expected to pay more given the decor of the place.Didn't have any food but it looked like good quality gastropub menus (I always approve of a pub with a snack menu when it includes a scotch egg!)Kicked us out at midnight, can't moan about that on a weekday!",

    "text": "Everything about this place was a bad experience. Walked in, didn't see a host/ess (not sure if that's a usual thing in London or not, but I've been greeted in other establishments here so I wasn't sure), so I asked someone and they rudely told me just to pick a seat and order at the bar. I picked a seat, draped my shirt over the chair, and went to order at the bar. I was informed by the bar that you need to know your table number, there's no indication as such (even a couple Londoners didn't know) and it turns out it's a tiny little medallion on the table. Not exactly conspicuous or clear as to what it means. So I go back to my table and I see that my jacket it missing. I start asking the couple next to my table and they didn't see anyone grab it, so I was a little worried someone took it. The individual from earlier informed me a group had sat down so he took the jacket, I said my jacket was there before the group, and he angrily corrected me saying he thought the group had left before I got there and maybe someone left the jacket so he took it away. Another couple had claimed those seats by then, so I lost my seat (but thankfully got my jacket back). Went up to the bar and ordered something, was informed it's no longer available, so ordered something else, same story, so he offered a substitution. During all of this he asked me to hurry up with the order about 5 or 6 times as \"the kitchens closing in three minutes!\" (complete with hand gesture). Because of that I didn't get a good chance to read over the menu, and ordered hastily. My food comes and it's completely not what I expected. The original guy sees me look at it disappointed and asks if that's what I ordered. \u00a0I explained to him what happened and he just said \"sorry!\" and walked away. Everything here was unclear, the staff was incredibly rude, and to top it off I inadvertently broke a queue (that I was at the front of) when the table number/jacket thing happened, so to top it off I got nasty looks. As I walked away I heard him apologizing to people for me. Very rude. Yes, I see this could all be a one off situation but they could have compensated with a pint or a HALF pint for crying out loud, or offering to change my order. Instead all I got was an awkward insincere sorry and left with a dish I have no desire to eat. So the only thing I can do is leave them this bad review. If I hadn't paid already I would have just walked out. Unfortunately I'm on the hook.",

It reminds me of my days back home at another popular joint I would brings my friends too.The vibe is a mix of young and old folks but I will let you know this place can get loud. That's fine by me!Typical England style, order all your items then pay, then the food will be delivered while you are enjoying your pint of beer.I had my mom with me and we were sitting in a row of small tables, when the person next to us also happen to be from the USA from Las Vegas! It's a small world after all...The food arrive in perfect timing, hot and delicious! My chicken pie was amazing, the crusty, flaky outside with a nice hot filling of chicken and white gravy. My mom's fish and chips were just as good!If you're ever in the Euston area of London, come have some pub fare and a couple of pints, in sure you'll enjoy the same great service that I did!Shout out to our waiter! He said Karen, but I think I neighbor heard incorrectly!NJoy!:)",

    "text": "Casual seat yourself and order at the bar environment. This establishment seems to attract a younger uni-style crowd which is cool. Ordered the fish and chips which were actually quite oily. Massive piece of cod though, which reflects the more expensive menu price for it. Atmosphere was really cool- authentic British style pub with nice decor. Servers were off about doing their own thing... Not too attentive at all. Quite sub-par service with only 2 workers visible during our visit. Chips were average, which was surprising seeing as I expected heaps more quality coming from London. They weren't soggy, but they could have definitely had a nicer crisp to them. The tartare sauce was the saviour of the meal. Amazing tartare for sure! Beef burger patty was big- an impressive amount of ounces for sure! It was juicy and had amazing chipotle sauce. Chips were thinner cut and crispier, although again they could have been made with a much bigger crunch to them!",

For food, I had the fish and chips, which was quite delicious: hot and crispy, with a nice tarter sauce. The chips left a little to be desired and the mash peas did not suit my palate at all.My son had the roasted chicken which was really the superior meal here. The chicken was quite nice and the parm crusted chips were good as well. If you're in the area and hungry, this is not a bad choice. The venue was a little bit interesting, with a revolutionary war painting overlayed with star wars light sabers that really lit up and a death star.",

We stumbled past this little gem and managed to bag the last seat outside which surprisingly in London wasn't too busy with cars or taxis. There was 5 us but only 4 eating - this is the type of place you can sit and relax and there was plenty of people both in and out doing just that early afternoon! I opted for a Aperol Spritz given the sunny day which was so refreshing and served with plenty of ice. Yum.We then ordered for some food - I went for the fish finger sandwich knowing it was a little while before I would eat again in the evening. It arrived promptly and looked amazing - towered lightly battered fish in a brioche bun with a side of fries. The batter was fab - not too heavy with the batter but lovely and crispy! Given the warm day and the atmosphere this place was exactly what we needed for a quick catch up in London when we needed it! Spot on - staff friendly and clean bar and toilets!",
