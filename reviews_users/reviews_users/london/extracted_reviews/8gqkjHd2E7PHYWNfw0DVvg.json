    "text": "So the name of the place is an obvious nod to Burger and Lobster ...But none the less I was stunned to see a Lobster roll on the menu ...The total lack of originality in this place actually resulted in some uncontrolled giggling from me at one point ... Ceilings after Polpo, menu after Burger and Lobster as well as obvious nods to Meat Liquor. General aesthetics a desperate attempt to look like an American diner but in blue to distinguish it ... Really not sure I want to be eating in such a cold feeling venue.Enough with the sneering at copy cat methodology ... Do I care if the Burger and shake is any good, who they stole from?It is indeed a burger inspired more by Burger and Lobster than by meat liquor ... soft Brioche bun and sweet tasting burger ... Obviously given the 7.95 price for a burger the meat isn't as good Burger and Lobster. It is however enormously better than the GBK across the road.And that is who they are clearly really aimed at competing with ...PS Shakes good but what is it with milkshake places in the UK that don't seem to believe in malt?",

    "text": "Having a 5:30pm craving for a dirty, greasy, American style cheeseburger (without the Covent Garden queue!) I popped into this place as it's near my work. The deep blue decor helps create a nice ambience, but the breezy welcome felt a little too forced (I didn't really need TABLE FOR ONE? bellowed quite so loudly in a fast food joint).Food was disappointing - while it looked great in its glossy bun, the burger lacked seasoning and flavour - unforgivable if you're going to cook medium rare. The bun itself was bland too, which meant all I could really taste was pickles and mustard. Fries looked cheap and felt more greasy than crisp. And putting out a single paper napkin per person seems miserly - put a dispenser on the table!If you're going to charge this much (\u00a314 with a Coke and service) you need to get the basics right every time, which wasn't the case on my visit.",

    "text": "The never-ending quest for the best burger continues! This time, Burger & Shake was up to bat. A new restaurant in the heart of Bloomsbury, Burger & Shake aims for cosy simplicity and it hits all the right notes. I know others have disparaged it for copying perhaps Shake Shack from NYC, Burger & Shake in Miami, and even Burger & Lobster here in London. But let's be honest, ever since McD's started serving up hamburgers and shakes for 10 cents back in the day, everything else has been a copy in some form or another. What matters is not where the original idea came from, but rather the execution of said idea. And when it comes to execution, Burger & Shake isn't perfect, but it does pretty damn well.First off, atmosphere. This is a small cosy shop with perhaps 8 booths seating 4 people and a couple of tables. Like most similar joints, it operates with a no reservations policy so get there early or be prepared to wait. At the moment, it's fairly unknown so you should be okay to get a seat in short order but I imagine it will start to fill up as word spreads. The staff are quite friendly and they use what looks like Samsung or Google tablets to take your order (yay tech!).Next, let's talk shakes. Since Rob H beat me to the obvious lyrical reference, I'll stick to what I know. As far as shakes go these are pretty good but they could be bigger. I always feel that a shake should be sufficiently large and/or thick that you can't finish it. I know it's a waste, but that's the experience I like. There are about 12 oz and moderately thick but still very easy to slurp up via a straw. The salted caramel was my preferred one although it benefitted from the extra salt added by Rob H. The chocolate tasted a tad too processed and reminded me of my chocolate protein shakes. I get the flavour they are aiming for, but it's just not natural. The strawberry was fairly mild and a pretty decent effort and I learned when it comes to shakes, Katie B dominates in taking them down.I had heard good things about the wings so naturally an order of those was in...well order. I find that most places here don't understand the concept of buffalo hot wings. B&S provides the best attempt I've seen to date with a sharp spicy hot sauce and a side of proper blue cheese dressing. The wings are almost perfect but could use a minute or two more in the fryer to give the skin a proper crispy crunch. The wings cooked just right with tender juicy flesh and large enough to be satisfying. I would have liked to see more dressing on the side (seriously, a tiny thimbleful is not enough for 16 wings), but that's a minor issue easily remedied.Finally, we get to the main event - the burger. We all opted for the house burger which is basically the hamburger (menu item #1) + American cheese (thus making it the cheeseburger which is offering #2) + cured bacon + condiments. First, let's see what they did well. The brioche bun was soft, fluffy, perfectly golden brown, and held together pretty well despite the amount of meat juice and sauces. The burger patty was cooked to perfection and exhibited a juicy texture with plenty of pink and a rich meaty taste. The bacon was a nice touch although I wish they had trimmed the each of the fat off - you know, that bit that is stringy and catches in your teeth? I didn't even notice pickles and a bit more acidity would have been a nice touch. Another minor gripe was the slight dryness to the edge of the brioche which tugged at the teeth with every bite and made it feel as if the bun was just a tad stale. However, my major issue is with the size of the burger. It's tiny! For \u00a39, I want more than a measly 6oz of meat as that is nowhere near enough to fill me up. The waitress suggested I could always order two burgers but for close to \u00a320, I'd expect something spectacular as they would start encroaching on Bar Bolud territory.Finally, I opted for the only dessert on the menu in order to give you, my faithful readers, a complete review. The dessert was a peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake - essentially attempting to be a Reeses peanut butter cup. Which is fine but you need the get all the flavours in there. The peanut taste was well balanced with enough flavour you got the idea but not so much you felt that you had been digging into a jar of Skippy's chunky. The chocolate, however, was non-existent and a bit of a let down as I was expecting that sweet milky taste to balance out the nuttiness. Overall, an alright dessert but I wish I had skipped it and settled for a chocolate fondant at home.Well there you have it. As far as London burgers go, it's above average but not enough to break into the top 3 due to its small size and thus poor value proposition. As far as a burger place, I quite enjoyed it for the atmosphere, d\u00e9cor, and speed of service.And for those of you keeping track, that's #400.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for a quick bite to eat before meeting up with people for some wine tasting. I was the first one there (it was quite early), but it started filling up as I was in there.I started with the salted caramel shake. And thankfully, they do proper American-style milkshakes instead of those weird British-style ones. (Sorry folks, a milkshake without ice cream is just weird.) It was thick and delicious. Definitely the highlight of the place.I got the house burger (because if it's going to be the house burger, it should be great, right?) and a small order of Buffalo wings (been in the wing craze since Orange Buffalo). The wings were tasty. Not overly spicy, but pretty close to the standard wings you'd get in the US. I could have used a bit more dipping sauce because I like my wings blue cheese-y, but things were tasty. The burger was good. Medium rare on a brioche bun. Kind of fell apart a bit, but incredibly juicy. However, their special sauce on it was pretty tasteless.Definitely not the best burger I've had in London, but it was good. Although if I were craving a shake, I might come back. And if I do come back, I saw some chili on the menu that has my name on it.",

It attempts to look something like a diner with it's booth seating, but falls short with a lack of decor and uninspired atmosphere. BUT - not all is lost!What it lacks in character, it makes up for in deliciousness and quality. The burgers are top notch (seriously, so good), the milkshakes are proper American style and the staff are extremely friendly. It's all a bit cheaper than other Burger-serving competitors, so it gets a nod from me.",

    "text": "I know it's called Burger and Shake but I'm giving this a 4 star for the wings. I'm all about the wings. I went for lunch with my colleague as we work pretty close by. We shared a pulled pork roll (juicy and totally yum), jalapeno burger (not hot enough for my liking but still good), coleslaw (portion was BIG and pretty good) and 4 buffalo wings (HEAVEN) plus 2 drinks. Did we over order for lunch - umm, yes but I won't admit it if you ever ask me. Side note. I want to have my say of: They count by whole wings hence 4 wings was really 8 pieces. I like that they did that cause that is a slight pet peeve of mine. The drumette is not a separate wing, TOGETHER with the mid-section (and tip) they make a WING!Lunch time can be busy here so maybe book a table if it's not a impromptu decision to come here. They do a \u00a310 lunch deal as well, it's a drink, fries and a basic burger or cheese burger - I think that's pretty good if it's what you're looking for. Would definitely come again and recommend to people in the area. It's a bit pricey so not everyday lunch but definitely payday lunch! Now I guess I'll have to try the shakes next....",

I was starving because I pretty much hadn't had anything to eat the entire day and I was a little half baked from smoking a joint earlier on (I was also really hungry because of that). We sit down and while it is a little crowded and lively, I enjoyed the energy. Our orders were quickly taken and our food arrives not too long after and it looks absolutely delicious. We ordered the jalapeno poppers and they were fairly good -- a nice thin crunchy texture on the outside and a warm cheesy filling on the inside. The dip that was offered with it went well with it as well.As for our burgers, I ordered the pulled pork hamburger. It sounded like it had a ridiculous amount of meat in it and I love meat so I went for it. I was not disappointed. The burger has a beautifully cooked, thick, medium rare patty, and on top of it there was a healthy amount of pulled pork soaked in barbecue sauce. To cut through the richness of the meat there was a layer of lettuce (and it did its job quite well). All in all, a really solid hamburger for a very reasonable price. It was incredibly filling and I went for a nap almost immediately after.",

We stopped in, originally planning to get lunch at the cafe next door, but because the line was so long we settled for burgers. Their custom is to cook the burgers medium, but I asked for well done. The burger was delicious and juicy, and the fries were perfectly crispy. The \"special sauce\" was reminiscent of tartar sauce, which was not bad, but not similar to the thousand island-like special sauces that we have in the states.

The restaurant is small and service is quick and great. I didn't think the price point was too bad, and remembering that you don't tip in most of Europe also makes the prices a little cheaper. I had the House Burger and it was delicious!! They do seem to prefer their burgers here a little less cooked than I would say is typical in America, so make sure to ask for Medium or Medium well to make sure the burger is cooked right. Burgers do not come with a side, so make sure to order a side if you are wanting a side!",

US beers (SIERRA NEVADA PALE ALE, I'LL TAKE YOU) and fizzy drinks served cold in glass bottles. There are a range of burger options, from pretty basic (patty and special sauce) to pulled pork and the special (though it's fairly regularly an item): a shrimp burger, which is mixed with salmon, jalape\u00f1os and garlic for some kick. I recommend the latter as it's something a little different.The buns are GREAT; soft and pillowy and toasted and buttery. Carb-phobics beware.As seems to be standard at many of London's top burger spots: you get a burger. Full stop. No fries included or fancy sides. So you tack those on. I didn't, but I looked enviously on as another munched on wings and a side of hot sauce-doused fries. Envious: TOP LEVELS.In sum: really solid option in the area. Staff friendly, vibe good, nothing fancy.Yelp note: if you sit in the back booth by the ice-cream maker and it happens to be in \"churn mode\" it can be...noisy. I know I sound like an old grump saying this, but: I truly couldn't hear! Depending on your company that might be an advantage? I dunno. I leave that up to you. But: noisy booth at times!",

It didn't take long for me to get over this guilt after seeing the burgers in the windows. They have tons of options, including a vegetarian option. We went with the pulled pork burger and it was FANTASTIC. Probably one of the best burgers I've had at a restaurant. It was cooked medium rare (my favorite) and was dripping with juicy goodness. We also ordered the mac & cheese with bacon, as well as a strawberry shake. I didn't find the mac & cheese that good at all. It was somewhat cold and tasted like store-bought mac & cheese. The shake was a little small, but very delicious. We ordered the strawberry, but they have tons of flavors (e.g., chocolate, banana, salted caramel, etc.).Overall, a great stop in London.

I have had lunch-time burger cravings before, but although GBK isn't bad, it is always let down by the appalling service...so this new burger joint is a welcome new edition to Russell Square. With this in mind, I think the previous reviewer, Sid was a little harsh.Nom:* The cheeseburger was lovely, juicy and filling (with a soft brioche bun)* There was a veggy option with haloumi if you have non-meat-loving friends* My Muslim colleague was chuffed to see they serve both pork and beef hotdogs* The salted caramel shake was sweet, yummy and ridiculously huge! I am glad I shared mine, or I would have been too full to move!!* The staff were friendly and sweet* The cocktails looked lovely, but we couldn't try them - seriously, who has a cocktail with a burger for a normal Tuesday lunch!?Slightly less impressive:* I liked the chicken wings, but they weren't particularly special. I don't think I'd order them again. (Although my colleague loooved the cheese-y dipping sauce that they came with!)* I thought it was just a bit too pricey for lunch (\u00a38ish for a burger, \u00a34 milkshake, \u00a35 wings is waaay more than I normally spend at lunch time!)So all in all...I like it, but it is a little out of my lunchtime price range!",

I've had lots of good burgers in London but I had yet to find a place that also offers milkshakes. First, the milkshake. I ordered the mint one, which I wasn't aware was a possible flavour but was extremely excited about because I love mint. It was so thick and creamy and absolutely delicious! One of the best milkshakes I've ever had. Served in the stainless steel cup with a straw, frosted and freezing cold. Perfect. Next our burgers. We ordered the hamburger and the chicken burger with two small sides of fries. Everything about the burgers were so good: the bun, the toppings, the beef, the deep fried chicken especially! My boyfriend enjoyed the fries but unfortunately I did not, some were a bit soggy and reminded me of In-n-Out fries which I don't like. More of personal preference but I'm still glad I tried them. Aside from the food the location is also spot on, very close to Bloomsbury campuses. The meal for the two of us was kind of pricey (\u00a323) but it was definitely worth it. Next time I just won't get the fries.",

    "text": "Yum! \u00a0I'm not the world's greatest burger fan being a pescatarian and veggie/fish burgers can often be a disappointment. \u00a0However, it's difficult at the moment to avoid burgers as they seem to be available everywhere. \u00a0However, Burger and Shake did not disappoint.It's a small restaurant with an American diner style decor. \u00a0We sat in a booth which was a bit cosy. \u00a0There are a range of burgers on the menu with sides and also a specials board. \u00a0The milkshakes looked very tasty although also very filling so I declined although I may be tempted in future. \u00a0There was also a range of bottled beers which seemed a bit expensive albeit from a non Londoners perspective.I had a shrimp burger which was a patty made from salmon and prawns which held it's shape well in addition to being very tasty. \u00a0The bun and aioli sauce accompanied the patty well. \u00a0We also shared chips and onion rings which came in good sized portions. \u00a0The onion rings in particular were very good as they were crispy and not limp,Service was good although a discretionary service charge was applied to the bill which can be controversial for some.",
