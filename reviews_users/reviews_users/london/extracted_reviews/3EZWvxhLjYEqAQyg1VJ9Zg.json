But there are hidden diamonds in the dirt. And this restaurant is one of them diamonds. The d\u00e9cor is fantastic, something you see from a Chinese movie , you'll never expect something so fabulous to actually be somewhere other than China Town. As you walk in, you see a waterfall with fishes in a fantastic pond or low fish tank!! And you are welcomed inside which some ushers wearing their native wear \"which you rarely see any more\" The staff are fantastic, the presentation of the tables are grand. Now the Food!!!! For the price the food is fantastic, I love the sizzling hot plates, you don't have to wait so long for delicious food, and everything is presented to you very nicely as well. Their Dim sum, is what made me love dim sum so much right now. And their food isn't that costly either. For all this great food, you get exactly what you bargain for, and I have been there 5 times after. I am actually about to plan my friends surprise birthday here.",

We've been there several times and were always pleased with it. The prices are of good value compared to the quality of food and restaurant interior. You could take someone there on a romantic dinner or a large celebration dinner. We usually go there for dim sum and order about 10 dishes for two of us, some beer and chinese tea and end up paying around \u00a310-15 per person. There is a large amount of waiters there and gets busy on weekend evenings. The restaurant actually reminded us of restaurants in China or Singapore with the quiet background music, soft light, chandeliers, and waterfall feature in the entrance hall along with pleasant music playing in the toilets. The toilets are clean, modern and of a higher calibre than other restaurants in London in general.",

    "text": "If you're REALLY into dim sum (and to be honest, what kind of person are you if you're not excited by an endless parade of fried, baked and steamed meaty treasures) then it might be worth a trip to Elephant and Castle, home of Dragon Castle. I've been nudged about this place for several years by Hong Kong Cantonese foodie friends who describe it as a home from home. Despite its unpromising location, surrounded by condemned tower blocks situated off the bleakest roundabout in Zone One, it is where a lot of expats go for their fix.The grander than expected entrance opens out into a pleasant space. Location and swift customer turnover aside, they've made an effort to go to town on the interior. Lazy fat carp swim in an ornamental pool reflecting the boarded up walkways of the Heygate estate opposite. It's a hell of a lot of feng shui to lump on a couple of fish, but they stalwartly shoulder (or fin?) the responsibility.Arriving in traditional plates of three or four items, this is a meal best served family style. If there's not an argument about who hasn't had enough of what, it's not proper. Take a table with the slowly revolving 'lazy Susan' and order a lot: you'll eat it... At around \u00a33 a portion, Dragon Castle is cheaper than most of Chinatown and for a full dim sum blowout washed down with the traditional Jasmine tea, you'll be lucky to top \u00a315 a head between a decent sized group of you.There's always been debate around whether Dragon Castle has a 'secret' Cantonese menu of local treats, rich in flavour and texture, that they won't serve to Westerners. I've heard this several times, mainly from Cantonese clientele, though on thorough investigation, I've put it down to rumour and the fact that many Chinese won't order from a menu here, they'll simply request their favourites and those will get made. Those that do hit up the menu will find it vast. Well over 40 assorted dumplings, buns, puffs and braised bits of tendon to work your way through. To get to the good stuff, I photocopied the menu, took a straw poll of several Cantonese team mates, and gave their recommendations to the waitstaff, asking simply for two portions of everything (there were a few of us, 16 to be precise, a lot of mouths to fill with dumplings...)The steamed dumplings, particularly the prawn varieties, went down swiftly, as did the various baked pork puffs, hot from the oven, sticky glaze attaching to teeth. Various roast pork buns also proved a success, sweeter than expected. Silken mixed Chung fun and belly sticking turnip cake provided a smooth break to the textural proceedings and from the cryptic end of the menu, Crab Pork Little Lanterns were a marmite call. Deep-fried hollow egg-shaped shells with an almost mucous paste inside, sheltering an umami-rich pork filling. I could have eaten them all afternoon, though a fellow diner paused between his mouthfuls of textured chicken foot tendon to describe them as pointless clag. We both looked at each other's bowls and laughed. It's the joy of good dim sum, everyone has their favourites and there's (almost) something for everyone.",

However the atmosphere inside puts paid to any doubts about the place - it's often full (though not quite - it's huge enough for there to always be space for a few more people) and buzzes with a totally mixed crowd. The food is very fresh and the tea is good, all tied together with speedy and efficient servers. I was assured by my partner in crime (that one below me that spent quite some time in China) that it is some of the best he's had in London. I was in a fit of hangover at the time so wanted something comforting and simple - I went for sweet and sour pork. I appreciate this is the equivalent of ordering a chicken tikka masala, but if somewhere can get the basics down, they're doing it right. It was great. The dumplings we had were also very good, with a superb texture which held the szechuan sauce very well. Yes, I was pleased with the Dragon Castle, not just another Chinese restaurant, and intend to return with a stomach (and budget) set for more of an adventurous meal.",

Food was some of the best Chinese that I have had in London, with the Szechuan beef stew in particular bringing back memories of time spent in China. I must mention that I didn't find Dragon Castle to be quite the super cheap bargain that some of the other reviews had led me to believe, although it is not overpriced by any stretch. A starter and main each, with boiled rice and green tea, came to \u00a320/head with a tip which I think this is good value for the quality of the food.

    "text": "Not sure why, but the average review of restaurants in London's Chinatown can range from average (good food, terrible service) to awful (terrible food, terrible service). So I decided to take my mateys away from the throng of central London and go to my family's favourite dim sum haunt, Dragon Castle (100 Walworth Rd, Elephant & Castle). A short walk from the tube station, I've only visited it by day - but in the evening it seems to undergo a slight transformation....sparkly chandeliers, dimmed lights, upmarket chairs and a change of table configurations. The restaurant is modern, large and spacious and they pipe out cheesy pop music (S Club 7 to Jennifer Lopez to Lady Antebellum...this pop princess was very happy indeed). We decided to go for a set menu which looked very good value - starter platter with the usual fare (spring rolls, ribs, prawn toast etc) very generous and not greasy. The second course was the obligatory crispy duck and pancakes (duck was tasty and there were more than enough pancakes for everyone). The final course consisted of \u00a0plates of stir fry veg, a tasty seabass in soy sauce with spring onion and ginger, chilli beef, prawns with onions served in a pastry case and fried rice. By the last course we were totally stuffed, but very happy that we'd had a tasty, good quality meal in lovely surroundings. Service was friendly and efficient - my friends had their wine glasses regularly topped up with no need to prompt the waiters (by the way the wine portions were generous). The set menu we chose was \u00a323 per head not including drink - a lovely evening had by all so check it out. (By the way the loos are modern, clean and spacious - you can't say that about the average chinese restaurant loo!)",

We started of with a cold platter of jellyfish done in sesame seeds and garnished with raw garlic. This was followed by crispy pork with golden crushed garlic which was meaty but not overpowering;the squid was soft and not soggy;the steamed corn-fed chicken in ginger stock was intense accompanied by a sauce containing whitepepper and star-anise.

The Dragon Castle is a huge Chinese restaurant in Elephant & Castle, South London, complete with glittering fountain and tasteful lighting, serving a wide choice of vegetarian food also. Very easy to find - park in Larcom Street, nearby. Concentrating on the vegetarian menu, the food was extremely good, great-tasting and imaginative. We like their plentiful portions. I would also like to add that I have had cashews a thousand times but never as good as in this place, they literally melted in the mouth. They even serve the rice in whatchamacall-it stacks that keep it warm. We used their expensive chopsticks and found it all very manageable to pick up, except the aubergine. If you want a fork, ask for it at the beginning because this place gets really busy. We enjoyed just sitting there in that huge dining hall, with its elegant high ceilings. The waitresses were authentically dressed. Plates, service, ambience were all really positive but you know me, it has to taste good for me to write about it. The food in this restaurant is excellent. We'll be taking lots of friends there, especially business contacts from out of London as its impressive dining at roughly \u00a320 per head for a la carte, which includes 3 courses, no dessert.

So I told the waitress I ordered a pint and it's well short so she took it back and I heard the bartender open another can and fill it a little more. Draught and a can taste completely different. If they are this dishonest with the drinks I don't want to eat their food. I paid my bill (which they tried to charge me a service fee on) and left.",

They marinade everything else in modern soy sauce. Surprisingly difficult to communicate dietary restriction for gluten, even though they have an extensive allergen list in the back of the menu. They were accomidating none the less and it was delicious! Best authentic Chinese food in the Elephant & Castle/Southwark area hands down! The service is extremely prompt and commendable. Even though I only had one option, I would definitely eat there again!!!! A fantastic and affordable unoaked chardonnay on the wine list too!",

Get anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. The most recent time I came, I was with a small group. We ordered the enoki mushrooms with Japanese tofu, salt and chilli pepper pork and chicken with black bean sauce. The mushrooms with Japanese tofu was a big hit at our table and we gobbled it up quickly! Additionally 3 bowls of rice and a serving of the tapioca pearls in mango cream with pomelo for pudding. The bill came to \u00a350 including tip. Which I think is reasonable considering how much food we had and the speed of service. Highly recommend coming here! Dragon Castle is ace!",

They don't take bookings... There is pretty much all of the yum Cha goodness that you would hope for and a couple of interesting bits too. The seafood based dumplings were all excellent especially the standard prawn and the scallop one too. I really don't think you can go wrong with these dumplings unless you are allergic to shellfish and gluten free all at the same time.The staff have service down to a fine art and it's hard to eat slowly because the food is too delicious and it comes out all at once. And they want your table back. The chilli isn't all that hot and fresh chilli will cost you. Tea is refilled extremely fast and the bathrooms are immaculate. Suitable for big and small groups. Warning: many badly behaved children likely to be present on Sunday's.",

    "text": "I don't eat Chinese food often in London, but overall I've been disappointed with my prior dim sum experiences compared to what you find in the US, and having lived for a bit in Hong Kong. My first two tries were in Chinatown at New World (terrible quality) and Joy King Lau (extremely expensive), but I read about Dragon Castle, a random authentic Chinese restaurant by Elephant & Castle, and decided that it was worth a shot.We arrived at 11:45 AM, only to discover that the place does not open until 12, so we waited for a few minutes and it was not a big deal. People joined us soon after and the restaurant was reasonably full, but it would not be difficult to just walk in and get a seat. In Chinatown, I have always had to queue and the restaurants are packed, so it was nice that this place was calm and less stressful. It's also well decorated and pretty elegant, and there were families dining with well behaved young children, just an overall good environment.You order off a menu, not a cart, and the food comes out fairly quickly. \u00a0I ordered most of my favorites, like the soup dumplings, turnip cake, chive and prawn dumpling, and sticky rice in lotus leaf. Everything was very good but what stood out was a prawn dumpling that came in a green spinach wrap. There is also a scallop option that we didn't order, which I would very much like to try in the future.In the end, the bill came out to about 13 pounds a person, which is nothing like the sub-10 dollar prices you will find for dim sum in the US, but very cheap for London standards. I would definitely recommend this for authentic dim sum and look forward to coming back in the future.",

    "text": "I'd walked past Dragon Castle many a time on my way to Longdan, my favourite Asian grocery store. It's bright Chinese decor caught my eye, but it's massive menu of dim sum was what drew me in. Secondly, I have watched the people going in and out of Dragon Castle. The majority of its customers are Chinese, and judge me but I want to eat where they are eating. I came one night in hopes of dim sum but be warned, it is only for lunch!! So I settled on pork dumplings and Sichuan chili chicken. Dumplings for me are a key indicator of a good Chinese restaurant. I live and die for good dumplings. \u00a0Service wise, the waiters are decent. I didn't want to get something like sweet and sour chicken, so I told my waiter that I wanted his recommendation for what he thought was best. My only requirement was that it had to be spicy. He mumbled for a bit and then we settled on the chili chicken. Not horrible but not the best assistance from a waiter. The pork dumplings came out pretty quickly. They were quite large for a dumpling, 3 large bites for each. The breeding was more doughy than I prefer, but the filling made up for the lack of crisp that I like. The pork was juicy and salty, with juices oozes out with each bite. They do not have soy sauce on the table, but they bring some mix of soy and a vinegar. I asked for a chili oil and it was actually excellent. Not too spicy, with a great flavor. Next came the chili chicken. Okay, I have a love/hate relationship with this dish. First off, flavor wise it was great. Spicy, salty and crunchy. BUT, and a huge but, there is something (bones/ligaments or tendons) in the chicken bites that are not visible and very off putting while eating.Overall, I would definitely go back! My entire meal with a drink and tip came out to around \u00a323. However, I will be returning for lunch next time around.",

We were served, fed and handed the bill in 30 minutes. The food isn't standout, but it's fine. I ordered a Satay beef with rice sticks. I imagined this to be dry jenga-like blocks of rice. It was more fat, glutinous noodles.Vegetable spring rolls were chunky and tasty.I wouldn't rave about it but it's a good option considering Walworth Road isn't exactly heaving with decent eateries. Top tip: the huge red doors at the front? Not the entrance! It's the smaller nondescript door to the right of it.",

I live in the area and after a long day I was a little hungry and went to Dragon Castle with a friend. When we went in, the interior was pretty nice, but very empty at the same time. It seems like they have a huge space but no one really goes in? There were a few people that came and got Take Out (take away).I ordered the West Lake Beef soup and my friend ordered the duck over rice dish. My soup was super salty and to me, it was VERY small. But then again, it was just a bowl of soup. My friend was stunned to see the duck had all the bones still intact, silly. Anyway the duck looked decent but if you're not one to eat and then spit out the bones then I suggest you order a different dish. I don't know if I'll go back. SoCal & Taiwan spoiled me. Chinese food just doesn't taste good here.",

It's much closer than the Bakerloo line exit and you don't have to do the wandering around or under the roundabout.Pro tip 2: they only seat complete tables, so make sure everyone in your party has decent directions, not just the address.",

Except, that is Dragon Castle; it's authentic and excellent value. On my last visit with a similarly fearless trencherman, a spread of a good ten or so dishes, washed down with copious quantities of tea and Tsingtao beer, came to somewhere under 30 pounds a head, probably no more than 2/3 of what we would have paid for the same in Chinatown. This probably explains why it is heavingly busy, catering to a mixed clientele of Chinese and in-the-know South Londoners, If you're thinking of going for a pint before or after though, my serious advice is to get back on the tube and go somewhere else, as the Walworth Road is very sparse when it comes to nice places.",
