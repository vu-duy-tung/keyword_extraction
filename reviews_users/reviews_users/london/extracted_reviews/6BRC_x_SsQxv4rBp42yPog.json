It's trying to very hard to be an upscale posh restaruant but when you've come in for lunch and you need to get back, it's hard to justify the 45 min wait from ordering to delivery for mussles and mac & cheese. Ya it was posh and the mac & cheese came in a fancy copper pot thing but really, it's mac & cheese for goodness sake! I'd say it's good for lunch meetings where you have 3 or 4 hours but not for lunch.",

    "text": "Some venues do one simple thing really well - others spread themselves too thinly and do everything pretty poorly. Villandry, however, seems to be a rare example of a place which manages to do lots of things extremely well. I was treated to a wine tasting which tied in to a product launch - and for this the venue was ideal. The place is vast and our hosts had picked a corner which seemed secluded, though the restaurant was busy and bustling on a Thursday evening. The wines served were truly excellent - this would be a perfect place to come if you're after a special bottle, whether you're drinking in or taking away. Canapes were pretty and scrummy and beautifully coordinated with the wines - though my fave was the mini dessert tarts and they went with nothing except each other and a slightly dizzy head. I'd really like to come here for dinner, drinks or a bit of both - there's great street seating, lots of media types, great decor and it seems fun in the summer. Perfect!",

Unctuous hot slabs (yes I said slabsand unctuous) of freshly roasted beef, lamb or chicken which the staff pile high onto a variety of yummy in store baked breads or rolls. But thats not all no you get a choice of toppings which include hot grilled & marinated aubergines, hot roasted tomatoes, homemade chutneys, cheeses, saladthe list goes on. Add your sauce on top of that and then watch the staff struggle to wrap up your creation in foil lined paper to keep it warm. It doesn't stand a chance of getting cold with me as it's already halfway gone before I leave the shop! Staff are friendly and give you exactly what you want - plus at around \u00a34/4.50 I personally think for the size of these god like creations and the fact that it is an up market store, you can't beat it. Tip: make sure you grab plenty of napkins as these babies are juicy!",

The Champagne was better; but they served our starter too quickly. The Ribs were mediocre; as were the Scallops. The service in the Villandry was unusual; when our main course of turkey was served to us stone cold, our waiter (who seemed to be the maitre'd!) said that he was going to \"give my chef hell\". It seemed to work. The meal came back at a decent temperature, but wasn't anything special. Medium/High price for what it was (160 for a two people); claustrophobic (we really shouldn't have to put our wine on the next table since the plates couldn't fit on our table otherwise). Ok as a lunch venue, but I'll be skipping it for dinner in future.",

So I waited while my guest ate his crab cakes. I waited some more and asked two waitresses where my food was, no satisfactory answer just a \"sorry\". My fish salad (how long does it take to make a salad with cold smoked fish???) arrived after my guest had finished eating. The waitress said she would speak to her manger and try to do something for me. The Manageress produced the bill and I asked her what she had done to show some consideration for making my guest sit and watch me eat. She said she had given us complimentary coffee's. Not surprisingly I challenged this and said whilst she was free to give anything she chooses, I am also free to choose where I eat (and what I write on the internet). She went away and took the price of the delayed fish salad off the bill. So it what are my impressions that may be of use to other readers? Firstly, the food was good and reasonably priced. The staff were very average, unenthusiastic and certainly not keen to delight customers (probably a management issue). I'd be prepared to give this place another go just for the food, but if the service (attitude) hasn't improved, it wont get another chance.",

The food (whose style is French-Italian-ish) was excellent, although I ordered the Steak Tartare without realising it would be raw meat - but everything else was very tasty and freshly prepared, and the portions were neither too small nor too big, just right. I also liked the atmosphere of that place, as the last reviewer said, it's a nice small restaurant next to a deli (they actually also serve some food and drink at the deli which I tried ages ago, but as far as I can remember, it was also delicious). I didn't mind the open windows, in fact, it made the place feel a bit more Southern European and relaxed. I also found that the menu was a bit limited, but they have daily changing specials which is a plus. I went with my mom who doesn't speak a lot of English, and the waiter was happy to switch to French and even Spanish. Altogether, a great place which I will be happy to visit again.",

There is a story behind it...I always walk past Villandry and it's always busy in there so my friends and I wanted to see what the fuss is all about and whether it lives up to what we see.A while back I booked a table for 4 for dinner with my friends only to find out that they haven't reserved a table for us... although they said they can offer us a table in some corner of the restaurant, hidden in some tiny room where no one could really see us and it wasn't a private room, it was just a corner. As it was a very hot summer evening, we asked to be sit elsewhere (since the restaurant was empty) and they said they're all booked. So we gratefully walked out and never looked back.Another friend had a bad experienced recently and ended up walking out again (so it didn't only happen to me). She was pregnant and when she ordered a full breakfast, the sausage arrived RAW! She told them that it was raw and she's pregnant so she can't eat it raw but he insists that this restaurant serve raw pork sausage. She found that very strange (and so did I when I was told). The waiter was rude and unhelpful. He didn't even give her other suggestion. It was basically eat or get out kind of attitude. They were extremely unhappy with their customer services, paid for their drinks (not breakfast as they couldn't eat it) and walked off. From this 2 experiences, I don't think I can ever go back there to try their food and I don't think I'm missing anything out.",

Marylebone high street is quiet a close walk from here.They have free baking lessons for kids; Little People's Cookie classes every Saturday at 1:00pm, but call to check in first. Saturday gets perfect when you wake up and crave for freshly baked bread with coffee, uuumm Villandry it is then.

The food was good, but not worth writing home about. I had the mushroom soup (poured tableside, an unnecessary flourish for such a crowded space in my opinion) followed by the plat du jour which happened to be salmon pie and French beans. \u00a0Good but not particularly special, and I was glad by the end of it that the meal was going on an expense account.",

They have cooking stations where you can have the daily noodles prepared freshly for you, a choice of fajitas and a \"choose your own\" salad section.If you sit down, you can have any of the above plus a choice of fresh salads, sandwiches and meat or cheese plates.It's not cheap and when it's great quality food like this, you don't mind paying for it but \u00a32.50 for a can of diet coke puts a bit of a downer on it all for me.",

I have been to Villandry twice now and I still haven't a clue what their main area of retail sale is.I came in here around Christmas Eve hoping to score some meats and cheeses for a little get together we were having at our flat. After looking around and seeing one measly little slice of brie and no meat at all, I was quite confused. Isn't this a place with cheese and Charcutterie plates? I asked and they looked at me as though I had just asked if Goats make better lovers?Very confused and empty handed I left and just went to Sainsbury down the street. Then today, I met my friend here for some food in the back and it started to make more sense. Ahhh, so it's a restaurant with a gift shop? Maybe? Hmm. I ordered some pasta and a glass of Chilean Sauv Blanc and as I perused the menu further I saw it... Meat and Cheese!?!? What the hell? I thought they didn't carry that.Point being, don't ask me the reason for this store because I really don't understand. Oh well.",

    "text": "dont give bad reveiws often but here is one that is a must....Visiting London for the first time I was surprised by the lack of good customer service especially at the restaurants. Villandry especially, just couldnt wait to get home before rating this a generous one star. First morning in town I opted to go to Villandry for a latte verses the well known Starbucks across the street. Support the local shops right??? Well after ordering my latte I attempted to make small talk with the lady about whether it was a new place since things seemed fresh and \"new\" only to receive a snappy answer about how she wasnt new but have worked there for 3 years! I corrected her garding my question and she scoffed off and said they were just changing things around. Since i asked for \"take away\" i asked if it was okay to sit for a little before taking off only to recieve \u00a0(not exaggerating) a lecture on what take away meant. I was shocked and just said \"uh huh\" and left. I heard her say something in polish under her breath.Needing some wifi I mistakenly went back but this time opted for dine in. Sat down and was brought a menu immediately and asked wht i would like to drink (why do these places think you know immediately when you sit down wht they offer to drink?) thought wow maybe things have turned for the better. Ordered my latte and asked if they had wifi. The waitress replied yes but it doesnt work for macs apple products. Hmm could it be because i had an ipad in my hand? The barista delivered the latte to me and I gave him my food order and he said id hae to wait for my waitress. After connecting to wifi !!!! I knew she was lying because I had used their wifi outside already, drinking all my coffee and waiting a few mins still no waitress. The two tables being served by another had sat down ordered received their lattes ordered food and recieved it \u00a0while i still had my menu in hand. I stopped their waiter and said said i was going to eat but now id jut like the bill. He apologized and said he was sorry for the delay. I was willing to pay for my beverage but he gave it to me for free.i di make a ruckus and all the people there knew was up. I hope the manager heard as well. Their waiter was practically dumbfounded as if they had good service. i give him props for giving me the free cafe though.2 strikes and they are out. NEVER again. I hope others also realized that this establishment is rude and needs a lesson on what custmer service is and yelps. \u00a0Maybe i should offer an american lecture to them!!!!",

This was fine except I was barely tended to at all, I had to beckon a waiter over to order a drink, even though they were constantly topping up my friends and serving coffees, teas, juices etc. I was never asked if I wanted another drink again. They also did not serve/offer water which I think is strange as people were drinking a fair amount. My friend actually had to walk to the bar to get water. The food was good, had the chargrilled chicken sandwich, yum. Friends all liked their breakfast too. The service was just faaaaaar too slow, we were there for over three hours! It took forever to bring our mains and it wasn't busy. Overall a good value deal for the brunch for sure, but they'd do well to cater to everyone- it's not difficult, just one additional person not drinking! Nice place but wouldn't go there again. Liked the St James one though!",

    "text": "I was wavering on three stars; Villandry might have skated on mediocrity alone, but at this price point, that's just not acceptable.Service was incredibly spotty: the young man at the door was bored, inattentive, and distracted; one of our waitresses was fantastic; another botched a simple order; two separate men fumbled simple etiquette. Really odd.Menu options were surprisingly slim, but then, we came at an odd time--early dinner. We ended up with two different sorts of fried calamari (one regular, one \"spicy\") and beef carpaccio as starters, pumpkin ravioli and a lemongrass shrimp dish as mains, several drinks, dessert.For a French restaurant, everything felt oddly Italian--from the Italian waitress (the good one) to the dishes. The calamari were clunky, floury, overly-breaded, and bland: sort of like drywall wrapped around each piece of squid, which is an unfortunate thing to do to a tasty animal. The \"spicy\" version had a few Thai red pepper slices tossed in along with them. That and the dipping sauce were the only differences between the \"regular\" and \"spicy.\" The carpaccio was fine, but it lacked any hint of acidity, brine, or bite: without vinegar, capers, or just a dash of sea salt, the meat just tastes bland, and the arugula and Grano Padano couldn't make up for the lack of basic seasoning. Again, decent base ingredient, botched execution.I can't comment on the shrimp, though they looked plump and the portion was ample, but the pumpkin ravioli felt like a \"fresh\" pasta dish from a shop. If the pasta was made in-house, it certainly wasn't made today (or yesterday, for that matter). The filling was bland, but had some adequate pumpkin flavour. However, aside from a tiny handful of barely-oily arugula (the same from the carpaccio?) and three sun-dried tomatoes, there was no sauce. And that's fine, but how about some olive oil, at least? A spoonful of pesto? Anything? No? No. Just dry ravioli on a tepid plate, with a small handful of arugula on top. At least the \"Aspen\" fries (frozen fries tossed with grated Parm and a drizzle of white truffle oil) were good, though they were served in a shallow, slippery bowl which meant none of us could get at one with a fork without sending another flying. Awkward.Cocktails were boring but there was nothing essentially wrong with them. Dessert fell short, as well; my partner's sea salt caramel and walnut tart was in a stodgy, hard crust (is this place seriously claiming to be French?) and had a tinny flavour reminiscent of stale caramels left in a box with no hint of walnut aside from the single walnut half pressed into the thick caramel topping. My creme brulee was fine, though it came out fifteen minutes after everyone else had finished their dessert because my waitress thought \"creme brulee\" meant \"crumble.\" Unless you think I'm pronouncing crumble \"crumble-lay,\" I'm not sure how you mess that up. I shouldn't be surprised; this was the gal who didn't know what a cafe au lait was--French? What French? We finally settled on an Americano with milk for that guest.Despite the espresso machine at the bar, the espresso wasn't made with fresh beans and the particular bitterness hinted at significant over-extraction. As is the norm with such exercises in futility, it was an overpriced afterthought made by someone without a clue.Nothing about this place, aside from its veneer, spoke of a fine dining experience. The only good part about this meal was that I didn't have to pay for it.Avoid.",

Coffee was fine, service was OK ish ( oh-so-slightly condescending - perhaps because they \"got\" the place and I didn't), but I did rather object to the charge ( \u00a32 or so) to cater for one guest's request for a cup of hot water with a slice of lemon.

I went again very recently with work colleagues, and came back equipped with a better sense of what this place was really all about.I entered through the stunning foodstore (and you will too), however unimpressively and unattractively priced. I would recommend spending a few minutes here to glance through the gastrospectrum.The first thing I noticed once I walked into the restaurant, and surprisingly so, was that the restaurant didn't seem like a popular place for a Friday evening (or that it was Jan 6, and the vacationing patrons of Villandry were not back from their respective sojourns.) Either way, that seemed like a note of caution. The last time around, I remember that the place was buzzing with chatter.The wine list is impressive, but dear. That can never be fun.With the least pricey main at \u00a314.20, Villandry is not the best bargain in town, but I suppose it could be worse, given the location of the place.Starters - the ham hock terrine is a definite order, and supremely memorable. The beet/goats cheese is a great nibble (and turns out it works fairly well if you try it out at home as well).The chicken breast main was nice; juicy and succulent. Definitely fresh, and clearly speaks about the chef's attention to prep detail. If you can make me eat chicken, I can tell that you know what you're doing. There were two people on the table who got the steak - of whom one returned it, and I can swear I saw the other, sneaking a lick off the plate. The other knows her steak, so I'd say it was good meat. The scallops were delicious and soul cleansing, but at \u00a330, and with an empty stomach, it might be something of a hard sell. If you're on a date with a millionaire, however, go ahead and order two of those babies.Skip the dessert. Go pick up an ice cream tub from your local Waitrose.",

I have no idea why in hindsight, but I chose the crispy and crunchy salad with cashews and apricot dressing (\u00a37.20 - take note of the price). I wanted something light, and nothing else on the menu appealed to me, so I went for the salad. What I got I would describe as more of a slaw...shredded carrots, shredded cucumber, shredded beetroot, shredded lettuce. Rabbit food. Portion was big, dressing was already slathered all over my salad, and it was quite unmanageable to eat.My main was a \u00a316 steak tartare. I'm a huge steak tartare fan (best ones I've ever had were in Paris and Berlin), and I still can't find a place in London that blows me over. Do let me know if you know of any. The tartare arrived and there was a subtle greyish tinge that worried me...matter of freshness and all. I tasted it, it was fine, but stodgy and really unappealing. It came with these melba toast 'breads' to go with the steak tartare which didn't help. I wanted some nice chips, fries, something substantial to go with it!\u00a325+ for rabbit food and stodgy tartare. Service was slow, bill took ages to arrive, and I spotted a fly that kept hovering around the table. Not to mention we stood around for 10 minutes waiting for them to grab our coats. Left Villandry stuffed to the brim, but not in a good way at all.",

Okay okay I did have fun and it was more chillaxed in the \"cafe\" area that we ate in but seriously, still silly priced. Apparently if you get a tastelondon.com card you can get 50% off here so that's what we did and lunch for 2 came to \u00a320, great value for money.",

Particularly the main dish (Turkey), which should have been the highlight. The turkey turned out really dry and the the meat looked slightly dull. The meat portions were huge, but some of the sections were slightly cold. Surprising.The starters and desserts were good though. Ordered the shrimp cocktail and chocolate mousse. Those were probably the best two things aside from the main course. Shame.I should have gone for the halibut instead. My friend ordered that and was surprised how tiny the portions were, but apparently it tasted extremely good. Overall, I wouldn't say it was a horrible experience, but I was quite disappointed with how the turkey turned out. I guess it's a give and take. Still having mixed feelings about this place.",

The crowd is beautiful, and for those that are into Instagram, this place and the food is definitely Insta-worthy.Service is excellent. Our waiter was friendly and food came out fairly quickly.Food is excellent too, although portions aren't very large.-- Poached eggs on top of avocado and sourdough is delicious. I know this particular dish isn't exactly difficult, and even I could probably replicate it, but somehow it was just perfect. I highly recommend it.-- Chicken sandwich - Husband didn't like the focaccia but he did love the chicken. (There was too much bread for the size of the filling I think.)-- Sweet potato fries/chips were amazing. Not greasy, with a ton of salt - just the way I love them.-- Tomato salad was nothing special - I wouldn't order this again.-- Chocolate souffle cake with salted caramel ice cream. I didn't try this but my husband devoured it. Which is a great sign.Overall we really enjoyed our lunch and I'd return in an instant. I 100% recommend giving Villandry a try.",

Three of them were plentiful and at GBP 15.00, it was definitely a bargain.

Nonetheless, great range of reasonably priced, fabulous food (breakfast, salads, pizzas, main courses, desserts)...BUT service was slow. We had gone for a late lunch, by the time the place was emptying out. \u00a0The waiter who served us seemed distant, making it a little awkward to summon his attention. Altogether, a prominent place which I will be happy to try & visit again.",

    "text": "It was close to the hotel, seemed promising, and I was in a mood to judge a book by its cover so I let my hunger pangs and the Frenchy-sounding name make the decision for me. \u00a0Mistake #1.After taking an initial look around the attached market and noting that the take-out selection kind of sucks, I gave up and decided to have breakfast on premises. \u00a0Mistake #2.Chose the most innocuous looking item on the menu, which was the yogurt, banana, muesli concoction. \u00a0Mistake #3.It got worse as the dish came in what looked like an old-fashioned soda fountain-looking cup. \u00a0It was impossible to mix the ingredients together - the banana came in a different smallish condiment bowl - and given the weird shape of the cup I kept spraying muesli all over the table like some spastic American tourist (oh shit, wait...). \u00a0On top of this they fuc*ed up the yogurt to muesli ratio (not enough yogurt) and hence it was super dry - after a while I gave up as it felt like I was munching on tree bark.Oh well, I'm sure the other items on the menu are just perfectly fine. \u00a0It's not like the service is excruciatingly slow even when there's 3-4 wait staff hanging around the dining area catering to less than 10 diners...oh no, not at all. \u00a0I ended up going to the Pret down the street for breakfast.",

    "text": "Villandry is a warm breakfast place in a very convenient location in the area. Their menu is simple, more simple than I initially thought, and they have tons of fresh baked goods. My friend ordered a bacon sandwich and I ordered an English muffin and a croissant. We were surprised to find the bacon sandwich was literally ONLY a few cooked strips of bacon between two pieces of white bread. I couldn't believe it. It was good, though.This is one of the more awkward dining experiences I've had. My waiter was simply an awkward person and we never knew what to do next. He staggered the delivery of our food in a weird way. He gave me my English muffin first. Then he brought our drinks. Then after I finished my English muffin he brought my friend's sandwich. At that point I thought he had forgotten about my croissant order but to my surprise he brought it well after my friend had finished his sandwich already.I asked him for the check a few times and he never heard me, until he eventually brought it later.The English muffin itself was extremely good. Though a small portion, it was one of the best I've ever had. As was the buttery croissant which melted in my mouth. The prices, however, were a bit excessive and the whole experience didn't seem worth it.",

    "text": "What: The VillandryWhere: Portland StValue: \u00a335ppFood Review: When choosing from the menu, the options were limited. The specials consisted of half a lobster or a whole, upon which I ordered whole, and am glad I did. The lobster was not very meaty and came with either a small portion of salad or chips. This was quite expensive and was not worth it. The cocktail was pretty good, refreshing and fruity.The dessert also redeemed the meal, although it was shared, it could have been for one. Settings Review: Upon entrance, we were given a variety of dining arrangements with comfortable seating. The room was dimly lit which made this hard to see the special board which was tucked away in the corner. Apart from this, the room was created for a cosy, warm, relaxing evening. Positives: great ambienceNegatives: overpriced3 word reviews: expensive, british, ambience",

I've sat here catching up with friends for hours and the staff have been really accommodating. Inside is really spacious and it's never been really loud or crowded on of the occasions that I've been here. I've had lunch and dinner here as well and that is expensive but its convenient so can't complain. It's a nice place for a date and the location is great!",

Friend got a scone with clotted cream and loved it, so maybe just bad luck on my part. Regardless, takeaway breakfast here is amazing.",
