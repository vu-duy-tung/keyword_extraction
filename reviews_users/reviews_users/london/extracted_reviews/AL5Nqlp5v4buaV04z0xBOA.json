    "text": "If you are familiar with L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, I'll highlight the main differences with the Paris rue du Bac mother-ship.It's not just sitting at the counter around a plancha kitchen. They have a few small tables, and a bar/lounge. Which means that :1) they take reservations.2) you can wait in the lounge if no place is free!For those who do not know Robuchon:He is the most renowned French chef from the past quarter century. No less. You will not get very rich French classical cuisine. (and definitely not the over-creamy rendition offered to foreigners all over the world). But modern French cuisine at its best. You will be blown away.For those not familiar with L'Atelier :Similar restaurants been opened in Vegas, Hong-Kong, Taiwan and Tokyo. This is not the flagship 'High-cuisine' Robuchon restaurant ('La Table de Joel Robuchon', Michelin 3 stars), but a more convivial, less formal setting. \u00a0The Paris restaurant does not take reservations, for example... this one does.... You will still get a very refined and modern take on some French and international classics. A bit like tapas, you get to choose between small 'bites' and larger dishes. Mix and match, as much as you like / can afford.The menus range from the 27 quids 'pre-theatre' offer to the gigantic menu Decouverte. The pre-theatre formula (27 quids) is definitely the best quality/price ratio food you're ever likely to get.My advice is simple. GO! \u00a0If you can't get a seat right away, WAIT !BUT. WHATEVER YOU DO. DO GET THE MASHED POTATOES.",

    "text": "I don't know what it takes to get three Michelin stars, but i believe this restaurant has done everything except bribe someone. \u00a0I ate here on Christmas Eve, and it was one of the few restaurants in London that wasn't doing a set menu, and I was glad they weren't.The restaurant itself is beautiful with a very unique setup on the lower level. \u00a0It has the appearance of a high end sushi bar, but with a warmth that you don't generally find in Japanese restaurants. \u00a0The majority of the seating is at the bar with a few scattered tables throughout the downstairs. \u00a0I believe the upper levels are all table seating. \u00a0I would recommend sitting at the bar. \u00a0It is a unique setting.There is an open kitchen that is actually inside of the seated bar, but separated by a small run in which the waiters and sommelier's pour drinks, take your order, and expedite your food. \u00a0Essentially, you still see the Chef's working, but you get a real waiter. \u00a0The service was spectacular.This was one of the largest wine lists I have ever seen for a small restaurant. \u00a0They must have somewhere between 200 to 250 wines available by the bottle. \u00a0They have both red and white wines from every major wine region in the world, but (of course-Joel Robuchon) the majority is made up of French wines. \u00a0I am not very well versed in French wines so I requested the assistance of the sommelier. \u00a0I gave her a very short description of what I like and she immediately pointed us to a 2008 Sancere that was a perfect choice.The first dish was a black truffle and endive salad followed by a scallop carpaccio in lemon oil. \u00a0Both were amazing. \u00a0The next was a pumpkin soup, it was my least favorite. \u00a0I want to be very clear in saying \"least favorite\" as opposed to \"worst\" because even being my least favorite; had this dish been served in 98% of the other restaurants I frequent it would have been the best dish. \u00a0We followed with a lobester ravioli with savoy cabbage and a foie gras reduction, which was flawless. \u00a0Finally, we had black cod with a cauliflower puree (it was the tits)..No flaws to be found anywhere in the service, atmosphere, or food. \u00a0 We ate at \"Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's\" the previous evening. \u00a0That restaurant was good, but not great. \u00a0It was what happens when a really great chef is no longer in the kitchen; some laziness in the dishes. \u00a0The best dishes at Ramsay's were the off menu amus bouche and pre-desert. \u00a0IThis had me greatly concerned when we went to Joel Robuchon's the next night. \u00a0I thought: \"Well he isn't going to be in the kitchen so the food may be suspect.\" \u00a0That couldn't be father from accurate. \u00a0Amazing food, kudos and my highest compliments to the staff, both kitchen and floor.",

They did and we felt like royalty (funny we were in London). The restaurant is gorgeous. The Mondrian inspired wall art with spices is original. The wall of ivy (?) cascading down brings life and color into the dark room. But the clear vases displaying vegetables above the kitchen radiate with carrot rings, perfectly green fennel, orange bell peppers. I'm sure the menu changes frequently. However the best part of our meal was the unexpected vegetables that accompanied our main courses. It was a bowl of cooked radishes napped in butter and the slightest hint of vanilla. After endless meals of meat/potatoes in England these vegetables made me so happy. After our entrees they invited us upstairs to the lounge to have our desserts. They went out of their way to provide the pregnant wife with enough pillows to support her back. Definitely would return!",

    "text": "L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon is one of my treats to myself when I'm in the mood for a wonderful gastronomic experience in London. It is a short walk from Leicester Square or Covent Garden tube stations.I can see what other reviewers mean when they say that there is a bit of pretension here (Michelin star, etc) but I've never experienced anything but courteous and meticulous service when I come here - and once *gasp* without a reservation!The best deals here are the lunch specials and the pre-theatre menu. I prefer to come for lunch since it is more relaxed. The food is always beautifully presented, absolutely delicious and very creative. My cousin, who detests fish dishes, will come to L'Atelier and devour their fish courses without complaint and even want more! I like to order a cappuccino after my meal, but I must admit that it's more for the accompanying house-made caramel than for the coffee itself. My one tiny complaint is that something in the L'Atelier restaurant seems to irritate my eyes - they get very dry and itchy. I'm not sure if it's the proximity to the open kitchen (onion fumes?), the lighting or some combination of both. I don't have this up in La Cuisine (or when I leave and step outside into natural light). Odd, isn't it? Ah, but I will suffer itchy eyes for the delicious food here!",

    "text": "My approach to restaurants that are SORT OF A BIG DEAL has always been to feign ignorance and not let my inner fangurl get the best of me. However, this was the second L'Atelier I've been to, though it must be said that the first was in Las Vegas so I'm not sure if the two experiences are even comparable. I arrived for lunch with a mid-sized group on a rainy afternoon and we were immediately seated (not too busy for a weekday). They were offering a type of set lunch with several courses, which all of us opted in for and turned out to be a great decision. After being well-oiled with several bottles of wine (though our server was rather stingy on the pours), we began feeeeeding. The bread basket (as expected) was amazing and contained a variety of bread choices. I'm a bit of a carb-hound so I was obviously delighted. The food was very rich and cream-based, which I guess is to be expected, and the portions (though moderate) pack a punch. Let's just say I was not hungry for the rest of MY LIFE/day. As others have mentioned before, the highlight may have been their mashed potatoes, which we all agreed were 90% butter and 10% potato. Either way, it was a decadent party in my mouth. I'm refraining from a five-star review because the service was rather lackluster. Though our group occupied two tables side-by-side, we had different servers and the other table's server was noticeably more attentive and GENEROUS WITH THE WINE POURS (yes, I am apparently fixated on this point). The venue was obviously decorated by the same quirky set designer behind Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain (yeah wrap your head around THAT for a minute). What this means in reality is actually kind of hard to articulate but silly to witness so perhaps you should save yourself the Google image search and see for yourself.",

    "text": "L'Atelier is a must do for a great dining experience. \u00a0Searched through Yelp reviews and stumbled upon L'Atelier. Sounded fab and used the online booking tool to make a reservation. Unless you book far in advance, you're kind of stuck with either 1700 or 2100. Ah, what the hell...I'll do my workout and hit the restaurant at 2100--earn that decadent food! Since I was a table of one, they seated me at the bar which was fine with me though it is a tad cramped. \u00a0You're almost sitting in the lap of the person next to you. \u00a0One of my few recommendations would be to take a \u00a0couple of chairs out and give folks a tad more room. \u00a0The guy next to me elbowed me a couple of times. \u00a0BUT, you get this awesome view into the kitchen. \u00a0The service is very attentive as the variety of folks working behind the bar continually check on you. \u00a0Great looking wait staff also.The food is simply amazing. \u00a0For a starter, I had a crab tourteau (15 pounds) that was crab meat with a blood orange topping. \u00a0For the main, I chose the lamb loin special of the day (34 pounds) which was a nice thick slice of perfectly cooked lamb loin. \u00a0While sitting there admiring the kitchen operation, I spotted this animal leg perched in a silver holder. \u00a0After inquiring from the hostess, found out that it was Iberian ham...YES PLEASE. \u00a0The sommelier recommended this flight of wonderful sherries. \u00a0Of course, something like that is going to set you back some coins...37 pounds to be exact...but well worth the experience as you just can't get Iberian ham in the States and our sherry selections tend to be crap. \u00a0So...all totaled, four courses, wine pairings with each and a cocktail to start off the madness...175 pounds. \u00a0You only live once!!!",

Three courses for \u00a327 at a Michelin starred place, courtesy of the 'chef of the century' doesn't sound too shabby to me.We arrived a little early and had a drink at the salon bar upstairs. Just next to The Ivy, the place is hard to miss, but is surprising once you step instead. Any preconceptions about the kind of decor French cuisine might be served in are slashed immediately. L'Atelier is decked out in Oriental black and red, with the hostess & waiter's uniforms and beautiful Japanse plants to match.The drinks upstairs were nice - the bar was nothing special, but empty and relaxing all the same.Lovely service throughout dinner - as expected - and very tasty food. I had a country terrine with fresh bread, pickled mushrooms and redcurrant chutney, followed by haddock and mussels with pasta and a shelfish sauce. I finished off with a chocolate sorbet with mousse with a Oreo cookie crumb.All very nice, but nothing that made me go 'wow'. I think my Mum picked the better dishes as she made yummy noises throughout eating. We had a nice bottle of white, but it was pricey at \u00a338. I liked being able to see directly into the kitchen, and the chef's bar looked fun. I'd definitely go back to try the tasting plates, but I can't say it lived up to the over-hyped expectations.",

When we were sat at the bar, I was expecting the worst (I always find it awkward to sit at a bar - I feel it can be less personal and I hate people watching me eat...) but I need not have feared! We had the best seats in the house, since the kitchen is open plan - we got to watch all the food being prepared and really made us appreciate it more! This food is definitely an art form... I've never seen anyone select the right tips of some dill to place on a place before, nor have I ever seen anyone put tiny cubes of smoked salmon on a place using a pair of tweezers to get it in the right place...). \u00a0Sitting at the bar reminded me of sitting in a sushi bar in Tokyo, watching the chef make my sushi... The food blew me away - it looked amazing on the plate (almost too pretty to eat... almost) and tasted really good. \u00a0We had some tasting plates to share - my favourite was the crab wrapped in spicy turnip and the scallop carpaccio. \u00a0Definitely leave room for dessert! I'm amazed how full it was, just for lunchtime on a weekday... but totally worth it! The staff are great - they explain all of the specials, memorise your order and have fabulous accents (I'm still working out whether the accents were genuine or not...!). \u00a0My favourite thing about the whole visit is the apple theme - giant apples placed strategically around the restaurant, very juicy looking apples displayed in a bowl... is it any wonder that when asked what I would like to drink, I said apple juice?! Overall, we had a wonderful time and it's a fab place for a special treat! Give it a try! You know you want to!",

    "text": "This is one of the 3 Joel Rubuchon's I've eaten at, and it's definitely a very good place to try. Actually, it's probably my favorite restaurant in London! However, I should point out that compared to the locations in Paris and New York, I found this branch to be slightly behind, quality wise.For my meal, I had the the beef carpaccio, the langoustine ravoili, and the beef and foie gras burger with caramelized onions. The carpaccio was scrumptious, lovely cuts of meat simply complimented with gorgeously flavored olive oil, garlic and chives. The langoustine ravioli was very good, but it didn't blow me away. I could barely taste the langoustine and the portion was so tiny I didn't get much of a second chance to try and search for more flavor! Finally, the burger was good, but a bit of a disappointment. The flavor of the the foir gras was outstanding, but the beef was a bit non-descript, and overall, as a concept, it just didn't work for me. They also gave me an \"order\" of fries, that had about 4 fries in it. I realize you go to a Joel Robuchon for the taste not portion size, but c'mon! Four f****** fries?Finally, I just want to note that our waiter (or whatever you call the guys within the Atelier) was a bit obnoxious when talking to us, quite a contrast to the other Joel Robuchon's we dined at where they exude professionalism. I wish I got his name, but since I didn't Ill just say that the guy was coarse and made a few inappropriate jokes which I felt had no place in this type of environment.Overall, definitely four stars, but surprisingly, not five due to slightly disappointing food and an oaf of a waiter. Still worth a visit!",

Holy molecular gastronomy, these guys know every trick. I loved every dish of the tasting menu, which was more dishes than I can count. I'm usually pretty picky and not a seafood fan but I tried and loved them all. The dessert was insane, melting right in front of you as liquid nitrogen gets poured over chocolate to reveal the surprise inside.. I won't ruin it for you but do try it for yourself.

    "text": "Despite 3 fruitful years in high school French and numerous attempts by my 18-year-old-self to trick people into believing I was French, I didn't have an effing clue what \"L'Atelier\" meant. Even upon entering the interior of the sleek restaurant with Asian-inspired decor, I still had no clue. Let's face it, I googled it just before I began this review. According to the free dictionary (yes, had to use the free one because it turns out places with apostrophes in the name are as expensive as they sound), L'atelier means \"A workshop or studio, especially for an artist or designer.\" It all fell into place when I read that... Words to describe our experience and the food at L'Atelier: Superb, fabulous, wonderful, delicious, beautiful, surprising, gorgeous, yes-I'll-have-a-dessert-even-though-I'm-full-and-will-be-late-to-my-west-end-show-licious. First off, the service was wonderful. Not stuffy or overly formal, but friendly and extremely professional. I do think the Frenchman delivering our food may have amped up his accent just a bit to play the part of the French waiter, or it could be that in contrast to my ridiculously English boyfriend, it stood out. Disclaimer: The sommelier was also helpful and accommodating with regard to the price range we felt comfortable with. The food...scratch that. The Food (yes, it has to be considered a proper noun - it's that good) was spectacular. We began with a rich amuse bouche and a basket of 3 types of wonderful bread - traditional baguette, savoury olive bread and a sweet fig bread. If I could have bought a loaf of each to take home, I would have. We opted for 4 courses. I went a little egg crazy and got a cheese souffl\u00e9, followed by a crispy poached egg served atop parmesan mousse. A CRISPY poached egg! How does that even happen? I was sitting there while they made it in the open kitchen and I still have no idea what frankenstein science was used! All I know is that I want it to happen over and over again. I had duck for the main and it was every bit as delicious as I could have hoped. This is where my only criticism comes though - the orange sauce that came with the duck was far too sweet for my taste and reminded me of a melted down hard candy. I just ate around it and enjoyed the duck in a slightly purer form. I was, however, reminded of the time when my dad was making a \"new recipe\" which was \"orange chicken\" and when we didn't have real orange juice, he used Sunny Delight instead. We ended up eating pizza that night. My boyfriend was equally as happy with his dishes - a lobster salad with a very generous portion of lobster, a shitake chicken broth and a 'spit roast of the day,' which happened to be lamb and (surprise) happened to be delicious! We were also given a complimentary pot of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes either of us had ever had. Despite running short of time, we decided to squeeze in dessert because, well, we are greedy, disgusting gluttons but it somehow seems more acceptable when it's not burgers and nachos... We had the same - chocolate fondant with a mint sorbet. No points for creativity here, but from the first bite it was obvious this had been perfected and shouldn't be messed with. The really outstanding thing about this restaurant is that they so artfully prepared ingredients, we each enjoyed things we otherwise wouldn't have touched with a 10 foot pole. Case in point: My boyfriend hates eggs so much that I had to get a hysterectomy (ok, not that much but you know...). He ate and ENJOYED the savoury cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e amuse bouche. (*sorry Ed, you ate eggs. I didn't want you to spit your food up at this civilised establishment so didn't tell you). \u00a0I hate sea creatures and am actually scared of them. This probably all goes back to when I got sea lice as a kid but that's another story for another time. I ate a piece of lobster and didn't even flinch! Neither of us particularly like olives, we pounded all the olive bread like it was the last bread on the planet. L'Atelier is one of the best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. It's clear that there is a real passion for food, art and creativity here. It's front of house is well managed and they even walked us down the street to get us going the right direction to the show we were attending. It's not cheap and it's not everyday fare, but it's worth every penny and great for a special occasion or a good ol' fashioned splurge. I'll be saving up my burger and nacho money from now on and putting it in the L'Atelier fund!",

The food was excellent and I don't regret the fact I chose to go there to eat something delicious. Even if a bit pricy for what it was.Unfortunately, the service was not what I was expecting for.They have \"bar\" tables in front of the open kitchen and room tables, they didn't ask about our preference but just \"your seats are here\". If some people enjoy to see guys cooking food, I definitely don't recommend it as it quickly becomes really hot and all what you want to do is to leave the restaurant.You can hear \"Service, s'il vous plait\" a large amount of time during your dinner, each time a plate has to be served. I don't know if it's to add something to the \"show\", but that's a way too much, and the french food doesn't require it.Other than that, you can expect to have good time there. Again, the food was amazing :)",

    "text": "I had my Graduation meal there last night with my parents and my partner and I can't even find words to describe how amazing it all was. Firstly the cocktail list is very intelligently put together and I had an apple sour that had a shot glass full of Moscato Jelly! The textures and the sweetness offset the sourness of the apple cocktail beautifully. It was so clean and refreshing on the palate and very well mixed so there wasn't such an alcoholic back draft after each sip. The Rooftop bar too made all the difference especially in this hot, sultry weather. It was tranquil up there as well as nice and cool. L'Atelier is seriously one sexy place in terms of decor as well as everything else. If you want to take someone here to impress them then this would be a sure fire way. From the moment you enter the doors to the moment you are seated, the place seems to do a good job in seducing you in every single way. The food is a great concept too. We opted not to have the tasting menu on account that there was a bit too much Foie Gras in it (3 dishes had it in there) and we wanted to sample the other things a little more. My only criticism is that I felt that the tasting menu lacked imagination to provide 3 dishes with Foie Gras and before anyone states the obvious, I know it is a French restaurant in essence! That aside I felt between us we all chose well. We had a crab guacamole which was delicate and very beautifully presented, scallops and squid that were cooked to absolute perfection - I have never had squid melt so gently in my mouth. If this was to be a food erotica gastronomical moment then I would have sent my taste buds to Coco De Mer to be whipped, teased and tingled to a culinary orgasmic afterglow. There was another scallop dish too which had a baby leek, caviar, gently seasoned seared scallop and a lovely buttery lemon sauce that was like eating a slightly savory equivalent of something like lemon curd. It was delicate and gentle but gently cleansed the palate against the salty caviar. I could have eaten that dish a million times over. We tried the little hamburgers that had some foie gras and to go with that we had a lovely bottle of Pomerol. It is my absolute favorite red wine ever and it was so smooth it would have given James Bond a run for his money. For our mains we had Black Cod that was divine, some Veal that was beaten and topped with a salad and the veal was so good and so vegetarian friendly that it was more than suitable as a veggie option for one of our open minded members of our party. We were also served a delightful pot of mash that was so velvety and rich we literally found ourselves licking the pot clean. The french really know how to make potatoes taste good! We also had cheese, which was nicely ordered and slightly strong that was accompanied by some rather divine walnut bread. But for me the Chocolate Profiterole with vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell was the most amazing dessert ever. They poured chocolate over a chocolate shell which made the sauce that covered the profiterole and to say it was fantastic would be a complete understatement of the century. I rarely eat chocolate desserts either but this is going down as the best one I have eaten ever! There was also a yuzu mousse that was zingy and that was accompanied by a raspberry sorbet as well as a rum baba and meringue sphere that was accompanied by a 'multivitamin' sorbet which I suppose was there to make the diner feel a sense of some health after consuming the delicious calories offered. But saying that when you go for a dining experience like that it is about the food and the calorie counts will go out of the window. I would definitely go back again and it was certainly a graduation to remember!",

    "text": "Jo\u00ebl Robuchon is kind of a big deal, as he's pretty much the most well-respected chef of his generation and was named \"Chef of the Century.\" He's got restaurants all over the world, most of which have one or two Michelin stars. The two-starred London location is right by Piccadilly Circus, and upon arriving for my 1:30 pm seating, I took a seat at the bar, which is set right in front of the open kitchen. After placing my orders for the \u00a328, three-course lunch prix fixe menu, I was served an amuse bouche, which is another thing about fine dining that appeals to my inner cheapass (more food!). Consisting of a spoonful of a potato-fish pur\u00e9e, the amuse bouche tasted very much like a white fish spread, and it was a tasty first bite. Served a bread basket consisting of white, wheat, and olive breads, I found myself going back for the olive bread again and again. I must have gone through four or five pieces of the olive bread before my meal was done; that's how good it was. And also because, well, unlimited bread!For my first course, I went with what the waitress described as one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Described as \"Egg cocotte topped with light wild mushrooms cream,\" this dish was mind-blowingly good, and it's no wonder that it is a signature dish. A soft-poached egg nestled in a bath of creamy soup along with mushrooms and asparagus slivers, this was the highlight of the meal and had me using bread to sop up every last drop of soup.My entr\u00e9e, described as \"Razor clams fricassee with confit tomatoes, sweet onion, and macaroni,\" (pictured at top) was like a refined version of a pasta dish that you'd find at The Cheesecake Factory. I don't say that to slight the dish, but it just wasn't as creative or elaborate as the other courses I enjoyed. The creamy sauce actually tasted very similar to a vodka sauce, and the razor clams were cooked nicely. While I usually am not a huge fan of cilantro, I found the cilantro-bread crumb mixture on the razor clam shell to be quite refreshing.For dessert, I ordered the \"Fresh strawberry and pistachio cream cake with mascarpone ice cream.\" The beautifully-presented dish was just as appealing to the taste buds as to the eyes, as the moist interior of pistachio cake was really quite tasty, especially when paired with the fresh strawberries and sweet ice cream. I wasn't particularly crazy about the outer pastry layer, which I found to be a bit tough, but everything else about the dessert was superb.Walking away from my meal at L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, I can say that I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service, which was friendly and helpful throughout the lunch. Okay, so perhaps the restaurant would be better served by not applying foam to nearly every dish, and \u00a328, or about $45, is definitely close to the maximum amount for how much I'd be willing to pay for a three-course lunch prix fixe, but all in all, I was quite pleased with my lunch. Whereas Restaurant Week prix fixes tend to be disappointing and underwhelming, year-round prix fixe deals at restaurants like L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon mean that there's no need to fight the crowds and muck your way through mediocre food. Overall, this is a good-value prix fixe that gets my recommendation.",

    "text": "There is really only one experience from my first year in London that is worthy of my 100th review. \u00a0We went to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon back in March when we were first getting our feet wet in the London food scene. \u00a0Of course, I've been writing and rewriting the review, and it's been sitting unfinished in my account for nearly a year now--what can I say, I have an amazing talent for procrastination. \u00a0I wasn't sure (am still not sure) that I can do our experience the justice it deserves. \u00a0So, without further ado... my best London food experience of 2010.The hubs and I made a pact that our time in London is going to be one of great experiences. \u00a0Chalk the first one up for Mr. Robuchon, one of the greatest culinary minds in the world. \u00a0We went to London's L'Atelier for my birthday in March. My husand has been to the one in Tokyo several times, and absolutely adores it. \u00a0We were seated near the far end of the sleek and sexy bar on the ground floor. \u00a0I was a little perturbed that we hadn't been seated in the empty seats smack in the middle of all the action. \u00a0My mind was quickly changed.Nearly every seat at the bar has an amazing view into the kitchen. \u00a0Sitting to my right was a very well dressed Frenchman chatting it up with the sommelier. \u00a0Next came another European couple that took the two seats next to my husband. \u00a0Both impeccably dressed... the girl about twenty and the man somewhere in his late-40's. \u00a0Of course, I suspected the worst. \u00a0But after a couple glasses of champagne, we discovered that they were actually father and daughter, and the guy was Robuchon's business partner. \u00a0At which point, Robuchon made an appearance from the rear of the kitchen. He chatted with us for a few minutes. We mainly discussed the amazingness of the Chicago dining scene (he's tried repeatedly to open a place in Chicago to no avail--please keep trying! is all I have to say to that).At this point, the evening becomes a fairly booze-fueled, and rather surreal experience. \u00a0We started the meal with the menu decouverte with the wine pairings. \u00a0This, however, was derailed after a few courses, because having made friends with the Monegasque father-daughter pair and the impeccably dressed Frenchman, who turned out to be one of Robuchon's most regular customers on the face of the planet--hey, if I could afford it, I'd make this place my own personal Cheers, too!--suggestions on what to try were made. \u00a0And wow, best, recommendations, ever! We ate rounds of butter-laden mashed potatoes and wondefully divine truffle dishes. The Frenchman was our ticket into samples of amazing, 20-year-old, first-growths served by the awesome Bulgarian sommelier. Of course, then he introduced me to \"Francois' Yuzu Souffle\". There really is nothing sexier than a Frenchman talking about souffles. And of course, Robuchon's pastry chef, Francois is a super crazy diva--a man diva, but a diva nonetheless. The man wears sunglasses in the restaurant and hits on the gorgeous women sitting at the bar in his spare time. Like I said, man diva. Anyway, it was one of the best things I have ever consumed. Done so perfectly, it was absolutely incredible. I cannot even do it justice talking about it. You'll just have to try it for yourself. By the end of the evening we had an open invitation to hang out in Monaco; a Polaroid with Joel Robuchon, that my husband proudly displays on his desk at work; and a bill that could have been far worse than it was (it was still the most expensive meal I've ever eaten). It was hands-down the best dining experience I've had in London so far. And while I can't promise anyone else the same experience, it is still my favorite fine dining restaurant in London, and my first recommendation to out-of-towners looking for a great experience. Robuchon is one of those chefs who wants his diners to love food as much as he does. And that in in itself is what makes this place so brilliant.",

BEST sliders/burgers i've ever had! the bun was soft/fluffy, and every bite had the perfect amount of beef & foie gras.",

The decor is sexy and exciting - lots of red leather and dark woods, with an Asian-influenced feel. It's dark, atmospheric space and there's quiet, unobtrusive music playing. The service (I disagree with the previous reviewer) was excellent - they staff were attentive, polite and helpful. We sat at the bar on the ground floor and enjoyed the delicious pre-theatre menu (we had 3 wonderful courses in about an hour). The set price (chose between 2 or 3 courses) includes a half bottle of mineral water and your choice of tea or coffee: this was a nice touch. With a glass of fine wine each we paid a shade over 50 pounds each. The seats at the bar let you enjoy the 'pre-theatre' of watching the mise en place of the various dishes currently under preparation. Waiters were unobtrusive but happy to explain what was going on and describe whatever we could see being cooked. We are certainly going to return for the seven course tastings menu. The food, even for the pre-theatre menu, was exquisite and innovative. The portions small but not mean. Try it - you wont be disappointed.",

We arrived 30 mins late due to the heavy traffic around leiceston square but was lucky they honored our reservation. We opted out of the tasting dinner as every dish has foie gras and we felt it could be an overkill. We were seated at the bar and that actually makes it more efficient to get waiter's attention and check out other diners' food. I ordered the lamb cutlet and crab dumplins for appetizer and they were done to perfection. the lamb cutlet is more like lamb chop and well seasoned. We saw the diners next to me were presented with a cocktail glass and we thought it was white russion at first. Turns out it was an appetitzer dish with mushroom mousse and egg and we had to order that. It was ridiculously good. My main dish is the scottish lobster and it was probably one of the best lobster dish I had anywhere. The souffle dessert didn't disappoint and dinner ended on a perfect high note.",

    "text": "I feel bad giving l'atelier 3 stars because I really thought this would be a no-brainer 5 stars! All the other Qypers tend to agree, even Michelin agrees But it didn't quite work for us and the experience was overall disappointing because we had such great expectations. On the plus sides the service, very pro and friendly, mainly French but not only, not too formal, and also the design of the place which has its own strong style, kind of modern opulent classic style, quite busy but with strong personnality (very red and Asian downstairs, more black and white kitchen upstairs). Th equality of the design is excellent so the setting is not to be blamed. But unfortunately the food was not so great considering that you have to expect to pay around \u00a3100 per head for dinner (assuming you keep the wine under control). First of all the menu is quite short with maybe eight starters and eight main courses. The starters were the worst part with fried frog legs which were tasting like fish fingers (so fried that it could have been anything really) and a crab with avocado where the crab didnt taste anything special so it could have read Guacamole with crab really. The main courses were good but the portions very small. We passed on the cheese but maybe we should have gone for it as I would have left more full. So the London edition of l'Atelier didnt quite work but if we can we will try the Paris one as it might have been a low energy day for the chef. Maybe also this is because we were upstairs rather than downstairs where the format is more like sitting at the bar rather than at a table (even if we had booked at 9pm we were told that they would be late and that we would have to wait at the bar at least 30mn or go upstairs so we did).",

Personally I was not comfortable with the interior design and the slightly exposed feeling I got with my particular place. Staff were quite professional but somehow distant. It's a tricky thing at this price level and perhaps they are too busy to pull off the 'welcome back' that you get even on infrequent dining at some better places. The food was well above average and certainly qualified for more than one Michelin star, though in the couple of months since I was there memory of particular dishes has faded. As I did not choose the wines either, I can only comment that they were good without being truly outstanding but of course they may well have just been not my style. The whole experience did not create that 'must return' feeling, but it was sufficiently good that a return match must be arranged.",

    "text": "It has been a while since I went here, but I might as well review it as I know I will never be back. On the surface level, this restaurant has many many things going for it. The decor is opulent and has this expensive aura oozing from it. (Though I do agree with the other review that it does resemble a giant bento box) The food, is actually very remarkable. Like tiny mouthfuls of perfection. I distinctly remember the clams, with their garlicky cheezy goodness. Only I also remember that we only got 5. That's five clams, the size of a toffee penny. I ordered the langoustine, it was presented beautifully on a stick. One langoustine. For about \u00a310. It was delicious, but I had to share it. \u00a35 for the perfect mouthful of battered prawn. I remember the waiter (very polite) explaining the menu. There were different portion sizes, so we ordered 2 or 3 of each size thinking it would be enough. The food turned up, the largest actually being the equivalent of what I'd expect from a starter - only it cost more than what I would normally pay for a main. The smallest left me wondering if I was going to have to go to Mcdonalds afterwards. I am no stranger to fine dining and have no qualms about paying for quality food but there is a line to be drawn. However famous Monsieur Robuchon is, or however many Michelin stars he has, does not warrant the eyewatering prices that is served up at the end of a meal here. I paid less for a whole lot more, and I don't just mean the food portions, at a certain 3 michelin star restaurant on Royal Hospital Road. Go here if you will, but make sure that whoever is going to be paying gets to see the menu first..",

    "text": "Regular Tuesday evening at work and a senior colleague declared that we would be doing a 'spontaneous' team dinner after work. I volunteered to organize. Knowing the nature of the people at dinner, I knew I needed to look at the top end of the range - Hakkasan, Galvin Bistrot, sketch, L'Atelier de JR. Amazingly, sketch and this place had seats available - the bosses preferred good food over funky atmosphere, so we settled on L'Atelier. Free team dinner at Michelin restaurant - yes, please! But oh no, I have some medical restrictions for a few months on alcohol, raw food and delicacies like caviar and foie gras - oh so sad (What a strictly upper middle class first world problem :P)We were seated upstairs in a dark gallery with dimmed lighting, stylish decor and a view of the kitchen. We provided plenty of logistical challenges to the restaurant between my dietary constraints and one of the party arriving 45mins late, which upset some of the rhythm of the multi-course menu.After some confusion, we finally placed our orders. The tasting menu comes in 5-/8-courses with two different types of wine pairings (Sommelier's choice vs. French pairings) - we decided to brave the 5-course menu with Sommelier's choice(not for me!)...but as I started reading through the details of the menu, I realised I could have almost none of the courses without replacements, so despite the \"strict\" rules about the entire table ordering the menu, I was allowed by the chef to order off the 'small tasting dishes' menu. The other alternative was to order off the vegetarian tasting menu but frankly, what's the point? After running into foie gras in the most unlikely places, I finally picked 4 small dishes (with dessert to follow!) to keep pace with my colleagues' 5-course menu. A nice balance of veggie, pasta, fish and meat with non-alcoholic drinks.Verdict:1) Spiced Carrot Juice - excellent. Light, gingery, quenches thirst perfectly without overwhelming the palate or weighing me down.2) The amuse bouche with port reduction, egg etc- hmm, oh yes, readied the palate very nicely for a grand meal afterwards3) Slightly smoked aubergine caviar with vegetables and spicy tomato coulis - Tangy and sour from the tomato coulis, just the way I like it, the aubergine was of a smooth texture with crunchy veggies to balance out the creaminess. I like.4) Capellini with tomatoes and a m\u00e9li-m\u00e9lo of crunchy Spring vegetables - a cold dish of stringy pasta in tomato sauce presented pleasingly with a range of veggies. This was certainly the most underwhelming dish of the evening for me. It made me wish I had gone for the lamb, cod or crabmeat instead.5) The Apple Mint Soda took a while to materialise, some chasing was required - I liked the first few sips but soon, it was ghastly in its sweetness and it overpowered my palate and appetite so much that I had to drink water to wash out its flavour before eating6) John Dory fillet on a tomato reduction with avocado vierge sauce - I hadn't had a dory in a long time, so I enjoyed the dish. It was a bit more-ish which is perfectly fine as I was starting to get a bit full. I would venture to say that a tomato reduction is a fairly strong flavour, not always ideal with fish, but this worked. In the future, I'll keep in mind not to order two dishes (aubergine caviar and this) in the same range of flavours - both dominated by the sourness of tomato7) Gyoza of braised veal shank with spinach and harissa - This definitely felt like a 'main'. For one, there are 4 substantially sized gyozas where one might expect 2 or 3. Also, the meat is bursting with flavour and tender, so you can't just inhale it without noticing the quantity. The gyoza was made perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 8) The bread basket was fabulous!Aha, dessert. While the rest had to go with their menu-dictated choice (something boring with raspberry), I could pick from a wide range, and I decided to go for the Warm Guanaja chocolate souffl\u00e9 and Sicilian pistachio ice cream, despite their warnings that it could take 15-20mins. It didn't take that long and oh my gosh, definitely the highlight of the meal! The souffle was the BEST I have had in life. It was light as air, the chocolate was dark and intense, the texture was flawless...I almost didn't notice the pistachio icecream because I couldn't get over the souffle, ooh la la.I noticed my colleagues enjoyed a wide range of wines from various regions, including an unusual Riesling from Luxembourg. So. Why the 4 stars, and not 5? Well, when my dinner costs a small fortune (over 700quid for 4 of us, and I wasn't even drinking), I would like to not feel like I'm inconveniencing the chef through my dietary constraints. If foie gras is merely a garnish in a dash, can they not exclude it? Even chain restaurants are happy to customize so this was unexpected. Service was friendly but a bit confused. Even so, excellent place and quite an experience!",

    "text": "It must be me. Or maybe they were just having an off night. \u00a0I have eaten at amazing restaurants all around the world and people talked about L'Atelier like it was the second coming or something. I thought it was just OK. First of all- there is a ton of pretense. I can be as pretentious as the next person but there was attitude abounding in this place. First the reservation. We called a month in advance and still could only get a 9:30 seating. We got there early and were seated in the upstairs lounge drinking very pricey cocktails until our table was ready around 9:45. A quick note on the lounge as it was quite lovely. \u00a0There is an outdoor area with the walls covered in ivy. \u00a0Inside are several grouped seating areas- one around a large fireplace with leather sofas and chairs. \u00a0We grabbed a corner table relaxing in the club chairs that surrounded it. \u00a0Another nice touch? \u00a0They put down black napkins for your drinks and adorn them with a red rose petal. \u00a0Very classy.Once our reservation was called, because there were 4 of us- we were not seated around the kitchen which is the norm (allows patrons to interact with the chefs)- but got one of the very few tables in the place. This place is small. It gives the illusion of being bigger than it is with mirrors on every wall but I think there may have only been 4 or 5 tables in the whole place. Most of the seating is at the counter where you can see the food being prepared sort of Japanese style. Service was SLOW- slow even by European standards (I get that everyone thinks we Americans are always in a rush but we were hungry!) And our server kept commenting on our choices as if we should be ordering something else. The menu is broken down into two areas- smal tastings on the left facing page and entree sized portions on the right. But don't think you can share the tastings.. These are little tastes. If you want to share- you need to order more than one- and at these prices . . .it adds up fast. We ordered a variety of the tastes: soup, john dory, squid, mini burgers, the salmon (which never came) and the egg cocette. We also ordered the beef tartar from the entree side of the page. While most were good (forget the egg cocette if you want my opinion and order more of the john dory- now that was good!) this was not food I was going to rave to people about. Nor would you be full. Four people split the above and if not for the bread- we would have walked out hungry. But since one in our party had been there before- we had a special treat for dessert. Picture a ball of chocolate (About the size of a softball) filled with fruit and ice cream. At your table- they then pour hot liquid chocolate over it which causes the shell to break apart and reveal what is inside. This was the highlight of my entire dining experience and truly unique. I would have a hard time recommending this place to friends as I think for the money there are better places to eat in London. Those that know me, know that I am not on a budget when I eat out. But I also like to think that the place that I am spending my money wants me as a customer. I didn't get that feeling here at all. And for that . . I doubt I'll be back.",

The starter was an egg in a crispy rice with black truffle and ham - freaking good...The main dish was Le Cabillaud which is a cod fillet with ravioli and vegetables which gives it a special taste... Vegetables were perfectly cooked. Both dishes were amazing!Although, portions were not super-sized as many people got used to, it's worth money. By visiting that restaurant, you'll get an unusual experience and try the best dishes of French kitchen :)",

Of all of them, this is our favorite, because of the intimate size of the downstairs area. It offers arguably the best tasting menu in London, with wine pairings that superbly match each course. The artistry of the food arrangement is really unsurpassed, and it's great fun to watch it being assembled before you, so be sure to ask for a seat at the counter. This makes it easy to chat with the servers and sommelier, making it a friendly, energizing experience. For parties of more than two a few tables are available downstairs, which I recommend over the less intimate upstairs dining room.",

From the beginning to the end, it was definitely a two Michelin star experience. It was actually fairly empty when me and my friend went, so we had 3 people serving out table. They recommended the Riesling from Germany which was lovely. Nice, sweet and refreshing. It suited my tastes perfectly.I ordered the lobster salad, which has fresh lobster (really good, comparable to Newfoundland!), avocado, fried courgette and large mozzarella cheese balls. It also has a green creamy sauce which I would hazard is avocado. This came after a basket of fresh bread, which of course also tastes great when you're hungry. This was followed by an aperitif which was quite interesting. They brought out a free bowl of mashed potatoes which somehow was also really good, rich and creamy. We finished the night with dessert. I ordered the chocolate mousse but I just couldn't finish it. So good but so rich! Definitely get desserts to share! It had this white whipped cream around it which was nice and a little bit lighter to complement the rich dark chocolate mousse and it had a hard chocolate top.Good value for fine dining. Plus, you get a free dessert voucher after your first meal there!",

We were told that there was no ETA on when we could be seated. At this point, we were waiting over an hour to be seated. At 9:30, I was told by a manager that I could sit at the bar on level 1. There were three people in my party. There were empty tables that could accommodate us. How would that work with three people eating dinner at a noisy bar? When I spoke to a very nice manager, he finally seated us at a table. \u00a0Once at the table, it took 20 minutes for someone to come take our order. We ordered basic steaks close to 10pm at night. As time went on, no food was delivered to us. We kept having a manager tell us the food would be here shortly.- \"a few more minutes\". We waited 70 minutes after we ordered but STILL NO FOOD. At this point we had been in the restaurant for close to 3 hours with no food but bread and water. We had ordered coke to drink for the table. That never arrived. We spoke to a very rude and condescending manager who told us to \"be patient\". \u00a0At that point we got up and left. It was 11:30pm.Another manager, told us the food was coming and to go back to the table. He kept saying the kitchen was backed up but the food would be there soon. While we were getting our coats, the hostess was laughing about the situation. \u00a0She then said to my friend \"have a good night, thank you\"We walked out of the restaurant at 11:40pm followed by the manager who basically told us to not come back. I told my hotel, who booked the reservation, to never book there. They will not. Interesting to see that others had similar experiences as well- dating back to 2016.",

We ate on the ground floor in the bar area, a concept begun in 2003 at his left bank St. Germain location in Paris. I highly recommend this as it allows you to watch the precision of the kitchen, \u00a0which you're in full view of, and you can engage more easily with the staff and your neighbors if you so choose. Either before or after dinner make sure you head to the 3rd floor for drinks as an aperitif or post dessert coffee or tea. Beautiful lounge like bar with an outdoor patio area on warm nights. The staff is so great you could have a bad meal and walk out smiling. Of course, having a bad meal here has got to be impossible. We opted for choosing 3 courses each from the starter list/tapas style and portion part of the menu. See my attached pics for mouthwatering crab, langoustine, scallop, girolles (chanterelles), black cod, quail, chocolate souffl\u00e9 and pineapple dishes. Epic meal!",

This is a treat as the price of the drinks are rather on the higher end of the scale. \u00a0Waiter service is attentive without being hassled and drinks served with a decorative little rose petal placed beside it. \u00a0Cocktails are wonderful (but reflected in the price). \u00a0Challenge here is not to drink too much that you forget (or stop caring) about the cost as it can be a pricey visit!However, love it here!",

However, the food wasn't great, and for the money that we paid to eat here, we expected and should have received great. We ordered a range of things from the menu including the foie gras, scallops, miso cod, and lamb. The foie gras was done excellent and so was the lamb. Surprisingly, the best part about the lamb was the mashed potatoes that came with it. Unfortunately, the miso cod was very average and we have had much better. However, the biggest letdown were the scallops. The presentation was beautiful (as it was in every dish), but they smelled and tasted fishy, to the point where we couldn't even finish them. They were also in a very harsh flavored sauce that did not go well with them at all and couldn't even cover up the fishy taste enough to swallow them. I am happy we tried L'Atelier after hearing so much about it, but I highly doubt we would go back after the mediocre experience we had there.",

Right when you walk through the door, you're greeted by a friendly host who gladly checks your winter coat. I came here for lunch yesterday with a friend and we both had an amazing time. The atmosphere is dark, dim, and especially trendy. I loved the back where the wall is covered with tree leaves. We were seated at the bar, which was lovely because you can see everything the chefs are doing. Every dish is carefully crafted and none reach the table unless it looks absolutely perfect. And yes, it tastes as good as it looks.It was lunchtime and a prix-fixe menu is available with a few options at different price points. We opted for the one-starter or dessert and main entree for \u00a328. We both went with starters and a main entree.StartersL'\u0152UF DE POULE - Poached egg in a crispy rice batter served with black truffle &Iberian ham; This was incredibly delicious. My friend said it reminded her of hash browns & breakfast, which isn't a bad thing at all.LE C\u0152UR DE SUCRINE - Heart of lettuce with chicken breast, crispy bacon & parmesan shaving; Very light, but still very tasty. All the elements of a caesar salad, not the most unique dish but still very good nonetheless.MainsLE CABILLAUD - Cod fillet served with flat parsley ravioli and vegetable broth; Very light and flaky but very tasty. The vegetable broth was amazingly flavorful, the fish was steamed cooked to perfects, and the ravioli cover gave it a nice touch.SPECIAL OF THE DAY, PORK FLANK - This isn't on the menu, but it was most definitely the best dish we ordered. The pork was tender and juicy and packed full of flavor. It was one of those dishes that with every bite you take, you roll your eyes back and savor each bite. Yes, it was that AMAZING.Not only did we have an incredible lunch, but to add to the already amazing experience, the service was just as good. I guess I shouldn't be surprised given this restaurant has 2 Michelin stars, but the waitstaff kept bringing us little sides throughout the entire time. Compliments of the chef, we received an amuse bouche to give our tastebuds a teaser, fennel & mashed potatoes as sides for our entree, and a little dessert to end our meal. We spent a good two hours in here and we were never rushed out even though we sat and stewed for a while after our meal was over. I'm a big fan of this restaurant and I'll gladly say that this was one of the best experiences that I've had at a restaurant in London. If you're short on dough and want to experience a culinary experience here, try to come during lunch time when the prix-fixe menus are available.",

But don't be scared, as long as you're not wearing trainers, ripped clothing and paint splotched jeans, the chances are they won't turn you away and leaving your excess luggage in the clock room and you'll be escorted to the top floor cocktail bar!In the same black muted tones, you'll find plush red seating laden with cushions. For those who like the outdoors there is also a outdoor patio that allows you the fresh air that you so seldom find in venues located so centrally.At around \u00a312 a pop for a cocktail, some may find this on the more expensive side, however it's still a reasonably priced night out if you don't expect to binge drink and are happy to nurse your beverage.However beverage really isn't the right word to describe these cocktails, each is made extremely well with great care, have a fantastic balance of flavours and you'll find amongst some good old favourites, some really great modern twists.I would highly recommend the Aviation No.3 which is pure nectar. Whilst the Fleur de Framboise is surprisingly delectable, without the normal sharp tones your expect for a dink that features Prosecco.The atmosphere, the attention to detail and the fantastic drinks, definitely makes the salon bar a firm favourite of mine!",

They served steaming hot bread first with butter. Then they offered us sparkling/still water, and then later red/white wine. Later upon refill, the water accidentally poured more still into the sparkling glasses and vice versus for my friends still water. A slight mess up but it was nothing really.The chefs beginning foie gras with red wine reduction was very rich, I couldn't finish but it was delicious.The waiter gave me the carrot starter and I told him I ordered the beetroot but was happy to take the carrots. Another worker told me that he'd give me the beetroot and that we could share the carrot dish! It was delicious too, the beetroot was refreshing.The quail is one of the best things I've ever had, honey is the perfect flavor to treat your meats. The side of \"famous\" mashed potatoes was also amazingly buttery. The rum baba might not be for those who don't like rum or sponge cake, but the vanilla cream is so light and sweet.The petit four was also a nice bite at the end.",

Not a 5 Star because the feel, ambiance of restaurant seemed very causal, maybe it was the black and white checkers that reminded you of a steak and shake. I personally enjoyed the food, small portions and creative plates but my partner whom is more of a wine snob than a foodie liked his experience at La Petite Maison which the total bill there was double the cost mainly because of you be Wine. I would still recommend that go here to experience the food. May favorite starter is the Fois grad \u00a0hamburgers. Fois is something I never would have gotten in the past (bad experience) but I discovered it's all how the chef prepares it.",

The place has a romantic setting and the chef and his workers cook in the kitchen thats right in front of you. The unison of the staff is great! The full course meal is amazing. I had their steak the first time. It was so amazing I had to go there a second time. They start you off with a selection of bread and butter. Their water was 6 pounds which makes sense for the restaurant to charge that much. Afterwards, they bring you 3 small complimentary appetizers. Their molecular gastronomy techniques are excellent. Hard for me to describe the taste so I will leave photos of them after the review. Next was the 20 oz steak with jalapeno peppers and finely cut potatoes. They wrap a small bundle of rosemary to enhance the flavor of the steak. This steak was and still is, the best steak I have ever had. On the side is their famous smashed potatoes and it definitely has an exquisite taste. Lastly they gave me complimentary desert that was a great palate clenser. All for only 55 pounds. If this was a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, I can't imagine what a 3 star will taste like. I can still imagine the soft firm taste like it was yesterday. Until one day, I will come back to this place",

    "text": "We were excited to see that there were reservations available on a Saturday night. \u00a0We booked a 10:30 PM slot. When we arrived, our table was not ready. \u00a0We were sent up to a lounge where we were given menus for cocktails. No one ever came by to take our order while others were being seated and helped. Finally, after 30 minutes, someone came by. He was extremely apologetic and provided us with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine. \u00a0About ten minutes after that, and fort minutes after our reservation time, we were seated.Someone promptly came to give us menus and bread. \u00a0There were no bread plates, so after several minutes we had to ask. \u00a0My friend ordered a diet coke. \u00a0The waiter took our order and then a few minutes later someone else came to take our order.We ordered the eight course tasting menu. \u00a0My friend's diet coke never came, so after a few courses, we had to re-order. I ordered a cocktail, the Secreta Negrita around the first course. It came around around the seventh course. That was ridiculous. I didn't get it until I threatened to cancel the drink order.Our dessert took forever, at least 25-30 minutes after we finished the last course, which was strange because the other courses came out at a nice pace. By this time, people were banging pots and cleaning without seeing if we needed anything. I kept having to flag down people for water.We had the eight course tasting menu. \u00a0Course 1: Tempura - This is not your Japanese style tempura. These were fresh vegetables wrapped in a light tempura batter. \u00a0Simple and delicious with a light cucumber and mint cream.Course 2: Caviar - The caviar was served over crab with potatoes vichyssoise. This was beautifully plated on a plate with palms painted on it and a bowl of ice underneath the dish. \u00a0Very beautiful. \u00a0The caviar was on top, and then the potatoes vichyssoise, and underneath was the delicious crab. The combination was superb. Course 3: Seared Scallop - This was beautifully presented on a half shell on top of potatoes mousseline. The scallop was seared perfectly. The texture and flavors were supreme.Course 4: Gyoza - This was a chicken and leek gyoza in a hibiscus broth. The broth was slightly sweet and acidic. It was so good that I didn't leave a drop in the bowl. \u00a0The gyoza was my least favorite. \u00a0It didn't taste any better than the dollar dumplings in NYC, aside from the soft (vs dollar dumplings' rubbery) texture!Course 5: Foie Gras with a similar hibiscus broth/juice from the previous course. This was my favorite! \u00a0It was a generous portion, and it really melted in my mouth, truly a wonderful experience.Course 6: John Dory with a tandoori-lime emulsion. This was my second least favorite course. It was good, but the texture was a bit rough. I never had John Dory before, so maybe that's how it's supposed to be. I really liked the broth, and it came with baby clams.Course 7: I had the lamb cutlets. My friend had the quail stuffed with foie gras. Both came with a mashed potato that was to die for. It was the thickest and creamiest mashed potato I ever had. I had my lamp medium well. It was tender and savory. This was around the time I got my drink, La Secreta Negrita. \u00a0It's truly a dessert in itself, a creamy mezcal drink with a chocolate treat inside. \u00a0At this point someone put a bowl of the mashed potatoes in front of us and didn't say anything. \u00a0Several minutes passed by with it sitting there, so we asked about it. And the waiter said he ordered it by mistake. We gratefully indulged!Course 8: Herb sorbet and kiwi puree with a light Sorbet AND Chocolate Mousse with Oreo cookies. \u00a0This was worth the wait. Overall, a beautiful venue with fresh vegetables serving as decor and strong red colors that make the ambiance. \u00a0The food is divine. \u00a0If they can get their service in order, this would be the perfect experience!",

Cocktails to start, gorgeous combination of spirits, decorated with fruit and flowers. Little palette cleansers in between, that were fresh and flavoursome.I had the duck, duck bon bons and cherries, it was cooked perfectly, and tasted divine. It was only then that we realised we were sat facing the open plan kitchen, they were working so quietly, efficiently and cleanly they didn't disturb anyone.Before desert, we were given little petit fours of truffles and gorgeous raspberry marshmallows. We ordered pots of tea, with super attentive service I wasn't allowed to pour my own. My friend's desert in particular was amazing, with a beret of leopard print painted chocolate, my desert was also perfect, but not quite as pretty.I would definitely come here again, really did love it.",

Turns out it did not live up to the Michelin star expectation. #disappointedWe were sat at the bar area elbow touching elbow with the customers next to us. I could literally read who the customer next to me was whatsapping. There was a couple sitting next to my friend, talking about her mum #wedidntwanttoknowherstoriesok(!). Cosy was not what I was expecting. The bread came without the butter. We waited for a few minutes thinking the butter was on its way. Sadly it did not show up and we had to request it. I felt that the waiting staff should be more attentive. The starters, mains and desserts were decent. However, it just felt that we were having fine dining at a cosy ramen bar. The last disappointment hit when the coffee came without the chocolates/sweets. The waitress did inform us that the sweets were on their way. Though they never show up and we ended up asking for them. All in all, a huge let down.",

    "text": "Big disappointment for a Michelin starred restaurant. The meal left me quite sick well into the night and next day. I started feeling sick after the third course and was was sick until the night. Husband had the regular tasting menu and I had the vegetarian. He liked his; I did not like mine at all. The two stars is for husband liking his meal. However, The vegetarian courses were quite heavy and complex, but in a way I found overwhelming and \"tried too hard.\" The beetroot and poached quail egg dishes were nice. \u00a0Aside from the somewhat disappointing food courses, the service was very patchy. We asked to see the sommelier a few times before she appeared, a promised dessert wine never came, and courses took a while to come out even when we were the last people there and they were cleaning to close. The worst part was that we saw at least one mouse running about the restaurant. One if the waiters stomped his feet to scurry away the mouse. When that mouse or another one reappeared, another waiter blamed it on the door being left open. The hostess said, \" don't worry madam-- it's a mini one.\" \u00a0That statement did not work in their favor. The door was not open and seemed unlikely that the mouse had run in from the outside as this was pretty far into the end of the restaurant and there are two separate doors by the entrance. That's not acceptable for any restaurant, much less a Michelin started one. It completely ruined my appetite for the last dessert course that took too long to come.",

A few standouts-Lamb chops- maybe the best lamb I've ever eaten. Perfect. Blacken Cod- pretty good. But not the best I've ever eaten. Foie gras stuffed quail- very good especially the quail. In the downside the deserts didn't wow us. My Oreo cookie chocolate entree was just so so. \u00a0My wife had a mango sorbet / homemade candy concoction which was also just ok. Service was good and friendly- which it should be for the prices you pay and the mandatory service charge. Had this restaurant been 20% cheaper it would be an easy 4 or even 5*.",

You feel like you're entering a Chinese torture room with antechamber and all. The service was awkward. They sit everyone at the bar looking into the kitchen so the service is impersonal. Also, every time the chef said something, the minions would say, \"oui, chef\" and it got very annoying after the 70th time. Also, i ordered a Sazerac and it took over 30 minutes!!! I have no idea what happened. Someone dropped the ball? After 30 minutes i told them to just forget it but eventually they ended up bringing it anyway as a freebie. Regarding the honesty, i dont know. I didnt like the exorbitant pricing for a lackluster experience. Two hamburger sliders for example was \u00a321 (almost USD$30). If they had made the whole experience more personalized, intimate, and awesome i wouldnt mind the price. I also felt they were more interested in making money than providing an experience. \u00a0After asking for the check, it was very awkward. They kept opening and closing the pocketbook with the check and whispering amongst themselves. At one point i got annoyed and asked, \"is that mine? Is there a problem?\" Even after setting it down, Two seemingly managers came to open the pocketbook again and look at the check. ::rolls eyes:: oh, lastly, the maitre'd seemed annoyed when we arrived.",

It's the whole experience of Robuchon to sit at the bar. We've sat st the bar. The only experience is that you are not able to talk to your companions. It's loud in the restaurant anyway. They said they sat a table right before we came in because its first come first served despite us having a reservation. Not accommodating at all. They really push the bar area every time you go because no one really wants to sit at the bar. If everyone enjoyed the bar so much, all of the tables \u00a0would not have been filled.

    "text": "Hmmmm. For mere mortals, you can't look at l'Atelier Joel Robuchon in a purely comestible-based light. Wonderful though much of the food is, when you come to settle up at the end of the evening... well... can you feel that hollow sensation around your upper torso? That's where all your money used to be, as you just shelled out over \u00a3200 on dinner for two. And I didn't even have a digestif. It's a sort of Japanese-styled succession of very, very tiny French tasting dishes. Sorry, I should explain: not Japanese food, but served in a restaurant that's as close to being a bento box interior as I've ever seen. Now I know how salmon teriyaki feels. You're brought these tiny, delicate little courses, and you have this sort of explosion of taste, then it goes away, and you have some more wine, and wait for the next one. We ordered 2 mini-things and one more substantial course each and I have to say that we left feeling sated, if not (whisper it) full. Maybe it was just the sensory overload. Don't worry... neither felt the urge to scoff a pizza on the way home. It was a real experience, and one I'll think back to fondly on more than one occasion. If you're being taken, go easy on the paying partner though. You don't HAVE to order the lobster.",

Is it another business-man opening branches?? Tried L'atelier twice. The ambience is really nice and cool, with modern and innovative decoration. Its more of a place to chill and have a bite instead of a proper long-stay dining place. You can sit on a bar or tall tables with stools, it's fine though, you enjoy. The mythological-must-try-speciality is the potato puree.. I know sounded weird to me as well but its really an interesting story! Everything fair and good enough till here. Now the downside. Although the food very good and tasty the portions. GOD really tiny ! And yes I know what gourmet kitchen is and what the word L'Atelier stands for. The story is that you cannot really sell L'atelier-styled food and charge for 2 big portions! Come on! From my experience so far this is the restaurant with smallest portions, except if you try the steak which will probably compensate a bit to your stomach. The two stars missing from my rating is because of the relation Price/Quantity. You really wouldn't wanna go there on empty stomach! Overall: A nice place with comfortable environment BUT very bad relation of Price vs Quality/Quantity.",

The others (who ate meat!) enjoyed their meal much more. Can't really add much more than the others have already written, except for they do a set lunch which is \u00a319 for two courses or \u00a325 for three.

The Egg or the Burger are to be recommended, as is the pur\u00e9e (50% potatoes, 50% butter!).Sit at the bar, watch the cooks cautiously prepare your plate and relax, it's well worth it (also, note they have a vertical garden on the wall, very trendy!)",

We asked if this sort of thing happens often, and we were told that they didn't rush people along with our meal, later we found that this simply isn't true. From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us terribly badly; they were so hot and cold that my partner asked me: 'what have we done wrong?' \u00a0I am convinced that our waiter was high, he didn't blink once, was sweating profusely, had no idea of personal space and kept saying 'YUMMY, YUMMY' every time he put our food down.  As there was a delay in seating us we missed the 10 course menu, a real shame as the majority of what we ordered was terrible. \u00a0We were given a bread basket to start with, with no butter or oil, the French bread was so stale I would have reservations about feeding it to pigeons up the road in Trafalgar square! We both started with the Ravioli of Foie Gras in a chicken broth, this was terrible it reminded me of instant chicken and noodle soup. \u00a0I then had the stuffed clams- these were average, frankly I have had better at a local bistro. My partner had the lamb; he said the best part of this was the mash potato. \u00a0We both then finished off our mains with the quail stuffed with foie gras served with truffle mash potato, this was really very good, but completely ruined by the lack lustre service we received the truffle mash 10 minutes after we received the quail. The dessert was the lowest point of the meal and tasted like a tesco's finest chocolate cheese cake. This year we have eaten at Gordon Ramsay's Royal Hospital, The Vineyard, La Trompette and Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons (my personal favourite); if you have \u00a3150 per person to spend eat at any of these other places.

I am happy to pay a lot of money for an excellent experience, but this just wasn't. This was mainly down to the service, which was indifferent at best - I'd've been unimpressed being served this way at a chain restaurant. It wasn't 'informal' - it was disinterested, cold and not even competent. The food was excellent. But I've had far better meals for less money in places which - crucially - had a far better atmosphere. We sat downstairs in the 'atelier' - perhaps things might've been better upstairs in the formal restaurant, but we chose downstairs because we wanted to try out a tapas-y approach to fine dining. The service spoilt this place for me. I actually refused to pay the service charge, for the first time ever. I am the sort of person who gets embarrassed when things are disappointing and I once didn't send back a still-frozen lasagne in a pub because I didn't want to offend anyone(!!!!!), so this is a big deal. I emailed to say how awful the service had been and someone wrote back offering us a free bottle of house champagne next time we dined there. Our meal, with wine, cost \u00a3200 for two. No ta. We went to Clos Maggiore a couple of weeks later to try to erase the bad memories and that was much better.",

I am willing to spend an obscene amount of money at a restaurant but only if i am blown away. In fact, not only was i nowhere near blown away but i can confidently say that i did not consume anything that was anywhere near memorable!This restaurant is way overpriced for what is essentially quite average food.My dining partner and I, opted for the tasting menu at \u00a3125 each. The amouse bouche seemed to signal a good start but unfortunately there was no highlight, no surprises, nothing really.The inclusion of expensive ingredients (black truffle,caviar & alot of fois gras) was, I felt, a way of justifying the ludicrous prices. However, as a discerning diner i must say that if it was simply about the ingredients anyone can buy them for less and have them at home!The point of making the effort and paying so much money is to sample great skill and creativity with great ingredients. Sadly, this was most definitely not the case at l'atelier. The reputation does precede this restaurant and one does expect alot, but at these prices one should!I do not advise anyone to dine here. Having said that, i think that the fixed price lunch for \u00a327 may not leave you with as bad a taste as i have been left with!Total failure. In fact i can honestly say : APPALLING!!",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon's new London restaurant brings with it the 'atelier' or workshop approach to eating, when one sits at a counter and watches the chefs prepare the food a few feet away. It's common in Japan and works extremely well here, particularly as the leather bar stools are comfortable. The menu has a page of delicious small tasting dishes, which are basically half a starter size, to encourage you to have several. In fact one could eat entirely from the tasting dishes and try 90% of what's on the menu - but they are not cheap - between \u00a310-20. We went for the \u00a319 set-price lunch and experienced exemplary cooking - particularly a richly-reduced sweet onion soup. The waiter behind the counter was instantly accessible and although Hungarian, recommended an absolutely superb Grune Veltliner which came by the glass and caused us to spend much more on the wine than the food. The whole place (there is a standard-type restaurant and a bar as well) has a well-managed feel and with cooking and prices (at least at lunch) of that order, it should quickly become a favourite",

    "text": "For full review and picture please refer tohungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  I love pre-theatre menus. How else would one be able to regularly dine at Michelin starred restaurants in London without for instance being a stock broker (before the credit crunch) or a professional footballer? One of these restaurants is L'Atelier de Joel Robouchon in the middle of the theatre district in Covent Garden just next to The Ivy which offers a 2 course set menu for 22 pounds, 3 courses for 27 pounds. The French chef Joel Robouchon who has achieved more Michelin stars than any other chef (25 if Wikipedia is to be believed) has restaurants all over the globe. Two of these stars are held by the London joint of L'Atelier Joel Robouchon. So believe me \u00a0my expectations were higher than high and I was looking forward to a stunning meal. The restaurant is impressively beautiful. The elegant and stylish dining area is dimly lit and decorated in a red and black theme (I was not so sure about the apples in the big bowl (see below) but what do I know about interior decoration?). There are high tables and bar stools and, around the central kitchen area, patrons are seated at the counter and can watch the chefs preparing their dishes. Sometimes the service in high end restaurants can be a bit patronizing but the service at L'Atelier Joel Robouchon was absolutely perfect. Obliging and polite and, when they brought as the wrong main course, three people came one after the other to apologise (which was maybe slightly over the top). Also a very nice touch was that, when the wine we had ordered was not available, the somelier exchanged it with a (very delicious) cheaper one. Even though we 'only' had the pre-theater menu, they did not rush us at all to leave after we had finished. Unfortunately the food was not as enjoyable and exceptional as I had expected. Of the 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from a very autumn-style, mushroom-based menu we commenced our meal with Egg Cocotte Topped with Wild Mushroom Cream. The soft-boiled egg was at the bottom of the glass topped with a very tasty mushroom cream. It was nice but did not blow me away and I did not like the consistency too much. The second starter also embraced the autumn theme: Wild mushrooms served with Puff Pastry consisted of perfectly cooked, delectable wild mushrooms on light pastry. This was rather enjoyable dish but again not terribly special. We choose two different mains: RS really liked The Razor Clams served with White Wine Emulsion and Leek Fondue. I only had a small taste of it, far too much dill for my liking. The Crunchy chicken breast with Curry Sauce and Pilaw Rice was rather mediocre. The nicely cooked chicken was too salty and the combination of elements of chicken katsu curry and the Indian influences of the Pilaw rice were not convincing, especially for a 2 star restaurant. Now the question is \u00a0if you have a pre-theatre/ good value set menu in a Michelin star restaurant, would you expect the set menu to be of the same quality as the a la carte? I do, and L'Atelier Joel Robouchon did not deliver. Does this mean now I have to save and go back to try the a la carte (assuming that the Michelin inspectors know their job)? Or do I just give up on old Joel?",

    "text": "L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was the best thing that happened to my fiance and I on our recent visit to London. The best thing that happened in our dining experience, that is. Being the foodies that we are, we did alot of research before we embarked on our trip and part of the process involved making reservations at must-eat places before we left Chicago for London. Needless to say, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon was in our must-eat places.We were seated at the bar. Actually, it's not really a bar either since you're not sitting in front of the bartender, but it's a high top counter that allows you to see all the action going on in the kitchen. What a fantastic experience seeing the kitchen crew prepping appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had baked clams with minced garlic and mushrooms and the clams were served on a thick bed of sea salt. I ordered an entree of spaghetti which will make you think, \"What?! You ordered spaghetti in a 2-Michelin star restaurant? How boring!\" But wait til you hear what the spaghetti came with: sea urchin! Sea urchin and spaghetti = divine. I've only had sea urchin sashimi-style in sushi restaurants and have always loved it. And now having sea urchin Joel Robuchon-style tops it all. The sea urchin was used to make the creamy and there were also bite-size pieces of sea urchin hidden in the sauce. When I bit into it, the texture reminded me of foie gras. I think they don't always have sea urchin on the menu because it seems like they constantly change what goes into the spaghetti. My fiance had fried langoustine, duck liver pate, and octopus salad which he all loved very much. For dessert, we shared the Rum Baba which was absolutely divine. The sponge cake was soaked with rum that you can actually taste very well. in fact, the rum was pretty strong. This was what stood out for me because it's not one of those desserts that claim to have liqueur in it although you can't really taste it. We also got Irish coffee to go with dessert. They have several types of alcoholic coffee drinks, depending on the several countries of origin of whiskeys they offer.The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions. This place isn't pompous or pretentious at all. You can dress up fancy here or show up in jeans and you won't feel out of place. Ask to sit at the kitchen bar, if they don't already seat you there.",

The martini menu is extensive and has some exciting mixes. The tasting menu [which the executive chef Olivier Limousin did me a solid, and made it for me alone, which usually is only done for the whole table [party] as it is a complex and hard menu] has some really award wordy dishes.Why five star? ok because it's the best tapas I've ever eaten, it don't get better then this. Yes 105quid for a nine dish tasting menu is quite high but totally worth it. If you say this is no tapas, than it's a four star restaurant.",

Bob and I were in London over the holidays and I saw that not only was there a reservation available at L'Atelier, but that there was also a price fix menu we could take a part of. We (naturally) decided to go with the price fix menu with the European wine flights and sat on the first floor - at the counter concept restaurant. The feel is very loungy - dark red, black and dim lighting. The counter wraps around the entire kitchen and you then have the added benefit of watching the talented chefs prep your food. Although there is a slight downside... you do get to see how much fantastic butter is being used. The food was absolutely beyond amazing. Everything tasted delicious, fresh, inventive - all the good adjectives that you would use to describe a great meal. The highlight of the meal was the mashed potatoes. OMG. These were probably the best potatoes I have ever had in my life. Sadly, the server thought that we were done and did snatch away our remaining spoonful... I literally thought about jumping over the counter and tackling her for that last morsel. It sounds ridiculous that mashed potatoes could be that good, but these were velvety smooth and just absolutely delicious. We were a little surprised by how many white wines were in the flight, but everything was paired beautifully. The service was very good - it was very different than the traditional table seating since we didn't have an assigned server per se. It was more casual than the food suggests, but still prompt and friendly. Overall, if you're looking for a fancy night out - or just in the mood to treat yo'self - check out this restaurant. And be prepared to latch on to those potatoes with an iron grip!",

Being a two-Michelin-starred restaurants, I was expecting a really blow-you-out-of-your-mind experience, but the restaurant didnt quite deliver. The food was very artfully presented, and you can watch them cooking the food and searing things in the open kitchen. The restaurant decor was beautifully done, with a large living wall on the far end. But a couple of things put me off. One was the service was a bit too smarmy. Maybe I am just a troglodyte, but I dont need people hovering over me with every step and course constantly checking to see if I was OK, or if I needed anything. I suppose there are people out there who require this sort of attention to validate themselves, but I dont care for it; it was almost as if they were willing to cut my meat for me, and maybe even pre-chew it for me so that I wouldnt have to lift a finger. If that is what 2 stars gets you, then I can give it a miss. The other thing was that the portions are a bit small and the food did not blow me away. I was expecting every bite to be a mouth orgasm, but that didnt happen. Go there if you need to impress someone, and go there if you are the type that needs to be seen at michelin-starred restaurant. But dont go if you expect a full belly at the end of your meal.",

    "text": "My only visit here was not on a happy occasion. One of my best friends was leaving London (under less than ideal circumstances), and he wanted to have a treat at a good restaurant on his last day in town. He found out about a two course lunch offer for \u00a319, and we walked in for my first visit to a michelin 2 star restaurant.It takes a while to find this place, tucked away as it is in one of the many otherwise unknown alleys around leicester square.The seating was unusual. Everybody were seated in tall stools next to the bar. I don't know what the purpose was, as it was pretty uncomfortable. We didn't interact with the chef ... but the guy who was serving us did spend quite a lot of time around us ... the attention was evident.The food was exactly as i have come to expect from good french restaurants in London ... very good ... very tasty ... and very little. It tingles your taste buds, and leaves you craving for more (and if you indulge, be prepared for bankruptcy :p). The wild boar and foie gras was something i hadn't had before and i really liked it. With the wine and the dessert, our bill came to northwards of \u00a340 per head even with the discount offer, so you can guess how expensive this restaurant usually is, but totally worth a visit (my friend had a pleasant last lunch in London) .",
