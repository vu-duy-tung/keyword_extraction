It's cheap, too: you can get more food than a person can eat for \u00a310. It's also open until very late (5am on Saturday and Sunday), so it's always there when you get the munchies.I think it says a lot that, one the trip where I discovered Star Kebab, my GF and I ate there 3-4 times. And, on a subsequent trip, we took the tube from Marleybone to Earl's Court to eat there 3-4 more times.Amusing side story: I went there one night after hitting the pub. i asked for their spiciest curry; the guy behind the counter seemed reluctant, and asked me several times if I was sure. I said I was. Back in our hotel room, I took a bite, and OMG it was the spiciest thing I ever ate! I'm surprised that the curry didn't burn through the Styrofoam container! It was THAT hot!",

My friend and I walked in at about 8pm and it was not hay crowded. Small building with a small seating area but expected in London. Very warm inside after the heat wave that was sweeping through the U.K. We both ordered the chicken kebabs which was in a tortilla like thing. You had the option of having a cole-slaw topping in it along with a choice of sauce. Pretty \u00a0good price but I suggest getting the larger portion since it is about 3 times bigger for only a small increase in price. We brought the food back home and it smelled great. Tasted great but about an hour after eating it we felt a little sick with stomach aches. Our other room mates had not had this side affect after eating Star Kabob the times they went. It was not extreme but still not a comfortable feeling. Besides the minor stomach ache after, it was very good with good portion sizes. The fries you can get are very good as well. Took a Tums after and felt fine. Will definitely go back since it is very close. Overall, another good restaurant with friendly staff in the Earl's Court area.",

Very good options and flavorful.Not a lot of room to eat so plan to stand or take it away. The flavor of the food was fresh and the options of sauces was great. I highly recommend this and the prices were unbeatable.",

This time... you guessed it....bad .. i was soo looking forward to my chicken shawarma. The first bit I took I actually liked but on the second... blaaa. The main issue was the freshness the chicken was old for sure. I also got pieces of tendon which I absolutely hate. I will say that the sauces were very good (sweet chili and garlic mayo). If the chicken wasn't soo bad, I know I would have enjoyed it.",

We tried spicy lamb, eggplant, and mild chicken and loved them all equally. The girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Take away is the best choice because the dining space is tiny and not especially ambient. I know when I return home I will be remembering Star Kebab and wishing it were close to my house!",

We had the biryani rice and chicken tikka masala. Don't be fooled by the abundant red paste in the masala. There is a lot of chicken underneath. The whole dish had a nice spicy kick. The rice was also flavorful. The gentleman that helped us was very friendly and helpful. If I'm ever in London again, I'll definitely be back!",

Please save yourselves and just go to King's Kebab a bit more down the road, MUCH cleaner and the currys are delicious, a 5 on the official hygeine rating (Rating is from 0-5, 0 being the worst and 5 being the best) - although Im not too keen on the kebabs there but they are decent for a kebab shop.",

Very affordable (\u00a35) and in generous quantities (I couldn't finish it!)-I recommend splitting if you have a smaller appetite. Makes it more affordable!Negatives:-Generally not friendly. Not sure why, but it made the atmosphere awkward.Overall, it fulfills its title! Good, cheap fast food to take on the go or to the nearest park. I will be returning during my stay here.",

    "text": "Zahoor has been serving up the finest in slowly marinated spiced kebab meats in the same location, with the same menu, for more than 40 years. His secret: serving 100% meat, no filler, that's been slowly cooking in his family's sown blend of herbs and spices for hours until it's served up in a delicious fresh grilled pita or tandoori naan. I sampled the lamb doner and mixed kebab pita, because I just couldn't manage to eat only one! After sampling kebab all over the US, I can honestly say I've never eaten anything like this. Tender, juicy meat, delicious pita, fresh crunchy salad and of course topped with his very own spicy chili sauce to give it the kick it needs to finish perfectly. I also sampled his spicy lamb and chicken curries, that build heat the way a Hitchcock film builds tension: slowly, without avail, and always with a powerful ending. Zahoor himself is a man of the people, with several local folks dropping by just to say hello or introduce him to someone from out of town. And of course, Zahoor knows everyone by name and relevant details of their lives. The care and passion he pours into his food resonates deeply within the community, as his kebab house is a Kensington staple and one of the longest running in the area. We spoke at length about food, our background and never have I been made to feel at home the way I have here. This isn't a recommendation; it's a rite of passage. Be sure to stop by next time you're in Kensington or if you decide to make the trip. You'll be glad you did.",
