    "text": "If you're in London and anywhere near Covent Garden, this charming little restaurant is a must visit. Quaint indoor and outdoor seating and classic British cuisine perfectly presented and proportioned. The Salt Bread is a great way to start. Fresh baked, crisp crust, soft center and sumptuously saline. Worth the calories and sodium rush. For an appetizer, the Crispy Duck Salad is divine. The duck is shredded and crunchy with a light plum sauce atop radish slices. Watermelon and pomegranate seeds add a flourish of flavor that makes the entire dish the perfect blend of taste and texture. For the mains we enjoy a Shepard's Pie and a Whole Sole Meuni\u00e8re. The pie was a light bend of lamb and beef topped with a gratin of potato and sprigs of rosemary. Presented with a light pour of gravy, this dish was surprisingly delicate and delicious as opposed to what can be a cloying and overwhelming clumpy stew. I will absolutely order it again. The sole presented whole before being deboned into a beautiful filet. Lemony, fresh, and bright with a lightly dressed side of rocket. Yum. We ended our meal with a Flourless Chocolate Cake with caramel corn, vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. A little dry, but a fun presentation and certainly satisfying. I must also add that our waiter, Jeff, was new on the job but you would never know. He was attentive and charming and took good care of us. We will definitely visit The Ivy the next time we are in London. No pretense, just a lovely meal that is deliciously memorable.",

For brunch I love the crumpets with their home made 'Marmite' butter and someone who does not like Marmite I love this on the crumpets. The veggie breakfast is good but is big enough to feed two so I normally have the smoked salmon with the sourdough. So good. For dinner the menu is full of the classics from the Ivy so fill your boots but make sure to save room for the chocolate bombe. It is heaven covered in salted caramel. It is probably one of the best desserts I have ever had and those that know me know I love the dessert.",

We went for Sunday brunch, one friend was pregnant and asked for her eggs to be well done, which they arrived very runny-a simple request surely? After sending it back, she received her eggs almost as we were finishing our meal, so she was rushing to eat it. I had the truffled chicken sandwich which the toasted brioche was soaked in oil (as was the side salad) which was extremely salty, and really too rich too eat, \u00a0 my friend had ordered the fish pie which, like my sandwich came out lukewarm. \u00a0As a consequence I did suffer from food poisoning for the next few days.

Very high quality service and attention to detail. My hotel was around the corner and I came here several times. Even with the constant flow of tourists they remembered me and always gave quality service. For example, I ordered a glass of red wine and mentioned to the bartender that it tasted somewhat bitter. He immediately tasted the wine, agreed, and opened a new bottle. The hostesses are warm and inviting. In addition to their professionalism they are very charming and polite. The food is good working toward being great. \u00a0If I had to give a 1 to 10 number I'd say 9, which is incredible considering there are few regulars and mostly single-visit tourists.

It's the same price as most of the rip-off burger joints / overpriced sandwich chains but it comes with fabulous decor of green leather and wood, swift service and The Ivy's famous fish and chips.Most importantly, this is a place for people in the know. Although it's affordable, people assume The Ivy is expensive so they stay away. This means you feel like you're part of a hidden secret every time you escape the crowds and head for this sanctuary. Tables are kept for walk-ins and we didn't book and managed to get a table at 2pm on a Saturday.I had a cheeseburger, which was thick and perfectly cooked. Lettuce, tomato and gherkins came on the side so you could build your own burger. I like a burger plain as the meat was thick enough already so I was happy with the deconstruction. Fish and chips were the best though - crispy battery, light fish and delicious skin-on chips with a tangy tartare sauce and lemons wrapped in posh Muslin cloth.There were two of us and we had two courses and champagne (obvs) and it came to \u00a365 - I thought that was great value. If you just had a main course each, expect to pay about \u00a330 which is excellent value for Covent Garden.Towards the end of our lunch, service became slow and we had to wave our arms in the air to pay the bill. But otherwise it's a solid 4.",

Bearing in mind its location is likely to attract a very transient, touristy crowd, the restaurant seem to have captured the best of those so it all felt very civilised and stylish - just what you'd come to expect from The Ivy - but without airs & graces. The elegant Ivy styling never fails to impress and the food was good; only good though -nothing that made you straighten up and really take notice, but nice nonetheless. Crispy duck salad was stingy on the duck and heavy on the radish, but fresh & tasty still. Mackerel pate was creamy & lovely but with 1 too many bones for our liking, so nervousness tainted our enjoyment of that. Shepherd's Pie was lovely but somehow, having tasted The Depot's sublime version in Barnes, it didn't blow me away, which I'd rather hoped it would.",

We were running late, by about 30 minutes, and when we called to inform them, they were very accommodating and kept our table. We had a corner table booth that was turned to face the entire restaurant. Our server was very pleasant and answered any questions we had. One dish we requested was specifically a breakfast item that was supposed to be served only until 11:30 am, but they gave us no trouble in requesting it anyway. We ordered:Eggs Royale - smoked salmon, two poached hen's eggs, toasted English muffin with hollandaise sauce and watercress. Delicious. The English muffin was toasted perfectly, not burnt. Slightly buttered. Not a greasy dish at all. Tasteful. I would recommend this.Baked egg white omelette - goat's cheese and kale with rocket and watercress. Now I asked for no goat's cheese, but to add tomato and onion. They did add the tomato and onion, but got rid of both the goat's cheese and kale. No big deal - I didn't have much of a problem with that. The omelette itself was actually really delicious. It was a large omelette and the eggs were extremely fluffy. It's a nice touch to bake it. From the flavor and texture, it seemed as though there was quite a bit of butter used, negating the egg white part, but the overall dish was delicious. I would get it again.HLT - grilled halloumi cheese, avocado, lettuce and tomato served with thick cut chips. This was good, but not great. Wouldn't particularly recommend it or order it again, but there was nothing wrong with it. Served on crusty white bread with a really weird green, herby mayo sauce, which we were happy to have requested on the side. The halloumi is very thin and was a bit rubbery in texture. Chips were not bad.Ambiance is nice. It's an old school vibe with lots of wood, leather, and a green/white/gold decor. Prices are pretty reasonable for the type of restaurant. Location is great. Nothing spectacular, but I'd say this restaurant is a solid find for classic upscale British food.",

    "text": "The big red double decker busses roll by, and a shabbily dressed man stands in a corner, just out of the misty rain, smoking...it's a fine London afternoon. The painted mimes of Convent Garden are doing their thing, the plaster on their bodies turning to silvery tears. Remember in Atonement when Robbie goes by to visit Cecelia at the hospital cafeteria just before leaving for the frontline in France. It's just like that. All hard wood, and glass, the clinking of fork to plate, and the noise of people chatting, their muffled babble resonating like a flock of excited, exotic birds. All very well, and informal and charmingly British. Just like in a movie. (Did I ever tell about the time I fell in love with a darling Japanese girl who had studied her English in London? She broke my heart, not by losing her, but missing the sound of her voice)A thrill ran through me. I love the nailhead seafoam leather chairs, the brushed brass lighting fixtures, the layered tablecloths. A smell of lilac, cinnamon, and mint. Seated in the atrium (I had used the name James Mcavoy when making my reservation, I often do this, in hopes of securing premium seating. It's a shot in the dark, but you never can tell right?), the room feels overworked, there is a huge Sunday afternoon crowd, and the rain turns torrential. Nevertheless, spirits are high. This is not the Ivy, so don't expect it. Think of it as a well dressed T.G.I Friday's. Nor should you be expecting some marvelous view of Saint Paul's (least not in the rain). I ordered the Market Grill Shepard Pie, slow roasted lamb shoulder and cheddar mash, and a side of almond green beans. My companion ordered the warm truffle chicken sandwich and chips (fries). The latter: Menu reads (inserts are by moi), \"warm truffled chicken with mayonnaise, toasted white bloomer (a London dense, crusty sandwich bread), fried hen's egg (where else dose the egg come from?), chips (again, fries here) and green salad \u00a311.95\" (oddly priced?). Save yourself the trouble. For all the effort of plating, nothing can fix this mess. Completely without flavor, the chicken with the \"hen's egg\" (what? not a rooster? a capon?) is some sadly ironic Douglas Adams thing that came from a bag, frozen, with all it's little mates. You surely don't think they're bringing in whole birds, dissecting them for a poultry (pun) \u00a312? It is what it is...Market Grill Shepard Pie: It tasted exactly like cheeseburger helper with instant mashed potatoes (I'm sure they're not instant, but tasted that way) piled on top, that had been lightly buttered (probable clarified, or ghee) and slid under a salamander until the potato peaks browned, and began to shrivel. Having grown up eating cheeseburger helper, I can say this with certainty. It just taste that way. Green beans were standard. Blood Mary was delicious and not overly decorated to raise the price (\u00a38.50). Coffee was not Folgers. I can't say I was totally disappointed. I had a idea of what to expect. It's the Ivy's slow, slightly dim witted brother, who loves to to be seen, but should never be heard, with average food at moderate prices. Keep you expectations in line. The decor is incredible, and the linen napkins (I snagged a couple) meaningful. When I see my pics, I hear Cecelia saying \"Jeffery, come back to me. Come back. Come back.\"But, I don't think so. But...I still like the sound of Cheeseburger Helper. :) Aloha",

I choose this place because it was convenient to Covent Garden Market and near our hotel. The restaurant was beautiful and service was spot on. The toast here was thick and toasted to perfection, served with some room temperature salted butter. Oh, how I heart salted butter. The breakfast itself was just ok though. The eggs were nicely cooked but the sausage was average and the black pudding and bacon were below. The beans were also just ho-hum. Also at 13.50, it was the most expensive Full English I had while in town. If you are in the area and want breakfast, I do not think you can go wrong dining here but do not expect to be wowed. If you want an amazing Full English Breakfast and do not mind traveling, I highly recommend the Electric Diner in Notting Hill. They do it right and you can do a little shopping at Portobello Market while you are in the area.",

    "text": "While increasingly common to find this stylish eatery of the Ivy in more places in greater London, each individual place has its own uniqueness to go with its surroundings. Covent Garden is getting trendy. What used to be a tourist hangout is slowly re-gentrifying itself in the form of higher end restaurants. Just around the corner from Pizza Express you will find white tablecloth establishments serving French sounding menus and this is wonderful. To that the Ivy Market Grill is a small oasis of fashionable eating right off the piazza. Like the other Ivy restaurants the menu is reliably similar serving favourites such as fish cakes, eggs Benedict, along with a bit of champagne of course. So if you want a very good meal in the middle of Covent Garden and the Theater District, the Ivy Market grill is an elegant option.",

    "text": "With some time to kill before wandering around town, I decided to have a quick solo brunch at Ivy Market Grill. It's right in the heart of Covent Garden, with a small area for outdoors seating if the weather is cooperating. Although I came in mid-morning on a Saturday, it was no trouble at all getting a seat for one; in fact, right next to the bar, there are small, snug 'booth seats' that are great for 2 people but are perfect for dining by yourself as well. Inside is quite spacious, with a bit of a throwback vibe - the analog clock behind the bar is a really nice touch. Service was well-timed, allowing myself to enjoy the meal (and the free Wi-Fi, a very helpful aspect for a foreigner) at a leisurely pace. The drink menu was quite good; my Garden of the Abbey was a nice, lightly-flavored cocktail infused with a decent amount of apple overtones and perfect for a brunch drink.The food here was also quite solid. I went with a side of toast to start; each slide was lightly toasted and cut thinly, which was nice - I didn't get stuffed (which happens with the thicker slices usually present in American brunches), and the strawberry preserves were especially tasty. For my main, I went a bit lighter and did the smoked salmon over scrambled eggs. There's no additional carbs on the plate (such as potatoes or an English muffin), making it a relatively small plate for breakfast, but it still packs a lot of punch. The eggs were still a tad runny, which I prefer in my eggs of the scrambled variety, and the smoked salmon here was excellent...you really got the taste of oak in the meat, and the fish itself held up a lot better and had a firmer texture to it than many types of smoked salmon used in breakfast or brunch dishes tend to have (at least in my experience). I almost wish the dish was a little larger, but at under 10 pounds, it's still a very solid deal.In all, I would definitely come back for another meal here - whether for breakfast again, or for lunch or dinner later in the day. The service was alright, but the food and the overall ambiance really stuck out for me (as well as the convenient location). Definitely one of the better casual spots I have been to in London for British food!",

    "text": "The Ivy Market Grill in Covent Garden is a beautiful, busy and buzzing restaurant with delicious food and a delightful wine list that includes a nice selection by the glass. One Saturday evening, I was walking around Covent Garden and spontaneously decided to see if I could get a table at the new Ivy Market Grill. Somewhat surprisingly, they actually had a nice table for me, and I quickly decided to take this opportunity and have dinner there. Something I noticed immediately was how attentive the staff were - almost too much so.The wine list made the choice easy - not due to lack of options, but because the Riesling from Markus Molitor, Haus Klosterberg in the Mosel region in Germany just sounded too good. And it really was a very tasty Riesling, not falling short of my expectations.My dinner then began with some nice and warm bread with a salted crust and soft butter. That's exactly how every decent dinner should start. To properly kick off my dinner, I ordered the Mozzarella di bufala. I probably did not need the roasted pine nuts and seeds, for me those just added an odd flavour to the dish. The plate also had a certain spiciness, which was fine for me. What I enjoyed most besides the mozzarella were the croutons and what I think was roasted pumpkin pieces. Overall, this was a very pleasant starter.The roast duck breast following the starter was pretty delicious. The duck was perfectly cooked, pink and full of flavour. Adding the nice, thick sauce made the meat taste even better. It came with carrots, which were very soft and some green which tasted alright. As side I opted for the truffle parmesan chips. While I was not completely convinced that truffle and parmesan improved the chips in any way, it certainly also did no harm. Like you might expect when you throw truffle at chips, it was a distinctly salty side.To go with the duck, the waiter or sommelier - I can't remember exactly - recommended the Millton Pinot Noir from Gisborne in New Zealand. I am not always a big fan of New World wines, but after I got a little taster, I agreed that it was a good match with my main.After the good starter, I was also very happy with the big chunk of duck breast and the beautiful Pinot Noir along with it. These two courses did not leave me hungry at all. Since I wanted to finish my meal with a dessert, I asked for something small and light, so I ended up with a nice Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.The staff were very friendly and overall, the service was excellent. I only wondered that they did not seamlessly top up the tap water in my glass. Well, maybe I am just a bit spoilt, I somehow expected that at such a place. Anyway, if this is the only \"issue\" you can identify at a restaurant, they did many things right.Summing my experience up: I had a great dinner - the food was tasty, the service faultless and the atmosphere pleasant.",

    "text": "The Ivy Market Grill is located just five minutes away from the Royal Opera House, a fantastic location for those wanting brunch before a matinee show. I met with some friends to enjoy a nice catch up over a nice brunch - and this is exactly what we got. The first thing one notices is the pretty inside decor. A real blast from the past, from the paintings and photos on the walls to the green leather seats, you can't but think you've just taken a time machine to the 50s.The staff are accommodating, though maybe they could communicate with each other better as we were asked for coffee twice from two different waiters. The menu is generous, and offers a lot of choice - on the Sunday we were there the restaurant happened to be out of brown bread, which was a little disappointing.I ordered the Eggs Benedict, not something that can usually go very wrong - but found the muffin very tough yet not very crispy - signs it had been out a while. The hollandaise sauce and the poached eggs were done perfectly, the watercress tasted fresh.After our food the restaurant became busier (this made sense as the 10am slot was the only slot available to book). Some of the meals on the other tables looked very scrumptious and hence this place deserves another visit.Overall, 3 for our food experience, 5 for the location and ambience and another 3 for the service. However I will most definitely be back for another go at the brunch menu.",

I then said, \"ok, give me a regular, give her a decalf, and give us an extra cup.\" She replied \"ok but it's going to be messy.\" So we mixed the two successfully without making a mess, but the idiot waitress should of done the mixing for us. Unbelievable! It took 20+ minutes for me to get my Prosecco... even after asking three times for it. \u00a0And now we've been waiting 10+ minutes for our bill. What a dump! \u00a0The food was cold. For brunch they serve fries with eggs benedict. Who does that?!?! Never again!",

I ordered an Earl Grey tea, and instead was given a breakfast tea. On flagging this up to the waitress, she didnt offer to replace it, and I had to ask her to please bring me the correct tea. She returned a while later with Sencha. I again said that I had ordered Earl Grey and asked for the correct tea. At no point did she apologise, or even seem to care that it took 20 minutes for me to get the right tea.I ordered the eggs royale, my friend had the english breakfast. He was happy with his order and said it was delicious. However, mine had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The eggs were over-cooked (fully hard yolks), and the smoked salmon was now also fully cooked. It tasted okay, but it being over cooked was disappointing. All in all, for a breakfast that was not cheap, I was really unimpressed. The food could be much better - do not leave eggs under a heat lamp!! And the service was very disinterested to the point of being rude. I would not recommend.",

My godfather and I ate here while the renovations were underway, and to be fair I have not been back since because I was just disappointed really. Coming to the Ivy in any of its guises is meant to be a treat, and however attentive the staff were, the food was still disappointing.We had the fish pie, and there is no real good way of saying that the fish was over cooked, I get that doing fish pie is tricky (mostly because you can't see the fish once the potato has been added), but when fish is served in a white sauce it should not feel like it is there to disguise the fact that the fish is massively overcooked.To me the market grill really feels like a knocked down version of the Ivy that is aimed at a less discerning set of patrons; possibly even just the general tourists who eat here just because of the 'Ivy' name.",

My wine was divine, but not as magical as my epic dessert, which they lit on fire right in front of my eyes.

The location was nice compared to my hotel. The exterior was a proper old English building. As I entered I was greeted and seated promptly. I liked they had a sign say no photography. Of course I did get my yelp pictures. I was seated at a nice little table with a cute napkin that contained the restaurant name and logo. My waiter was polite and prompt. He even asked me if I needed additional normally forgotten items - thanks. I decided on the eggs Royale and an orange juice. My juice was delivered quickly along with my requested still water. Ha look at me saying still water like a proper Brit . My meal came out shortly later and was presented fabulously. I enjoyed my food very much it was a good temperate, prepared to cooked but not over cooked \u00a0nicely, and garnished to make me feel like I was at a nice place. I highly recommend this location for breakfast and possibly more. It is on the nicer side and prices are below five star costs but above cheap. I did feel the price was set correctly. My meal ended I paid with a a credit card. Optional tip was included of 12.5%. I like when the receipt explicitly states it is optional. So then it's just convenient. Good experience will try to return but so many more places to try!!! Happy eating",

Well, the food was lovely - the service was shoddy and a bit unprofessional, which was a shame.I had eggs Benedict, and the Hollandaise was exceptional. My dining partner had the Shepherd's Pie and was very happy indeed, but I thought the portion was on the small side. That being said, the eggs Benedict was a large amount of food - and comes with chips - and we couldn't finish it.We also had a couple of cocktails, which were tasty and inventive, but mine was entirely too strong, and despite it not being touched, no attempt was made to rectify it (nor was I even asked if it was okay...)Small niggles in service at a place bearing the Ivy's name is really unacceptable, hence the the lost stars (the waiter brought ketchup when I asked for mayo, scrambled around on the ground to pick up with his hands a container of chips he dropped, argued with me when I asked him to not use the little crumb scraper). It was lovely food though in a pretty setting, and probably worth another go.Brunch for 2 with a drink each and service (which comes on the receipt) was around \u00a355.",

We were originally squeezed into a table between two other couples but asked to move to the little booths adjacent to the bar where we could have a more private conversation. We were easily moved. Food and service was good as usual. Truffle arancini are a must have - they are seriously better than anything I have had in Italy. Salmon main was very overcooked despite having asked for it to be pink in the middle and asparagus slightly hard. That said, the ivy is always a great dinner spot. Loved it!",

The eggs were cooked perfect and super fresh (you can tell by the orange'y yolks), the grilled tomatoes were lovely, the smoked bacon was crisp and salty (and not too smoky), the mushrooms were delicious, and the baked beans were perfect. \u00a0The only thing we didn't love was the sausage, and the black pudding (disgusting... just look up what it is and how it's made).The service was really good and the prices were moderate. \u00a0I definitely recommend.",

They were very busy and asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, but they were able to squeeze us in. My husband and I opted for the full afternoon tea, my mom ordered a salad and my sister ordered a hamburger with fries. All of the food was phenomenal and the service was great. Prices were reasonable as well",

It had a nice old school feel to it with its wood finishings and decor. Decided on the Shepard's Pie, which was a little different from the classic but quite good. The desserts were also very tasty of which I remembered the apple tart the most.",

When we asked for a change, we were moved to a much more comfortable location, perfect for a reunion of old friends that live in opposite sides of the pond. We had lovely cocktails and a very nice bottle of wine to compliment our meal. The scallop appetizer was perfection and quite delicious. The lobster entree was on point . Fortunately, we saved room for desert . The chocolate profiteroles were yummy. We also enjoyed a perfectly prepared creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and lemon pannacotte.",
