    "text": "B was meeting up with her old Uni pals and Bermondsey Street seemed to be the idea place for everyone to congregate without too much transport fuss. A noon meet up was a little bit early for a full blow lunch so the search was on for a suitable brunch spot and after a bit of a google it was decided that Village East would fit the bill. Despite my many wanderings up and down Bermondsey Street I had never paid much attention to this place and was pleasantly surprised when we entered. Lots of exposed brick, wooden floors and designer furnishings make this a deceptively large place which is very easy on the eye. We had a table for five near the entrance which was light, bright and good for a spot of people watching. Our very friendly Irish waitress was chatty and very efficient. Menus soon arrived and a waiter had our glasses filled with water before we had time to even think about drinks; I suspect dehydration may be a problem for many weekend customers at Village East as the waiter seemed to spend most of the brunch session wandering round with his water jug regularly topping up glasses. I'm a bit of late convert to the delights of the Bloody Mary but I am making up for lost time with a vengeance so it was a very well made Village Mary for me while everyone else stuck to coffee. The ladies all went down the traditional breakfast route while I followed Tory Boy's lead and ordered the burger (worried about food envy yet again) which came in just shy of \u00a315. Our orders arrived pretty quickly and the chatter soon died down as we tucked in. Perhaps I have spoilt recently by too many top notch burgers as this one, while being fine did not quite hit the spot \u00a0possibly due to a lack of seasoning and the quality of the beef. The ladies seemed well pleased with their breakfast selections although there was a bit of a grumble about the fried eggs: one over cooked while another was very undercooked. After more chat and a browse through the plentiful supply of papers we were ready for an afternoon stroll along the Thames. If you are after brunch in the London Bridge area you could do worse than Village East \u00a0what the food lacks the staff make up for with their very friendly service.",

It also looked to be a really good place for lunch too, but we didn't stay long enough for that! We were here for a morning meeting and used the room downstairs. It was small but kitted out really nicely with a lovely big table and wooden chairs, and there's a nice screen for those all important presentations. The only food we sampled was the breakfast pastries, which although very unhealthy and definitely not good for the fitness regime, were absolutely amazing \u00a0still warm and some of them stuffed with cinnamon, what more could a girl want! Sister to the Garrison public house up the road, this is a lovely venue and I'll definitely be coming back to sample more of their food.",

The vibe and atmosphere is great- very modern with great decor and friendly and efficient hosts/hostesses and waitrons. The food is always good and quite varied, although it is slightly more expensive than some of the other good restaurants in the area. Nevertheless it is definitely worth visiting for an occasion. I tend to go more often for drinks before I head out for dinner elsewhere. There is normally space in the lovely bar and the cocktails are to die for. I always go for a gin based cocktail with raspberry and cucumber. Ok, it sounds a bit weird but it has such subtle flavours that I can't get myself to order anything else each time I go!",

    "text": "We went here for Sunday Lunch, we had originally tried the Garrison just up the road but that was packed out. Village East was busy but they fit us in. On first thoughts I was concerned that it was a bit too formal atmosphere for a Sunday lunch as has an evening dinner look when you walk in. However, when we walked into the back it was a nice spacious, bright, laid back room with wooden seats and tables. The menu is really imaginative, a range of dishes for all tastes, immediately I realise I could eat everything. There is a good offer of two courses for \u00a314.95 as well on a Sunday. It is a Sunday so I'm craving a roast dinner and opt for the slow roasted leg of lamb. It comes with roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding, carrots, green beans and mint sauce on the side. This is truly one of the best roast dinners I have had outside of my own kitchen. The lamb is tender and delicious, the vegetables taste fresh and are cooked to perfection. I'm not a fan of Yorkshire puddings but this homemade yorkshire was divine. Originally we set out to just have one course, however, the dessert menu lands on our table and we can not resist. After much deliberation I go for the Summer Berry Trifle, it is out of this world, absolutely delicious and wish I could have another! The staff here are extremely friendly and very organised. They have a number of cocktails on the menu as well which looked great to accompany an evening meal. All round a great place and will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "The interior of this place is pucka mucka. It's got two bar areas, two dining areas, an open kitchen and a private dining room. get them, a dining room! One of the bar areas has cool leather sofas, a U shaped bar and is pretty chilled. The other bar does have some cool seating but its a bit more standy, as in people stand.around the massive porcelain bar (a bit like a bog but a lot nicer), there's lots of wooden touches and clever finishes with the exposed vents, tinted mirrors, the lighting and floating music which is never too loud. Its pretty much the only place in the whole area that you can get a decent cocktailin fact its one of the few places you can get a decent drink. Great wine list too. Bar staff are extremely professional, you won't have to wait like a mug for a drink if its busy. Clientelle are very cool, lots of different folk, post-work in the area people, lots of locals, not too trendy, not stuffy at all. The restaurant itself is in two area either side of the kitchen, one area is pretty slick and takes on the the vibe of the rest of the place, the other is bit more low-fi like their other place The Garrison. Food is high quality gastro, it's not that cheap but its no worse than any other top London restaurantand most importantly, food is always delicious. Service is solid. And the wallpaper in the toilets is worth a visit on its own, you always tend to spend a few minutes longer in there than you normally wouldunless you like hanging out in bogs generallyin which case I probably wouldn't advise going to Village East, its an eatery you sicko not a cottage-fest! Is this a normal kind of review? Probably not, but people should make their reviews more like this. Who am I talking to?",

    "text": "I went back to East Village last Saturday to meet a few of my Chilean friends returning from a trip. It was pleasantly busy and buzzing, the staff at the door were friendly and welcomed us upon arrival. It was a good start until we realised that the staff are constantly gossiping and talking horrible things about the customers, some of the things we overheard were truly appalling. However, when it came to the service at the bar (the one up the small stairs), that was slow and quite rude. The bartender served another 2 customers while serving us, then miscalculated the amount due and did not say please or thank you once.When I went to use the bathroom, the toilets were dirty and the had dryer was not working \u00a0despite it only being 9 pm. I thought it would be a good idea to let one of the staff members know about the hand dryer, but the girl I spoke to just said \u00a0oh I see, that happens.We did decide to get some food \u00a0the dishes were tasty, even if slightly overpriced for what they were. The drinks (we had some cocktails and Negronis \u00a0were delicious!). But as we sat at a strangely placed table, we constantly overheard the staff saying horrible things about customers and openly giving an attitude to those they deemed to be as they said 'cheap'. It got quite nasty, so we left because we were aware that probably we will be subject of gossip as well. Shocking staff attitude!",

    "text": "For pictures please refer tohungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  We were actually trying to go to Zucca but they could not fit us in, so we ended up eating at Village East, a trendy cocktail bar/restaurant roughly opposite Zucca on Bermondsey Street. I like going there for cocktails actually, they do unusual combination with herbs (e.g. thyme, sage) and I love their gingerbread old fashioned. I had never eaten there before so it seemed a good idea to give it a try. Can I just say \u00a0the best thing about this whole dinner experience was the service. They were very friendly. They brought me the wrong starter, they did not tell us about the specials and we waited for about 15 minutes for our bill but they were still the best thing by far. Especially as they agreed on accepting our taste London card (50% off food). The whole place seemed strangely soulless and the food was expensive and not good. We started with a small portion of the Village Summer Salad (6.6). A few leaves of tasteless green salad were decorated with a blob of equally tasteless ricotta. There also were some lonely pomegranate seeds and an even more lonely single spear of asparagus. I could not detect any kind of dressing, after I put loads of salt on it was maybe not that healthy anymore but at least we could eat it. Considering that this salad costs nearly 7 pounds it just went straight to the top of my 'worst salads I have ever eaten' list. The other starter, Fig & gorgonzola salad (6.6.) was marginally better in comparison, at least it was not completely insipid (thanks gorgonzola!). But it was by no means a good starter either, they were too stingy on the figs and again I could have done with some kind of dressing. This meal did not start well and it continued to spiral downwards from there. The Black bream fillet (15.9) was maybe the best dish of them all. Having said this, it was overcooked and lacked any sophisticated flavours. The sepia ink around the plate looked cool (the presentation was in general really quite good) but did not add anything to the dish and together with the quite rustic potatoes it all seemed quite random. The real disaster came in the form of veal escalope (17.2). I mean 17 pounds!! For a bland piece of meat with the texture of a shoe sole lying on beans that might be nice if you got them as part of your fry up in the morning when you have a really bad hangover. They should however not be anywhere close to a dish that claims to be part of a 'modern and intelligent' cuisine. And what did they think in putting this celeriac mayonnaise thing on top? I mean really, who makes up these recipes? Apparently someone who should not have become a chef We would have been so annoyed if we had paid full price for the food. Cafe Luc in comparison, where I just ate a couple of days ago and which falls in a similar price category, is million times better and you get what you pay for. I always wondered why Village East was on Toptable (40% off) and Taste London (50% off) \u00a0now I know. No one would ever go there otherwise. For me, even for a quarter of the price, I want to enjoy my food. Village East is a waste of money, time and calories.",

Look I only want pancakes, this isn't The Ivy! We have all too frequently gotten waiter attitude and been left standing at the door of this place, even with lots of vacant tables. I agree with the previous reviewers, The Village East is a really cool place to hit for drinks and I love the industrial interior, reminds me of my ex-apartment in the area. It even gets extra brownie points in my book because they used to host Huddle's Drink Tank, a social networking event for start-ups. But unforgivably, on the weekend when all you want is comfort brunch, you get snotty, I've so above you, waiter attitude.",

Tucked away on a street you'd be forgiven for walking past (I did, got quite lost) when i finally found it, I was greeted by a lovely lady and a really pretty bar. We had dinner in the private room downstairs, not before being led through the entire restaurant (past the open kitchen) and feeling like we were much more important than we really are. nice. Dinner was amazing. I had a few problems with the starter - I asked the waiter if the veal was free range (picky i know) and he forgot to check. When he did check, he couldn't tell me and thought it 'might be organic'. Not the same thing. He then said 'but it's tastes really nice' and i know he was trying to help but it really didn't so i had a lovely Ham hock terrine instead. Everyone seemed to have steak for main which was really brilliant. Perfectly cooked and as it's quite a posh place, i was expecting it to be much smaller. The sides as well mean that a main dish creeps up to about \u00a320, which is a lot, but the food is great. The wine was good, the desserts were brilliant (I managed to have truffles, chocolate fondant AND a tiramisa martini so i can definately comment on how good these are!) I'm never convinced by private rooms in restaurants, and I know it's sensible if there's such a huge group, but other than the bar, I'm not really able to comment on the 'vibe' of the place. I seemed fun though. I like it here. I'm not sure the service was that good - I thought it was a bit slow - in the bar and while we were eating, but I guess there was a lot of us so it's not a huge issue. They do cheaper lunch menus if the a la carte is too pricey and hopefully i'll be back here soon. I really like village east.",

They were arrange and getting people out of the area which I had booked and trying to reserve sufficient space as more of my guests arrived for the party. I had dinner there as well before the drinks. The food was reasonably price; however was a bit disappointing in terms of taste. It was generally a bit salty. Drinks was great and the setting offered a great place for friends to gather and chat. Some of my friends went outside at the entrance for fresh air and it was quite pleasant as wellOn the whole, I would recommend this place.",

They have a different set menu every day - 2 courses for \u00a312 and the main courses are substantial! The staff are also incredibly friendly. This is also a great venue for drinks in the evening and it's really buzzy on a Friday. The bar is separate to the dining area so you can start the evening with a few drinks and then grab a table for dinner. Get there early if you want to get a seat though!",

The pork belly I had for a starter wasn't the best - a little tough, but overall I really enjoyed the food. I really liked that there was a cloakroom and someone to take your coats, I'd agree with comments that the place is upmarket but not too posh. The decor is nice, you can tell they are trying to create a certain ambience and it's a bit edgy. The lampshades seemed quite 1970s to me and a bit out of place, but some people might like that. I thought the tables were a little close together, which means it isn't great for an intimate meal. Also the toilets could do with some sprucing up. The one thing that put me off was the waiting staff, they were kind of hanging around quite close to our table and chatting or they were chatting loudly in another area or they were staring waiting for us to choose our food. I felt a bit uncomfortable, but this could just be me being paranoid/grumpy (I have given this a 4 rating) or because we had taken a really early booking and the restaurant was very quiet. One other thing, the table wasn't ready when we arrived and no-one told us what to do. Gave us the chance to have a cocktail though and that was great.",

My friend really enjoyed his burger (which I believe comes with some foie gras), and my steak bavette was perfectly cooked. I got there around 9pm on a Thursday and the place was definitley happening. Really liked the venue---it has almost a Manhattan warehouse feel to it. The only real con was that the back dining room was quite smokey...clearly they need to invest a bit more in kitchen ventilation. I also agree with teresa L---the kitchen seems to run out of items early on in the night. Other than those 2 items, I would highly recommend Village East.",

Their cocktail menu was impressive and I think I would really like the brunch here, but it ends at 2 p.m. and we had just missed it, so we were stuck with the lunch/dinner menu that is mainly hearty meals or expensive burgers/sandwiches. -Foie gras burger: pricey but delicious. Definitely share-able.-Club sandwich: pretty standard. Overpriced for what it is.-Salads had generous portions and good flavor, but nothing amazing.-Chocolate dessert was overcooked and disappointingI'm hoping if I return I have a better experience as the place looks like it has so much potential. Could've just been bad timing.",

When I ordered a martini the bartender actually did a weird little dance while shaking the shaker from one shoulder to the other, super-serious look on his face. \u00a0It was ridiculous!! (not to mention my confusion on why he defaulted to shaking a martini, did he not know better?)In short, there's nothing really 'wrong' with this place, if cold, urban hipster is your thing. \u00a0VE does it well enough.

Located on the uber cool Bermondsey Street I would probably come here around 3 times a month when I lived in the area. The staff really get to know your face and what drink or food you like which adds a lovely personal touch. The decor is cool and simple; lots of brick with funky lighting and different spaces and loungy corners for those that just want to have a drink. The last time I visited was a Wednesday evening and the place was packed yet they still managed to accommodate my friend and I despite not booking. The atmosphere in the bars was buzzing and the food was delicious. Indeed I have moved but Village East is a good reason for me to visit SE1 from time to time!",

The bar area mixes up original martinis and cocktails, as well as the classics. The drink menu alone is an engaging read. The bar itself is a rustic New York loft-style design. It's minimal, yet inviting. The downstairs bar is the perfect place to grab a drink while you wait for your table or friends to join you. Dining here also lends a bit of the New York feel. I would order almost everything on the menu, but I am a sucker fortheir specials and am rarely disappointed. The whole experience is good from entry to exit. The staff really takes care of you. There are rooms available for private parties and I hope someday to be hosting my birthday dinner there!",

    "text": "Another great find tucked away down Bermondsey street! For ages, this pub has been the landmark I use to find my friend's, Mike L, place. So I thought I'd give it a try one day for brunch with Kate P. Apologies as I'm behind in reviews so this one is an amalgamation of several visits.Brunch was pretty good and especially since we rocked up 30 minutes before they opened (we were early risers and got there at 11) but they still let us come in and sat us down with a cup of coffee for me to nurse my hangover. Definitely plus points in my book. Foodwise, the french toast was crunchy on the outside but soft and gooey with maple syrup on the inside and pretty much everything I could have asked for. Well I could have asked for more bacon but now I'm just getting greedy. The blueberries added a nice fresh tasting accompaniment for the carbolicious meal. I did have a bit of food envy at Kate's eggs royale so may have to go for those next time.On one or more of my subsequent visits, I've gone for a round or two or ten of drinks \u00a0to this quirky pub. Word of advice, book a table or at least get there early. This place gets packed as the after work crowd slowly drifts away from the office. Around 6ish, the place is empty although the bartenders are ready to go so you can order the fancier cocktails and not have to wait at the bar for long. I struck up a conversation with the LA gangs looking bartender who was a great guy. Noticing they have a couple of rye whiskeys on the shelf, I asked him if he knew how to make a Sazerac. He started interrogating me on blends, flavours, types of bitters, and a variety of other factors that go into the art of the Sazerac. I figured that anyone who knew that much probably knew what they were talking about so asked for his recommendation and made my way back with his promise to bring them over.15 minutes later, he shows up with three generous portions in brandy snifters. Aside here, a brandy snifter makes an excellent Sazerac glass as the light almost honeyed tones of the bitters and rye combined are a heady scent. Like me, my friends are not whiskey drinkers and approached the glass with trepidation. But after the first sip, they were converted just as I was after my first Sazerac in Dallas.Village East has the usual bar menus and assortments of wine, but get to know the bartender and find out what their specialties are. I'd bet you won't be disappointed. Think I'll go back tonight.",

    "text": "B was meeting up with her old Uni pals and Bermondsey Street seemed to be the idea place for everyone to congregate without too much transport fuss. A noon meet up was a little bit early for a full blow lunch so the search was on for a suitable brunch spot and after a bit of a google it was decided that Village East would fit the bill.Despite my many wanderings up and down Bermondsey Street I had never paid much attention to this place and was pleasantly surprised when we entered. Lots of exposed brick, wooden floors and \"designer\" furnishings make this a deceptively large place which is very easy on the eye. We had a table for five near the entrance which was light, bright and good for a spot of people watching.Our very friendly Irish waitress was chatty and very efficient. Menus soon arrived and a waiter had our glasses filled with water before we had time to even think about drinks; I suspect dehydration may be a problem for many weekend customers at Village East as the waiter seemed to spend most of the brunch session wandering round with his water jug regularly topping up glasses.I'm a bit of late convert to the delights of the Bloody Mary but I am making up for lost time with a vengeance so it was a very well made Village Mary for me while everyone else stuck to coffee. The ladies all went down the traditional breakfast route while I followed Tory Boy's lead and ordered the burger (worried about food envy yet again) which came in just shy of \u00a315.Our orders arrived pretty quickly and the chatter soon died down as we tucked in. Perhaps I have spoilt recently by too many top notch burgers as this one, while being fine did not quite hit the spot - possibly due to a lack of seasoning and the quality of the beef. The ladies seemed well pleased with their breakfast selections although there was a bit of a grumble about the fried eggs: one over cooked while another was very undercooked.After more chat and a browse through the plentiful supply of papers we were ready for an afternoon stroll along the Thames.If you are after brunch in the London Bridge area you could do worse than Village East - what the food lacks the staff make up for with their very friendly service.",

They had jagermeister, they had red bull, but they don't do jagerbombs. The waiter took about five minutes to apologise and explain that they had all decided on this as a bar policy as its not really a jagerbomb type of place. Fair enough, I thought, you've got to have a system for these types of things, and nice of him to take the time to explain.",

However, I'm grateful my experience turned out to be very different than his/hers! The bar area was surprisingly packed to the hilt given it was a Sunday. Thankfully, we got a table, even if it took the friendly staff a fair amount of time to set it up. We had some difficulty figuring out what we wanted to eat, as I didn't particularly feel like having a burger, fish and chips or anything greasy and fried. Still, the options were interesting. I wasn't too sure what kind of theme they were going for as there were some Chinese-looking options on the menu, but, again, there were also burgers, steaks and other fried options. In the end, I had a chorizo and squid salad as a main. I loved the chorizo (I don't think I've ever encountered a chorizo I didn't enjoy) but the squid just seemed bland. Well, blander than usual. Still, given the limited options we had, and the state of my stomach, it wasn't too bad. I really liked the vibe of the entire bar. It's definitely very cool and trendy, and - thankfully - not posh. It's upmarket, but not offputtingly so. If I'm in the area, I'll definitely pop in and try the cocktails next time!",

There's an open bar in the centre with a few smartly dressed bartenders constantly making drinks. They have a great cocktail menu. I wanted something chocolate-y and the bartender just made something on the spot, and it was super delicious. Definitely order as many drinks as you can because the bar gets so busy and you have to wait to get the bartenders' attention. Around the bar there are little areas to sit, and we finally found seating when it approached midnight when it was less busy. I ended the night with a fruity cocktail and really enjoyed it. It's quite close to London Bridge station so if you're out late there's lots of ways to get home from the area.",

I had the campfire breakfast and my friend got the lobster Benedict - both dishes were tasty and well-done. Runny egg yolk - YUM. They should come with bread though, to sop up the delicious sauces afterward. The quantities are on the smaller side, but the quality justified the prices - not that anything was unreasonably expensive anyway. However - the waiter basically implied that we were fatasses when we ordered a side dish to share. What? (We didn't even end up with that much food...) That's never happened to me before, but then again, in the US you always have the opposite problem with servers trying to foist more food on you. I was just more surprised than offended. We aren't fatasses, for the record.",

    "text": "Went here last night with some co-workers and fell into the oversized leather banquettes lining one wall of the upstairs bar. Do you have any friends who have an impeccable sense of style that is a certain brand of vintage, relaxed cool that would make you kill them in a fit of jealousy if they weren't so nice? That's what Village East feels like. Unfortunately, your friends don't work at Village East. We ordered a round of cocktails and then added a plates of charcuterie (\u00a310) and cheese (\u00a38) because that's what you do when you're with out with a group and see those things on a menu. Everyone's drinks were going down a treat when we saw a man standing near the bar with our food. One of us waved to let him know which table had ordered the nibbles and he looked away. Another person waved with a little, \"hello!\" but he didn't move a muscle. A few minutes later, he put the food on our table saying, \"I was waiting for my colleague as he had the cutlery.\" Way to make it weird, buddy. I think we could have restrained ourselves from digging in mouthfirst and making a scene if you had just come over sans knives and explained they'd arrive in a minute. Eventually we found ourselves with empty glasses so when I saw a man in an apron bussing glasses to the bar I waved, only to be told, \"I'm not service.\" Okay, fine, the bar is only a few steps away and it wasn't really a hassle to place the order for my table, but when I'm paying \u00a38 for a cocktail, I like to feel like people are looking after me. Refilling my water glass goes a long way in my book. After the second round, we moved into the dining room. Service felt slow, but not excruciatingly so. The Marseilles shellfish stew mussels, clams, crab claw, prawns seemed bottomless. Every time I reached my fork in, I found more mussels and clams (there were also two large prawns and a small crab claw). We were all too full for dessert and didn't end up leaving until it was much too late to be out on a Tuesday. I may pop back in, at least for some design inspiration.",

Walked in the other night with a friend and had a great dinner with out any fuss.I enjoyed the relaxed, but not too cool for school atmosphere. Music wasn't alarmingly loud and the lighting was subdued, but bright enough that menus can actually be read. The server was unbelievable kind, helpful and funny, which contrasts with the cold shoulders, couldn't be bothered to crack a smile staff you often get in London. It was one of those dinners where everything worked well. We were given enough time to read the menus, but not left stranded for hours like social lepers. Suggestions and nightly specials were given, but not rammed down our throats as if the fish out back were about to turn. Everything gently flowed from one course to the next until we soon found ourselves back on the street, full, content and slowly waddling home. Well worth coming again.",

Starters for me, a good chopped salad, fairly simple but competent with light dressing. For mains, I tried the beef burger with foie gras and caramelised onions. Ordered medium but was well done but really good and excellent crispy chips on the side. My friends' mains were great too. No room for deserts on this visit.Competent, polite service and efficient operation that is well run and organised and a positive energised atmosphere that provides a light buzz.This was my second visit and just as good as the first.

The drinks were nice, but smaller than I expected. We had dinner and shared two fish dishes, with the crab mac and cheese. The first was a tuna salad, which I thought was nice, but nothing out of this world. The white fish with a pesto sauce and tomatoes was nice, warm, and hearty. I was pretty sad about the crab mac and cheese, because I don't think there was really any crab in it at all. My husband and I came back to try their happy hour, where we sat upstairs. It was nice to be there, but they clearly didn't have enough staff. It took a really long time to pay, and it was difficult to order anything because the poor guy was in charge of the entire upstairs and he was snatched away at every moment. Overall, the experience wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying again. The atmosphere was beautiful, and it's in a really nice location.",

    "text": "Really disappointed by this place after reading so many great reviews. I had a great experience at first ahead of a large party booking - very helpful staff helped us to pre-order our menu, letting us know they would place down name cards for everyone to receive their food smoothly on the night. Sadly, when we got there the staff were extremely disorganised--at first came over to take orders and I had to explain that we'd pre-booked. When food did arrive the staff were all yelling over one another and frustrated by having to work out who's food was who's. As I had paid a deposit upfront, it took a lot of conversations to sort out the bill at the end of the night (despite already having had lots of confusing conversations at the start of the night, trying to avoid that). The fundamental issue was that the staff just appeared completely overwhelmed. I don't know if they were short staffed but we were witness to endless arguing and even crying(!) by the staff, which to be honest just created a really awkward atmosphere over what should have been a fun and relaxing evening. The staff were also really short with a lot of our diners and you were left a bit terrified to ask for anything! Sorry to also say the food wasn't very good, despite being pretty expensive \u00a0: (An overwhelmed waitress did ask the manager to come and speak to me after I had to let her know that two guests had to leave before dessert as dinner had taken so long. The manager did her best to make things better - she took the service charge off our bill and gave us some free Prosecco. I did appreciate this, but tbh we didn't feel great about the staff just not getting their tip (particularly if the issues were caused by how many staff had been put on that night / how they were being organised).I worked hard to find the right place for a big birthday celebration and I really regretted picking Village East. I can't remember the last time I spent an evening in such an unpleasant atmosphere. Needless to say, I won't be going back.",

Pancakes here are to die for! we order both pancakes on the menu, one with bacon and one with berries, they both were so tasty, we also had some chips that were very well cooked and salted. What I really like about here is that the music is not too loud so no need to shout while talking! We had to sit at the bar today which was fine the sits were quite comfy, but if you like to eat at the tables make sure you book before as they are always very busy.I can't wait to go back and try their cocktails next time as they all looked delicious!",

I went for valentines brunch with one of my closest friends for our yearly tradition and damn did this place live up to expectations! I went for the lobster benedict, minus the hollandaise sauce, (because yeah I'm weird) and wow, like an open mouth moment! It was small but every bite was like an explosion of flavour. The lobster, the egg, the soft muffin and the creamed spinach! Completely a knock out dish. To make it better my friend ordered pancakes and I was lucky enough to share some and these were what the word food porn was created for... The clotted cream just melted in the mouth and was complemented by berry compote, which was sweet but not too sweet and fluffy American style pancakes! Literally couldn't have asked for a better sweet breakfast dish...Since I went yesterday, I genuinely have told everyone about how awesome this place is! I'm already planning when I can go back... It's that good!!",

But it might also come down to the ambiance, architecture and of course AMAZING food!An eclectic interior of bare wood, tiled floors & bare light bulbs welcome you into the fray of Village East. They have an ample Breakfast menu and and brunch/lunch menu that kicks off after 11am. Breakfast it was for us for our early start and the selection is really enviable! Avocado, Feta & Poached eggs on Sour Dough with me and a side of chilled grapefruit seasoned with sweet ginger and mint (Yum!). My companions opted for other varieties - from the Village Breakfast (think English breakfast but SO much better) to buttermilk pancakes with crispy bacon and maple syrup. Celebration bubbles aside we also opted for some Bloody Marys (delicious and the right side of spicy) and the Village East special Beetroot Mary (think Bloody Mary but with beetroot juice instead of tomato juice .. I'm a fan!). This was all alongside our coffee addictions (My espresso was served a little luke-warm but the flat whites did not disappoint).Deceptive from the outside, there's ample seating and two decent sized bars which my friends happily informed me you can come visit for some evening tipples (so that's on the To-Do List now). Prices are what you would expect for the area and standard of the place - and we were more than happy to pay! Fantastic happy staff made us welcome and service was prompt.All of the good things basically! If you're after a slightly more 'upmarket' brunch place on Bermondsey Street, Village East is a must!",

So it's probably not the most experimental food but good, heart warming food to keep the hunger at bay without completely killing you. Had the crab bap which was just succulent followed by the panna cotta.3) Entertaining as hell. Went there on a Saturday night, was sat in front of the kitchen and for the first 20mins I don't think I said two words to the boy because we were transfixed, watching the kitchen go. It was so entertaining to see how they put the dish together, the flames and flourishes. Then how they perfect the plate before sorting it out to go to the right place. Really fun to watch.Other reasons this place is super cool: fun looking private dining area, unique bathrooms and great decor.",

Cocktail menu is full of new and exciting ingredients and thus well up my street (nettle cordial this and black cardamom that) whilst the barman put on a good show and seemed to know an unhealthy amount about booze when I asked him a few questions!The ladies on front of house were lovely (though there seemed to be far too many of them) and they soon showed us to our table in the main restaurant. We were looked after really well for the rest of the evening by a very friendly and attentive waitress, who did everything right, apart from convincing my date to pick the wrong starter (she redeemed herself with wine tips though).Having been suitably coerced, we shared the whipped feta and grilled cucumber starter, which was quite cloying and not very nice (and in hindsight, doesn't actually sound very nice). Sadly mains didn't get much better - I decided to try something different and got the soft shell crab bap, which turned out to be a lot of bap, a lot of batter and not much crab. I should mention though that finding the dish quite tasteless may in part be due to my date deciding to spring the 'so where do you think this is going?' chat on me one bite in and I rather lost my appetite :-$I'd go back to give it another try - the place has a fun vibe and is a mishmash of bare brick, leather booths and wood panelling that make it interesting to look at. Next time though I'll either be sticking to the bar or ordering very differently (and hoping for a more successful date!).",

This restaurant is fairly far down along the road that comes from London Bridge, like a good 15 minute walk, but I passed a lot of cool restaurants, bars, and shops along the way.We came for brunch and it didn't seem to be that crowded, with some empty tables around us at peak time. I ordered the lobster benedict, which was a menu item I hadn't seen before, and it was delicious. I don't know how much food they give you with the small portion, but the large one was a good amount and I would definitely have been disappointed with less.My friends had the buttermilk and buckwheat pancakes, which looked good but fairly standard. I don't think they're serving anything mindblowing in terms of brunch food innovation, but the food was very good and the decor is fantastic (and there's no queue).",
