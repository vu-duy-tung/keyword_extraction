Far smaller and more basic than Cafe East, the pho is still stellar and the service is very friendly.We started with the Banh Cuon. Beautiful slippery, textural rice roll goodness. The pho came soon after, I had the rare beef, an oily (in a good way!), complex broth with lot's of herbs to add in. They don't have any tripe or other funny options which is a real shame, when are London Vietnamese restos gonna start offering offal?! I will be back to try more (mainly Bun Bo Hue, \u00a0Com Ga Nuong and Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong) although maybe not for a while, it really is SO FAR AWAY. I also think Cafe East just beats it as my choice of Vietnamese in the area. But only by a little!",

The all-important soup base was good and had a pleasant amount of flavour. This place really fell down on the extras which weren't pho....Crispy springs were dull and not with the nice bubbly traditional roll pastry.....the steamed rolls tasted like a poor meat replacement, though the pastry itself was good. Their version of dipping sauce was neither vinegary enough or fish saucey enough.Service is sketchy, one of the starters wasn't available which we weren't told they bought the starters out. The teapot leaked from the get go and my cold tapioca drink, though delicious and a great cold-coconut compliment to my soup, took forever to arrive. The place was busy throughout our visit and I think that I would return, but only for pho, perhaps the name of the place is representable of the best thing about this cafe.",

Don't let the fact it's deptford deter you, as many yelp reviewers say, this place is a hidden gem of vietnamese hotspots! Not only because it's pretty much the vietnamese equivalent to china town! Mama Pho is one of these gems, it has family links to Cafe East so you can bet your bottom dollar it'll be as good (or so i hear, I need to try cafe east!) Plus you'll have money to bet your bottom dollar on because it is amazingly cheap and cheerful! (Not that I condone gambling!) Deco looks a bit sparse, but you're there for the food, not the paint. Started with Banh Cuon, cheaung fun type starter dish with vietnamese pork! Really good! Then the two massive bowls of Pho and Bun bo xeo. I mean massive. \u00a36.50 each, it was amazing value. The Pho broth depth test was a winner, it just tops the list. Beef wasn't chewy at all either! We also ordered iced coffee, ice lemon tea and two lychee juices. Our bill came to \u00a311 per person! I'm definitely coming back here, especially during the summer because with our condiments plate, there didn't seem to be alot of mint but that might be because it's not in season yet.",

Food: Ban Cuon (rice noodles wrapped around minced pork with sausage and fish sauce) was great to share as an appetizer and very delicious.Pho: Overall tasty but the broth was slightly different from pho we have had in other cities. There was a nice aroma but less flavor of star anise. The broth was also a bit oily but the beef was good. SPECIAL NOTE FOR GREAT SERVICE: The waitress spilled some broth on my boyfriend (which is not typical and has never happened before, according to the manager). She apologized and very generously offered to pay for our ENTIRE meal.But even if there were no spills, the value would have been very good relative to other dinner places (\u00a36.90 for most dishes) and the experience was quick and convenient.",

    "text": "After trying 10+ different Pho restaurants in London, this is by far the best one. The broth is as close as you can get to authentic pho you can get in California (I live there permanently but here once a month). Nice flavor, not too fatty, and the meat is tender and soft.They also serve other Vietnamese delicacies like Banh Xeo and Banh Cuon. Will try those next time but I do see it coming out of the kitchen for other tables as well. The prices are reasonable, and the pho noodle itself is cooked just perfectly (Not too well done, and not too raw where you have to really chew). I'm assuming this is more Pho Bac (Northern style) pho because the pho noodles are wider, no hoisin sauce as a side dip... but a cross culture into Pho Saigon with the healthy amounts of greens for garnishes (sufficient sprouts, & rau hue - basil leaves). \u00a0Fast and expeditious service, but definitely out of the way. Who can say no to some good, authentic, hot pho on a 3 degree night in London?! Holy bajeezus, there's actually something called good Pho in London!. Oh, and catchy name too - sounds like I'm going home to my mama's pho! And then it feels like I'll be washing the dishes afterwards (as the dishes and bowls used here feels like your using your own typical porcelain ware from a Vietnamese home). I'll be back!",

The same family running East run little Mama Pho but they do things in a slightly different way, so one is certainly not the same as the other.After walking south from Surrey Quays station, past the McDonalds we arrived at Mama Pho. A small and basic yellow place that was full of local Viets on a Monday night. We spent only \u00a316 between the two of us to get the spicy chicken salad, the Pho Dac Biet, an iced coffee and a glass of fresh lychee drink. It could wel have been the best \u00a316 meal I've eaten in my life.The chicken salad was densely flavoured, layered with so many different herbs, thinly shredded vegetables and different textures of meat. It was damn spicy too, leaving me gloriously steaming at the end and reaching for my bang tidy iced coffee.The Pho Dac Biet with spicy broth was stunning too (see photo). The whole bowl looked immaculate when it arrived, with the rare beef still bright pink on top, with juicy chunks of flank, yellow-skinned chicken bits and three fat prawns. Add to this some lime juice, chillis and oodles of fresh vegetables and the spicy, deeep Pho was instantly declared the winner of my wife and I's 1-year hunt for good London Pho.So Mama Pho is now in pole position. A bargain, a real find with lovely staff and the best Pho so far.",

My other gripe is their Goi Cuon. It is exact replica of the ones from CE but once again it is not as good. I must say that the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong was really good.

Iced coffee here is refreshing I would highly recommend it.I would say everything on the menu is tasty. Apart from the noodle soups. I find the soup very, very bland. Possibly missing fried garlic? Fried onions, or roasted onion? I dunno. \u00a0But it tastes a lazy chef version of what I'm accustomed to. \u00a0The Thai version is so much more tasty and the broth is rich! Everytime I order the noodle soups here I find it a huge disappointment. \u00a0I've had better. Also annoying how they give you only one tiny piece of napkin. So expect yourself having to ask for more napkins.Simple, professional service, good food, and reasonably priced. But don't disappoint yourself with the soup.",

    "text": "I've been craving pho as the weather gets colder and my friend took me to his go-to spot for dinner, which is Cafe Mama Pho (formerly Cafe East by the same owner). There was a bit of a wait when we arrived but it's worth it.To start, we shared a banh cuon, which are steamed Vietnamese spring rolls wrapped in rice noodle sheets with a minced pork filling. This is a must for us every time we have Vietnamese food. Compared to the ones at Cafe East, the banh cuon here have less filling but they taste mostly the same.For our mains, we both got noodle soups. Most of their main dishes come in two sizes - medium and large. I got a medium pho tai chin, which comes with rare and cooked beef. My friend got a medium bun bo hue, which comes with a spicy broth and round vermicelli. I liked both broths - they were delicious and comforting. What I liked most was that my pho came with different cuts of meat, which usually costs extra to order at other Vietnamese restaurants. The portions were big even for the medium! I was stuffed after this.This is a fantastic place for authentic, affordable and delicious pho. I recommend checking this one out if you're in the area. I know I'm definitely coming back for my next pho fix.",

It has taken over the space Cafe East used to be before it moved. \u00a0Mama Pho has refurbished it and it looks very rustic, wooden tables and benches by one wall and stools, which seems to open up the space which was quite tiny when Cafe East was there, so it feels less cramped, and there is even room for a ledge and stools by the window to eat there. I have still to come across any Vietnamese restaurant that does the summer rolls as good or even better than Cafe East, and oh, the peanut sauce and a spot of chili sauce, for dipping is to die for! \u00a0Nowhere else seems to do this particular sauce. \u00a0At Mama Pho the summer roll came with hoisin sauce for dipping, just not the same. \u00a0Also the summer roll lacked the freshness or tastiness, as there is no vermicelli or mint in the rolls.The raw beef pho was good, but slices are thick and not so tender, and the soup was sweet but just not steaming enough. \u00a0The flash fried well done beef with lemongrass, with vermicelli noodle and salad also tastes good, but the vermicelli was not dry enough, and the beef was not tender enough or well fried.The service was a bit slow. \u00a0Took a bit of time to take our orders. \u00a0We had to ask twice. \u00a0We were eating quite late, around 8.30pm but there were a constant stream of people, and the two waitresses seemed a bit stretched.",

I forgot to take a photo but there was no salad!! But otherwise very tasty if accompanied by the sauce. It was grilled with the successful balance between juicy and charred. 4/5. The beef with rice and salad was even better. Mainly because it actually came with salad so you could actually mix it all together. 5/5.",

But the food was nice and a nice alternative if you find Cafe East is closed (like we did), since they are both not far from each other.The menu has a range of pho and rice dishes, along with a selection of sides. As it is called Mama Pho then it must be about the pho, so I ordered the Pho Chin which had the cooked beef (or well done beef as on menu).The soup I found was bland at first so I added some of the fish dipping which gave it a bit more flavouring. But the cooked beef itself have a lot of flavour which compliment the broth and the pho which lack flavouring. Along with our pho we ordered the Banh Cuon (Vietnamese steamed rolls) and Cha Hue (Deep fried Vietnamese sausage) to share. Both was nice and you could have on its own if you are not very hungry.From the outside it might not have that look that says come in for tasty Vientamese food. But Mama Pho does serve decent Vientamese food.",

    "text": "Thanks to Irene L for organising an outing to deepest ,darkest Deptford on a bitterly cold Friday evening for surprisingly good Vietnamese food. After the 10 minute walk from Surrey Quays station (London Overground), our little band of hungrydiners were relieved to see Mama Pho's bright restaurant lights on the cornerThe first thing which hit me was \u00a0the trail of wonderful aromas when the door opened. Familiar scents of south east Asian cooking started the gastric juices flowing.We were lucky to have Sophie, one of the restaurant's owners, come and explain the menu to us. She confirmed that the dishes are from old family recipes. Home cooking is truly the source of some of the best food in the Far East, so this was a good thing in my bookAs we had 7 diners, it seemed the right thing to order all 7 starters! This gave us a variety of dishes, ranging from a spicy but well balanced vermicelli salad to cheong fun little parcels of beef and mushroom to a DIY lettuce parcel to be self filled with a pancake. It was like eating in someone's home but a home with a great chef in the kitchenFor main course, it had to be the pho. I went for spicy soup and a mixture of cooked and raw beef. Don't be alarmed if you order this and the dish arrives with literally raw beef on top. Just dunk it in the soup and it will cook \u00a0in no time. The soup has tremendous depth of flavour, complex and satisfying. I would say this is the best pho I've tasted in LondonIn the Far East, the best food is usually to be found in smaller establishments and this seems to be true here too. Don't let the word cafe put you off. Come down here for the pho in town",

    "text": "A tiny cafe which is a sister establishment to Cafe East at Canada Water. Mama Pho is a brilliant family-run Vietnamese cafe which serves authentic dishes bursting with flavour. Their noodle dishes are definitely the stars of the menu with both noodle broth and summer noodles equally as tantalizing as each other.The portions are reasonable - large depending on what you order - and at a very reasonable price. It is very achievable to have two drinks and two main meals for \u00a320. Don't expect anything fancy, what you see is what you get but the food is most definitely worth it.The place doesn't serve alcohol but you can BYOB.",

    "text": "Finally made it! Heard so much about this lovely restaurant however never made effort to visit. I have to say I really hope Cafe East could have Mama Pho's starters and to combine the Cafe Easy's main courses together. The starters are a lot more better than the Cafe East, but I couldn't tell difference about the mains. Perhaps it is because the taste are so close and Mama Pho is a bit distant so that most ppl go to Cafe East. I found the lovely sausage which Cafe East stopped serving years ago, it is very authentic indeed!",
