    "text": "It saddens me to give such a low rating to Jamie Oliver's restaurant since I love his TV shows, but the food experience was disappointing...We went there for lunch, no reservation but managed to get a table within 5min.The restaurant itself is nothing special, a bit uncomfortable chairs, but overall OK.Service, again OK... We did ask for our wine for a couple of times since they kept forgetting...And now to the food... The main reason we decided to go.Starters were great... Garlic bread and two types of bruschetta: italian pate and crab meat with avocado. Very good.Mains, on the other hand, were a disaster... I had one of the specials: home made spaghetti with mussels and different fish... The pasta was overcooked and I suspect it was plated for some time since it was just a ball of pasta that did not came apart. I tried to aerate it, but with little success. Then the taste... It was supposed to have all that fish and seafood in a white wine sauce with garlic and chili... But it had salmon, which overpowered everything. All I could taste was pasta with salmon... Which had nothing special. My other friends had the burger (which was very well done... The waiter never asked how he wants it cooked) and his with penne all'arrabbiata... First time that she ever sent a plate back... The pasta was, again, overcooked but it also had a strange aftertaste... We all tried it and came to the same conclusion... To give them credit, they did remove it from the final check, but still, we had much higher expectations from Jamie's restaurant",

    "text": "It is debatable if Jamie's Italian is in fact Italian. It may have all the key ingredients, but is the prep and execution the same? Ask most Italians and they will say no. Try authentic Italians like Amici Miei (my fave), and you see a noticeable difference. That said, when you are in town for the theatre, you are limited to where you go before the curtain calls. The food was passable. The garlic prawns to start, were lacking in meat and heavy on the garlic. The crispy squid was okay but a bit stingy in portion size. For the main course, surprisingly where they get it right is the non-Italian Burger. My bae thought it was really tasty. I had the spaghetti with crab which had a lot of shells. Nowt worst than crunchy bits. The service was quick as I have a feeling they are used to this conveyor built service of rotating door tourists and theatre goers. This also showed in the service which was more about getting the deed done, than forming any kind of warm customer service. I would not come here again by choice.",

The salads came out right behind the pasta. We asked to take the pasta dish back so we could eat the salad since it was the starter. Both dishes would not fit on small table at same time so they took pasta dish back and 2 seconds later another waiter comes out and asked if there was a problem . We said both dishes will not fit on table so could you take back the pasta dish. He then said we would have to toss it out and that is not good. We would have to hold pasta in hand while eating salad. I just said nothing after that he took pasta back and when finished with salad they brought out pasta dishes back. Yes the same pasta dish that was sent out 20 plus minutes earlier. It was cold not good and waiter never came back to ask how dinner was. The food was terrible and boring. Not a lot of flavor. It is \u00a0just not the quality you would expect from a Jamie Oliver's restaurant. Jamie needs to check up on food quality and better training of staff. I see other Jamie's restaurants don't score well either. My suggestion so many other good restaurants with better service and food. Just because it says Jamie's doesn't make it good...",

Finally the cheek to ask for more tips after the 12,5 % sercive fee added to our bill was a bit too much considering that the waitress should have listened to the nursery rhyme of turning a frown upside down..

They dressed it up a bit but didn't change it to the point where you can't tell.You can tell. And that's okay.Everything that everyone ordered looked like something I'd have wanted to eat. That doesn't usually happen. In particular, the canneloni looked legit. I had the chicken breast. It was very good...but that's a super boring choice. My fault there. But, it was one of the only meals that I knew was gluten free. So, not my fault. And shame on you for just judging me there.The price wasn't bad. The location is convenient, albeit near touristy. A few people at the table said they'd come back. They probably don't use Yelp though, so you're never going to hear it from them on here. Hence...me. Telling you.You're welcome.PS the bathroom is five hundred miles away. It's so far that I felt like I had to tell everybody so they didn't think I left partway through dinner to do anything other than pee. Hate it when the bathroom is so far away it stirs up the imagination of your fellow co-diners. That's imagination wasted. I'd rather they used it for something else.

Eh what the heck... My experience here ended up being a total surprise!! The food was absolutely delicious!!! The interior is very roomy with 3 floors!! We ordered the squid ink pasta and the mushroom fettucini, the pasta was homemade and jamie oliver's use of different spices in his dish added depth to a simple pasta dish. \u00a0Who would have thought a celebrity chef chain restaurant could be this delicious! I wish he opens one in NY!!!Overall if you are a tourist like me and not too familiar with the city and dont know what to eat on your first or second day in the city, jamie's italian is a very good choice!

The chips were done to perfection, though the portion was small. The slaw was one of the worst I've ever had. What looked like good purple cabbage badly prepared was rough to eat, with no recognisable dressing. Flavourless and nearly inedible. The steak was positively swimming in butter, with a big herbed glob on top. I had to scrape it to side and dab each morsel on a clean part of the plate. It was so heavily dressed the flavour of the meat was lost in it. Not worth the money, and sorely disappointing. The rather grumpy waiter only came alive when I tipped him 20%. I would have appreciated a friendlier attitude before and during the meal, not after. He appeared to assume I was a tourist because of my accent, which I am not.

I booked a table online for lunch at 12pm and noted that the website (and the online booking system) claimed that it opens at 11am. I turned up at 11.50am and was met by a blank stare telling me that they didn't open until 12pm and so I couldn't sit down until then. I'm really not sure why, as the tables seemed to be there, ready and available, but I was made to wait in the bar area until 12.03pm. Not the most customer-friendly start! So we were shown to our table for two - I suppose there is always the trade off between giving customers enough personal space and making a profit for the restaurant by getting more tables in. It felt that the profit won that battle hands down. The service was somewhat brisk and cold, but it was efficient. I ordered the Caprese salad (large portion) and my friend ordered the prawn linguine (small portion) with a side salad. I got a bowl of mozzarella and tomato with some ham and olive oil - exactly what was advertised. The only thing is that the tomatoes didn't really taste of anything, there was a smidge too much oil and the dish was about ten quid, so it didn't feel like I had really got my money's worth. My friend's pasta was fine, the coffee we had afterwards was ok, (they only serve full fat milk which ruined it a bit), but at 22 quid a head, it felt like it was on the steep side for the experience, which frankly wasn't as warm, inviting or tasty as pizza express! If you are in the area and need lunch, try Brasserie Zedel instead.",

We dressed up for the occasion but obviously Jamie's Italian is quite casual and this branch in particular seems to be a former pub so it's down-to-earth, with lots of dark wood. The friendly waiter asked if we wanted any starters and brought us two choices without waiting for us to choose. On the one side, that was quite charming and refreshing but on the other hand it could have gone wrong too. He brought us green olives on ice and fried ravioli with a tomato dip. Both starters were creative and delicious. Our mains, pasta dishes, were good aswell but didn't pop my cherry. For dessert I think we shared a Sicilian Lemon Cheesecake which we didn't even finish and that's why my review is just A-OK. I would have wished that all courses had withheld exciting surprises like the starters did.",

    "text": "*****VEGETARIAN*****I have long theorised that some chefs excel (only) at cooking certain ingredients, not dishes. I am slowly coming to the conclusion that Jamie Oliver is one of these, at least judging him by his restaurants. The good new is that he seems to excel at all mushroom dishes. I have never had a bad mushroom dish here, and his use of porcini mushrooms and truffles is well thought and nuanced. However, most other veggie dishes seem bland and standard in comparison.The desserts are worth a shout tho!Prob the best thing about this particular spot is the bar - its a great spot for soho and very stylishly designed.",

    "text": "My friend had her birthday dinner here the other night, for a group of 14. This is a chain all over London, but it was my first time, and it reminded me of those chain Italian restaurants we have back in America- like Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory. She ordered some starters for the table- surprising that you have to pay for bread at an Italian restaurant! We also had some bruschetta and meats and cheese, which were nothing spectacular, really. But the oddest thing was my pasta, which was the Vongole Tagliolini. It was spicy with an overdose of pepper, which is a very weird taste for a pasta dish. I also ordered a small dish but they gave me the large instead. One thing to note: the house red wine, Jamie's Rosso, is quite decent. Overall I'd say this place is good for groups, but when you have so many other and better options in Soho, there's not much else reason to come back.",

They were very hard to chew, and the portion was extremely big as well.The liver main course was okay, with very heavy smelling and tasted very raw, ppl love liver would probably like it.It took so much time to waiting for the main, and we don't have to try desserts at all.Will not go there next time:S",

    "text": "I think, for the name and the price and the location, it was just passable.A colleague and I went there for lunch. We had the vegetable plank for two as a starter and the mushroom risotto as a main. I thoroughly enjoyed the starter. The various vegetables, cheeses, etc. were all really tasty.Frankly mushroom risotto is a pretty predictable offering for vegetarians, so no points for thinking that up. The risotto itself was a bit gritty and not the texture I expected. It had some nice mushrooms, but not an overwhelming number.To be fair, we ordered coffee after lunch and the coffee was really fabulous. Something to write home about. I think the problem with names like \"Jamie Oliver\" and in particular, this place where they're throwing around terms like \"flagship\" restaurant, it sets your expectations pretty high. Three stars under these circumstances would probably be 4 stars elsewhere. But what I got here was just three stars given the expectations.Given the price we paid (\u00a370 for lunch when all was said and done), I'm going to look elsewhere before I come back here.",

Turkey was just a flat Turkey Kiev kinda thing with a bit of cheese inside and an egg on top, oh and a tiny bit of truffle. \u00a0Like I said, PASTA was GREAT. Mains are sad. For desert I ordered 2 sorbet (mango and lemon) and 1 caramel ice cream scoops, which were nice, but not the greatest for Italian cuisine.Atmosphere was very nice but our table was next to a wardrobe with cutlery and the till so the staff were making LOTS of noise and kept bumping my chair which was quite annoying.

The attire is definitely casual, so fear not if you want to just pop in for a bite. The garlic bread was a work of art with its presentation (on top of being delicious!). The spicy arrabbiata was excellent, but not for the faint of heart when it comes to spice. There were thinly sliced habaneros on top, so be sure you really like hot foods before ordering. The tagliatelle bolognese had a deep, richly flavored meat sauce. You could tell this sauce had been simmered for hours. Also, the pricing was reasonable considering the location. Great experience, awesome food!",

We ended up waiting an hour and fifteen minutes before we were seated. During that whole time the hostess never attempted to contact us, apologize, or reassure us about the wait time. After finally being seated, we waited for a period of time as waiters ignored us and avoided making eye contact. Finally after waving wildly, our waiter named Bruno came over. We were concerned when he didn't take any notes for an order of 5 people (including appetizers, drinks, mains, and even allergy information). Of course, he made several errors. I ordered a glass of red wine. He gave me a glass of white. He also completely forgot my appetizer. Not once did he come check if we were satisfied with our meal. It was unbelievable. He also brought another person in our group's meal after the rest of the table had finished. He never apologized. Most of the time we could see the waiter hanging out with his friends or flirting with another waitress. The food was mediocre. The purpose of my review was to admonish the service. Don't make the mistake of stumbling in hungry to Jamie's Italian.",

    "text": "Came here with my cousin as he was in town. We went on a Wednesday night in mid August and I had booked a table for 2 at 7pm on Open Table.I was really shocked by how busy it was! The waitering staff had only been able to prepare our table 15 minutes late, which didn't bother me as it's completely out of their control. What was great was that the host was very friendly and communicated with me and acknowledged that they were running late. He had a sense of urgency but was very friendly. Thumbs up to you sir!For our starter, we had the meat platter on the plank. It was okay, but difficult to eat on such a small table. They had brought out 2 cans to rest the plank, but this made things difficult to serve yourself. It was a small table, and it needed to fit both of our plates, silverware, the meat plank, garlic bread, my cousin's mojito, 2 water glasses and a bottle of sparkling water! If you can imagine, it was like trying to play jenga with your food!Garlic bread was okay. Warm toasted white bread slathered in butter always tastes great, you know...For my main, I had the squid and mussels pasta. Which was really tasty. I've never had squid ink pasta, but it was wonderful. Al dente and super tasty. I would totally look into ordering this again, or making it myself: jamieoliver.com/videos/l\u2026The only downside is that I didn't have a bowl or anything to put my mussel shells in. Which made me quite embarrassed to put them directly on the table. However, there wasn't any room on this tiny table for a shell bowl!All in all, if you are looking for a relatively low-moderate priced place, with great service, above average food that would be difficult to make for yourself at home with small tables, this is a place for you. I would probably come back again if I was looking for something a bit more upscale than a Pizza Express, but not as flashy as Bocca Di Lupo.",

Nice restaurant and Terrasse, basically it's an old reconverted pub. The service was great and the food too! I like the trendy/smart casual style of the dishes and the great service. We went for starters and main but couldn't go for a dessert (we were so full). I will definitively go back to Jamie's Italian!!!",

    "text": "Totally happy with this place.We were a party of six Americans in town for a little business and a little fun. We visited at midday on the Sunday before the May Bank Holiday. I checked the online reservations and there was nothing available for a party of our size for another 90 minutes, so I was thrilled when we turned up with no reservation and were seated right away. I should say I directed our group to this location instead of the one at Covent Garden because I suspected this might happen. Glad I was right!We started with the arancini margherita, Italian nachos, and something else that apparently wasn't worth remembering (I went back and checked the menu; it was bread). We ended up ordering a second arancini because they turned out to be so delicious.I stuck with the simple penne pomodoro for my main. It was exactly the kind of comfort food I was craving. The breadcrumbs added a nice texture.The vegetarian in our party had the gnudi and loved it. It was quite rich; the smaller portion size was plenty.My husband went with the crab spaghettini and deemed it \"too fishy.\" Maybe it was the anchovies?A couple of burgers and a steak rounded out our group's selections. They cleaned their plates, but they also didn't write letters home about them. Perhaps they should have stuck with pasta.We put dessert in our waiter's hands, and he returned with an enormous wooden plank bearing four desserts: the epic brownie (demolished), tiramisu (even my tiramisu-hating husband had to admit it was good), macerated strawberries (a surprising favorite!), and the raspberry pavlova (the only one with anything left on the platter). I still can't get over how delicious those strawberries were.The service was good, the food was hot and fresh, and the atmosphere was pleasant. All in all, it was a great choice for lunch on a beautiful day, and it helped me keep American tourists out of McDonalds. Win-win!",

We looked at a few menu's and thought that the Italian place would be great.There is a theater right across the street and we were able to get tickets for the next show. That escalated the urgency of making a choice for dinner since now that there was a clock running against us and we have approximately one hour for dinner. We dashed into Jamie's and were immediately pleased with how quickly we were seated and served drinks. The food was also fairly quick, was steaming hot and looked and smelled great. I had the seafood pasta and Isabel had the pasta with meatballs. All conversation stopped when we each took our first bite. After a full day of touring around London we were tired and hungry, and my delicious seafood pasta had my full attention. This was one of the great meals that we enjoyed while visiting.Quantity and quality of the meals was excellent. The staff was attentive and quick. The SoHo location is perfect if you have business in the area or are just exploring like us. We absolutely recommend Jamie's if you have the opportunity to enjoy a meal there.",

The meatballs were ground beef with no seasoning...maybe other meats in there but a disturbing flavor. The pasta in both meals were under done at best. It was overall a low point for the evening.

Besides the diarrhea we had to experience this awkward moment between the host and waiter when they were disputing about where to seat us. I ordered the two course meal. I chose the Fritto Misto for the starter and the Italian Steak and Fries for the main course. The Fritto Misto which consists of light battered fish and squid was very salty. For the main dish the steak was overcooked. The seasoning was well but the meat was not tender at all. I've been to Jamie's in Reading before and had a much better experience. The food at that location was excellent. It's unfortunate that the quality is not consistent in every location.",

Not sure if the restaurant is more causal like this or it's just me feeling not too professional regarding the service. The food tastes ok. Not too impressed... the sauce was a bit watery (not in terms of flavor but more like consistency). I prefer a bit thicker consistency so it feels like the sauce hugs the pasta with its flavor better. Overall Its good to try but I probably won't come back.

Good flavor on the chicken not very lean. Homemade croutons.Sauce lacked a distinctive and rich taste, and the absence of parmesan made the meal overall not that flavor-filled.6/10- Garlic Bread.
