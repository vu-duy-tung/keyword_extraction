    "text": "This rating is a very tough call for me ... between 3 stars and 4.First of all, what My Old Dutch serves is not really pancakes, but they are more like crepes. But they do it very well. They have a variety of sweet and savoury alternatives to choose from. On both the occasions that i have visited, it had been for dinner and so i had given the sweet stuff a miss. I have tried the chicken with rice, and the Moroccan lamb stew. Both were fabulous. However the rice that came with the chicken crepe was too dry, and frankly unnecessary. The portions are really big ... and they come in huge plates that cover half the table. It reminded me of the way Ethiopian injera is served. If you are really hungry, one would be good enough ... else, try to share with someone else.I have tried the milk shakes here. They are quite nice (and expensive, at \u00a34 each). But they provide a tumbler full of shake, which will surely last you the entire meal.Even though the food is good, the service here is not up to the mark. The place is very popular and so frequently customers have to queue. But nobody comes to tell you how long the wait is likely to be. In fact, i didn't find anyone even acknowledging our existence until a table was free. They asked us whether we would like to share a table. We didn't mind. But they shouldn't have suggested that if it meant we had to get up every time access was needed to the other group using the table.The crepes generally cost about \u00a39-\u00a310 each, but they have a special Monday offer when they are priced at only \u00a35. That makes my old dutch exceedingly cheap on the day. It wouldn't be my first choice for a dinner out on a weekend, but on a monday it will be right up there in the list of alternatives :)",

The service was efficient and friendly, but the pancake I had was pretty mediocre.I had the Amsterdammer pancake which is made with sauteed apples, smoked bacon and maple syrup. Unfortunately every component was a disappointment. The apples were bitter and chewy, the bacon was fatty and completely devoid of flavour (I'd question if it was really smoked), and the maple syrup was actually cheap generic pancake syrup, no different than you'd get with a Mc Donald's pancake. At \u00a37.95 and nothing to be happy about at all, it felt like a con.The chocolate milkshake was considerably better, made with loads of ice cream and served with extras in the blender tin, but it wasn't enough to rescue their main dish, and supposed speciality, and I left disappointed.",

The decor is simple and plain, but the enormity and exciting of the pancakes certainly makes up for it.The menu consists of savoury and sweet pancakes (at an additional cost you can also choose to have extra toppings) traditional Dutch starters and a range of desserts. There is an eclectic choice of flavours to choose from the savoury pancake list such as chilli con carne, chicken curry, smoked duck and smoked salmon. In this case I prefer the simpler option of creamed spinach and cheese (with some added smoked bacon). For the sweet pancake option, again I usually go for the more toned down choices such as the one with sugar and lemon, or maple syrup and butter.As already stressed, the pancakes are large, and believe me you will easily be more than full after eating it. I suggest going halves with someone, maybe sharing a choice from both the savoury and sweet pancake option, therefore you get to enjoy both types.",

Which is why seeing the glorious pig straps as an option of pancake filling drew me to My Old Dutch. A quaint little place nestled in the bustling High Holborn, this famous pancake house has choices that would satisfy even the most adventurous of foodies. Fancy chocolate chip with chocolate sauce or warming apple cinnamon? Go to My Old Dutch. Have a hankering for chilli con carne, halal lamb stew or chicken curry in your pancake? My Old Dutch. Fancy an old wellington boot on a plate? No. Go away. There's something for everyone, whether you're on a diet and fancy a salad instead (though, why you're in a pancake house, I can't fathom...), or whether you're Gluten Free. Unless you go for a Lite Bite or surrender to the good old Doggy Bag walk of shame, I would suggest building up a large appetite, as these pancakes are huge. As much I had to battle my way through the thing (Kaysha doesn't waste food), I would definitely visit again, if not to try their all new Butterscotch range, then to sample as many of their fruit beers as socially acceptable in one sitting; because where else can you find cherry, mango, banana, peach, strawberry or passion fruit beer all under one roof? Anyone who can answer this question, I will love forever. Genuinely.",

On reading many many yelp reviews, a friend and I decided to share one savory and one sweet, and it was a good idea, by the time we got to sweet, we didn't even finish. But only the portion sizes were impressive. Flavours weren't too great. The smoked salmon and mushroom was really creamy, not sure if it worked that well though. The berry compote was a bit tart. (The whore!) Remember my story about the giant scone at Camelia's Tea House. This is his relative- the giant pancake. Also, try to go with less people? There's always a queue on mondays. so be prepared to wait!",

It's just like I participated...All that running works up an appetite so good thing these pancakes are HUGE. and generously filled with all kinds of goodies. The kinds of things you would never dream would be good in a pancake but kind of are. Some of the ingredients aren't the best and it seems a bit overpriced (except on Mondays, then it's a steal!), but it's good wholesome food.On this occasion we sampled 3 savoury pancakes between 4 to have room for pudding (because how can you not leave room for a sweet pancake!) - the smoked salmon was okay but overdid the cream sauce, the lamb stew works really nicely with the sauce but the lamb is a tad tough and the smoked duck was the star of the show here with hoi sin. Possibly because I love the flavour of duck & hoi sin, but it worked really well with the pancake base to mop up the remaining sauce.Puddings are a standard, I would recommend apple & cinnamon to give you a warming feeling that I expect with a pancake. Staff are a bit forgetful unfortunately, but I like the loyalty card of getting a pancake free after you buy 9 (in a group, you do that pretty quickly, we had 6 in one sitting!)",

I ordered nachos for starters and trust me the bowl was huge and filled with nachos mixed with melted cheese and topped with sour cream, gaucamole, and hot salsa. Salsa would be mild if you are of indian origin. The collection of drinks are also amazing, from wheat beer to hot chocolate. A three course meal at. This place would be a feast and i totally feel that it is value for money. Quality food at affordable prices with friendly staff. Try the rich sundaes if you have some space left in your stomach after hogging the pancake. You wont regret.I ordered a bowl of nachos, hot chocolate and greek pancacke. It was quite a large meal so I couldn't finish it from there. But I don't like wasting food, so I asked them if they could pack it up for me and they did. And just had it now. It still tastes delicious. If you are starving then this place will fill you up.",

First, though the place was busy, it was easy to get a table and be seated. The food was delicious, and the style of 'pancake' was novel and kept well as take away. I also had soup, which warmed my heart and was a vital step in a particularly brutal hangover cure, and was pleased with it after having been caught in the rain. However, the timing of service was a little bit strange. I ordered soup while my friend ordered coffee. Her coffee came out alone, then her pancake and my soup, and finally my pancake came out after everything else was done (I asked for it just to be wrapped for take away). The timing of 'courses' was a little illogical then, as my friend started out before me and I would have ended well after. Other than that though, I found my savory pancake very tasty (as take away) and the service was good. I'd recommend My Old Dutch for a good Sunday brunch, any day of the week.",

It's a GODSEND for the student budget!The 7 of us were seated quickly (we went around 5:30pm, before the huge dinner rush) and it was rather difficult to decide what to get. A friend and I decided to split a savory one and a dessert one. We ordered the My Old Dutch and the Berries Compote with ice cream. Our food came out within 15-20 minutes and all of us started chowing down. Since our dessert pancake (if you're from the US, think crepe, not pancake) had ice cream, we had to eat that one first. The ice cream balanced out the tartness of the berries; it was a healthy dessert =) The My Old Dutch was delicious as well. By the time I reached 3/4, I was starting to find it difficult to eat any more, but it was so good I finished it all. The amount of food you get for \u00a35 makes it worth it. There are so many different combinations; I'd really like to go back again next week to try a different pancake.",

Service wise, it has been the best I have gotten in London, but I can only imagine that when you are the only customers in the whole restaurant (and I was with my pretty friends) they can't miss you on the attention scale. Unlike all our other brekkies, I didn't visit the website before hand to figure out what I wanted which was a fail as I went back and forth between sweet and savoury with 2 waiter visits. *embarrassing Ended up ordering the Greek pancake as I was in need of feta. It was HUUUUUUUUUGE. I was sadly not warned about this, and had no time to do my stomach expanding breathing before hand. It was quite tasty and I must go again for the sweet.

With the right ratio, you begin to get customers giving you money, so you can expand the space and hire more people. If you expand the space and put in too many tables and chairs, but not enough servers or cooks, the people will come in, sit down, grumble about the wait time, and leave, and eventually no one comes to your restaurant.Our experience with the Old Dutch Pancake House was a bit like that. We walked in with no one in the restaurant, to a whole restaurant full of people and no one had food, for a long time. And then eventually, the food started to come out, and ours was not there (the best part is probably that all we ordered was waffles and ice cream). After some complaints, the food eventually came, and the manager apologized several times and comped us the meal.The waffles were alright. Hard to go wrong with those. I watched the other people eat their giant pancakes and wished i had ordered these.Would I come back? Yes. Hopefully the owner/top management will play some restaurant city and figure out how it works \u00a0so that the service will be faster.Oh and the ambiance is quite adorable. I am really looking forward to coming back.",

The location is great - close to Holborn station and not a very far walk from Oxford Street or the Bloomsbury campuses (if you're a student like me). I've come here a couple times to try different flavours because they have such a huge menu! If you are looking for American style fluffy pancakes then get the Butterscotch ones. They come in five regular sized stacked pancakes, topped with powered sugar and whatever topping you chose. The chocolate chip pancakes I ordered were super sweet and very filling! The other pancakes are more similar to a crepe, thin and easily folded. They are seriously gigantic and you need to be very hungry to finish the whole thing! But a bonus to these is the lovely dutch painted plate they serve it on :) Service was fine, nothing spectacular but not too bad. The pancakes are definitely the main reason I come here, so many options and delicious every time!",

The shakes are also terrific like the vanilla one. Very simple and not too sweet.I highly recommend this space for a fairly inexpensive breakfast. Oh and students get 10% off so bring ID cards!",

    "text": "This place was HORRIBLE and knows nothing about customer service! I went there on my own while visiting London in February. I was seated downstairs and it took a little bit for my waiter to come. I decided to build my own so I asked for pear, bananas, nuts and caramel. My order came out covered in powder sugar and after taking a picture I started eating it. Being delirious after a red eye flight and traversing around england I kind of zoned out while eating until I realized the pancake crepe was tasting weird. It had a VERY eggy taste to it and as I looked at it closer it was very yellow. The bananas were clearly not ripe when they were cut as they tasted like plantains instead. The pears were HARD and the caramel sauce tasted more like dulce de leche. As I looked around at the tables next to me I noticed that everyone else had a thin off- white pancake while mine was a egg yolk yellow pancake the consistency of a spongy american pancake. When you flipped over the banana the batter hadnt cooked properly anthehere was also runny batter inbetween the pears being covered by the powdered sugar. Disgusted and feeling slightly nauseous I called over a waitress and showed her what I had in front of me and her response was \" You should have told me before you started eating it.\" I told her I didnt realize before since it was presented all nicely. She said she would talk to the manager after I insisted that something had to be done. After 10 minutes she comes back and says \"sorry theres nothing we can do.\" They very clearly gave me food that was undercooked and was noticably NOT the kind of pancakes they serve there and yet still had the gall to serve it to me AND insist I had to pay! Horrible customer service, horrible \"pancake\" which is realistically more of a crepe. They should have inspections and go out of business. I would never recommend a place of business that operates the way they do. Apparently its all about the money for the owner. Disgusting.",

It is a unique, inexpensive, casual restaurant that serves what Americans would call crepes. Just go with a friend so you can order one savory and one sweet and split them. They are huge so you will not walk away hungry. The service is often slow, especially if they are crowded, but the restaurant is convenient to get to as it is right across the street from the Holborn tube station and walking distance from Sir John Soanes and The British Museum. This facility \u00a0can accommodate large groups in the basement if you call ahead. On Mondays most of the pancakes are only 5 pounds and If you sit up near the front window, you can watch the world go by as you enjoy your unique and delicious meal.",

When they came out, it was so surprising because my friend's was a stack of maybe 4 small pancakes, and mine was a humongous thin crepe. They were so different! Nevertheless my friend's sweet pancake and my savory pancake were both very delicious, and we thoroughly enjoyed them. We also both got milkshakes, which were thick, sweet, rich, and everything that makes life wonderful. I can't wait until I get to come here again!",

I was expecting something similar to IHOP in the states, with huge stacks of pancakes covered in maple syrup and garnished with bacon. But it was much more interesting than that, they had a large range of savoury pancakes as well as the sweet and the butterscotch. The smoked salmon with mushroom and dill sauce that I chose was lovely and an overly generous portion size for the prize.The decor was nice enough, nothing to complain or rave about and everything was clean. All of the staff were very friendly and attentive as well.I'll definitely be back again (the queue for a table suggests this is a common feeling)",

He took it on-board, and then said we could have a \u00a0free pancake..so we had desert pancake to order (which did have milk in the gluten free mix) and it was really really really good..

When the pancake came, I was in shock to see how huge it was- it was almost the size of a small puppy or something :x not that I didn't enjoy the huge portions or anything.... The sweets lover in me still ate the whole thing LOL. The pancake was delicious, it had blackberries, strawberries and raspberries in it.

    "text": "I've probably been to Old Dutch enough times to know their menu by heart. First up, on Mondays are \u00a35 for all pancakes. When I say pancakes, these are gigantic crepes with toppings (Dutch style). When I say enormous, I mean enormous. Too many friends have scoffed when I tell them how big a pancake is and been defeated. So work up an appetite before you go.You can get either savoury or sweet pancakes and there are a good list of choices for both. The salmon one is my personal favourite - smoked salmon, creamy sauce and mushrooms. The sauce is rich and delicious and they don't scrimp on the salmon you get. Probably the most filling pancake. The seafood one is a close second. It's closer to a seafood pizza on a crepe with a tomato base and topped with cheese and prawns, anchovies and capers. Might sound a bit weird but it works, trust me! As for sweet pancakes, the berries one is OK. The berries can be very acidic sometimes which can make it quite unpleasant. They don't taste very fresh either. The banana and chocolate one is a better choice IMO. You are given the chocolate sauce to drizzle yourself and these are classic flavours which you can't really go wrong with. Atmosphere wise, it's a cute restaurant with a very strong Dutch theme - think windmill plates and tulip motifs. It does get very busy on Mondays thanks to the offer so expect a queue in the evenings.",

And were seated and served quickly but not rushedInside the decor is a bit crap but bright and cleanMenu is massive with some different filling! Bf and I shared a savoury crepe - Mexican one with chilli, guac and sour cream and nachos on the side. It was actually really tasty and went so I would be brave enough to go for something else savoury next time as wellwe both got American pancakes with different sugary sweet toppings for pudding, chocolate fruit etc and they were tasty but not amazingThe price is really the draw back along with a pancake is a pancake! Nothing special but fun and good for the occasionWon't go any other time of the yearWould like to go back another shrove Tuesday and sample some more of their savoury combos however at \u00a310 a pancake it is a bit much! Fun and would recommend!",

The idea of savoury pancakes was introduced to me a few years ago and this place does not disappoint.It is located very close to Holborn station and inside jt boasts enough tables to cater for the lunchtime rush and the after work crowd. \u00a0Furthermore they have a great deal on Mondays with pancakes mostly at a fiver a go. \u00a0As well as savoury for the sweet tooth folk out there do not fear, My Old Dutch have not forgotten about you, boasting a huge selection from Nutella pancakes to classic with whipped cream and fruit it is amazing. \u00a0They have good milkshakes however they are not any different to milkshakes available at most similar establishments.I had a duck pancake with a Nutella milkshake. \u00a0Both arrived very quickly and came in under \u00a315. \u00a0I thought it was well worth the money and definitely filling. \u00a0My friends had various pancakes differing in size and toppings, my favourite was a fellow diner who had obviously done his research and gone for a sweet option. \u00a0The great thing as it is cheap, good location you can always go back for more and try all the items off their extensive menu, especially if you go on Monday Madness!",

It was quite nice, fresh spinach and red onion. Plus 2 runny eggs. The portions are huge!! And I barely ate half of it, as you can see from my picture. I don't think it helped that I had a gluten free pancake which seemed much thicker than my friends. Great that they do gluten free though.I was really put off by the toilets in this restaurant. They smelt bad, weren't clean and had no working hand dryers. Hopefully the other restaurants in this chain are better maintained as I would like to go back and try \u00a0some sweet pancakes!",

Ever since I first tried this restaurant almost 10 years ago (at which point it was already a winning formula), I have seen this restaurant evolve over the years to even greater heights. The menu has expanded to offer more recommended recipes and sides, they allow you to custom order the toppings for your pancake, they continue to offer good discounts such as the Monday Madness (\u00a35 per pancake), the variety of drinks (including fruit beers and milkshakes) are also fantastic and they can now cook gluten-free pancakes! Both the savoury and sweet pancakes are a delight and in good-sized portions, the atmosphere has always been good with cheerful service, homely Dutch decoration and well spaced out tables and ceilings so that it feels humble, open and welcoming. The combination of Belgian fruit beers or silky-smooth milkshakes together with the uniformly large pancakes are perfect for anyone with an appetite and particularly anyone with a sweet tooth.\u00a0P.S. I have also used the Kensington branch which provides the same good all-round quality standards.P.P.S take away is nicely packaged and just as delicious",

They were so bad (thick, flavorless, and dry) that I couldn't eat more than three bites. I only ate the fruit I ordered that was on top of the pancakes. I found it interesting that they didn't ask if anything was wrong with the pancakes after they saw I didn't really touch them, but maybe they don't care that they're making gross pancakes (I actually cannot believe people eat these). My dining partner ordered the non-vegan pancake and, while they didn't think their pancake was as bad as mine, they were underwhelmed by their order too. Can't say I'd recommend this place.",

I felt like a kid in a candy store, we also added a side of scrambled eggs and bacon to make it a complete breakfast. The portion size is insane, this definitely fed both of us and we were glad that we would be walking around the museum to burn off those extra calories. The pancakes were cooked perfectly and sweetened just enough, with the kinder pieces you don't need syrup. There are other options other than the sweet pancakes, they also do savory pancakes as well and when I saw someones order my jaw dropped. I don't think there's a bad thing on this menu, price point it was so affordable. Service was great, the manager came by to check on us a couple of times and our server was really sweet. Definitely stop by My Old Dutch to satiate your sweet tooth!",

    "text": "We had been walking past this place a few times and finally decided i would go in. I love pancakes so i thought i would love this place. However I was bitterly disappointed. We walked and we were given a table straight away. So we were quite please to start with. Then as soon as we sat down, my hands touched the table and I immediately questioned the cleanliness of the place due to the stickiness my fingers were facing. Not even a second later I realised that the whole place stank: a mix of chemical cleaning (i hope) products and sweat. When you go to a pancake place, you do expect smells from the kitchen, not dirty sweat! At that point I was ready to leave but my partner was really starving so we ordered some savoury pancakes. Once they arrived, the disappointment continued; very large plate with a large undercooked pancake with little fillings. I will not go back I'm afraid, it was simply not an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Seriously a fun place, with a really colorful interior and a great soundtrack rocking. On Mondays, many sweet and savory pancake options are close to half price, at \u00a35.65 each! So we ordered two different ones, and they were each the size of a pizza. Huuuuuuge!!We got the My Old Dutch savory, with bacon, chicken, corn, and cheese, as well as the \"Some like it hot\" savory with spicy chilies, hot chicken, and cheese, and they were both great. The hot one was not really hot, but they brought a spicy chili oil that added a little heat. With a side salad and some beers, we had a delicious meal. Too much food! We couldn't do a dessert, but we saw a few that looked amazing. Worth a visit, especially on Mondays!",

    "text": "When you really fancy pancakes, this is your place! I brought my mum here before we went to a West End show. We decided to share a savory pancake and then a sweet one. We went for the 'my old dutch' which is packed with bacon, chicken, ham, peppers and mushrooms. I did enjoy it but thought it was rather overpowered by the cheese, you couldn't really identify the different flavors, just the cheese! Dispute that I did still enjoy the pancake. We then opted for the Nutella pancake and added banana. I enjoyed it, but would have liked the pancake to be slightly thicker and a bit more banana. I would guess there wasn't even a full banana on the pancake, and the Nutella came in a small cup that you must pour on yourself. This could be deemed as a good thing or bad thing, but I just found it hard to evenly distribute the chocolate on the pancake! Service was quick and friendly, I will definitely return and next time I want to try the butterscotch pancakes which are thicker and better for a dessert. They gave me a loyalty card, which just means I will keep going back until I get the free one!",

And we requested for the gluten free option so I can share with my GF husband. It was delicious!The waitress we had initially was a little slow but later we had a switch to a lovely waitress.

    "text": "So when I most recently stayed in London, my mother and I walked by this restaurant twice a day for a week straight: once when we left our hotel to go to the Tube, once when we came back to the hotel. FINALLY, we made sure to walk by in time to actually enjoy a meal here.And oh my sweet goodness, what a meal it was. While the enormous menu offered an incredible variety of pancakes - from the standard kinds to more unique, savory kinds that I doubt you'd find elsewhere (Morracan lamb pancake, anyone?) - my mother and I were both in the mood for a sweet breakfast. And that's exactly what we got. I ended up devouring an entire plate of butterscotch pancakes with fresh, sweet bacon that went PERFECTLY with a side of fried eggs. My mother on the other hand ordered the sweet peach pancake - which was thin but crisp around the edges - and that came with cream which I actually loved on my own pancakes as much as I did on hers.I can say after seeing the size of our meals that this is definitely not the place to go for a small meal; in fact a party of people who came in after us ended up apologizing because they were staring at the enormous food-filled plates that were brought to us. Unfortunately I also remember that the service was not exceptionally quick; in fact my mother and I ended up wondering if the staff totally forgot about us a couple times, as we were seated in a different area of the restaurant than most of its other patrons that day.Overall though we left super satisfied, with full stomachs and very happy sweet-tooths. I would definitely go out of my way to return here for a meal during future treks to London.",

So I finally had the chance to taste these amazing pancakes (it was epic fail the first time as it was pancake day, the queue was a mile long outside and so we had no chance!). Their menu is incredible!!! They have so many options for both sweet and savoury (and in fact pretty impressive starters too). I was very excited to see Bitterballen on the menu as it reminded me of my travels in Europe (if you have never tried them I seriously recommend it - it's mince beef with a creamy sauce/mashed potato filling served with mustard...hmmmm Bitterballen). They also had a cheese version so you veggies out there don't miss out on the good stuff (so considerate) - I can safely say that those sticky, cheese-oozing balls are goooood!! After pondering the menu for quite some time (tough choices with all the options), my friend and I finally decided on our pancakes - Some Like it Hot for me (spicy chicken, chillies, onions and CHEESE) and smoked salmon for my friend (as the name suggests smoked salmon, but with a creamy, rich sauce with mushrooms). We were both delighted with our choices. \u00a0We did well finishing the massive pancake (served on the biggest plate I have ever seen -even bigger than a Romana pizza!) but despite really wanting to try a sweet pancake, there was simply no room. But...that gives us a excuse to go back (like we need one). I'm sure I'll be seeing My Old Dutch very soon...",

It didn't seem quite as extravagant as I had expected but there was a great atmosphere - almost like a US diner style. This together with the great service from the friendly waitresses helped the overall vibe. The menu is very diverse. Lots to choose from its almost too much. I went for the butterscotch pancakes with eggs and bacon. An interesting choice but I was pleased - tasted great :) They also have gluten free pancakes and waffles We also got the peppermint lattes. One of the nicest coffee drinks I remember tasting. Complete with whipped cream on top and not at all too sweet. My friend got the Hawaiian pancake. While my pancakes were the small thick type, hers was the thin long style. I think I prefer that type. It would be helpful if they could state on the menu which type of pancake you'd be getting. Overall I had a great experience and would recommend. Definitely a place you can try out more than once thanks to the huge range of pankakes available.",

The cosy bar area for beers and bitte/kaasboller is gone. The menu is bigger and more kid-friendly (? good or bad depending on your point of view). The fruit beers are still available -phew. The biggest change is in the pancakes. Granted it was Monday and all pancakes are \u00a35, but the food was inedible. The pancake was no longer, thin, silky and crisp at the edges. It was like eating a flat, undercooked Yorkshire pudding. The bacon was fatty, it was drowned in cheese (not even melted) and was a thick bright yellow disc of rubber. The one star is for the peanut milkshake and our poor server who was upbeat and helpful despite everything. RIP My Old Dutch :0(",

Be warned, one pancake is *definitely* enough! I've seen too many people think they want a savoury one, then a sweet one. Guys. You can't handle it. If anything, the pancakes can be a bit too much (the four cheese became a grim marathon), but I appreciate going somewhere in central London and getting two meals for a tenner!On Mondays I don't think you can book but I went with a group of 9 and they got us a table quickly as the downstairs is massive. When it isn't a Monday, prices are reasonable considering the size of the meal (about \u00a37 to \u00a311).The poffertjes are also definitely worth a shout if you aren't battered out!There are a few reasons it doesn't get a higher rating. Firstly, as a cheap eatery, it does feel a little bit rough around the edges (nothing like the beautiful pannekoeken huis I went to when I lived in The Netherlands). Service can be slow and gets things wrong. One time I asked for a pancake without spinach - when it came with the spinach, I sent it back, then when it came back, it was obviously the same pancake with the spinach taken off as the pancake itself had spinach integrated in the batter. I didn't bother returning it a second time but it was frustrating that it was wrong twice.The less said about the toilets, the faster the memories will be exorcised.",

Tasty pancakes of the most huge types delivered to you at the table in the largest plates ever. Always service with a smile when I used to go there in the 80's and 90's and I would want to eat there again, this millennium. Central to Holborn, Tottenham Court Road Stations, a stones throw from The Gt. British Museum and many office and shops, this place is going to be here for a long time. Parking is not available as is the case in most locations in central London but the public service route and journey on foot is very easy to do. There's loads to see along the way.",

Well, in short, they can't, the main reason being that the prices are ridiculous for what you get. It's true, your circle of egg, flour and water stuffed with spinach and identified white cheese will fill you up, but its difficult to countenance paying a tenner for the pleasure. Besides, when I eat pancakes, I like to have a stack of them, plus a massive selection of fillings. If you really must visit My Old Dutch, make sure you do it on a Monday, when all pancakes on the menu are \u00a35.",

What was I supposed to do? Luckily, the menu is extensive but pretty straight forward - you either order savoury or sweet but whatever it is be prepared to see it sitting on a pancake the size of a truck tire! If you go as a couple you can always share! The fruit beers are amazing too and highly recommended as an ideal accompaniment! The interior is bright ,breezy and spacious. The staff are exceptionally friendly and willing to assist you in any manner possible. The food is a delight and served quickly and efficiently. Prices are a little expensive but not by London standards. Be prepared to walk out a few pounds heavier! Don't wait for Shrove Tuesday (Pancake Day!). You'll be back! Enjoy!",

The maitre d' was very helpful and quick to seat us downstairs. Our friendly waitress was at the table with our menus as soon as we were seated. We decided to go for a starter of fried cheese balls and a duck and greek pancake to share between three of us as a main course. The cheese balls came speedily to the table and were absolutely delicious! I can't fault them one bit. The main course of pancakes (of course) was beautiful too, especially the Greek. The halloumi cheese was delicious, and I when I asked for no olives, I got no olives.. fantastic! The only strange moment was with dessert. We had the Nutella pancake, which again was beautifully made. We asked for a scoop of ice cream with the pancake, and rather than a generic Vanilla ice-cream scoop, for some reason we had strawberry.. which was lovely for my partner and mother, but I myself am not a fan of strawberry ice cream. Apart from that, absolutely DELICIOUS! I'm looking forward to going back on a Monday to indulge in the \u00a35 Monday deal.",

I had never been to London before and had been seriously thinking about visiting for YEARS. Finally, I was sick of wishing and hoping, and decided that I would just go gosh darn it! So, with very little plans in terms of sightseeing, I just went to various neighborhoods armed with my well stocked Google Maps (full of delightful restaurants - food was the one thing I made time to plan) and perambulated about. As I was trying to orient myself in the area, I saw that My Old Dutch was nearby on GMaps, so I thought \"heck! I am not leaving here without stuffing my face with sweet pancake-y goodness\" and boy am I so glad I did! I ordered a sweet pancake, really a crepe - though sweeter and chewier, with powdered sugar and nutella. OMG, this thing was enormous and oh so good! I was really planning on having just a few bites as it really wasn't that long since I had had lunch, but I almost finished off the plate! It was sweet and chewy, good enough to eat alone but nutella just kicked the flavors into overdrive! Little piggy that I was, I knew I couldn't leave without finally trying poffertjes, tiny pancakes renowned throughout the Netherlands. I got mine to go and it's a shame I didn't snap a pic. They were thick and chewy, almost like little cupcakes, and filled with little morsels of chocolate. Absolute heaven. Next time, I'll have to make it to Amsterdam so I can do some comparison tasting, but My Old Dutch is definitely Good Eats.",

We were lucky enough to be seated immediately. My friend and I shared a duck and a berry. We had some issues with drinks (our waitress didn't seem to know what she was doing at all), and the food came later than we would've liked, but considering how busy the place was, the service was acceptable. The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. The pancakes were crepes, not actual pancakes, and unlike Pancake Bakery, the dishes consisted of way more crepe than filling. They looked big, but we finished them really quickly. The duck pancake was good, but there were only two or three small pieces of duck in it -- it just tasted like a hoisin sauce-flavoured crepe with a mushroom here and there. The berry pancake was kind of a let down. The berries were unbearably sour, even when mixed with a huge spoonful of ice cream. I'll definitely come back on another Monday to try more savoury flavours (the chicken curry and the chili con carne both sound really good) but I'll make sure to lower my expectations before I go.",

A relaxed holiday feeling as everything is at a unrushed, unhurried pace and there is a air of novelty and sense of almost being transported back in time to a very special place in Holland. The Food The Menu is fun and helps customers easily chose from sweet or savory pancakes to delight and tantalize the test buds. The Savory, Lamb Stew, Chicken Curry and The Make Ya Own. The savory pancakes are a little more like pizza with so many toppings to chose from and all are pleasing to the eye as well as the pallet. The most popular dish on the list is The Amsterdamer. Soft yellow pancake that just melt in the moth oozing with gorges juicy apple slices and thick slices of Dutch beacon all c coved in a sticky, gooey real maple syrup making this a cross between breakfast and desert and so large on arrival its pleasing to the eye and satisfying to each tasty morsel in each mouthful and very hard even when full to leave any on the plate. At around \u00a37.00 - \u00a311.00 each pancake its worth making a meal out of it, filling and wholesome, this is real food as well a good fast food as it takes less than 15 minuets to be served and less then 10 to fill you boots.",

I was expecting a pancake but it essentially was a crepe with sundried tomatoes, cheese and olives-all yummy just the same. Next time I plan to eat sweet.",

Friendly and polite staff. Pancake was served up quickly and I have to say I had a mint chocolate milkshake and it was the best iv ever had. I didnt think it was over priced for what we had. I managed to eat my main meal though my friend couldnt due to the sheer size and quantity of filling of his pancake. couldnt manage a starter or pudding!!!! Definantly recommend eating here if youv never experienced it. My friend has now recommended it to all his friends and collegues.",
