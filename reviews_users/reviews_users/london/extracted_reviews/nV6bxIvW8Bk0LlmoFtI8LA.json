    "text": "Lovely simple middle eastern food with great clean flavours and unpretentious prices, and very decent service.Came here for a Saturday lunch. Will be back to try more things!I tried a few dishes: haloumi cheese, tabouleh, the 3-skewer meal, moussaka (which was an aubergine salad - not what I thought this was).Everything was very very good. The cheese was delicious, great texture, and a nice browning on it. Tabouleh wasn't too acidic and had a nice balance of all the ingredients. The aubergine salad was delicious. \u00a0The 3-skewers of meats were very flavourful and provided a good \"protein\" component to the entire experience.All the dishes came with a good set of toppings and herbs, making the entire experience full of delicious flavours. I strongly recommend our order for anyone wanting to share a lunch!Take note of the 3 pound cover charge per person. However you get a big bowl of vegetables, olives, and some onion/garlic dip, and bread - before you even order.Pinot Grigio was good side order for a drink.We got a fruit plate at the end, not sure if that's standard - lovely cubes of pineapple and strawberries, very fresh and nice.Service: was excellent. Potentially exhibiting some personal bias to our table :-) We'll be back!",

Nevertheless, still come here for the food. Stand out dishes for me were the moussaka and the grilled lamb baked in yoghurt. Prices were around \u00a315 each, which left us happy and full. Only let down was poor service.",

    "text": "After reading the positive reviews on a few sites, we decided to try a late lunch at Fairuz. \u00a0After about 2 hours, I had a very bad case of food poisoning, including vomiting and diarrhoea (sorry to be graphic, but I thought it would be best to share). \u00a0We thought maybe it wasn't the food, but then about an hour later, my lunch guest had the same food poisoning. \u00a0This was the only meal we ate together that day, so it had to be the restaurant.That night after the vomiting subsided, I called the restaurant to speak with the manager. \u00a0I spoke to a manager, who seemed to be trying to convince me that it could not be the restaurant's fault. \u00a0He said things like \"We do not have refrigerators, and we make everything fresh, so it can't be us.\" \u00a0After a too many minutes of this, I asked to speak to his manager. \u00a0He said that the main manager was not there, and he took down my phone number, and promised the main manager would call me back. \u00a0Of course the call never came.I have called back multiple times, and when explaining the situation, am met with curt answers and no return calls from the elusive main manager.In addition to all of this, when you go to this restaurant, they bring you a basket of whole vegetables, such as carrots, a head of lettuce and a cucumber, without prompting, and then charge you for it. \u00a0This basket of vegetables is a ridiculous method to milk more money from the customers without them knowing.I was completely dissatisfied with this restaurant, and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

I liked everything single thing they put in front of us and we hardly left any scraps behind which can't be a bad thing. Also had a pretty good bottle of Lebanese wine for \u00a315. All in all, I thought it was a good meal.The service was good too - we didn't book a table but they still seated us right away despite being pretty full. And plus a crowded restaurant is never a bad sign.I would definitely go back just not everyday as it's a little expensive for everyday fair.",

The food was not bad, but it certainly wasn't delicous. The houmous was average (I've had better from the super market) and the mains (shish kebabs) were just ok. I've had much better middle eastern food for much cheaper prices from various outlets across London. The service is ok and the restaurant is quite nice, although a little cramped. Don't bother with this place. There are lots of better place to dine around Marleybone High Street and if you are looking for Lebanese food or some nice grilled meat then make a short journey somewhere else.",

I still remember the charming section of Marylebone it was located in, right off the heavily trafficked High Street and full of other small ethnic dining spots like a Moroccan tea house, little boutiques and a wonderful travel bookstore. It was the perfect environ for such a restaurant. It's unassuming and simply decorated, with warm wood walls and tables and a smattering of cultural artifacts. Now, I wont lie. I remember the setting and the company but the whole experience is a general haze. I was there four years ago. Four long, torturous years removed from the most perfect of cities. I just want a first to review in the city I love and a nostalgic excuse to remember a fabulous year in my life. Don't get me wrong, I'm not just making this all up as I go along. I may not remember how much the mezze plate we all shared was, but the food was good. It was flavorful, the service for a group of nearly twenty was attentive and the upstairs private dining area was spacious enough to be comfortable. I remember bits and pieces, I'm just more concerned with the selfish ones.",

It's an intimate restaurant with friendly and attentive service. Of course we over ordered... but that's the way of things. Highlights included the aged cheese in olive oil, the kibbe, and these little lamb pies wrapped in philo dough (drool). The wine was decent but the selection is very limited, with the primary emphasis on the Ksara winery in the Bekaa valley. Next time I'll opt for Arak like to Lebanese couple sitting next to us.",

The food is fantastic. When you sit down they serve olives, salad vegetables for you to cut up youself, and a great dish of what I think is onions, peppers and tomato finely chopped. Everything I've eaten there has been great, from the hot and cold meze (falafel, borek, fattoush, a great aubergine, garlic and yogurt dip that I can never remember the name of) to the grilled meats. If you order the mixed meze the food just keeps coming, ending with a big platter of grilled lamb, chicken and kofta on flat break with onions, parsely and lemon. Fresh fruit platters are really nice to finish and the only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because the seats are really uncomfortable which is a shame.",

They also have a good selection of vegetables-based meal such as falafel, musakaa and grilles aubergine salad. They all taste delicious and melt into your mouth. Hummus, yoghurt dip and bread are must order and it all work perfectly with the grill and vegetable dishes. I would also recommend borak which is a fried pastry with halloumi cheese and parsley filling. It is like a Lebanese dumpling and tastes so good!I had mango juice which was also very nice and I love the people and atmosphere at this place.

What I like about this place is the fact that it's not as glossy and pretentious as your typical Marylebonian restaurant. The interior is very warm and welcoming and it invites you to linger and engage in a wonderful conversation. \u00a0The other day I went to Fairuz with 10 colleagues of mine. What was really nice was that they were able to accommodate a large group like this at relatively last-minute. Plus, they sat us at one big table upstairs and we pretty much could be as vocal as we wanted. The staff was super friendly and they were fast and efficient. Being a large group, we opted for the standard menu at \u00a325 per person. This gives you the typical hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, falafel and plenty of meat. In my opinion, this place offers a good introduction to Lebanese cuisine. In fact, when I came here for the first time many years ago, I was pretty much a virgin when it came to Lebanese cuisine and so I was excited about it. Having been to many different Lebanese restaurants in London since, I find that this place actually only offers the standard fair; at good value for money though - considering that this is Marylebone.",

The Borek - filo pasty stuffed with haloumi and feta - was quite oily and the pastry was too thick and heavy. My sister had an eggplant dish with rice and it said it was meant to come with haloumi, but it didn't... Our food also took a long time to get to us and we were there well after lunch and well before dinner!!! Other patrons got served before we did even though we arrived before them..

So very wrong.The food here is delicious. The sambousek (called Borak on their menu) was cheesy enough. The kebbe was amazing. The shankleesh was great. The arayis were so good we ordered more. For mains, we had Kharouf mahshi. The rice was so amazing, as was the meat.This restaurant is so good, I might just go to London every time I have a case of the home sickness. I really can't stress enough how much I loved this meal.The staff were so friendly, they gave us baklawa on the house.So recommended. Do it.",

I got hummus and falafel as starters and the baked aubergine as my main. It was all pretty good. I've definitely had way better falafel, it was quite hard and seemed a bit old but the flavors were adequate. The hummus was very yum and my baked aubergine was delicious. I do wish it was more aubergine and less curry/chickpeas, but with the light and fluffy rice, I was satisfied!",

The staff are super friendly and welcoming. \u00a0I definetely recommend this place to all my friends who come to London. 5/5 for sure.",

We had the hummus to keep us going which was great plus a beer and a couple of the meat dishes. It was all delicious and I can't fault it really apart from to say it came out to over \u00a320 each for lunch for hummus and a main. Felt it was a little steep but good quality food.",

The starters, home made sausages in a devine lemon olive oil sauce, were utterly delicious. My boned baby chicken was char grilled to perfection and my wife's lamb was melt in the mouth. The quality of the food was enhanced by the antics of our delightful waiter. A continuous flow of small moments that kept up amused. Customers were told it was full despite being anything but. I raised my eyebrows to our waiter in sympathy when he was dealing with a couple of tricky customers. With that he produced extra side dishes for us and we were furnished with pudding for free. The whole thing was a delight of great food and quirky behaviour. We loved it.Diamond in the rough? Well the food surpassed the tatty interior design skill by miles. Kerb appeal is pretty low. Trust the food reviews.",

The food was served promptly after ordering and was exceptional. It was just a shame that when it cam to getting the bill \u00a0a waiter was hard to find. P.S the lamb sausages starter is rocking and a must have.",

You know you're becoming and expert when you pay attention to every little detail - from the swiftness of the service and quality of food to the tidiness of the restrooms. Rest assured that everything from my list was kept and it was a magical night with lots of wine and lamb on the table. I had the stuffed with rice and herbs lamb which was out of this world amazing. At some point the conversation somehow dialed down and when I looked around, everyone were focused on their food and smiling, happy as clams.",

    "text": "So just to set the situation here... I love lebanese food, so that makes me both subjective and objective in my opinion with regard to Fairuz.So for the objective part: their food is great. Like in every Lebanese restaurant, a huge choice of mezze to start with and then a few dishes like grilles meat. All of very good quality, fairly priced for London, and with good service. No real favourite, but I must say that the mezze are really good, like the fattoush, the hummus with lamb, etc... Portions are good, so you won't be starving, on the contrary. I'd just like a bit more garlic with the grilled chicken, but I guess maybe better not bring too much standard to avoid problems with most peopleService is also efficient (the only mezze that always takes long is the grilled halloumi, no clue why, but the rest is quick) and very friendly. And when you're about to finish your meal, they always bring fruits and/or small lebanese pastries.For the subjective part, as I said service is friendly, and you get a warm welcome, and this place makes you feel good while outside it's drizzly and grey ;-)",
