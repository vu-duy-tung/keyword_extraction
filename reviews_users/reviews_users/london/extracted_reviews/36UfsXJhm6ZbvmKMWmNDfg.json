Well for a start we didnt manage to get there for the table of 13 we booked on the 26/03/11...yes thats right, the night of the bad riots going on in London right by the Planet Hollywood. When we phoned them up 40 mins before our due arrival to explain that NO TAXI would take us and our 5 YOUNG CHILDREN down that way due to the riots, we were treated as if we were being silly and asked if we could walk there instead... YES,WITH OUR CHILDREN, we told them we were not putting our children's lives at risk and could we have a refund for the deposit of \u00a3130 or a credit note lasting about 18months as we are from Wales and only go up to London once a year....We were told that they do not give refunds and that the credit note will only last 3 months. We were also told that we were the only people who didnt turn up and our table of 13 was there empty...if it was that busy, why was the table empty all night isn't it? The riots were still going on into Sunday morning so somehow I dont think we were the only family that couldn't get there. Terrible service and we are not likely to let this matter go I can assure you!!!! I would be interested to know if anyone else has had the same problem due to the riots",

There's tv screens and props all around which makes it feel more exclusive than an ordinary restaurant. Service was good. However, when we arrived we did have to sit and wait at the bar for quite a while despite having booked a table. The food was quite nice. However, I'm a vegetarian and there was very limited choice for me. Everyone did enjoy their meal but I'm not sure if it's worth the price! Think you do pay for the novelty value a bit though! Had a lovely cocktail though which was pretty impressive (though still pricey!). Overall, I'd say it's a fun place for a kid's birthday but do bear in mind that you are paying extra for the novelty value of the place. Wouldn't particularly recommend it for a group of adults - there are much better places to eat in London.",

But unfortunately its not all good, as the service here has been terrible every time Ive visited. The first time I was told we would have to wait to be seated, which was fine, except 20 minutes later we were still stood there with no explanation as to why we had to wait so long. In the end we left. Hoping it was just a bad day, I returned with my partner a few weeks later. We were seated quickly this time, our drinks order taken and we were given menus. However it then took 20 minutes for our drinks order to arrive, with not a single server walking past us. We complained about this, and were told we'd been sat in an awkward to see place. We ordered food and it took almost an hour to arrive. Despite a complaint, nothing was done about this and we werent offered any compensation for the slow service, being told we can only serve as fast as the food is cooked - fair enough if only we had been informed of this at some point during our wait! Maybe Ive gone twice at bad times, who knows? But what I do know is I wont be going back.",

We assumed that because it was a week day, not a school holiday and not a prime time of day, that we'd have no problem getting a seat - how wrong we were! I can understand that it's a well known restaurant in the countries capital, but we waited at least 25 minutes just to be seated. We shrugged this off and looked forward to our meal - only to wait another 20 minutes before our drinks order was even taken! Service staff kept passing us by, completely oblivious that we hadn't even had our order taken. By the end of the meal we were served by about five different people! I've given this place two stars because the food, although quite expensive, was delicious! The sizzling fajita's were something special! On the whole the restaurant is quite interesting to look at, with all the memorabilia, but the cheesy school-disco dj ruined the whole dining experience! Next time I want to eat at a theme restaurant - I'm going to the Hard Rock cafe!",

Located right in the heart of Piccadilly Circus it does tend to get busy with the tourists, so you would be advised to book in advance. When we first went in, we spent most of the time just looking around to see what was there and from which films. The menu is also a gastronomic delight with very large portions in typical American dining style. I recommend their Surf and Turf speciality if you want to treat yourself. Prices are reasonable for London in this tourist area.",

I had prebooked a table online and requested if possible one in the James Bond area as we all like Bond, James Bond. We arrived intime for our reservation and were shown to our table which was indeed in the James Bond room, fab, the tabel also had balloons in place for my daughter which was lovely considering i hadnt asked for anything special apart from the location. The waiter was great, really friendly, service was good and the food we had was infact really nice, my husband and i had steaks and our daughter their unusal lasagne that comes in stood up rolls that look like wraps, she said it was delicious! The food is probably overpriced for that kind of restaurant but we used some Tesco vouchers so only paid for drinks really which was ok, the smoothies are lovely too My husband and i didnt have a desert but our daughter had a sundae and they brought that all decorated with sparklers and played and sang happy birthday to her which was nice. The screens were fun as they had a rolling message display and we had a birthday message put up for our daughter which delighter her. This is a great fun place if you have kids or big kids but its not to be taken as a serious eating place.",

    "text": "Planet Hollywood in Leicester Square initially seemed like a great place to go for a spot of dinner on my friends 21stbut at the end of the night i realised it was just bog standard food you'd be able to get at your local harvester, that is EXTREMELY overpriced. Between the 3 of us, 1 shared starters, 3 main courses, 3 drinks (non alcoholic) and 3 desserts cost \u00a3100 The portions are huge, but the generally taste of the food is nothing to get excited about, i'd prefer quality over quantity anyday. The Menu seemed quite limited in choice, and there is hardly anything to eat for vegetarians. The dessert Menu is also extremely limited. They do offer typical american diner 'junk food' (fries, chips, burgers , ribs, steaks etc) and some pasta dishes, salads, and quite a range of appetisers. The taste is pleasant, but honestly a burger at harvester or KFC would have given me the same satisifaction. If your trying to avoid oily, greasy food definately keep away from it. Its pretty bland stuff but they do serve all their dishes with a range of sauces/dips. The service is extremely friendly, but beware there is a compulsory service charge of 12.5% of the total bill, so we had to tip the waitress a total of \u00a311.00!! :| Not friendly on a student budget.. The surrounds are definately lovely, with a huge TV screen in the front of the restaurant playing some music, and exotic palm trees covered in lights surrounding our tables. The decor had a funky vibe, and the colours are bright, exciting and attractive. There are 2 eating area's and a regular bar area. Despite it being called planet hollywood, there really didnt seem to be that many props from film sets, i dont recall being WOWed at all by anything. They have a few things sparsely scattered around the walls of the buildings, in dimly lit area's and suspended in dirty/worn out looking class cabinets. John travolta's jacket from grease and the terminator outfit was there. I cant even remember what else they had, they do have a few celebrity hand prints, such as will smith, but honestly i didnt find this exciting at all. I just thought they would have had more, perhaps a red carpet, and more glamour. It just seemed a bit tacky and touristy/overpriced.",

I called in on Sunday evening after seeing a huge sign outside advertising 2 courses and a galss of wine for \u00a310 which sounded too good to be true. It was. We sat down and, luckily, asked about the offer before ordering drinks, upon which the waiter explained that the offer was only valid on monday to friday lunchtimes. Upon seeing the regualar prices, we discreetly made our exit. When we got right up close to the sign, these terms and conditions were displayed, but in tiny writing which was invisible in the dark. I do not think they should display this sign at times (and especially on days) when the offer is not valid. This is very misleading.",

The great Mr Schwarzenegger has been in the news a lot recently for his little (maybe not so little) jab below the belt - and I couldn't help but reminisce about the many times I have visited a Planet Hollywood - and...somewhat regretted it afterwards - possibly even like the fling that Arnie had 10 years ago. But, he may not have been in a 'Termination' mood back then, in retrospect, all things considered.Like all 'Theme' styled eateries, where you are taken back to another time, and yet another place - with the staff all hoping (rather, praying) you are so engrossed in the kitsch memorabilia hanging from the walls, you forget the time it takes them to refill your glass or even deliver you your meal. Again, Arnie could have frolicked 'Around the World in 80 Days' by the time it took to deliver the grub.Really, are we seriously talking about - absolutely have to have it 'Die Hard' cuisine' here? Alright, OK. I AM being a tad harsh. What were we actually expecting. Lunch at the Savoy? We can, of course, now recite the menu backwards 'cause it reads like most 'American styled glitzy bandwagon - lost all imagination restaurants' which have been cloned out there to the point of screaming annoyance - and, they are still trying to resuscitate the action and keep the theme going like they have done at 'The Aladdin Casino' Las Vegas - ever since Moses lost GPS contact in the Nevada Bull-rushes. But still, if you want longevity, then Planet Hollywood in Vegas is certainly the place, just ask The King of Las Vegas himself, Mr. Wayne Newton. He could very easily pass for one of Planet Hollywood's re-fried shrimps.I guess for nostalgia reasons (we've all got a soft side) we give them a bit of slack - in this case, two marvellous stars in fact. But, once the 'Collateral Damage' hits the table, you realise it just wasn't worth it and then you finally send in 'The Expendables!'",

The place is not too expensive, at least by the standards of the location. But it's quite glitzy. The bar area has a number of television sets which continuously show some sports or musical programmes or wish customers, not all of them kids, on their birthdays. They have quite a good and extensive cocktail menu. They make a really good \"Long Island Iced Tea\". They serve the drink after mixing the Coke well with the alcohol, just the way I like it. I haven't eaten at Planet Hollywood very often, but there is one dish there that I love. It's their world famous chicken crunch. The four pieces of fried chicken breast are served with a fantastic creole mustard sauce and carrots. The coating of the chicken is slightly sweet, which goes very well with the mustard. I order this quite frequently with my drink. The bartenders here, unlike most in London, do like to talk and they also enjoy their conversations with customers, at least with the interesting ones like me ;) I have many reasons to keep returning.",

But after a late night visit here, I couldn't help but find myself won over by its charms.Let's get straight to the positives. Unlike virtually all the other restaurants in the area, it's open late, closing at midnight. This makes it a perfect, not to mention highly appropriate place to grab some late munchies after the last showing at the Cineworld cinema next door. The service is friendly and prompt - my friend and I couldn't really have asked for much more on this front.The range of drinks is relatively limited but serviceable: Sol, San Miguel, Amstel, 1664 etc.. My friend and I went for Amstels so can't comment on the milkshakes.Then there's the food. Slightly pricey maybe, but not that extortionate for some of the more common foods such as hamburgers. Plus, in true US style, the servings are very generous: the chicken fajitas I had were very filling and tasty enough. Sure, I wouldn't call it haute cusine, but it's good enough and probably better than you might expect.The negatives? The music is pretty loud, and if you (like me) don't like irritating pop/r'n'b wannabes, can be pretty annoying. The prices are also slightly higher than one might expect, but again, not ridiculously so.Overall: quite a bit better than I expected. I'd definitely consider returning here post-Cineworld for the convenience offered, decent enough food and good service.",

    "text": "We had planned a great night out for our work team to celebrate and thought Planet Hollywood would be a great place to go because the food and cocktails both looked great. This is probably where the good stuff ended as the moment we arrived we were treated like we were worthless. We had been given gift vouchers to use as a reward \u00a0however to the staff this meant we weren't worthy of be treated respectfully as a guest or as a person. When checking in the waitress pointed on a list to another colleague that we were using vouchers at which they rolled their eyes at ach other,.My boss was going to pay separately so she could use a 20%coupon and were told that she would have to sit at a completely different table to use because someone using a discount voucher cannot sit at the same table as someone \u00a0using a gift voucher even though these would be on separate bills. I cannot think of anything more ludicrous than this!!Even after speaking to the manager who to be honest didn't look like he could give two hoots we decide to go to Hard Rock Cafe instead. The moment we arrived at Hard Rock Cafe we were greeted in a friendly manner and treated with respect. We had an amazing meal and amazing service- We were able to use our vouchers no problem and then we even left a generous tip (in cash) because we have such a great experience.The fact that Planet Hollywood would rather have customers walk out with an awful experience than make a quite reasonable allowance is beyond me. I have worked \u00a0in the service industry for the last 15 years and this would rate up there as one of the worst experiences I have had. It is very disappointing for such a big company to have such a weak store letting down their whole reputation. I will be making sure that noone I know visits the London Restaurant again. Hard Rock is only a few steps away but is beyond miles better in all aspects. There is a reason why Hard Rock have lines out the door every night yet you can walk straight into Planet Hollywood. Don't waste your time! or your money!",

The food was of a high standard as were the staff but the actual place has let its standards slip I felt. Once upon a time you could choose a room to sit in as long as they weren't booked for parties, but now, even if you book beforehand, you will end up in the main restaurant room, and you can't even look in the other rooms if you ask! Overall, a good standard of food with nice staff, but needs to open the restaurant up more to please paying customers, after all - we pay to see the 'hollywood' props too!",

Planet Hollywood makes the Hard Rock cafe seem like fine dining with it's dreadful offerings that might be fine for a one off at a cool 9 year old girl's birthday party with her troop of budettes, but not for much more. They managed to serve up the worst \u00a35 shake I have ever had in my life. I will try to remember that when I balk at paying \u00a34.50 for a malt or a shake at the Good Life Diner. And just when I thought the Rivington was serving up the most expensive burger in town with their \"Luxury\" burger of ground Aberdeen Angus Steak, along comes the \"Expendables\" burger which was nothing more than the cheese burger with a \u00a32 surcharge for the name. In fact the actual cheese burger looked a whole lot better with bacon on it to boot! The old Planet Hollywood up the road might have been cool, but this new place looks like it's a cinema lobby with a few bits of Hollywood memorabilia, from a T-Birds leather jacket to Ursula Andres' underwear, scattered across the walls in no apparent organised fashion, and by no means oozes the same kind of \"rock star\" status that the hard rock does, or sticky fingers for that matter. Planet Hollywood scores a BIG FAT ZERO in my book and I would never ever recommend it to anyone, unless of course I want to send them to hell.",

The service was very friendly (maybe a bit too much), expect to be asked your life story while deciding which burger to have. I had the surf and turf with a jacket potato. It was all well cooked and better than I thought it would be. There's just something a bit stale about this place, and it didn't surprise me that it wasn't packed out on a Friday night. Why was I there? Well that's another story!",

It's a bit of a tourist trap (the gaggle of student tourists outside when we arrived proved this). BUT, there are some things that make it worthwhile. Ish. There's a lot of memorabilia around the place. And that's cool. Ever wondered where the bikini Ursela Andres wears in the Bond film is (the Spy Who Loved Me?) well it's here. In their private room. With a James Bond Tux. See? That's kinda exciting. And they do a good mimosa too. So extra points for that. Nice enough nibbles, friendly staff, interesting stuff to look at. I wouldn't make a point of coming here again (anywhere on Haymarket actually), but if I did end up here, it wouldn't be the end of the world.",

    "text": "I wanted to like it, really I did. The newly moved Planet Hollywood - it's taken over the Quod site on Haymarket - was going to have less focus on the memorabilia and more emphasis on the food. It's a formula that's worked in other places: the Vegas one is now a well-respected steakhouse for example. Would that work in London? Maybe we'll know one day but for now it's business as usual. And that's not necessarily a good thing. I've got very fond memories of PH from the early days so it was sad to watch standards decline in later years. The food used to be pretty good. No, really, it did. The blackened shrimp in particualr was an excellent dish. That's still on the menu but it's a shadow of its former self. The wings are still first rate - perfect spicing, moist meat, deeply suckable sauce - and I suspect other dishes will pass muster. But the burger has been surpassed by many other places and seriously why offer the chance to have it cooked how I like if it's still going to come well done? Portions are vast, the huge groups of noisy 15 year olds seemed to love it, and the cocktails will certainly keep you buzzing, even if they're a little slow to reach you. A couple though shouldn't have seen the light of day at all. Bleurgh. Still, could all be teething problems - they're sort of soft launching at the mo - and there is still some enjoyment to be had wolfing comfort food next to Indiana Jones' whip. I'm not writing it off just yet.",

A good choice on the menu for both children and adults, fairly expensive but as it was for a special summer holiday treat it was OK. I was expecting burgers and chips to be the only food on the menu, so was pleasantly surprised when I managed to order chicken sizzling fajitas! The portion size was uber large but again as it was a treat and not something we do every month it was enjoyable. It came to about \u00a380 for 2 adults and 2 children with meals and drinks (and the 12.5% tip!) The venue was great with film props all around the restaurant including the Hoff's Baywatch shorts, loads of Bond goodies, the Terminator clothes things from Indiana Jones. pretty much loads of film props! They also had a large flat screen where the DJ would zoom around the room and zoom in on people who had mentioned it was their birthday or other special occasions. All in all, a great place to have a lovely, but large meal but it is fairly expensive and busy.",

    "text": "The three \"R's\" ... Rude, Rancid, Rubbish\" Soul destroying place with indifferent staff. To be fair the Nacho sharing platter arrived promptly and had been lovingly microwaved to within an inch of its life. The waiting staff had all been expertly trained in not making eye contact or acknowledge diners. This was quite a feat as we were sat next to a serving station where staff congregated. The mains arrived. 3 burger luke warm. 1 portion of chips \u00a0between the three of us when we ordered one each and a cheese and tomato pizza tasting of cleaning fluid. Pizza sent back only to be told \"we've tasted it in the kitchen. It tastes fine to us\". No apology was given. This put a bit of a damper on the day. Would not recommend, go to McDonalds.",

We were told, three times, that we would be catered for, and would be given starters instead of deserts.Upon arriving, we were quickly shown to a table, small mercies, but when explaining we're vegan were told there was nothing available, and that we were only allowed deserts as part of the deal, not starters. Embarassed and trying to appease the slightly annoyed waiter, we opted for the veggie burger, containing both milk and egg, and when trying to explain why we weren't particularly impressed were greeted with 'Well it's not like you're allergic or anything is it? It'll be fine'. Needless to say, we ate the chips, nibbled at the burger, and left, without even attempting desert.",

    "text": "When I was a kid, coming to Planet Hollywood was a rare treat. Now as a grown-up, I'm a little savvier as to how these big-name places operate and know the food rarely rises above average. \u00a0So tbh, when my brother suggested coming here, I wanted to scoff, but since it was his treat, I acted all mature-like and demurred. I'm glad I did as I think it was ok after all. The staff were really friendly, the food came fast and portions were generous. And there's so much random stuff to check out - Bruce Willis's outfit from Die Hard, Halle Berry's famous orange bikini etc. It's fun to wander around, even if just once! There's a lot of variety on the menu, in an 'international' style - noodles, burger, pizza, tex-mex. So I thought I'd opt safe with cheesy garlic bread - and interesting with the spinach artichoke dip (which you still don't see much of in the UK). The results were actually converse to what was expected - the bread was dry and chewy, but the dip was spectacular. I know that a lot of food comes frozen here but I'd guess that this dip was fresh made, the spinach was properly green and had a little bite to it, and it wasn't all pulverised as I've seen other dips. I'd actually come back, just to order this starter again :)",
