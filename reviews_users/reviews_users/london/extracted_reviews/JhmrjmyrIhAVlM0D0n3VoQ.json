The view is AMAZING and the decor as well. I had read a few bad reviews for the service but when I was there even though it was a busy night service was great. We asked to change tables and at the moment they had a reservation on that table but as soon that they realized the table was not showing up anymore they moved us. The food is still a little less good that in the Vegas but almost perfect. Great place for a date!",

    "text": "Great views, poor food. Drenched in sauce most of the time for no reason. Delicate food like the foie gras and salmon was unnecessarily soaked in the topping, making it hard to taste either the salmon or the foie gras. Same issue with the shrimp tempura. The wagyu beef gyoza have a poor filling-dough ratio. Thumbs up for the green bean tempura and the great aioli on the side. Tip: get a table by the window but in that case, bring a long-sleeve top because you may end up right under the very powerful aircon.",

The staff were welcoming and we never once felt out of place for wearing jeans or wandering around to take in the view. We didn't feel quite brave enough to sit on the outside 'mezzanine', but we did manage to bag the best seat in the place \u00a0a quiet table for two looking out east/north-east/west, which gave us amazing views of the Olympic Park, and our home icon of Alexandra Palace.Although the fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian sounds like a strange marriage, the food is exquisite. That obviously comes at a price, but then you are paying for the view as well as the food. Our pick of the dishes would have to include the pork belly wraps and the showy but fantastic Yuzu Meringue 'Tart', which was worth the wait to get it to our table.",

It goes so fast and you get to see the whole view of the City. It gives you a great buzz and gave me great excitement to see the bar.However, I have to say I was disappointed. Poor interior, poor service, painful prices.I didn't try the sushi unfortunately, only a glass of Ros\u00e9. The terrace however, was very cute. It had a completely different atmosphere and the thought that you're standing outside on a very high building is a great feeling.I'm sure if I tried the cocktails or the food, I'd have a more positive opinion but I have no plans of returning.From the whole SushiSamba experience which my friends always raved about, I have to say the lift up to the bar was the only exciting part. And the lift down.",

We ordered miso soup as an appetizer and received the soups 10 minutes after our main course (cut rolls) had arrived. Isn't miso soup pretty easy to make? We ordered green tea and received matcha (nothing special), but we're very surprised to see the charge for green tea was nine pounds! I've been to the SS in New York, and I have to say, my experience was 100x better there.",

The menu is large enough to cater to everybody's tastes, and the waiting staff are extremely helpful and knowledgable about the menu. One of the major attractions of sushisamba is the view from the restaurant. The views over London are spectacular - if you can get a window seat, it will transform a wonderful meal to an experience you will never forget. The bar outside is a great place to grab a drink after your meal and the views are just spectacular. If you like sushi, or are trying it for the first time, this place is a must!",

Pretty impressive.The service was also quite prompt and helpful.The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars from me was that food was very good, but perhaps just shy of top notch. Admittedly, the primary fare that SS has is not necessarily my favorite, so perhaps I'm not a good judge. That being said, the yellowtail taquitos, black cod, and plaintain chips were all very good. I did think the \"With Love From Rio\" dessert was outstanding.",

    "text": "I want to rate this place higher, and higher, and higher, and higher, but the views from the 38th floor of the Heron tower are just not enough to save this restaurant as an absolute top sushi joint for me. I much prefer the \"small things come in big packages\" approach (meaning, find a neighbourhood sushi joint that will knock your trowsers off).The outside bar is way cool - with a huge orange steel tree in the centre. Plan ahead or you'll never get a seat. Of the few cocktails on the menu, one of them is a mojito - so they lose points for creativity in my opinion. For a fusion restaurant combining two of the world most eclectic cuisines (Japanese and South American) I would have expected more creative margaritas, caipirinhas, sake-based cocktails, etc. \u00a0If you do go, try the \"shiso-fine\". Best cocktail on the list.Once inside, the food is inconsistently decent. Round One: The Yellowtail Taquitos and the Rock Shrimp Tempura are amazing!Round Two: The Pork Belly wraps are good as well but they are gone before you realise what you have on your plate. Be careful to ask about portion sizes. Many items only come with x2 or x4 per plate so if your a group of three(3), which we were, the servers don't exactly go out of their way to inform you. Round Three: The sushi rolls. They are decent - but don't expect bang-up-amazing-melt-in-your-mouth cuts of fish. Stay clear of the El Topo roll, unless your going to eat it up quickly. Once the mozzarella sits for two long it becomes more like dried-up toothpaste. Not cool.I have to say that the sushi/sashimi was pretty good.Would I go again? Yes, but at about 60.00-80.00 per person it's not really worth it for dinner. The views are stunning but you can get better consistent quality sushi elsewhere. If you want to impress someone, or plan a daytime date, pick a clear day and do lunch. You might catch me there.",

Perhaps it was end of service, perhaps it was because we went a few weeks after it had opened, but paying ~\u00a330 for 9 pieces of sashimi, I would have thought that it would have tasted a better than what I thought was a bit cardboardy which was pretty disappointing to say the least.I would go back there for a Client/work event and gladly try the food again, or to take my better half for a panoramic cocktail, but aside from that, I probably wouldnt.",

It wasn't busy but the bartender next to us chatted for 30 minutes before turning to us to day 'your better off going inside for a drink - it'll be quicker' I was literally shocked to silence.

They suggested we try the middle floor, who apparently had space, but sent us to the first floor as both floor restaurants were the same company, and we were then taken to the middle floor which was void of people!The sushi was okay - We ordered the London and the S\u00e3o Paulo Samba rolls and edamame, but weren't that impressed or i personally didn't find anything outstanding about the meal.It was overpriced and you only got a few pieces for each roll - at about \u00a315-\u00a316 a roll, I thought this was a bit of a rip off if I'm going to be honest. There are so many lovely sushi restaurants around London of far better quality and value.I wouldn't mind if we were paying for the view, but the window was hazed up with moisture which gave London a very 'diffused' focus.I did like the with love from Rio desert, but for \u00a312 a pop, you're going to be expecting some nice flavours going on.Not somewhere that I would try again. I wasn't keen on the atmosphere, price or food.However on that note, the Heron tower itself is very much worth a visit, being one of my favourite places in London, although next time I'll stick to just having a cocktail at the bar or check out the duck and waffle!",

The only thing I don't like is how they rush you throughout your meal as they only allow a certain time for each reservation. I feel that to do this at a restaurant that exceeds a certain price point is just a bit tacky to be honest. We went to dinner with friends that we hadn't seen in ages and wanted to just relax and enjoy our meal. However, we were pressured and rushed to order ASAP and it just didn't feel very relaxing. They obviously value turning tables over a high quality dining experience. For that reason alone, I wouldn't return here with someone I wanted to really catch up with. Would probably only come back with my husband alone when we were happy to have a quick dinner.",

The food and drinks tasted good but for the price were nothing special. The service was decent but definitely felt rushed. The hostess came over to ask us to move to the bar before we even had the chance to pay the bill, as the waitress had not been back to our table. The views are great and the restaurant is very pretty, but for all of the talk about dress code it does not appear that it was being followed. The bar was very crowded and my friends and I chose not to stay. Overall, I would have probably preferred a meal at The Shard.",

Great for visiting company or just that good ole craving for the feeling of superiority that comes from knowing you're higher than over 99% of the rest of London and its inhabitants. At 230 meters, Heron Tower is the third tallest building in London. So there.",

The miso cod is ridiculous, the pork belly is sublime - need I go on? It's sooo good The view ain't half bad either - staring down at the tiny world below from the floor to ceiling windows.

Seriously... really good looking people. I can't even count the number of men (& women) I was checking out as I walked through the bar. This place is so cool... it's up on the 38th floor of the Heron Tower and you have a wonderful view of the city, smack dab right next to The Gherkin. It's trendy, the people are well-dressed, and the drinks are really good. I went into Sushi Samba a few nights ago for dinner and I got a nice window seat (even though it was a kinda cloudy day... surprise surprise). The drinks Pablo something and Shiso Fine were fantastic. The Yellowtail taquitos were like little mini raw fish tacos. The Samba London and Sao Paulo rolls were pretty good. The Salmon Ceviche was alright. Don't get me wrong... if you're expecting authentic sushi, you've come to the wrong place. The fusion of Japanese with South American flair is what Sushi Samba is all about. The menu is creative and although it's not the most amazing fusion ever, they still deliver tasty combinations. Come here for the view and the experience. The atmosphere of the restaurants at The Heron Tower is some of the best in the city.",

I loved the overall decor, the soft orange lighting and general ambiance of the restaurant. Also not bad when you look left or right to see stunning views of London.The food was top-notch. SushiSamba reminded me just how good sushi can be (also reminded me how unfulfilling a mere few pieces can be but such is life I suppose). We ordered the Tokyo Sky Tree and Sao Paulo rolls which were first rate. I thoroughly enjoyed both, but in particular loved the Sao Paulo which had truffle! As a true truffle fiend, I'm not sure how I've never come across truffle laden sushi before. It's one for the books to be sure. Another standout was certainly the black cod miso. I can feel the cod melting in my mouth just typing about it. Drinks were pricey but good. Nothing I absolutely loved (I'd say the drinks tended to be on the sweeter side which isn't quite my thing), but would recommend the smoked plum negroni to other whisky lovers out there.Service couldn't have been better. The waiter was helpful, walking us through the menu and recommending how much to order once he learned it was our first (definitely not last!) time at SushiSamba.Take people here to impress but expect it to cost a pretty penny!",

When I arrived, there was a bouncer and a long line outside the building in the cold weather!! when it was my turn, the bouncer ask me if I have a reservation and I told him yes. He opened his iPad and pretend that he was looking for my reservation then asked me who made my reservation, and when I answered him my hotel concierge he asked me didn't they told you about the dress code policy!! I told him no.. He was rude enough to tell me that my hotel should told me about the dress code for the restaurant and that my dress does not comply with the resturant requirements (I was wearing a sport shoes!!!) and he refused to let me in!! I came from the Savoy Fairmont which is considered an upscale hotel with the same dress that I use to dine in all of the upscale restaurants there and I was never refused the entrance. But in SushiSamba, A bouncer has the right to kick you out in a rude way and to waste your whole night. Customers are not important enough to have a resturant reception at the ground floor to greet and guide them. A bouncer outside the building is enough to humiliate customers and kick them despite the long drive and the difficulty in finding an appointment",

Sushisamba sets itself apart from the other eateries in service, quality, and height. Sipping a cocktail at the outside bar and dining in front of one of the most gorgeous city views was an experience to say the least. Fortunately, the originality and quality of Sushisamba's food was on par with the entertaining visual aspects of the restaurant. The seviche was made absolutely perfectly, the sushi exceeded my expectations, and although difficult to mess up, even the edamame was expertly salted. Lastly, the staff. Sushisamba's employees rose above and beyond what I had anticipated. Upon arrival you are met with an escort for the trip in the elevator. The man immediately greeted us with a warm welcome and proceeded to put a smile on our faces with his personality. Although rather chilly outside the bartender was in great spirits, clearly cold, but still joking and making small talk with other friendly patrons. Our server was lovely and her in depth knowledge in regards to the restaurant's food was very helpful. All in all I had a great experience at Sushisamba and would most definitely return. Also, don't let these reviews about the dress code scare you. I was not dressed to the 9s by any means and was treated with the same amount of respect by the staff as the guy in the full suit next to me.",

It faces north-east-ish (so go for a wander to see the City skyline on the other side) but I had fun trying to spot my flat out towards the Olympic Stadium!Got a taste of the high life on the VIP side of the velvet rope (eek) as our host was buying bottles, which entitles you to escape the rammed half of the bar and score some seats at the outdoor tables.Disappointing then that despite buying a magnum of champagne as we were such a big group, they seemed to try some cheeky upselling, telling our host that they'd run out of the first 2 Laurent Perrier bottles on the list and as such she'd have to go for the third most expensive magnum for \u00a330 more. Lo and behold, after ordering a couple more they mysteriously found some LP after all. Hmm...She also got some bar food in with a haul of edamame bowls (can't really go wrong) and some samba rolls. These were a mega tasty twist on sushi that I hadn't had before - each piece carefully assembled with like ten different ingredients (think crab, salmon, prawn, wagyu, scallop, avocado and more, all in one). Only catch is for \u00a312-16 per platter they each only had 6-8 rolls; now magic in your mouth or not, \u00a32 per sushi piece felt kinda ridiculous.Given I wasn't paying(!) we had a fun eve from pinky sunset until the orange tree sculpture at the centre of the bar lit up in fairy lights and they turned on the gas fires to keep it cosy (it's breezier than you think 38 floors up!).Service still a little slow but can't resist the 4th star for how much I love that view and the lift ride up! I'll still wait for a special treat to go back - but now I also know to go for the rolls over the sashimi, and not to open the samba-music-playing website at work...",

    "text": "I finally got to test out Sushisamba and it was as good or even better than I had imagined. We went there without a reservation which I'm very well aware is a big no no, but we just thought we would try our luck and at least have some drinks in the bar and enjoy the view while we are at it. We went in on a Sunday evening around 7pm and there was still a line outside. So if you want to go there for dinner, be sure to make a reservation at least two weeks in advance! There is also a dress code so dress up people ;) Seriously you won't get in not looking the part. One of the best moments of the Sushisamba experience is definitely the glass elevator ride up to the 38th floor. The view is absolutely breathtaking on your way up.So we got in and put our names down on the waiting list and went to the bar. I ordered a Santazumi and later a Fukuko Cloud from their seasonal drink list; both a variation of my all time favourite drink the Whiskey Sour. They set you back 13 pounds a pop but believe me when I say it's well worth it! The first sip of the Santazumi was just perfection - one of the best drinks I've ever had in my entire life. The other drink was absolutely heavenly too and as it happens the bartender who had created the drink was serving that evening so I got to tell him personally how much I loved the drink. We got a table after waiting about an hour so not too bad. Unfortunately we couldn't get a table in the actual dining room but got a place at the bar which was perfectly fine considering we just walked in. We ordered green bean tempura with black truffle aioli for starters and it was divine. I haven't had tempura that good anywhere outside of Tokio. Amazing! For main we had the Samba London and Yoyogi rolls and the 7 pieces of Nigiri, and I have to say it was some of the best sushi I've ever had - if not the best. The ingredients were impeccable and so delicious I think I died and went to food heaven. The white wine we had was a perfect paring as well, nice acid and kind of tart at first but with the sushi it transformed into pure silk in your mouth. My experience at Sushisamba was nearly perfect but I do have to say that I wasn't completely happy with some aspects of the service. For example when we were seated to our table (or at the bar in this case) the waitress told us very bluntly that \"here is your table, you have it for one hour!\". I thought it was quite rude to be honest - especially the way she said it. Anyway we did get to eat in peace and nobody came to trough us out after an hour but that is still no way to talk to your customers. The cloak room girls and the bouncer downstairs were quite rude as well, but I guess this is the style of the restaurant. I just don't agree with it. I don't think there is any reason to treat your paying customers badly no matter how posh the restaurant is.That being said I'm still giving the restaurant 5 stars since I loved the view, the food, the drinks and the lovely bartenders! Sushi Samba is a must for everyone living in London at least once!",

    "text": "Well finally after over a months wait for my 12pm table it was finally time to see what all the hype has been about!Just a short walk from my office you arrive at the Heron Tower, which is impressive before you even step into the glass sided lift that whips you up to the 38th Floor. Since I'm not a fan of heights I remained front faces during the 30 sec odd ascent, but a brief glimpse showed me that it was a lovely view on the way up.You are greeted by a efficient lady and her clipboard, where they promptly assign you to someone else to take you to your seat. We were not lucky enough for a full window seat, but we did get seated next to the outside terrace so we had a bit of a view.The restaurant has very high ceilings bringing a massive feeling of space and the Asian/oriental style decor compliments the space.Next for the menu & food.... Menu is fairly compact, there are not endless choices which is a good thing especially with sushi are it can sometimes be overwhelming. My lunch date had been before so she recommended a couple of things to try and the other two dishes we just made a call; it's quite difficult to know what some of the items will actually be like, as the descriptions are a bit cryptic! The food we had was very good, excellent flavors and combinations of ingredients - perhaps the portions a tad on the small size but nothing that wasn't unexpected given the place and it being sushi after all. The only thing that was slightly annoying were the wait staff. I'm not sure if it's because they want to get you out quick to turn the table around; they don't have that many tables to attend or they have been trained to be super efficient, but they were constantly at our table - asking if we needed something else and clearing the plates away as soon as the last bite was in your mouth! Obviously the other thing is it's pretty pricey, but given the place, atmosphere and food it's worth a go. I would def like to go again for a special occasion, maybe try it at dinner time and in the summer to sit out on the lovely terrace.",

Our waitress was very helpful in walking up through the menu and giving suggestions, many of which we took. We started with the glazed pork belly crispy taquitos and got a series of large plates as well. The pork belly stood out as the best part of the meal, thought it was all impressive.

After affirming our reservation for a 4pm afternoon snack he lets us on the elevator taking us to the 39th floor where SushiSamba resides. Already our expectations are high. We arrive early for our reservation and are offered an option to sit at the lounge area for drinks or head to our table. We get to our table, examine the menu and the view that we can't really admire due to their patio not being open. We become intrigued by a few of the dishes on the menu and end up with the Samba London and Seabass sashimi..The seabass \u00a0(SUZUKI USUZUKURI), tasted simple. A hint of Seabass and lime. Served COLD which isn't the best way to enjoy sashimi in my opinion. 13 GBP for 6 slivers.The SAMBA LONDON would have you believe it's probably the greatest item on their menu since it's named after the restaurant. It has crab, tuna, salmon, white fish, prawn, scallop, wagyu, avocado, tempura crunch, wasabi mayo, aji panca, house-made soy reduction at 16 GBP for 6 pieces. The quality of the rice was grocery store-esque. There was so many ingredients but the flavours weren't there. The tempura and mayo stood out the most. Rubbish.My date and I agreed on this review. I had no expectations about their food prior to going. This was a first hand experience. Disappointed and not worth the view.",

Next I had the Sao Paulo samba roll, a scrumptious mix of scallop, masago, red onion, tuna, salmon, shrimp, white fish, avocado, truffle, hatcho miso soy, chive oil (yes all in one roll). Utterly delicious. Surprisingly the black truffle paired very well with the avocado and seafood. Overall a flavourful main perfect for sharing and very filling. Will definitely be back!

    "text": "The lift up to Sushi Samba on the top floors of the Heron tower is quite an experience as it shoots upwards above the office buildings and the whole city of London comes into view from above. Some surprisingly narrow corridors connect from the lift to the restaurant. First a bar area with sushi counter plus large outdoor terrace with a big tree in the centre. Another few paces around the corner takes you to the \u00a0restaurant proper which is quite light and airy with another outside terrace. The view is amazing.I've been to Sushi Samba in New York \u00a0several times and it was one of my favourite places to eat there so was interested to try the London location. Not as easy to get a reservation in London vs. NYC where we had just been able to walk in if early enough in the evening but I think it's more of a destination restaurant here with the high up location. The early evening crowd was a mix, youngish with money to flaunt, some people in for the occasion.We were seated right away and ordered. We sampled the rock shrimp tempura, the asparagus and flank steak with Peruvian corn and also the calamari with plantain. These were 'small plates' as almost everything seems to be now but actually varied in size from the shrimp and calamari (largish portions) to the steak (small). The shrimp tempura was good but a bit heavy with the mayo dressing which detracted from the crispiness. Calamari was good and the flank steak was OK but not too exciting.Our small group ordered 4 different samba rolls. Visually very pretty (see pic) and nicely arranged on a large platter. Overall pretty good with some interesting \u00a0combinations and textures. We all enjoyed the rolls but maybe a little too much going on. Heavy on salty flavours and a bit too much mayo toppings. Quite fun to eat but don't order too many like we did. I know it's a fusion concept and not Japanese sushi but busier, bolder, saltier and heavier. I like the taste and texture combinations but we started to wonder if it really had that super freshness of the fish which is critical since it was masked by everything else. We needed more picked ginger to counteract everything else. The wasabi was nice, coarse and not fiery as usual. Maybe this was real wasabi and not the intense green horseradish/ mustard combo which I think I am used to?They do have 'regular' nigiri and sashimi on the menu so maybe a good choice to have one or two rolls and some more standard sushi alongside.Service was polite and efficient. Cost was around \u00a355 / head so not cheap. Good and interesting dishes but not quite as good as the NYC W. Village branch which was also better value. I'd come back to bring visitors for a fun dinner but not especially for the food alone.I veer between 3 - 3.5 stars based on the food / value but overall 4 stars for the whole experience.",

    "text": "Sushi Samba is a great place for drinks, and the food is good if you don't insist on the Sushi side of things. First about drinks. The restaurant is located on the 38th and 39th floors of Heron Tower and has a wonderful view of the city. There is an outdoor patio bar on the 38th floor and it is definitely THE place to be on a nice evening. There is a huge fake tree covered in orange lights inside the round bar area. It is quite impressive and makes for an awesome background for photos. You can actually see it from afar at street level. Inside there are some spiral stairs connecting the two levels and there, you will have the best head on view of The Gherkin. You can hardly walk up or down these stairs without tripping over people taking photos or selfies. Since it is close to the city, you get a lot of suit and tie type here. And girls tend to be over dressed, especially on weekends. However, it is a great spot to come for a drink and admire the city. I often take my out of town guests here.The food. I had to try a few time to finally make a reservation here for dinner. The dining room was lovely with many light bulbs directly hanging from the ceiling. It feels like that you are dining under the stars. The food is Brazilian and Japanese fusion, as the name suggests. My friend and I started our meal with some sushi rolls. Interesting combination, but it was OK. The Steak, foie gras and quail egg, however, was outstanding. That was the first time my friend ever tried foie gras and she was hooked. She still talks about that dish after over 6 months. We then had the seafood mixed rice, which is a typical Brazilian dish. It was delicious, but we wish there were a bit more of it. Overall, I think it is good, but it is a over-priced.",

The room itself is something of a wonder, with hanging lights and views looking out above London with the city lights twinkling below, it really was beautiful. There were plenty of staff who were all attentive which made for a nice effort. The cocktails are delicious, although make sure you try more than one! There is an abundance of choice when it comes to food so choose wisely! The presentation of the food is immaculate and the taste of the sushi was impeccable. I cannot fault anything with the food in sushi samba and would definitely go back again. The only thing that gave me a little bit of a shock was the bill at the end, but I guess you get what you're paying for, so I wouldn't go again unless it was for another occasion where you can go all out.",

Food is average, but the wow factor is the view from the 39th floor.My experience with the bouncers downstairs at Heron Tower is that they're just there for crowd control (wait, I guess like typical bouncers). They may not let you in if you state that you don't have a reservation, or tell you to call some random phone number. If you state that you do have a reservation, however, they have no way of verifying it and just let you up.The lounge area is a nice place to hang out and bringing out-of-towners to see the amazing view from the giant windows. The lounge is also open quite late, so a good place to head to if you're finishing a late dinner somewhere and want to head out for drinks without being bothered to move twice.The food is pretty standard for showy \"fusion\" Japanese (think: Roka, Zuma, Aqua Kyoto) with South American influences. Pricey and nothing very memorable. I've eaten at the Sushi Samba at Park Ave in NY and thought the same. The focus if you're coming here, though, is not the food, but the ambiance. A good place to impress guests/clients from out of town.",

There is very little seating inside - probably to discourage the tourists (which doesn't work), and you'll need to avoid the rush hours (lunchtime and 15:45 on) to be in with a chance of sitting outside.

    "text": "There are 2 things (amongst many) that I adore in life: amazing views, and sushi. I must admit that my better half did a very good combo when booking a table at Sushi Samba for our anniversary - however reading the reviews here, I got a bit scared.So yeah, it is in the higher price range (150\u00a3 for 2 based on 7 dishes, 2 wine glasses and 2 cocktails), and is definitely a hype place full of people speaking Russian with a bit of bling and shiny jewelry. But... we kind of expected that, right?Globally, our experience at Sushi Samba was amazing, and the wow effect starts as soon as you shoot up to the 38th floor while having a view over the City. The decoration fits what it says on the tin: a weird mix between Asian and South American with an orange tang to it all. Service was what one could expect in these kind of restaurants - maybe a wee over serviced to my taste.But the most important in all that is that... OMG THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!Dishes are bold, exotic and a bit extravagant. The products are extremely fresh, tasty and set up with some surprising associations, such as sushi on a bed of pumpkin mousse, mozzarella with salmon on rolls. A bit on the small side, but that also encourages you to take the time and really enjoy the various flavours you get.Desert on my end (cheesecake) was a bit of a disappointment compared to the main dishes, so just try something else - or just skip the desert and treat yourself to a sake :)So in a nutshell - go there to impress, or for a culinary experienceThe positives;- The setting - dinner on the 38th floor definitely has a wow effect- The dishes. Just for the food itself. Sushi samba was worth the experience.- The company, but that doesn't really count in a Yelp reviewThe less positives:- I can't take a point down for the posh/snobby side - as that is what one would expect. However it lacked a bit of cosiness and felt a bit cold.- The cocktails were a bit on the mean side for the price, and the desert was a bit bland even if it looked impressive.I will definitely go back, and focus the budget on the main courses. And probably over the summer to have a closer look at the view :)",

A sexy glass elevator takes you 38 flights above to SushiSamba which is a restauraunt that served food influenced by the Japanese, Peruvian and Brazillian cultures. The three influences are reflected in everything from food, to cocktails and even the music. The food is absolutely and beautifully well done! Everything is meant to be shared, but you'll find yourself reluctant to let your dinner mates share anything as the food is absolutely divine! Try it all and don't be shy - it's worth it!The swanky decor just makes you feel so pretty. (It really does.) Go here to enjoy delicious cocktails upstairs, on the balcony or for dinner in the main room. Easily my new favourite in London!*samba dances away*",

    "text": "Where do you go when you fancy cocktails and a nice dinner with a view? Heron Tower is an easy option in London, and Sushi Samba perfect when you can get a table!the barWe started with cocktails at the bar. Unlike those upstairs in Duck and Waffle I thought they were more hit and miss. My Japanese twist on a negroni, using the plum sake umeshu was pleasant, however some of the other cocktails were too sweet. Perhaps the barman on that evening had a sweet tooth? Anyway we were really here for the food!dinnerThe dining room was a lovely space allowing you see out across London 270 degrees (the kitchen was on the last side). But it did feel a little tight when the tables started filling up. We had a booth at the side of the restaurant, which are obviously the best!We went for a mixture of small and large plates from across the menu. A gimmick to get to you buy more or playing to those like me who like to try everything? The jury is out on that one, but I enjoyed eating my way through most sections of the menu.The shrimp tempura (which looks like a salad) was very nice, with a spicy truffle dressing complementing it. The roll however was not great texture or flavour. I think this was the California maki, but I can't recall, not great when I was that ordered it.The ceviche came with pickled mandarin and mandarin leche de tigre and shiso. Showcasing the restaurants' ability to mix up the traditional from both the Japanese and South American sides of the menu.Mixed feelings on the wagyu gyoza with kabocha puree and probably some truffle (they use truffle oil liberally in here!) These are truffly versatile! I like truffle so the liberal use on most dishes went down a treat with me. Some of my friends weren't so keen. I do believe that truffles should only be used sparingly, where they complement the food in season (i.e. only in Winter!). In this case the gyoza were very tasty, but I don't think they showcase the Wagyu particularly.The samba salad was beautifully presented, but you need to mix it all together to get the flavour combinations. Again this is served with a truffle ponzu dressing, but felt super healthy even with that decadence!Black cod miso was a classic that we had to try. The fish was perfectly cooked and went well with the corn it was served with. Another South American ingredient showcased with the traditional Japanese.The vegetable tempura were great, as long as you like a punch of garlic flavour from the sauce. I loved it!Now for me, the mushroom tobanyaki was the star of the show. Who says the vegetarians don't get any fun? This mushroom dish was rich, seasonal and succulent. The truffle flavour was present again here, but with the richness of 3 different types of mushroom and the just poached egg to stir in, it was sublime. Definitely my winning dish for a Winter's dinner!The grilled poussin with a teriyaki glaze and served with the best Japanese mayonnaise was very tasty (but not a patch on the mushrooms obvs).Trying to be healthy we ordered the aubergine too. You can't go wrong with grilled aubergine - one of my favourite vegetables - but this was slightly upstaged by the mushrooms.By now I didn't need a dessert, but I wanted to try them out....dessertsI had the With Love from Rio - with that name I had no idea what this dessert would be! Turns out that this was valhrhona chocolate ganache (single source from Brazil naturally!), coffee mousse and tonka bean ice cream. The mousse was dehyrdated (it's the stuff that looks like snow!)My friend had the ice cream mochi - mochi are always good! Would you believe that I only tried these for the first time in Dusseldorf of all places?! and the \u00a0Alfajores - deconstructed obviously, but a great interpretation, my friend (from Argentina) gave it a big thumbs up!verdict: Come here for the views, stay for the food, not the cocktails!! A bottle of decent sake was \u00a365 - which went around the five of us nicely, so there are other drink options!",

The only negative experience was the one of the hostess was very rude to my friend and I we noticed people taking photos outside on one of the roof areas next to where \u00a0we ate. After dinner we asked one of the hostess if we could go out there when we were leaving she was condescending and said you need to be escorted out and it's for reservations and asked if we understood what she said. I replied we did have \u00a0reservations and just finished eating. \u00a0 I don't understand why others were allowed out taking pictures and walking around when we had reservations \u00a0too.

We got yellowtail sashimi with jalape\u00f1o, mixed ceviche, Sao Paolo and Sky Tree (name?) rolls, cod skewers with miso sauce and a large plate of various seafood with rice. My particular favourite was the Sao Paolo rolls -- they had chunky portions of fresh sushi with the perfect pinch of truffles to make it the best set of rolls I had ever had. Also great were the yellowtail sashimi (so fresh and flavourfully spicy!) and the cod skewers (very tender and perfectly seasoned). Drinks were great as well. I loved both of my cocktails and would go back just for them as well! Second, service was phenomenal. They came to check up on us every 10-15mins, and they were just delightful waiters with great recommendations to share and top notch promptness in bringing out the dishes. Finally, the ambience is posh and modern as well. Loved the lighting and every bit of decoration. We had our final round of drinks outside with the view, and it was great even in the cold weather. Perfect place for all sorts of occasions.",

We came in this evening, a group of seven, and were seated near the bar on a couch, which was fine considering we were last minute but the entire sushi bar was open...and large enough for our entire party. When I requested it, they said no, there was another party to take it, it was empty the entire time. Each of us got a roll of some sort and a cocktail. My roll was I believe the Tokyo Sky roll, which was delicious. I tried the chucomber cocktail as well as the Nina Fresa, both were refreshing. The mango cocktail looked amazing.My issue here is with our service, it was non existent. We had a waiter who didn't necessarily seem busy, took two of our orders and then walked away for thirty minutes and left the other people in our party not served. \u00a0She came back, and they ordered, but it had to be 20 minutes later. We got our food from a food runner, which did look amazing, we waited a bit as it had been 35 minutes and our cocktails hadn't arrived, asked about our cocktails, got attitude from our server, then decided to just begin eating, we finished our food and ten minutes later she said she was sorry and that she didn't put our cocktails in yet. Needless to say, they finally came twenty minutes after the food was already eaten. She came back and took another two orders which she didn't seem thrilled about, and finally everyone just started ordering at the bar, because she took off on a break (for 20 minutes) without having a relief take over or even a warning.Then came the tab, that had the service charge, we paid it, but honestly there was hardly any service besides the food runners and the sushi chefs. The cocktails and food were delicious, but you had to work to get any type of service when it was a Monday night. This is in a beautiful establishment, one would think service would be exceptional but it just wasn't there.",

We tried to enjoy the patio and take out desert out there, but we weren't allowed to because there was no service out there. That was upsetting because we saw people out there with coffee and drinks. We were willing to be served at our table and bring the dessert out there ourselves. Why do you have a beautiful patio with a gorgeous view and not use it? The Mochi ice cream was really good though!

I have the sat food came so slow and not in a seasonable order at all. The appetizer side burgers came last while they serve sushi and then the cod and other entrees? Were we just too casual?

I was lucky enough to visit for my birthday celebration on my first visit and really didn't find any of the food to be outstanding let alone memorable. Furthermore, drink prices given its location in the Heron Tower are astronomical. I do like the outside bar area but the views from SushiSamba are not all great on the inside unless you are lucky with seating. For the views, it is lovely but the thrill of the dizzying elevator ride was more enjoyable than the food and service I've unfortunately experienced.On my second visit, I just popped by for drinks but found the crowd to be way too formal for my liking. I've visited Sushisamba in the states and much prefer it there. It began as a simple restaurant serving amazing food but unfortunately it parades itself around as a largely overpriced, pretentious restaurant in a prime location near Liverpool Street in London just because it can. Avoid, and go somewhere else where snooty service, tiny portions and insane prices don't overshadow the food served. If you must go for whatever reason, pop in for drinks (look for a big orange tree looking thing for the outdoor area) instead so you can check out the skyline without the disappointing food and quick table turnaround times.",

It was a Saturday night so they were busy however the cocktails were great. After waiting in the bar for around half an hour, we were led to our table which was by the window so we had a beautiful view of the city all lit up. They recommend around 5-6 dishes to share between two people. So we ordered the Edamame, Kuromitsu Glazed Pork Belly, Black Cod, Sea Bass Tempura, Samba London sushi rolls, El Topo sushi rolls. I'm not a big fan of pork but my other half is, however we compromised with me getting the sea bass tempura which he isn't a fan of. The pork however was delicious as was the black cod but the best dish by far was the El Topo sushi. This sushi is a fusion of Japanese and South American, putting jalape\u00f1os, salmon and mozzarella in a sushi roll. Just divine! Sushisamba is one of my favourites restaurants in London however definitely somewhere you would go to celebrate a special occasion in my opinion.",

    "text": "My husband and I celebrated our one year anniversary here! After reading lots of reviews they all recommended reservations and definitely more than the night of. We called hoping for the best but as expected, they could not accommodate us in the main dining room. They said since it was a Sunday evening though that we could take our chances at the sushi bar and eat dinner there. Upon our arrival we checked in with the greeter and she said we were in luck - there were only two open spots at the sushi bar!The ambiance:It was very busy despite it being a Sunday evening. Lots of people standing and enjoying cocktails as well as having dinner at the sushi bar. It was raining and the wind was blowing so sadly they closed the patio. We weren't able to go out there and see the city or get any photos. It was definitely a bummer but for the safety of their guests so I do understand why they closed it.The service:We had two servers all evening and they were both wonderful. They made recommendations of both food and beverage for us. Their saki sommelier even came over and assisted us with specific saki types that complimented our food! This really helped make the experience a \u00a0glowing one!The food:Since it was our anniversary we did NOT hold back. We ordered plantains, tuna seviche, a sasa hand roll, 2 carnival maki rolls, 2 orders of sake sashimi, and 1 order of chef's choice shashimi. It was all absolutely phenomenal. Seriously, that's why we kept ordering more - it was THAT good!Overall, we would highly recommend Sushisamba to anyone celebrating a special occasion or looking to drop a ton of cash in one evening. The service is outstanding, the product is spectacular and the views are fabulous!",

They're amazingly epic! and rivals the shard and sky gardens. and you do kinda get same-ish views on landmarks like the Gherkin. In terms of views, you dont get the same scope but at night, it really is terrific and an experience in itself. Upon entering the floor of Sushisamba, it felt like walking through a really trendy Japanese bar :D Best of all, entry was free with security checks along the way. To get here, you'll be whizzed up on a super fast elevator (abit, well alot like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory glass elevator!!) The loos were amazing! Very japanesy!!! One day, when i'm rich, I'll eat at the sushi bar :D",

Nice since our luggage didn't arrive and we didn't have a change of clothes. This is where the experience went south. \u00a0Once we arrive up at the restaurant (38th floor) and approach the hostess we're promptly informed that could have a table but we would be limited to 1 hour. Ok. I get it. IF you're restaurant isn't half empty! \u00a0As we walk in we see 2 friends sitting at a 4 seat table and ask to sit with them. The bratty hostess tells us \"just sit down\" at the table provided and she\"ll \"check\" to see if we can sit there. \u00a0\"They only have 30 minutes left at their table\" she says. \u00a0Really?! Anyway...the food. \u00a0I order a beer to start. \u00a0It's barely cold and they give me a warm glass to pour it in. \u00a0Then I order the yellowtail taquitos --decent. \u00a0Then then pomegranate tuna ceviche--very small serving of fish absolutely drenched in a tart pomegranate sauce--not good. Last I had a toro (I think) roll. \u00a0It was just ok. Conclusion. Lose the pretentiousness. \u00a0Use common sense. If your restaurant is barely half full don't limit the time at a table and train your hostess to at least attempt to be accommodating to a customers requests. For what you charge, the experience should be better. \u00a0We felt like you were doing us a favor to allow us to eat there. \u00a0Guest what? \u00a0Never again. \u00a0Only reason why you get 2 stars is for the view.",

I had to pry her for an alternate solution about how we could still enjoy the restaurant although the tables were booked. \u00a0I asked about the rooftop terrace (knew about from yelp) and it wasn't until then she said it was open for walk in first come first serve. Had I not asked we would have went elsewhere. Anyway so this review is for the outdoor terrace.Another annoying thing is when we arrived at exactly \u00a04 (we were told the terrace opened at 4) we were told that we could not order from the full menu. Would have been nice for the agent to mention that especially when I was originally inquiring about a dinner reservation. Anyway the menu was short, with a selection of appetisers like edamame etc and a small selection of sushi rolls. We went for the samba roll and the yoyogi roll \u00a0(something like that ). I ordered the lychee cooler which was nice but didn't give me a buzz and I didn't taste any alcohol present. \u00a0We were told it was not possible for the edamame to come first so all the food came out at once. Again a bit annoying. The rolls were very good however. Especially the samba roll.Views were amazing of course. Definitely want to go back to dine in the restaurant with more menu options.",

Unfortunately, our plans got a little flip flopped and we ended up arriving with our luggage, however, the people there were so nice and without hesitation let us store our items in the cloak room. When you walk in there are two men who will ask you for your reservation name and do a quick check if you have any bags. If one of the men is bald with an earring he is honestly the most wonderful! So sweet and made us feel so accommodated. He even gave us a great place to exchange our money down the street. Attentive personnel and great experience. Don't forget to video your ride up and down the elevator!",

    "text": "SUSHISAMBA is definitely a destination dining experience, both due to 38th floor location and the price of its food.The other Yelp reviews are very useful in terms of food recommendations and we particularly enjoyed the green bean tempura a few people mentioned - the black truffle aioli was divine. We also enjoyed the black truffle vinaigrette with the shrimp tempura (which is quite a substantial dish so good if you're hungry).Our delightful and attentive French-accented waiter recommended several other dishes that had frequently popped up on other reviews, including the Samba London and Sao Paolo rolls. I thought they were both pretty good but I almost missed the taste of the fish (which as far as I could tell was fresh a good quality) with all the other stuff going on. If I went back I would try some of the normal sushi too so as not to miss out on the fish.The kobe beef mini burgers he recommended were a disappointment, and at \u00a36 each a rip off compared to some of the very high quality full size burgers you could get at a fancy street food event for the same price. The wagyu gyoza however, was pretty tasty. I didn't really like the yellowtail taquitos which tasted mainly of the not so interesting sauce they were drenched in.The Sauvignon Blanc we had was particular delicious and served by the snootiest sommelier ever, who did not crack a smile or, as far as I remember, speak. Hilariously, he later nearly dropped the bottle when refilling our glasses.The only blip in otherwise good service came at the end when our waiter clocked off and we were ignored and left waiting for the bill, which if I had any regular readers would be known as my pet peeve.We neglected to go out to the restaurant garden which probably had the best views - ironically the restaurant and bar garden look out over slightly less interesting East London (although I enjoyed spotting my old stomping ground of Bethnal Green). The Friday after works drinks crowd seemed pleasant enough, it's definitely a place where people come to be seen. Cocktails were good, I had what was essentially a rumspresso, always a favourite of mine.Overall, although I generally enjoyed my experience, if I were going to spend this much money on a meal again I would choose Duck & Waffle upstairs or Salt Yard or one of the other really pricey London sushi restaurants I haven't tried yet.",

It's location provides amazing views of this beautiful city, unless you are unlucky and a) you don't get a table close to the Windows b) you get a table right next to window overlooking the outdoor space or c) there is too much fog (for which you would blame the weather of course). I have been a few times there and I am always satisfied with the service and how well we are being looked after. Last however that we went, we were 12 of us for a friend's birthday and we spent a few hours eating and drinking. The service was as always amazing and the wine was flowing! We made an agreement with the maitre that we want to pay up to \u00a3100 per person and let the chef prepare for us platters to share and different dishes that would allow us to taste the most popular dishes from the menu. We were surprised with what we received for what we were paying and the quantity of the food and platters. It was not what we were expecting exactly. Including the wine and desserts we ended up paying \u00a3200 per person and we were not that much satisfied either with what we had for dinner. Nevertheless it was still a nice experience and always a place I would choose to go back. Although I prefer the duck and waffle more but that's another story!",

The churrasco rio grande under 'large plates' was also so so good and rich in flavour!! Loved all the sauces it came with and the fact that you could mix and match. We also tried the poussin robata which was excellent as well. All of this was 5/5!!Sushi-wise, I felt like it was disappointing. We ordered Samba London and Tokyo Sky Tree which sound like they would be their most special rolls, but they were a big let down. Really disappointing when you consider it's called Sushi Samba not Everything-Else-Except-Sushi Samba! If I go back, I will make sure to steer clear of the sushi and just eat everything else on the menu!",

I was impressed and surprised at how much better this location is! This is the best location. The ride up to the 38th floor, in the glass elevator, is breathtaking! Such a cool way to get to the top of a restaurant. Our experience, since we checked in at security until the very end was nothing, but incredible! The view from the 38th floor is incredible. I would recommend sitting by the window so you can enjoy an amazing view of the city while eating some of the most exquisite and quality Japanese/Brazilian cuisine. The decor is very unique and modern. I really love the red lit up tree in the outside patio. I also highly recommend making a reservation a month in advance. I was able to book a table for two on the night of, but not until 11 P.M. The dishes are also unique and melted in my mouth. Some of the ones that stood out, are:Tempura Green Beans w/ Truffle SauceTORO (forgot what it's called, it's one of the small plates)Samba London RollKobe Beef GyozaThe ambiance is very hip, fun, and trendy. It's a great place for a night out with your friends or a birthday celebration. Our servers were super friendly and fun to talk to! We even had a few laughs with one of them. Ask for Sebastian, he took good care of my sister and I! He is also very entertaining and made our experience fun! I will definitely come back here every time I visit London. Can't beat delicious food, amazing service, and a stunning view! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in London.",

    "text": "Honestly, pls save your money people. If you after good sushi, pls just go to sticks and sushi. If you are after ambience and having a fine dining experience, pls just go to Nobu. This is what you will experience from Sushi Samba:- Poor table service: dishes are literally placed at the corner of your table with the corners of the dish literally hanging over the edge of the table. Any attempt to try to build rapport with any of the waiters is a lost cause. We said, \"what a nice view you have here!\" enthusiastically only to be responded with nothing. Having spent \u00a3152 for lunch I would have hoped for at least some attentive service. We did not even have a goodbye from anyone as we left the restaurant.- Food is decent but but definitely not worth the money. Ceviche in Shoreditch or Soho is miles better and the sushi from sticks is FAR superior. If you want to just splash out just cuz, then go to Nobu, or Zumba which will offer you better service and food for a similar price. - Decor - the flooring of the main stairs is worn down and beaten up. Same goes for the walls as you exit the elevator of the 39th floor. Please don't be lured by this restaurant like me folks. Just save your money and take your business else where that deserves your hard earned dollars. Hundreds of other places that will gladly take ur money in exchange for decent service and food.",

Sushisamba offers up a unique fusion of Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian cuisine with artistic decor that compliment the stunning views.A glass elevator will whisk you up to the 38th floor so fast it'll make your ears pop, transporting you from the hustle and bustle of the noisy streets below to tranquil surrounds of subtle yet obvious opulence.As expected, once at the top, the views and surroundings are spectacular. The decor is eclectic yet nicely done and adds to the ambience. The outdoor bar with it's large autumn tree centrepiece and the bamboo trellis and lighting in the main restaurant are particularly impressive features.They offer a large selection of cocktails with lots of different options depending on your alcohol of choice, which as expected were very tasty and went down like water.We were particularly hungry so went for the edamame, salt and pepper squid, honey egg plant with sesame, tuna seviche and a large selection of assorted sushi. As it was a special occasion we ended with a chocolate banana cake.Both the food and drink were superb with none of it able to be faulted in any way. I eat a lot of sushi on a regular basis and the food on offer ranks right up there as one of the best i've ever had. It was that good!Let's state the obvious that this place is not cheap. It will put a dent in your wallet but everything about the experience is well worth it. If you're going for a special occasion i'd also recommend booking well in advance as, you guessed it. this great restaurant is extremely popular!",

The meat literally melted in my mouth. The rolls were Ezo and California Maki. I usually never go for California Maki rolls, but this version was made with real brown crab, making it extremely delicious and fresh. The 3 pieces of salmon tasted extremely fresh and were definitely very much worth the cost. My favorite part is actually the outdoor bar with the orange light-up tree. It's extremely cozy and romantic. Great place for a special night with your significant other!Pro Tip: Make reservations in advance.",

We were a table of 8 business people so we asked our server to bring us her favorites to share amongst the group. She started us simple with edamame and green bean tempura. We sampled a variety of small plates and entrees. My two favorites were the black cod - sweet and tender, it is the best cod I have ever eaten, and the crispy taquitos - small fish tacos that literally exploded with flavor upon hitting my taste buds. Our server took excellent care of us. Sushisamba was, for me, a celebration of all five senses. It was an incredible experience and I look forward to visiting again when in London.",

The food, while a tad overpriced, is delicious, prepared to near-perfection, and the portions are tiny. Hey, I didn't say it was perfect.Obviously, they are known for their sushi, but if you're not a fish-eater, like me, they also have some pretty good meat and vegetable dishes that are both savory and memorable. The Mushroom Tabanayaki was both earthy and buttery, and surprisingly filling considering it was all mushrooms. The starters are also great, and I would recommend trying their Wagyu Gyoza, made with some of the highest quality meat around.The drinks, which, dare I say, are pricier than the food, are some of the fanciest and best-tasting I've had since leaving LA. The sake is good, the wine is exceptional, but the cocktails are downright amazing. Some friends and I tried several from their cocktail menu and didn't find a single one that wasn't delicious. If you're a coffee-lover, take my advice: Go for their Caf\u00e9 Millonario. Freaking amazing and super smooth as compared to other espresso martinis, with a dusting of dark chocolate to give it the perfect finish. Yes, it is expensive and you may have to book months in advance to eat at the restaurant, but the bar is always open to the public- just be sure to mention to the doorman that you're going up to the bar so they'll let you in without a reservation- and the view at night is absolutely breathtaking.",

Bonus points for serving dinner also quite late (we had a reservation at 11.30pm) which is great for people flying in on a late flight but still needing dinner.

    "text": "Situated high above the hustle and bustle of London's financial district, SushiSamba is an Asian-fusion restaurant specializing in Japanese cuisine with a South American twist. When I heard that this ultra trendy U.S. micro-chain had opened up a branch in London, I knew that I had to check it out. SushiSamba's menu boasts an eclectic fusion of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian fare, so you can expect to see everything from sushi and ceviche to taquitos and tataki on the menu. Unique and interesting yes, but I'm a California Girl and I take my sushi very seriously. I come from a city where Sushi restaurants are as commonplace as pubs are in London or Gelaterias are in Rome. Would SS live up to my expectations?! I wasn't entirely sure at first, but if the crowds were lining up as eagerly as I had been told, I knew that it was doing something right. And I'm happy to report that after an evening's worth of incredible food and wine there was nothing left to doubt....SushiSamba is excellent!The restaurant occupies that 38th & 39th floors of London's Heron Tower; one of the tallest buildings in the city, so if the food isn't enough to get you excited the astonishing near 360 degree views certainly will. The food is on the pricey-side, so I'd definitely coin this as a \"special occasion\" restaurant, but the quality and presentation certainly make every morsel worth it. I dined on Salted Edemame with fresh lime (a nice South American twist on the Japanese classic), a lipsmackingly delicious plate of Rock Shrimp Tempura with black truffle vinaigrette & spicy mayo, and a Samba London Roll; a tantalizing surf & turf concoction of crab, tuna, scallops, yellowtail, salmon, prawn and Waygu beef mixed with avocado, mayo and a soy reduction. I literally could have written an article on this dish alone. It was bright, colorful, creative and jam packed with texture and flavor. But I wasn't done there. I also tried 3 kinds of Sashimi Omakazi (chef's choice). Nine melt-in-your-mouth slabs of salmon, tuna and turbot served over a bed of crunchy daikon and crushed ice. To drink, the house Sommelier suggested a dry, well-balanced Sauvignon Blanc which paired perfectly with my meal. The wine's crisp qualities cut through the fattiness of the fish while its smooth mineral finish complimented the food's clean taste. And then on to dessert.. oh yeah! \u00a0I gorged on a gooey Chocolate Banana Cake and Mochi ice cream paired with a delicious glass of Els Pyreneus, Maury Grenat dessert wine from Roussillon. My mouth is still having wet dreams thinking about that cake! Now for the uncomfortable truth....the bill staggered around the 100 pound mark. But if i'm honest, considering the quality of the menu, the impeccable service and the amazing surroundings, it was definitely worth it...just maybe not every week!",

Immediately the colorful and beautiful reception and bar area of SushiSamba greets you. The views are stunning, breath taking and amazing all at once. The minute I walked onto the patio bar area I almost felt I was on holiday. There you stand under a giant orange-colored artificial tree that is the focal point surrounded by comfortable seating areas. There's a fire-pit and the staff told me some other heating elements would come into play as the weather changes. We were escorted to our table, which was a lovely banquet half circle in the middle of the dining room encompassed by floor-to-ceiling glass. The popular use of old-style filament bulbs is amplified as they have covered the entire ceiling area with what appears to be a few hundred that provide a warm glow after the sun sets. Warm colors are used through out and interesting textures abound. According to my friend who dined with us this restaurant is far more impressive than the New York location. The menu has a nice selection of Brazilian, Japanese and Peruvian inspired foods that the table shares. We started with tempura rock shrimp, edamame and tempura green beans with a black truffle aioli. The rock shrimp... well umm... ROCKS and the other two were great as well. Our server did a fantastic job and made helpful suggestions as we picked other items to share. The flank steak melts in your mouth and the sushi was fresh and flavorful. Our first two picks for wine were already sold out however we ended up with a nice white from Portugal that didn't break the bank. They have only been open a short time so they're working through what I'd call minor kinks but overall it was a fantastic dining experience. After dinner we moved out onto the other patio area where you have an awesome view of the 30 St Mary Axe (The Gherkin), Tower of London, Tower Bridge and The Shard as well as many other sights of London. If you are looking for an impressive place to dine SushiSamba is worth it and made my birthday seem quite special. I found it delicious, delightful and one of my new favorites y'all, I almost want to keep it to myself. Alas my Momma taught me to share, so this American Southerner says it's a must try and maybe I'll see you there.",

There were five of us so we had lots of dishes to share. I would highly recommend the tempura shrimp as all of us loved it and said it was the best shrimp we have had. Perfectly light and crispy with an amazing sauce. Then dishes kept coming! Had it not been a business I would have been snapping photos. The cocktails were very delicious. I had a Nina Fresa to start, I do wish it would have been a larger drink as it was very refreshing. I then tried the Padron Pepper Caipirinha. \u00a0Wonderful almost smoky flavor that paired well with the meats that were served at the same time by chance. Managed to also have dessert. Two of us had the chocolate banana cake. I didn't think I would be able to eat dessert and we both finished it off. It was a great end to the meal. The glass elevator ride was a great view but it was a rainy evening. I would love to go back in warmer weather and dine on the outside patio to enjoy the view. We did have to get security checked before going up the elevator. \u00a0Not a problem, just wanted all to be aware.",

Sushi is something people are prepared to spend up big on. Let's fuse the two and hit hard!From the 6 dishes I tasted, it was the most pure Japanese that were impressive. Well, even as I wrote that last sentence, I realised it wasn't entirely true... The yellow tail taquitos are excellent and amazingly tasty, but the tempura prawns lacked the finesse you would expect. Wagu gyoza was more than simply beef.. I would order that again. The London Roll was very good sushi, with sauces on the side. I can only describe the Tuna Seviche (sic) as a miss; way too much flavor competing with the delicate fish. Overall, the food is a 4. The overall score must be reduced as result of the rushed and overly opinionated service. Will try once more, and revise this review if appropriate.",

It is in an interesting location, because it is relatively high up, but beyond that, skip it. The staff are snobby, or perhaps depressed, it was hard to tell. We went on a sunny day and walked up to the outside bar for drinks. We were handed a drink menu, decided, ordered, and were told we couldn't order drinks there - only wine. We were sent to their TINY, totally understaffed, totally crowded bar inside for our drinks. It took AGES to order, and ages for them to make it. As usual in London, the drinks hardly had any alcohol in them but looked cute. It was seriously overpriced. I've been to the one in Miami Beach, and in NYC, and I loved them both. The London one is crappy because it is just so... Uncool, and un-chic, and lacking in service and friendliness. Sad. Oh well...",

Being from America, I never receive service like this and would not expect this at one of the most highly acclaimed restaurants in London. They finally brought me out a new roll and charged me for 2. After arguing with the waitstaff they finally took it off. My friend had the black cod and it was good but a very small portion as expected. The rest of us had sushi rolls that were OK at most.",

When we complained about a mixup that meant one of our party had eaten a dish intended for two people and we had to order an extra one, one of the managers actually laughed in our faces. Eventually we got the discount that we requested, but we were made to feel awkward and, considering we had spent a lot of money, it seemed petty to behave so rudely when we had made a perfectly reasonable request - the mistake was theirs, not ours.Yes, the views are fantastic, but I'd rather go somewhere with a better vibe.

    "text": "Sushisamba has breathtaking views of the London skyline but the visuals are not enough to excuse indifferent service and shockingly mediocre sushi at outrageous prices.My wife and I arrived at Sushisamba but still had to wait an inexplicable fifteen minutes for a table while the dining room sat mostly empty. The best views in the restaurant are from the bar where the top of the Gherkin Building is at eye level. This alone might justify a trip up to the restaurant, but stay in the bar and pay for a beer to absorb the sights.When we finally got to our table, we ordered the large omakase for \u00a355. Omakase is supposed to be a series of sushi pieces of the chef's selection designed to highlight the freshest \u00a0fish available. Instead, we received what was basically a chirashi bowl of salmon, tuna, shrimp and other sashimi pieces so typical they could have been ordered off of the lunch menu of any sushi restaurant in any city for a quarter the price. Many of the pieces were bland and not fresh.Despite the beautiful views, SushiSamba was a highly disappointing experience.",

When we arrived, we got \"big-dogged\" and was told by the host that table was now being held for the chef's friend. When we got seated to a random table, no less then 4 people asked if we wanted to order drinks, in the first 10 minutes. An hour in, we ordered a couple drinks because they would not stop asking and we thought maybe there was a drink minimum. \u00a0we got a couple of cups filled with crushed ice and little bit of water down fluid and a stick ($24USD). The waiter suggested and swore by the fried squid. It was crap. It reminded me or a \u00a0bag of stale pork skins minus the seasoning. I also got some miso soup, which was the worst and most expensive miso soup I've ever had. We ordered some other appetizers, some steak think, pork belly, tempera shrimp; all pretty good, but not worth the cost at all. Also ordered 2 or 3 sushi rolls. Again, good, but not anywhere near worth the money. Service was pretty questionable too. It wasn't bad, just lackluster. Floaters would come around, but seemed bothered if we asked for something, and we seemed to be always looking for our waiter. For the type of money we spent (over $100USD a person) I expect the waiter to telepathically read my mind. All and all a pretty crappy experience for the kind of reviews this place has. if you come, its 100% for the views.",

    "text": "*** Tourists Beware ***Although I did not expect to get a reservation the day before, when I called they let me know I could bring my wife to the bar for some drinks and to enjoy the view. We only had a day of vacation remaining and wanted to do something special, so we journeyed to SushiSamba (it is a journey for tourists, as it is not near any of the tourist spots) ... only to be turned away. The first explanation was that there was no room, which did not make sense given that it was 4:30pm. They explained that a special reservation was using the bar area. Interestingly, when I asked why reservations did not mention that -- instead inviting us to come -- the response was that reservations doesn't always know what they're doing. Because that is simply impossible to believe given how important reservations are to this establishment, I asked whether that meant that customers should not rely upon or trust reservations. Naturally the answer was no, and that is when the next line of reasoning emerged. The door man next explained that there was a \"smart elegance\" dress code (note: the website clearly states \"smart casual\"). While we were not in bespoke suits (we had been touring all day!), I was wearing a button-down, jeans, and a Barbour jacket, and my wife was wearing dark washed designer jeans and a Patagonia jacket. Certainly \"smart casual.\" As the prior explanation clearly was not the case, I then concluded aloud that the dress code was the only issue at play, to which he said if we wanted to go home, change, and come back when the bar was lighter that 'may' work. Given that this was only supposed to be a quick drink with a nice view to conclude a lovely London trip, it is not hard to imagine that we had no interest in spending another \u00a340+ round trip cab fare, only to arrive at much more popular time and 'may' get in. No thanks. I am not a routine reviewer, but I felt compelled to provide this insight to anyone - particularly tourists considering spending their precious vacation time to make the inconvenient journey. I only wish we'd googled this issue beforehand, as there are many other similar or worse stories (see, e.g., telegraph.co.uk/women/wo\u2026). There are too many other wonderful options in London to risk wasting the time and effort with SushiSamba.",

The view speaks for itself; London has surprisingly few options for sky bars, and this is a gem in the middle of the City. This venue is so different than the Sushi Samba I went to in New York; the chain has done well in picking a unique location and making it a trendy bar as well. The place is decorated as if it's straight out of the Great Gatsby, over the top with chandeliers and bright colours. We tried to order food but that's impossible unless you have a table; there's no option of ordering at the bar or anything like that. I ordered the Nina Fresa and we walked around to enjoy the views before leaving to get food somewhere else.",

    "text": "Exciting news...Sushisamba, the great Latin Japanase fusion restaurant from NYC has arrived in London. Taking over the top floors of Heron Tower, expect to be wowed by great panoramic views of London....it's possible to even see the well-lit Olympic Stadium and the adjacent red monstrosity that is the Olympic Orbit from the expansive walls of glass. The space itself is stunning...be sure to check out the roof-terrace bar, complete with fire pits and an amazing central bar wrapped around a gold coloured tree (see pic). The dining room has soaring ceilings, hundreds of drop down unique lights, and a great overall buzz. Sushisamba is definitley a see and be seen venue.As for the food, it did not disappoint. \u00a0We ordered the trio of sashimi tiradito... basically marinated sashimi...the salmon in a ponzu sauce was fantastic. Other standouts were the wagyu gyoza and black miso cod. I also enjoyed the big-eye tuna roll. The only item that disappointed was the El topo roll...but mozzarella on fish...not sure what my friend was thinking when he ordered that. Prices are as high as the elevation of the restaurant, but not outlandish for the food.Based on looks alone, Sushisamba is worthy of 5 stars. However, truly dreadful service knocks it down not one but two stars. The team clearly has a lot of kinks to work out...the staff is not ready for prime-time and really left us disappointed. First, whilst at the bar, I saw two separate instances where the bar staff was pushy and up-selling customers to buy bottles of wine instead of glasses. Although not super busy (it was a Monday night), it took a while to be served. When we were seated at the table, we were asked not once but twice asked to move tables.... because they screwed up and needed to \u00a0push tables together to accomodate a larger table. They also asked another table to move after we refused to move a second time.... restauranteur rule one...don't ask people to relocate after you seat them! The sake sommelier was also very pushy/annoying (and not so informed about sakes) clearly directing us to the most expensive bottles. She needs training in professionalism and more knowledge about sake. The waiter was also a bit unprofessional at times and made weird jokes where it was unclear if he was being rude or funny. Lastly, while we were warned that the food comes out as it is made, the waiter brought out 8 of our 10 dishes all at once and all within the first 10 minutes...which was just silly to be honest and probably should have been better spaced...ie give people a bit of time to enjoy their edamame before bringing out the mains. The waiter should have seen there was no room on the table before continuing to rapidly bring out dishes.Despite the dreadful service, I'm willing to give sushisamba another chance...the space is killer, and if they can work out their opening issues and up-level the service to an acceptable level, this could easily be one of the top asian fusion spots in London, but for now it is a mediocre 3 stars.",

    "text": "I would give Sushi Samba zero stars if I could. This restaurant is the type that treats their customers with zero respect and they believe that is the cool and hip thing to do. The food is only okay. In my opinion, I believe they are taking a lot away from sushi which is in itself a complex and delicious cuisine. It is the attitude of our waiter that upset me so much that I will never recommend this place to anyone. He actually snorted at me when I tried to pay for the bill while my boyfriend was in the restroom. Then, he laughed at me with a cook behind the sushi counter and THEN refused to take the check from me. A. It is none of his business if I want to pay for our meal. It is no ones place to judge us. B. How dare him for laughing at me. Why would any decent human think that's okay? It made me feel EXTREMELY awkward to sit there trying to wave him over and have him refuse. So, if you're in for over priced okay food with the worst service I have ever experienced- go for it. If you're into that kind of thing, it's the best crap ever.",

    "text": "We managed to bag a reservation to this place and took our parents to show them the sights and try the food we had heard so much about.Everyone knows where this place is, so I won't harp on about the view, suffice to say its of London in panoramic and it's amazing.The restaurant is funky and modern, seating is comfortable and in most you can make the most of the view. The staff are all top notch, very quick and attentive and they know the menu! (To me this is what separates some restaurants from others, invest in your staff) We went for a selection of food, some sushi, mains and starters. The food is all interesting with the fusion aspect. Mostly ordered on recommendations. Everything we had was very tasty. Although I loved the overall experience I couldn't help think that you are paying for an experience rather than the food, and there is no point denying that it's expensive to eat here!! To be completely honest I've had better food in other Japanese fusion restaurants..... But not always the service, and never that view (apart from duck and waffle, lol) I'm never going to be a regular here but I'd definitely come back if invited.",

    "text": "Based near Liverpool Street, inside the Heron Tower is Sushisamba bar and restaurant. Both the bar and restaurant are pricy. My boyfriend and I had booked a table at Sushisamba in July, the actual date of our reservation was in September as that's how far in advance you need to book! We were expecting to be blown away by the food but it just didn't happen for me. Some dishes were very tasty but some dishes I wasn't very keen on. The menu is quite confusing so we had to have the waiter explain it to us. Nonetheless, it was a nice evening and the restaurant has a nice and chilled ambience. Our meal in total, with a bottle of wine, came to \u00a3250 roughly. We went to the bar afterwards and had a few cocktails. The cocktails are great, I'd definitely recommend going to the bar but not sure if I'd recommend the restaurant as the food wasn't quite as good as I expected it to be. I would have rated it 5 stars if the food was more enjoyable.",

The only painful part is the price, but what do you expect when you ride a lift 39 floors to get to the place?I admit I haven't eaten here yet. I've only bummed around at the bar. The mango cocktail is delicious. There's one bartender who's hilarious, and if you tip them and chat with them, they are more than willing to pour what's left in the shaker into a separate glass for you or top you off with an extra splash of liquor.",

    "text": "I could not believe the look I got when I tried to go and eat in this place. It was absolutely ludicrous! Me and my friend went to go and eat here, with it supposedly having the best rooftop view as it is 43 floors up above the ground, I really wanted to see it. When we arrived at the door, the girls before us, dressed in heels and their hair done etc, were smiled at and spoke to nicely. They didn't have a reservation but they were allowed to go inside.However, me and my friend behind were not allowed in, because we didn't have a reservation and from the look that she gave us (swift full body check out) she didn't think we looked suitable to go inside. I was so angry, we had been struggling to find it all day in London, and when we got there, this happened! I shall not be trying again. As is clear, would not recommend to anyone of working class, unless you wear your best clothes.",

    "text": "Sushi Samba is pretty good. You go there for the view as well as the food.They have a cocktail bar which is pretty good, a club section which is only really open at weekends, a sushi bar where you can grab a quick bite to eat, a restaurant area where you can have a fancy meal with an excellent view over London (which has outside seating with a view), as well as another outdoor area which is (I think) unique in London, being so high up. It's a shame you can't see as much from it.The sushi is quite pricey and quite good, but the place is let down by the poor level of service and lack of chilli sauce. The only one they have tastes ok but is massively oil based so you can't have too much of it.I much prefer Duck & Waffle upstairs, but they are different kinds of food and you won't fail to impress anyone by taking them here (unless they are afraid of heights)!",
