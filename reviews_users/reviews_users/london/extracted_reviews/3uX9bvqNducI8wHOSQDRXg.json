Good thing I did as they were serving meaty-salad less sandwiches at the conference.As for sagar - I started off with pappadums that were quite OK, nothing out of the ordinary. However, the spicy orange curry accompanying was devine. It was all about that curry!For mains, I had the potato-cauliflower curry with lemon rice. Again, decent without being out of the way gorgeous. I did however enjoy the fact that it wasn't greasy as some Indian food tends to be. The lentil soup to along with the dish was good, deserves 4 stars.For drinks, I had fresh orange juice and again, just OK - a 2.5 starI would definitely go back for another quick lunch, but it is a bit too basic for dinner.",

That means to your a selection of tiny tubs of tasty curry on a big metal tray all to yourself. It's a fabulous budget lunch and a perfect way to warm yourself up if you've been wondering around Covent Garden in winter. As Zara L mentioned, they do tasty looking lunch boxes that you can take away, all healthy veggie food. What's even better about this place is that it's not that greasy and the service is quick so it's a perfect lunch spot. All the tables are quite close together so it's good if you want an evening spot with great atmosphere. A nice cosy restaurant. They have 3 branches and I'm tempted to do try the others too. Anyone with food intolerances should try this place, they have an onion and garlic free menu, wheat free and also a nut free selection, very impressive.",

On this strangely hot day, 27 degrees in London at Easter, we needed something tasty that would suit the weather so we decided to head to Catherine Street to check out the Southern Indian food at this branch of the small Sagar chain. We have often eaten at the Hammersmith restaurant and have always left happy with very little damage done to the wallet so this seemed like a good choice for cheap eats in the bustling tourist heart of the beast. Despite arriving at 5.30pm the downstairs room was almost full of folk busily chowing down and chatting away; as you would expect it was mainly tourists but I took it as a good sign that at least half the crowd appeared to be from India or thereabouts. The room itself is plainly furnished but has a nice vibe and is very laid back; no airs or graces here. We quickly gave the all vegetarian menu the once over and after a bit of debate, and checking out what the friendly Indian family next to us were eating, we opted to go for one pre-theatre set meal and one paper dosa which we planned to divide up and share. There is a great selection of dosa's on offer and the thali is a good choice is you are really hungry and fancy a full on meal. Our food arrived quickly and looked and smelled fine. The paper dosa, a lentil and rice crepe kind of thing, was huge. It came with some delicious sambar and curried potato and drew astonished looks from around the restaurant. The pre-theatre special came on a very fetching metal tray and consisted of a couple of curries, salad, raita, some lovely flavoured rice and a strange dessert of liquidised lentils and condensed milk. As we were sharing our food we asked for another plate which was brought with a smile. Half an hour later we admitted defeat; we had given it our best but we just could not manage to finish the very crisp, tasty paper dosa. Stuffed, but feeling full rather than bloated and heavy, we asked for the bill. We had washed down our food with a large bottle of Kingfisher larger, which was a great compliment to the food, and we still got back plenty of change from a twenty pound note which is a real bargain in this part of town. I look forward to feeling hungry in Covent Garden again before too long",

Service was quite slow and my server was a bit rude. Luckily the proprietor or manager came to bring me cutlery, the drink I'd ordered, etc. when my server could not be bothered. Overall, the dullest of the six or seven Indian meals I've had on the visit to London, and by far the least healthy--starches, starches, and barely a vegetable to be found. And this at a vegetarian restaurant. I would never go back. It's also an extremely loud small space so it was not pleasant, but that's not the fault of the restaurant but the result of loud, loud, somewhat drunken groups that were there the night I was.",

My very first experience with Indian food was in London more than 12 years ago, and ever since then I have prized the city's special wealth of Indian flavor. After talking up the Indian scene in London to my partner for years, I finally had the chance to take him out for some. Imagine my disappointment to find that the dishes in this place were absolutely flavorless. Everything tasted like tomato sauce. For 45 pounds we had 4 plates of what I can only characterize as British-ized bland rubbish and 2 glasses of wine. Do not recommend.",

I think the flavours were toned down due to localisation, and the rasam was not as tangy as I would like. The idli was a bit softer than I'm used to (no one in the restaurant was eating with their hands, so no issue there...), but tasted good! I would visit again and try the uttapam. The thali looks very good too but looks like a lot of food...perhaps for a party of three or more.",

Of course there's more to it than that, but those are the classic South Indian dishes.

I wish the waiter would have told us that the TWO SOUPS we ordered is actually in our main entree as well - I would have saved some seriously dough if he told me that. I know they want to make money, but still - would be nice to let your customer know that they would be getting it TWICE.Also, I've noticed they recycle a lot of this one curry throughout the entire meal. I seriously got it 3 times on 3 different entrees / selection. It's not just a side that it comes with, but it is seriously part of the dish. Very interesting.Anyways, what I do like is that it has a \"onion and garlic free\" menu. Pretty nice. I haven't seen that at any Indian restaurants before, so I will give it \"thumbs up\" for having that. I might come back, but I feel like I'd probably want to try out other restaurants, or stay with ones that really whoa me in London when I visit again.",

I didn't realize this until this morning when I looked on the website. Yikes!!I was on a trip to London and didn't know the area really well. A friend and I were in the middle of Covent Garden and didn't know where to go. I'm vegan, so most places is off limits for me. I pulled up my yelp app, typed in vegan, Sagar showed up - friend said Indian is fine. And off we go! It was only 5 mins from where we were. A decently-sized Indian restaurant. I ordered the Aloo Ghobi and I asked to do it less spicy, which they accommodated. The food was really good and reasonably priced.The Aloo Ghobi I ordered is vegan (thank God!), but I had some bread, too, and I'm not sure they are vegan and I have forgotten the name already. Looking at some of the descriptions on the web menu, the bread I ate was probably not vegan :( . \u00a0Lesson learned, always confirm whether something is vegan even if I think it is.

I appreciate that they don't faff around, though I can see that the food most likely isn't made fresh to order. That's not at all a complaint either, just an observation! It makes things quick if you're in a rush.The onion bhaji's were not the best I've had but still tasty. All the curries we tried were super tasty and portioned perfectly. The mango lassi was also super good, and in a huge glass so is definitely worth the \u00a33.45 price tag. In all I would definitely come again, and bring my vegetarian and vegan friends.",

I have had better indian food, but given the fact that's in the middle of the touristy part of town - i kind of knew what i was walking into. Staff is very attentive, but....here are my two reasons for -2 stars:1) a gentleman who was my server would not smile, he seemed grumpy and to some of my questions he wouldn't even answer, he would just offer a pointing finger as an answer in complete silence. 2) the little clique of 3 guys (owner's son is possibly one of them, if my stereotype recognition mechanisms are correct) that was hanging out in kitchen was...just a little silly, with observing the guests in a rather small and cramped space and pointing fingers to the dining hall, clearly discussing the guests amongst each other. A bit unprofessional.",

Sambar was nicely spicy - I could taste the spice so might even be too hot for non-spice lovers.Some nice uncles as waiters. \u00a0Not overly friendly but quick service.",

Having said that, my friend ordered a thali dish which was both delicious AND filling - I know this because I ended up polishing off her dish too! Another good point is that it was very well priced - our food bill was under \u00a315 per person.Service was OK, they were friendly, but a bit slow and not overly helpful when it came to suggesting dishes. Overall, this is quite a nice place if you choose the right dish and it's great for veggies and vegans too.",

The idli, Masala Dosa, Uttapam - all dishes I ate regularly whilst out there, and which I've yet to find in British Indian restaurants here in London. It really took me back! Flavours are authentic - although maybe not quite as spicy.It's true what others say about the service - I can't say the waiters were at all friendly or welcoming. But they did their job and service was pretty quick overall. We didn't feel rushed to leave after we finished eating which was great, and the restaurant remained consistently busy throughout the evening. For a vegetarian option I definitely recommend this very affordable little spot hidden just behind Covent Garden Piazza.",

The carnivore inside me was a little disappointed about the vegetarian nature of the restaurant, but as the rain started to pour we decided to give Sagar a try. And what a good choice!I was delighted by the variety on offer in both the food and the wine menu, and even learned there is such a thing as vegetarian wine (although I still can't say I fully understand it...). The food is fantastic; being a vegetarian wouldn't be so hard if I could make vegetables taste so sumptuous. The staff was very friendly and warm, and the setting intimate in the small venue. It's easy to forget the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden when you tuck into a tasty serving of tarka dal, washed down with a Spanish Albarino. And for its central location close to somany tourist attractions, the price isn't exorbitant. I am looking forward to my return visit to try the lentil pizza.",

The dosa itself was wonderful, both crispy around the edges and \u00a0with enough starch to hold up to the fillings. I've never been willing to pass up on a rava masala dosa when I see one, and I'm glad I didn't here. The filling always reminds me of the filling from a samosa; although the flavors aren't the same, it's a similarly delicious potato-based filling.

(They're good, but not the best value.)The service was generally fast and efficient, though occasionally a little slow on refilling our water. (Not always good if ordering something spicy!)",

Husband had a poori, paratha, and gol guppas as well (he was on a carb binge). Gol guppas were old and stale \u00a0and hard as a rock, but the rest of the items were well received by him.Service is disorganized, hence the 4 star rating. Waiters were unfriendly and we had to wait for the check after asking several times. Food came out quickly though.Location is great, ambiance is nice enough for a casual Indian restaurant, and prices are quite reasonable.We'll return for sure.",

The waiter came by 3 times to see if my friend was done eating, and she literally had to shove the food into her mouth so that he could clear up the table (we were a table of 3 and they were wanting to seat a larger group that was waiting outside). We had been there maybe 30 minutes, and we were already being ushered out. When another waiter came, he asked us if we wanted to see the dessert menu. When I said yes, he immediately said \"well, can you be fast since we have other people waiting for your table?\" Why would you offer the menu if you didn't want us ordering from it in the first place? I literally shut the menu and said never mind, and they immediately came back with the bill. As we were standing up, our chairs and table were being pulled away to accommodate the larger group. Word of advice: don't make your customers feel unimportant and rushed. Such rude staff, I don't recommend - I'm definitely not going back.",

    "text": "After leaving the British Museum, mum wanted to eat South Indian food, and so checked on Yelp, and this place came up with pretty good ratings. So headed here and lucked out as it wasn't too busy with the pre-theatre dinner crowd and their upstairs tables were all free when we got there around 7pm, but by the time we left, were filling up. The host was very kind and originally had given us a seat near the front door, but when mum said it would give her a head cold, he moved us to the upstairs dining area.The food is all South Indian and we ordered for drinks a sweet lassi and a falooda (both fantastic) and then split an entree of Upma (a bit bland, but accompanied by killer tomato and chilli chutney, that spiced it up) and then a paper masala dosa, (really crisp) and a onion rava masala dosa (great taste!). The total was just under \u00a330 so not a bad deal. Pretty good food, responsive service and cost not too expensive makes this a winner for the area.",

No explanations and the contrast was very stark, even my 13-yo commented on it. The restaurant wasn't very neat either. As I said, food was ok. You can try it in a pinch, if you have a sudden craving for South Indian vegetarian food.",
