Had a dull moment a while back when I ordered something which turned out to be a pudding by accident so along with everything else out came some deep fried loveliness with ice cream. I've never found anything bad just wish the portions were a little more generous. The lazy sumday is a bit of a challenge as you have to eat loads to make it good value.",

They didn't come back when my glass was empty to see if I would like another, or when the food was gone we waited a long time for attention when we were asked if we wanted dessert not if we would like to order any more dishes which came as a surprise to me. They had the potential to get more money out of us!So, no extra drinks and no extra dishes....we went for dessert at Starbucks with a cheescake and coffee...pity Ping Pong missed out this time as on other occassions we have enjoyed our dinner there.",

I'm not really a fan of gristle or fat on meat, which you can tend to get in a lot of Chinese restaurants.But Ping Pong is polished dim sum, there is no poor quality meat to be had here.My usual list of things to order are: Traditional sticky rice parcels, the jasmine tea (with the ball!), chicken puff, har gau, spicy chicken and vegetable dumplings and char sui buns. This is usually enough for two people and me and my friend always eat them in a particular order as well.I like the dark decor as well, its very masculine and the seating is generally good. Though beware the curved tables at the back in this outlet, as although they have a great view are rather cramped when the food comes. Ask if you can sit downstairs if possible, it's equally as nice. There are couple of these around town, but I would say that this one has the best location and the best seating despite it not being the largest.",

    "text": "Not at all unlike eating dim sum in a nightclub. It's nothing authentic, but a fairly swish operation, with decent quality ingredients and drinks abound. The ordering process is more than a little bewildering, and though the waiting staff do offer to help out with choosing and so on (a la Wahaca), I got the feeling they wouldn't put themselves out too much. Pah, maybe they're just busy. We had cocktails to start off with, which possibly wasn't the smartest move, but we had to wait for a table. They were worth it though, unusual and very well made. However it meant that tastebuds were somewhat dulled when we were seated and the tea came along. The teas are great and quite well sum up the whole experience - far from authentic but snazzy. The flowering teas open up when they are poured. Nice touch. Anyway, back to the food. Ordering is done by ticking boxes on your own lottery-esque ticket. Pretty standard stuff on display. In addition to a large array of dumplings, we tried a few pork buns, soft shelled crab and a chef special chilli prawn concoction. All the food was tasty, yes. Didn't set my world alight, but it was tasty, arrived quickly and made me happy. Ping Pong do a Dim Sumday on Sundays, eat all you can / like for \u00a317. It's not a bad deal for Ping Pong, as it's not a cheap place to go on a regular day, but the formula works. Fresh, quick, accessible. People leave happy.",

I've only eaten in Ping Pong once (the City branch), and that was more than enough. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that this restaurant has going for it is the ambience. The portions were small and the food was bland at best. Definitely not up to the standard of restaurants found in Chinatown even the not-as-nicely-decorated ones. The dishes were rather pricey too. While I did not try the drinks here, I'm told by an alcohol-loving friend that this place has some incredible cocktails.",

Well, Ping Pong's baked 'Pork Puff' that's what's not to like. This was the first dish to arrive to our table and it was essentially a mini sausage roll that someone had poured honey onto. Sickly sweet and unpleasant, it did not fill me with high hopes about the rest of the meal.Fortunately, this was as bad as it got and although the Soft Shell Crab was greasy, all three of the steamed dim sum we chose were delicious. The service was very quick and efficient but I resented the waitress encouraging us to over order. Three to four dim sum each seemed a bit over the top and these dishes weren't cheap. In fact, being a big fan of dim sum I noticed that these prices were at least a pound more than anything you would pay in China town. Ok, you get to sit in sleek surroundings and sip cocktails but frankly I prefer my dim sum with a little more character and would rather sit in some weird Chinese back room restaurant than have another watery 'Lychee and roses' cocktail for \u00a36!",

    "text": "Dim sums in every shape and flavor is a way to describe Ping Pong. There are lots of Ping Pong's in different areas in London, therefore a safe option to find one in your part of town.In my opinion this place is perfect for visitors who like to put little bits and bobs together. The choice is extensive and for those who have a hard time making up their mind, there are set menus.You get a pencil to tick the right menu box for the dim sum chosen. Ping Pong recommends 4-6 dishes each, which mean a table for two will be covered by all sorts of dim sum baskets in every shape and form. 'Surprise' is the right word to describe the dumplings you choose, as you do not know what it tastes like before you have tried each of them.I little tip, ask the waiters to not bring everything at once - it is a shame when food gets cold. The place is an experience, it not only holds surprises for you but also engages with the customer interactively. You will not get bored and you need to be skilled in eating the dim sum with chopsticks.",

Meat eater or veg, they can accompany for both with equal rights seriously how many times have you gone to a place for a meal and you look at the menu and the veg to non-veg dishes ratio are like 1:10...anyone else have that problem?! But fear not this place shant disappoint on that front.The food is healthy so no need to feel guilty for indulging. You would think with such portion it would take you at least 10 dishes to become satisfied but i was proved wrong! and believe you me this is the only time I am greatful to be proved wrong. I ordered 3 dishes and was relatively stuffed and that saying alot because I love food and I can eat!!The drinks are rather extraordinary from the colours and the taste. This is one place were both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks are enjoyed in the same matter. They are vibrant, thirst clenching and unique...The setting are modern and abstract, the ambiance is relaxed,warm and welcoming. This place is perfect for birthdays, drinks after work, lunch, dinner, social get together, dates, and to simply indulge.need i say more run to your closest one.",

Upon arrival I went to the bar and asked that I seperately order two bottles of expensive champagne and pay for them now in cash so as to keep them off the main bill. I wanted this to be a nice surprise for the birthday girl. They looked at me in a total state of confusion as to why I would want to do this. I eventually paid up and returned to the table. The champagne took 20 mins in getting to us, meanwhile I was trying to put everyone off ordering drinks so as not to spoil the surprise. The drinks eventually arrived and we ordered the food. The waitress was rude and uninterested. It took ages for her to take our ordering slip which we had promptly filled out. We each expected to make 2 or 3 rounds of orders but in the end it took 2 and a half hours for them to serve us just 2 dishes each, we gave up and I asked that the cake be bought out. Someone said they would deal with it. A few minutes later the rude waitress returned and asked loudly right infront of the birthday girl \"should I bring the cake out now?\" it was meant to have been a surprise. 20 mins later and the cake hadn't arrived, I asked her again, but still no cake arrived. Eventually I asked the manager who said he would deal with it which he did. However, as soon as 10 members of our party (including the birthday girl) left for a cigarette, he bought out the cake... To an empty table!! Eventually we complained and only paid a fraction of the bill. But this wasn't the point. It took 3 hours from start to finish and we received very little food. It totally ruined the evening and we were all still so hungry that we ended up getting noodles on the way home. If I could, I would only give one star. Thoroughly disappointed, will never visit again. Also, food that DID arrive was average.",

    "text": "Came here with some friends on a Thursday evening. Very busy with lots of late night shoppers from Oxford Street and the surrounding area. I think I counted three other guys in there, everyone else seemed to be twenty or thirty-something groups of women (can't say that I was complaining!) I'm not a big fan of chains and prefer to support indie restaurants when possible, but sometimes when you're out with people you just want quick and easy 'safe' options. Ping Pong is a very safe choice. Everything is fine at this branch. Drinks are ok. Good taste, but weak measures + too much ice) Dim sum is ok, but a bit bland and pricy for what it is. Service is good, lots of staff, typical of this sort of high-end mainstream type of restaurant (think Strada, Bertorelli etc.) Same goes for the surroundings, clean, well designed, with moody colours and lighting, but a bit soulless. All in all, if you want a safe option, very close to Oxford Street tube, you could do a lot worse than Ping Pong. It's close to a 4 star rating, but expect to feel a bit rushed if they're very busy and they also don't accept American Express, which is pretty poor considering the number of restaurants in their chain + their enormous margins.",

My friends all love Ping Pong, and suggest stopping by whenever we pass the ubiquitous Ping, but after a couple of visits there I am not so sure. So what is my issue?Well, perhaps I'm not sure how I feel about dim sum? I mean, it is a little odd. It comes steaming to the table, and then by the time you have got your chopsticks out, the dumplings have turned cold and gone strangely sticky. The other thing is the cost. On paper it seems inexpensive. \u00a32.99 - \u00a33.99 for three dumplings. But here is the thing; the dumplings are swallowed in a flash, and they recommend ordering at least three portions, so it starts to slowly add up, then there are all the little sides, then the bill is bigger than expected, and I am still hungry!",

Everyone is entitled a bad day right?After hearing so much about this place, I was more than excited to experience London's little dumplings, was super ecstatic, but.....boy was I let down.Their menu was impressive, so many selections and options for vegetarians - so I went crazy and ordered just about one of everything. When the food arrived, it arrived in cute little packaging, so \"yay\" for packaging...but once the food arrived in my mouth, it was not a party.Okay, they weren't absolutely terrible, but a couple of the dumplings I had didn't belong in my mouth. I ordered: green chive dumplingscoriander dumplingsseafood dumplingcrunchy golden vegetable dumplingfluffy white vegetable bunsfresh veges in the sticky rice lotus leafand a couple other things that I can't remember....I remember spitting out some of the dumplings and the foods wrapped in leaves. The buns weren't nice, kinda dry and tasteless. I don't know about this though, its hard not to get dumplings right, next time I'm in town, I'm definitely going back - they must've just had a bad day of cooking, because it wasn't only me who didn't have a pleasant experience. Ping Pong, you're just so cool, I hope my next experience here is a better one. I promise not to get it delivered! My first experience here was....DIM.",

    "text": "Ping Pong dim sum, London's latest all day dim sum haunt. We're great fans of Yauatcha - Alan Yau's (creator of Wagamama) fantastic all day dim sum place and we'd heard that Ping Pong was just as good but cheaper. Well was it? Certainly on entering it looked great. We were taken downstairs and there were a number of huge round tables with a subdued light in the centre. We sat on one of the squarer tables but this had a great view of huge ornamental Japanese style courtyard, with trendy projections playing against and enormous wall. The food and cocktails were certainly cheaper than Yauatcha (not that Yauatcha's expensive) the cocktails were only six or seven pounds each, which was terrific value as they were very long, full of fresh fruit like kumquats, lychees, blueberries and grapes. Mine in particular had tons of fresh mint and was very alcoholic - so much so I managed to knock a third of it over - D'OH! We chose about ten dim sum dishes between the three of us and they averaged at about \u00a33 each. Ping Pong provided a handy menu that we could tick to keep track of our order and make it simpler to give our order to the waiter. Onto the food. If I hadn't already been to Yauatcha's several times, I would have thought the food was brilliant. It was certainly very, very good. Some dishes such as the chive dumplings stood out. The sticky rice in parcels was also tasty. The puffy buns were light and filling at the same time. The chilli sauce that was served with most dishes blew my head off - so handle with care. My friend had an amazing jasmine tea to finish - boiling water poured onto the head of jasmine flower. It looked like something out of Alien as it grew tendrils in the heat and eventually a white flower wound its way through the water looking like a sea anenome. Like all of the new dim sum places in London the toilets were highly trendy too. Black granite everywhere and sensitive taps which turn on as if by magic.",

I would definitely recommend going on a Sunday when their lazy sumday offer is on: \u00a321.50 all you can eat (excluding a couple of areas of the menu). As ping pong is a dim sum restaurant, this offer definitely pays off, especially when in a group as you can all sample a large amount of dishes for far cheaper than you could ordinarily. The cocktail (though excluded from the lazy sumday offer) are absolutely delicious as are the non alcoholic drinks. I would definitely recommend the Hong Kong Colada as well as the Passionfruit lemonade.As far as food goes the dim sum is expertly made and really delicious. If you are unsure of what to order, go for anything in the Ping Pong selection but, as I said, I would recommend going on a sunday so you can experience many different types of dumpling. Definitely recommend this spot for dinner/drinks in the city.",

The service was spot on, the staff were friendly and welcoming, the restaurant has a great feel to it with gorgeous interior decorating and warm lighting. After viewing the menu for a second time I was so excited about ordering food. We decided to go with the set menu, extremely cheap for central London and looked amazing. I think we paid \u00a315 for a 3 servings including dumplings. When the food came out it looked great but was cold and unfortunately not all that tasty. Rice dishes weren't fresh, dumplings slightly over done. I would give this restaurant a second shot but I wouldn't go for the set menu. They also have gluten free options available which is great!!",

    "text": "Not your traditional dim sum! All the classic dishes are on the menu - but with little twists, like using fragrant jasmine rice instead of glutinuous sticky rice, and prawn toast using french garlic baguette instead of normal toast. The menu is extensive and all the food, especially the seafood ones, were bursting with flavour and extremely fresh. You must try some of their more unusual dumplings - the seabass dumpling is a delight to the eyes, with a dunpling skin dyed purple using red cabbage juice. What sets Ping Pong apart from other dim sum restaurants in London is that its not a boring and stiff place - there's a lounge area, and their cocktail menu is quite extensive. You would go to Royal China for example if you had a business meal or a proper Sunday brunch with family. But you go to Ping Pong for a fun night out with friends. Pricewise, its more expensive than your usual dim sum in Chinatown, and probably the same price as other great dim sum places like Pearl Liang and Royal China.

They have round tables which is always a \u00a0good idea if you are going as a group. The ordering style is new as well..As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, they give you a small list of the dishes from which you tick off what you want. Surprisingly this list isn't taken by the waiter, instead they write down the order anyway... Unfortunately, I am a big fan of an un-dim-sum-like dish here- the honey pork ribs.",

    "text": "I have to say, I've been to this PingPong and the one in Hampstead for at least 7 or 8 times and I keep on coming back...yet still I only give this place a three-star rating - why is that?Well, the dim sum is actually pretty decent here, the selection is definitely very innovative and the food quality is always very high. In fact, I often come here with a Chinese friend who agrees with all of the above.So, what is it that I don't like? Well, it comes down to the interior design and the customer service, which this place is kind of lacking. Inter-design-wise, I am sure that lots of people would disagree with me, but for me this is too slick, too stylish and too wanna-be funky. As for the customer service, the people here seem to be lacking a great deal of motivation - no smile, no sign of personal acknowledgement whatsoever...and this just doesn't go well with me.Plus, it's also not a cheap meal, unless you come on a Sunday, when you can do Lazy Sum Day, which is an all-you-can-eat-kind-of-deal for GBP 18.99...still not cheap though.What this place is lacking is the authentic Chinese experience of push cards being rolled around in the restaurant, the steam baskets piling up in the trolleys and also the fact that you can order in a more leisurely style. Along the lines of: I still could eat one more, let's see what the next lady is having in her trolley...Well, if you want this experience in London, I suggest you go to New World in Chinatown...",

Everything came out relatively quickly, but the portion that came out was a little small.

We were both shocked at how much food we got and even though service was mediocre and my wine glass came out a little dirty.. I'm not mad about it. We had a good time and the seating at the bar looking down was pretty cool. Wouldn't be opposed to coming again if I was in the area!

Ping Pong offers this non - territorial atmosphere where you can order a lychee martini or mojitos and have it with your dim sum. It's a great hang out place for 3+ people so everyone can have a sharing + fun experience. It's a great place to take your non-chinese friends for their first dim sum experience. Fantastic!",

It's not the place!Speaking about the food, the quality of it is really high: dim sum are great, with several different fillings and everyone with its characteristic taste and smell, delicious! strongly suggested the black ones (called black prawn dumplings), with squid ink pastry, and the chicken shu mai, chicken and asparagus in a top opened dumpling. But, just take some of them, portions are not that big (from 2 to 4 dumplings each) and it's just so good to share everything with your table!Don't forget to have a cocktail or something to drink, this place has a lot of different options you rarely see and their presentation is always special (as example, take the hybiscus spritz: awesome!)I still have to try the upper floor, with tables surrounding the kitchen, but I can't say anything bad about this place, this is just great! ah and it's not that expensive!",

I have probably eaten here ... conservatively ... 20 times. And if you add up the other Ping Pong locations I've been to, it's easily over 30. I love it. This one has decent ambiance - better than the other ones I've been to. Here's what's good:Har gow - can't go wrong with this classic (again, says the white guy who has no business calling anything a classic)Steamed dumplings: spicy chicken, spicy vegetable, chicken and cashew nut oh good lord it is my absolute favorite thing thereLemongrass Jasmine iced tea - get it everytime!Here's what's not good: leaving this place, not eating at this place, and anyone who reviews it less than four stars. Eff you.Lastly, everything comes really quickly. You can't go wrong here. Really! If they were franchising in the US, I would sink some cash into one. And eat myself out of business.",

You forget to be in London after the first bite. I forgot the dishes's name I will write down today. I can't wait to be there for breath again the same scent. Service was quick and very polite. Our waiter Vinh has been so kind, as our first time in ping pong he explained us everything about menu and dishes. Supervisor and manager were on the floor to check if was everything ok, and at all time you had chance to call someone that help you. The best ravioli and Chinese style dishes in London that I tried so far. I'll write another review about my all you can eat experience in ping pong really soon.",

    "text": "As restaurant chains go Ping Pong has to be one of the better ones. \u00a0I have been to a few of them over the years and they always serve delicious tasty food.Ping Pong Soho is no different. \u00a0When I ate here recently it was full of people happily indulging in their favourite dim sum dishes and guzzling Ping Pong's fantastically exotic cocktails.This is a particularly good venue for big groups and looking around this time I could see that most of the tables were filled with large groups of people. \u00a0The only small issue I had this time was my group of 16 were seated on two separate tables.The food here is really delicious. \u00a0For those of you not familiar with the concept it is mainly Dim Sum, small bite sized portions of food which are traditionally served in small steamer baskets. \u00a0They can be steamed, fried or baked. \u00a0In addition to the dim sum they also serve a number of rice dishes such as Honey-Chilli Chicken Rice Pot or Vegetable Sticky Fried Rice and some small plates such as Honey Glazed Spare Ribs and Chilli Squid.For those of you a bit unsure of what to order there are set menus which will give you \u00a0a decent variety dishes to try and this is particularly good if you are ordering for groups.If however you do fancy ordering for yourself then I can heartily recommend the aforementioned ribs, the Potato and Edamame Cakes, The Crispy Prawn Ball and to start the Garlic and Black Pepper Prawn Crackers. \u00a0Just don't go mad. \u00a0The food is a lot more filling than it looks and you can always order more later. The big selling point for me though has to be the cocktails. \u00a0They put a big twist on your common or garden variety cocktail. \u00a0With names like Hong Kong Colada, Wasabi and Amaretto Sour and Smoked Nashi Negroni \u00a0they are sure to be a conversation starter and the best bit is they taste as good as they sound. \u00a0For those of you not so keen on alcohol they have \u00a0a good choice of mocktails and lemonades, and for those of you who want something simpler they have a good selection of beers, ciders and wines and a huge selection of teas.And the best bit of all is the bill at the end of the night will not break the bank!",

Crispy prawn balls which had a nice crunch and another great sauce paired with it. \u00a0Next up was the firecracker chicken roll which packed some awesome heat, not too much but just right for our palates. \u00a0Traditional xiaolongbao was next and there were delicious; seasoned just right and I wish I ordered a second order. \u00a0Lastly we had one of the specials which was Crispy duck bao... oh my word!!! \u00a0This was the absolute best! \u00a0The buns were soft and fluffy, the duck had a nice crunch to the skin and seasoned perfectly and the plum sauce accentuated everything just right.The service was exceptional and the food was amazing. \u00a0This is a must try for any dim sum fan or someone who wants to give some delicious food a go. \u00a0Cheers!!!",

Even though I was a bit reluctant to have dim sum for dinner, but it wasn't the end of the world.Since we were a large group, we had to pre-order our set dinner (veg and non veg options). \u00a0We sat down in 3 different round tables (the good thing about round tables was everyone could talk to everyone).The waiters and manager had to keep coming back and forth to check what we ordered/our orders. Seemed to have some misunderstanding and was a bit confusing. We had a basket of steamed dumplings for each of us. It was cute, I loved it. The dumplings had different coloured skins, however, the fillings were pretty much the same (was it because I had the veggie version?). When they served the fried potato cakes to our table, the waiter couldn't tell if they were for vegetarian only or for everyone, it was a slight confusing moment. At the end we worked out everyone was having the same.Overall, the food were edible. I never been to PP before and l won't go back (for dim sum) again. I knew it wouldn't be THE place for dim sum anyway.",

I found most of their dimsums acceptable but not the most flavourful. For instance, the soup within xiaolongbao should have been served much warmer, succulent and tasteful. Nonetheless, most everything got the job done, so I would give the place three stars. Service was generally good. Whilst there was a slight glitch with our reservation, they were prompt in finding us a table for six. Throughout the meal, they served most everything on time. However, the bill they calculated turned out to be wrong on many items, so we had to manually check them and get them to correct for us. Ambience was modern and spacious. Not your average Chinatown dimsum place and good for reasonably stylish gatherings.",

I booked a table for 3 on a Weds eve and we were given one of the solo tables rather than being along the shared bar which was great as it's much easier to talk when facing each other!Unfortunately it all went a bit downhill from there as the service was inexcusably bad. We had around 45 minutes of happy hour left when we arrived so were pretty confident we could fit 2 drinks into that time, I ended up chasing the waitress down in order to get our second drinks ticket in on time. We also had to wait around 20 minutes for them to pick up our order sheet, despite the fact that we filled it in straight after ordering our first drinks. The biggest bug bear was after our food arrived my friend asked for a fork as she can't use chopsticks, and after at least a 10 minute wait sitting with our food going cold she had to go and ask a second waitress to be provided with one.I've given 3* rather than 2 as the food \u00a0and drinks were good and reasonable for the price we paid. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is buzzing, but on this occasion the service could have been a lot better.",

So we were a little disappointed. But the food was amazing nonetheless. I'm glad we didn't walk out. We ordered 2 different chicken dumplings (chicken with cashews and spicy chicken with vegetables) and both of them were so fresh and flavorful. They were surprisingly out of vegetable rice so we opted for plain sticky rice and it was good and fresh. Their chicken skewers (3) were delicious and well portioned. Lastly, since their pan fried noodles advertised outside but only served for lunch were not available, we chose a vegetable dumpling and noodle soup and it was still hot when we got to the hotel and was packed full of goodies. We were very happy with everything we ordered and hope next time we can try the items they didn't have available. It was busy the entire time we waited for our order and every wait staff we encountered were very pleasant and kind. The place had a great vibe!",

    "text": "I do find it amazing how rare it is to find a restaurant that offers dim sum after the 5pm cut off point. Although not your typical china town establishment, Ping Pong has obviously honed in on this little niche market and has done quite well in delivering food quality wise and has even produced dumplings which have been experimented on Heston style. We are talking art form here and everything in this restaurant is very classy, very modern, very artsy. One place you definitely need to pay a visit to are the toilets (not for that reason!!) which is situated down a dimly lit corridor (which is my excuse as I accidentally walked into a room with funny wall sinks...) and which are accessible by swiping a hand over a motion sensor panel. The decor is very upscale market and although the food is quite expensive individually, it does work out better value when opting for the set menus which offers several dishes and which does fill you up! In the event of you not being full, and wanting to try more or as much of the dishes as possible, then please do visit Sunday's special buffet, neatly labelled lazy sumdays ;-) for under a fixed price of \u00a325 you are treated to a wide range of dishes which you can easily get carried away with. In terms of drinks, try the teas, as healthy as they are, it's also very fragrant and they come prepared with a 'tea bag' propped open with the tea contents shown.",

You almost feel as if you're in a fish tank looking out! There's a lot of natural light for an underground floor. The wait staff are very polite and gave us a complimentary bottle of beer as it was a birthday in our group which was a nice touch. On to the food...considering dumplings aren't really a speciality dish in their native country, Ping Pong manages to make the dish very appealing both to the eye and the palate. The selection is huge - seafood, chicken, beef, pork and lots more. Our favourite was the Shanghai Xiaolongbao. It's necessary to get the dipping sauces to add extra flavour to the dimsum. Another top dish was the broccoli with the mustard dipping sauce. Then it's also worth trying the duck spring rolls with black sauce. The portion size of the seaweed and prawn crackers was slightly small however they are of a higher quality than you'd typically find at a Soho Chinese restaurant so not too big a complain there. Huge recommendation whether a small family group or a large gathering of friends.",

It's easy to order from the list they give you and you just tick off what you want. The waiter was also helpful in suggesting how much to order. We order about 8 dishes (they suggest 4-5 per person) and shared them and it was exactly enough. My favourite was the prawn balls and the chilli squid! Soooooo tasty! I also had a glass of fresh lemonade which was really lovely and refreshing! I would definitely return here again!!",

    "text": "I was invited out to lunch by a friend and we decided to go to Ping Pong; I had heard about them and she had already been. I love dim sum and wasn't too disappointed; it isn't the BEST in London, but it's tasty enough, the price is right and it's served on a decent environment with good atmosphere and sleek, modern decor (typical dim sum places can be noisy, too brightly lit, uncomfortable and that clich\u00e9 \"chinese takeaway joint\" \u00a0decor can put one off).You are given a menu and a list where you tick your selected dishes - quite fun and makes ordering easy. Each portion comes with around three pieces and most are under \u00a34. The baskets come to the table all at once and will be stacked high if you order a lot; tables are on the small side, so it can become a bit awkward juggling all that stuff. But you'll manage. :) It is the right thing to do here, though; the portions aren't huge (they shouldn't be; it's dim sum after all) and it would be very time consuming to keep refilling your table everytime you finished a basket, increasing waiting times. \u00a0If you're not too ravenous you could order two or three + a small main meal (one of the rice dishes, maybe). If you're really ravenous, well, you're going to spend a little more or go elsewhere. If you're going for the set menus they are good value, but remember you'll get mostly individual pieces instead of a portion of three as in the a la carte.Almost everything I ordered was tasty, especially the honeyed chilli chicken and mushroom rice pot (not a big portion, but it's only over \u00a36 so I certainly wasn't expecting a bucket). The char sui buns (steamed bun with BBQ pork) are ok; I've certainly had better, but also much worse. Loved my drink called Hibiscus Spritz; you are given a glass of fizz with a flower inside an ice cube in which you pour a concoction of liqueurs; very \"chemistry class\" and deliciously refreshing. Didn't have time for more cocktails and dessert, but will do next time - the drinks menu look particularly appealing and I really liked the one I tried.Apparently they are always changing the menus with the seasons. A good trick to get you coming back, and I intend to. :)",

Baked chicken puffs, seafood or chive dumplings, Jasmine chicken spring rolls and crispy prawn balls headline the growing list of favourites. Not to mention the beautiful flowering Jasmine teas. Portions are served in pieces of 3 - perfect if you visit with a couple of friends and take a culinary tour of the unlimited Sunday menu. Arrive in a small party, and you may find yourself sharing a table downstairs - as is the norm, but here is where the similarities to some of China-Town's old-school haunts end. The decor is all chocolate modernism with a minimalist kick. Even a visit to the loo is all theatre here! My one gripe then - and this has yet to spoil the day - is that the friendly staff are only somewhat attentive, being as at some point during service we felt forgotten - on both visits. That said, we will be returning for what feels like a lot of luxury for only a little bit of dosh in a truly lovely setting. Little steamed parcels of deliciousness indeed!",
