A relatively low-key glass entrance you go downstairs to the reception where you start off the evening with some drinks at what feels like a high end bar/drinking area. \u00a39 for a G&T, about right for this sort of establishment. Down a central staircase that makes you feel like you're on the Titanic and it opens up to a vast eating area, one of the largest in London. The food is exceptional, foi gras and sea bass, with a chocolate brownie washed down with Chablis. High quality food, good atmosphere for a Thursday and not over the top expensive. One of my favourites, would recommend to anyone.",

Which is why we signed up for Quaglino's Cocktail Club (\u00a320 including two complimentary cocktails), where you can learn cocktail knowledge from mixologist Branislav Ivanic.The talented Ivanic introduced our group to the basic bar tending tools before distributing some fresh, quality ingredients (the core of any stellar cocktail) and demonstrating a number of special, summery tipples. Then it was our turn to be let loose behind the bar. With Ivanic's help, I learnt how to make a mean vodka martini and bloody mary, although my bottle juggling stunts left a lot to be desired. Tom Cruise in Cocktail, I am not.Still at the end of the 90 minute session, I was well on my way to becoming a cocktail connoisseur. Whether I will be able to remember the recipes for my next soiree is another matter: expect to have poured plenty of booze down your throat by the time the night is through.To make a booking, call Georgia on 020 7484 2005",

The venue itself is rather stunning to look at and makes clever use of light to make you forget the fact that you are dining underground. The bar is typically elegant for this part of town - plus you get a great view of the rest of the people dining in the restaurant below you. The food was very good, but portions were on the small size for the one guy in our group. I had the pea soup and gilt head bream, both of which were tasty and filling. The star of the show, however, was the Eton Mess for dessert which was utterly divine and tasted ridiculously indulgent. As it was my friend's birthday we had brought him a cake - we were then a bit horrified to discover that Quaglino's charges a 'cakage' fee of \u00a32.50 per slice! What the -?! I have never come across such a ridiculous policy in my life. Apparently it is because they can provide their own cakes in such cases. Still, the staff were polite enough to put our cake on a plate and bring it over with some candles. We then celebrated and had it put back in its box to avoid the afore-mentioned cake tax. Overall, Quaglino's was a lovely venue for a meal with friends - the staff were charming and attentive and the venue had a great buzz about it. Just a pity about the silly cake policy!",

There seems to be a lunch offer on at the moment - hunt one of these down. A fairly small glass of (very good) wine at \u00a35.30 ups the price, and there are dozens of other places to go in London where food is better, cheaper, and the atmosphere a bit more upbeat; the place was maybe 1/3 full at lunchtime yesterday, which is probably right for the third week in Jan (and pre pay-day) but in a space as large as Quaglinos, it felt a little deserted. One thing that is worth noting though is that they don't charge extra for room hire - you can use their decent private room if you've a certain number, and it won't cost you more.",

As a table of 20-somethings if felt as though the waiting staff viewed us as young and uneducated so were slightly patronising. We had an older party next to us who kept jamming their chairs back into our table and complaining very loudly about how much space we were taking up.

They were kind enough to accommodate us even though we were late for our reservation. The wait staff are incredibly friendly and go above and beyond to make your experience special. Our server offered us the menus and told us we will be getting drinks with our \u00a0meals; but my husband politely declined as we don't drink. The server was so kind and offered us so many different mocktail options and even went out of his way to make them for us at the bar! The food was incredible! We did the 3-course dinner meal and were so pleased with the choices we made. Around 9pm a live band played and we were not rushed out even though we had finished dinner. We sat and enjoined the music and atmosphere for a while. I would def say this beautiful restaurant will be getting on my top 5 places and I can't wait to go back!",

The dining room which was then bright white has turned into Bordello Fabulous focusing on great music, shadows and vivid back lighting. I am quite sure that this is a great place to party even after decades of it being opened. A few pics , alas as tourist we dined too early to partake of the later activities.",

They were kind enough to give me a birthday dessert and wish me well but I then consumed a chocolate fondant + vanilla ice cream! \u00a0I couldn't have imagined a better meal or warmer waitstaff. We moved to a table at the bar for the rest of the evening and had more wine, lots of well made old fashioneds, and plenty fun. The jazz band was incredible and the ladies who sang afterward were phenomenal. I couldn't have been more pleased. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended for special occasions or fancy nights out.",

Perfection.We headed to their new Gin Joint and had a few cocktails to get the night started. We were serenaded by a beautiful singer who sang like a Gah damn angel! Though two of the cocktails were lacking in depth & dimension \u00a0there was one we all adored. A few cocktails later we were seated for dinner and boy that was top notch service.. Our napkins were placed on our laps for us by a handsome and well trained waiter, then we were given a choice of rich wines to choose from. The food? Bloody hell it was devine! Everything we had was simply gorgeous!Refined and classically beautiful in every way. We tucked into our meals whilst enjoying more live 1920's style entertainment. The dancers and singers were lovely and we enjoyed the show tremendously. I felt like I was back in Paris at the Moulin rouge.They never left our glasses empty which was also lovely. Its like they knew just when you wanted more and when you didn't.The banana parfait is to dieeeeee for .... I mean everything we had was ... Defo one of my fav spots now!Oh and before I forget they have someone who opens the doors for you to enter the ladies ... Ahhhhh perfection",

The drinks are always good here & give a nice buzz. The music was happening too, so we grooved for a good while here.There are two distinct areas to Quaglino's the upstairs bar/lounge and the downstairs main restaurant. Both glam but I actually prefer the bar area.Make a reservation, this isn't your local pub that you can just fall into. They often have a musical act featured or something happening in there that will surely make you smile.Top marks!",

The fish was amazing and the potatoes prepared perfectly, moist and sweet. \u00a0 My friend had the Rib Eye with potato puree. \u00a0He said the steak was adequate and we both agreed the potato was bland. \u00a0So much so I doubt it had even been seasoned. \u00a0Neither of us were inspired by the desert menu.Here's the thing, I do really like Quaglino's. \u00a0I can imagine it's a great venue for a large party. \u00a0But, it's not of the standard for the prices on it;s menu. \u00a0So, in the words of so many school teachers, it \"must try harder\" .",

    "text": "The partner in crime and I were invited to try the new 1929 Menu at Quaglino's and we were certainly spoiled rotten!The Hutch Club 1929 menu, which includes six West Mersea Rock Oysters and a glass of champagne to commemorate when Quaglino's first opened its doors to a beautiful, decadent society crowd in 1929.This July, they are hiding a South Sea Ronirose pearl worth \u00a32,000 in an oyster for one lucky diner to find. This takes inspiration from Barbara Cartland, who once found a pearl in her oyster while dining in the 1930s!! \u00a0How lucky was she?!Sadly we didn't find the pearl but the food was out of this world, and certainly made up for it!The six oysters were served with shallot vinegar that was divine, and being my first oyster experience I was a little nervous! \u00a0After the first mouthful the nerves were gone, and I soon devoured all the oysters! \u00a0My partner in crime was practically licking the shells clean he liked them so much!Second course was the Hutch Crab & Lobster Burger, which I would put in my top 3 burgers of all time! \u00a0I have never tried Lobster either, and I enjoyed this so much! \u00a0The chips were perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing.I will certainly be returning with my parents who are serious seafood lovers! \u00a0What a great meal we had!",
