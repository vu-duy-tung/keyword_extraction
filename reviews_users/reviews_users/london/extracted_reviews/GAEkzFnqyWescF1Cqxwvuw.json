    "text": "Hmmm the jury is still out in my mind for this place yet. This newly renovated pub has I've heard been a local favourite for years previously attracting the in crowd of the area as well as the odd celeb.Newly refurbished I've tried this place a couple of times. It positions itself (according to its website) as being reminiscent of 'a hedonistic french chateau' errrr ok, if that is what you like while then fair play, but is it me or does some of the interior look a tiny bit - dare I say it - cheap? A little bit like that DIY ragwork so popular years ago when your mum covered every wooden surface in a creamy green paint with rags? The bar looks a little sparse? The ridiculously huge statue in the bar a bit like they are trying a tad too hard? Other areas of the bar are really nice, the little snug room off of the main bar seems a nice plittle place to curl up on a Sunday afternoon with a pint and a paper. If you can get a pint that is, last time I went in the confused and befuddled bar man had to explain that there was a problem and only over priced bottled beer was available. Still, these things can happen, and the reason I haven't completely dismissed this place is the fact that they seem to have a good line up of events taking shape, with parties over the summer with the most recent having a line up that includes a DJ set from the New Young Pony Club, burlesque performers and live music, it seems that they are cashing in with the vibe of london at the moment so I await with interest whether it all works out.",

The staff are friendly and there is also a very nice restaurant out the back. There are lots of hidden rooms and corners which makes this the perfect place to escape. Some excellent music events too, especially on Friday nights. Nice roof terrace for the smokers and interesting artifacts dotted about make this an excellent choice for a local night out.",

Firstly, there's a main pub/restaurant area, a side room in the style of a manor house library plus a number of function rooms upstairs including outside space. The vibe is young, fresh and expensive although the crowd is a mix of Ladbroke Grove and Kilburn locals and young professionals. The mix seems to work, as is the case with a lot of pubs in West London. Definitely worth checking out, especially for a private party or birthday.",

The buzz is electric and there is a natural sense of of classy togetherness which stems from the professional newcomers as well as the intergrated locals . This is something you would expect from a West London bar in the cosmopolitan Notting Hill but Paradise is not in Notting Hill and this only goes towards complementing the whole vibe and aura . The Paradise is beautifully set and has two floors which both contain outside garden areas . The people are beautifull and the drinks are very reasonable priced . See you again Saturday !!! Why live in the hell of recession , credit crunch . when you could be in PARADISE ??",

Sadly I had the same experience as contessa1 (see above). i had booked a table a few days in advance for sunday lunch, however my booking could not be located. the staff did not apologise and although we were the first people in the restaurant we were made to wait for ages before being served. the food was ok,normal gastropub grub. on a positive note, some of the rooms can be hired, the front 'reading room' looks exceptionally inviting. i think this place has a very different vibe on weeknights and weekends. so prepared to be pleasantly surprised or in our case disappointed. personally i think it is not worth the hype. there are a few gastropubs up the road (chamberlayne road) where the service and the food is a lot better.",

So I trawled about until I could match up a 50% offer with a seemingly credible place serving grouse. Paradise by way of Kensal Green. In my case, this was by way of a bike ride from Kings Cross, past what seemed like three wrecks and five arrests. A cheerful neighborhood. But the place is nice, in a weird sort of high school La boh\u00e8me production sort of way. Certainly if your fetish includes birdcages Paradise will prove stimulating. The description of the grouse made me nervous. Cabbage and chocolate/raspberry sauce? But it worked extremely well and the sauce wasn't at all the sort of sickly sweet sludge I was dreading. I would have preferred the entire carcass but serving off the bone certainly made for easier eating. An herb-heavy bunny terrine was credible but puddings were lackluster and the bread was subpar. Service - competent and helpful but a bit on the confused side.",

    "text": "Quirky decor, decent food, reasonable priced drinks, a bit isolatedI've been wanting to go to Paradise ever since I read the poem \"The Rolling English Road\" (en.wikisource.org/wiki/T\u2026). When one of my friends suggested it for her birthday dinner, I eagerly jumped on the bandwagon and come Saturday night I dragged my hungover self all the way to Kensal Green (Bakerloo line...I had to look it up as I've never heard fo the station before...it's actually still considered Zone 2!).I had a little trouble finding the place despite it's size and location on the main road. The exterior is a dull gray with little lighting which allows it to blend in with the surroundings, especially at night. Once you get inside however, the vibe changes completely with the first bar being quite lively with a range of patrons, but typically youngish (20s to mid 30s). The restaurant is cosy without being crowded although the staff were happy to let me wander around looking confused for a while before asking if they could help me.The house wines were adequate and affordably priced. I was a bit disappointed in the food as I had heard great things about this gastropub. I ordered the gnocchi with taligello cheese which at first bite was delicious if slightly too chewy but quickly being overwhelmingly rich. the light smattering of sauce helped cut through the thick flavour and texture of the gnocchi but was gone all too soon. My other gripe was the size of the plates relative to the food provided. The portions were sufficient but bordered on the minimalist side but the plates were easily large enough to each hold a feast for kings. Given our table had a couple more people crowded on, it was a challenge to find enough real estate to put the plates down. The sticky toffee pudding for dessert was also a bit small, but beautifully presented to the extent that you almost didn't want to eat it to preserve the effect.Afterwards, we headed upstairs to the main bar and had a couple rounds of shots (you can get 6 shots of vodka/tequila/sambuca for \u00a315). The upstairs is oddly decorated with a red lightbulb cross adorning one wall which doesn't really match the rest of the area but was intriguing. The bar staff are quick and efficient and the music was suitable for casual dancing.Overall, I would go back but most likely for dinner as opposed to the start of a night out as the location means it takes forever to get back to central london.",

When I was a kid (not so long ago) I would have been scared to even venture down that way. So I guess this a result of gentrification, which I suppose is a good thing, but the bar knows this, and have one of those absolute rule policies. But I suppose everywhere needs a place like this, you know the kind of place that makes you feel that you shouldn't touch anything because it has been intentionally been made to look really oldEvery time I come down I enter with resentful jealousy and leave with glee and a free cab, and always surprised with the room upstairs. love it really, but a pain of a walk home.

The decor is the ultimate in kitsch - think lots of antique furniture, cool floral prints, sofas, mirrors, funky lights and lamps. It almost like your 'home from home' which is probably why it is so popular and attracts a host of dedicated locals.The pub is huge - lots of different rooms on a couple of levels which are used for music nights, screenings and general private events. The main bar area has a really cool atmosphere and I have heard that Kate Moss comes here occasionally.It has a lovely 'local' feel but is always busy with a mixed crowd of young and old. Also, if you're into your fashion, you will always find someone like-minded here! It is a shame I don't live nearer as I would definitely visit on a much more frequent basis.

I would give the food 3 stars and the drinks 2 a star rating. \u00a0The special \"elderberry martini\", highly recommended by the waitress, was pink and very sweet. \u00a0She forgot our wine order until the end of the meal when we really didn't want it any more. \u00a0But the food was good. \u00a0We had oysters to start - cleaned properly, an oyster essential - and the rabbit terrine, which was smooth and rich. The mains were good, although not especially memorable. \u00a0Still, next time someone proposes a night out at Paradise, I will be sorely tempted to book a table in the dining room beforehand, even just for appetizers so that we can avoid the annoying lines (both inside and out).",

They had a live band playing this nasty heavy metal, yuk. The music policy changes, so maybe I was just unlucky to have those mad so called musicians on stage. They also had a belly dancer who was dancing to the rhythm of drums while balancing a huge sword on top of her head. A truly thriller night.",

    "text": "Hmm, where to start? Paradise pub by way of Kensal Green features an array of fine things. Decor is right up there with the best of pub/clubs. I never really go for these, as they are either too clubby or too pubby, but Paradise achieves a utopian equilibrium. Two striking features of the venue: 1.) The central stair case. It is old, it has paint peeling off the banister, but it's the centre point. Everyone streams through this narrow canal of wood and you never know who you might run into. 2.) The balcony. Just when things are getting too hot or too heavy, step outside with the smokers and take in some fresh air. I debated about the utter lameness of Silvio Berlusconi with an Italian politics student on this chilly moon spot. Music was solely house. That wasn't too much of a problem at first, as it was well-chosen and flowed. So as a lubricant for the party it worked. Could have used some variety though. That said I saw posters for some great theme parties at Paradise, including a rockabilly/50s vintage rock night. Think this has already come and gone but its indicative of the things going on there. Nice website as well with a cute G.K. Chesterton quote (and eponymous source of the club's name): For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green. One quibble: there were a couple of drunken rowdy types who threatened to inflict violence upon one another but this was quickly smothered by the good cheer of all those around. I recuse myself from passing judgement on the food as I did not eat. Verdict: will go back - but only on a theme night.",

They have amazing sofas, gorgeous floral lamps (one of which my friend and i were considering trying to pinch!), beautiful tall bookcases, old vintage mirrors (again, many of them would look great in my bedroom!) and many more gorgeous interior touches. Their interior designer needs a pay rise as it fits the building perfectly. I love the numerous rooms which are perfect to chat with friends in. During the Portobello Film festival they had a few nights of film showings in one of their upstairs rooms which was great to be part of. There is a real sense of community here and it attracts a great mix of young and old.",

We had such a nice evening dining. The food came at a nice reasonable pace, the food was delicious and the staff were very welcoming and delightful.To start, the menu wasn't too much, just the right selection with a nice range. The chorizo and prawn starter was flavoursome and a taste of the tuna was also soft and well presented.My main was lamb and it just fell apart, nicely cooked and well seasoned and portioned well. My wife and mother-in-law had the fish which also was cooked just right.The restaurant itself has a cozy atmosphere with an old fashioned decor that'll keep you looking around!We'd also found an amazing deal online which I'd suggest doing some research on as it came to a very reasonable price for all 3. The bar is also a great area to chill before or after your delightful evening, I'd also recommend having a look at the cocktail list!In all, last night was a delight and wouldn't mind coming back soon!",

I though had mine plain as I don't like cheese etc in my burger but my friend does and my it was oozing with cheese and all sorts of veg looked amazing. If I am in the area next time I will definitely try out their restaurant area. After we had finished are burger we headed to the stairs to go up as that is where the event takes place. \u00a0We was handed a envelope with a mask to wear, pen, suspect page and not page. \u00a0We was led up the stairs by a boy and girl (well two adults pretending to be children) and then we entered a room where there was some performing half naked sexy dancing ladies who were part of the whole act / story. \u00a0I cant say much about the story as don't want to give anything away but basically there is affairs going on between the whole group of woman and their boyfriends so many arguments happen but the best part was that the dancing that the ladies and men done throughout the show there was about 6 different dances throughout the night. \u00a0The boy and girl guides you to important pieces of info throughout the night and also whilst going around listening and watching the acting taking place you have to be quite which is good as does not spoil what is going on and can take in more what is going on. \u00a0Also the difference with this murder mystery is that you had to solve who was going to be murdered and who was the killer so unique in that respect. \u00a0I got the killer right and my friend got who would be murdered correctly. \u00a0However even though we got them right we did not get a price just a slip of paper with a saying on it so that was a tad disappointing and also we could not even keep the masks which i think is quite unhygienic to give back for them to reuse again and its not even like the masks were expensive they were cheap. \u00a0 However well worth the money as the acting by all was superb and a great plot the best murder mystery I have ever done. \u00a0So don't miss out and book your murder mystery now via Y Plan.",

It's not sure what its trying to be, but luckily it gets mighty dark in there so as soon as the lights go down, it'll feel like any hipster joint. The crowd changes week on week, but its always buzzing and there's always some event going on.It's pricey, but you're not over blessed for choices in w10, so my advice is head for Portobello Road or head for The Paradise.",

There are multiple levels and a dining area and a cool little library looking private room for parties. A few different outdoor garden areas, generally taken over by the smokers during winter time.It's great because it's close, I could technically bike all the way there or at least walk a while then catch a bus the rest of the way. I've been to a reggae event upstairs and also a lazy sunday afternoon. Both times relatively packed but still managed to find our own space.I just feel awkward here. Like Im not trendy enough or local enough to be here. Not sure why that is.Meh, check it out if you're in the neighborhood. Or just walk down the alleyway next door to the other pub (they have free popcorn hehe).",

So always fond memories of meeting randoms in one of the many rooms, in the smoking areas or the queue for the toilet. Dance floor was packed but good times. Maybe got a bit overcrowded over the last few years as its popularity spread and people from further afield started coming but you can't blame them for that. Sunday roasts are damn \u00a0good too.",

Great ambience/decor for a drink, but avoid eating the food is overpriced and not worth it. It used to be good , maybe the chef has changed.",

    "text": "You wouldn't expect to find this place in this area but its a pleasant suprise. The decor is great, it feels like you have walked into some early 1900's house, with private rooms decorated with fires, books and big red leather chairs you would to sink into. We came to the Paradise for dinner, and the dining rooms is decorate with birdcages and candles, and all looks extremely decadent. The food was very good, and isn't afraid to push the boundaries, expect to find foie gras, duck veloute, steak, venison amongst the dishes. With all this in mind our meal was ruined by the dreadful service. I have no idea how our waitress is in customer facing role but i think a career change should be in order. Drinks were slammed on the table, and although we were aware we had a table turnaround of 2 1/2 hours we were constantly rushed to put our orders through. They even made us call our friends who were not there to see what they wanted to order. I would like to return but the poor service really put a dampener on our meal, which is a shame as this place has real potential. Far too pretentious.",
