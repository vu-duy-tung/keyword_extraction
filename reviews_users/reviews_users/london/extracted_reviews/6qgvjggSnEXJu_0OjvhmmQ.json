    "text": "This is a fantastic Persian kabob restaurant. \u00a0Absolutely mouth wateringly delicious in every way possible. \u00a0As an Iranian who has had many a kabobs in her life, Alounak is right on the money when it comes to the taste, flavors, and overall yumminess that is Persian kabob. \u00a0There are several things of note: Alounak, more or less, specializes in a variety of kabobs and not the other Persian \"stews\" (khorshets). \u00a0So, for instance, I wouldn't go to Alounak to get my Khorshet Anar fix. \u00a0However, there are lots of kabobs: koobedeh (ground meat), barg (fillet mignon), jojeh (chicken), and a veggie kabob skewer. \u00a0One can order these kabobs with rice, with bread, and in different combination of \u00a0kabobs. \u00a0 Depending on which combination you order, the price can be as low as \u00a38 to \u00a320. \u00a0Also, the restaurant is on the smaller side which means that depending on the size of the crowd, it can be a wait for a table. \u00a0I imagine it's easier to be seated as a group of, say, 4 or 2 than it is 6. \u00a0Finally, order the bread. \u00a0They make it right there in this cool oven contraption and it is super yummy and warm. \u00a0If you are not a neophyte when it comes to Persian food: the rice was cooked very well and came with the necessary grilled tomato to make the kabob entree complete.In re: previous review below: I never felt rushed by the wait staff. \u00a0I did feel self-imposed rush to leave once done with food as there were about 8 people hovering about waiting to be seated. \u00a0I figured it'd be good karma to roll out when the food was done.",

Our next clue (besides all of the below yelp reviews) was the fact that the place was packed and continued to be so throughout our dinner. No group that showed up refused to wait for a table to open up since turnaround time was so quick and the wait staff was on top of it. The BYOB setup was a nice way to split a bottle of wine and keep the check under \u00a330. Tonight's dinner made us grateful for yelp reviews since we're on our honeymoon and we don't know our way around London at all. This review is our way of giving a little back for steering us in the right direction..",

The service is usually prompt, and in the times I've been there they've never messed up an order.The only drawback is the decor which seems to have been neglected over time.

The place is always full of people, though there are at least two more persian restaurants around and they are generally empty. As a quick tip, koobedeh (with taftoon bread or rice) is the cheapest main course. Yet, the portion is quite enough and quality is stunning.If you're not familiar with the persian starters (mezes), mixed meze plate offers a good option to collect four of the best ones dressed with olives, pickles, etc. It's a pity that bread doesn't come together with the plate, but you can order a taftoon bread and enjoy alltogether.Alcohol is not served, yet it's not due to its Islamic aspect but the licence. You can bring your own wine, or any other alcoholic drink (don't forget to get some glasses as well).",

Thier grilled chicken we tried at that time has the same quality but it is not as good.The restaurant itself is relatively small, but it is bustling with diners most of the time, one other nice touch is the guy who bakes traditional iranian flat bread in an oven so that you will always get some fresh bread.Downfalls are small but in such restaurant, first, thier menu is not very extensive - and who needs it to be if thier foods has such excellency . Secondly, many of the staff are not iranian which is not something you should expect in such a themed restaurant. Prices are very reasonable for this out of the world quality and this is why it is always packed, so to be in the safe side always book as there will no guarentee that you won't end being on the road waiting in a queue if you don't do so.",

This restaurant is always packed and for good reason. for less tan 20 pounds a head, you can eat some pretty good-quality Persian cuisine in a bustly and friendly atmosphere. And further to being a lot cheaper than other restaurants in that area for the food, the restaurant also allows you to bring your own booze! Well. technically you MUST bring your own booze if u wanna drink as they don't serve any :-). The bread is freshly baked in-house and on order so is amazing, as are the meat skewers. I notice some other reviewers saying it is a \"middle-eastern\" place. Technically, yes. But do not go in expecting Lebanese food. Persian cuisine is different. The restaurant's only drawback, aside from the impossibility of booking or getting a table without queuing at peak times, is that the menu is really not the broadest and does not cover the whole of Persian cuisine. But, for the basics, it's there and the place to go in that area!",

    "text": "As a life long Londoner with a Persian mother too, I must say when it comes to Kabob (the Persian kind rather than 'kebab'), Alounak had been on the money for years. Its all about the kabob here. Like another reviewer said, the Koresht is hit and miss but the Koobideh (mince lamb) and Barg (lamb shank) is Spot on everytime! If there's one word that I phrase use to describe their kabobs. It's 'consistently good.' since I've been going there since the mid 90s and never had a bad kabob once. Don't come for the decor. It's very cosy but it's no Shahs Palace.Personally though, the decor is good enough for me, i'm not into opulent bling which typically adorns the walls of Persian restaurants.Do expect to wait in line to get seated in the evening, for about ten to fifteen minutes. It's very popular.For all you Persian/kabob novices, I recommend you ask for Makhsous, since you get the best of both worlds; one Koobideh and one Barg, to try both. the starters are all great, especially the 'Mirza Ghassemi' (egg plant/aubergine, tomato and garlic). Definitely try their freshly oven baked on site 'taftoon' naan with some feta cheese and mint starter.the chicken/joojeh kabob is equally as good, but since i rarely order it and have less places to compare it to, i'll focus on its lamb brethren.A tip for those watching the calories or simply trying to reduce carb intake is to ask for rice (all kabob is served with a large amount of delicious Persian long grain rice) to be 'half rice and half salad shirazi.' you will then be given half the usual amount of rice replaced with a tangy lemon and olive oil drizzled refreshing salad of cucumber, tomato and spring onions.Alounak also does one of the best Doogs (think a salty Indian lassi, yoghurt drink). Very fresh in a jug, not bottled.Last but not least, for visiting American persians, especially those from Los Angeles where there is also a plethora of Persian restaurants, you must try Alounak since in U.K., Persian kebob uses lamb, which I believe is more authentic rather than the Beef which is used in the majority of Persian restaurants across the Atlantic.",

Fresh baked bread from their clay oven. Perfectly seared kabobs. Cute decor. What is not to love? Everything is fresh, portions are generous, and everything I have ordered on the menu has been on point! When I went, it was BYOB. Make sure to get there early or later on in the night - otherwise you will be waiting for hours - really doesn't change depending on weekdays/weekends.",

    "text": "Beautiful/humble little resto with a really yummy menu. I've only been here once - a fact I'd like to change soon. I have no idea how authentically Iranian the food is, but it's very satisfying and flavourful. Lots of stews and grilled meats. Great breads. Gorgeous fresh mint tea too. The dish with the okra (sorry I don't remember the name) was proper good and I'd go back just to have it again. On a busy bit of Westbourne Grove, people watching from Alounak's giant windows is a delight. The staff are lovely too. One waitress went waaaay out of her way to make sure she was able to provide a thorough answer to a question my dining buddy asked. Prices are right considering the location and the quality of food. I guess the only complaint that I might have during a future visit could be that there's a no-rez policy. I got lucky nabbing a table when I dined here. But by 8pm there was a queue out the door - which given it was actually freezing and snowing outside might give good indication of the kinds of crowds this place can attract! FYI: BYOB",

    "text": "I really like Middle-Eastern food because its not so hot or spicy and my most favourite Persian restaurant in town is the Alounak conveniently located in Westbourne Grove. Great meat (all of it is great, chicken or lamb, diced, sliced or minced!). Lovely saffron rice. Again great Naan bread - a must for a Persian restaurant in my view! The best of all is the Mast-o-khiar (like Tzaziki) cucumbers, thick yoghurt, garlic and mint,and the Torshi (pickles). The starters are unusual and delicious, as Persian food tends to focus more on the main course. Also try the herb salad with feta cheese and walnuts (Paneer Sabzi). I am not a great salad fan but the freshness of this was really delightful-nothing like some of the stale unappetising salads you can get in some restaurants. A meal will cost you about 20 and its worth paying but its worth much more . Food never disappointed me, service is great, location is much more accessible and there's plenty to do after dinner in the area. Downside? Always busy and restaurant doesn't accept reservations. Difficult to accommodate big groups but great for a date or a small group 2-6. Sometimes you have to wait outside until a table is free. Also no alcohol served. Also if anyone is interested there's a great book shop nearby next to the Kufa Gallery called Al Saqi which has a variety of Arabic and English books centered around Middle Eastern culture",

The lamb (we tried both minced and marinated varieties) was not especially tasty and could even have been described as tough. It comes with rice and basic salad, nothing that exciting. Nice dips and bread and large portions the only redeeming feature of an otherwise over-hyped, lacklustre meal. A queue for half an hour to sit down and eat (although the food does come out speedily). Our last kebab experience was an Ockbasi place in Hackney and Alounak simply paled in comparison.

Kashke bademjan: mashed fried aubergine (eggplant), fried onions, herbs, garlic, walnuts and kashk (a sort of dairy product made from yogurt). It's a spread/dip served with freshly made flat bread (there is a clay oven in the corner as you walk, makes the fresh flat bread that is served warm and soft, yummy). I felt like I was eating freshly prepared and seasoned baby food, lol. Should've got the hummus. It's not bad, it's just not for everyone. Chelo-kabob chenjeh: a skewer of minced lamb and a skewer of marinated lamb served with grilled tomato and rice. Two of us shared one plate and it was just enough food. The plate is average and nothing to rave about. I like the minced lamb better because the marinade on the other skewer was just ok and the meat just wasn't as tender as I would like it to be. The basmati rice is too plain for my liking (and I like plain/simple stuff). But I've always preferred the more sweet, moist and fragrant taste of jasmine rice. I did enjoy the little bit of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and jalapenos that was on this dish. This place is a good place to go if you need to get full and don't want to spend too much money. Maybe the chicken skewers are better?",

Nice, fitting decor and packed with Persian people, who unlike me, seemed to know what they were doing. Service was good since it's such a small restaurant.I had the saffron marinated chicken dish which came in some tasty kebab-like chunks with salad and (since I had chosen the bread option) all wrapped up inside this giant flatbread. I'm glad I tried the bread since it was baked fresh in a stone oven by the door, but it was a huge and unwieldy and a bit plain with just the chicken. It probably does better with some hummus or toppings. Might return one day to try a lamb dish or one of their intriguing day-of-the-week specials.",

    "text": "Here's to adventurous taste buds and to Yelp! When the place I really wanted to dine was closed, I turned to my trusty iPhone to tell me about the interesting looking place across the street. And so instead of having barbecued American food, I had Middle Eastern. Wha-huh? It's a good thing my stomach just let my brain decide because it was the right choice!A table for one was a long bench along the wall that gave me the opportunity to watch the door and the street, but I also got to see how the taftoon bread is made and prepared. The baker is an artist and he made it look surprisingly simple. It's a naan-like flat bread that is cooked when it's stuck to the inside wall of a clay oven. Very clever!Since I don't know much about Persian food, I just went with a cucumber salad to start and the \"Saturday special\" for main. I was not disappointed. While my order was prepared, I tore pieces of the bread and put a bit of butter on it. When it arrived, the fresh bowl of finely diced cucumber, tomato and onion was fresh and crisp, setting me up for the star of the meal - a big pile of yummy rice and a lamb shank. The phrase \"fell off the bone\" is overused, but in this case it was true. A light push with my fork and the meat just... fell. No knife needed. Moist and yummy, I spooned some of the juices from the bowl on to it just because it was there, even though it really wasn't needed.Before I knew it, the plate was clean, the tummy was full and I was very well satisfied. No need for dessert.Really good food, good service, an excellent value. You won't spend a lot of money here because it's proper Arabic and therefore you will save a ton that you'd otherwise be spending on wine and beer. Nothing wrong with that at all!",

Bread was dry and brittle and we received one order when we ordered two. The 'paneer' starter was three slivers from a block of 50p white farmhouse cheese under a high pile of mint which did not seem washed. The kebab was dry and overdone; the rice was also dry and the tiny bit of grilled tomato nowhere near enough to sauce the plate. Think: everything dry and served with a frown. Dessert--how do you screw up dessert?--tasted indifferent at best. Even the tea was bitter and astringent. What's up Yelpers why did you send us here :/",

We came at a quiet time and was seated immediately.Drinks ordered, we ordered the mixed starter which came with 4 different dips and ordered bread. The starters were super yummy and the bread was made fresh in the little clay oven that you see when entering the restaurant. Although the starter was yummy, I wish I had skipped them and saved room for the mains.For mains we got the Wednesday Special and the Alounak special. The Wednesday special was aubergines and lamb in a special tomato sauce with rice. It reminded me of my grandma's home cooking, it was delicious. The lamb was super tender and just fell apart as you ate it. The Alnounak special came with a lamb shish kebab, chicken shish kebab, and chicken kebab with salad and rice. The meats were nicely seasoned and cooked so they stayed moist.The staff was attentive and the ambiance was really relaxed.Will be back for sure!",

We were greeted with a full house and were asked to go to the waiting room - aka the juice shop next door. A dull boring sad looking place where bad Persian artefacts go to die. Back to the restaurant on hand. The aroma of Middle Eastern food sifted through the air from the kitchen as the busy plates were rushed out to the groups seated table close to table. We opted for the choice of starters and an Alanouk special. I might add my eating companion was Persian so I knew I had someone who had the palate for our feast to come .... And a feast it was !Large portions and big plates = value for money in some peoples world but not mine. The food was hot but lacking pure authenticity. The lamb was dry and the salad looked like it had a life better than the one it was living on my plate. I would recommend this to friends purely based on the portion size but not much else.",

I even brought my mom to this joint, and she gave it two thumbs up - you don't get better recommendation than that.If it's your first time, go for sultani for main course you'll get a taste of everything. If you're not that much into grilled meat go on a Friday and try the ghorme sabzi - it's an absolutely amazing herb and meat stew. For starters, try the mixed starter to get a taste of everything.

Maybe it's correct as the restaurant is very small and there can be long queues to get in on cold winter nights. Winter however is the best time to visit Alounak which is busy, warm and served well with the special earthenware oven. The latter is used to make the delicious flat breads similar to the Indian roti and delicious with the mezze and meat.I have been coming to Alounak once or twice a year and eash time the food has been very tasty. The portions have got smaller but this appears to be the case everywhere. My favourite is the mixed platter which is for two people. It come with lamb shish, chicken cutlets and beef strips. Each has excellent flavour and texture. The beef is extremely good and I appreciate its flavour even after eating it. I do not remember eating any desserts at Alounak as I fill myself up on the starter and main. Alcoholic drinks can be brought in and there is a Sainsbury or Waitrose nearby with a decent wine selection. Service is excellent as the many beautiful waitresses are quick to serve and very polite. The toilet is clean although located on the third floor. The murals are everywhere in Alonak which is quite pleasant.I have eaten Turkish, Greek and Persian and of all the meats the Persian is my favourite. If you need a good place to eat in Bayswater and not a vegan then I would definitely recommend Alounak.",

Perhaps their meat options are better?I don't see myself going back but I was happy with the service and experience!",

The rice, bread and meat all one better than the other... Will be sure keep going here .. I also like the fact that it is a small place which is warm and nice.. It is always busy so you might end up waiting .. But it is great ..",

Like I think our server was literally frozen because she didn't listen to a word we said. Example: Her: How many pieces of bread do you want? Us: How big are they? Her: So, one basket then? Us: OK?As it turns out, one basket of bread is enough for two people with a plate of hummus.The portion size of our mains were gigantic. We could have easily skated by with one main + hummus + one basket of bread and this would have been the perfect meal size. We ordered different mains - our favorite were the minced lamb skewers (or something of that nature). Yum!Avoid the tables near the door as the oven gives off a lot of heat! Oh, and if you take your leftovers to go, note that they will smell like poop and if you bring those leftover on the Tube, then note that you will make the entire carriage smell like poop. I don't know why the leftovers smell like poop but you are just going to have to take my word for it. (Note: They don't taste like poop, though I've never tasted poop, so I guess I can't be 100% on this statement.)Will definitely return to Alounak, however, order the right amount of food so I do not have to take poop-smelling leftovers on the Tube.",

We walked in and noticed it was quite busy for a weekday- always a good sign. It is not a large place but it is definitely homey. There is a large, clay pot \u00a0when you walk in in which they make the bread to order. It was nice to be able to see how it was done while we ate. And whatever amount of bread you order- double it because that's really what you'll eat! It is served immediately after making and is warm and soft and absolutely addicting! We just kept ordering more. As to the food we started with the mixed appetizer platter which comes with a variety of dips to try- all of them were amazing! Even their version of a potato salad is unlike anything I've tried. My favorite dip was the one made with eggplant. For the entrees we all ordered number 26 and it was big enough for two! It gives you a little taste of everything. It comes with chicken, lamb skewer, and minced lamb kebab. The chicken- which I normally never order anywhere- was probably my favorite because it was so moist and flavorful. The minced lamb kebab was also great because of the flavors. The lamb skewer was my least favorite because it was overcooked and a little dry. \u00a0 Overall however the food was delicious and different from the Lebanese cuisine I'm so familiar with. The service was wonderful as well. All the girls were very helpful and attentive. It was one of the meals I most enjoyed while in London- and it's friendly on the wallet!",

This place is cheap, but it's not worth it at all. Last, I saw a server dipping cups in a bucket to wash it. She didn't wash anything. That was barely a rinse. I also saw her dump water out of a water pitcher from a table then reuse it without washing it. Sanitation must not be important here.",

    "text": "This was the first time I ever had Iranian cuisine. And I am in love with it. I realize that the Persians, now known as Iranians, have had a great influence on North Indian cuisine. The bread they have is what has evolved into Roti/Naan etc in India. The clay pot oven they use to make it is what evolved into what we call the tandoor. I don't know much of the history but the Persians definitely came to India a long time ago and did some good and bad things. I wish to say the food was probably the best thing they gave us. Now getting to the food one of my friends and I had, chicken special. It was marinated cubes of chicken grilled in their oven. Not sure if it is the clay pot oven or the normal grill. But the rice was special. They had plain basmati kind of white rice, with some special yellow coloured basmati type rice on top of it. As we all know saffron is an expensive spice, that obviously meant, the saffron spiced rice was just a topping. They served us two of their local breads, it has a very different name from the Indian bread so I don't really remember what they called it. And we ordered one of the aubergine based vegetarian starter dish which we had with the Iranian bread. It was bloody brilliant. The marinated Chicken cubes also tasted amazing. But the only main course vegetarian item on the menu was served with the same sort of rice combination with a slightly less impressive vegetarian gravy based dish. The gravy didn't taste as rich but the rice was just as good as the others. After the meal to top it all up, we ordered their traditional sweet, Zolbiah and balmieh. Indians know Zolbiah as Zalebi or Jalebi depending on which part of India you belong to. Over all, I loved the food, the music, the tea and what not!I would definitely recommend this place to my friends, especially those that love lamb. I would love to go there again to try out many of their other dishes too.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and the servers were pleasant. I was hoping the food would be a bit more of a home run, but it was still good and I'd recommend it if you're in the area. Not worth a trip over there, though, as there wasn't anything special.This was my first time eating specifically Persian food. I'm quite familiar with Middle Eastern food in general, but had never properly sat down at a Persian restaurant before. Many of the dishes throughout the Middle East have similarities, so the food wasn't foreign to be at all.Salad Shirazi - cucumber, tomato, onion, and herbs. These were chopped incredibly small and seemed more similar to a salsa than a salad. Not much flavor, but the salad did seem fresh.Mast-o-khiyar - chopped cucumber and herbs mixed with home made yogurt. I was really hoping this would be better. I love yogurt in general, but this one wasn't as thick and creamy as I'd hoped. It was rather thin. Also, I didn't care too much for the flavor. I'm not sure if it was the abundance of mint or something else, but I wasn't crazy about it.Taftoon bread - not good. It was burnt and crispy instead of soft and fluffy. Super thin and it was essentially like a large cracker instead of bread. We couldn't eat half of it because of the texture. Also, no real flavor.Chelo-kabab koobedeh - two skewers of minced lamb served with grilled tomato and rice. So this dish is split. The rice (basmati and saffron rice) was subpar. They just didn't nail it as the texture was off and there wasn't any flavor. The lamb, on the other hand, was the best part of the entire meal. The flavor, the texture, everything about it was just spectacular. Soft, moist, delicious. I would highly recommend getting as much lamb as possible here.Iranian Tea - not a huge fan of mint, but wanted to try this as it's traditional. Quite good and unique. The tea cups and sugar bowls are beautiful.The price is reasonable and the portions aren't too small. The hallway leading to the bathroom is really lovely.",
