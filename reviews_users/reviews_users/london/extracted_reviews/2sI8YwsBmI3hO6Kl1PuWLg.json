A great place to impress someone at lunchtime. Main fault, the coffee cups were too wide. I know, too fussy! more than made up for this by having very pretty staff :)",

    "text": "This is a gorgeous space tucked away off Great Sutton Street - huge old warehouse with plain brick walls, high ceilings and huge windows, which though they look out onto more walls, bring a lovely soft light to the room. Sign outside says more tables upstairs but the door there is locked and you must go back to the other end of the building to gain entry, but once you're in you should grab any available space. This place is mega busy so tables are at a premium. Food is good - fresh and served in generous portions. My only gripe is the service - it's simply not all that. When I asked the waitress what came in the roast pork sandwich she looked surprised and said she didn't know, said she could find out then said just to tell her what I didn't want and it wouldn't be on it. So I ordered the pork without mustard or raw onions and a beer, while my friend ordered ham and cheese and a cola. Two minutes later she was back to tell me there was no pork left - what else would I like. But she didn't have a menu so I just chose what I could remember, then two minutes after that she was back, again sans menu, to tell my friend there was no cola. Finally got food and drinks delivered and it was good and tasty. She cleared the table, we asked for the bill and.... nothing. Ten minutes later I went to the counter to pay to be told that if I sat down someone would bring me a bill. Had to go so finally got someone to take my money. for food, it is good. for ambience, it is good. for service #fail.",

Open Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm and Saturday from 10am to 4pm, it's an ideal place do a little work; in fact I blogged about this wonderful place for Londonist (londonist.com/2009/11/lo\u2026) while enjoying a tasty breakfast there. Ah, free wifi - it's a beautiful thing. The coffee's very good here, the food's wholesome and the atmosphere's exceptional!",

Had lunch there on a weekend: delicious vegetarian soup served in a beautiful Japanese-style stone bowl with a side of scrumptious Irish soda bread for me and a roast chicken salad for my companion. We both enjoyed our meal very much. The prices weren't bad - including a couple of coffees (good too), the total bill came to under \u00a314. We ate outside on one of the motley crew of tables tastefully arranged, but the inside of the cafe' is lovely with wood, exposed brick, open kitchen, wide tables and friendly staff. I will certainly return and take friends.",

And these are the reasons why you should come here as well: First: the waiting staff was most forthcoming when we wanted a table that was part-shade and part sunshine - we simply rearranged the table.Second: the menu was not overwhelmingly big, but what was on the menu tickled all of our taste buds in various ways. On top of that, they had a nice selection of daily specials, which our waitress recited slowly and comfortably.Third: My vegetarian lasagna (one of the daily specials) was delicious and the size of the portion was just right. Also, my colleagues seemed to be very pleased with their food. Fourth: Although we had chosen to sit outside, I will come back to truly experience the clean and comfy inside space. This is what I really call an authentic space - not pretentious, but not to slick either; in fact, it's a place where you can forget about work for a while...",

The poached eggs were overdone, and when they asked if everything was ok and I told them about the eggs, they said \"Oh\" and did not even offer to make me properly poached eggs! The potato cakes I was looking forward to, as the thing that would set this veg breakfast apart - and make it worth \u00a37.50! - were just large, dry lumps of under-seasoned potato. A dab of beans and a tiny piece of mushroom, and some actually delicious toast completed my breakfast. My partner had the J+A breakfast with bacon, sausage, and black pudding, and the meat was pretty good, but that was \u00a310.50.I won't be going back with this kind of service or poor value for money. The cakes looked great, as did the baked potato toppings, but \u00a38.50 for a potato is ridiculous. Elk in the Woods at Angel also has veg breakfasts for \u00a0\u00a37.50, but I prefer their potato and their service. And their meat brekkie is also \u00a0\u00a37.50, with organic meat.",

But it's quite a well known secret because by the time we got there, they had nearly run out of everything I wanted to order. (But Hurrah, they found the last pie for me- I was seriously lucky last week!)The hot chocolate came with a monster marshmallow. None of this mini stuff, and IT WAS amazing, I'm sure it would be more amazing if i left it in the hot choc for longer....We also ordered steak sandwich and the quiche. The quiche was super pea-y (I dont know how else to describe it, but the expensive peas, not the frozen ones. amazing flavour!) And my pie was excellent, it came with a mountain of mash that I didn't end up finishing because I think I would've died from pastry and potato overload, there wasn't alot of meat in the pie, which is my complaint.It's fresh food, and the prices reflect the area, so it's not cheap but it's a solid option for lunch/work lunch. It's got nice open spaces and a communal table too.",

Yeah, yeah, yeah - I know what you're going to say: \"But Jenn, this is London, you're never gonna get the same level of service as in the states.\" No more excuses! It's time London steps up to the plate.We got to J+A at around 1:15 and were immediately impressed by how cute the cafe was and how busy it was for being around the city. That said, the place is also huge with two main dining areas on the ground floor and outdoor seating, as well as another area on the first floor. We were seated immediately and ordered coffees and juices before perusing the menu - mainly classic breakfast dishes - typical full English, eggs florentine, sweet or savory pancakes. I opted for the eggs royale and my brunch mate had the J+A breakfast. Nearly 40 minutes later we had well finished our drinks and our meals still hadn't arrived. It seemed like other patrons came and went and we were staring down waitresses trying to get someone to acknowledge our presence.To be fair, someone finally came over and kindly apologised for the wait. However, I would've preferred a bit of an explanation as to why our meal was taking so long... even if it was that they forgot it. \u00a0When the food finally arrived at our table, it was tasty and excellent. The coffee here is delicious too! And those are the right elements for a nice Saturday brunch. I'll still search London for better, but would be willing to give J+A another chance.",

There isn't much to report that others haven't said, but I think that breakfast is my favourite meal here-- if I recall correctly, the eggs are a bit decadent in a good way (as in buttery/creamy). I also had an excellent scone with Devonshire cream and pretty good coffee. The 'hidden away' aspect of the space really adds to the food, I must say, adding a bit of 'oh, wow, this is here?' factor. Probably not a good space for big groups, as it is both small and popular, but a for two to four it is just right.",

Daily specials are hand written on the chalk board there are scattered communal tables and super laid-back servers who give you space yet don't leave you waiting. J&A Caf\u00e9 is a hidden secret in London, a haven from the hustle and bustle of the city, it can get busy mid-morning to lunchtime with local workers but get their early enough and you'll get a seat.Now the coffee was lovely but not quite as mind blowing as Tomtoms, an Americano not filter was available, with it's smooth and slightly bitter undertones it hit the caffeine nail on the head. And as with every venue that serves coffee it rightly had a loo, with fresh flowers in it! My life is complete. Will I be back? Yes, I just wish there was more in the area that gave me a reason to hang out around here more.",

That's what I love about the area though, there's always a little gem hiding just off the main roads. It's got a little spike of a mid-day rush but if you catch it off-peak there's usually a table available to stake out and catch up with your newspaper or friends over some of their tempting pastries.",

On our visit chicken was obviously the coice du jour - there was a chicken salad, roast chicken sarnies and chicken pie. Now chicken can be pretty tasteless, even at half-decent places, like stringy white slabs of nothing. Not here. Here they're moist and tasty - not afraid to add a dash of thigh and leg to the ubiquitous breast. These were chickens that were allowed to roam wild and free before the chop - you can practically taste the wide open fields. The cafe itself is a tres busy warehouse conversion - all bare brick walls and old school tables, big windows and high ceilings. It's just right because all that light and vertical space gives a the whole a spacious feeling, even when super crowded. Rumour has it that this is where Torode and his masterchef buddy come to eat as well - so it's not just me who likes the chicken. And I didn't even get on to the tottering towers of moist, loose crumb cake...",

Repeat: THIS IS A BAR in the evenings. After the brunch and lunch items are stowed away and the sun starts to fade, guests can still pop into the alley and into the beautifully paned and glass paneled building that houses the spirts, beers and wines... In addition to a fantastic bar staff. You might even find yourself treated to one of the best Cucumber Gimlets in London...dare I say, the world. Followed by a Sloe Berry \u00a0(sloe gin + french sparkling, oo la la) you'll be tottering off to dinner a bit worse for the wear, but surely much more bubbly and full of gin-inspired hubris. Oh, wait. Yes, that was me last night. I've enjoyed a lunch, brunch, breakfast on occasion at J&A and have always been quite happy. Tucked away (as others mention), nice simple food that is hearty and well thought out. Friendly service. Their bar area is greatly underrepresented -- and thus, I felt it was my civic Yelp duty to inform the masses. If you are seeking libations in Clerkenwell, do not skip over J&A thinking it just to be a daytime cafe. The magic truly comes out to play at night. I shall return, as should you. It's not crowded, but I can't say it will stay that way for long -- I have to imagine anyone that pops in for a cocktail (in the most proper of stemware, no less...swoon) and finds this gem nestled between the alleys (and not brimming with drunks) takes a deep breath and promises \"I'll surely be back.\" There's a BAR here. A good one. In case you didn't catch it...",

It happened I was walking around, looking for another place to have my late coffee on a Sunday afternoon and suddenly, a group of people stepped out of a door that led to an alley that led me to J+A Caf\u00e9.There are two buildings, one on each side of the alley. One of them is a coffee shop where you can have brunch/lunch and the other, apparently, is a bar. I just went to the 'restaurant' part because all I wanted was some coffee and cake.The place is really nice, airy and bright, with simple decoration. The staff was lovely, always with a smile on their faces even though it was almost closing time. Always appreciated.Brunch was over when I arrived, so I didn't have a chance to try the food. But I did try the cakes and they were wonderful. I had the Chocolate Guinness Cake with Baileys and clotted cream on the side and I just have one word to describe it: MARVELLOUS!The coffee was also really good. Much better than the one you will get for the same price in any high street chains.",

And because their incredible desserts are also always on display, I can't help to get a delicious slice every time. Apparently all their food is sourced from their own gardens, hence why everything tastes so good. And lastly the staff... they are all very friendly and it seems they love working at JA Cafe. Well, I love eating at JA Cafe! Will miss working close to this place.",

Love!HUGE baked potatoes with generous fillings, delicious sandwiches and a whole array of ever-changing specials make J+A Caf\u00e9 a lunchtime-must, not to mention the vast selection of cakes, cookies, brownies and other sweet treats decorating the counter-space.We were sat up on the first floor which was empty when we arrived just after 12pm and packed to the rafters when we left an hour or so later. I had the club sandwich - chicken, bacon, salad, avocado etc. on fresh white bread. I'm not sure if they bake the bread in-house but I wouldn't be surprised, it was deliciously doughy.Although being absolutely stuffed after the huge sarnie, which came with a scattering of vegetable crisps, I couldn't help but partake in sharing a slice of Chocolate and Guiness Cake with Josephine B and Kevin L. With a generous layer of icing, a splodge of cream on the side with a dash of Baileys over the top, I enjoyed the cake very much. It had an interesting texture, hard to put into words, perhaps slightly stodgier than your average cake, yet I loved the almost bitter taste of Guiness paired with the sweetness of chocolate. It wasn't sickly but quite rich and I don't think I could have managed a whole slice to myself!Still...never say never!",

Feel like having a hearty breakfast or early lunch and enjoy a newspaper (or, for the posh amongst you, an iPad)? J+A Caf\u00e9 is just the spot you're looking for.Late morning on a brisk autumn Saturday, I rolled in here to catch one of the few remaining spots available at the long picnic table in the centre of the dining room. Armed with my trusty Galaxy S and an e-book I'd been working on for a few months (an old favourite, Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber), I whiled away over an hour just flipping virtual pages, sipping on the most massive of Americanos, and forking through a mound of scrambled eggs and salmon on toast.The servers bustle all around without seeming to be in a hurry. Other patrons carry on a low humming din of conversation, and the majority of individual patrons are immersed in their separate musings and cogitations. Honestly, I'm shocked -not- to see a sea of Macbooks glowing their merry Apple emblems away here.While prices aren't stupidly affordable (see Le Regal for that), you won't leave hungry or feeling cheated. And a refreshed, placid state of mind is one well worth dropping a few extra pounds on.",

We shared a long table with another group of people, which is ok in general but then the table wasn't that large, we were a bit squeezed, seats were uncomfortable, the order was taken wrong, service was slow. I was a bit embarrassed I brought my guests there. I would go back for a coffee or a light breakfast during the week may be. But definitely not a proper weekend brunch with more than 2 friends.",

A great place for brunch on the weekend and a great place for lunch during the week. They always have a selection of awesome cakes and the coffee isn't too bad either. Tucked away in an alley its great in both winter and summer. Very nice indeed.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, I REALLY, REALLY like \u00a0J+A Caf\u00e9. I really do. (Really). I just happened to experience a collection of minor annoyances when there (and afterward, which I won't get into too much detail about...but I will say that there were a lot of fruit-flavoured antacids involved). Sadly, these minutia added up and collectively discoloured my time at J+A.The spot itself is beyond adorable -- while its presence is indicated by a small sign flanking the excessively shop-and-cafe-laden Clerkenwell Road, J+A Caf\u00e9 is actually recessed within a small courtyard slightly behind street-level. This courtyard, furthermore, is everything you'd want a little, indie, hippie, summery courtyard to be, with red, white, and blue bunting hanging above the walkway, fairy lights streaming in the same fashion, and appropriately shabby-chic, slightly rusted, coloured steel patio furniture along each side of the yard. However, as it was daytime, and it was a lovely 3 degrees outside, we could not sit in said area. Entry into J+A is a tiny bit confusing, as it is split into two buildings, if you will -- on the right, the bar, and on the left, the restaurant and caf\u00e9. Both were packed when we approached (and it was about 2pm...I suppose it is 5 o'clock somewhere), so it was difficult to tell which one to enter. We ultimately opted for the left door, and ended up in a very woodsy, earthy-looking room, complete with wooden 'community'-style tables and benches, flower pots and watering cans abound, and a huge chalkboard with the specials of the day written on them. The caf\u00e9 itself isn't very large, so a server spotted us immediately and sat us at the only open table.So, here is where my small annoyances start. I'll list them here.1) I ordered the garden pea and goats cheese quiche, which came with a regular, mixed greens salad and a 'special' salad (either the seasonal veg of the day, a quinoa, cous-cous, or barley type of grain salad, a brown rice salad, or potato salad). However, I was really craving soup, and asked the server whether I could get a side of soup, instead of the salads, with my quiche. 2) No. I would have to get an entire, \u00a36.50 serving of soup, in addition to the \u00a310 quiche with salads that I didn't really want in the first place. This was apparently due to the till not being able to accept side orders of soup. Okay, fair enough, I guess. I didn't want to eat \u00a0a full portion of soup on top of a full meal, so I just let it go. I had asked the server what her favourite side dish was, and she said the brown rice dish; I wasn't really feeling that, so I ordered the veg of the day as my side salad (which happened to be braised cabbage)...or so I thought.3) We were, admittedly, in a hurry, so it didn't help matters that the food took a little longer than average to come out -- about 25-30 minutes. I think we ended up waiting longer for our food to be cooked than we spent eating it.4) When my quiche (finally) came, the plate had both the brown rice and braised cabbage on it. Why, I will never understand. I did not ask for the rice. And...we were still charged for the rice. Which, again, I did not ask for. Since it was just a single portion, and already covered in braised cabbage juices, I figured I'd just shut up and let it go (a recurring theme, it seems).5) Remember when I mentioned that the bar and caf\u00e9 are separate from one another? Turns out, the kitchen is also located where the bar stands...across the courtyard. One wouldn't think that a 10 second walk outside would affect the temperature of food much...but the entire top half of my quiche was cold, as was the rice.6) Garden pea quiche, to me, means a quiche WITH garden peas in it. Not a ladle-full of garden peas with a bit of egg thrown in there to hold it together, and crust on the bottom. It was all pea, no quiche. It's a good thing I don't mind peas, but not as a main dish...I don't know. I guess I ordered the wrong thing. 7) Since the restaurant space is small, as I've mentioned, every time a server happened to walk by our table, my bag and coat kept getting knocked off the part of the bench I had placed them on top of. This happened throughout our meal.8) As our meal was coming to an end (which was another prolonged event, as it took ages to get the bill), I ordered a soya latte to go. When it came, I was given a bowl of sugar cubes, but no spoon. After some internal debate as to whether I was that desperate for some sugar on top of the caffeine boost (the answer is always 'yes'), I ended up using my finger as a stir-stick. Only after I had done this did the server notice and ask me if I wanted a spoon...I'm prepared to give J+A Caf\u00e9 another chance because I'm a real sucker for a great ambience, and fairy lights. However, I will be ordering something else, and I will bring my own spoon just in case...",

Hidden down a little alley way, there are two sides, one side for brunch/Lunch and the other is a bar. I still need to try the bar side, but the other side is lovely. Its a lovely space with a great atmosphere. The coffee is so good too, much better than all the coffee chains on the high street, and the sweet pancakes are delicious!

    "text": "Absolutely 5 stars. Service? Ambiance? Food? ALL FIVE STARS!! I really really loved this place!! We were in the area for a graduation at the barbican centre (about a 10 minute walk away), and decided to have some breakfast there beforehand. We actually only had about 20 minutes to eat and I thought that this cozy little place would probably take about 3x as long. However, I was wrong! When we arrived, the hostess let us sit wherever we wanted. We chose the outdoor seating, which was absolutely beautiful- flowers everywhere, penant decorations- it is a very cute place. Diners were outside working on their laptops, having meetings, and we could just enjoy being together and feeling the early morning breeze and chirping birds. We ordered our food and drinks together since we were in such a hurry- a coffee and orange juice, one eggs Benedict and one Florentine Benedict. To my pleasant surprise the orange juice was freshly squeezed- my favorite! The drinks came out within 5 minutes and the food probably 5 minutes after that! This little cafe really specializes in its bread. They have homemade bread and use it in all of their dishes so needless to say, the English muffins in the Benedicts were AMAZING - big and fluffy, they just soak in all of that silky hollandaise sauce. The eggs were poached nicely and no extra, unnecessary sides- just the benedicts on the plate. It really was a meal to remember **I'm describing this exactly one week later** \u00a0If you go inside the cafe, which is also where you'll pay, you will see the HUGE and equally BEAUTIFUL loaves of bread that they use in their dishes and are available for purchase! We saw the chef slicing off a piece of sourdough bread for someone's order and I did get a little jealous even though I had just finished my meal! I will DEFINITELY be back! However, next time I'll be lengthening my stay!",

We ordered several glasses of the rose and prosecco and had the chicken soup, roast chicken sandwich and crab and aioli on soda bread.

    "text": "Super adorable cafe tucked in a thin alleyway off Clerkenwell Road. It has plentiful outdoor seating and some tables inside that are good for working over a hearty meal and a nice hot drink. WiFi available as well so it's employee-friendly for those looking to work remote or hold a biz meeting. The open kitchen, hardwood, and dim lighting give it both a modern and rustic feel, which I fully appreciate.The latte art can use some spiffing up. My first flat white was basically a \"dump milk as fast as possible over espresso, here you go,\" sort of scenario. Second one was better but not great. No biggie as it tasted just fine but I'd think a venue like this would want to focus a bit on the presentation...The assortment of pastries and cakes are plentiful (Guinness cake available, and they make the finest looking English muffins I've ever seen in the flesh). Specialty dishes change out daily so definitely make sure to check out the chalk board. The staff are quick to tend to your table, meals available for eat-in or take out. \u00a0I hear this place morphs into a bar later in the evening, which I can imagine could be quite fun out in the courtyard area in the warm months. I'll have to return to check it out.",

Glad I finally made it.Because of its hidden location, I was able to walk in on a Saturday at 11.30 am (prime brunch time) and get a table right away. Although the place was busy, at no point did it become super full or booked out in the hour or so I was there.Highlights from this place is the open plan kitchen venue, it's open and cosy at the same time. I had an Americano which was very good not bitter at all but nicely potent. We'd made it here based on other Yelp pics of their pancakes (is it me or is it quite hard to find great pancakes in London?). We were not disappointed. I got the savoury pancakes (bacon, eggs, pancakes, maple syrup) and my friend got them with fruit and cream. They were fluffy and tasty and I left feeling full but not stodgy which can sometimes happen with doughy pancakes.A few things to bear in mind: Syrup comes poured over; next time I would request it on the side, as I like to do the syrup pouring myself. I love bacon but I was with a friend who doesn't eat pork and it smelt pretty porky in there - bacon haters beware.Lastly, I've heard their chocolate guinness cake is amazing - after two pancake dishes we weren't really up for it, but it looked divine!",

It was slightly busy but when you sit outside you could almost be anywhere on a sunny day like today!The waitress was slightly slow today but as always they were busy and we were in no rush so no harm, no foul. I'm still on my healthy stint and opted for the omelette filled with mushrooms, tomatoes, ham, and spinach with a side of beans. The food came quickly and was presented well. The omelette is served with white toast also, just so you're aware :)My omelette was absolutely delicious! It was cooked perfectly, and there was plenty of filling. The ham in particular was to die for: salty, soft and it melted in your mouth. Complemented by buttery mushrooms, crunchy spinach and juicy tomatoes - what more could you ever want?! Another fantastic experience at J+A! I couldn't recommend it more!",

I love that you actually can't see this from the street (I missed it 2 times the first time I came here). I love the inner courtyard, even now during the winter, because I can only imagine how great this is during summer...I went for the combo soup+sour bread at 6,5\u00a3, and it was delicious every time. I had to force myself not to grab my friend's roast-chicken sandwich, it really looked amazing. I went pretty light things, but everytime I see the \"stew\" on the menu, there's this little voice in my head that tells me..\"choose this\". Next time for sure!",

The staff were attentive and friendly.The food is traditional, Irish, homemade and incredibly tasty. It does take a while to appear at your table, as they make it then and there. No microwaved portions here. You have the option of tea and cake or the simple lunch menu. All so equally good, you'll end up eating more than you expected to.",

These exist right?This week is Clerkewell Design Week and I thought, oooo all these people are heading over to this nutella pancake stand and it looks free but I'm too scared to queue as I hadn't got the lanyard with the free ticket inside and lunch hour was fast ending. So what did I do? Nose around the yelp website, stalked Christoph's recent haunts around the area as he works nearby, and found out he went to the J+A Takeaway place. Lo and behind, I saw a sign pointing into a courtyard that J+A Cafe was right there so I had to pop in and have a look!The lady inside explained this wasn't the takeaway shop but you can do takeaways here too and I was happy! The salads look amazingly fresh and they gave me 3 huge pieces of freshly cooked chicken. It was nice juicy and just slightly overcooked (this could have happened on the way back to the office though) but i was impressed!Price was a bit on the high end \u00a314 for a chicken salad, but I literally split the meal into two and ate the leftovers the next day. So around \u00a37 for lunch. Not bad.Whilst waiting I was being nosy about the rest of the diners' food and they all looked delicious! The cafe was pretty packed but there was an outdoor seating courtyard outside which patrons of this cafe may or may not be able to utilise. They also have tiny benches for you to sit on next to the walls of the cafe while you wait for a table/takeaway! Brownie points!",

J+A is big, there are at least three distinct bits, and we sat upstairs which wasn't rammed. Service was friendly, and we each ordered a fairly simple lunch option. My quiche with salad was OK, nothing amazing but not terrible. My companion's potato wasn't baked to that point with a crispy skin, so was a bit meh. I think this looks like a great place for coffee and cakes, or for drinks on a sunny evening, but I'm not rushing back for a full meal.",

    "text": "J+A is literally right around the corner from my office. Despite having walked down this street about 1,000 times, I never knew that this place existed. This is because it is VERY hidden. On my first visit, I used my phone and even my iPhone was confused on how to navigate me there and took the VERY long way. You can cut through a little tunnel from Clerkenwell road into this beautiful courtyard. This tunnel literally transports you to another world. J+A is tucked away and peaceful. It is a very nice location.The staff are pretty friendly and the food is very good. My only complaint and why I havent given it five stars is that it is quite complicated to order takeaway from here. You can't order via the phone and can only order through e-mail. The person who manages the e-mail is quite slow so you spend quite a few hours wondering if the order has even gone through. It is also, unless I'm blind, quite hard to find the menu online. I ended up having to visit the restaurant to get a hold of a menu, which wasn't a big deal. This was my only complaint and it's a pretty minor one.",
