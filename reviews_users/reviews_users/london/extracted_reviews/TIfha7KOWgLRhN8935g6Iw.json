My husband and I had a bottle of rose and we were a table of 4 and didn't even come close to 100 pounds. \u00a0My kids asked to go back there almost every day for a week, but being new to London, I insisted on trying new places. \u00a0We did go back 3 weeks later before we moved to St Johns Wood--it didn't disappoint.",

Go for one of their specials and you will not be disappointed. I have gone back again and again and it has always been great - and certainly cheaper than the air fare to Italy.

I would put the pricing as moderate, though dinner for two is easily over 200 USD if you are going to have wine (I had Pinot Grigio that was excellent, dry and crisp with none of the fruity aftertaste of the PGs in the states). The service is very friendly, big open italian smiles, and just plain nice. Here is what I had: the Insalati di Mare (very light, just the right portion, the clams and shrimp where a bit tough, but overall a nice intro to the meal), followed by the scallopina porcini which was recommended by the waitress. \u00a0This veal came in a wine porcini mushroom sauce that was fantastic. Also came with a spinach \"cake\" that was merely steamed spinach formed in a round cake shape. \u00a0Still good but underdelivered my expectations. I had the cheese assortment for dessert and take home fare. Overall, I loved the place. The atmosphere was big city, that is you were up against tables on each side with about 10 in of room between tables. Not NY \"close\", but still close enough to eavesdrop on several conversations in English and Italian. Ver entertaining.",

Both were right out of central and southern Italy. The spaghetti bolognese was strong and appropriately balanced. The desserts are something that is very surprising. \u00a0Simple, but elegant - vanilla or hazelnut gelato with amaretto or Nutella. I know what you're thinking -- doesn't sound that impressive. Read: this is reason enough to go here! Spectacular! We finished every meal with a delicious lemoncello that was the perfect digestive. Another absolutely awesome part if this experience was the staff. Attentive and polite --- great reason to have dinner here for a special occasion. So why not 5 stars? Well the minestrone soup was slightly weak and under salted. \u00a0One veal dish was slightly dry and would have benefitted from a sauce. But don't let these two things take away from this Kensington star. You will not be disappointed.",

The meat that was ordered (veal with mushrooms and another veal dish) were completely terrible with bad cuts of meat and over cooked mushy mushrooms and tough meat. I thought to myself, people must only come here for the pizza.Upon my next visit... I was even more upset when I left. A friend and I ordered two different pizzas, we waited a very long time for anything to come out even though everyone else around us was being served very quickly. When food did arrive it was a pizza cut in half on two separate plates. We informed the manager that this was not our order. He came back three times to confirm what the correct orders where and we waited. The food then arrived about 15 mins later. One pizza was what was ordered but the other was the same two sides of the pizza COLD and just placed together on the plate. He was upset when I requested a fresh pizza. Unacceptable.When the new pizza did arrive half of it didn't have any cheese on it and it was under cooked yet burnt at the same time. I am very sad to say that I actually paid for this meal although I ate hardly any of it. The corner shop supplied the rest of my dinner. I want to like this place, as I live about 1 min away. But alas it was not meant to be. Seeing as there are so many Italian places on this street, I would steer clear and go somewhere else.",

The girlfriend is now my wife and La Pappadella is now not so good. \u00a0Id chalk it up to a one time failure but it was an ingredients issue more than preparation. The cheese on the pizza was of such poor and tasteless quality that neither myself nor my wife enjoyed our pizzas whatsoever. I'd give 1 star but I didn't throw up.",

The wine list was nice and we picked a barbera for 23$ . Started off with the antipasti misto which was also tasty. Moved on to the carbonara which we split . It was filling and the pasta was al dente and the sauce was sticky ( in a good way) then it was pizza time and the crust was thin and perfect and the sauce was tasty . Well we couldn't stop there so we ordered some gelato with limoncello , a panna cotta, and a cappuccino. We devoured them like children and was now stuffed . The owner brought us \u00a0some limoncello shots afterwards and it capped off our first night in London. \u00a0Laura was our server and she was fantastic but all the girls were pretty helpful and teamwork was inspiring. \u00a0next time in London we will be back !",

This quaint little Italian eatery had such character and I loved that the majority of diners seemed to be regulars. The waitresses on staff that night were both attentive, friendly and Italian speaking. They answered any questions I had, and made the experience a great one. I ordered the gnocchi with tomato cream sauce and basil. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was a wonderful complement. I was full after eating half of my meal, but it was so good that I finished most of the gnocchi on my plate. I had read a review raving about the chocolate souffle dessert, and decided that I must have it... for research purposes, of course. :) It was delightful. The richness of the chocolate was paired perfectly with the sweet neutrality of the vanilla ice cream.All-in-all, would I go back? Of course! I intend to! Would I recommend to friends? Absolutely!Happy Dining!",

    "text": "For an Italian restaurant in London, this place is rockin'! The prices here are great. as everyone else mentioned, they have a lot of pizzas, but there are tons of other options. I was looking around the restaurant and saw lots of people ordering pastas, main courses, and of course, pizzas. I went with a colleague and we both got the same dish: Tagliatelle _____ (bacon, cream sauce, and some other items -- can't recall!). It was awesome. The portions are HUGE!!! All of the portions for most all the dishes are HUGE! You can definitely split one dish with another person. AMBIANCE: Loud! It's not a place you want to take a date for a nice, quiet dinner. This place is casual, loud, etc. It's a place you would go with friends to have some drinks (wine/beer) and pizza or a snack to eat. Also, the place is small (though I believe they have two stories), but it has a lot of character. SPACIOUS? You are almost sitting elbow to elbow. There's enough space for one body to fit through to be seated near the wall. You're fairly close to those next to you and if you listen very, very closely (amongst the noise!), you might hear something .... but you'd have to listen hard! Also, I saw a couple tables where you could have up to 6-8 people seated -- at least on the top floor. They may have larger tables on the floor below, but up top, you could have 6-8 people seated. Prices are VERY reasonable for London. Our still water was about 2.5 GBP (approximately). Our dishes were about 8-10 GBP for the pasta dishes. The pizza dishes were approximately 8 GBP (give or take). DESSERT: We also ordered the souffle (chocolate, with liquid center, whipped cream, and vanilla). It was very good. I believe our neighbors saw us eating it and ordered some as well. Oh, their house wine today (I didn't pay attention) was pretty good. a red house wine -- if you like dry. All in all, the food was tasty, portions huge, and value was great. Would definitely go again and would recommend to others. OH YEAH. I remembered. Our server didn't speak English too well. She had to go and get another server (time after time). I wasn't too bothered, but it slowed down our service time some.... when we first arrived, I could tell the people sitting next to us were waiting. They must have been waiting awhile to order their food. They contemplated leaving because they weren't getting good service. Eventually, they left. The people are extremely helpful and friendly, but the speed was not so great tonight. They're friendly people and enjoy people ... but they're not so quick to serve. They're having fun chatting it up with folks, too! Soooo, I wouldn't go expecting for the servers to be at your beck and call. (i.e. thats why I would say it's a \"casual\" place...)Hope this helps....!",

The gnocchi should be the star of the plate but it was served in a way where the sauce stole the show. \u00a0Nothing big but something to consider.",

    "text": "My mum recently sent me a list of places to get good pizza in London and I noticed that this place was just down the road from a meeting I was set to have. So sure enough after I was done I decided to come here for a late lunch and try it out.I had the garlic and tomato pizza bread as a starter, which I probably shouldn't have ordered since it was like 5 quid for some dough with tomato sauce on it, which even though it was tasty, just wasn't really worth it and really quite large. My main course was a lot better though!! I wanted to try a pizza but I noticed they were just one standard size which was just too much for me to eat at that time, so I ended up having gnocchi with the tomato sauce. That was ALSO quite filling and I couldn't quite finish it!! But it was really tasty so I was pleased all the same. Although I'm not sure if the gnocchi was freshly made in the restaurant since they all looked so uniform... I mean I'm sure the sauce was freshly made but I was a little disappointed as I noticed they had a \"fresh pasta\" section on the menu as well as regular pasta... The fresh section didn't have that much variety so that's why I didn't end up getting one of those dishes instead. I ended up taking my leftovers home which was a solid plan since I ended up eating them later that night... heheheh.... All in all it's a nice place but I wouldn't come out of my way to eat here. There were lots of children when I went as well as people who were eating on their own and doing work, so it's definitely a nice casual place to go if you're in the area!!",

Despite the warm service of the staff (all Italian young people) the food was absolutely atrocious: we ordered a \"mushroom risotto\" which wasn't a \"risotto\" (there is a proper specific technique to make risotto) but some sort of boiled rice with a red tomato \u00a0sauce (bad tomatoes, closer to ketch up than Italian sauce) with some cheap slices of mushrooms you couldn't even see. No taste, other that this awful tomato paste sauce. We couldn't \u00a0believe it. I didn't want to argue so just asked for the check and one espresso, thinking \"they are Italian, at least espresso will be good\" and I was wrong, it was as bad as an espresso you might get at an Irish pub. I rarely post reviews but I strongly believe restaurants have a huge responsibility because they play with our health, not just with a simple \"night out\" with friends. This restaurant doesn't serve authentic Italian food and definitely not healthy, good, tasty, well made food. Stay away !",

I would return. \u00a0The owner upstairs micromanages so it slows upstairs service. \u00a0Carleeto downstairs is prompt and quick. \u00a0You unfortunately need to speak up to get just about anything. \u00a0Once you get it. It's well worth it. \u00a0Great food always. Wins!!",

There are now more customers in the same tight space. While the food has remained consistent and quality good, the atmosphere has suffered. I have always enjoyed the service. Not a place for a romantic dinner.",

I have been to La Pappardella many times when traveling to London on business. \u00a0Its is a nice \"smart\" casual, but pleasant environment. \u00a0 They have sidewalk tables for weather friendly evening, dining area is a little tight but not bad, and pleasant downstairs room that the room opens up on nice evenings creating a fantastic ambience. The food is some of the best classic Italian I have ever had. \u00a0The Tiramisu is the best I have ever had. \u00a0Best of all is watching the Italian waitresses... just be a family of Italians.",

    "text": "There's a lot of mixed reviews here, some are great some are dire. Well I can honestly say I had a solid 3 star experience. The exterior doesn't look particularly appealing, but on walking in, it's quite a trendy looking place - I mean nothing amazing but it's a nice looking restaurant.Service was quick and attentive, there's lots of Italians working there, so you'd expect it to be pretty decent. I got a spritz - I prefer mine a little sweeter but it was nice enough. We ordered one pizza to share as we weren't very hungry. They were thoughtful enough to cut it in half and serve it on two plates without us asking, and the pizza was huge! I'll admit it wasn't the best pizza I've had (I lived in Italy for a year and a half, so my standard of Italian food is now pretty high) - however I would come here again if I were in the area.Overall a pleasant meal and experience - but nothing mind blowing or special.",

    "text": "If you haven't noticed based on a lot of my check ins/reviews, I love a good traditional pizza. Going on other reviews and pictures I decided on my latest layover in London, to pop on in to La Pappardella. Thankfully, it did not disappoint. I went with the Burratina pizza, which was quite tasty. Service was prompt and friendly and prices were really reasonable/quite good. The size of one pizza could easily feed just one person if you are hungry enough (as I was!) or could be split between two for a lighter/quick bite. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars as a solid choice for a nice Italian meal with good prices and service. I will be back. Bellissimo!",
