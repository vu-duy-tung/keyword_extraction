    "text": "My wife and I stumbled across this place on a recent visit to the area. \u00a0It was a cold and rainy April night that happened to be our birthday (same day but not same year). \u00a0We were soaked through, freezing, tired of walking around, and on the verge of a tantrum rivaled only by a sugar-smacked two year old so in we went with no knowledge of the place.The pigs foot door handle didn't go unnoticed and as a fan of all things porky, bacony, and cured meaty, I hoped it was indicative of things to come. \u00a0Lets face it, if eating salami and bacon everyday wouldn't kill you or bloat your butt like a beach ball wouldn't we all do it?Once inside we were met by a very pleasant hostess who informed us we could sit downstairs at any available spot or wait a short bit for a table upstairs. \u00a0We opted for two seats at the bar that were toward the grill in the back.Once seated the bar tendress promptly greeted us and offered drinks and menus. \u00a0We asked her to kindly recommend a white wine with a \"dry, earthy\" taste and she delivered. \u00a0As she poured she described not only the taste of the wine but where it came from, the soil, the grape, etc. \u00a0Other than knowing what I like in the taste of a wine, I know very little about wine. \u00a0However, I really like hearing about wine from someone who does know about wine (say that five times fast). \u00a0For all I know she could have been making everything up but the wine sure was good and her description made the experience even better. \u00a0Point being, the girl seemed to know her stuff.We were not rushed to order in any way and a bar back swiftly brought a board of grilled bread with olive oil and olives. \u00a0We listed to the bar tendress describe dishes to a group of guys sitting next to us and as she knew about the wine, she knew about the menu. \u00a0I always appreciate a knowledgeable staff and I am happy to tip and over-tip for good service.I could go on to describe every dish we had but I'll spare the space and just say that its hard to go wrong here. \u00a0Overall the atmosphere was casual cool with just as many blue jeans as tuxedos. \u00a0We took three hours to dine as we ordered one dish at a time and were never rushed in any way. \u00a0We left having tried 11 different dishes (small tapas style) and 3 different wines. \u00a0I highly suggest a stop in to this great little \"tavern\" next time you are in the area.",

    "text": "here some more pictures and stuff:hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  Opera Tavern is the second Spanish/ Tapas restaurant I have been to in a very short period of time. I have to admit that Tapas are not my favourite thing in the world, but even I got finally infected by the Tapas virus taking London by storm. While Tapas Brindisa in Soho was clearly nothing to write home about, I did enjoy almost everything about Opera Tavern in the heart of Convent Garden. It bodes well that team behind Opera Tavern is also behind the popular and highly regarded Salt Yard and Dehesa. You can eat informally or even more informally at Opera Tavern. The bar area downstairs in straight view of the new Shrek musical (enough to drive me to drink) was buzzing and crowded on a Friday evening. We booked a table upstairs in the restaurant part which is more sedate but at the same time you might be able to enjoy your food without someone knocking it over or having an elbow in your side and also conversation might be possible. Most of the food I really liked, in fact there were a couple of 'to die for' dishes which made me forgive some of the rather mediocre ones. I was told by a local that one 'needs to know what to order' at the Opera Tavern to avoid disappointment. I apparently knew what to order, as I was overall very happy, but mind, you I did ask my friend and Twitter for recommendations. I got the taste for padron peppers at Tapas Brindisa a couple of weeks ago and had to try them again at the Opera Tavern. Padron peppers are usually mild, with only occasional ones being spicy as hell. On the plate of padron peppers (4.25) at Opera Tavern about one third were spicy and I loved it! Tastewise I preferred the OT ones, while consistency and colour were better at Tapas Brindisa. A small plate of the fiocco di prociutto (4.50) and some bread with olive oil (2.50) were nice but at the same time forgettable. We were a bit annoyed actually that the bread came with olive oil OR alioli, for 2.50 they should have given both! A revelation and a really memorable dish was the Pork and Foie Gras Burger (5.95). The juicy and scrumptious meat was full of wonderful flavour and melted in my mouth. The bun must have been good too but I was so enthralled by what was going on on my palate that I did not pay any attention to details in this case. I can't say that I was able to discriminate pork and foie gras for example. This burger is a MUST ORDER. It's not cheap for being such a mini thing but this is one of the situations where money doesn't matter. I am wondering why people don't do pork burger more often actually. The Courgette Flowers with Goat's Cheese and Honey (7.55) were recommended to me by several people but for me this was the weakest dish of the evening. It was too sweet, reminiscent of a dessert rather than a main course. I think I would have liked it better if the goat's cheese had had a stronger flavour, putting a stronger counterpoint to the sweetness of the honey. I also thought the batter was too thick. I know this is a little bit mean now but the courgette flowers reminded me somehow of the fried bananas that I used to eat as a child at the neighbourhood Chinese. They did look similar too. As the last savoury dish we went for something that sounded rather Spanish to us. The Iberico presa (basically pork shoulder) came beautifully cooked in a rich sauce of capers and shallots. It is not going to win the prize for best presentation but the flavours were heavenly. Together with the burger the star of the evening was the dessert. Gorgeous and gelatinous tonka bean panna cotta spiced with cinnamon was served with sweet and summary British strawberries. It was of this comfort food desserts that you just want to dive into, pure bliss! The service was a delight. Friendly and sociable, helpful without being into your face and nice to look at. Opera Tavern is not cheap unfortunately. For these few plates, a bottle of the cheapest house wine (which by the way is a light and easy drinking wine, not bad at all) and 2 glasses of cava we paid close to 80 pounds for 2 people. I hope you are not planning to see Shrek The Musical. If you do so however, put some quality back into your evening at Opera Tavern :) I might see you there!",

    "text": "Opera tavern is nestled in the middle of bustling theatre land in Covent garden. This place is a buzzy wine bar and casual restaurant upstairs (not posh, just chilled). I am a great fan of Tapas Brindisa and all things tapas style, so was happy to discover this high end Spanish tapas and wine joint. Owned by the popular Salt yard people, this place has got it bang on target again. The food is fab fab fab. Highlights include the dinky iberico porky fois gras burgers (2 mini ones per person, order one each and be a JOEY from friends), mouthfuls of porky, luscious burger like no other. The patatas fritas were more like moreish mini chunky chips accompanied by garlicky aioli and bravas sauce (carbohydrate heaven mini style). Graze on a delectable charcuterie or cheese board or go for multiple attractive mini mains eg yum duck, seared lamb, scallops. The list is never ending. Not cheap but worth the extra dosh for outstanding spanish tapas. This is a perfect watering hole, post shopping, pre theatre, after a film or just for a catch up with a girly friend, all watered down with lashings of deep red Rioja. (monikasays.com )",

    "text": "Opera Tavern is the new venture from the Salt Yard Group, (restaurants Dehesa and Salt Yard) that opened last week in Covent Garden. The restaurant and bar occupies a two-storey space on Catherine Street, with a lively bar and few tables downstairs and a more peaceful dining room on the 1st floor. Opera Tavern's soft launch was the perfect opportunity to check out its range of Italian and Spanish inspired small plates - and also, it was 50%, which made it a bit easier on the wallet. Upon arrival, we were whisked upstairs to the first floor dining room and immediately proceeded to order some bread, which arrived lightly grilled alongside a big dollop of aioli and tided us over until we could decide what to order. We settled upon 9 dishes to share between the two of us and cracked on with a bottle of Ca'di Ponti 2010 Sicilian Catarratto, (a steal at 15.35 for the bottle or 3.85 a glass) which was light, fruity and easy to drink - perfect for our 2.5 hour long lunch. The first dish out was a fairly substantial slice of Iberico Pig's Head Terrine, which we both liked with the tender shredded meat and the right amount of salt, pepper and fresh parsley as seasoning. The Mini Iberico and Foie Gras burger arrived medium rare, topped with delicately thin onion rings and was predictably rich and juicy. The foie gras added additional richness to the already succulent Iberico meat but was difficult to distinguish as an individual element in the burger. Courgette flowers were stuffed with a ripe goat cheese, served lightly fried and drizzled with honey. Tasty, not too oily and and a pretty satisfactory execution of the classic Roman dish. Jam\u00f3n de Teruel arrived thinly sliced and was delightful to snack on in between our more substantial plates. Aged for 18 months, the meat was lighter and less rich than the Iberico, but still had a hint of nuttiness. The Gnocchi Gratin with Trompettes and Tallegio was one of our favorite dishes - mainly for the superb gnocchi. As such, I'd order one of the other gnocchi dishes next time in the hopes of getting more than the measly four in the gratin! Grilled Salt Cod with Arroz Negro was pleasant and the firm texture of the fish with its crispy Romesco crust worked well with the softness and slight brininess of the rice. As the arroz negro had quite a strong flavor, the red pepper emulsion surrounding the rice fell a bit flat and we were lost as to the reason for its presence on the plate. Patatas fritas were poorly seasoned and disappointing, further let down by what could have potentially saved the dish - a bland bravas sauce with no kick to it. Flavor-wise, our favorite dish of the evening were the skewers of Salt Marsh Lamb Leg and Kidney with Smoked Paprika - one of the three Pinchos Morunos from the grill. The lamb and kidneys were tender, with a wonderful smoky char to them and despite my general aversion to kidneys, I found the texture of these to be quite pleasant. While the flavour of the lamb was wonderful, we were slightly put off to find that our meat was cooked rare - and very rare, at that. The neighboring table was also unhappy with the rareness of their skewers and sent them back to the kitchen. Perhaps the temperature of the grill needs to be adjusted? A few minutes later, we received a skewer on the house (in other words, the order had been put in 2x) and the lamb was much less remarkable this second time round. It would appear that the dish had been sitting out for some time, evidenced by the small pool that had gathered around the board. Echoing our sentiments on the lamb skewer, our Iberico Pressa was served slightly too rare for our liking. It was tasty in its lemon and caper sauce, properly sliced to preserve its tenderness but I still feel slightly uncomfortable about eating pork that's more than pink. We finished the meal with a pleasant Panacotta with Clementine Sorbet and a pair of very, very strong filter coffees. We enjoyed our meal at Opera Tavern and with 50% off, the bill came to 57 pounds for 2 at lunch. Not sure if we'd return for a full-fledged dinner and both agreed that paying full-price for the small portions on offer is just not worth it. But its convenient Covent Garden location makes it the perfect place to enjoy a few small plates and wine pre- or post-theatre downstairs in the livelier and less formal bar. There were more hits than misses, and the hits were certainly delightful, so next time we think we'll stick to the hams and dishes from the grill.",

    "text": "We visited the Opera Tavern for the second time last Friday night on a bit of a whim hoping that we would be able to get a couple of stools at the bar (no reservations downstairs). We turned up just after 7.30pm and the gods were with us as we managed to bag the two last remaining seats right in the corner of the bar. It turned out that this was possibly the most perfect spot; intimate but with a great view of the bustling room. I actually preferred sitting at the bar to the more formal dining room upstairs \u00a0more atmosphere and a chance to chat with the very friendly and informative bar staff. We were thirsty and hungry in equal measure so we ordered a couple of beers, nothing special on offer on the beer front unfortunately, chargrilled bread with olive oil and some stunningly good nocellara de belice olives to keep us going while we tried to decide on how to put our meal together. There is plenty of good stuff to choose from on the menu which is divided into bar snacks, from the charcoal grill, hams, charcuterie, cheese and tapas sections. We decided we were in for the long haul rather than a quick snack so we started with a couple of dishes from fish tapas selection: a very tasty crispy soft shell crab and an amazingly good Cornish bass ceviche with shaved asparagus, basil sorbet, radish and sea purslane. If you are looking for a recommendation on what to eat go for the bass ceviche every time as it is a truly wonderful taste sensation. It's probably just a personal groove that we have got into but staggering the ordering of dishes seems to work best for us and avoids a whole heap of dishes turning up at the same time which you then struggle to get through. So in this spirit I ordered a solitary mini Ib\u00e9rico pork and foie gras burger from the charcoal grill selection. I had this burger on my previous visit when I thought it was good but not outstanding \u00a0however, on this occasion it a complete revelation. Perfectly cooked, beautifully presented and packing the most sublime flavour this was a mini burger to die for!! By this point in the evening we had really hit our stride and after a bit of breather, and a glass or two of the Molino Loco Macabeo, we went at the menu one more time. The chargrilled leeks and spring onion with a crispy duck egg and romesco was pretty damn good, the confit of pork belly with cannellini beans was probably the best I have ever tasted while the roasted duck with borlotti beans, cabbage, fennel salami and pomegranate was fine but possibly suffered from being in the presence of so many other outstanding dishes. The bar was thinning out by now and after a quick look at the dessert menu we both decided that enough was as good as feast. We had just enough time to grab a quick cortado and a glass of the very fine Jerez brandy before paying the bill and rushing to get the last train home. Not a cheap evening out but with top notch cooking, beautiful presentation and lovely service this was one bill we that we were more than happy to pay.",

    "text": "The Salt Yard Group have outdone themselves here. Never did I think their eponymous restaurant on Mortimer Street could be bettered, but it has been in my opinion.I really couldn't have asked for more from the food, atmosphere, or staff at the Opera Tavern. My lady and I popped in early for a drink and some nibbles before our reservation, and were treated with smiling, attentive-but-non-invasive hospitality from the off. Having not been able to find any record of my res - almost certainly my fault knowing my own record! - they were able to find a table for us with no issue on one of their busiest nights of the year, being the 14th of Feb. To top it all, our drinks and food up to that point - whitebait-style baby sand eels and a foie gras terrine - were comped by the front of house. A good start...The wine list was comprehensive and mostly Ibero-Italo centric, complimenting the food very nicely. The Opera Tavern distinguishes itself from its sister restaurants Dehesa and the Salt Yard with its charcoal grill - we tried several of the pinchos, the venison and the Iberico pork in particular being succulent, supremely tender and well-seasoned. Scallops were also very nicely done, having spent what must've been no more than 10 seconds a side on the grill and were accompanied by Morcilla de Burgos (Spanish blood sausage) and a gently-sweet artichoke pur\u00e9e.The now famed Ib\u00e9rico pork and foie gras burger/'slider' made an obligatory appearance too, its recognition well-deserved with a small-but-perfectly-formed juicy little patty creating a miniature taste sensation. \"Waiter - I'll have five more, please...\".Completing our meal were the courgette flowers stuffed with a (nicely mature) goats' cheese - which helped cut through the hyper sweet honey drizzled over them - and the selection of three Manchegos with quince.All-in-all, I couldn't recommend this place enough. The only thing that could possibly knock half-a star of the place was - per the sweet tooth of the table - the dessert menu which was deemed \"overly complex\". However since we didn't try any of them it's hardly fair to comment!That'll have to wait til next time...",

    "text": "I had an amazing lunch at Opera Tavern. I paid for it through the nose though and all other orifices. Truly not a place to go if you are looking to fill your empty stomach with food but being a tapas place I'd go there for wine and good company while having a few small bites on the side. Asking the waiter for wine recommendation was a brilliant move as he brought a lovely wine which I am beating myself up over for not remembering. Overall the service was excellent and prompt. Hard to tell though as there weren't that many other people there that day. As hard as it seems to get a table in the evening as easy it is to get one for lunch on a weekday. The place was basically deserted at 13.00 on a Wednesday. First thing to order was of course the mini Iberico pork and foie gras burger after all the raving reviews. It is not the kind of thing I'd get going for tapas. It's not the easiest thing to share, but after tasting it I can't image that you would want to. Such a tiny little succulent thing packed with flavour. At over \u00a35 for a single burger I'd still happily get one every time I go there. In fact, the waiter was saying that the night before a couple got 6 each. The salt marsh lamb leg with pumpkin gnocchi, salted anchovies, brown butter and mint was another lovely dish full of flavour, though a bit on the small side. Gratin of gnocchi, taleggio, trompettes and migas was chosen as the token veggie dish and was of a pretty good size, could easily have shared this with more than one other person as it became a bit rich towards the end. One of the other highlights that I would definitely order again - apart from the bread that was very tasty with a slight grilled flavour to it - was the crispy squid and sea purslane with chilli aioli. The squid was the proper quality one, not chewing gum kind. Crispy and light batter surrounding melt in your mouth squid with an aioli with the right amount of bit to it. The letdown of the meal I have to say was the confit of old spot pork belly with rosemary scented cannellini beans. It felt a bit bland, didn't really do anything for me at all. It also came in a pretty small portion. I can really imagine coming back here to have some wine and 2 - 3 dishes to share among a few people but I wouldn't come back if I am looking for food.",

The food was underwhelming at best.We didn't have an issue getting a table without reservations at 730pm on a Friday night, which was a bit surprising. The atmosphere is comfortable, and the bartenders were very friendly and helpful. Neither of us were very hungry, so we went for the jamon croquettas, monkfish with mussels broth, a platter of Iberico chorizo, and the classic tortilla. The chorizo was tasty and flavourful which is expected from Iberico pigs. The croquettas were fine, but I found the mushy texture combined with the lack of ham inside a bit disappointing. The monkfish lacked seasoning, and the mussels were acceptable. The best dish was probably the classic tortilla, but even then I wasn't blown-away. To be honest, I probably wouldn't come back. Best tapas in the city is still Barrafina in my opinion.",

I am especially fond of this restaurant as the bill clearly states, optional service charge and the price is stated if you don't want to pay the service charge. There's also \u00a31 donation to charity for every bill. It all states in the menu & that the service charge goes to all staff equally. I would recommend this place.",

Pork and foie gras burger - Absolutely amazing. \u00a0Wish they made a bigger one!Courgettes stuffed with goats cheese and drizzled with honey - Decadent but overpriced as you pay for each one.Lamb with mint and anchovies - Incredibly tasty and anchovies are not fishy at all.Mozzarella with basil oil - Amazing.Grilled bread with oil starter - Nothin to call home about and I'm not a fan of paying for bread.Patatas Frites - Quite yummy and come with good sauces.Shortrib with polenta - OKTuna - DisappointingOnglettes skewer - OK",

    "text": "We visited the Opera Tavern for the second time lastFriday night on a bit of a whim hoping that we would be able to get a couple of stools at the bar (no reservations downstairs). We turned up just after 7.30pm and the gods were with us as we managed to bag the two last remaining seats right in the corner of the bar. It turned out that this was possibly the most perfect spot; intimate but with a great view of the bustling room. I actually preferred sitting at the bar to the more formal dining room upstairs - more atmosphere and a chance to chat with the very friendly and informative bar staff.We were thirsty and hungry in equal measure so we ordered a couple of beers, nothing special on offer on the beer front unfortunately, chargrilled bread with olive oil and some stunningly good nocellara de belice olives to keep us going while we tried to decide on how to put our meal together.There is plenty of good stuff to choose from on the menu which is divided into \"bar snacks, from the charcoal grill, hams, charcuterie, cheese and tapas\" sections.We decided we were in for the long haul rather than a quick snack so we started with a couple of dishes from fish tapas selection: a very tasty crispy soft shell crab and an amazingly good Cornish bass ceviche with shaved asparagus, basil sorbet, radish and sea purslane. If you are looking for a recommendation on what to eat go for the bass ceviche every time as it is a truly wonderful taste sensation.It's probably just a personal groove that we have got into but staggering the ordering of dishes seems to work best for us and avoids a whole heap of dishes turning up at the same time which you then struggle to get through. So in this spirit I ordered a solitary mini Ib\u00e9rico pork and foie gras burger from the charcoal grill selection. I had this burger on my previous visit when I thought it was good but not outstanding - however, on this occasion it a complete revelation. Perfectly cooked, beautifully presented and packing the most sublime flavour this was a mini burger to die for!!By this point in the evening we had really hit our stride and after a bit of breather, and a glass or two of the Molino Loco Macabeo,we went at the menu one more time. The chargrilled leeks and spring onion with a crispy duck egg and romesco was pretty damn good, the confit of pork belly with cannellini beans was probably the best I have ever tasted while the roasted duck with borlotti beans, cabbage, fennel salami and pomegranate was fine but possibly suffered from being in the presence of so many other outstanding dishes.The bar was thinning out by now and after a quick look at the dessert menu we both decided that enough was as good as feast.We had just enough time to grab a quick cortado and a glass of the very fine Jerez brandy before paying the bill and rushing to get the last train home.Not a cheap evening out but with top notch cooking, beautiful presentation and lovely service this was one bill we that we were more than happy to pay.",

    "text": "Sliders (or mini burgers) seemed to be one of the buzz words of 2011. Everyone was serving them, but only a few managed to serve them well. Opera Tavern, located in London's Covent Garden is one of these. Their iberico pork foie gras sliders hit all the right notes. The iberico pork is served medium rare, and the addition of the shaved foie gras gives it that extra juiciness. Topped with melted aged manchego cheese, and a garlicky aoili and home-made onion jam below, this little gem is definitely the star of the show. The crispy Iberico pigs ears, San Daniele ham, and Truffle Pecorino cheese were also the ideal accompaniment to a nice big glass of Rioja.

We decided to go before the opera rather than after, so we were there very early and were pleased with the noise level (nonexistent). \u00a0The room filled up while we were there, but the noise level remained low. \u00a0We ordered several starter dishes (olives, nuts, anchovies...), followed by three dishes each plus a wonderful bread. \u00a0Everything was delicious. \u00a0I especially liked the papas fritas and the stuffed zucchini flowers. \u00a0We were taking our time, so we were able to savor everything, including desserts and a couple of bottles of a lovely Cote de Rhone. \u00a0I think that this place is a great discovery and I expect to revisit it on my next trip to London.",

The bill came to about \u00a3170. Had fois gras terrine. Octopus. Whiting. Scallops. Etc etc. Cheese plate at the end. Loadsa wine and a kick ass brandy from Spain FYI the bottle was actually designed by the great Salvador Dali himself. The thing I liked the most about the meal was the cool tunes they played and often I was caught out Shazaming the hits. No need.

Perfectly grilled and flavored.Roasted Tiger Prawns with Piquillo and Prawns Bisque, Grilled Sourdough and Lardo: decent flavor, though I found the sourdough soaked in the bisque a little strange and couldn't get the full sourdough flavor. Spanish or Italian Mixed Olives: so many olives, so much happiness.Padron Peppers: nice and sweet, easy to pop into your mouth.Jamon and Manchego Croquetas: just the right amount of cheesy and it didn't feel too oily, even though I'm sure it was.Spanish Selection of Cheese: beautiful cheese board with delicious flavors.Courgette Flower Stuffed with Monte Enebro Goats' Cheese and Drizzled with Honey: some nice flavors, but the tempura felt heavy and wasn't crispy.Patatas Fritas with Aioli and Bravas Sauce: yum! These were dangerously addicting.Classic Tortilla: pretty sizable portion. They do it runny here and it was a solid, simple tortilla.Super cute spot with nice service.

    "text": "When my parents were in town last week they took me to the Opera Tavern for a tapas meal. I love the concept of tapas, being a greedy pig it appeals to be able to try a little of everything! We were seated in the upstairs dining room, which has more room for large parties (we were a group of 6). Downstairs there is a bar you can sit at and some smaller tables.We started off with smoked almonds and fried peppers - eating these is a little like Russian roulette - about one in ten is a hot one! We also got the flatbread with rosemary butter. The menu is split into platters for charcuterie and cheese, items from the grill, including the fabulous foie gras burger and then other plates split into meat, fish and vegetables (including salads). You are meant to order 2/3 plates each and share, but when the scallop is literally one scallop it's a little difficult to share it between three!After some umming and ahhing we finally ordered a selection of charcuterie and small plates across the meat/fish/vegetable spread, this included heritage tomato salad with Parmesan cream, the Spanish charcuterie board, Cornish crab with samphire, chargrilled octopus with chickpea fritter & mojo verde.Everything was really tasty - I had to fight people off to get photos! Everything from the recommended foie gras burger to the salads was beautifully prepared and flavoured. Eaten but not seen above were lamb chops, mini burger with foie gras, pork belly, chargrilled quail, courgette flowers and a roasted beetroot salad (description doesn't do it justice!)With the meal we drank Albari\u00f1o and beer (depending on people's taste). When it came to dessert all the desserts were paired with a sweet wine, sherry or port. So of course I had to try.... The chocolate fondant with salted caramel (to die for!) and expresso ice cream - this was paired with a glass of sherry.We left the meal stuffed and happy, but was it value for money? Well my parents didn't think so - they are used to spending an equivalent amount on a more traditional meal with three courses, and for me it was a lot to spend on a meal even with the traditional format and half bottle of wine each. However it was a great experience and if the larger 'main' plates had been more competitively priced at around \u00a37 or those single scallop/courgette flowers were actually plates you could share, it would have felt better value.Would I be back? Possibly! But I may have a better strategy to attack the menu - their group deals at \u00a335/\u00a340 a head seem good value.",

    "text": "I find the name of Opera Tavern a little bit misleading; I feel like it suggests Italian cuisine, when it's really a tapas place. That said, it's run by the same people who run Salt Yard and Ember Yard, two better known tapas place around London, and I had this one recommended by a friend. I came with a friend on a weekday evening at 8:30 PM, having made the reservation just two days before. There were a few empty chairs at the bar, and an open table or two, so it may well have been possible to walk in. We had a cute table on the first floor, and I thought it was quite nice, but I could have easily been very happy at the bar too.We asked the waitress for some recommendations off the menu, and she rattled off at least 8, of which we ordered 5 (they suggest 2-3 plates per person). From the bar snacks section on the first page, we went for the Morcilla scotch egg and the Iberico pork and foie gras burger. The first was described to us as being known as \"the best Scotch egg in London,\" and it did not disappoint. The yolk was beautifully runny, and it came with a tangy chutney. The pork and foie gras burger was equally impressive. I couldn't figure out how exactly foie gras fit into the equation, and we decided that it must be mixed in with the patty when it is shaped. The patty was served pink, and though I thought the top bun made it a bit unwieldy, when we went without it, it was a good two bites each.For the tapas, we got the Iberico presa, the crab croquettes, and the chargrilled octopus. I thought the crab croquettes were the best, and something really unique that you don't see often on the menu. We got four of them, and the aioli totally hit the spot. The Iberico presa had five thin slices of meat, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the tomato based sauce that came with it (this reminded me a bit of the Iberian pork ribs at Barrafina, but the latter was infinitely more satisfying). The chargrilled octopus was also ok, but nothing to write home about. I can rather confidently say that I've had better. They were served with an interesting round cake that I didn't quite think was a chickpea fritter, as described.Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Opera Tavern. Some dishes were better than others, but all of it was good quality food in a nice restaurant that is extremely well located.",

I'm so glad she did!We were sat upstairs in the restaurant, which was attractive and sophisticated. We weren't quite sure how to go about ordering but ended up going for two rounds, one from one side and the menu and the next from the other. I suspect this isn't necessarily how it should be done, but it's pretty flexible. The pork skewers I had were divine. Perfectly flavoured with paprika and cumin, I could have ordered them again and again, were that not against the spirit of the thing. The rest of my group were all waxing lyrical about the foie gras burgers - they could not praise them enough. Other highlights were the flatbread (I know, but it was real tasty) and the confit pork belly. We ended up way over-ordering. Everything is pretty rich and intense. I think it could be quite/very expensive, but if you resist too much temptation, you probably don't need that much to make a very satisfying meal.",

Next came the Morcilla Scotch egg, which had a beautiful texture on the inside and out. \u00a0The egg was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the Morcilla around it.Next came the Grilled Ib\u00e9rico Presa with Capers, Shallots and Lemon. \u00a0If we had never tried Iberico pork leading up to Opera Tavern, this would have registered as a 10/10. \u00a0However, I think we both felt that this dish fell just short of the two dishes we had back home. \u00a0But that doesn't mean that we wouldn't recommend this dish either. \u00a0Definitely a must-try item if you've never had the pleasure of eating it.Finally, one of the main reasons we came here - the Mini Ib\u00e9rico Pork and Foie Gras Burger. \u00a0As some of you may (or may not know), foie gras has been outlawed in San Francisco (but if you REALLY had to have it, there are places to go). \u00a0These tasty little morsels were sliders out of heaven. \u00a0The pork was juicy and was garnished with onions, cheese, and a perfectly crisp bun. \u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend that you try this if you find yourself at Opera Tavern.We passed on dessert, and the recommendation of 2-3 dishes per person is definitely spot on. \u00a0You might come in with the presumption that because Opera Tavern is so close to the theaters that it'd be a horrible rip off. \u00a0But having had some delicious tapas here, I genuinely would disagree with you. \u00a0Definitely look into here if you're around the area!",

    "text": "Fun little upstairs tapas bar in Covent Garden close to and around the corner from the Royal Opera House, run by the same talented tapas crew as London's Salt Yard.Nice service experience. \u00a0Recommend getting a bottle of wine (this is a tapas restaurant, after all) We ordered up about 5 dishes for two including: grilled octopus (tasty, but too small), papas fritas, pork loin, mini burger with foie (slightly overdone meat on the burger, but nice sauce) and their sweet potato tapas dish. \u00a0Your meal will come with grilled bread and small, grilled mild, green, charred Spanish peppers. Very tasty accompaniments. (BTW, if you want more bread, you will have to ask for it, as it will not be offered. My only real ding on this place. This is a tapas restaurant, after all, and bread should be easier to come by.)Nice Covent Garden ambiance, although somewhat of a dated dining room with lots of 90s burgundy and black. \u00a0Afterwards, walk around the Apple Market for a late night Covent Garden feel. Wondering outloud if Gwyneth Paltrow named her daughter after a Victorian night market in Covent Garden in her throws of London amore?",

    "text": "Wow, I think I just had the two best desserts ever!But let me start with the over all experience.First of all, tapas means small as in SMALL dishes, not main course size, nor American size. Second, they add 12.5% SERVICE TAX, like MANY other restaurants do, don't be an a** about it. This is Europe.We were two sharing 7 dishes (skipped the flatbread which we regret). We had burgers, chorizo, crab, iberico loin, patata fritta and courette flower. Everything was delicious except for the iberico loin which didn't taste much more than rosemary. Even the patata fritta , which was simply fries/chips with some seasoning, was super! Mini burgers - you need to have one per person, it is so good!Then there was dessert....omg! First the strawberries with pistaschio meringue and strawberry sorbet and then cold chocolate fondant with salted caramel sauce an espresso icecream. I cannot decide which one was the best. One thing for sure, I wish they would have the concept for desserts as for the rest of the food. Imagine not having to choooooose dessert, but to just have all of them! Small tasting desserts would have done it for me!Our waitress Amy was the best! She recommended the wine that was perfect, when we couldn't decide on red or white. She is the kind of waitress you always wish for! If you don't make reservations, be here when they at open at 17.00 to get a table.They accept AMEX.",

The service staff was very friendly and food came out quickly, except the meat dishes my friend ordered. One more reason to avoid meat in my opinion! I had the Padron peppers, Spanish cheese tasting, crab croquettes and the friend courgettes. All were very good. The patatas bravas were not very authentic but good still. I would recommend it to you as a loud, happening spot with nice, not cheap tapas;)",

    "text": "Went over here for a dinner with a friend. I give it only 3 stars, but with a heavy heart. The service was truly excellent - great waitress, great food and wine recommendations. The ambiance was nice enough - you can have semi-private conversations if you're on a date, and if you're in a group, it's not stuffy where you can't laugh or talk loudly. The food was really generally excellent as well. Then why the 3? The portions.Now, I'm not (just) an ignorant guy from America talking. There was just one dish that really annoyed me. It was a scallop something or the other. The dish itself tasted superb, but it was tiny. How tiny? 1 small scallop tiny. Not even a mouthful! It really bugged me. And I'm taking it out on Opera. Sorry.And I thought the lamb was a bit underdone, but I've been told I'm a philistine for even suggesting that, so we'll let that be.The scotch eggs (that I didn't have) looked fantastic. I'd probably go here again to give it another shot. But not order the scallop.",

Morcilla is a Spanish black pudding and worked beatifully with the creamy egg yolk and crispy coating.I highly recommend the Chargrilled Octopus with Chickpea Fritter, Red Pepper and Mojo Verde (\u00a38.75) and the Sea Bass Ceviche with Shaved Cucumber, Basil Sorbet, Radish and Sea Purslane (\u00a37.75). The octopus dish was beautifully balanced and the ceviche was incredibly refreshing and zingy.We had a Mini Ib\u00e9rico Pork and Foie Gras Burger (\u00a36.50), which was very good - I wish they did a full size version! The Charcoal Grilled Lamb Loin Chop with Aubergine, Shallot, Roasted Garlic and Mint Dressing (\u00a37.00) was perfectly cooked and was full of flavour.The Confit of Old Spot Pork Belly with Rosemary Scented Cannellini Beans (\u00a37.25) and the Courgette Flowers Stuffed with Goats' Cheese and Drizzled with Honey (\u00a37.95) were both a bit of a let down for me. The cannellini beans were too bland and the pork, while well cooked didn't have enough to carry the beans. The courgette dish had too much honey making it feel more like a dessert!",

Well, it isn't, but it's one of the things they happen to do really well. The fois gras burger is what gluttonous dreams are made of. We also had some campari champagne cocktails, cahrcuterie for days and some chat with fellow bar-seated dining enthusiasts who were going through the menu as well. You can't really make any bad decisions here, unless you've decided to go to a chain tapas place down the road instead but then if you're reading this, hopefully you've already had enough sense not to think about that other place and come here instead.",

    "text": "Part of the successful Salt Yard group, Opera Tavern is a Spanish restaurant in Covent Garden specialising in Tapas. Spreading across two floors with a wine bar downstairs and restaurant seating space on the top floor. The signature Courgette Flower Stuffed with Goats' Cheese with honey has a lovely crisp texture and a well balanced flavours of sweet and savoury notes. Ib\u00e9rico Pork and Foie Gras Burger for me is a winning formula, the richness of the Foie Gras works so well with the oily and nutty profile of the pork meat. Not the cheapest Spanish restaurant however, as most items ranged between \u00a38 to \u00a310, you would most likely needing to get at least 4 dishes per person to be full.",

    "text": "It's an old Covent Garden boozer, converted into a clever, classy little tapas bar. Split over two floors, bar stools predominate the converted pub downstairs, small table informality and big (slightly drafty) windows balance an open glass wine wall in the space up the small staircase. From the team behind one of my favourite restaurants in London, Dehesa and older brother Salt Yard, it's fair to say that the opening of the Opera Tavern had me salivating slightly.  The strong wine list mirrors the focus at sister restaurant Dehesa. Much of the menu appears to come from their older siblings too. The focus on solid Spanish swine is happily reprised. (Slightly sloppily carved) Jamon Iberico de Bellota is excellent. Salty and sweet with a nutty marbling of divine fat daring your heart to complain. Heads of deep fried courgette flower come next, stuffed with sticky goat's cheese and drizzled with honey. Mini Iberico pork and foie gras burgers fall apart without their skewer, the devil's own canap\u00e9. Rich little bundles popping with flavour, they feel a little out of place here, slightly too refined and worked, but unbelievably tasty non the less. This also applied to the (thankfully grease free) 'Italian style' Scotch Eggs. A clever take on the dish, soft cooked eggs lightly rolled in a spiced pork blanket served with garlicky aoli, it just felt slightly wrong in a tapas bar. The one bum note of the night came with a totally tasteless Short Rib of Beef served with over-cooked polenta and over-salted cavalo nero. Shame that. The gnocchi, taleggio cheese and mushroom gratin made up for this side step in the quality of the food. A perfect counterpoint to the meaty dishes served alongside.We finish our savories with the full set of three different pinchos morunos, squat charcoal grilled skewers, a little pricy at \u00a33 a pop, but stickily well cooked. The Salt Marsh Lamb Leg with smoked paprika stands out as a favourite of the three, cooked to pink perfection within a charred carapace. Pannacotta with a tooth-tinglingly tangy tangerine granita was the least lardy of the puds but even that nearly finished me off. I wouldn't have had it, but our waiter was so insistent we try it. A great example of its kind, with creamy vanilla texture and biscuity swirls to give a contrast. Miss Jones had one of the interesting sheep's milk cheeses from the list, perfectly acceptable finishers to the meal.",
