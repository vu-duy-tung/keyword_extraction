It's also a place that does nice Congee (Chinese porridge) if you fancy something light and not too heavy. Water Dumplings with noodles is not bad too... This is a great place for after clubbing too if you fancy some food as they open until around 4am. But be warned that you may have to queue depending on how busy it is since there are not many restaurants around the west end that open until 4am. It's a place I used to go to in my clubbing days..",

I like their congee (excellent as a alcohol mopper-upper) and veggies, but have somehow never tried their (now) titular crispy duck. The menu is quite big, with a few more random dishes that you may not find outside of a Chinatown. My standard general fall-back in Chinatown if I don't want something specific or fancy - a good all-round chinese restaurant.",

Unfortunately most places weren't that busy and had mostly white clientele! We dived into the Crispy Duck cos it looked small and like it had been there for ages. It wasn't that busy but it seemed like they wanted us out almost immediately - within literally 2 minutes of sitting down 3 different staff asked if we were ready to order - I felt like I was in the Wong Kei! We specifically asked for the soup before the duck, but we got the duck first and the soup joined it one second later, so we had to eat our soup and leave the duck to go cold - it was very annoying. Hot and sour soup wasn't in the least bit spicy and was tepid. The duck was cold and greasy and not very flavoursome - and the cucumber and spring onion to put in the roll were really dry, like they'd been left out all day. Sweet and sour pork did what it said on the tin but the pork with salted vegetables didn't really taste of anything - not even salt and was a bit slimey. Egg fried rice was luke warm and greasy. They add on service to the bill (which is written in chinese script so you can't even check it's accurate) and for over \u00a345 it made me even more determined never to go here again. Although they do have chinese beer on tap.",

    "text": "Every time I go clubbing in the West End, this is the place I end it. The restaurant goes on after 3am to fill late goers' and clubber's tummies. It is very busy during the evenings and particularly after late hours because customers are no longer sober. Drinking alcohol only makes you hungrier, so this place is perfect place for fatty, cheap, and filling food. Chinese food has its reputation for being greasy and unhealthy with the amount of oil and chemicals that the Chinese use on them, which is why this place receives a lot of attention. This place has up to four floors and large tables that can serve eight people, and if you have more people, the waiters will help you put together another table. However, during these drunkard hours, customers can get nasty and on these occasions there will never be a clean fight. I've seen waiters shout at customers and chuck them out, which is all entertaining for your drunkard state. You can talk as loud as you want and eat as much as you want, which ensures that you'll enjoy the rest of your night. The price ranges from \u00a35, which is very cheap, yet I was sad at 4am once when they stopped serving lychee. This place is not plush and not sophisticated. The Chinese food here is basic, but does well for 3am on a Saturday night, so I'd definitely recommend it. Yet, if you want Chinese delicacy then look elsewhere because that's not what the Crispy Duck restaurant excels at.",

By comparison, the 'Crispy Duck' provided a great range of dim sum and main dishes. During my visit I had my usual, which was the Cantonese roast duck, pork buns and prawn dumplings. All of these dishes were very authentic. The only con is that the restaurant is so far away from where I live! But if your in the area this is one of best places for Cantonese roast duck. You may find that many \u00a0people highly recommend the Aromatic Crispy Duck. However I don't - as I don't like how the duck is deep fried. Furthermore you also miss out on the lovely flavors Cantonese duck has to offer. In other words it just tastes deep fried! Try the Cantonese Roast duck for change.Overall I give this restaurant 5 stars! This was mainly because of its excellent food. However, I would also like to note that the service needs a little improvement in relation to the the waiters manner and behavior - i.e. they seem very grumpy. Overall you can't give this restaurant a miss!",

I decided to apply my internationally patented rule of \"go where the queue is the longest\" in choosing the Crispy Duck last weekend and was happily rewarded with some of the tastiest food I've had in a long time. Generally, my rule is foolproof - the more people waiting, the better the place will be, and the Crispy Duck was no exception. Though of course there was a bit of a wait, the woman at the front was cheerful and quick and we were seated in exactly five minutes, just as she had predicted. After pondering over the extensive menu, I decided to go with crispy spring rolls as an appetiser and kung pao chicken with house special fried rice as a main. Wow - I was blown away! The chicken was nice and spicy and packed the punch that I was looking for, and I couldn't get enough of the amazing rice with its bits of prawns, pork and egg mixed together in a perfect blend of flavors. The best part of the whole visit - not only was it fantastically delicious, but I got out of there paying only \u00a315 or so for my huge feast and a beer. I've read the other reviews saying that the Crispy Duck is open until 4am which just means that I'll be back on my next traipse through the area, even late at night!",

    "text": "You kids have got it all wrong! Despite the name, this place is much better utilised as a dim sum joint. Duck is too expensive, even in more modestly priced outlets such as this one, so I recommend tucking into the little 'hearty parcels' instead (well done to anyone who got the small Cantonese joke there). Dim Sum finishes around 3pm(ish) so get there for lunch and be prepared to crawl home because your legs won't work after stuffing yourself for no more than a tenner. The menu (with pictures) ranges from steamed dishes such as the staple Shaomai, to fried dishes including some excellent calamari. Personal favourites of mine are the Scallop dumplings and the pork cheung fun (mmm slimey). Be prepared to queue on a weekend as it can get very busy. Also, has anyone else noticed that there seem to be an infinite number of floors to this building?",

These guys are open till 4am and they love the slightly tipsy super-nice drunkards that come in to enjoy a meal. Whether you're in during the day or the ungodly hours of the morning the waiters are always nice and happy to share the fun. The food is great, we all share a pot of Chinese tea and whether you order your old favourite or something new off the menu its bound to impress. The best part is the prices are quite decent - in a group you'll walk out paying between \u00a310-15 depending on how hungry you are, we always share a few things like get our main but then share some steamed veggies - you do have to try and be good no matter what time of day! Keep up the great work Crispy Duck, I'll be in soon!",

I hadn't been to Asia at that point... actually I'm a little embarrassed to admit it but I hadn't eve tried Chinese food at that point (my parents are Irish and do not eat out. Ever). So I hadn't tried it. Until that fateful day...Crispy Duck breaks a newcomer into the ways of Chinese food easily, with their tasty and varied range of treats. I'm not sure if I ordered their Turnip Cake or their Chicken-with-Cashew-Nuts that day. But rest assured I have ordered it many times since.Crispy Duck ; you'll always be my first experience of Chinese food (albeit Anglicised Chinese food, like the rest of your China Town neighbours). And to you I will always return. Great service, fair prices, quality food, spacious atmosphere ; you offer everything I want in a Chinese restaurant.",

The Oversea Chinese restaurant has been around for decades as a common and affordable place for dim sum, a satisfactory sit-down meal or indeed somewhere where you can have a quick meal to yourself and not feel awkward about it. So it is nice to have around even though it now no longer offers student or elderly discount. Nevertheless whilst the quality of the restaurant and its food is on the right side of average it is still not that remarkable. Like a safe bet and a familiar sight, this restaurant is nice to have around for an everday type of dining experience but not good enough to be a treat.",

The window was filled with crispy duck that looked super inviting, so we headed in. I was feeling a little delicate admitted a stressful move, so plumped for a less adventurous option which is unusual for me, but I struggle massively with odd textures if I feel a little off, so I decided to avoid the frogs legs, bitter melon and pig organ. There's a huge choice in the menu, we sat on the second floor, the decor is plain, and the staff were friendly, though occasionally a little stand offish. For what you received, it seemed rather overpriced, which I wasn't entirely impressed by. My chap's dish was fantastic, he went for one of the hotpot dishes with yam, reasonable portion and filling, but I was a little disappointed with mine. I ordered the noodle soup with crispy duck and crispy belly pork. My order arrived, and it was ten minutes before my partner's came to the table. The crispy belly pork was fantastic, but the duck for all but two pieces, was chunks of fat on bone. I understand that duck is fatty, but when it's something proudly displayed in the window, I do expect more than a quarter of my meat to be meat. Because of this, it did take a while to eat, and I'm self conscious enough as it is without waiters hovering behind me to take my plate on the last mouthful. If you go, go with a full wallet, don't get the duck and know you'll be paying 2.60 for a can of \"not to be sold separately\" pop- you will probably lovely time on knowing that!",

However, we did not receive nearly that amount worth of food. In fact we were not even remotely full when we left the restaurant. To make matters worse the service was absolutely horrible. It took them 90 minutes to get us all our food. They kept coming out and telling us it was coming to keep us there but it took way too long. When it finally came it was lukewarm and mediocre tasting, not to mention the tiny portions. When I asked the waiter for chop sticks he told me \"no, I'm too busy.\" Also, we asked for tea and they tried to charge us \u00a35 for it when every other table, which were full of Chinese speakers, got the tea for free.

A quick Yelp search brought me here, and the first red flag should have been we were seated immediately even though every other open restaurant in the near vicinity had a line out the door.We sat on the second floor, and our table was filthy with grains of dried rice and stains under the thin piece of paper they put on top of the tables. Service was also incredibly slow, as the 3 waiters working the second floor had too many tables to juggle and every table was getting frustrated.Now I normally don't mind a hole-in-the-wall restaurant with non-existent service if the food is delicious. I got a 2-meat platter with char siu and roast duck, stir-fried Chinese vegetable with bean curd and chilis (came without any bean curd, but service was so slow we cut our losses) and egg fried rice.

The duck was just crispy enough and the plum sauce was sweet and complemented the crispness of the duck. Any sweeter and it would have been too much. After the duck we were served our mixed veggies, sweet and sour pork, and king prawns in black bean sauce. Yum, yum, yum is all I got.

    "text": "Selecting a restaurant in China Town is always a little hit and miss. Just wanting a small bite before catching the train home to Brighton, we were perusing the menu when a friendly Chinese girl popped out in to the cold to encourage us in. I appreciated the fact that we had chance to review the menu before we got harassed!We were shown to a table by the window on the first floor. The clientele included a good mix of Chinese diners, usually a good sign.We decided to order the mixed h'orderves for two followed by half a crispy duck, washed down with a couple of tsing tao (a little on the pricy side seeing as I watched the waiter pouring the beer directly out of a can!)The h'orderves were a bit hit and miss, mostly tasting if they had been hanging around for a while. The spring rolls were hot and fresh but the seaweed was soft and tepid, the chicken and ribs a little tough and chewy and the prawn toast was just average.The duck was a good sized portion, and tasty if a little dry, and the pancakes a little floury.That said, the staff were very friendly, and were happy to provide my boyfriend with the hottest sauce available on request.We didn't try any of the main dishes so I unfortunately can't comment on these, and although not a terrible experience, I've definitely had better meals \u00a0in China TownThey do sneak a hidden service charge on to the bill as well, so do check for this before paying.",
