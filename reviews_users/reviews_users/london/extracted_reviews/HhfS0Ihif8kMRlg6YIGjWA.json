Unsurprisingly, the few places not completely full didn't have space for all of us. We hesitated over khans for a minute or two because it was half empty, but hunger took us in. It was a good choice - the service was friendly and fast and the food good if not excellent and the price reasonable. In particular, bearing in mind what others have said, there was plenty of variety and depth in the flavours, and heat in the appropriate dishes. It filled up pretty quickly after we sat down and we would definitely go back.",

    "text": "I hate writing negative reviews when the service is good but I have to say something. When you have reviews from non Indians complaining about how bland the food is at an Indian restaurant, pay attention. I wish I had checked yelp before eating here and partaking in one of the worst meals I had in London. At first I tried to excuse it and said maybe it's made for the palate of Londoners or people who don't know Indian food, but then I checked the reviews here and I saw a general consensus. Alarm bells should have gone off when I ordered chicken biryani and the waiter suggested I order a curry sauce to go with it because the biryani is \"very dry.\" What? Since when does biryani need curry sauce on it. I let it go because I've seen some Bengali friends put curry on their biryani. When I got my food and tasted it, I realized that to the waiter \"very dry\" apparently means bland and tasteless. No kidding, it tasted like plain rice. My mother got chicken tikka masala and even this hard to screw up dish tasted terrible. Seriously, the first time I tried making chicken tikka masala, it tasted better than theirs. We found a spicy flavorful chutney on the table, that we just dumped on everything to improve the flavor because we were starving and not many places were open. The waiters even noticed we didn't like the food and kept asking if everything was okay. I'm sorry, they were really nice and the service was good, but the food was tragic. The only thing that actually tasted good was the garlic naan. Please please invest in a copy of Madhur Jaffery's Indian Cooking or any of Julie Sahni's recipe books. If someone tried Indian food here for the first time, they'd probably never eat it again. That makes me sad.",

The fact there was no music was odd, it was a QUIET lunch.Service: just one server and he was friendly and accommodating of the fact we were in a bit of a rush. Food came out quickly, this may be because we ordered items that wouldn't take a while.Food: -- Samosas were good.-- Avocado shrimp was terrible - avoid this appetizer.-- Rice was a bit dry.-- Daal had good flavor but was watery.-- Okra was a bit bitter but wasn't greasy, which is a plus.-- Papadums were tasty (note these aren't complimentary!)Overall: Khan's was just okay...we won't be returning.",

    "text": "Do NOT go here unless you want terrible service. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Food was average and service was atrocious. The waiter was incredibly rude and problematic. He first off got the orders wrong and then refused to admit he got the orders wrong and that it was our fault for not getting the correct order. He then was very confrontational when answering questions about the check and did not want to give us a receipt. Each person also MUST buy a \"main dish\" here in order to avoid a \u00a315 minimum charge per person. Apparently two appetizers don't qualify as a \"main dish\" but a \u00a33 side salad does. There also is a 10% service charge already billed, regardless of how many people in your party, so the waiters can guarantee themselves a tip even though they are rude and bad at their jobs. Overall horrific experience and a complete waste of money.",

And the best part \u00a0was the friendly and attentive service. I highly recommend!",

The staff is amazingly helpful and being vegetarian there was plenty of options. The mushroom masala is to die for the mushrooms are seasoned perfect and if you get the garlic naan bread you'll be able to dip it and enjoy all the flavorful sauces. It's great for a date night or a night out with friends which we were there for and the host was so hospitable and everyone checked on it. Bottles of wines are perfectly prices especially compared to the neighborhood so you can enjoy a bottle of wine with your meal. It's a must stop in for traditional Indian food in London",

Last straw was clearly there was 3 tables open. Waiter asked how many? I said 1. Indian Lady behind me said 4 people. And he turned me away and said there's no table for you. Not sure if it was because I am not Indian? Or because they didn't want to waste a table on me. Or both.",

More relevantly, the completely misheard our order and left off significant amounts of food. When we asked where the rest of it was, they told us that we had everything; when we clarified, they then reversed course, lied, and claimed it was on its way. Needless to say, they had to cook it from scratch, making my wife wait for her food for a full twenty minutes after I had already finished mine.The food itself was mediocre. The chicken korma was bland with stringy meat; the vegetable curry was over spiced; and the masala mushrooms were boring. The rice and naan were good, at least, but they weren't a meal by themselves.Will not return, recommend avoiding.",

The servers are very helpful and attentive and our kids (13 and 15) loved the food. We highly recommend Khan and enjoying the neighborhood.",

The portions were generous, the service was quick and friendly, and the flavors... mmmmmmm the flavors were awesome!Also worth noting that we went in as two babies and three adults, much to the dismay of other diners! \u00a0But the manager took the opposite approach and welcomed us with open arms. \u00a0We chatted and he sized us up and pretty much ordered on our behalf, and he couldn't have done a better job. \u00a0And when I said it wasn't spicy enough, he took the challenge to heart and brought me exactly what I needed!Will definitely be going back before I head home.",

It's location right across the street from our South Kensington hotel is what got us through the door the first time, but the food and service is what got us back in a second time. If you love Indian food this is a great place to eat. All your Indian favorites can be found on the menu. The only down side is that the restaurant is fairly small, so if it is a busy night, or you have a larger group you may want to make reservations.",
