Forget that place up in Kingsland Waste that gets all the plaudits, the guys at The Golden know exactly what they're doing although the lovely boss says that he's been in the business for 30 years and is still learning. Anywhere that can take an order for half a dozen teas at totally different strengths and gets them all spot on gets my thumbs up - and my mates' too. Everything is freshly and perfectly fried, the portions are huge, and the service fantastically friendly. They'll do batter thick or thin to your liking, or grill your fish instead. Whatever you prefer the guys will do their best to accommodate, nothing is too much trouble. The home-made salad is amazing, full of garlic, chilli and herbs and is the only thing to have with the scampi. Room to eat inside or out, plus it's licensed so if you don't want the lovely tea there's wine or beer to be had instead. The only trouble is if you're off to the GDA dance cabaret afterwards you're going to be too full to join in. But it's worth every mouthful.",

    "text": "So traveling on business and only my second trip to London ever. \u00a0 A few of us were in Greenwich area and being in London, wanted to get some fish and chips. \u00a0 Several choices in the area so we pulled up trip advisor and Yelp and this seemed to be the place with the best reviews. We arrived and started second guessing ourselves as this was a small joint with seating for 12. \u00a0Mostly built for carryout and we wanted to do a sit down dinner somewhere a little nicer, but since we were there, we decided to try it out. \u00a0What a good decision. The owner (Chris) was behind the counter and heard us talking so engaged us and couldn't have been nicer. \u00a0 He recommended that we try the Haddock and Cod, and why argue with the owner. Both were delicious but the Cod was some of the best fried fish I have ever had. \u00a0 Chris even came over to talk to us. \u00a0He had been doing this for 40 years and you can tell he has a passion for it. \u00a0 He talked about how excited he got every morning when the fresh fish arrived and the satisfaction he gets hearing people compliment his food. \u00a0 I have had fish and chips that cost 3 times what this did that wasn't half as good. Tender fish in a batter that was cooked just right All I will say is if you are in the area and looking for fish and chips, this is the place to go. \u00a0Make sure you strike up a conversation. With Chris too as he is as genuine as they get. \u00a0I suggest you order the large as",

Mouthwatering fish (the haddock beats the cod!), mountains of chips (traditional vinegar of course!) just right salty salad. Don't bypass the curry sauce or onion rings--both are awesome. Daughter gave two thumbs up to the fried chicken, too. Absolutely perfect!",

Everyone was so friendly and the haddock fish n chips were AMAZING!! I can see why this place was rated a 5, and I will be visiting again before I head back to the states! Thank y'all so much! :)",

As someone else stated you do get a jar of tartar sauce with your fish which is nice, but a homemade sauce would probably tasted better. The batter was fine but nothing special. \u00a0The fish also did not taste fresh. \u00a0It had a very overly fishy taste to it. \u00a0The only part I actually enjoyed was the fries.Just so anyone who does not like skin on their fish, THERE IS SKIN ON THE FISH!!!!! \u00a0 Do not order the Haddock if you don't like skin. \u00a0As someone who doesn't care for the skin it was very off putting. \u00a0I can't speak to the other types of fish having skin but I know the Haddock does. Don't get me wrong, I am not knocking off stars for the skin as some places make it that way and I'm sure many people enjoy it. \u00a0I just was not impressed by the food and not making the fish fresh along with the fries. Service was fine and the gentlemen who wanted on us was very nice. \u00a0No complaints regarding service.",

We all ordered fish and chips, I ordered the haddock and my friends got the cod. Everything is cooked fresh and you can taste it! Crispy, flakey, moist and perfect fish. The chips were think cut and tasty. The salad is refreshing and they put Thai basil in it which gives it a unique flavor. They bring each table a jar of tartar sauce, ketchup and mayo. There's vinegar and salt and pepper at the table. Great experience. The owner is very charming and friendly! They also have chicken nuggets, meat pies, fried chicken, jacked potatoes, and sausages. Great array of comfort food. This place isn't fancy, just solid GOOD food. Definitely go!",

    "text": "After our day trip to Greenwich to see the requisite tourist attractions, we had worked up quite an appetite! Walking uphill to see the prime meridian will do that to you! Well, The Golden Chippy hit the spot perfectly. The Yelp reviews don't lie; they know how to do their fish! They have both takeaway (which we opted for ) and dine in options. Prices are great - \u00a36.50 for a large cod, 7 for a large haddock, 3 for large fries, and \u00a31 each for coleslaw and sweet corn, as well as mushy peas and other sides. The star wasn't the fish - the haddock was the best fish and chips I've ever had. Batter was not too crispy or soggy, and fish was flaky but moist. Cod was solid too, as were the chips. Coleslaw with sweet corn was great and vinegary. \u00a0I've had better mushy peas, these were on the plain side. Service was pleasant and prompt, our order took 8-10 minutes to cook. It's worth the 15 minute walk from the Cutty Sark, and even closer if you take the train to Greenwich station. Take some to go and eat a picnic by the pier waiting for your boat to come in!",

    "text": "This was my first fish and chip experience in London and I highly recommend Golden Chippy! We found this restaurant on yelp and it had 60 - 5 star reviews, which is unheard of! You can choose from a number of different \"line-caught\" fish and either have it fried or grilled. I had the fried haddock and chips with mushy green peas and a cheese and onion pasty. My friend had grilled halibut and chips with fried garlic mushrooms and my other friend had fried halibut and chips with corn and a Jamaican patty pasty. At the end of the night, the owner and chef gave us amazing baklava bites! Check out my photos!",

Coming from the north of England where good fish and chips are on every street corner, I must say these fish and chips are as good as any I have tasted. Good atmosphere and seems to be very popular with Americans. Would absolutely eat here again.",

We found it from a list of the best restaurants for a classic English meal and i'm glad we did.. The price points are fair and the food is truly delicious. We tried two different kinds of fish and minced pies, loaded potatoes, mashy P's, and it was all great. It's a tiny location but they are fast and clean. Their tartar sauce was amazing. The only thing I wouldn't order next time would be the rolls. Other than that, even the side salad's were amazing and flavorful. I can't wait to come back next time in London.",

    "text": "Jet lagged Americans coming through. Ok ok. We were not that obnoxious. Hubs and I are from the states, Los Angeles to be precise. We were staying at the Hilton a block away and turned to Yelp for a local spot to eat. We had just arrived in London and were starving and exhausted. Luckily the Golden Chippy was only a block away. Hubs and I had no idea how London food scenes work. Do we order at the counter, sit down and wait to be served? I'm sure we confused the heck out of the workers. Being as tired as I was, my hubs told me to take a seat outside and he would order for us. After that hump was gone over, everything worked out smoothly. Our breaded cod and chips were on point. \u00a0I was so happy that everything tasted fresh and delicious. Server brought out tartare sauce, ketchup and mayo. Yum!Being an American, I could not understand a word any of the workers/servers told us. At that point, a large Spanish family arrived and the server switched to Spanish. And I understood everything. Next time solamente voy a hablar en espa\u00f1ol porque haci nos vamos a entender mejor. TLDR: great local spot for fish and chips.",
