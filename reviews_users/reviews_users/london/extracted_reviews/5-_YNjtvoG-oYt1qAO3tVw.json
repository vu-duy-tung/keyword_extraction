    "text": "The curiously named Bugis Street Brasserie is a Cantonese Singaporean bistro and is part of the Millennium Gloucester Hotel with the entrance on the corner of the building opposite the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. The interior is OK, with a slightly odd mixture of modern and old: empty gilded bird-cages hang over the bar, the tables are marble, the floor is tiled and the chairs are old-fashioned and wooden. The service was disappointing: I was met and seated quickly, but it was then ages before they took my order for food or drink. The menu is a mixture of Chinese (Cantonese) and Singaporean food and sounded nice. I ordered Salt & Pepper ribs (\u00a35.25), followed by crispy duck. Curiously rather than arriving in that order, and separately, they arrived in the opposite order and separated by about one minute. The ribs were small, and very strongly flavoured. Lots of garlic, both crushed and thinly sliced, plus crushed and sliced chillies dominated the flavour of the dish, perhaps too strongly for some but I did enjoy it. I was glad that I was on my own that evening because I suspect my breath could probably have stopped traffic at 50 yards! The crispy duck (\u00a39.50) was very good: there is something about the theatre of making up the pancake, sauce, duck, cucumber and spring onion mixture that I always enjoy. For the main meal I went for fried noodle with chicken (\u00a36.50) and sizzling beef (\u00a39.50). Once again the food was highly flavoured, but could perhaps benefit from being more subtle. I washed it down with a couple of bottles of Chinese Tsingtao beer (\u00a33.60). Overall I enjoyed my meal but the service was disappointing, and the food somehow seemed over spiced, which is odd for a Chinese meal. I will go back again sometime, and it will be interesting to see if my opinion of it changes.",

I have had most of the Singaporean/Malaysian dishes excluding those that contain pork and not once have I been disappointed with the food. Personal favorites are Nasi Lemak (love the deep fried anchovies and the curry chicken is sumptuous), great Mee Goreng, Chicken Kung Po and just love the Laksi soup to keep me warm on a cold day! It's great that they provide Adobo type nuts as a complimentary during the dinner menu. Finally for those with a sweet tooth the Gula Melaka Sago Pudding makes for a great ending. Very nice. Prices are reasonable and makes value for money. Great service most of the time. Go check it out!",

Could of been a little stickier to use with chop sticks. The roast duck was tasty, great taste and very moist. Loved it. Sweet and sour pork was also tasty with a variety of veggies. Stir fry duck also was good. I particularly liked the mushroom and chicken with bamboo shoots. The sauce was light in flavour and the chicken again was moist. I would recommend this to anyone. Most meals are \u00a37-\u00a313. None of the meals come with rice. This is added on if you want it. \u00a33 for white rice and up to \u00a37 for fried varieties.",

On my first trip to London with my parents, we saw a poster advertising the restaurant in the lift of a Tube station (probably Kensington). We're originally from Singapore but haven't lived there for many years. One common refrain you'll here from people in our situation is how much we miss the food. so any chance we get to try a Singaporean/Malaysian restaurant, we pounce on it.The dishes we ordered were good, and authentic. There were some not-so-authentic-looking dishes on the menu, so you kind of have to know what to order. We tried one of two other Singaporean places that trip, and this was the best. The experience was a little more refined due to being in a hotel, and he prices were marked up accordingly. If you're in the area, I say this is a good place to go for a Singaporean food fix, and even to go back to. If London is your oyster, there are other places that give you better value for money (C&R for the Singaporean/Malaysian/other Asian mix; Satay House for strictly Malaysian cuisine). After all, Singaporean food is street food and hawker centers, not haute couture.",

The decor is a little on the functional side (echoing the Singaporean hawker stalls) and the atmosphere makes this restaurant a good place to get a good quality meal fairly fast, rather than a place where you might pass a few hours. The food is prepared to a high standard and served in good-sized portions with a varied menu that includes most chinese restaurant favourites with a few more exotic Malay dishes. Having been here quite a few times I have found the service can vary from friendly and welcoming to slightly surly, although that would not put me off going back as the food has never disappointed. Note that there are good value weekday lunches, and an excellent Sunday lunch buffet that was about \u00a38 per person last time I went. Also, take-away orders get a 10% discount (and don't have to take a gamble with the service!).",

    "text": "Found this restaurant while hunting for Singapore food in London on Yelp. This restaurant is at the corner of the Millennium and Copthorne hotel and about 5 minutes walk from Gloucester Station. The restaurant is fairly spacious and seats about 50 persons. In the restaurant, there are large pictures of historic Bugis Street hawker stalls and there were a number of round marble-topped ('kopitiam') tables which gave the restaurant a feeling of authenticity.I ordered the Singapore laksa, chicken rice and grass jelly drink. The laksa was particularly wonderful - the noodles were the correct 'thick vermicelli' noodle from Singapore, there was the appropriate sliced fish cake, dried tofu and shrimp and the gravy had the right quantity of coconut milk and spice. It was as authentic a Nonya/Katong Laksa as I have tasted outside of Singapore. The chicken rice was not bad - chicken was tender, rice was flavorful and soup tasted authentic but the version at C&R in London's Chinatown is better at a lower price. Finally, the grass jelly drink was beautiful - 1 sip and I was transported back to when I was drinking this drink in a Singapore hawker center when I was growing up. All in all - well worth a visit, especially for the Singapore Laksa!",

The Fish Sambal and Veggie Fried rice were spot on. The Sambal was made with Tilapia and had the right amount of spices to make it flavorful without being too fiery. The husband also got a small portion of the Crispy duck that was served with cucumber, spring onions, pancakes & hoi-sin sauce. He found the duck to be a little chewy and dry, but liked the pancakes. The prices are very reasonable, between 9-13 GBP for each dish and portions are generous. The service was quick and efficient.**Update:We went back again for a quick lunch and the Ah-sam prawns were unbelievably good. A fiery red curry it tasted amazing with plain white rice. We also got a side of schwezan okras and they were crunch and tasty. Over all a stellar meal.",
