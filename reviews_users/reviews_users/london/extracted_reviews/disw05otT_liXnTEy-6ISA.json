    "text": "UPLIFTINGLast evening, I found myself at my last evening of a week-long vacation from those personal and professional responsibilities lurking back in California. The prospect of the next day's eleven-hour flight home to the daily treadmill was almost enough to make me weep; the experience promised to be akin to traveling to ones own execution. But, for the moment, I was still in my favorite city in the whole world - London - and I was out for a last meal, so to speak.Close by the hotel and off Earl's Court Road, I came upon the Orjowan restaurant subtitled as \"Fine Lebanese Cuisine.\" The establishment's name, as well as the names of the dishes on the menu, suggested more than just a little Turkish influence. But who was I to quibble over the food's provenance? I was simply looking for an uplift from imminent depression through food.My dinner selection was called \"Kafta Yoghurtliyeh\", and revealed itself to be thumb-sized chunks of minced-then-grilled lamb in a thick yogurt sauce with pine nuts over which were sprinkled thumbnail-sized chips of toasted pita bread. This dish, spooned over rice and accompanied by a salad of lettuce and sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes and bell peppers tossed in a vinegar and oil dressing, and all washed down with a Lebanese beer, was a delicious and immensely satisfying end to a cherished week spent selfishly only on myself. And the meal cost about $30.The staff was attentive and dedicated, though they were hardly being taxed as, the hour being early for dinner for most (5:30 PM), I was the only customer. I trust the place would fill-up later as the ambience, menu and presentation were too attractive to permit otherwise.Perhaps I'm being hasty to award 5 stars after only one visit, but the meal was faultless and I'm unlikely to get back to visit the place again to try other dishes.I'm currently pecking this out at 34,000 feet over the mid-Atlantic. There are about 8.5 hours of the flight to go. Just shoot me now.",

Hunger drove us across the road to this 'unassuming' rather quiet Lebanese restaurant. Greeted and seated we decided on boned chicken and lamb, both char grilled and served with rice and salad. Sides of homous, olives and a yoghurt and cucumber salad. And fresh carrot juice. Chicken was delicious, perfectly cooked. Lamb was nice, slightly over cooked. Humous was very authentic with lots of tahini. The olives were plenty but not great. The atmosphere was quiet bordering on a vibe of business is not what is should be. The bill included service. Not something I like. Tipping is a optional comment for the punter. If you add it to the bill then it's just the price and it should be in the price of food on the menu. All this said things where just OK until I visited the toilets.The toilets were really poor. It a restaurant with a good degree of effort put into its decor the toilets looked third rate. And you cannot get away with dirty, tatty toilets in a restaurant. Not good!",

Between the appetizers and main meal we were asked to move tables to accommodate a party of 14. While we graciously accommodated, we did expect a little something in return. Only after complaining at the end of the meal about a mandatory service charge that the waitress indicated did not go to her, the service charge was removed and we were offered a few token baklava just before we stepped out. Drinks took long to arrive and had to repeatedly ask for water. The reason this restaurant gets three stars is because the food is exceptional.",

Luckily we had inside info about this one, and were taken there by a pilot who makes it a point to stop here whenever he stops over in London. Very quiet and unassuming, so don't go here if you want hustle and bustle. However, you quickly forget about others (and everything else for that matter), once you start eating. WOW! Fast service, fresh tasting, I love lebanese and this stuff is good!!! I highly highly recommend the Farrouj Meshwi (half a boneless marinated chicken, charcoal grilled)...beautifully seasoned, so tender, incredible. Accompanied with great basmati rice. My friends had the lamb which they also raved about. Hummous is so fresh, dolma is amazing...some great baklava to finish off the meal. Highly highly recommended, can't wait to go back.",

I loved the look of the place - pure Beirut bakery, with small shopfront, view to oven, and a few tables. Menu was as expected - zaatar (thyme), cheese, lahme bajaeen (meat). Prices were not Beirut, of course, but cheap for London. I was disappointed that they were not open for breakfast (manousheh should be eaten in the morning), but when in London.... \u00a0Truth be told, the product was average, but I'm comparing it with Beirut or Amman, so not really fair. Looks like they were serving authentic Turkish coffee, which I didn't manage to try.",

Gladly the place didn't disappoint us ; the staff were very welcoming & friendly. They had taken our orders quickly and promptly. the place was quite small with only very few people & it didn't have any wi fi.We ordered one Taboula *which is the traditional Lebanese Salad* it came out very tasty. Then we ordered mixed grills * consisting from small pieces of mixed lamb and chicken and bread on the side* along with chicken Shaorma *which is also a very famous tasty shredded grilled chicken dish* that also came out with bread along with some garlic sauce and mayo. Luckily none of these dishes came out too oily or too dry , their meet & chicken texture was just right. For the drinks their menu was very limited & a bit disappointing, it only had fresh juices along with softdrinks but with no cocktails that would have been a great add to their tasty food. Their prices were very reasonable & it would be a good experience especially for those who are not very familiar with the middle eastern cuisine; that would be a great introduction for them. & Since Im very used to the middle eastern cuisine both the labanese and the persian i would give it 6/10.Cheers!",

It was slightly drizzling and there weren't many people (I think we were the only people), and the restaurant has a nice, quiet atmosphere. The waitress was pleasant and helped us choose from the menu, which was definitely needed since there was so much we wanted to order (we did still order way too much in the end...)The spicy potato appetizer was delicious! I got the chicken shawarma which was also fantastic--it was way too much food for me though, the portions are pretty sizable. Though definitely better than paying more for less. I also really like the bread, which was warm and has a really nice texture.I also have to give a thumbs-up to the lamb, which my friend got - I usually extremely dislike mutton, but it doesn't taste like mutton (??) at all. It was delicious and I would now actually consider ordering that dish when/if I go back to London. Definitely a hidden gem and would recommend to anyone visiting nearby!",

    "text": "Heard London had great Lebanese cuisine, found this place through the Yelp app. Location is nicely decorated, white table cloths but a casual feel. Server made some recommendations to share a bunch of mezze and split a grill plate. They really pushed the wine here and seemed to have a good selection.We were directed toward standard choices like hummus, baba, and falafel but, being familiar with the cuisine, chose to try the labneh, sojok (homemade sausages), and arayes (filled with lamb and onion), which were all good. The babaghanouj, mountain salad, and halloumi were also pretty decent but less interesting. The grill plate added onto that (with lamb, shish taouk, and kafta) was just the right amount to share and we left stuffed. Pricing was fair for the amount received. Food was more generally Mediterranean than specifically Lebanese.",

I had the hot mezze, hummus with lamb and mixed nuts which was good but I've tasted better hummus (had the consistency of mashed potato) Followed by the mixed grill which was great, the lamb and chicken were cooked to perfection and everyone else loved their meal as well. We sat for a while afterwards chatting and laughing and there was no rush to pay the bill and clear out.I am torn between the prices being a bit on the pricey side and being fair, I think the hummus starter was expensive for what it was and the drinks were ranging from \u00a32.50-\u00a33.50 for soft drinks/water and fruit juices. It was a great dinner and would definitely pay them a visit again.",

The veg options are spectacular and the falafel is just so delicious that we could make a meal out of it alone - (well maybe along with their freshly baked pita!)As an example of the professionalism of the staff, at the next table was a rude loud classless American complaining about her fake gluten allergy and why wasn't she told about ingredients, etc. \u00a0Well, why not ask, silly woman? \u00a0In any event the staff handled her with calmness and grace. \u00a0I felt embarrassed about the antics of my countryman. Lastly, make sure you get here. \u00a0You will NOT be disappointed! And don't miss their baklava! WOW!",
