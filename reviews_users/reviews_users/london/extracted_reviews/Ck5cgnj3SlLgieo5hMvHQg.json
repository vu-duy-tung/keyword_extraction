My partner and I were in London for a few days and visited a variety of restaurants over a period of seven days. And we're really disheartened with the quality of service at most restaurants in London. However, this was the first restaurant, where we were asked more than once on how he food was and manager even stopped by. I would rather spend my money where the customer service is good or not eat out at all. And Giraffe definitely did not disappoint us with its service!",

    "text": "I went here with my boyfriend at about 3 pm on a Friday. It wasn't busy, the food came out quickly, and they had a decent amount of vegetarian options. We chose the bruschetta bites, delux falafel burger, and phod malay noodles. For a \u00a310 burger, I'm glad it was as good as it was. Not dry, plenty of toppings, and the choice of sweet potato fries, rather than the regular. My boyfriend ordered the malay noodles, which were too spicy for me.. But he seemed to enjoy them and said the flavor reminded him of samosas. The bruschetta was yummy, although a little wet and cold by the time we returned to our hotel (as expected). Lots of toppings though, which was great.I noticed another review saying they were upset that it wasn't a specific type of cuisine served, but that was honestly my favorite part. We were able to get asian noodles, Italian bruschetta, and a burger in one location.. It's like a delicious, vegetarian sampler!Overall, there were great vegetarian choices, and we would be happy to return!",

My fella ordered the chicken kiev and an apple cider. All the food was fantastic and filling, the drinks were sublime. First time trying Rekorderlig Cider, but it's addictive! My noodles were very light and flavorful. A great summer dish. My fella's chicken kiev was lightly battered and had just the right seasoning and sauce. Definitely a thumbs up for the food!I definitely recommend this place for a light dinner or drinks before a show or after work. YUM.",

Luckily, our party of 3 was seated right away.I chose the steak sandwich that came with fries, and my sandwich was delicious. The bread was nice and toasty, the steak was a nice medium well, and the blend of arugula and mayo was perfect. The sandwich also came with caramelized onions, but my dislike for any type of onion had me scraping it off right away.My companions both ordered the chicken schnitzel that came with an arugula salad and either mashed potatoes or fries. The chicken was breaded and flavored with garlic butter. It was good, but a little too buttery for my liking. We ordered 2 different desserts: the chocolate mousse crunch and the apple and cherry crumble. I LOVED the chocolate mouse crunch! It was rich while still being light and airy. The crumble was also good, but the apple and cherry portions weren't as flavorful as I expected. The crumble on top was delicious. It wasn't your run of the mill crumble made of flour, butter, and sugar. This had oats, raisins, slivered almonds, and hazelnuts. I would give this place a 5 star for food, but since the service was so slow, I'm giving them a 4 overall.",

    "text": "Giraffe is a chain restaurant that can't seem to really decide what type of cuisine it would like to offer. To start with, the name suggests absolutely nothing about the cuisine. An English word, a long necked animal. Your guess is as good as mine.I've only ever eaten at a Giraffe twice; once in Heathrow Airport with my parents and the other time at this one here. Neither have been particularly pleasant experiences. The menu offers things from fish and chips, to BBQ ribs, to an asian inspired duck salad. Again, what cuisine is this? I ordered the BBQ ribs, as did my friend Maria and my friend Oscar had the Haddock and chips. It was meh. I didn't finish my ribs as they were incredibly sweet, the sauce was verging on caramel-y, and it was so filling. My main qualm about this branch is the staff. They were rude, dismissive, quite clearly not interested in serving you, and had to ask multiple questions about things we ordered after we'd ordered them. They also, in a chain restaurant selling painfully mediocre quality food, added the 12.5% service charge to the bill. I won't even begin to describe the look of anger and disgust on our waitress's face when we asked if she could take the service charge off. I'd advise you head elsewhere.",

We were immediately greeted from across the restaurant by the bartender, and a server (Chris, I believe) sat us and cheerfully took our drink orders. We spent a few minutes looking over the menu, at which point an Eastern European woman marched over and asked us what we wanted to drink. We let her know someone had already taken our order, at which point she left without a word. After our drinks came, she returned to take our food order (clearly Chris has been covering her section of tables, as she had been nowhere to be seen until asking about drinks). Our food arrived in a reasonable time, and our waitress once again disappeared completely. She did not return to check on us or get us more drinks, except to offer dessert and clear our plates about 10 minutes after we had finished. Once we declined dessert, we were completely ignored, and had to flag down the bartender for the check. A word of warning, there was an included \"optional\" gratuity of 12.5%. Food was okay at best, service was awful.",

    "text": "Well we stuck to Wilton Rd for dinner this week and that's how we found Giraffe. Their menu is very diverse so it's great to have such different options. I ordered a plain burger with avocado. I notice they don't ask you how you want it cooked in London but since I like well done, I was fine. My daughter, the medium rare eater, not so much. Only thing I found about my burger was the avocado wasn't ready yet. As someone who eats A LOt of avocado this one wasn't ripe yet. I'm surprised they were able to cut it. My son got the taco tapas and he liked them. My daughter liked her burger. And hubby said his enchiladas were fine. Service was excellent!!! And finished with the churros that were so yummy! Good finish to the end of a long day all over London.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in here shortly after 12:00 pm yesterday for lunch quite hungry when we arrived in London. We had eaten at their location st Heathrow and enjoyed it, and were encouraged by the reviews left fellow Yelpers. Alas, we received very inconsistent service. It was a bad start when we sat in a nearly empty restaurant and the waitress came up to us and said after 10 minutes, did you order? I told her that we hadn't even seen menus. She gave us only the breakfast menus. I didn't want breakfast and should have asked if they had a larger menu. I noticed other people were eating other food. I don't know why I was so bashful. Probably was tired from a very long trip and had been awake due to an early morning flight. We each placed our order. When placing mine, we informed our server of my allergies. She said no problem - that the entree didn't have that but she would inform the kitchen. Our plates were our places in front of us and I began eating. Suddenly, one of the waitresses (there was a steady rotation of people at our table rather than someone who was assigned) pulled my plate away saying \"Wait! Hold on. I have to check something with the kitchen\". My plate was removed and returned to the kitchen. I was told that the corn cakes had potatoes, something to which I am allergic. I had eaten half of one. They said they would make me ones without (they didn't) Five minutes later my plate was returned without the corn cakes and by then the eggs were cold. Had I known that, I would have ordered something else. Again, I wish I was given the full menu. One of the waitresses apologized and comped the dish. Overall, it was a bad experience. I did experience some physical discomfort from having eaten the offending corn cake. For one, I think the staff needs to have better knowledge of the menu. Secondly, I think that they need to have people assigned to tables. It was way to chaotic. There also seems to be an absence of training overall.",

It's a chain, but still has a lot of character all on its own. We were eating pretty late, and this was one of the few decent-looking places still open for dinner. They have a pretty good deal where you can get a starter and a main for under \u00a3I0, though the choices are limited. I wasn't feeling any of those and had the rump steak sandwich with chips instead. The steak sandwich was huge! Even though I was starving, I only managed to finish a tasty half. Our waitress was really friendly and our food arrived promptly, so even though they automatically put a service charge on the bill, I didn't mind so much (I guesssss).",

For families: it has a good children's menu with healthy choices (fresh juices/fruit cups), and not so healthy (items smothered in chocolate chips). We tried a variety of items from the menu including the huevos rancheros, and pancakes. First, the pancakes: the stack is huge (3 large pancakes), and if you opt for a filling (bananas, blueberries or the like), you get smothered cakes! Second: huevos rancheros, we didn't have high standards since we are quite far from the originating culture, but the whole dish was cold (including the eggs). We didn't wait long for food, so we can only assume they were only heated slightly per normal serving. Had the eggs been hot, plus the great sides within the burrito, and copious hot salsa = it would still be far from true Mexican authentic, yet it was fine given the cost.",
