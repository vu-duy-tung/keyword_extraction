But none of those frilly factors trump good food for a fair price and attentive service - none of which were present in our recent dining experience. After receiving our two pint-sized main dishes, we decided to call it a night and asked for the bill. 10 minutes later we asked again. 10 minutes later we asked again. 10 minutes later we stood up... just stood up, put our coats on and waited for our server to bring us the bill. 45 minutes after finishing our meals and asking for the bill we walked out, flanked on both sides by a line snaking out the door. Go for it. Enjoy. Sorry for taking up those seats for so long.",

My friend got the duck curry and I got the pad thai, because I heard the pad thai is the best thing on their menu.If the pad thai really is the best thing i don't know how this restaurant is so packed! I thought the pad thai was awful, granted I lived in San Francisco and have high standards, but even at a bad restaurant in San Francisco the pad thai is better than here! and the curry looked more like a broth than actual curry! I would not recommend this place! They also don't have any deserts on their menu!",

Maybe I am just greedy but I was left feeling that it wasn't quite enough. And for the money we paid it should have been. Perhaps I didn't order well and should give it another go...maybe. There is a lot of competition for lunch in Shoreditch - better than yelo round the corner but not much. Yes it looks great, has a buzzy atmosphere and the food is good - just not somewhere to go if you are really hungry unless you want to run up a king size bill.....",

In San Fran, even the smallest joints have at least a couple hundred reviews...Anyhow, the atmosphere was nice and I like communal eating, but the food was decidedly mediocre. We had:Jungle Curry (not at all what I think of with thai curry... the sauce was thin, like a broth) and was not that spicy, though marked spicy on the menu.Pad Thai (best dish we had here, but still not even near the best I've had)Chicken Satay was fine, nothing special.Chicken and Squash stir fry. Tasty, I liked this one.Considering how trendy this place it, I am surprised people put up with such soso Thai food. Wagamama is much better as far as communal eating chain Asian places go.",

The food is the same as you'd expect in any of the branches (I went straight to the squid and beef with ginger - I've tried a lot of the menu but those are my absolute favourites). I also got to try the monkfish curry, which was tasty, but not my favourite (always too much sauce, but that's handy for roti dipping). The staff were friendly, and we even stuck around for an extra portion of squid at the end of our meal. Yummy yummy yummy. Well worth trekking across London in the snow for. Really. Thing I like about Busaba (aside from the squid) is that you don't feel like you're intruding in someone's space, even with the communal seating. It's busy, but you can still have your own conversation. This branch was quiet, so we didn't feel rushed at all. It's not the kind of place you want to linger in, but you'll come out full, happy, not that much poorer (dinner for two with drinks \u00a340) and maybe even with a takeaway box for another portion of squid.

My squid starter was overcooked and slightly cold by the time it arrived. I'm a big pad thai fan so was hoping this would be an improvement only it wasn't.

Shoreditch usually grits its teeth at chains opening in an area which is largely populated by indies however it seems by the creative launch I attended the day before it's official opening, that this one is welcomed with opening arms. There is something quite cult like about Busaba and its clean fresh wooden interior. They did a very good job of gutting out what used to be Shish (no kebab smells apparent) and the food is fab as per usual. There are (to my knowledge) no other competitors of this standard. Yelo in the square is still a favourite for quick bites. Miso (in my opinion) is awful. Busaba is definitely one for the lunchtime treats - even casual business lunches. I have now visited every branch of Busaba - Bird St being my previous favourite. This one is 30 seconds away from where I work - happy :)",

I went last weekend, some folks came in after me and they were served before me. I was looked at several times and walked by, then finally someone came to me asking me if i was ready to order, my response was \"Yes, i have been waiting\"... the manager came over, i told him that i was sitting for a while before anyone even addressed me, and no apology followed. I think the principle is that, you acknowledge when a customer is feeling as though something was done incorrectly or if they feel overlooked, especially when done INTENTIONALLY. They should consider removing ALL their staff and getting qualified customer service oriented servers and managers, or shutting the restaurant down and doing a full week training. I will NEVER be back to this location. I had to even send my food back because the quality even looked and tasted poorly - maybe the chef was upset.... I asked for the bill and went to the other location in SoHo. I suggest that you do NOT visit this location, and go to SoHo or one of the other locations. You will be better off :).",

Busaba has literally the sweetest pad thai I've ever had. It was filling, but even with the liberal circles of sriracha I felt like I was eating a microwave dinner full of sugar and preservatives. The midpriced \u00a0sake was subpar for the price, it took us two tries to get water after our server decided to go flirt with a chef and have a smoke. As nice as the host was who sat us, it felt like they were more concerned with decor and ambiance and getting you in the door than the food. We should've gone to Brick Lane instead!",

Our service was quick - we had ordered both starters and mains and had out glasses filled with the good stuff within 5 minutes. My only gripe would be all our dishes arrived at the same time - with a table for 2 4 dishes made for tricky logistics! That said everything that was crammed onto our table was delicious. Highlights of Goong Tohd (crispy prawns), Thai Calamari was soft and cooked to perfection with just the right tingle of chilli. Main event of a crispy chicken roti was also pleasant (though we are on the 3rd glass of bubbles by now so my memory is a little 'fizzy!) Once we have scraped our plates cleaned we were not shooed off - infact the opposite. We were allowed to sit, chat and have out glasses topped up until the end of our 2 hour sitting.

Shame. Great marketing maketh not a great company.I also find companies who do not respond to negative social media comments lack the basic foundations of what customer service is all about...! *Cough* Twitter *Cough*Don't get me wrong, I have had delicious meals here, but I have on more than one occasion left feeling underwhelmed and ripped of.

There were fried shrimp in it, which was a tad like eating fish food. The seating took some getting used to, especially for someone there alone, but the food came out quickly and the service was good.",

You can't see me doing it, but just imagine me wearing a cute outfit with my hair haphazardly thrown into a lopsided bun, yawning and shrugging. Anyways, we ended up here the other night because the queue at Pizza East was stupid and we were drunk and needed immediate foodstuffs. We sat down right away. It was described to me as a Wagamama's but with Thai food, and that's a pretty apt description. I think Wagamama's is actually more delicious, and I'm not even a huge fan. The food was instantly forgettable and I wish I had spent my \u00a315 somewhere else. It wasn't BAD, so if you need something to eat, by all means. One person in our party had good food - it was the pumpkin and sweet potato (I think?) curry, and it was really good. I was jealous. Oh, also, the waitress tried to warn me off the jungle chicken, saying it was very spicy. If you like spicy food, you will be totally fine. It was not that hot.",

My favorite Thai dish, tom kha gai, was warm and coconutty but not spicy at all and overly greasy. One of my favorite things about Thai food is all of the flavor without the feeling of being weighed down, and this was the opposite of that. I also had a green papaya salad, another one of my favorites, but again this lacked flavor. If you are looking for kind of watered down Thai adjusted for a western palate, I'd go here, but not for anything close to authentic. (I'm not Thai but lived in Southeast Asia for a couple of years and have been to Thailand a few times, so not an expert by any means but have had some Thai meals that were stupid delicious.)",

We eat thai all over the world, so I feel like we have a pretty good understanding of good/not good :]We split the following: Tom Kha soup, chinese broccoli, vegetable spring rolls, sticky rice and red lamb curry. I have to say - all were outstanding. I can't speak to the noodle dishes, but these were great. They really lost us on the service though. We asked for water & the bill many times and didn't get either until 20 minutes had passed and my fiance finally stood up with the credit card in his hand (side note - we are very patient patrons as we were both servers, so we do anything to keep from being rude to the wait staff). \u00a0 The food I would give 5 stars; the service 2... so we meet in the middle(ish).

The place looks nice, I find the big windows slightly too intrusive as all the pass-byers are too much of a distraction,. It doesn't feel like a quality dining place, it's more of a canteen feel in my opinion. The staff didn't seem to be very willing to help in terms of the menu and options. It's was more of a 'eat and leave' feel. I wasn't impressed. I would definitely not say that the food is that great, though i must also mention that it may be a matter of taste. Also half way through the meal i was having, my stomach had a rather weird reaction to what I was eating, it was bad. Stomach ache and all that... I am very unimpressed with this place. I do hope others will have better experiences there than mine. ps: the restroom is lush. i must give credit to that. the sign on the door for men and women's toilet is great! hehe",

Just there to make their dollar and get out of there.

Aside from that, their basil beef rice plate was good and their veggie spring rolls were edible. Their \"hot\" wings weren't that spicy.

Each table offers a set of spice and sauce in case customers want extra hot and spicy. Yes! Never forget to throw that in so your tongue is burning! I thought my waiter Robert was polite and smiley. Good gesture. They're just so polite there. Even the runner would make sure I sit well to make sure I know he's ready to place the food whenever I'm ready. I ordered prawn chili with rice and water. The portion size was small to medium, enough to keep me energized for the afternoon. The prawn chili was delicious. I recommend this dish if you like seafood. The lunch bill was reasonable. Unlike in NY, most Thai restaurants offer lunch specials so the dish comes with either spring roll or soup or salad. I don't remember seeing lunch menu. I think they have the same menu for dinner too. Funny story... While eating I kept hearing 2 women talking in the background. They spoke Thai. I thought there were 2 employees behind me not doing their job but doing the talking instead. After paying the bill I got up and turned and saw the 2 women sitting at the table enjoying their meals and talking. Language! Why can't I master them all so I know not to assume? Hey! I'm in Thai restaurant. I thought that's funny. Btw I didn't see any Thai employees here. Maybe they work night shift? Whatever the case is I just want to say I had a very good lunch at this place.",

He then said I needed to pay via the app - I thought fine, this is part of the 50% deal. \u00a0On the app itself, you can split the bill - so we did - I paid my third via paypal. \u00a0My two other friends were ready to pay with their physical credit cards however they were not allowed to pay via credit cards - we had to pay via the app! \u00a0I guess that's what the deal said up front @Pay with the Busaba app\" but it did not say \"All parties needs to have the Busaba app downloaded and linked to a credit card/paypal account\". \u00a0Anyway, it was too much of a faff for my friends to download the app and go through the registration process so I just ended up paying their share of the bill.What if my friends didn't want to share their personal info with Busaba but I did already? \u00a0What if they didn't have a smart phone to download the app? \u00a0The offer is not specific enough to state that ALL parties need to pay via the Busaba app. It wasn't even that much money to save - we could have lived without the faff. \u00a0Or next time, just not gone to Busaba as it was just too much overhead to get the discount. \u00a0Really left a bad taste in my mouth leaving the restaurant!",

Yummy drinks yum yum! Lemongrass and ginger press\u00e9 and their coconut water mixes are goooood!Green papaya salad, calamari, morning glory and pad thai jay are on my to-go list! Everything else is also good with alright prices. Portions aren't huge, considering the pricing isn't super expensive anyway.Does get crowded on weekends and even weekday nights.",

    "text": "So let us suppose that you work around Liverpool Street. On a sunny Friday, you decide to explore the area around Shoreditch with your mates to find a place to have lunch. You start at 11:45 and get in a quiet restaurant, so calm and peaceful that you thought you were at a Buddhist temple. But then, by 13:00, the temple turned into a party zone. The place got so full that we had to wait 20 minutes to get our bill. We even cancelled our second order of lemonade as we were tired of waiting. I must say they are probably understaffed at busy times. Apart from that, the food was decent. I will definitely give them a better rating once they decide to hire enough waiters to serve the number of people that come in at lunch time.",

The food was fresh and extremely tasty, try the calamari for a starter and the massaman curry roti with sweet potato fries for a main. Our server was lovely and catered to our needs. However her manager took over our table as she has to go on a break and she was less accommodating. Felt like we were being naughty school kids and were told off for being given an extra glass of prosecco! Aside from her unnecessarily authoritative demeanour overall experience was great!",

    "text": "Went here for a friend's birthday. Great choice of food on the menu. I must say, it is rather daunting to go there by yourself if you've never been before as the menu doesn't give much off by way of help.I had the Tom kha chicken as my main dish. But their side dishes are perfect. They offer a great variety of dishes, which all have their very own distinct flavour. I cannot get enough of the Thai Calamari and the Chicken Satay. Those dishes are a must have when you go.The only bad thing about this place is the fact that they don't take reservations. It is very annoying having to line up outside waiting for a table, especially during the dinner service. But it is definitely worth the wait. Enjoy.N.B.: As they do not take reservations, you might want to get there earlier and be prepared to wait until a table is ready for you. This is especially important when you're with a large group.",
