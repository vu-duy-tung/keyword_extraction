Which is kind of what they are emulating, but then it has to be assessed on that standard. So, in that particular light, it was fine - nothing special. A bit of an unfriendly, unhelpful service vibe. Food was fine, but again, nothing overly creative or different. Tricky to find, too. Charlotte Place is off Charlotte Street, if you are a bit lost.",

I was getting pretty sick of the standard English breakfast and was really happy to find such an inspiring and creative menu that Lantana offers. The maple french toast + bacon + grilled bananas is delicious. Add a poached egg for just 1,50. Their breakfast sandwiches are also delicious. But the star of the show is their toasted banana bread with ricotta. Add a poached egg to it. It reminded me of my favorite brunch places back home in NYC. We went here three times during our visit and we would have gone three more times if we were in town longer.",

When I feel like being hidden in a little back street in Central London, I go to Lantana. The coffee is good and the atmosphere is usually buzzing. However, I have to agree with many of the posters here- the people working there are just not friendly. They all just kind of look like they don't wanna be there and despise you for being a customer. It makes no sense at all. They don't try to make you feel accommodated or welcome. So... three stars from me. Lantana, please change your staff's attitudes towards customers and CUSTOMER SERVICE- or change your staff. There are many good coffee shops in Fitzrovia that manage to have both good coffee and good service (and remember, after all, that you are a BUSINESS serving and competing for CUSTOMERS).",

    "text": "For photos see the Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  At 10am on Saturday morning, I find myself lying belly up on a purple yoga matt pondering (1) what on earth the strange smell is, (2) why the man next to me is emitting whale noises, and (3) how long it will be before I vomit, pass out or run screaming from the room in a frantic panic attack. \"You must not leave the room for 90 minutes\" warns the merciless Bikram yoga Lieutenant Colonel through a hazy 41 degree Celsius fog of B.O., visibly steaming body heat and dripping with sweat underarm hair. As I concentrate on the overwhelming task of breathing, she suggests that I and Libby, my fellow Bikram boot camper, wave to the room to earmark ourselves as the only Bikram first timers, presumably for the sole purpose of letting the others know which ones to watch between downward dogs for entertainment purposes. I emerge 90 minutes and a confronting communal shower later, relieved of 30 kilos of body fluid, with a traffic light red face, poodle hair frizz and a mildly startled/manic gaze, all of which suggests to Libby she best get me quickly to the nearest source of food. Lantana Cafe beckons. Behind Lantana Cafe is the story of a woman from Melbourne on a serious mission: to show the London public that breakfast can offer more than \"the full English\" or eggs florentine, washed down with a mug of workman's tea. As reported in the February 2010 edition of Olive magazine, Sheelagh Ryan quit her job as a policy advisor to an Australian minister, took on waitressing jobs for free on weekends in Melbourne cafes to learn the ropes while waiting for her visa to clear, and eventually found the site in Charlotte Place that now stands home to one of the most popular cafes in London. The La Marzocca espresso machine was promptly installed, and an Australian style brunch menu was put into action. And so it was that Lantana Cafe won Time Out's award for Best New Cafe 2009. Like for all caffeine oriented antipodeans, for me the key to a treasured breakfast haunt is the coffee. I'll go out for a morning coffee then go home to make my own breakfast if I must. Lantana's flat whites rate up there with the best of London's (select few) great coffee shops. What differentiates Lantana from all of them (except perhaps The Providores in Marylebone, the enterprise of 2 New Zealanders) is its typically antipodean style, hearty brunch menu. I can never go past the grilled haloumi, mushroom, sauteed spinach, corn fritter (slightly charred on this occasion), roasted tomato with chunky, wholemeal sourdough toast. The haloumi is never rubbery or tasteless at Lantana. I dined here on Saturday with Libby and Moira who sampled the alluringly runny poached eggs on sourdough. Also popular are the corn fritters, and the baked eggs with chorizo, mushrooms, spinach and spicy tomato sauce served with grilled flatbread and creme fraiche. Or you can keep it simple with toasted sourdough (with Vegemite - hallelujah) or toasted banana bread with date and pecan butter. The only downside - the hideously long Saturday brunch queue. Enjoy. Just save some haloumi for me.",

The lady that got our table and menus and the other guy taking our order were both very nice. One of my friend ordered a Bloody Mary and he said he was going to make it himself because he loved the drink. She said it was very good, so it was a nice touch. One of the flat whites in our order got missing and we had to ask for it again, but apart from that everything went smoothly despite the queue and how crowded was the place.The food was very good as well. Everything in the menu seemed delicious and really tasty, I wanted to try the brioche French toast with vanilla ricotta, but felt like eating something savoury, so I ordered poached eggs on toast with a side of roasted tomatoes. The eggs were perfect, but the toast was a bit too chewy. One of my friends asked it he could have some butter but he never got it (?).Overall, I'd try other places before coming back to Lantana, but this is definitely a good place to have brunch on the weekend if you are willing to queue.",

This fresh, Aussie-style cafe might require a wait but it's worth it, for breakfasts that deliver on flavour and, to some extent, healthiness. Don't let that put you off though: you can still get sausages and bacon and other stuff if the wine flu demands it. Personally I'd go for homemade baked beans, the poached eggs, as much of that unbelievable sour dough bread as you can handle and some cups of exquisite - as you'd expect with an Aussie barista - Monmouth Coffee. It's not cheap per se, but you get what you pay for and a late breakfast here will fuel you til evening. On that basis, I'd say it's good value.

My experience was not really the same.Lizzie got quite a few of us Yelpers here on a not so sunny summer saturday morning for breakfast. We were seated at a table outside.Since we all arrived at different times, we had only ordered coffee initially. They came and asked, a number of times, whether we want to order food ... all the while claiming that there was no hurry ... and this when the place was not full.Finally when our friends arrived and we did decide to order, they were nowhere to be found. During the whole breakfast, just getting hold of someone to ask for something was a difficulty. On one occasion when someone did come, he was visibly displeased with the starbucks cup one of us had (it was empty).The saving grace was the food. It was pretty good. I was quite impressed by the scrambled eggs on toast with black pudding that i had ordered. The chicken and corn was very good ... and so was the coffee (though Larissa wasn't impressed by hers). But the price was a turn-off. I understand that its located in a prime location in central London, but \u00a35 for eggs and one slice of bread is simply not on.Lantana wasn't merely lethargic in serving us, they were the same in accepting their payment. After we had waited for a long time for someone to come and take the cash, we were forced to go inside ourselves and pay up.I would have given them a 2 star if i had been there on a weekday ... but on a leisurely weekend when i was chatting with friends, i wasn't too perturbed by their laziness. So its a 3 star for now ... and so it will stay, as i am unlikely to go back anytime soon.",

Having read many great reviews about this place, I was more than happy to try it, when a colleague suggested it for lunch on Monday. We were seated swiftly - albeit in somewhat uncomfortably - my seat was higher than my companion's meaning I towered over him. Odd when you consider he is almost a foot taller than me! Presented with our menus. Drinks orders taken, followed by food. All OK so far. And that's the end of the good news. We were initially served the wrong orders, then we waited almost 30mins for our sandwiches, after we prompted a waiter. Lunch was OK, but way too pricey for what you get. Upon finishing up, I couldn't get anyone's attention to request the bill. My colleague ended up leaving me to settle up as he had another meeting to run to. Eventually it was chucked onto my table. And it was the wrong bill. I had to go to the counter to get it corrected, having failed, yet again, to attract a waiter's attention. Till service was brusque, as if the mistake was my fault. If you've been there, you'll know how small it is, so there really is no excuse for 'not seeing' your customers. I do appreciate that it was busy, but so are hundreds of other places in London. Sadly I won't be recommending this place to anyone else.",

    "text": "I met up with the Yelp Breakfast Club at Lantana this morning. It's tucked away on a little side street just off Goodge Street in Fitzrovia.We sat outside, hoping to take advantage of some sun peeking through the clouds - it is summer after all, you know!The breakfast menu did look inviting with a mix of good old traditional British fare (black pudding anyone) through to more American style brunch items. As I was planning on an early lunch, I passed on the food and got a freshly squeezed OJ for \u00a33. I did however try bits of other Yelpers' meals, the best of which was some banana bread.What kept this visit to Lantana firmly in 3 star territory though was the amazingly sloooooooow service. It wasn't busy but trying to flag down servers was agonisingly impossible. I've read other Yelp reviews saying that the wait was long when it gets busy but it wasn't busy this morning.However, despite that, the wonderful Yelp company was entertaining as usual. Lovely to meet Deborah G and of course, the core of the London Yelp Elites. Let's meet somewhere else next time, guys!",

Inside it is true that there could be a slightly more homely ambience...Flat Whites are splendid and their cakes are delicious. French Toast is divine.Try it out!",

It's been excellent nearly every time and my colleague and I refer to the lovely girls working there as the Sirens of Lantana as we find it difficult to resist the attraction of the fine coffee. Lantana does have one minus point against it though, and it's quite a big one. I went there and sat down with a friend who had a terrible espresso. We complained and were given another one that was equally bad, but the person serving proceeded to try and give us a lesson in espresso. We both know how espresso should taste, and this was not it. She then tried some herself and agreed with us that it didn't taste right, but we still had to pay for it which I thought was rather cheeky. Lantana only gets 3 stars because of this infraction. It hasn't stopped me from going there, but they need to do better with so much competition in the area.",

On my latest London visit, he was uber excited to share Lantana with me. It was packed when we got there at around 1 on a Saturday. That's to be expected. The restaurant is a nice space, just a bit awkwardly laid out, which is very apparent with it's crowded. The food choices all looked wonderful and it was tough for all of us to decide. I ordered the poached eggs with harissa minus the chorizo. It was simply wonderful and fresh. Two of my eating buddies ordered the french toast, which was very sweet and very very good. I don't think I could eat a whole plate, personally, but if you have a sweet tooth... Service was on point when I was there and we were in the mood to linger and catch-up, so that worked in their favor. Nothing to really complain about except the layout of the restaurant and the lack of warmth closer to the front of the restaurant in the winter.",

(We don't usually blow our student budget this way...wait..I think i do. LOL)If Australia is all about brunches, I WANT TO GO NOW. :DI expected there to be a queue and there was. We waited around 20minutes before we were seated and we were given a small table usually set for 4, but it's okay, we're 3 asian ladies so we even had room spare. :D I've been reading so many reviews and the main thing that I been dying to try was the baked eggs and i finally managed to. It was really good, the sauce was good, the bread was good, if only the eggs were runnier, I think I would have died and gone to heaven. My friend also ordered the same dish and he agreed that it could've been much runnier. In total, we ordered steak sandwich which looked amazing, poached eggs on toast and also a banana bread with blueberry whipped butter which is on my to eat list next time I go. Another thing on my to try list for next time is the flat white (i've been hearing rave reviews and i had a dodgy stomach on that particular day so i stuck with lemon ginger tea which was FILLED with honey!) My friends tried it and they think it's one of the better coffees around London. Also, I've never been to Aussieland but the people I ate with have and they really felt it was definitely an australian cafe. Success on Lantana's part! Service was very friendly, from the door to the end of the meal. I was expecting to have food staggered, esp after reading reviews here, \u00a0but surprisingly even though they were busy, all the dishes came out at the same time. So can't fault them. I'll definitely be back...when i don't have a student budget.",

Lantana apparently drives people to such madness... Another of the Australian brunch places. Loved by Time Out (I suspect because their offices are close). I am not sure what distinguishes it from its other, less popular brethren (or mates) as whilst the coffee was good the food was less so. The dishes we all ordered suffered from what I am beginning to recognise as a typical Aussie food problem - textureless mono taste blocks is what I shall call it. The food is lightly heated, it melds and pools together, the toast has no crisp, the fritters no carbon. Blah. So whilst it may be good and nutritious it is also akin to baby food not a real distinct breakfast. That said, it is busy, its independent, the service can be great or terrible and it looks cool... Price - \u00a32.20 for a flat white and up to \u00a310 for textureless mono taste blocks",

There was also a generous dollop of ricotta on each piece. So much food that I thought it may be a struggle to finish it. \u00a0So it proved, as it was a bit too much sweet stuff to eat at once. I helped my wife finish off her toast to get a savoury counterbalance.When you turn up, make sure you get someone's attention. It's busy, so you might be waiting by the door for a while otherwise. \u00a0It looks like a trendy place and the conversation and activity makes it seem louder than the average place.Total cost for our two meals and two coffees was around \u00a328.

I was apprehensive at first - it looks a lot like every other demonstratively independent coffee shop, who in their attempt to be special all end up being the same. But fear not, this place may not be radically different from its peers, but it is quite good at what it does.We grazed our way through the menu and were never disappointed. The confit duck leg is probably my favourite, but they've also hit a few high notes in the ever changing array of quiches and salads. Or should I recommend the burger with beetroot? Or the fish cakes...? It's a hard choice among some solid lunch classics.",

I'm used to a different kind of smoothie in America and thus was not expecting this concoction.It was okay, mind you, but just not what I was looking for.My co-inhabitants enjoyed their food but it didn't really whet my appetite (okay so blame me I judged the book by its cover & didn't try any of the food!).Perhaps on another trip will I try out Lantana once more.The staff is VERY friendly though and the overall environs were neat-o \u00a0=)",

It just made us want the rest of us to give up our fancy plates just to eat hers instead.Beet stained smoked salmon - Not sure if the states don't really have this or I've never seen it but the salmon was BRIGHT red. A little off putting but tasty nonetheless. Corn Fritters - Yum, delicious, perfectly fried and slightly burnt. Banana Bread - Beautiful to look at, sweet to eat.

Not your standard egg benedict... Great place to try dishes that are slightly more different, slightly more adventurous. Only problem for me they dont take reservations, so for brunch at the weekend you will have to queue - and even for someone like me who doesnt like to queue its well worth the wait!",

After spending a good 15 minutes looking through the menu, both myself and my friend decided to go for the grilled halloumi with courgette bread. Perhaps a little on the pricey side after 11ish pounds, but after taking the first mouthful, I had no qualms about the price tag. It was a delicious mix of salty and sweet. Best breakfast I've had in London by far. After hearing how good the cold brew was. I couldn't resist sampling that either. So good, would definitely recommend it.Unfortunately, as I've seen on most reviews, the service left a bit to be desired. But, whilst the service could be improved, don't let that put you off visiting, the food is enough to make you forget about everything else.",

These were close friends I hadn't seen in years, so clearly we were in the mood to settle in, drink loads of coffee and catch up. I had the Smashed avocado & streaky bacon on sourdough toast with poached egg & rocket. It was delicious, the avocado was on point, perfectly ripe and melded so well with the egg and the halloumi cheese. Ambiance in the Lantana is very relaxed, although even on a Monday at 11am it was packed! Only thing I would note is the service was on the slower side, it took quite a while to get our bill, but I think that had more to do with a lack of servers. Who would have thought it be so busy on a Monday! If I may suggest - get on the cappuccino or late roller coaster ... they were phenomenal. I live in the States and frankly even in NYC you can get some pretty shit coffee, but maybe because of the beans or just the skill of the barista, the drinks were top notch.",

The coffee is spot on too, so there is very reason why London has claimed this as one of the best spots for breakfast in the city. Everything is done well and presented with care, so it makes you feel as though you're eating somewhere with a much, much higher price tag. \u00a0 The staff are mostly Aussies (maybe that's changed, but it's not a bad thing) they're super friendly and always willing to accommodate any food allergies etc.",

We ordered the french toast & vegetarian breakfast which were both delicious. I felt like genuine effort and care had gone into our meals, the flavours were amazing, yet both were served quickly. The staff were great, very attentive but not pushy at all, we had a very friendly waitress from New Zealand who was great. Will definitely be back.",

Lantana is basically a minuscule space with a lot of tables crammed into it (it's certainly a wonderful place to eavesdrop) and a near-constant queue.I've found their flat whites very strong before, but of course that's not particularly unusual. However my friend had a latte yesterday and couldn't actually finish it, it was so bitter. Not ideal for a place that raves about their 'superior' coffee.The staff are polite, but not at all knowledgable or able to be relied upon to deliver the right coffee, let alone to the right table. In a place with hardly any tables, this is quite some feat.The food was good - lots of meat on my beef brisket sandwich, and the Thai green curry looked lovely, so the chefs are clearly keeping up their side of the bargain. Shame the mediocre coffee, dippy service and undeserved hype aren't.",

On a nice sunny weather, the outdoor seating would be much better! Very much in love with the setting and the atmosphere of this place, unfortunately it is quite hard to get a seat if you have a big group. I'd say 4 is a good size to occupy one table. For couples you might have to share a table with others if it gets too pack.What we ordered:French Toast - Crispy bacon, blueberries, yoghurt and maple syrup Breakfast burger - Sausage, cheese, spinach, fried egg, hollandaise sauce and side of halloumiLatte and black Americano I'd recommend all the above. The French toast was really crispy on the side, it looked like they added some layer of crust but the toast was fluffy at the same time. The hollandaise sauce on the breakfast burger was perfect and the sausages were juicy (so glad it wasn't dried).?If you're on \"Cheat Day\" and \"Calorie don't care day\" please check this place out!",

At our arrival there was a line of waiting people but the waitress told us we only had to wait for 20 minutes so we decided to give it a shot - and I'm glad we did! The food was absolutely fantastic and somewhat healthy. I'm not that big of a fan of English breakfast which is to fat and greasy for me, but the breakfast at Lantana has the best from English breakfast combined with some rather healthy components. Had the Full Lantana which is served with two eggs just like you want them cooked - I decided to go for poched eggs. It was served with lovely beans (and I usually hate beans!), sourdough toast, mushrooms, salad and a couple of slices of bacon. My boyfriend had a dish with a lot of avocado and eggs and herbal salad. Fast and polite service from the staff - worth the waiting time!",

    "text": "I was staying very close to Soho on a recent trip to London and I wanted to find a good place to brunch nearby. We initially decided to try out The Breakfast Club as it seems very popular but it turned out to be TOO popular as there was a queue of around 15 people even at quarter to 10 on a Sunday morning. Not wanting to wait an hour for breakfast we settled on Lantana, which was just a couple of streets away. There is a nice relaxed vibe to this place, even though it was very busy when we arrived. We managed to get a seat at the window which was perfect to watch the world go by. The menu is quite extensive and offers a wide range of interesting brunch dishes, instead of your usual variations on Eggs Benedict. It actually took us a while to decide because so many dishes sounded delicious. I ended up picking avocada, poached egg, dukka and courgette salad on toast and added chilli jam for \u00a31 (definitely worth adding). My boyfriend went for The Full Lantana (their version of a full English) and added black pudding. The dishes were very tasty, as was the coffee. We didn't feel rushed and it was a nice way to spend our Sunday morning. My only criticism is the price. I know London is generally more expensive than Glasgow but \u00a334 for two seemed a bit excessive. The full breakfast including black pudding came to \u00a315.50, which I find a bit high. Nevertheless it is definitely a nice place to grab some brunch in Soho without having to wait in a long queue.",

    "text": "I caught up with two friends a few months ago for brunch and one of them suggested Lantana Cafe in Central London as it was an Aussie cafe and being an Australia who else could she go there with? Sound logic in place we set off one morning for our long overdue catch up. When we arrived there was a waiting list and after about a 20-30 minute wait our spot in on the list had come and our table was ready so we entered the cafe and were brought to a long table in their downstairs seating area. We were given 3 seats at one end of the table and another group on the waiting list used the other part of the table.The moment we were given our menus we realised this would be a tough decision. Every item on the menu sounded delicious and reminded me of the cafes and brunch culture back home in Australia. We spent a little while musing over the menu but soon came to a decision otherwise we knew we could spend all day as all the options sounded delicious.I however could not go past the English muffin burger in the end 'English muffin w/ sausage patty, bacon, fried egg, hollandaise butter, smoked cheddar, spinach and chilli jam' (\u00a39.50) and ordered a pot of tea for one to go with it. My friends A and C however went our other main favourite on the menu of 'Smashed avocado and streaky bacon on sourdough toast w/ a poached egg and rocket' (\u00a38.50) which I can tell you was a great pick also and the portion of avocado in the dish was on the more generous side which I love to see! The ladies got an espresso and coffee to go with their meals.The English muffin was well put together with fresh and quality ingredients. The portion sizing was also just about right for someone being moderately hungry, if you like a big meal for breakfast I would suggest ordering a side with this just to be sure you'll be filled up. A and C were both impressed with their dish and said the portion size was just right. We watched the other group sharing the table with us order a few different dishes to us and I have to say I do not think there is a single dish on the brunch menu here that you could go wrong with.Service was friendly and prompt, with no request too big or small being a problem. I highly recommend you check this place out for brunch, especially if you are used to the service, portions and brunch menu style of Australia!",

No fried eggs, rather poached or scrambled eggs, served with loads of fresh rocket if I remember correctly. It is rather expensive for a breakfast (+\u00a315 but I had coffee and orange juice) but you are getting freshly made good quality food. The decor is a clean, light, bright and quite contemporary style which certainly adds to the experience. It's a bit out of the way (for me anyway, since I usually venture to the Soho coffee shops) situated in a pretty little pedestrianised street in Noho, but word has spread quickly on this place and the last time I went it was completely packed, so yes, better get there extra early. Or extra late. Pros- delicious fresh tasty breakfasts- nice decor - nice area Cons- popular so gets very full",

I've been back a couple of times over the last month to do some work and it's a lovely place to sit and chill out. Or have a quick meeting. The staff are lovely. Really friendly. I like it here. I still think it's a bit pricey, but a takeaway coffee is still takeaway. If you have time to sit in, it make things a whole lot nicer. I might have to have a brownie too. * I came here for coffee yesterday. I can't say anything bad about the service, the coffee, the food or the atmosphere. I was only getting coffees and brownies for me and the boys in the office and felt totally welcomed while i stood and waited. They drew lovely swirly things on my latte as well so that looked very pretty (then i ruined it by putting sugar in). The brownies were brilliant. It took me all day to eat mine, and there's still one in the office as my friend couldn't eat his. I'd suggest buying one and sharing it. I did nearly come back for lucnh, but as my best mate pointed out, it's really expensive, and as we were still waiting for pay day, it was too pricey for a normal lunch day. And unfortunately that's why I can only give this place three stars. I like it. Really really like it. Everything was great. It's too expensive. Way too expensive. I bought 3 lattes and three chocolate brownies yesterday to take away. The bill was \u00a314.10.",

I don't care if my barista is surly, its their prerogative as they drink too much coffee so have massive mood swings. But its my first time in Lantana, and asking what coffee they have seemed to be a sin (I was hoping for some sort of brew bar as like I said I'd heard good things). So anyway the latte art was sloppy, it was poured from the same jug so the first flattie was too fluffy and it was actually on the cold side. Probably a cold cup. Com'on guys sort it out!",

    "text": "\"Lantana\" is a plant introduced to Australia that now grows everywhere there. This place, of the same name, is a reverse transplant: a restaurant with Australian owners, and that brings the varied, fresh, and fusion view of breakfast food that is so popular in Oz. Lantana is small, bright, and open. They put some food out on the counter that immediately fires up the hunger. There are stools at a counter looking out the front window, and a couple of tables outside. I brought in a booking of 9 people and, despite it already being quite busy, they got our orders out in reasonable time. The food was delish: really well-selected flavours, and it looked great. Go for breakfast (until noon M-F, all day Sat) or lunch (after noon). The portions were not gut-busting, so if you're looking to stuff yourself you might need to order a side. But if you want something really tasty and different from a fry-up - see their current menu here (scramblingeggs.blogspot.\u2026) - get in and try it. The coffee is excellent, too, from the Monmouth Coffee Company (qype.co.uk/place/82203-M\u2026) . For those who work near Goodge Street and are in a rush, never fear: I'm told they do takeaway.",

    "text": "This is one of the few places near Charlotte St. that not only makes a proper flat-white but also has delicious, fresh, yet not too guilt inducing treats (such as perfectly proportioned oatmeal chocolate chip hazelnut cookies), so that alone merits four stars in my opinion. But aside from the coffee/treats, Lantana is a great place to pick up lunch. I've only ever eaten at the take away section, as I work in the area, but it's the perfect go-to spot, especially because you can box up the right amount of food that leaves you feeling like you've had a sensibly nutritious but not overly virtuous lunch. They have a rotating selection of three different salads per day (the lemon almond cous cous is delicious, lots of almonds). They also have different puff pastry tarts each day and very good sandwiches. Some of the salads can be a bit heavy on the oil, but in general they are quite healthy: think bases of chickpeas, quinoa, roast veggies. The one thing I will say is that the wraps are a bit lacking in the flavor department (but in my opinion this is the general fate cold wraps) and I havent had much success with any of the soups; they tend towards the watery side and the minestrone I had one day was almost inedibly bland. Not perfect overall, but some real standout menu items.",

On my second visit, my food didn't arrive, but I prompted the waitress and she was really nice about it. So I'm torn about going back again. It is admirable that the owner has made an apology on one of the blogs and my sympathy goes to her. I think the laid back vibe of the place can be attributed to the sense of a group of friends who're twenty-somethings running their dream caf and so it's sad when customers get the wrong end of treatment by feeling like they're 'in the way'. Although I didn't experience any of the negatives mentioned in other reviews, it feels awful to read them. I get the sense that the people who wrote the negative reviews were being really gracious too - even apologising for their unhappiness. Wow! That means the cafe has real potential if in the face of my cafe deal-breakers people can be so gracious. My cafe deal-breakers are: being ignored, being glared at, being talked about by staff within my earshot, being kept waiting for longer than 40mins, being told to leave!! Would be interested to hear other people's deal-breakers too...btw, has anyone tried the cafe in Copenhagen called Bang and Jensen -that place is awesome! Peace to all.",

It took me a while to get round to taking the offer up (still pretty annoyed) but yesterday I went - I had good food and polite service. The place was a bit queue'y but nothing to make my blood boil. Coffee excellent as ever. --- 1* When I first stumbled on this place a couple of months ago, I was happily in love and glad to recommend it to friends. Sadly the honeymoon period seems to be over. Despite impressive coffee, an inventive and well executed menu and a playful, elegant interior (surely these three reasons are enough in themselves to suggest I had found a great local), I won't be visiting Lantana again. I won't go into the details here for fear of sounding puerile or melodramatic, but I can summarise with the conclusion that this was the rudest and indeed worst service I have ever received in London. I was enraged to the point of leaving the cafe before placing an order and appalled to be entirely dismissed by noxious, disinterested sarcasm when returning to explain my disappointment later in the day. If you can tolerate being treated with utter contempt, you'll find good things. Otherwise, I recommend finding somewhere with a little more soul, humanity (in fact) and decent manners. A hot spot for hipster masochists.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were thrilled when we discovered this place as we live around the corner and the food here is good, honest stuff (the sort of place you can trust that the sausages are good.) We are self employed so often go in there for brunch or a coffee, read the newspapers they provide, and chill out. The staff were always friendly and the cakes very inviting. We had one issue when a bean-sized pebble was found in my boyfriend's food, but the lady said sorry and that it must have come from the rocket - and that's fine as these things happen. However, this morning (Saturday) I went there to meet a girlfriend for brunch. My friend was half and hour late so I had a 2 cappuccinos while I waited but didn't order 'til she arrived. We both had massive fry-ups, extra side orders after we had finished we continued to order more coffees and mineral water. It got a bit busy, being Saturday and as we were on a table that could seat 4 we were asked a few times if we minded sharing, which of course we didn't. We shifted up but other tables got free so we never actually had to share the table.One time the waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else as there were people waiting for a table (I couldn't see them) but we ordered further drinks and carried on chatting away. There was a table seating four that was free for ages. Then the waitress came over and seated some people there and said they were a party of 8 and would need our table. I assumed she meant for us to budge up but then realised there was nowhere for us to move to and that she meant she wanted our seats. At this point my friend still had half a cup of coffee and I had a bottle of mineral water so I asked the waitress if she meant she wanted us to go. She said that it was difficult to watch us sit there for such a long time when the cafe was so busy. I was very shocked as we had ordered plenty to eat and drink and still had drinks. As I tried to explain this she said she could move us downstairs and I said not to worry, that we would have the bill and go. She then responded by showing me the hand and walking off! She then went to the counter and started bitching about us to the other 2 members of staff there. When she came back I thought I must have misunderstood and tried to explain that we had been ordering food and still had drinks, and that we were a little bemused and offended by her attitude, to which she barked that I had upset her and she walked off again! At this point the 4 people sat at the table next to us and said their friends wouldn't be there for a while yet (I now wonder if there were more friends coming?) and we just laughed and tried not to show our embarrassment.A different waitress brought us the bill and I said I was sorry (yes I was STILL trying to be affable and I was apologising?!) if I had upset her friend but that I was a little offended and that we are regular customers here and all we wanted to do was finish our drinks and not be kicked out. She then replied very gruffly that yes I had upset her, that the other lady is the owner and that Lantana is her baby, and how hard she tries to make it work. Again, not a very customer -service friendly response.My friend finished her coffee (and I took my mineral water with me) and we left. All in all I feel very hurt that we were treated this way. We were made to feel very unwelcome and every time I tried to speak to the waitress/manageress she walked away making the issue very dramatic and made it look to other people that I was kicking up a fuss. I clearly have made the wrong assumption - I thought this was a lovely little cafe that prides itself on its chilled out, cosy, welcoming vibe. Sometimes it gets busy and I have waited my turn and happily queued for a table previously, and would never expect staff to tell those with tables to drink up and get out. They provide papers and magazines and offer you pitchers of tap water and I assumed that this meant they want you to stick around and relax. This is what I was doing (while still ordering more drinks!) and feel wholeheartedly sad that I have been treated like vermin and cannot go back to my (previously) favourite new place. A note to the owner - do not work in customer service if you don't like people. Try to manage any problems rather than just sticking your hand up and storming off. Furthermore, if you are working hard to make Lantana a success, it might be an idea to be nice to regular customers and encourage them to enjoy your cafe, rather than shoo-ing them away.",

Not cheap, it's true, but I think you get what you pay for; high quality ingredients and well-executed dishes, and friendly service. A great start to the day when you have to work at the weekend.",

    "text": "I'm sorry to say, I have to agree with neilgrayshon's review. My husband and I went to Lantana today, were seated, gave our order (2 coffees and a brownie) and then were ignored by the staff for 20 minutes. Our original server wouldn't even make eye contact with us when we tried to ask him where our coffees were, though he did manage to seat, greet and serve a couple who arrived ten minutes after we did. Another server noticed the expressions on our faces and asked if we were okay or wanted to order something. We told her we had ordered and were still waiting. She apologized and went back behind the counter...and then seemed to forget about us as well. All this for two coffees and a brownie I literally could have grabbed myself from the counter top! Meanwhile, other people around us were being seated and served. We eventually left without being served. I love to support local businesses rather than corporate giants, but in this instance we were (sadly) better served at Starbucks.",
