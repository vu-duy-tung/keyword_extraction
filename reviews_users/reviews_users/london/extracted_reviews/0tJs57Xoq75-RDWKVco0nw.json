I'm usually more interested in small, local places when I travel, but even if you prefer chains, give this place a chance anyway. Their cinnamon buns will be the sweet, sugary death of you, and you will LOVE IT. I didn't try their princess cake, but it looked beautiful in the case. You can also buy a huge variety of Swedish cookies, pastries, granola, and breads to take with you, which I strongly recommend. Coffee is a great partner to the cinnamon rolls, and this was one of the few places where I felt cozy and not cramped in the tiny space.",

    "text": "In the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden, you can find a tiny oasis of calm and delicious food: Bageriet. They have great cinnamon buns as well as other Swedish pastries and cakes that will make even your greyest day much sweeter.I walked past Swedish bakery and coffee shop Bageriet located in a small alley in Covent Garden a number of times, sadly always when it was closed. When I was in the area this morning, I seized the opportunity and stopped by.Bageriet is a lovely little shop and now in December, it was in full Christmas swing with beautiful Swedish and English carols playing in a loop. I find that this kind of music can be pretty annoying these days, but at Bageriet it somehow worked for me and on a cold day, it created a very relaxed and comforting atmosphere in an otherwise busy area.Being at a Swedish bakery, there was no way around a kanelbulle, or cinnamon bun in English. To complete the \"fika\", as the Swedes call it, I had my kanelbulle with a nice flat white. The cinnamon bun was very tasty and I could have eaten many more...but I decided to try something else and went for the apple bun, which was just as delicious. I must admit that it was a little bit disappointing that they do not have fresh juices, but then, I could check out a very Swedish drink that I had not even heard of before, Trocadero. It is not quite a fresh juice, but it was refreshing and tasted fine.Bageriet really is a beautiful place to take a break and enjoy some Swedish treats, baked to perfection and served by very friendly staff. A place to visit again.",

I had two of those (couldn't resist) cinnamon and cardamon bun and a ball with almond filling, yum yum. And the most delicious coffee in the cutest cup. This is what I'm talking about. Other coffee shops should look and learn. It is so disappointing when visiting a coffee house and ending up paying a hefty bill for a piece of disgustingly dry and tasteless 'cake' and something that looks but doesn't taste like coffee at all. This place is nothing like those things. The only criticism I've got is the lack of space. But I've learned you can't have everything, can you.",

Bageriet is the tiniest coffee shop on a tiniest side street near Covent Garden. Depending on what you are familiar with, it's next to Peruvian restaurant called Lima or opposite Stanford, the map store. Their speciality is Scandinavian cakes. They usually have a few Danish pastries at the window, and have cakes and breads inside. There are two tables inside and one small round table and a pair of garden chairs. That's it. You can imagine it's very hard to find seats on weekend afternoon. The cakes here are just brilliant. When I have some free time on weekday, I like to sit on one of the seats and indulge myself with a cake or two. Don't judge me. They are really good. I even order a coffee occasionally as it seems to be what grown-up people do.",

There are so many unique sweets to select from, and in modest portions as well so you can buy up a few and split amongst friends. They have the tallest coconut macaroons I've ever seen and the fluffiest sugared pretzel breads too, but if you do go for the first time, you must absolutely have a slice of the Swedish princess cake (or prinsesst\u00e5rta). These are the delightfully pretty green cakes in the glowing refrigerator beside the cash register, and one slice will only run you only about \u00a33.60. This option is particularly good for those who enjoy vanilla pudding, fresh cream, and fruit jam, because there are generous layers of all three wedged between thin layers of white cake, and of course, all topped with a beautiful layer of green marzipan dusted with powdered sugar and topped with a chocolate swirl.",

What is even better is that if you ordered this \u00a33.80 slice of cake, you will then fall in love with the cake like Princes fall in love with Princesses! It's so light and fluffy inside. The marzipan doesn't over power you with sweetness (I am usually not a fan of marzipan!!!!)The shop is tiny but it's very cosy, and all the bakery products look amazing. There are maybe 2-3 tables to sit on so you have to be fast or be prepared to do a takeaway instead...I have introduced at least 5 people to this place already, I am sure I will hear good things about it from them!",

Their hot chocolate is also very rich and indulgent with a nice hint of cinnamon.

I tried the princess cake, cinnamon bun, and chocolate ball along with the largest cup of tea I've ever seen (it was practically a bowl!). All of the pastries were very tasty, but the princess cake definitely took the cake! The sponge cake was soft and light, with a layer of creme, raspberry jam, and of course, pastel green marzipan delivering the perfect amount of sweetness. (I'm drooling just thinking about it.)As other reviewers have mentioned, the seating is limited, but my friend and I were lucky enough get seats by the window. The servers were friendly and kindly recommended pastries and refilled the hot water. All in all, I love this place and plan on coming back to try the other pastries/biscuits.",

However, the cream was much lighter than I thought and the marzipan exterior added a different texture to the soft cake that I appreciated. They had a bunch of other pastries that looked equally delicious. However, my one stomach was unable to try all of them. Would I come here again? Of course; I would like to try the other pastries as well. I probably won't eat the princess cake again (even though it's good) since I've had better.",

    "text": "I walked out of Stanfords & the most amazing smell assailed my nose. It was like fresh wine was being mulled, it filled the street and it only served to make me extremely hungry.I had bookmarked Bageriet on Yelp, quite some time ago and since it looked like it was in the area, I decided to head there for a coffee. (Its in the tiny lane running along Stanfords)Imagine my surprise when the aroma got stronger as I got closer to this cafe. I had to ask & the lovely lady manning the counter said that it was the smell of the ginger & spice cookies baking in their basement kitchen.The cafe is really tiny, just enough seating space for around 6 people (tight fit) and a tiny table for 2 outside, but it was raining, so I just picked up a bunch of stuff to bring home.On heavy recommendation, I tried the Princess Cake - this was layers of sponge with custard and raspberry jam and a marzipan/fondant like icing. It was so pretty & colourful & I loved the taste, but the Mr. wasn't too keen on it.The Mazarin / Notkongress & Almond Tart were a amazing. My outstanding favourite of all the things I picked up on this trip were the hazelnut tarts. But then, I do love hazelnuts.I also picked up 2 packs of tiny Swedish cookies - almost like shortbread, but Oh so good. They just melted in my mouth & ***Guilty Confession***, I finished a whole packet with a cup of tea.They brew fresh coffee on site, but I didn't try any on this occasion. They seemed to have 3-4 sandwiches at the counter, but 97% of what is sold in this store, is firmly in the \"sweet\" section.The cinnamon buns too are very highly recommended & they did look good, but I'm not a big fan of bread/buns. I'll take cake & cookies any day.The prices are slightly on the higher side, but the quality is very very good.Looks like I will be stopping here, each time I am in the vicinity.#YelpEveryDamnDay",

I live in the USA- but coming here was the best thing that I have ever accomplished.  I highly recommend their cream cheese as well. It makes me ponder my life and if I should should consider buying a pet lion. Think about it. You are the me and I am you.",

I wouldn't plan on descending on this place with your ten closest mates ( four of them wouldn't get a seat for a start), but for a more intimate group or to take away I thoroughly recommend this place.",
