    "text": "pretty good but nothing special.Location:There was around a 20 minute wait at 1310 on a Saturday. The restaurant has that industrial chic look with a slight 'farmhouse' twist (my friend described it that way. It's hard to elaborate but it really does fit). The booths upstairs are pretty comfy though the cushion stops at shoulder height sadly.Toilets here bear a striking resemblance to caravan. Again, they have that slightly farmhousey vibe in keeping with the rest of the restaurant but are also unisex and also, like caravan, feature exfoliating aesop hand wash.Food:Perhaps I should have just stuck to the baked eggs as recommended, but instead we ordered an omelette and an eggs benedict. Both were good but nothing to shout about. We also ordered fries served with Aioli (the Aioli was really nice), and a side of herbed avocado.Assuming you like avocado, order it as a side regardless of what you get. It was the one standout item by far.I personally had a banana milkshake which I loved as well. Particularly as the portion was very generous. Slightly less thick than most milkshakes which some people might take grievance with but I didn't mind.Overall:I really enjoyed it but I think workshop which is similar, and just down the road, is notably better for food. That being said, I'll have to return to try the baked eggs at some point.",

    "text": "Ozone are coffee roasters but also happen to have a restaurant and in the basement they have a full sized coffee roaster too! I'm always on the look out for great breakfast spots as I'm a bit of a skylark and I always wake up hungry! A lot of places that do a breakfast menu tend to offer standard breakfast options. So I really love it when there's a bit of a twist, great example would be places like Dishoom's Bacon & Egg Naans (you're missing out if you haven't had one yet!).Though this isn't at all earth shattering, it's at least different! The menu is seasonal, so we got the Autumn menu. Eggs Benedict minus the boring bland English Muffins, replaced with bubble & squeak... yummy! The sweet potato rosti is quite a large plate but the mixture of the flavours were just perfect and really does full you up for hours on end! They have seating around the kitchen which let's you keep an eye on the chefs as they prepare the food. Overall, a nice little restaurant for a small group of friends or on your own to get some alone time (bar seats)... Like it!#greedymoo #londonfoodie #foodporn #breakfast",

    "text": "On food and drink alone, I would have rated Ozone higher - the coffee and omelette with eggplant, cauliflower and capers was stunning. However, the service here is so subpar that I'm not sure I would return. Though there was a line out the door, I was seated quickly at the bar as a party of 1. Immediately (and I mean immediately), a server was at my side requesting my order - I literally hadn't gotten to reading the second item on the menu. Seemingly as punishment, the staff was wholly inattentive the remainder of my meal. I certainly understand they were very busy that morning, but they didn't seem particularly short staffed, simply mediocre. Once my meal was finally delivered, I was not checked on again until 15 minutes after I had finished my meal and pushed my plate to the side for removal. In all, my breakfast for one took about an hour and 20 minutes from start to finish. Would seem the line wouldn't be so long if you could turn your seats over faster than that. If you have loads of time to waste, by all means try it out. The omelette was one of the best I've had. I would recommend skipping the bacon, though - it was very fatty and tasted only like the oil it was drenched in.",

    "text": "A nice trendy coffee shop, full of people just catching up for breakfast, having work meetings or just enjoying the coffee.The coffee is very good. I ordered a Mocha, and they were aware their coffee is what everyone wants, thus why it probably had the least chocolate of any Mocha I've ever ordered. Only when I got to the bottom, did I notice 3 tiny lumps of chocolate :/. However their chai tea latte, is possibly the best I've ever had. Spicy, without being overly \"spice\" tasting. It's just a shame it comes in such a small glass, you really need two to be satisfied, or have it with a coffee of course.The Smoked fish kedgeree looked amazing, but I went with ordinary eggs and sourdough bread. I couldn't complain, it was good, but wish it had been accompanied by a relish like the Tomato Kasundi at Workshop Coffee.The staff were great, considering as people continually joined our table, they had to keep getting menus and additional drink orders, but everything came and you leave with a smile on your face and the smell of warm roasting coffee lingering in your nostrils and your clothes.The coffee is apparently so good, they'll also roast beans to order for you right there. If you need to ask the price for such a service though, you'd better stick to the supermarket beans :D",

I felt well posh.The coffee was tasty. It's a good sign when I do not feel the need to add sugar to my cup.Service was friendly but there was a strange mixup on toast. We ordered breakfast and halfway through realized that my friend's potted egg thing could do with some more bread. Ordered quickly after the realization but took a very long time to get said toast. Anywho. A bit pricey but would go again if in the neighborhood.",

On the plus side, I now know what kind of hob I want in my future kitchen!My eggs were delish as was the sourdough I had them on. My coffee was amazeballs and obviously my newfound coffee persistence is having an effect of (necessarily) decreasing my caffeine sensitive because I didn't have my usual jittery buzzingness afterwards!There was a bit of food-envy courtesy of the guy next to me who had the veggie breakfast but all-in-all, a great experience and wonderful food :)",

    "text": "Ozone's space immediately reminded me of Sightglass Coffee in SF, with an industrial feel, the roaster down below, and seating up above. \u00a0The coffee was on the same level, too. \u00a0In case you haven't been to Sightglass, this is a high compliment. \u00a0I didn't write down what my wife and I each had, but they were 2 distinct single origin varietals - probably Central American and African, if our usual preferences held. Several brewing methods are available; I had an Aeropress, she had pourover. \u00a0Both were truly excellent - certainly among the best coffees I've had in London and in the top 10 I've had anywhere. \u00a0The quality of the raw coffee they're using must be high, and the brews were richly flavored and neither over- nor under-extracted. \u00a0 A few nitpicks keep them at 4 stars rather than 5: 1) My coffee was not hot when it arrived. \u00a0My wife's was. \u00a0We had them brewed in 2 different ways, but please either serve each as it is completed or time the brewing better.2) The filter coffee prices are pretty steep (\u00a34+ if I recall correctly). \u00a0I'm happy to spend that much occasionally, since the coffee is really good, but it will keep them from being a regular haunt for me.3) I enjoy watching cooks in action as much as anyone, but to maximize the enjoyment of my coffee, I'd prefer if the kitchen was a little more enclosed or separated from the main seating area. \u00a0I'm fine with a coffee roastery smelling like roasting coffee (although it's more acrid than one might expect and always biases my palette in favor of lighter roasts while I'm there). \u00a0But having the place smell a bit like a diner throws me off when I'm paying \u00a35 for a high end, delicately-flavored coffee.Still, clearly a great place for coffee, and impressive enough that I'll be bringing out-of-town guests to try it.",

Here's how it went down : Walked in, ordered a coffee, paid, was offered a loyalty card, accepted the offer, got aforementioned clipped (whoop whoop, retro). Then stood around in the very crowded \"bar\" area.It's laptops everywhere, meetings going on, sightsee-ers, people eating big breakfasts, while on laptops, men with beards, the buzz, the relaxed beats, the roaster, and people having meetings over laptops. It took a little while - busy time, noon on a Thursday - and then I got handed a take out cup. Whoops! Didn't order coffee to go. So I asked for a \"to-stay cup please?\"Oh dear, there's a system. I didn't know about it. I'd done the usual : go in, order, pay, wait for coffee, find a seat. EXCEPT @Ozone you get a seat first! Next to the people with the laptops having a meeting. Ooohhhhhhh!Alright, I'm not in a hurry. I am now seated, uh oh, bit wobbly. I am brought a glass of water. Thank You!My latt\u00e9 comes. It's small. It's powerful. I like it.

If Ozone was anywhere else in London, I would probably give it a 4 star rating, though I have to admit that my go-to breakfast spot it just around the corner at Salvation Jane (now again know as Lantana) Likes: Breakfast - the eggs are a delight and if you're having breakfast have them with some smashed avocado. \u00a0Dislikes: After going a couple of times and finding that the cold drip was out for the day, I finally made it in to give it a try. Honestly, I don't know what all the rave was about - the coffee as Ozone is great, but not the cold trip.Service: Awesome. Here they know their coffee and if you're looking to try something different and are willing to experiment (and give some info on what you like and don't like) you can definitely walk away from here having tried something new.",

We had no idea what to expect but we clearly were not disappointed.The kind of industrial / run down atmosphere, with the kitchen in the middle of the place, and downstairs the place where they roast their own coffee, just gives a great feeling to the place.Either tables for 6 with benches like in a diner, or along the counter, or a few small tables.First of all, the coffee. I've now learned that New Zealanders roast great coffee :-)And for the eggs: excellent. I've had the eggs Benedict and I loved the way they put the eggs on a potato cake instead of bread. The other egg-based dishes also looked excellent.Staff is very nice and efficient.Amusing detail: a guy who arrived before us pretended to be us by citing our name which he saw on the reservation list... Staff managed to get us another table, and we greeted the guy by our name when we saw him ;-)",

Ozone specializes in top-quality coffee with in-house roasting and a variety of select beans available for consumption on premises or to take home for your own brewing pleasure. The cafe-roastery-restaurant is housed in a large converted industrial space, with some nice bench and window (i.e. People watching) spaces upstarts, and a larger, albeit a little more cellar-like \u00a0space downstairs. Coffees are prepared in the classic Italian way as well as filtered and new-fangled methods such as \"aeropress\". The food here is fantastic as well, again this place is all about quality ingredients and attention to detail (a favorite of mine is the Buford brown poached eggs on sourdough with a side of avocado and cardamom). Perhaps a little bit pretentious, but it's London. It ain't cheap but as is often the case in this town, you get what you pay for!",

Damn, yelp should really give you an advice, something like \"hey you come here once in a week and you never wrote about this place, what's happening?!\". Once a week (at least!) in fact, I came here for a coffee. Why? Easy:BEST COFFEE IN TOWN.Seriously. No even more, this is no coffee, this is liquid crack. It's perfect. You know when you meet your half? he guy/girl you say to yourself \"hey, this is the one\"? Well, apply this to coffee. That's what Ozone is. Your half, toasted and roasted.But it's not only the coffee, when I do really want to indulge myself, I come here for another dish: benedict eggs! Everything in the dish is perfect, the egg, the potatoes, the sauce. It's just incredible! Somebody else (silly people not understanding the value of benedict eggs :P) told me there are some other dishes too, but I'm sorry I'm not moving out from my perfect dish! It's just as good as it gets!You know in Italy they say \"Visit Naples then you can die\". Nope, that's wrong. Drink Ozone coffee and then you'd wish to live forever and have it over and over every day up to the end of time!!",

And a side of pecan, parsley pepper, olives, and artichoke topped with a delicious emmental cheese and anchovy crumble! The chicken has a crispy garlicky skin and will just melt in your mouth! The sweet potato, topped with soft cheese and herbs (thyme and sage) were so flavourful and delicious I wish I could have eaten more!Luckily I managed to order a dessert (Madeleine with rhubarb compote) - a combination of sweet, sour and fruitiness, which was the perfect finish to a absolutely perfect meal!",

We really enjoyed seeing the chefs at work and our own food being made. We saw a few things we'd like to try that we wouldn't have ordered unless we'd seen the finished product.

The breakfast was savory and delicious, and the coffee was fantastic! \u00a0The servers were helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be there---a big switch from the dour servers I'd encountered around the city. Being from Seattle, the land of specialty coffees, I know a thing or two about good roasts, and Ozone has some delicious beans. If you're not into watered down London coffee, head to Ozone for a lovely cup of coffee and their delicious food.",

Its a vast expanse of a place, but has been designed sensitively, so that even on a quiet weekday afternoon, you'd find it feeling free of the floating tumbleweed. This is industrial chic done with verve and imagination \u00a0as opposed to minimalism for the sake of lack of ideas or cheapness, a common trait in London cafes. I asked for the baked eggs and halloumi, which sounded fantastic, but it wasn't to be, no halloumi \u00a0and I am but a husk of a man without halloumi. Sadface. Instead I ate delicious vege eggs benedict \u00a0with big juicy portabello mushrooms, perfect eggs and bubble-n-squeak instead of bread. Touch! The non-vege options looked good too, but meat is dead to me. We tried several coffees. The flat white was great, punchy and creamy, the espresso was good, but the 'soft brew' filters weren't to my taste at all. An Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and an El Salvadoran, both roasted dark with big roasty flavours that overwhelmed most of the nuances of what were probably excellent green beans. Oh well, pretty wicked overall.",

I was back in town after a long sabbatical last week and things haven't changed a bit, a lovely chilled environment - busy as hell but still feeling comfortable, with me even bumping into a couple of friends I hadn't seen for ages.

    "text": "We had gotten into a bit of a breakfast rut...so I'm laying in bed, basking in the early fall air, wanting some breakfast and feeling burned out on everything in our rotation. ::::lightbulb flashes:::: Me: ooooooo, baked eggs at Ozone. Husband: have you been there? Me: No, not for the eggs. Husband: Then how do you know they are good? Me: Grant T said they are really great. Husband: You are using last name initials...Me: Yelpers are always right. Husband: Fair enough. So we wander over to Ozone around 10am on Saturday, are quickly seated at the bar overlooking the (extremely efficient and tactile) cooks and kitchen. Already things are going well. Americanos appear. Even better. I order the (of course!) Baked Eggs with beans and cheese, which is accompanied by a thick slice of sourdough. Next time I'd even add a few strips of streaky bacon or sausage as a side. Once doubtful husband dove into a platter of eggs, beans, toast and a side of beans. I'd add avocado next time too, they looked super fresh and add a bit of ruffage to the mix. Both plates totally devoured. One important note: NO alterations or substitutions. They mean it. IT's cool though it means they churn out that food like nobody's business and no one gets confused. If you don't like something, pawn it off on your partners and you can customize through some added side dishes, of which there are plenty. The coffee is outstanding, roasted onsite. I dare you to find fault with an Ozone coffee -- I even stopped back on Sunday for a to-go cup after giving Salvation Jane a whirl (see, I am getting out of this rut, I tell ya). The feel is very industrial, clean, but somehow...warm. Very cool, but comfortable. The vibe is relaxed, the staff was on point during our visit, and people really seemed to enjoy the food and coffee. For under 30 quid we had two huge breakfasts, coffees and left feeling darn good about our newest recruit to the weekend circuit.",

Perfectly poached eggs atop multi grain toast, served with crispy (American style!) bacon, sausage, a potato stack (sort of like a less creamy dauphinoise) with seaweed, and a fresh pico de gallo - fresh ripe tomatoes with shallots and chills. Delicious!! Everything was cooked to perfection, and you can really taste the high quality in all the ingredients. Topping off a perfect fry up, was a delectable almond milk latte, brewed from coffee beans roasted in the basement! Staff was super friendly and despite arriving mid day on a Saturday we were seated right away. Place has a great vibe, and lots of amazing dishes on offer- can't wait for my return visit!",

We enjoyed a relaxing and tourist-friendly lunch in this local spot. Our espresso and cappuccino were spot on. I also popped by for a double espresso to go one morning and that was again perfectly made and quite tasty. I'm sure there is a Starbucks nearby but honestly, why go there when you can come here, have a proper coffee, without beans roasted to beyond well done!As for the meal, it was nicely presented but slightly lacking. I'm clearly not an expert on chips but these were a bit bland and perhaps under-cooked. Our salads were quite tasty and we'd eat here again, if we are in the area.",

They have a take-out area for pastries/coffee or you can eat in. The open kitchen concept was also something I liked as it was fun to see how quickly they are working to prepare the meals.The service was quick and friendly. 1. Coffee- I had a cappuccino and it was excellent.2. Pancake- My boyfriend had this and I couldn't help feel jealous. It tasted just as good as it looked.3. Granola with banana yogurt- this was so so good. I tried making my own granola at home after this and it wasn't quite the same. When I go back this will definitely be one of my stops.",

I decided to come to Ozone anyway, because the sound was partly down to the continuous roasting of coffee beans. Fresh coffee roasted on site? Good sign.I got a soya cappuccino and my partner got a soya flat white. We also shared a cinnamon raisin brioche. The coffee was beautiful, delicious and the soya milk didn't curdle. We weren't supposed to share the brioche, as my partner wasn't hungry, but he gave in; difficult not to given how amazing it smelled and tasted. It was on the pricey side for a breakfast place, but the coffee is top notch. Not a great place for a quiet conversation or working outside of the office, not cosy, but delicious coffee and baked goods. Maybe I will be back for brunch.",

Well, I probably just ordered the wrong dish since it's my first time trying it. it wasn't for me. So I'm probably biased.

ABSURD THAT I HAVE YET TO COMMENT ON OZONE.I like their style, I like their coffee, I like their food. Are we done here?Jkjkjkinda. I'll expand.Tucked away down Leonard Street, Ozone doesn't look like much from the street (unless you take a peek and see chic people working hard at the banquette along the window. That might tip you off). Walk inside, though, and it's set up similar to a bar. Like, a bar, bar. A drinking bar. Which works well. Takeaway orders at the bar, restaurant options seated around the bar, or at tables. Wholesale purchases down in the basement. Done and done and done; all needs covered.The staff KNOWS THEIR COFFEE STUFF. I usually go for the flat white: it's strong, and creamy, and delicious. It's a pricier flat white for London - 2.90 - but it's a cost I'm happy to absorb.The food here is *not* an afterthought. Think savoury scones (hint to the coffee shops of the world: more savoury baked goods, please! LOVE them), some gluten free options (grand), and little twists on classics. A banana bread with fermented pineapple, for example. A sausage roll with pork and peach. I like, I like.I've always just gone for the grab-and-go option, and not had a sit-down, but I think that should change. Soon.Yelp note: summertime? Ozone does a killer range of iced coffee options.",

It has a lot of potential given the beautiful space and excellent coffee.I had the toasted fruit bread with butter and jam. The bread itself was underwhelming, not that hot, and the butter is hard as a brick. It doesn't make for an enjoyable toast experience.I also had the omelette. I expected it to have the capsicum inside the eggs, but it was more like an onion omelette and there was so much oil! It was just flavorless and not nice.The coffee though is the saving grace. Well made and presented. Coupled with pretty good service, makes this place worth visiting.",

    "text": "Well - I've been here a week and a half and eaten here 4 times, and I'm a notoriously picky eater, so that should say something. Seriously, how misleading that this place is classified a cafe and has no menu or indication of the bustling restaurant on the website? Because I don't do coffee and NEVER would have come across it were it not for my more enlightened friends. Which would be a tragedy as the food here is FANTASTIC - very innovative, varied, a little fancy, definitely very hipster in keeping with the Shoreditch vibe, and they keep a seasonal menu. I MEAN SERIOUSLY IF YOU EAT IN ONE PLACE IN LONDON, THIS SHOULD BE IT. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant and provides a lovely view of watching the magic at work - you can see that they run a tight ship, and the food shows the care and quality that goes into choosing the menu items and ingredients. They've got that too-cool thing going - no need to advertise, no flashy sign [I'd miss it if it wasn't on my warpath] and yet it's packed inside. I've loved the smoked cauliflower & freekeh salad, beetroot risotto, bubble & squeak potato cakes/eggs benny, fry bread, pancake [with smoked custard], fenugreek and kasundi tortilla .... harissa mushrooms, chili butter cornbread ...I haven't had anything I haven't raved about yet! This is a restaurant I genuinely love supporting. JUST GO NOW K?",

    "text": "It has been a long time coming. Working up to Christmas and organising last minute holiday plans, I bring a new blog post for the new year. Brunch has to be one of my favourite meals, and you know when you visit a cafe, you are looking for that meal that just hits the spot.I had been meaning to check out Ozone Coffee Roasters last year after seeing them at the London Coffee Festival and also being from NZ I am a bit bias as the company and cafe are NZ owners.The inside has a very chic industrial vibe with the kitchen open in the middle of the cafe. Your classic mushrooms on toast bring a something little different mixed with onions and topped with creme friache and emmental. I thought it was seasoned well and was a good portion size, I just wish the food came out a bit hotter. I think from watching the chefs serve up the food, the plates sit on the side for a tad too long whilst plating and heating up the plates could make a huge difference. My dining chum had a few more complaints however. He found the bubble and squeak overpowered the dish, and the pork cheek was a bit lost between that and the hollandaise sauce. However huge thumbs up for perfectly cooked eggs.Overall a few hits and misses, but would return again and would recommend it to fellow diners.RatingFood: 7/10Service: 8/10Value for Money: Good11 Leonard St, EC2A 4AQOpening Hours:Mon-Fri 730-9pmSat-Sun 9am-5pm",

It's a relaxed atmosphere that makes you want to linger (much to the annoyance of the queue forming at the door no doubt!).I had the veggie breakfast, a last minute choice after spying the generous portion of the person sat next to me (always good to have a look around first!). It paid off, with poached eggs on sourdough accompanied by some nicely grilled halloumi and lovely flavours from mushrooms tossed with thyme and roasted tomatoes. My latte also hit the spot nicely. I felt a little rushed by our server at the end when she claimed not to know what cakes they had baked fresh that day - I don't think she expected me to wander around to the opposite side of the counter to find out for myself! But a slice of something lemony with two spoons rounded things off nicely :)On the pricey side then, as brunch venues in this area continue to push the boundaries of what they can charge for eggs on toast. But a good choice when you feel like a treat!",

Instead of English muffin, the eggs sit on top of breaded potato mash. Quite interesting and tasty indeed. They were poached near or at exact point of goodiness, so no complaint there. Yolks leisurely fill out the bacony base and then your stomach. This is what I like about eggs that way and this place did not disappointed me.Coffee is good, so we had a double.

Also, we had the chance to discover that not all the food items are as great as the kedgeree or the rhubarb pancake: the tortilla was an oily mess of onions and overcooked steamed eggs (when they start crumbling a little) which took some effort to finish, and the halloumi was soggy instead of the crisp rubbery texture that can be so glorious.Still relatively happy and would return.",

We were queuing for a table and two of us decided to buy coffee elsewhere while waiting. It turns out we got a table quite fast so we got in and were told by waitress #1 we couldn't have coffee from a different establishment, which was very understandable. So we told her we were just going to tell our friends what to \u00a0order and we would step outside to finish drinking it. One minute later waitress/manager (I think, or someone on a power rush) comes to our table and says in an uncalled-for very rude way that what we were doing was absolutely not allowed. So I repeated that we were just ordering but she was extremely sour and rude throughout. Honestly if it weren't for the lovely waiter we had after, I'd considering not going back. It's a pity that wonderful food gets ruined by people who should not work in the sector.",

    "text": "I seriously have to update this rating. What is wrong with me? Never in my life have I experienced something quite like Ozone coffee. Since moving to London, it's been my quest to find amazing coffee. Maybe the first day I went I was just in my own world or not thinking straight. I don't know, but I'm about to fill this review with ridiculous imagery, so be prepared.Has coffee ever made you sad? I can't say that it has for me. Angry, yes, when the coffee is just terrible, and I wish that I could take back my coffee order and not have to be horrified with what I was currently drinking. But sad? No. I stopped by Ozone to get some beans to try at home, but since I was there, I wanted to take some with me as well. I ordered a cappuccino and got some Ethiopian beans to take home. The smell of the freshly ground beans was divine. I got my cappuccino, and I took a sip. Their coffee is heaven in a cup. I wish I knew the words to describe what it tastes like! The coffee is a mix of sweetness, bitterness, and nirvana all rolled into one. The milkiness of the foam just smooths out the whole drink.I took it with me and jumped on the Northern line to London Bridge. As I stood there drinking my cappuccino and smelling the grounds, I was in bliss. I realized as the Tube made its stops on the way to my station, that my cup was growing ever more empty with every sip. I started to get sad. The coffee still tasted amazing, even this close to the end of the cup. A few more sips, and it was finished. My sadness increased. I realized that I wanted more: More of this delicious nectar from Ozone coffee. However, all I could do was stand there and stare at the empty cup in one hand and sniff the divine smell of the grounds in the other.I made some of their coffee and took it to work. The non-espresso version of there coffee is just as good. I sit there in the morning enjoying every morsel of heaven that pours over my lips. As my cup slowly empties, the sadness starts to swell inside as I know that I will have to wait until tomorrow to enjoy it again. Ozone coffee is conveniently located right off of the Old Street station. If I'm traveling to London on weekdays, my train goes right through there, and it is insanely easy to hop off the Tube and stop in. Unfortunately, on the weekends, my train skips Old Street completely. Which means that it is a bit harder for me to get to on days when I actually go into central London. Ozone coffee is going to make my weekend trips a bit more inconvenient. Oh, they also serve food. The pastries look amazing, but I have yet to try them. Maybe next time.",

Spacious and airy with plenty of seating and an impressive variety of foods and beverages (they also have Meantime Beer on tap and a full sit down restaurant for brunch/lunch).

    "text": "Down a back street, close to Old Street Station, Ozone Coffee provided very welcome relief from London's April showers today. The space is fantastic with an open kitchen and coffee counter at the centre and tables and bar seats around the edge. It feels more like something from New York than London. Downstairs you find not only more seating but also a giant coffee bean roaster which is used to make Ozone's own label coffee. As you would expect from a coffee roaster, the coffee hits the spot - both the Macchiatos and Lattes which we enjoyed were well made and appeared at our table almost as soon as they were ordered which was pretty impressive. The food was good as well. I opted for a bit of colonial comfort and ordered the Kedgeree. The fish was delightfully smokey and the poached egg was perfectly cooked (ie a liquid yolk but well cooked white). \u00a0The rest of the menu looked pretty interesting - plenty to explore on another occasion. Finally special mention needs to go to the toilet taps. They are (literally) bits of copper pipe (see the photo) which spout forth perfectly warm hand washing water. I have never seen their like before!",

No bright lights or pastels.this place is all wood and steel and gets down to the business of serving a great brunch. The first time I went here I had the omelette with red peppers and salmon. At the time I thought: Hm, \u00a39.50 for an omelette without even a crust of toast, is this worth it? Oh yes it was \u00a0big, fluffy and full of flavour. The quality here is excellent. Today I ordered the eggs benedict with salmon which was divine.The chai latte had a nice depth of flavour and even looked lovely (see photo attached). Overall, recommended!",

I was greeted with a smile, and the coffee was really good tasting.Based on those two factors, I decided to keep coming back, and started ordering Dirty Chai's. Never had one? Let me illuminate you to it's loveliness: Chai is a delightful mix of spices and flavours; a chai latte adds a bit of silky smoothness; a shot of espresso (not expresso, failed baristas...) gives it that kick that coffee lovers love. After only my 3rd visit, they remembered my order! Now they know what I'm having the second I walk in, and I still get a smile.This place has stolen my caffeinated heart!",

    "text": "I always thought Ozone is a weird name for a coffee place. \u00a0I mean, every time I hear the word, I immediately think of the group O-zone (...of Numa Numa fame), which is a bit annoying seeing as it comes up not infrequently in my research.The place itself has the rather in-vogue distressed ex-warehouse type look (which I'm sure cost a pretty penny to put up). \u00a0It's pretty spacious though, and I love the open kitchen in the middle back-to-back with the coffee bar. \u00a0My favourite seating place is at the bar just next to the stairs - it gives me perfect view of both the kitchen and coffee bar and is adequate for people watching. So, breaking down the rating here:i) \u00a0Coffee beans - 5*Ozone does fantastic single origin beans. \u00a0My recent favourite is the Ethopian Yirgacheffe which is a perfect balance between Peaberry-esque acidity and the darker choclatey notes. \u00a0They've drawn my business away from Monmouth and the coffee bar staff have been super helpful towards me whenever I've been there.ii) Coffee 4-4.5*I'm not a big fan of their house blend used for their espressos. The flavour is pleasant enough but seems to be lacking a little bit of depth. \u00a0The brewed coffee is great though (and, again, the coffee bar staff are very knowledgeable and helpful).iii) \u00a0Food 4*I love watching my food being cooked, it does add that extra something. \u00a0The menu is decent, several egg dishes, and an eclectic mix of various mains. \u00a0I've tried the omelette and the kedgeree here. \u00a0I love kedgeree, but this one was a bit different to what I'm used to. \u00a0Still tasty, mind. \u00a0The omelette was good, albeit overshadowed by the chips that I got. \u00a0I think their food needs a bit more salt overall, but I can't fault the quality of the food and the cooking. \u00a0I'm still more keen on the selection at Salvation Jane next door, but being able to watch the cooking and brewing is a big draw.iv) Service - WTF?Been here twice and the service has been haphazard both times. \u00a0One of the waitresses in particular made me feel sorry for existing...that is, if she even noticed that I was, in fact, a sentient being. \u00a0The other servers have been pleasant but quite slow and I've had to chase up my orders both times. \u00a0I dislike sycophant service, but being ignored is just unpleasant.Could be excellent if they sort themselves out. \u00a0The coffee beans are some of the best in London though.",

I could not help but oogle on ther peoples plate around.2. The ambiance here is relax and laid back. The Wooden benches and big glass walls makes it perfect to people watch in a cold and rainy London weather. I also like the bar stools facing the main kitchen which makes the dining experience fun and unique. The space in ozone is plentiful and uncramped while the decor is somewhat urban-industrial.3. The noise level is moderate. They play chill music in the background but still able to have conversation with and enjoy the solid good food. This place is perfect and much better choice to meet up with friends and conduct business.4. Friendly customer service. Our server and the servers we saw here are all welcoming, nice and efficient.5. Wifi! For those visiting London and wanting to take their work at a cafe, this is it.Too bad my husband and I are not coffee drinkers but I heard that they serve excellent Ethiopian coffee here.Overall, great spot for breakfast, to chill, work or meetings. Check it out.",

But I still have a lot of love for what the guys and girls at Ozone are doing. \u00a0 Their coffee is probably in my top three of roasters in the country - high praise indeed. Even better is that it's made within the industrial, New York looking building they call their home just around the corner from Old Street tube. \u00a0 This place can get busy, so if you're looking to eat here - which you should - try an early morning weekend trip or just after lunch on a week day. Honestly the breakfast selection is simple but inventive to keep it interesting & their selection of sandwiches and other lunch time picks are top notch without the pretension of some other coffee shops.",

We put it on our list and hoped we would make it there. \u00a0We barely made breakfast and I say that because toast and jam - I seem to recall - was listed on the menu as being served at certain times. Our servers brought me some anyway after we had our late brunch. Toast and AMAZING raspberry jam (which is what we always have at home but NOTHING like this) after a brunch and tea that almost left me in tears as it was. \u00a0I'm not a 'foodie.' But I do appreciate new experiences and a good meal. And honestly, I felt like weeping at the counter. \u00a0(Which was part of the experience by the way... watching people actually cook... Loved it!) Maybe I was hungover. Maybe I was sad I was leaving London soon. Or maybe it really was that great. I had also never appreciated tea for what it can be until my trip to London, and the way it was served at Ozone was all just part of the experience to this Texas gal. We have been searching for tea service like they had there so I can attempt to recreate it but Americans are far too simple for that apparently and we have so far found nothing even close. \u00a0Every where we ate on our trip was great but this is the one place I will look for again when we return. \u00a0And next time I'll take tissues with me.",
