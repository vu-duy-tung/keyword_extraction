Its going to be excellent area, with some great trees and a good vibe despite the construction around giving hints of brave new world of N London. We went late at night Friday and really enjoyed the wine and a great tasting pizza, also enjoyed the friendly helpful staff and buzzing atmosphere. The back of Caravan is full of sacks of coffee, too late at night to try the coffee so will have to be back.",

It didn't have enough of a punch til I added the s&p but after it was super good. The champagne with absinthe infused berries was good, the tofu and green beans had a nice sauce. The Dante's reserve was really sweet... Too sweet, the white negroni was too bitter for my taste. The service started fine but the wait staff changed and our second server ignored us for about 30 min at a time until the host came up and asked us if we needed anything at which point we mentioned that we'd been waiting for drinks for a while. He gave them to us on the house so that was nice.",

I fell in love with the handsome hipster baristas, high ceilings, exposed brickwork and delectable pastries. How have I never been here? It's like the Mothership. Basically this place is a middle class yuppie paradise. Hip, young things swigging coffee, talking about their polenta brunch choice and spending \u00a34.50 on an orange juice. Yes, we waited. We waited over half an hour, but it was brunch so what's the rush? We ordered a sweet muffin, which was kinda of like a cupcake-muffin, with frosting. Sourdough toast with avocado and sausage and a chorizo bake. Everything was good but next time I definitely want to try the waffles! I didn't find it over priced but maybe if I come back for dinner (yes, obviously I will) then I can try their small plates.",

No problem, we'll just go frolic in the fountains... wait, 24 year old women don't do that. We'll just go for a quick walk through the university bulidings and climb the viewing platform and do other things that adults do.. barely 15 minutes later, I got a text from Caravan informing us that our table was ready. Huzzah!I have a personal rule that if there's ever pork belly on a menu, no matter what the circumstances, I order the pork belly. Always. No exceptions. Turns out there's pork belly on this menu, with a kimchi pancake and a runny egg. And some creamy barbecue sauce and watercress garnish. Oh. My. Screw you, Caravan, for making the Asian chick start photographing her food again. Screw you and your beautiful, delicious brunch. You were everything my hangover was not.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in this because I'd read such great things about it.I went here last weekend with 2 girlfriend to have Sunday brunch. The sort of Sunday brunch where you talk for hours and generally set the world to right (only girls will understand how important it is to have these sessions. They should be mandatory).As you can't book a table, we put our names down and were told it would be a half hour wait. We came back half an hour later to find that we still couldn't be seated, and it was closer to the hour mark before we were. The place was packed. Absolutely rammed. We got started with some hair of the dog cocktails (again, mandatory) and browsed through the menus while discussing flower pressing and kittens and all other miscellanea that us ladies enjoy doing.I had informed the waiter when we sat down that I'm gluten-free, and he just said 'okay'. This proved to be an issue when we came to order as it turned out I had not been given the right menu - I had to be given another one and our order was subsequently delayed from being taken. Not great when you're starving hungry.The main issue with this place is the service. The waiters/waitresses were friendly enough, but they didn't seem to be assigned to a particular area - they all just kind of floated about at random, which meant that orders got confused and delayed. My friend asked for a side with her meal which arrived 10 minutes after the rest of the meal as the waiters kept forgetting it.The meal itself was okay. I had some sort of smoked salmon thing, which was nice but not very substantial. I was still hungry afterwards, as was one of my friends who had ordered the same as me. The other ordered some sort of Kimchi thingy, which she said was brilliant. I should have ordered something else, although I was limited due to my aforementioned, ridiculously annoying dietary requirements.For me, the real issue came when we asked for the dessert menu. It took us ages to flag down a waiter (one of us had to get up to grab one, in the end) and the lady nodded and walked off. She came back, chucked the bill down on the table and strode off. We were pretty annoyed by this as we had asked for the dessert menu, not the bill, and the attitude was just unwarranted.We decided to just pay the bill and leave. Another waitress came back over to sort us out, and we told her that we wanted the service charge taken off. We also explained what had just happened with the other waitress - she was mortified and brought us over some free desserts. Very nice of her, even though it wasn't her fault.On the whole, it's a really nice, funky place, and I'm sure when it's a bit quieter it provides a much better experience. That Sunday, however, was not one of those times. I won't be in a rush to go back, although I might give the other branch a try next time us ladies reconvene.",

We needed beer and sustinance. Ok I needed beer, he got tea and a snack. Normally I wouldn't bother writing a review for a meal that small, but I enjoyed the service, atmosphere and food so much that I'm giving these guys one. Maybe it's because when I was in university the food options were crap, but honestly it was a great place to eat in.The service was friendly and very attentive. Their locally brewed beer was tasty, the tea was lovely and their cookie was delicious. The atmosphere is really friendly, easy-going but still quite clean and crisp. It can be hard to find a new place that's inviting but still modern. I would definitely go back here for a proper meal!",

Three croquettes with a crispy exterior and fiery interior.Grilled quail, creamed sweetcorn, maple bacon (\u00a36.5) was a bit hard to eat, since it was a bit small, but still nicely grilled.Wish I could remember what the other dishes were but it was really nice to sit outside and soak the last of the summer days in.",

Everything we ate was good although the starters were the most creative and tasty.They seem to get inspiration from all over the culinary world, some Mexican and Southern Comfort food, Japanese and Italian. Everything was pretty tasty.We started with olives and curried nuts as well as jamon, finochiona, nduja and caperberries. Both were get starts to the meal and the nduja had just the right texture.We then had small plates to share: 1. a Quinoa and squash dish that served with med flavours with feta and peppers. It was very satisfying vegetarian dish.2. Spiced cauliflower, the charred cauliflower was nicely dressed with harissa and yoghurt3.Pan fried mackerel, an interesting dish with nori puree and diakon remoulade4. Crispy fried chicken with jerk mayo, the chicken wasn't that crispyThen we could choose a main course, our table tried all of them. \u00a0we had:1. orange teriyaki udon noodles-a bit too sweet2. Ancho pork fillet, nogada sauce-pork was cooked nicely3. Confit duck leg, cossoulet, the beans were undercooked but the confit duck was cooked perfectly4.mozzerella pizza-all the pizza are traditional thin crust made simply and well5.spinach, goat cheese and articoke pizza6. ham and tomato pizzaDessert:1.Affogato- they roast and grind their espresso in house and it shows2. Chocolate cheesecake-the almond ice cream and salted almonds were a nice balance to the creamy sweet cheesecake3.peanut butter parfait, a play on peanut butter and jelly that works.With such a large group there was a long delay between the starters and the main course but the service was some of the best we had in London with servers who actually checked in periodically to see if we needed more food or water, a rare thing in London.It's a very noisy space and the tables are close together. The atmosphere is London hipster. The place is wheelchair accessible as was the bathrooms but the narrow space between table could be a challenge.",

For starters the coconut lime chicken salad was light and refreshing. The soft shell crab really surprised me as it was not the usual from elsewhere, with an Indian influence. The smoked salmon dish should have just used raw salmon as the sauce made the dish too salty. Really loved the seared trout main, with strong and inventive Japanese flavours. One of the best fish dishes In my memory. And the crumble to end was divine.",

The building itself is really impressive and they have a great system in place to handle the constant queues where you are seated at the coffee/smoothie bar at the back while you wait for your table.What I didn't like about Caravan was the service. Our sever didn't mention the specials and our brunch arrived seconds after placing our order. This made me feel as if I was in a canteen being served slops and not paying top dollar for a flashy breakfast which I would expect to be made to order. Food was ok but not great and really didn't appreciate the gratuity being automatically added to our bill as we weren't happy with the service.",

Considering they do not take table bookings for brunch on weekends shows their popularity and confidence in attracting walk-in diners wishing to fill their stomachs with epic food. On queuing we were informed there would be an hour or more wait but the receptionist would notify our table of four as available via a callback through the phone. It was roughly about an hour's wait whilst we ventured to the neighbouring Grain Store (another great brunch place) and sat down for a tipple.On returning a call, we headed back and were shown to our alfresco seating, and luckily with the warm weather was a great place to breathe in fresh air and feel closer to the bustling market crowd at Granary Sq. We ordered four different breakfasts between us and the food quality was exceptional. Matching the smooth aroma of my cup of long black coffee, the taste of my Caravan Fry was as fresh as homemade farmhouse food, my only niggle was that they were so busy they ran out of field mushrooms. Still, this setback didn't ruin my experience and I would definitely come back here again.",

I guess in the summer you can use the great huge terrace, but for now it was inside. The decoration is great, a mix between old and new, a bit rough and industrial but still very cosy.For the food and coffee. Great coffee, and delicious food. Eggs or salads, or more sweet treats, it was all delicious. And I would advice going to see what they have as tarts, muffins, etc... For the service, very friendly and efficient (they'd better be, it's quite a big place)What was also nice, maybe for a next time in a smaller group, is to join the big tables they have.",

I fully intended to be original but I'm sorry I just can't help it, when I see a mention of avocado I just have to have it and so poached eggs on toast with a side of avocado were swiftly ordered by myself while Victoria went for the caravan fry with scrambled eggs.I won't lie the service was \u00a0pretty slow due to the fact that they were so busy but after our order had finally been taken the food arrived in no time at all and was quickly scoffed. My biggest gripe was that there was only a single solitary piece of toast which really wasn't enough to go around and especially not for the price I paid but the eggs were cooked to perfection and the avocado with its chilli kick was fantastic smooshed into the sourdough bread.",

I came twice for breakfast and had different items each time: the baked eggs and the classic breakfast with bacon and mushroom. Both were excellent choices. My colleagues sampled the pancakes with berries and marscapone cheese, the avocado toast, and the jalape\u00f1o cornbread and all were wonderful.",

There were only outside bar seats available and the promise of a table within 30 minutes. Luckily we were almost immediately moved to a table. The experience was generally good (fast seating, fantastic food, helpful wait-staff) although I it could be a little more speedy and friendly over all. We had a series of small plates and pizza's to share between us with cocktails. The beef carpaccio, burrata and margherita pizza were particularly memorable.I had one of the most amazing cocktails - I think it was the chef's special. It had popcorn in a teabag and was one of the most delicately, yet multidimensional flavoured cocktails I have ever had. Amazing! Sadly it wasn't the first of the evening so I can no longer remember the name! \u00a0This was my second visit and I will return again as it is in such a great location both for people watching when Granary Square is busy and being so close to King's Cross Station. The quality of the food makes this place good value for money.",

    "text": "I finally had a chance to visit Caravan Kings Cross last weekend. I was very excited about this place as everyone seems to love it, but to be honest, it kind of disappointed me. The building is amazing: an old warehouse converted into a trendy restaurant, long communal tables, open kitchen and the bar at the end. But it might be a bit too trendy and hisptery (understandable as Central Saint Martins is next door). Even the staff seemed to be 'too cool for school' and the one that served us, even though he was nice, I had the impression that he was mocking us because of our accent...Well, now onto the food. It was, as Yelp says 'A-OK'. Apparently it was still brunch time, so I ordered the Kimchi pancake with pork belly and eggs. And it was just ok and a bit overpriced. I have had better food for less money. The pork belly was mainly undercooked fat and the pancake was very fluffy.The best thing of my lunch was the coffee; pretty and tasty latte served at the right temperature.Maybe I need to be back for the legendary breakfast, but for now, that's it. Not a big fan, sorry.",

    "text": "I love this place.I've always been a huge fan of Caravan and now that they've opened one in college, it's especially hard not to drop in for a good meal after a hard day.Their jalapeno corn bread with chipotle butter is a good midday snack or slightly heavier starter. The bread's soft and moist and the butter's flavoursome and not too spicy. They only offer pizzas for takeaway, but if you want something simpler and less tomato-y the caramelised onion & parmesan pizza bread is a good option--and just \u00a34.50!The best thing about their small plates is that you get to try a bit of everything. They're also very balanced dishes--nice mixture of vegetables to compliment the meat/fish, and there's always a good variety of texture in each bite. The grits, smoked trout & seabass ceviche are my favourites, though the trout is quite rich after a while! The mackerel is delicious with its perfectly crispy skin and oily meat but somehow always too salty, so ask for less salt!As for desserts, you MUST try the butterscotch caramel pot with salted shortbread!! It sounds so rich and sinful, which it probably is, but not in the way you think. The caramel is actually quite bitter (in a burnt caramel kind of way) and it isn't too sweet. The shortbread is also deliberately over-salted so when eaten together, it becomes the perfect mix of sweet and salty. I just wish they'd give a bit more shortbread!The only downside to this place is that it's always crowded. There's always a queue even if it's just for weekday lunch, and on weekends it gets crazy!**Oh, and the cocktails are far too expensive to justify the tiny tiny glasses. Just go for the food.",

The staff was lovely and accommodating, though the 50p charge per person for filtered tap water was a bit weird. Eh, it's only 50p each, and it's for \"extra filtered water\" or something.

    "text": "So, I'm trying to find the words to describe this meal without being disrespectful. Dang, Caravan--you a tasty brunch*!When I went for dinner over the summer, my friend and I shared a smoked trout pizza, a burrata, and an absolutely inspired watermelon and tofu salad. This watermelon dish was a glorious reminder that even with the popularity of restaurants serving simple comfort food, there still is room for chefs to prove that they are way better than us at determining what flavors go well together.Somewhat conveniently located by King's Cross, Caravan is a great pre-train breakfast spot for commuters. It's not too crowded at 8.30, and it has free wifi. My friend and I shared a sumptuous smoked salmon and softly scrambled egg on thick sourdough, as well as a sweet and savory corn fritter thang with feta cubes laced with this really vibrant green stuff. We could not finish the last few bites, even though we had already been eating for taste for the few bites prior to our limits. I hate food waste, but I also hate taking trains feeling like I'm going to throw up. Add a real filter coffee (though about a third of an American small size), and we're off to a rip-roaring start.*I actually went for dinner and breakfast, but that wouldn't have worked as well in a David Guetta feat. Akon parody. I did go to brunch at Caravan's Exmouth Market location, and that was indeed a tasty brunch.",

    "text": "A cool, yummy place! My friends and came here on a Sunday morning to try their brunch. We came shortly after they opened to beat a line forming, and we were successfully seated right away. Even 20 minutes after opening though, Caravan was already getting very crowded!Caravan is in a cool location. A short walk north from St. Pancras leads you to a very nice, peaceful area with a cute little river and park vibe. Caravan itself is a huge spacious building with an industrial feel to it. The bathroom is a big part of this - AND they even have Aesop exfoliating hand wash and lotion! We were seated and got served water right away, and then we ordered our dishes - I got the Prawn and Chorizo Omelette. The food was pretty slow coming out, but all was forgiven when we saw how pretty the food was! My omelette had a huge bed of arugula and peppers on top. It was super filling and delicious! I was jealous of my friends kimchi pancake, however. I had a bite of hers and it was so yummy - especially with the pork and the sauce.The service was a bit unresponsive, as we were left pretty much alone after giving us our food. The music was also far too loud for my taste, and that mixed with a crowded restaurant made it very difficult to talk to my friends and hear the server. I would definitely sit outside next time. Another review stated that they were charged 50p for filtered tap water, but nothing like that happened to us - our water was free. Overall, great tasting food! I will try to be back in my short time left in London.",

    "text": "I can't rave about Caravan enough! As a student at Central Saint Martins, I usually pop in for their coffees. I recently had both breakfast and dinner there and would definitely keep going back.For breakfast we had the baked eggs, with tomato, chorizo and creme fraiche with \u00a0sourdough on the side. The tomatoes were slightly sour to offset the saltiness of the chorizo, and the eggs were a good carrier for all the flavours. For dinner we had 6 small plates--the smoked trout, mackerel, char-grilled pork, chorizo and sweet potato croquettes, seabass ceviche, and roasted quail. They were all phenomenal. The mackerel was a little too salty, but I feel like that's an anomaly. It sounds like a lot of meat but each dish came with a slightly small (but nicely so) portion of vegetables (you can see the fully descriptions of the dishes on their website). We also had the caramel butterscotch pots with shortbread. The caramel had a mousse-like texture and wasn't too sweet and tasted strongly of burnt sugar (in a good way), and the shortbread's deliberately saltier so they can be eaten together. The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, with lots of people dining after work. The interiors are very rustic but still polished and put together. You can tell there's a lot of attention to detail with the hand-stamped paper table cloths. Our bill (for 3) came up to \u00a370 without drinks.Highly highly recommended and I can't wait to go back again!",

I quite like the place - the space has that cool, warehouse conversion feel we're all going crazy over nowadays, and it's always buzzing with people. The menu offers interesting dishes, and they roast their own beans. Also, it's in the revamped Granary Square. You couldn't get much cooler than that, right?The problem comes in the price, for the most part. I've come for brunch a couple of times and thought the food, whether it's fritters or a variation of french toast, was tasty. The dishes are aromatic and good comfort food. But it really is just that. The portions are small and the taste a little too...rustic to justify the price. I've had a marvellous hot chocolate from their Clerkenwell location, but the coffee I've had here has not blown me away enough to get that 3.5 stars to 4.I would recommend Caravan on the basis that you will get some nice food in a very trendy place, but while I don't mind paying a little extra for good, solid food, I won't be coming back too often because I always feel a bit robbed after paying for a meal. But I won't object to another hot chocolate!",

Part of the new slew of urban restaurants to reach London, this restaurant serves great food in a casual atmosphere. Cute tapas style dining with cheerful staff, definitely try the deep fried duck egg with babaganoush, the grilled quail and super awesome desserts!

They are very proud of their coffee, as they should be. My cappuccino was delicious and by far the best part of my meal. I got baked eggs with chorizo - but honestly I couldn't taste the eggs. The chorizo was really strong and completely took over the dish. My friend order the scramble with bacon and fried oysters. It wasn't gross but it wasn't good. Maybe the chef was trying to be provocative... it came off as unnecessarily pretentious. Simple food done well would have been a better bet.",

    "text": "Caravan Kings Cross is hard to find, after dark in the slightly bleak and deserted Granary Square. But after a hasty phone call for directions, it was a warm, buzzy and friendly atmosphere, in a very hip sort of post-industrialist warehouse, all bare brick and exposed pipes and loos that looked as if the builders had wandered off the job half way through. The food, though... was perfect. We shared a ham hock terrine with crushed peas on soda bread to start (which maybe could have done with a wodge of cream cheese to moisten it up) but the bread was rich and dense, the terrine pleasingly chunky. I wolfed down the polenta with girolles and truffle oil - it was absolutely delicious, creamy and comforting, with a huge pile of wild mushrooms and a generous slick of the oil. My friend had the butternut squash chorizo croquettes which were light and fluffy, crisply fried, with a side of saffron aoili. We shared a really good baked cauliflower dish with melted smoked cheese and crunchy breadcrumbs. Desserts were equally good: I really wanted the apricot clafoutis but it was only available for two to share and it might have been just a bit greedy of me to scarf it down on my own. Especially after the polenta. But I was more than happy with the caramel pot with salted shortbread fingers: it was like a big cup of dulce de leche, smooth, buttery sweet and very, very rich, with the slight note of salt on the biscuits to cut it through. If I could have scraped any more off the inside of the cup, I would have. My friend made short work of her ginger treacle tart, with properly crisp pastry and big chunks of ginger in the mix. The brunch menu, I was reliably informed, is 'insane': those grits make an appearance, with wild boar sausages. As long as they have that caramel pud, it all sounds unmissable.",

    "text": "Check out my blog 'The Recipe Suitcase' for the whole review:recipe-suitcase.blogspot\u2026facebook.com/recipesuitc\u2026Type of Place: A little hipsterish, spacious place kept in a simple though stylish way. You can sit in or outside, although for outside the waiting time is slightly more (for inside I never had to wait). Waiters are really nice and easy going, but still professional and keen to explain everything to you, such as their varying coffee offers with beans from many different places. What I also like is that you can have a look straight into the kitchen and there is also a bar at the end of the really huge hall, serving Bloody Marys and other exciting types of drinks. It is a very modern place, but I wouldn't say it is only for young people. Although, it is a bit noisy here I think I would definitely take my parents here. Another great thing, which might seem a bit weird saying, is the lovely scrub-hand-soap they have in the restrooms and the matching hand lotion. Food and Drinks: I am a huge fan of the coffee here. Pure filter coffee..strong, with a bit of milk if you want some. They are served in fancy glasses, reminding of a chemistry laboratory, and they always have new or varying sorts of coffee beans. Food is great as well - sure, it has to be, otherwise this wouldn't be my favourite place. I recommend the poached eggs with aubergine puree, similar to the Romanian vinete and soutsouki sausage..it is great! Also, the baked egg is a go-for! Order it with the chorizo (unless you're vegetarian) and you'll fall in love with it. It is served in a casserole dish; on the bottom there is some kind of tomato ratatouille, topped with an egg, which slowly bakes in the oven leaving the egg yolk liquid, Greek yoghurt and chorizo. It is really delicious, believe me! \u00a0The jalape\u00f1o corn bread with fried eggs and black beans was also very good, but still my main recommendation are the two previous dishes. In addition, all savoury dishes are served with their fresh grain bread. I haven't tried the sweet things such as the waffles, the granola or the porridge but rumours has it it is also recommendable. Granola with apple rose compote sounds very promising indeed. The pastries and cakes are lovely as well to round off your 'Caravan' experience. Price: Nothing to complain about, good price value - coffee and brunch are around 13\u00a3 with tips.",

By this time it was almost 11pm and I was close to eating my arm. No bread was offered or anything else. I was only able to get one drink during the wait. When we tried to speak with any of the passing wait staff, they acted as if we were being the biggest pains and kept referring to our waiter saying that he would be coming by soon. Poor guy had too many tables and too many angry customers because I think everyone was waiting for their food. Our waiter was super apologetic and explained it was because there were a few large groups. Well, the venue is huge so they should expect groups. If the kitchen can't handle it then they shouldn't take group reservations. I liked the ambience and since I know very little about that area of London (hence have few alternatives up my sleeve), I might try them again, particularly since the food was good when it finally arrived. But on this occasion I was really let down. I felt bad that I had made the reservation here for my friend's last dinner in London.",

We planned our visit to arrive right as they opened doors at 10am, and when we got there, there was already a line outside. However, since we had gotten there as it opened, we got seated right away. I HIGHLY recommend getting to this restaurant as close to open as possible, as it filled up within 10 minutes of us being seated, and there was an hour wait after that. Anyways ... It was worth it! My husband got the jalepeno cornbread breakfast and loved it. It had a delicious and spicy corn salsa and a fried egg on top - so good! I got the muffin of the day, as well as the scrambled eggs on toast - really really good. The filter coffee was delicious and we are typically picky about that ;) This particular location is in a really cool spot of town! We wandered around Granary Square afterwards, where there was a cool vintage market going on. Definitely worth a visit!!",

Friends had frequently spoken excitedly about how wonderful the brunches were and yet how long the queues also constantly appeared to be. I'm not usually a person who likes to queue for my brunch as I am of the belief that there are enough stellar places in London that you simply don't have to. And also that a queue isn't usually indicative of good food but a buzz with tourists. Caravan dispels all of this!I have finally sat and brunched there and I can tell you that it is worth the wait. (Well, maybe up to an hour. Anything more than that is ridiculous for anywhere.) We arrived just before it opened and were sat immediately. I would say the worst thing about this place is being forced to choose what to have. We ordered : The cooked breakfastThe pumpkin waffleThe kimchee pancakes...and a lot of coffee. All were absolutely delicious. Some even surprisingly so. I have no idea what they do to those tomatoes but I was thinking about them all day after we left. If you are lucky enough to get a table for brunch then you are in for a treat! The service was impeccable and the prices more than reasonable. Wake up early one morning and treat yourself!",

I ordered a flat white which arrived quite promptly and was nice. The breakfast menu is slightly overwhelming and pretty confusing. Do I want warm coconut rice and mango chutney for breakfast? Is that a thing? Fortunately there are plenty of other options that are not, you know, that. I opted for aubergine puree with poached eggs, spicy sausage and sourdough toast. It was really tasty. Strong flavours, creamy aubergine, sausage just how I like it (salty, smoky, almost burnt) and poached eggs so perfect I might never bother eating them again. I may have reached peak poached egg in my life. Second complaint: They played Don't Stop Believin' and a number of other songs that just do not belong in a breakfast establishment. I get that this is presumably A Thing (a trendy thing) but it's really not great. I can think of a million other songs that would go so much better. Prices were steep for me but probably par for the course - so not a complaint. I would definitely come back here. It's conveniently located for non-locals and offering something a little bit special for that most important meal of the day.",

    "text": "This place is popular, really popular. We came for a Sunday brunch and were told it was almost a 2 hour wait. The other option was to hawk the bar and grab a seat when they came available. Not wanting to wait two hours we waited for a seat at the bar and after 10 mins a couple of stools became available. Waiting for a stool is pot luck, nobody is monitoring it so if someone comes in after you and grabs the next available space..... Tough luck!! The place is like a old ware house with functional tables, chairs and benches. It seats a lot of people but there are still massive ques. We ordered a couple of coffees while we checked out the menu and they were actually really good. It's a hot spot for Ausi's, which usually indicates the coffee will be half decent.The menu has a good amount of choices and I would have been happy with pretty much any of the options but opted for the jalipino cornflour bread with black beans and a fried egg. My wife went for a pumpkin waffle with fresh fruit.The food came out quickly..... Possibly a little too quick! But mine was good! Unfortunately my wife's was a bit on the salty side (salty waffles??!?!) We also had to ask for additional syrup as the amount it came with wasn't sufficient.Although the staff were very accommodating (think cool hipster sorts) there was a definite feeling of once you finished its time to leave and give up the seat.",

And another highlight-their bakeries and sandwiches. Try the mozzarella sandwich, exquisite.Crispy Pork belly was a slight disappointment, but who cares. Do go there before at 11:45am, as after 12:00(when they start serving lunch) the queues are getting enormous.",

I'm going to have to do some backtracking here since I'm way behind on reviews, but as my last meal in London, I came here for brunch. I know... :*****(Arrived around 10:30AM and didn't have to wait to be seated (YAY!). To start I had the Watermelon, Apple, Mint juice. I can't say I was a huge fan, it was just alright. Glancing over the menu, I decided upon the Corn fritters and all the other stuff it came with. Since it was missing some meat, I added some chorizo on the side. The chorizo is MONEY because it made this dish complete and utterly delicious.The place was buzzing and filled with Sunday brunchers. The menu isn't too big and don't expect normal breakfast offerings... Caravan puts their own twist on their dishes. I personally like this location more than the Exmouth Market one just because it's bigger and not as cramped. It's just outside King's Cross underground station for easy access as well.",

    "text": "Caravan's highly praised brunch menu has alluded me so far - so much to my own personal sadness I can't comment on the food. However, this is not for lack of trying. \u00a0 The waiting list on a weekend morning to get a table here is justification that all the amazing reviews this place gets are on point. If you want to eat brunch here, all I can say is set that alarm clock and make it there early otherwise you'll have quite the wait on your hands. \u00a0 The coffee - blended and roasted in the cafe/restaurant - is heavenly and I can happily say I'm a little addicted to Caravan's smooth bends. Their baristas really don't miss a trick and deliver the perfect cup each and every time. So even if you can't get yourself a table, don't leave without a coffee! \u00a0 UPDATE - I've finally eaten here!! We arrived just before doors opened at 10am, the line was right across the square, but we luckily got a spot at the communal table inside. I noticed it began to get quiet around 11/11:30am for a brief period too, so maybe take a risk around that time if you fancy a sleep in. \u00a0 As for breakfast food - it did not disappoint one bit. I had pumpkin waffles, which were an absolute light and fluffy dream. They also do the classic 'full brekkie' and an amazing looking Kim-chi, which my friend had, then raved about for hours afterwards.",

Somehow we came through the wrong door and seated ourselves, possibly skipping a queue (oops...we didn't mean to...). We immediately all commented on how much we liked the space - high ceilings, loads of light, attractive settings, all very promising. It was also notably pretty full, which at 3.30pm seemed quite impressive. I only had a coffee, so there's not loads to go on, but I was pretty disappointed - it was bitter, perhaps even burnt, so that rather took away from the experience. My friend's hot chocolate was apparently fine, but quite small for the price tag. My boyfriend ordered a dessert that turned out to be pretty much a scoop of mascarpone with cherries. Not terrible, but kind of odd and artless. If I go again, I'll update, as the menu did look enticing so the food might be worth a try.",

    "text": "Loved their brunch menu! Very much on the high end of 4 stars.Atmosphere:Exact sort of decor I love and one that fits a template. High ceilings, modern clean looking wooden tables and quite a bit of wood generally. Steel ish chairs with grey cushions. Slightly industrial look furthered by the existence of some exposed piping on the ceiling and brick walls (at least the entrance wall). And of course obligatory random vintage furnishings, in this case candlesticks in cool holders being the main thing.Queue:They don't take reservations for brunch and apparently the wait gets ridiculous. With this in mind we went at 1105 on a Saturday. We were seated immediately but it looked like we might have gotten lucky because it was already full and a queue started to form pretty much right after us. It was packed when we left at 1230 but if I had to guess, I'd say that as long as you get there by around 1130, the wait should be manageable.Food/drinks:Had the banana and vanilla smoothie which I loved. Unfortunately I drank it way too fast and at \u00a34.5 it felt a bit much to get another. Would have loved a slightly bigger glass but can't really complain.Beyond that, 3 of us shared everything we ordered. Namely:Raclette French toast with bacon and watercress - The French toast is essentially stuffed with cheese and topped with bacon. The cheese was served melting hot; gooey and delicious. Loved it but very much a 'thank god we shared' dish because it's just a bit too heavy and too cheesey.Aubergine puree with poached eggs and sourdough - As described really. Tasty dish. Their bread is particularly good.Berry waffles with mascarpone - not sure if this was crispy at the time it was served because we ate it last. Fortunately it was smothered in sauce so it wasn't that awkward kind of soggy but the whole hearted drenched in sauce awesome kind of soggy. Another great dish. Possibly a bit too sweet. Was really glad we effectively had it as dessert because it just doesn't really feel like a main.Bitter chocolate tart - Another good to share dish. It was a lovely tart but extremely dense. Wouldn't want to have a whole.Notes:Unisex toilets which is always a bit weird. They had exfoliating Aesop hand wash though so that was cool.Overall:Basically, pretty damn good.",

What an amazing building inside, lots of space and with seating outside too they must make an absolute killing at the weekend! It's really airy inside and definitely somewhere that you can relax and have a leisurely breakfast/lunch. I was greeted by a very smiley/friendly waitress and I ordered a Flat White straight away whilst I perused the menu. I'd heard amazing things about the coffee here so was really excited to try it! It arrived quickly but was luke warm and not as impressive as I thought it was going to be, shame.I then frustratingly waited around 25 minutes to order my breakfast whilst I watched the waitress serving everyone that had come in after me, frantically trying to get her attention. In the end I had to get up and go over and tell her that I was waiting to order. To be fair she looked horrified and said that she thought I had already ordered food....that was a bit frustrating as if she'd checked in to see if everything was ok then the problem would have been resolved a lot sooner. Anyway, that aside the food was incredible! I ordered the poached egg and avocado on toast which was HUGE and scrumptious. I also ordered a spicy wheatgrass juice shot with chili and coriander in which was AMAZING! I'll definitely be getting that when I return. And I will return very soon, forget the hiccup with the service this place rocks!",

I wanted to order EVERYTHING!- My brunch was really tasty - I tried the courgette and sweetcorn fritters- I like that they take your number and call you when you're table is ready. It meant we could chill in the sun by the canal and chat, instead of standing in a queue like the breakfast club. The less good:- Expect a wait...We arrived at 11:30 on a Saturday, and waited 45mins for a table...and then waited another 45mins for food. Service is slooooooow.- Staff were friendly, but it was hard to flag them down as they were so busy. I'm not sure how they managed to be so busy, and so slow at the same time. - Although the food tasted good, it was all cold. My friends waffle had absolutely no warmth...and mine was luke-warm. That was pretty disappointing after waiting for 1.5 hours!!I don't think I'd come back unless it was really early when maybe we'd have a chance of hot food.p.s. I just edited this three times because I can't decide between 2 or 3 stars...but I setted on two because I don't like paying \u00a320 for cold cooked brunch, even if it is tasty.",

I also felt extremely satisfied after, and must say that if you want value for money in this city, this is a must go! My friends, who had the baked eggs and jalape\u00f1o cornbread respectively, were also satisfied with the flavours and portion sizes. For those wanting a boozy brunch, Caravan also offers a nice selection of cocktails. A refreshing variety for brunch, combined with the airy and communal vibe, made my experience here a great one.",

    "text": "I was looking for a place for Brunch and a nice place to meet up with my friend in London and i found online this place, its located in a new area behind Kings Cross Station at Granary Square. Its about a 5 minute walk away from Kings Cross or St Pancras so its perfect before waiting for a train. Caravan Kings cross is in a converted Granary Building and the whole place was buzzing when i arrived. I wanted to sit outside and they said it would be a 20-25 minute wait as it was extremely busy, this was at 11am so he said for me to grab a coffee at the bar whilst i waited for the table and they also gave me a bag of coffee with a number on it and when the table was ready they would come and get us. So i waited around the bar and ordered my coffee and minutes later the table was ready. Great. So the nice lady took us to the table and asked us what drinks we wanted but we was already waiting for the coffees we ordered at the bar. Seconds later the coffees arrived with a big jug of water. My latte tasted amazing! A few minutes later the nice lady came to ask us what we would like for breakfast, i had poached eggs on Sour dough and it was delicious.i totally recommend this place to either sit inside or out, the whole place was really buzzing and had a great atmosphere to the place and the staff were really friendly.I cant wait to go back!",

Luckily, there was space on the large communal table at the back, behind the coffee bar. We were impressed by the space and quality of coffees. Unfortunately they had a power failure the night before we visited so for those of us who ordered tea, the milk that came with it was questionable. After going up to the bar twice, we managed to get some safer looking milk. The cakes and pastries got thumbs up all around, but a theme for Kings Cross (or the whole London in general it seems) is that you will not be getting value for money - a small portion (2-3 bites-full) of cake for \u00a32.50!From reading the other reviews on here, I think I'd get a better experience from dining so I'll be sure to re-visit and re-review!",

The food there is absolutely amazing. The best thing to do while at Caravan is to order all kinds of small plates and share them tapas style. The recipes are very creative as they blend all kinds of flavors from all over the world. Not your typical recipes but you will learn about all kinds of off the wall weird ingredients. This experience taught me a lot about food I had never heard of before. And every time I go back, the menu is different but as good as the previous time. Although small, the cocktails are very creative and oh so delish! And the deserts are out of this world. The restaurant's building is an old factory that was renovated into a trendy type setting. The negative part is that it is always loud so don't go there if you are hoping for a quiet meal. Service is generally good and the food comes out pretty fast. This restaurant is conveniently located near the King's Cross tube station and the cost is relatively good for the city. Oh and one more thing, make sure you go wash your hands in the restrooms. The A\u0113sop exfoliating hand soap and lotion will renew your hands and leave a scent that will delight your senses for hours to come! Enjoy!",

Menu is pretty extensive: small plates, starters, main, sides... There's a size for every stomach. I was pretty hungry and there was so many good things on the menu that I went for 2 small plates and 1 side. Spoiler alert: the plates are not small. I took the ham and cheese croquettas and the burrata with tomato relish with a side of corn bread (with real corn inside it, topped with melting better) and it was absolutely delicious.Service was fantastic: I had a train to catch and only had 45min to eat and they brought my plates in less than 5minutes. They were also super friendly and nice (they even did my coffee to take away so I could enjoy in the train)The place is a bit loud, especially at lunch time but it's mainly people talking about how good the food is.",

You can see everything at once, so that is why it is and looks crowded. We sat at the bar at the back and ordered drinks and plates to share. Everything was great from the octopus, to the burratta, not forgetting the artichoke salad, camember etc. Perfect. Nice staff, eclectic customer crowd, steps from King's Cross. This place is in a semi industrial building, next to the canal which gives you the possibility to get a nice walk after lunch/dinner.Will have to go back to try breakfast, lunch and dinner by ordering the full plates. Really recommend it.",

This sweet spot can, however, be hard to find. Please do not make the mistake I have made (multiple times). If you are coming out of Kings Cross Station it's quite easy, exit out the back (north) and there is a pathway that will run you directly into \"Granary Square\" where you'll see the UAL, Kings Cross Museum, etc -- nestled in this refurbished complex is Caravan, though the signs are not very loud. Also, I told my cab driver this morning \"Granary Square in N1\" -- which will end you in a weird residential block off Liverpool Road. The postcode here is N1C, my bad. Regardless...I finally made it, but do map the directions before endeavoring as its quite \"hidden\" by London standards. My taxi driver was baffled! I've eaten here on more than one occasion, dinner and breakfasts. It's a preferred breakfast spot as its quite centrally located (once you find it) to Kings Cross, and quite large to accommodate groups. This morning I enjoyed the jalapeno cornbread with fried egg and beans (the beans were woefully undercooked, if cooked at all?), plus a side of avocado, which was very nice and added quite a bit to the dish. It's an extra \u00a34 for that avocado though, sooooo about half the price of my entire dish. Seems, pricey. However, good. If dining in -- make a reservation. They do take away orders as well...plus a smaller coffee bar/shop with cakes and a few tables in the back near the roastery. If interested, order the coconut bread, rhubarb cake dish. I really wanted to, please tell me how it is! I will return for it. COCONUT BREAD? How did I not order it? I don't know. So, once you make it -- I think you'll quite like it. The service is always a bit standoffish, but fine enough...apparently that doesn't stop anyone from coming, as its always bustling and full of life.",

In fact Caravan manages to be all of these things and more.I went for dinner in a group of 4, and good job we booked in advance as the place was rammo. It still has that 'we're all friends here' vibe though, helped by the fact that they have a lot of long communal tables, and a really mixed crowd - great for people-watching yay :)The menu is unexpectedly interesting (more on this in a minute), and great for veggies (all 3 of my companions) and meat-eaters alike. We ordered a mix of small and large plates to share (always the best way) and got stuck in. Highlights included the jalapeno corn bread with chipotle butter and the blue cheese dish with figs and orange honey - see what I mean about interesting?! Slightly usual combinations that turned out oh so tasty. Ooh the butternut squash and pesto pizza was also yum, and I can't go without recommending a) you get dessert and b) try a cocktail - mine involved gin and blackberry jam and managed to erase its own name from my memory...try it though!The thus far unsung hero of the evening (and the main reason that bumped this up to 5-stars) was our server - a cute five-foot-something goateed hipster-spec-ed guy who was just so goddamn charmingly cool (or coolly charming?!) that you wanted to just keep on ordering stuff. Hmm well played, Caravan.Yes it's predictable in fulfilling that now well-known London equation: obscure industrial space + restaurant makeover = *hipster alert*, but it keeps a good amount of heart alongside that. I'll be back for sure (and hope for the same server..!).",

Didn't make sense to me why they would seat them right next to me when the entire table was open and they could've been seated at the other end but, hey. I don't run the place, I just love the food.

The atmosphere is the coolest thing about the place anyway. They transformed the old granary in a stylish fashion and it's a pleasure to just take in the space. Caravan is famous for their speciality coffee so I ordered a long black but it wasn't really to my taste - too sour and lemony for me. Even in the soy cap I had later on, that strong aroma still kinda bothered me. But I'm not questioning the quality of the coffee!I shared the avocado on sourdough and the quinoa dish with my friend. The latter was spiced interestingly and I didn't dislike it but it also wasn't particularly amazing as a dish.I still feel like I'd come back for the food and above all for the ambience.",

You will get the disclaimer if you would like to sit outside that you will not be moved inside if it starts raining (no matter the amount of empty tables are inside). But if you can, sit outside and enjoy the people watch. It is a bit of a windy spot so fingers crossed you don't get a crowd of smokers outside the eating area blowing ash on you.The food is ok. It is a little on the pricey side for what they are putting out. Breakfast finishes at 11:30 mid week then it is a pizza or small plates menu. I don't love the menu but there are some good things on offer but they're not quite there. And if you are ordering a couple of the small dishes to share (recommended) then you need to consider which flavours will go together because I don't think they all go. Wine list by the glass especially for whites (and there is about 7) needs a review. They are all in a similar flavour spectrum: lighter, acidic, non oaked, probably a touch mineral or herbacious. Would love to see one aged white or a fuller bodied something. If I come here again it will be for a bottle of wine (not glass) with selections from the cheese and meats menu. Goats cheese and nuts and honey was amazing. You will need to order bread to go with it and pay extra though.",

They took our number and we ordered a coffee to go and sat outside in their outdoors seating and chatted/ played cards til they called us (we were in no rush) but just be warned on the weekends you're going to have to wait to get a table!While we waited we looked at the menu so we knew exactly what we were going to get when we sat down! Exactly 45 minutes later they rang us so we dashed inside and were seated right away!As there was so much on the menu to try we decided to share everything and get one dish at a time. To start we ordered the kimchee pork belly pancake which was sooo good! Pork was delicious and full of flavours. Pancake isn't so pancakey but tasty all the same. I couldn't have eaten the whole thing though! We also ordered the apricot mimosas which were good but nothing amazing! Next up was the pumpkin waffle with ricotta, peppers, pecans and maple syrup. I thought this dish was going to more of a sweet dish but it was actually savoury! Interesting flavours and worth trying but again couldn't eat the whole thing. Finally we had the coconut bread with lemon curd and strawberries! My favourite by far! Would definitely have again to myself! Overall had a lovely brunch - the waitress was very friendly and we weren't rushed at all! Will definitely be back for brunch but looking to try the bbq beans and the baked eggs next time!",

    "text": "For a fun night out with great food and an interesting location, check out Caravan. Make sure you get there before you're ready to eat because there's a good chance you'll have a wait! We rolled up around 8 and didn't get a table until 9. Having put our names down, we grabbed out number -- a bag of coffee beans! -- and headed to the bar. There's a great selection of spirits and beers. Drink in hand, it's off to sit and wait. The outside waiting area has a lot of seats with tables, benches around the edge -- plenty of room to hang out and catch up with friends I haven't seen in almost 2 years. \u00a0Eventually we got called inside to our table. It's loud but not deafening, lit well enough to actually read the menu, and filled with ecclectic character. And then we got a look at the menu. OMG, talk about drool-worthy! With a bit of discussion we decided to go with a selection of small plates...and some potato bread. Washed down with a tasty bottle of red. Everything was beautifully presented, still hot, and filled with flavour. We had room for dessert -- some panna cotta, ice cream... and a cheese platter with yummy quince jam! And a bottle of sauterne to enhance it all.There was nothing to complain about -- service was friendly and good, the food was incredible, and the atmosphere fun. Definitely a place to return to next time I'm in London",

    "text": "Brunch here was fire . And the wait staff were perfection - particularly the tall, African American ex-model with the vibrant personality and sense of humor. She made the meal so much better with her recommendations and stories to share. We came here for brunch on a Sunday I believe and it was so lovely. The queue was shorter than anticipated and we went through the line quickly. If you don't want to wait in line, you can always book ahead as well. We started with drinks of course - might I suggest the blueberry & tarragon shrub, as well as the morning G&T. Don't order the Bloody Mary however, as it's pre-mixed the night before to save time, which doesn't really make for the best morning cocktail. For our mains, we ordered the crushed potato mung Dahl and the fried cornbread. Both were marvelous and I LOVED the side of pork & leek sausage. This restaurant is not meant for you to come in and order avocado toast. Be adventurous and try something special that Caravan has created. Looking forward to trying dinner here in the future!",

The menu is creative and everything we tried was done really well!This may be weird to say, but I just started eating avocados in the last year or two. But they're in every dish -- all over the world. It became the new salt so...I finally gave in. And... they're not so bad. I had the best guacamole here :) It came with the fried eggs over jalapeno cornbread and black beans. This was an awesome dish and a combination I had not had before. Note: Smoked salmon on menus in London are different than we think it is in the Pacific Northwest. Smoked salmon here is brined (raw) like lox, while at home, it's cooked via smoking. I like both preparations equally, but with just-cooked scrambled eggs like at Caravan's? The raw version is the perfect complement. Drip coffee is served in beaker, pretty cute but drink it fast before it cools off ;) And try one of the juices! I recommend the carrot apple ginger with tamarind.",

Waiters are super friendly and efficient despite it being a very busy Wednesday evening.I had the pan friend mackerel, jersey royals and garam masala mayonnaise. This was delicious! But be warned - the portion is TINY (more like what you would expect from a starter). My friend had the crispy chilli salt tofu - again just one chunk of tofu. So if you're going with a good appetite, you will definitely need more than one main dish (or get a starter, main and dessert). For the pudding we had the coconut panna cotta. I'm not a huge fan of panna cotta to start with, but after a few bites of this I stopped. The vanilla ice cream with the espresso caramel sauce was delicious! Would recommend. Overall:Food is yummy and the restaurant has a great vibe, but be aware that the portions are small - I overhead people on tables next to us commenting on this as well so it's not just me!Service - fantastic.",

Jalape\u00f1o corn bread, chipotle butter (spicy) - \u00a34I'd skip the pizza and the Burmese chicken salad, wasn't my favorite. However the pork is super! It comes in a small plate (to share) but I'd probably just keep it to myself. The croquette and jalape\u00f1o bread was interesting though. I liked the grilled asparagus, again I wouldn't share it with anyone if I were you.Good portion here (other than the pizza) is small - whatever we ordered were starters and small plate sizes to share, it would enough for two, maybe not three.Our bill came up to \u00a366 including drinks for 3pax. I'd say it's reasonable. Nice place to hang and read a book or just chill.",

Once we were seated, service was quick and pleasant. The environment was very busy, but it wasn't too loud to have a good conversation! I had the jalape\u00f1o cornbread avocado toast, which was absolutely delicious, as well as a pot of rooibos tea. The toast came with two sunny side up eggs, and was more than enough for me! My friend got the coconut pancake and also though it was tasty. We both paid 16 pounds, which was on the pricey end for a non-alcoholic brunch, but definitely a yummy treat!One star deducted because I think our server forgot about us, and we waited 30 minutes for the check",

The staff on both occasions were super on point, and despite the large crowds we were seated and fed with a quickness. Our first visit was for breakfast during the week, and we shared some scones, poached eggs, and some kind of heavenly lemon coconut bread + coffee drinks. We had to pack up some of it for takeaway (granted we don't typically eat large portions... but rather we snack all day like peckish foxes). The second visit was near the end of a weekend brunch service on a terribly hot day. Despite the heat and it being near closing our server was funny, sweet, and helpful, and the food service was just as quick. My better half had the sweet porridge, I had a grain bowl, and our friend had a crawfish salad (I think?), plus juices. Another great meal! We will definitely be back when we pop over again.",

    "text": "Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES... Was my first thought when we arrived bright and early this Saturday morning! Caravan has been on my brunch hit list for so long now and I finally discovered the answer of being able to get a table - get your arse out of bed on a Saturday! We arrived and were third in the queue, the queue that by opening time ten minutes later was around the block! The doors opened and we were kindly shown to our table! (The third table to be seated - YEY). We were soon greeted by a friendly American waitress who offered up some water. We were waiting for a friend so this was a very casual affair (she was 45 minutes late) but the waitress never batted an eye lid and allowed us to order at out leisure despite the place obviously becoming rammed! First we ordered a fruit scone and a round of toast and jam for starters (brunch starters are now a thing). They arrived quickly. The toast was thick slices of grain bread (as requested) with a pot of butter, fresh raspberry jam and marmalade! The raspberry jam was to die for and complimented the grain toast and butter deliciously! Who knew toast could taste this good. The scone then arrived and WOW what a scone - it was huge! We thought it was burned at first but, of course, it wasn't! It was freshly baked, and beautifully soft and buttery in the middle! We slapped on that jam and tucked in with traditional English flair!And now to the main event! I hadn't had avocado for a while and I couldn't wait to try pretty much everything on the menu that went on it or with it so I had the avocado with chilli on toast with a poached egg and sides of streaky bacon and mushrooms. NOM.One thing I must point out at this stage is Caravan know what their doing, their food comes out fast and fresh and the door is ever revolving with new customers when and where possible. It's an art and they nail it.Our mass order arrived quickly and my oh my was it worth the wait. Another slice of grain toast stacked high with delicious fresh and chunky avocado and chilli flakes - an avodream! The poached egg was cooked to perfection and when you combined it with the crispy salty streaky bacon and mushrooms I hate a brunch fit for a queen! I won't lie, I ate every mouthful and I'm not ashamed! It was just wonderful and everyone else agreed! The coffees are also made and served fresh and are apparently fantastic!Go there, get out of bed on a Saturday morning and go! It's worth your alarm going off, trust me!",

    "text": "This was our third visit to this branch of Caravan and the experience was very similar each time. Be prepared to queue for two reasons. Firstly, this place is popular, particularly at weekend lunchtimes. Secondly, they struggle to match diners to tables, so you often have people waiting at the bar and by the door while there are loads of empty tables and no sign of customers with bookings to take them.The best thing about Caravan - both in King's Cross and Exmouth Market - is the food. In my experience they get it right every time. The small plates and side dishes are delicious. I shared the avocado on sourdough, which I love (all of their toast dishes are great) and had the breaded salt beef dish with poached eggs, spinach and hollandaise. This dish is outstanding and is the star of the King's Cross branch. It is well-prepared and well seasoned, filling without being too heavy and the hollandaise is just the right balance of tangy, buttery and rich.We were (eventually) seated near the kitchen and it was great to see it in action. It is really efficient and our order was delivered in lightning speed once we had placed it. If only the rest of the place were so well organised.What lets the place down is its noticeable inefficiency, particularly when it comes to the bar. The first time we came here, we ordered drinks while waiting at the bar and they were delivered 45 minutes later at the table after we had finished eating and only after we had reminded them about 5 times. This time around, we ordered drinks at the bar - a bloody mary and a fresh lemonade. The guy who took our order typed it into the computer and then proceeded to unload the dishwasher. Another two barman came to try to take our order in the next few minutes, but nobody seemed to actually be making the drinks (the bloody mary was prepared on the other side of the bar, but the ratio of people making drinks to taking orders seems to be wrong). The bloody mary was delivered 10 minutes later (nice by the way) and at that point, the barman in front of us started assembling the lemonade.When we finished eating, we ordered coffee to go. This also took a long time to arrive and when it did, they didn't bring the bill, which we then had to ask for twice (I'm not sure why they didn't make the connection between the coffee to go and bringing us the bill). As we paid and got ready to leave, the couple beside us, who had paid their bill at the time we placed our coffee order, reminded the waitress that they too had ordered coffee to go. So lots of customers are sitting around waiting to leave while a huge queue of people are sitting and standing around waiting for tables.In short, if this place could be a bit better organised, it would be outstanding (it would probably also be able to accommodate a lot more customers). It is definitely worth the visit to sample the excellent food, but make sure you have the time to spend.",

We had to wait a little for the table, but had a drink at the bar, so no biggy.The food was lovely - particular highlights were the chorizo & sweet potato croquettes, wasabi oysters, cornbread and the grits although it was all good. I'd recommend ordering in batches otherwise you can get carried away and end up with more food than you can handle!One note though - it's a nightmare to find. If you're walking from Kings Cross, take the second left after the canal (not the first as apple maps would suggest) and walk through the arts college to get there. It's worth the trek once you find it though! I'm very keen to try the other branch in angel and everything else from the menu",

Had massive food envy by opting for pizza as opposed to sampling the small plates on offer, but still, the pizza was still fantastic. Sampled some of the girlfriends deep fried duck egg with chorizo however, and oh my, I was lost in my food heaven. Both opted for an apple juice, and we were fairly sure the ingredients would have been hanging on the tree still this very morning. So fresh! Coffee to finish and all in all, a superb lunch spot. Easily take a client, date or your mother.Even at lunch time in this pretty quiet part of town, the place was buzzing and almost full. Highly recommend ringing ahead to book a table. If you're not sure, look for the water fountains in front of the restaurant, on the St Pancras side of The Filling Station! Also does take away!Will be back!",

    "text": "Definitely one of my favourite spots for a weekend brunch in London, especially in the winter. For the summer season, I think I'd still enjoy Caravan on Exmouth Market... which has some nice outdoor seating so one can soak in what little of the London summer sun one can get....But, I came to Caravan's Kings X in the winter, and I've made it a regular haunting ground, meeting with friends from the media and pr industry. It's a big place, much bigger than Exmouth Market, with tons of seating. The waiting area at the bar is great, and there is good wifi, and really good flat whites while you wait for a seat. Seating is very communal for the most part... a bit like the original 'Pain Quotidien'... and the warehouse feel is so urban derelict cool.I usually go for the bloody mary, which I enjoy, especially when I request and get it spicy... with a bit of kick. For breakfast, I'd recommend the baked eggs with chorizo sausage... a classic that can also be found in Exmouth, and is always a sure fire winner. Always fun to share this dish, and order a side of chili, avocado on sour dough bread.The brownie is to die for. If you want to die of a heart attack that is.All in all, cool place, gets pretty busy on the weekends, but i've never had to wait more than 15-20m. Well worth it.",

The cauliflower was the stand out dish. The pork belly was good because of the accompaniments but not crispy as described which is the most important thing about the dish. We agreed when seated that we would have to be finished within 45 minutes because of another booking which was absolutely fine except that it took a while for someone to take our order and then the manager was abrupt about us moving with 4 minutes to go. It worked out because we could sit in the shared space but I think he could have handled it with more finesse given we were paying customers and happy to accommodate. So not the best service but overall a great experience and a special mention for the Kiwi host who was an absolute sweetheart! Will definitely return.",

    "text": "As a big fan of the Exmouth Market original I was slightly taken aback at the sheer size of Caravan's King's Cross iteration. It was certainly popular enough to justify the size; only 45 minutes after opening it was already fairly crowded with a bunch of brunch hungry patrons. Scaling a restaurant up to fill a bigger venue must be a difficult job and it is impressive that the original venture's charm is carried into this new iteration. Much of this is to do with the staff who are just as friendly and engaging as ever. It also helps that the coffee (made with in house roasted beans) is also still great. What hasn't worked so well is the food. In particular, the smoked haddock rarebit was very disappointing, the rarebit element completely lacking in punch and flavour. My Parmesan grits and boar sausage was better although once the sausage had been devoured the dish lost balance and texture. It needed either more sausage or less grits.These are relatively minor gripes and I hope they are remedied because the King's Cross area is still relatively short of good restaurant options for the hungry traveller.",

    "text": "I finally got around to trying the King's Cross branch of Caravan over the weekend. As much as I love the other Caravan, I was curious about this one because a) it's bigger and b) it's quite easy to get to for me from the train station.So a few of us ventured here. And even though it's bigger, we were still told there was going to be a 40 minute wait. Luckily, that was only 20 minutes and we sat down to eat. We were sat at a communal table, so be aware that while there are quite a few tables for two or four, there are larger communal tables that you may end up at.Drinks-wise I had filter coffee, which as the other location they do as well. We also had quite a few of the smoke tomato and beef bloody Marys. They are very spicy and quite tasty, but not the best I've had in London. There was a bit of something missing, not sure what, but I'd definitely have more of them.For mains I had the jalapeno cornbread with eggs. Other dishes at the table were the Raclette French Toast, the full English and a crab omelette. I think mine was the least interesting. The cornbread was kind of bland and the texture was just wrong. We did order a side of chorizo which went okay with it. The crab omelette though was a triumph. I took one bite of it and knew I made a mistake with my order. The raclette french toast was also pretty amazing, but a lot richer and heavier than the omelette. I also tried the pumpkin, goat cheese and pine nut muffin which was tasty. We tried a peanut butter cookie, but I can make and have several better recipes.So all in all, I had a good time. Is it better than the original? Unfortunately not. The food is different, and maybe not quite as good. The venue is big and really loud and lost quite a bit of intimacy the original venue has. It doesn't mean I won't go back to this one, as the location is much easier, but the Exmouth branch really has the slight edge for me.",

The decor is modern cool and the atmosphere is fun, although a couple of years on, the style is not as bang on trend as it was. Seeing the kitchen from the restaurant is great there is a real creative feel about what they do. Average age is early thirties, people in their early twenties did not seem to get as much out of it, some people were in their fifties but they were a minority. The service was good, but when on a table there was the feeling of getting an allocated waiter or waitress for that set of tables. \u00a0Other servers did not really want to do tables outside their area. \u00a0Most of the staff are warm, \u00a0hospitable and friendly, but sadly a quarter are a bit standofishAlso the second time we came, \u00a0we did have to wait about 20 minutes for the table after the time it had been pretty booked for.

People were waiting for upwards to an hour and a half for tables on my Sunday morning visit. I opted for immediate seating at the bar - and then spent the next hour and a half either trying desperately to catch the attention of the disinterested bar staff or eating awkwardly with my legs askew to the not-at-all-accommodating bar whilst what seemed like five million yuppie parents wheeled their prams awfully close to my feet which I was forced to dangle precariously in the cramped walkway to the communal toilets.Worse still, the coffee was average, the food was just OK, and I didn't even finish my bloody mary. Which is shameful.And no thanks to the communal toilet. I'm a progressive, feminist woman and all, but I don't even like ladies hearing my bathroom business at the best of times.

I always enjoy the food when I go, today was no exception, however, I think after this visit, I won't be in a hurry to go back. There is something about Caravan that oozes \"Too cool for school\". When my friend and I walked in today for lunch, we waited to be seated. Fair enough. What wasn't fair enough was that we weren't even acknowledged. Admittedly the Ma\u00eetre D was with someone else, but there was no nod or any indication that he would be with us shortly, even when I directly made eye contact. When he finished with the person he was serving, he didn't address us immediately, he just let us loiter in the doorway, awkwardly waiting for a table before casually asking what we wanted. Once seated, we were attended to well enough, our server took our order, no problems. Our small dishes started arriving and they were perfect. My favourite was the ash goats cheese and the inari tofu. Delicious. However, as we were eating our meal, the same dishes that we clearly already had on our table arrived again. This is the second time this has happened to me at Caravan. We finished our meal without incident, as I said, it was delicious and we ordered two coffees to go as we wanted to walk along the canals. While we waited for our coffees, the check also came out. When our coffees arrived, we had the money and a card ready to pay. We waited, we waited, still no one came. This was until we flagged someone down who said they would get someone to deal with it. All of this would have been fine, but what really made the experience less than impressive was that as I was waiting for my friend to return from the bathroom so we could leave, a waitress came up to me and told me that they would need the table back. I looked at her incredulously as clearly we had paid, we had takeaway coffees because we wanted to go and I was obviously waiting for my friend who was in the bathroom. If they had told me before we sat down they needed the table back at a specific time, no problems, but there was no conditions to us being seated. Furthermore, if they had wanted us to leave, they should have taken the money we had sitting on the table for 15 minutes so that we could actually leave. The waitress quickly tried to backtrack and said that they would need it in 5 minutes, but either way, no one appreciates being rushed out of a restaurant. I understand that you want to do more covers, but seriously, that is just downright rude. The only reason Caravan gets 3 stars is the food. I want to give it 2 stars, but the food is just too good.",

    "text": "I have never been this badly treated from the minute I walked into a restaurant. Went to Caravan today at 1.30 pm after hearing good things from a few friends and seeing great ratings on Yelp. The restaurant has a weird system of giving you a pack of coffee beans with a number on it, and then coming to find you when your number comes up in their system. That's fine, but it becomes pretty easy to say \"we tried to find you, but couldn't.\" Anyway, we were told it would be a 40-50 min wait despite seeing several free tables when we walked in. We waited at the bar with our numbered bag of coffee beans clearly in sight. After 40 mins, I went back to the two hostesses (who, may I add were EXTREMELY RUDE and snooty) and they said it had \"only been 39 minutes\" and we would need to wait \"another 20 mins at least.\" I told her that the table for 3 that had been empty 40 mins ago was still empty (as were plenty of other tables), but for some reason she said she couldn't seat us as there were others in line (????). I told her we didn't want to wait anymore and left. She chased us out of the restaurant and very rudely said, \"you need to close out your tab at the bar.\" I told her we'd already done it. She said it wasn't in the system and she would need to see a receipt. All of this was done loudly (and rudely) in front of the diners sitting outside. We showed her the receipt and she briskly said thanks and quickly went inside. No apologies offered at all. In short, I don't care whether their omelette tastes like heaven in my mouth, I'm never going back to this place or recommending it to anyone else. Save your time and dignity and go to any of the hundreds of other great brunch spots in London.",

    "text": "There's this thing that's taken over the London food scene: Small plates to be shared over (usually good) alcohol. Caravan sits in that category comfortably.Turned up on a Saturday night with four friends without a reservation. We were advised we'd have to wait for 45 minutes but by the time we sat at the bar our table was ready. That was efficient.So we managed to sat down and got ourselves some drinks. They made my Gibson martini properly and I was surprised it was so good and with a normal price tag. I've tried another cocktail - something Earl Gray that was delicious.Food-wise it got a bit complicated. We went for a range of small dishes and then finished it off with a main each. I must admit though that their small dishes are smaller than expected! Their asparagus with some red sauce seemed nice, albeit a bit charred. Also - 3 asparagus was not a satisfactory quantity.The scallop carpaccio with bean sprouts was impressive though it was hard to stomach the use of popcorn in such a dish. It seemed as it was intentionally put there to make the dish seem fusion. Their fried chicken came in the form of 3 croquettes that tasted pretty good (how can fried chicken go wrong?).The small plate highlight was the stuffed courgette flower with chipotle ricotta. It was brilliant in every sense, heavy and bold. We've also tried fried cauliflower balls (nothing special), prawns over some red sauce and a couple other plates that I forgot about. Again, these were good but they were really small on the quanity. Our waiter advised us that one would need 2-3 small plates or a large one to eat enough. Had I listened to him, I could see myself eating a dodgy kebab on the way home.The large plates were pretty much satisfactory, quantity-wise and with good prices. I ordered the welsh lamb that had ran out by then so switched it to a pork chop. The pork chop was very well cooked, however I found the addition of cooked apricots a bit unappetising. My friend's pollock dish smelt very good and it seemed like it was a well made dish.Their serving time was adequate, however this was dealt with as they cook the food fresh and as you order.It's a nice place. I might return but under different circumstances. I can see it as a bit of a romanticky date kind of place. Bit loud but with well thought of and polished edges.",

    "text": "Came to Caravan after work one evening, hidden behind Kings Cross station the place itself seems unfinished adopting a chic warehouse style food hall. \u00a0Its in an old granary store afterall so retains part of that feel. \u00a0The whole area is being regenerated and Kings Cross as a whole will be awash soon with bars and places to eat. This place will be at the heart.The menu a variety of pizzas and sharing style foods looked interesting. \u00a0I went simple with a chorizo and goats cheese pizza. Yum. And can say great service (thanks Chloe), who made us very welcome with attentive service, the pizza wasn't half bad either.This appears more of a breakfast/brunch place so will be back to try. Also can definitely recommend for an evening bite or meeting place on way home from work.",

    "text": "We came here for a brunch catch up with some friends that we hadn't seen for a while. \u00a0It is a busy place, but not too noisy. \u00a0There is an attractive selection of brunch options and a good drinks menu. \u00a0At the busiest times, though, you need to be prepared to wait for a table.We had a round of drinks while we were perusing the menu. \u00a0My wife had a coffee which she enjoyed, and I had a banana smoothie (more because it was such a hot day!)Two of us ordered french toast, another had the cured salmon and I had the baked eggs chorizo. \u00a0Three of our dishes arrived in a reasonable time, but the 4th was missing. \u00a0After waiting for a while and wondering what the story was, we let the waitress know and she checked with the kitchen. \u00a0I think they had just forgotten it. \u00a0Of course, no-one was starting their meal until everyone had their's, so we were all getting a bit hungry. \u00a0When the cured salmon dish finally arrived, it was the least-impressive looking of the lot.I was happy with my meal: the tomatoes went well with the chorizo and I mopped up the sauce with the toast. \u00a0I got to have a slice of the french toast and I enjoyed that too.My 3-star rating is driven by the long delay in getting our last meal. \u00a0If it were based on the quality of the food and drinks, then I may have been pushed to give 4 stars.",
