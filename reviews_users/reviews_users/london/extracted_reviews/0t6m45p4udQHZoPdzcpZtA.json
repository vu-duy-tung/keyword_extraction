    "text": "Popular with students, young Islingtonians and couples, Mem & Laz (not sure about the name either) has a lively, busy atmosphere - it's probably best to get a table downstairs as upstairs is a bit too cramped. The broad range of Turkish-based Mediterranean cuisine (plus pizza) comes at very reasonable prices, especially for lunch, but is still more affordable than many of the neighbouring eateries in the evenings.The interior decoration is, as ever, hard to assess objectively - some would call it creative Mediterranean clutter, I might not be so kind, but either way it fits with the casual, lantern lit, relaxed atmosphere. The service is maybe a bit too relaxed at times, but it seems to be a conscious philosophy of the venue so again it works. Overall the food is good enough, and the menu is good value and diverse enough to keep people coming back.",

Not that anyone minds, London is a big mesh of cultures anyway.I went with a party of six and general consensus was, in between stuffed mouths of lamb, white bait and salads, \" tasty\", \"good\" and \"not bad\". The place was packed and quite noisy. I'm not sure if I would like to come here on a date - just in case you're asking - but it's a good crown pleaser place.Decor? What are those hanging lanterny things? mmm, just as the food; good and not bad but certainly no contender for design of the month.",

Unfortunately I contracted some serious stomach problems (was definitely the restaurant, due to timing and other food that day \u00a0had only eaten cereal and an M&S sandwich). Took me nearly two hours to get home as was really ill in station toilets etc. So, I contacted the restaurant with a fairly humorous email expecting a note to say sorry and pop in for a free drink, or similar. What I got back was a note from the manager essentially blaming me, my system and the hot weather As it is very hot weather maybe food idi not agree with your system. Interestingly I had provided a list of the food I had ordered, in his email he immediately homed in on the Tuna \u00a0giving lots of reasons why it is fresh etc. Personally I thought it would be more likely that I picked something up from a salad, tossed with unwashed hands? So why home in on the tuna like this.? As I say, it looks a nice restaurant but I will not be going back due to the patronising attitude and blame avoidance of the manager. Following me posting a review as to the restaurant's response to my email describing my food poisoning(as per my previous review) i got this email from the owner: We are to busy to spend time in front of computer sir we are more dedicated to customer service and good quality food so we are serving more 5000 people a week in this street so enjoy your sad life Kind regards mem\" Nice response! I shall enjoy my 'sad life' at other restuarants in future.",

In summer time there are tables lining the street outside and it's great to sit in the sunshine, eat well and watch the world go by. At this time of year inside is cosy and welcoming, if a little packed downstairs (they have crammed in as many tables as possible, so expect a bit of chair banging as you try and get a table). There's a room upstairs which is also available to book privately for groups. Food wise I've never been disappointed. It's good value, delicious food - the sardines are great, and you're give a good-sized portion! Service is friendly, polite and there's an upbeat atmosphere about the place.",

The atmosphere is always good and the place is always busy. The seating arrangements mean that they really cram you in, but once you realise everyone is having a good time, you don't mind. The beer is good. There's a good selection of wine. And the food was lovely. I had lamb cutlets for a main the last time I went, and they were delicious. Worth going back for, which I will be doing very soon. A very good alternative to Gallipoli.",

I for one surely wouldn't ever have gone in if it had not been for the recommendation of a friend staying around there.It was Angel right ? But as soon as i went in, its not Angel anymore. The ambience reminds me more of Covent garden or mid-town manhattan. The theatre posters (old and new), the noise, the music ... everything. Its different from the other places around ... and i am sure others think so too. It was the only establishment in that alley that was crowded that sunday evening.I have been to quite a few turkish places in London. I would rank the hummus here at among the very best. Too bad they charge for it :(I had the grilled mediterranean kofta, served with rice and salad. It was very good, and it was made better by the extraordinary chilly sauce. I absolutely loved it. My friend ordered the Filo parcels - parcels of feta cheese served with grated parmesan, sour cream and salad (basically samosas filled with cheese). He strongly recommends it for any veggie.The quantity was generous. Didn't really have any space left in my stomach and so couldn't try the desserts. But hey ... that gives me a reason to go again. :)P.S: They don't take bookings as far as i know",

The chair I sat on was wicker and a bit tattered though - not good with my designer tights. The starter and wine was bought quickly and the wine was nice. However we chatted....and chatted...and had a glass of wine....and nibbled on the olives and bread....and had another glass of wine.....until everyone around us had ordered and been served their mains whilst we had not been given ours, We realised that we had drunk the whole bottle of wine and our starter bread basket and olives hadn't been taken away. I asked once where our mains were and didn't get much of a response. Service was gracious when it was finally brought out but they weren't that bothered by our annoyance and its the common conundrum of causing a scene and ruining the evening or getting on with it and making the best. We did the latter. The food was good but very buttery, and they had homemade chilli sauce which was great. It wasn't cheap, but neither was it extortionate. Although busy, the crowd wasn't trendy and were dressed like it was mid-week. Dissapointing, and in my own area of Dalston, there are far far better turkish restaurants.",

The place is invariably busy and the lack of space inside due to all the tables crammed in is, in my opinion, it's only weakness. This is more than made up for by the excellent service, wonderful decor consisting of myriad colourful lamps and theatre posters, and delicious food. I recommend the feta cheese parcels and the marinated lamb, also don't forget to sample their home made chilli sauce! A great place for a modestly priced pre theatre meal if you are heading to the Almeida just round the corner, or to Sadlers Wells, about ten minutes walk away.",

    "text": "When I walked up to this restaurant I wasn't sure I was going to like it - Mem & Laz? That sounds a bit chavvy. But I was very wrong. When you get closer, you can just about see inside - it's very lowly lit creating a snug and cosy environment. The restaurant itself is really small so it's also really intimate - a great place to take the girlfriend / boyfriend for a romantic candlelit dinner without all the ponse wine waiters and neck ache from sitting up-right all evening. However, do try and book and if you are planning a quiet (ish) meal for two, book downstairs, as upstairs is where they seem to pile up the parties/big table bookings.Oh yes - do book as it's always full. Otherwise choose an odd time or go in a two to avoid disappointment.As for the food - it is a bit hit and miss, but generally it's fairly cheap and you get a lot for your money. I had stuffed aubergines on my first visit to this restaurant, whilst my boyfriend had sardines which he adored. On my second visit, however, I was disappointed with my salad and my mother had a hell of a lot of cheese on her plate (we're both vegetarians - what do you give a vegetarian? Ummm - oh, yeh, loads of cheese). My dad had a steak and was impressed but not enough to balance out the negativity brought on by the screaming party behind us.I do love this place because it's just so atmospheric, but don't go here expecting a gourmet meal. Then if you go, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and if you do go as a couple you'll have a lovely evening out and if you book a party you'll have a great evening out.",

My friend wanted to take me to Mem & Laz, one of her favorite spots for a delicious lunch.You can choose between 2 courses (appetizer and main) for 7.95 or 3 courses (add dessert) for 9.95 GBP. The portions were all huge and the amazing food made this one of the best lunch deals I've encountered in a long time.I chose the Warm Goat Cheese with hazelnut crust, roasted red onions and mixed leaves salad to start and my friend picked the Garlic Stuffed Mushroom filled with mozzarella cheese. The goat cheese had the perfect soft texture that was contrasted by the crisp mixed greens. We were basically full after those enormous appetizers. For my main dish I chose the Char-grilled Marinated Lamb with oregano, served with rice and salad. The lamb was really tender and tasted amazing. I was blown away that this kind of quality food was served during a lunch special.My friend picked the Spinach Wraps - spinach & cheddar cheese wrapped in pancakes with fresh tomato sauce & topped with melted mozzarella. Her plate smelled heavenly and she didn't leave a crumb on her plate.Mem & Laz serves an amazing mint tea (with fresh mint muddled in your tea glass) and offers brown sugar cubes to go with it. Now this is a place that I will really miss - it is worth another trip to London!",

I hear you ask...Well, over the past two years Mem and Laz has grown and taken in the restaurants either side. In the process creating a huge interlinked back, with mezzanine, basement banqueting suite, and i assume a giant kitchen somewhere serving Italian, Indian and Turkish foods. So for example you could walk into mem and laz go around the back and pop up in la vita bella. Its really quite incredible in that respect.Anyway, I was there on a Sunday and fancied a roast lamb meal. Now, in my time in England I have embraced the search for a good roast (I have largely come to the conclusion that the best is made at home) but sadly what they gave me was the worst roast i have ever had! Honestly! Its swiped two stars off my review because i am genuinely offended at the disrespect they have shown to the great English tradition.I ordered roast lamb. What i got was a doner kebab soaked in gravy. one brocolli floret and three circles of carrot and five green beans, oh and one yorkshire pudding. Last but not least- It didn't have any god damn roast potatoes!!! I felt like crying and writing a letter to the Queen in complaint, someone needs their citizenship revoked (forget treason and burning flags, this is far worse!). I was so depressed on my way home.Anyway, sort it out lads, please !!!",

Arriving 1:30 on a Sunday, there were the usual two or three course lunch options, four different Sunday roasts, the brunch menu, and daily specials.I got a two-course lunch of moussaka and stuffed peppers. The moussaka wasn't impressive--a slice each of courgette and aubergine under a very thick \u00a0layer of a bechamel inspired substance. The peppers were delicious though--soft and stuffed with a sticky mix of rice, currants, and pine nuts with a side of sour cream. The mixed greens that came with each dish were fresh and topped with a sweet balsamic dressing and both of my courses were topped with a mild tomato based sauce.The boyfriend had the lamb sunday roast with all the sides that a traditional roast ought to have and three big scoops of sage stuffing. It was enough food that he had to take some home, and for under 7 pounds!Overall, the hit and miss quality is more than made up for by the ambience (gorgeous multicoloured glass lamps and busy walls--so much to look at), the selection, and the price.",

    "text": "I was quite impressed by Mem & Laz. If you offer me a 3 course lunch for \u00a38.95 with a a varied and relatively extensive menu to choose from, you are going to get a happy camper. If you choose to go al a carte, there is a wealth of Mediterranean dishes on the menu, both singular and sharers. You will need a fair amount of time to choose what you want because it all sounds so good.Sitting outside on a warm spring day sipping my pomegranate juice, I can say with conviction that while non of my three dishes deserves an award, they were still above average and superb value for money. As Erin said, Islington has too many eateries for Mem & Laz to attract my attention on a regular basis, yet if you are looking for a quick and affordable lunch or dinner in pleasant surroundings, you will be onto a winner eating here.If you are stuck on what dessert to have, the Hanky Panky Chocolate Cake is devine, without being sickly and the apricot crumble has that great combination of crunch and soft fruitiness.",

Went there on a Tuesday night and it was jam packed. Try their amazing chicken wings with their home-made chillie sauce...spicy but oh so good! Servings are enormous and packed with lots of flavour. Service is wonderfully welcoming & efficient. Will be back if I'm in the area and would love to try their breakfast.",

The second time I went to eat in there I didn't even get to sit down before I was insulted by a member of staff. When being shown upstairs to a table by a waiter this guy turned round to my male friend and remarked on four girls sat at a table: \"Aren't they all gorgeous girls? Wouldn't you like to take one out?\" My friend responded: \"I already have a gorgeous girl thank you.\" Referring to me. At this point the waiter looked at me and said: \"Not so much.\" Regardless of how I look, or how much hospitality experience I have, I don't think that's how you're meant to treat paying customers. Needless to say we didn't eat there and I will never be setting foot in the door again.",

Portions were huge too which always makes me a happy diner. I really couldn't fault it. There's a number of other restaurants nearby which are empty...and yet this place on a Monday night is heaving. They've obviously got it right and have even bought the restaurant next door so they could expand. (My fellow diner was an avid fan and told me their entire history over the last 4 years). They also do this really good lunch menu with two course for under a tenner. It reminds me of Bistro 1 in Soho, but with a bit more character and a much wider menu. Yum.",

Yum! My main of roasted lamb and creamy mash was to die for, falling off the bone and served with richly flavoured gravy.Top off the night with a Turkish round of happy birthday and cake? Winning!",

The place is tiny, even though there's an upstairs, and when we first arrived, we were at a two-top surrounded by loud, annoying drunk people on both sides. One of the waiters moved us away to a larger table because we didn't have enough table space, but probably also because he could tell we were annoyed. Anyway, the mixed mezze had a ton of great food. We just ordered the starter version (with 7 kinds of mezze) and I can't imagine how much more food the entree version would be (with 13 types). My favorite things were the grilled halloumi, stuffed pepper, and the diced aubergine. Oh, and if they ask you if you want bread for the table, the answer's always yes. It was so delicious and baked fresh. Ended the meal with a baklava (topped with ice cream) and a snifter of brandy.",

Mem and Laz has two restaurants right next door to each other so I popped into the one on the right. They only had one table left near the door so they kindly suggested we try next door. Next door was as brightly decorated as the first and was fabulously decorated with colourful lamps and posters. The place was packed so the wait to order food was a bit longer than expected. We ordered the mixed mezze consisting of houmous, pita, halloumi and a wide range of 'unknown' ingredients - it was lovely. I moved on to King prawns and baby prawns in a cheesy mix with rice. It was a strange mix but it worked so well! My partner had the mixed grill which looked and tasted great too.The bill came to \u00a343 for two cokes, a sharing starter, prawns main and the \u00a0 mixed grill main - which I thought was entirely reasonably priced! I would definitely recommend this place for the friendly staff and tasty food and I will be sure to visit again in the very near future!!",

The starters are all so good - mushrooms especially. And for main dinner the moussaka; both meat and veg, are incredible! Big portions all served really quickly. There are a lot of staff - all are great and up for helping you decide what to choose. At the end of the dinner once we'd paid they bill they offered us a shot of baileys or amaretto which they haven't done when we've been before but they seemed to all be in an especially good mood this time!",

To be expected from that much cheese, I guess! Great flavor.For mains, we got the chicken skewers, which were good, but straightforward -- no surprises. And the burger, which was a bit overdone for medium rare, served on a buttered and toasted ciabatta with cheese, but nothing else. All condiments were on the side, but because the bread was attached to the cheese like glue, I couldn't get it open to add lettuce/tomato/mayo/whatever. I added it to the bottom but overall, it was a bit dry and lacked flavor. The fries were good, though.The price was good, the location is good and the atmosphere is jovial and friendly. I've heard the pizzas are great and for the price, I'd go for lunch again if someone wanted to.",

    "text": "Mem & Laz has been a long standing resident of Islington. It's continued success even secured it an expansion into the building next door. Now there is more space to enjoy this excellent food fest without the hustle and bustle of Upper Streets main road.Situated next to Sacre Coeur, reviewed by the lovely Valentina last year, this brasserie gives you a second reason to visit the quiet side Theberton Street, off Upper Street. We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of what seemed like Summer with blue skies, dizzying temperatures heights of......14 degrees :/ and not a hint of rain on the horizon. We sat outside and it felt like we were in some hot southern European city. The menu is big. The scrunched up small writing allows for over 60 dishes I'm sure. That said, this did not impact the speed of service or standard of food. I can be a little bit stuck in my ways when it comes to med led menus - you will find me order stuffed mushrooms or garlic prawns - just look at past reviews. Guess what I did, I'm sorry. But my dining companion shook things up a bit with mussels and chicken breast with an interesting sauce. Just to re-cap, I had king prawns sauteed in tomato, garlic and chilli served with rice to start. He had mussels in cream, garlic, shallots and white wine sauce. He is a chef, so expect critical eyes when it comes to good - but he proudly said that every mussel was open, the sauce was light and tasty and definitely a yes from him. The started came with fries, which put the fear of god in us, as we wanted to make sure there as space for main. This gave us the perfect excuse to take our time dining and take in the sunshine.For main course, I had grilled calamari with rocket. Whilst the calamari was a little bit to tough for my taste, I still enjoyed it. He had grilled chicken breast with honey and mustard dressing, with a side order of Turkish spicy sauce. The chicken was tender, the sauce was interesting (I have normally make it with pork chops), and the spicy sauce, well, make sure you have a glass of water nearby as its not for the faint-hearted. All in all, Mem & Laz continues to keep the locals and visitors happy. It is one for all seasons, with the intimate seating inside for the winter and the terrace seating outside for the Summer. And at \u00a348.02 for two courses, beer and two glasses of wine (inc service), you cannot go wrong.The problem I have now is which do I choose when I come to Theberton Street in the future, Sacre Coeur or Mel & Lax. Decisions, decisions.",

But I was surprised!Bread with olives is really tasty and the texture of the bread was perfect.I ordered the mixed seafood rice plate and it was super yummy. It was huge, and I was full after half, but I kept eating b/c it was so good. Couldn't finish it, though! I'm full just thinking about it.Atmosphere is lively and waitstaff was pretty friendly. Can't complain. I'd go back for a casual evening out.",

    "text": "A wonderful evening. The restaurant is beautifully designed and a lot larger than you'd expect from the outside; crossed over two floors and sporting a balcony dining feel. An incredible selection of food and what we ordered was delicious. Fantastic service from our waiter and although we did dine quite late (10pm) we were never rushed even though we were still finishing drinks past midnight. A delightful find and will definitely be going again. Although I went with a girlfriend, it would be an ideal place for a date; impressive and very reasonably priced.",

I ordered the moussaka (veg) and fish cakes, which were part of a 2-part lunch deal that I thought was very reasonable. All the food was great, and the place is so cutely decorated! I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I was in the Islington area and looking for lunch I'd recommend stopping by.",

The food is delicious, service fast and friendly!I would always recommend reserving a table to avid disappointment, especially when going out with a group! It\u00b4s a cozy place, but seats are limited.I will defnitely be back!",
