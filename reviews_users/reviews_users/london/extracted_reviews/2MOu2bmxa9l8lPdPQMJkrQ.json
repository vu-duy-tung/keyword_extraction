Highlights - terrace with heat lamps, restaurant is attached to nice pub with good booths and friendly barmen, very friendly waiters, glass roof that lets in lots of light, consistently good staples (steak, fish and chips) and new items added to the menu every few months.Hard to explain, but I just feel welcome when I walk in, which doesn't always happen in Chelsea. . .There is also a room upstairs that can be rented for private parties.

Nice outside area, but the day I was here was so unbearably hot that a paleface like myself couldn't take advantage of it. Many people were and the pimms was flowing liberally.

On a rainy Sunday afternoon, I looked up the address and went down to South Kensington tube station, from there it's just a few minutes walk. The Admiral Codrington is a nice, light, and really comfortable place to spend some time. I had a great wine, and also didn't need to wait long for the highly appreciated burger. I fully support Daniel Young's judgment to put it at least on #3 in London's burger top ten. The meat was deliciously prepared, and the bun fitted the patty perfectly. It was big enough, but not too big, and it didn't dissolve somewhere on the way. If you like burgers, you shouldn't miss this one! I also genuinely liked the furniture and interior, it's really a very nice place to eat a brilliant burger and read an articulate article while enjoying a wonderful wine.",

Furthermore, the food was incredible, and was not too expensive. I had the prawns, which were huge, savory, and delicious.

What a disappointment. My friend booked the four of us a table for 6:30pm - we arrived a bit early and had some drinks at the bar. The wine/drinks menu is quite extensive but we came to find that a bunch of it was unavailable.Following we shared a few starters for dinner and had a bottle of wine before getting our main courses : admiral burger, fish and chips, and bream. I settled on the bream - it was a decent choice but nothing special - the appetizers as well : squid, an egg dish and a chicken salad dish were also just okay - the calamari being my third night of squid starters (and nothing on Buthsaba ethai and dishoom). \u00a0The burgers, I was told weren't bad, but given the rest of the nights experience and all the great burger joints popping up in central, not a reason enough to come here.The low of the dinner was having our server come over at 7:30 and ask us to move to a different table in the mostly empty restaurant because of a reservation that was coming in. This was only an hour into our booked ahead dinner, we weren't given any forewarning at the start, and every table is generally the same size so the switch didn't appear to be necessary. We had been deciding on a dessert at this point but decided not to continue on and walked to the Goat instead for after dinner drinks. I've been in London long enough now to not expect a crazy level of service but of all restaurants I've been to this was the oddest and least apologetic Ive encountered. So in short, step it up Admiral- what a disappointing westward venture. From,A less-than-impressed east Londoner",

My first thought was, 'Is my last minute reservation really going to be okay?' Then I noticed the almost empty back dining area. Whew!The front area looks like your typical British pub. Wooden bar, dark and an outside drinking area. They also have a bar menu in the bar area where they serve their delicious triple cooked chips (plus a few other things which looked amazing as well).Then the restaurant. It's a completely different atmosphere. A gorgeous sky light above a very posh looking dining area. Not at all like the pub inside. I had the burger. The burger at Admiral Codrington has been blogged about and reviewed many times online. (Google for it!) There's a mix of meats done in the Heston Blumenthal method. They do something interesting with the cheese. It's on a brioche bun. It's a pretty damn good burger. Definitely worth stopping in for if you're in the area. Plus the chips are fantastic. Some of the best chips in London. I asked for the Bloody Mary ketchup to go with it. (I saw it on the bar menu.) Get it. It's quite similar to the American style cocktail sauce you would get on a shrimp cocktail. (Not Mary Rose sauce that you would get in the UK.) It's tangy and delicious.I ended up ordering the sticky toffee for dessert. Very well done. Not the best I've had, but tasty.Good job Admiral, I can see why you're no longer a Captain!",

    "text": "I've got a fever...and the only prescription is MORE COWBELL! Or rather, more cow. Preferably in burger form. Hot Dinners recently reviewed the Admiral Codrington with a focus on their burger offering. Based on this, and my quest for the best burger in London, I headed there with Tracy L for a lunch time feast. \u00a0Note: \u00a0\u00a315 for a cheeseburger seems pretty high (and makes the \u00a320 burger for B&L not too outrageous) so for that price you expect excellence without peer. And you get it, mostly. As described by HD, the meat is personally selected by the Chef and then aged in house (I imagine in the cold cellar that seems to run the entire length of the restaurant and is accessed through door in the floor next to the bar). It is then coarsely ground and formed into 8oz patties with light seasoning in an effort to let the meat speak for itself.The cheese alone requires a story. Legend has it that the chef infuses cream with bacon and parmesan rind. Mature cheddar, parmesan, and American cheese are then melted into the cream. The resulting cheesy mixture is chilled and sliced before being used to top the burger. So the question has to be, is it worth it? I want to say yes, I really do. Flavourwise, the cheese has a soft smooth consistency that melts in your mouth and its heaven on a patty. It's lost that over processed aftertaste inherent in American cheese slices, gained a silkiness rather than the slightly chunky way that cheddar insists on, and mellowed the parmesan into a deep flavour that warms and comforts without slapping you in the face. But I wonder just how much time and effort had to go in to this in order to achieve the cheese. In addition, it's a cheese that really only suits burgers and I have a hard time imagining it on anything else (although maybe if they added a steak sandwich to the menu that could work). Finally, the bacon and parmesan infusion into the cream seems redundant as you are already adding parmesan to the cheese later and the burger comes with two (albeit very small) strips of bacon.The burgers is simply served on a brioche bun which does the job of soaking up juices admirably and managed to almost hold together until the end. Make no mistake, this is a messy burger which will require you to grab it with both hands and tear in. The brioche is soft and fluffy and seems to melt away.And there, folks, lies the problem. Everything was too smooth, too easily melt in your mouth, to provide any texture. The incredible quality of the meat made it like butter on warm day, the soft brioche soaked with juices dissolved faster than cotton candy, the cheese just swirled around and was gone leaving just a memory. I have teeth for a reason and they were begging for something to bite on, some sort of texture that gave substance to these great flavours my tongue swore were there. Perhaps if we had order the burgers medium instead of medium rare (they came out looking more rare than medium) there would have been a better balance or if there was more delicious crunchy bacon, but as it stood I felt a bit let down by what had all the hallmarks of a great meal.On other bits, the chips were fluffy inside and crunchy outside but had an odd taste as if the oil had been used for frying fish or was just a tad too stale. The salmon ceviche was truly tasteless with the overdose of lime pickling out all flavour of the fish and the jalapenos failing to make a notable appearance. The garlic mash was similarly smooth and decent although I was left with the feeling I could have made a better one at home. Great ambience with very pretty blonde wait staff.The sticky toffee pudding was fantastic though and I would highly recommend it. Soft and moist cake with rich date sauce and a tiny pitcher of cream to mellow out the sweetness. Incredible!Overall, it's a tad on the expensive side but a pretty decent meal. Is it the best burger in London? Tastewise it was right up there but overall it's above average but by no means deserving of the top spot.",

The pub also sports its own humidor making it the perfect place to go, have a pint and cigar.The attached restaurant serves very good gastropub food, but personally to stick with a portion of chips with my Guinness \u00a0The only downside is that it is a little expensive.So if your in the neighbourhood and want somewhere for a quiet drink, come here",

A nice if a not a bit small area outside for summer drinking and a fairly large pub with sofa's etc to chat and enjoy some time out. They have a good reputation for food and have been mentioned in the Michelin guide so they must be doing good things in order to get a mention. A loyal fan base for this one predominately the Chelsea Polo shirt brigade but it has a nice atmosphere and a good place to spend the evening. \u00a0My advice would be to give it a go and if for any reason it isn't for you there are numerous pubs and bars on Walton St which is just a 3 minute amble. Good pub, good food and a good place to go on a Friday night for a few beers in a friendly atmosphere.",

    "text": "One thing I hate about Yelp, you just can't give 20 stars to a restaurant.Hi, I am a 10-year-old boy visiting London during school break and I can assure you that Admiral Codrington is SOOOO AWESOME! It's in the perfect location - a 10 minute walk from Old Brompton Rd, which is literally close to everything interesting in London. It's not so noisy, but lots of people out front; No honking cars interrupting your conversation, and a quiet and AWESOME part of the city. And our waiter was amazing! His name was Michele and he totally deserves to be in this review. Now, about the food:First, I just want to mention that there was a kids menu that had food that I really liked, so this restaurant is kid-friendly unlike most London restaurants.Second, the Linguini was TRULY AMAZING. It's like somebody sprinkled fairy dust over it to make it tasty. I like the salt balance in the pasta sauce that they had.Third, the fish tasted like heaven. Or maybe a million times better. But whatever. It's really good and exposes the taste throughout the mouth when normal fish just has a taste for like a second or two. Finally, The chips are amazing, like American \"French Fries\" but bigger and tastes real. It leaves a good aftertaste.To wrap things up, If you don't go here when you visit London, you are missing out on A LOT.",

    "text": "I'll admit that my main reason for coming here (and the target of this review) is for the burger. \u00a0It's been on at least one top 10 burgers in London list and I can see why.A short primer on burgers first. \u00a0At the heart of it is the classic (All-American) burger in which the beef is in the leading role, balanced by a limited cast of supporting elements. \u00a0A variation on that ideal is the grease bomb, which this pub seeks perfection in. \u00a0If you don't like that style (as some reviewers don't) then this isn't the place for you. \u00a0Open to debate is whether one should review a food that one inherently dislikes.Delicious this was, and the bun did soak the grease nicely, with the bacon adding a bit of salt to give it structure. \u00a0The burger had cole slaw on it which seemed to add to the savoriness but I suspect there was some underlying tartness to cut the fat almost imperceptibly. \u00a0The \"chips\" were too thick for my liking, but no major complaints.A pint of Guiness to wash it all down, and I was more than pleased with my visit.",

    "text": "I'm surprised no one else seems to have written about the bloody delicious burgers at this pub. I kept hearing about the legendary double-stack cheeseburger special this week from bloggers so I decided to make a trip and try it myself.The meat is sourced from O'Shea of Knightsbridge - guaranteed quality beef. It might sound a bit strange, but you can actually taste the beef in the patty, whereas mediocre patties lack flavour. The cheese used is in fact a blend of shallots, parmesan, cheddar, bacon fat etc which become \"cheese slices\" once cooled. The melted gooey cheese combined with two beef patties, gherkins, lettuce, and the sauce that reminded me of thousand island dressing made for a brilliant burger combination. Hefty but so satisfying. The chips are very thick, textured and fried just enough.The burger is seriously up there with the \"best burgers in London\". \u00a316 for a burger and chips is steep, but it's worth it. Burger fans, this place is a must-try!",
