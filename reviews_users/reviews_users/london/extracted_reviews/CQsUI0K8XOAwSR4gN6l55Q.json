    "text": "We visited Pizza Union around 23:00 (11pm) on a Tuesday and were extremely pleased with the freshness and quality of the food and the speed with which it was delivered. The thin crust personal (12 inch) pizzas are made right then and there in front of you and there are a variety of toppings you can add to your liking. We ordered a mushroom pizza (4.95) and a pizzeria salad (3.95) and received a buzzer that rings to indicate when the food is ready; ours rang within 10 minutes. The atmosphere was great- the spacious surroundings and indie music complemented the table designs and the overall dim, intimate atmosphere which greatly enhanced our first London fast food dining experience. There are many seating options-barstools near the window, tables in the middle (good for big groups), and booths in the back. There weren't many patrons while we were there but when we passed by the next day we noticed that the place is very popular around lunchtime and dinnertime. I truly hope that this franchise makes its way to the US.TIP: The olive oil has a kick to it- we didn't notice the giant floating red pepper inside the olive oil bottle until after we doused our salad.",

The relaxed atmosphere was obvious as soon as we arrived and the long, beautifully tiled communal tables add to this as well as bringing people together. We sat at a table in front of the huge window, a perfect spot for people watching. I ordered the Stagioni pizza while my friend ordered the Reine, we only had to wait 5 minutes before the gadgets we were given upon ordering buzzed. This system is really simple - but it definitely works! Wine is served in unfussy tumblers and is pretty good value at \u00a311.50 a bottle. Our pizzas were crisp and had loads of toppings, the roman style thin base makes the pizza feel lighter than its Neapolitan cousin, allowing room for a delicious Nutella and mascarpone dulce! I felt like I had been transported to Rome when I was eating at this unfussy, straightforward pizza joint. The pizzas are EXTREMELY good value and I will definitely be going back!",

Reasonably priced (\u00a35-7) and a great selection of toppings that can be customised (Mushrooms & I do not get on, and they always seem to feature on the pizza I want, swapped them for sausage!) The bases are crispy Roman style, so can be a bit blackened around the edges. I left the very edge, and was told by the Sicilian at the table that in Sicily that would mean I didn't like the pizza, which I can assure you was very much not the case. Had the Stagioni and the flavours (along with my added sausage) worked so well. Make sure you save room for pudding, the Classico Dolce is amazing, in my opinion the best of the three (& yes, we tried them all!) If you're looking for fast, tasty pizza, look no further",

There are a few 4 seater tables towards the back of the restaurant. \u00a0 All of the staff I encountered were really nice and friendly. \u00a0 The pizza? Well it's cheap for starters. The most expensive pizza tops out at \u00a36.50 and is loaded with flavoursome toppings. 12\" cooked fresh and with cheap drinks on the side and they're on to a winner. My only criticism is that while the service is extra speedy, which is fantastic, the artichokes on my pizza weren't cooked properly as they really needed to be roasted for longer. Apart from that (first world problems eh?) everything was absolutely delicious. \u00a0 There's not much in the way of sides, just olives, salads and spiced corn but they do have a few desserts which I didn't try on this occasion. \u00a0 Is it the best pizza in the city? I suppose it depends what you like. For me? Certainly not! But for the price and the service this is pretty good!",

We were in and out in a half hour and that included time waiting on line to order. The only thing I didn't like is their no substitution rule, which I didn't see written anywhere. I ordered the tropicali but wanted to swap ham for chicken. Instead I had to order a margherita and add the tropicali ingredients. The pizza's cheap enough that it still cost only \u00a35.95 total, but still. I'm fine with not being allowed to make substitutions as long as it's clear - here, it wasn't. The fiorentina was good, too. The egg was cooked just right and the spinach was fresh and tasty. Definitely one I'll be returning to. Be warned: the line can sometimes look very long, but it will move fairly quickly.",

Pizza Union is MOD's faster, cheaper, cooler cousin. The pizza menu prices range from \u00a32.95 for blanco (garlic bread), \u00a33.95 Margherita, and up to \u00a36.50 for the meat supremo known as the carne. You can also add your own toppings. The reason this reminds me of MOD, despite not having he build your own for one price theme, is the dough is thin and the pizza is ready in ~5 mins or less. This was despite showing up during the lunch rush-- $5 mins later I had a good looking pizza. The same dough was surprisingly soft (I had expected a more toothsome texture given the light char and use of a coal brick oven) but the ingredients were surprisingly hearty for the price and mascarpone and fresh sausage for $5\u00a3? Impressive. The sauce worked. The arugula (rocket to Brits) was fresh but lacked the pepperiness of truly in season arugula. Super hipster, they have baristas. Plan to spend half as much as your pizza on beer or even soda. All in all a nice, quick, little lunch stop with decent to good tasting pizza, helpful and cheerful staff, and super fast light food.",

    "text": "Ahhhh Pizza Union, my one true pizza love! Yesterday I finally visited the Pentonville Road location and yet again Pizza Union triumphs with their cheap but fantastic pizzas. I've made the decision (and it's a big decision), for me Pizza Union is THE BEST pizza in the city. There, I said it!To start we have some olives - I LOVE their olives. Juicy and flavoured beautifully with garlic oil. Not over buttery, just great mixed olives! I opted for the Stagioni (again), I just love it! It's a great mix of so many toppings - ham, pepperoni, olives and mushrooms, all it quarters. It's like 4 pizzas in one! Thin and crispy base, lots of tomato and great toppings! WIN.We also shared the bianca which is their garlic bread and cheese option. It was yummy!And we had the Verdera salad - I must give a shout out the their salads. Fresh and really really tasty! Their pizza salad in particular is awesome! I always get one on the side as I end up putting half of it on the pizza. Can't beat rocket on a pizza. Mmm.In total for 3 pizzas, a salad, olives and drink it was just \u00a322! What more can you want? Sure we over ordered and had to leave some but who cares for that price! If you haven't been, GO! If you have been, go again and again and again!",

    "text": "I can't fault this at all.When awarding stars I think I have this, erm...\"gut feel\"...there's an algorithm that gets processed, even if I'm not entirely able to articulate it. It's something about value for deliciousness, GBP per wow-bite. And here, where the pizzas are affordable and quick and delicious...well, Pizza Union you got yourself 5 stars with that formula!I saw this concept back in the US last time I was visiting; essentially they are very quickly fired pizzas, in and out of the oven in 180 seconds. Fast turnaround, quick pizzas. What's not to love (TRICK QUESTION: NOTHING).The basic white garlic 'bread' pizza starts at 2.50 or so. I enjoyed the fiorentina today, topped with fresh spinach leaves and a whole egg. I added some chicken for 1GBP, which was not these artificial blocks of protein but looked like pulled chicken breast (great). The pizza came quickly, and I added on a 0.50 mini tub of creamy dip. Walk your pizza over to a table (there are high-tops and tables) and you can personalize further with hot chili flakes, oregano, chili oil, salt and pepper. The chili oil was totally unnecessary, but never one to shy away from gilding the lily: I went for it. It was nicely spicy. There are sweet doughs and gelato as dessert options, but I have yet to try 'em. Beer and various soft drinks as hydration options.Yelp note: no delivery (yet), but takeaway options available. Note that M-F, 12 - 2pm, the limit is 4pizzas/pp.",

It will be communal and you will need to throw some elbows.This trendy yet casual place gets BUSY so the rationale behind the no bookings policy is beyond me. The only reason this spot gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the Shake Shack style logistics of the queue, order and find your own seating model doesn't always come together well. Do yourself a favor and don't come here with a large group during peak times. You could be left holding a pizza with nowhere to sit. They do offer takeaway though if it comes down to it. This place is about cheap, customizable, made-to-order personal sized pizzas. And lest you get bored of the inventive combinations on the menu, you always have the freedom to make your own or add extra toppings. True to its name, the pizza comes out super fast after you order it. I had the Calabria - tomato sauce, mozzarella, mascarpone, n'duja spicy sausage, rocket all on top of a nice thin crust. The flavors came together really well - one delicious pizza! It's a sizable pie (12 inch) and filling despite the thin crust. Come hungry. Note to management: jugs of tap water at the counter would eliminate the need for customers to interrupt the awesome and very friendly guy turning pizzas in the oven to request a refill of tap water in your tiny cups.",

Finally, I have found my spot for pizza!!This place is incredible, pizzas are a great size, super thin crust, which I love, and at around the \u00a35/6 mark which is a steal!! The whole concept of the place is you go in, queue, which is roughly 15 minutes on a busy night, and then after the queue you are given a buzzer which buzzes when your pizza is ready! Genius! Even better part is the wait is literally non-existent like 10 minutes max and you are resented with your own bit of yummy heaven!!I got the peppers one.. verduro I think it's called and modified it to add chicken! Wowwww crispy and cooked to perfection! Piping and no chance I would be sharing this!! Literally the best pizza I eaten in a very, very long time!!!Can't wait to go back and try out some of the other beauties on the menu and the best thing is - if you want to add extra ingredients you totally can!",

Around \u00a35 and \u00a36 respectively! Got to say the latter with its mascarpone & n'duja sausage is awesome. Get in ma belly!But honestly the prices are similar to the famous Icco on Goodge St. The cheapest coming in at \u00a33.95 for a simple margherita too. I must say that the crust must be the thinnest I've ever had anywhere. I'm not sure if I like it quite that thin, so prefer the Icco larger base. But they do out a generous amount of toppings here which is great. All pizza places are effectively fast food and the space inside was large and open. Can imagine it being buzzing at night (I went for lunch).I will definitely come back as I heard they will allow you to mix and match the pizza toppings on one pizza (non peak times) if you are lucky. It gets a 3 to 4 star based on mainly that it is a cheap option to a bustling pizza scene. Nice addition though, with a somewhat different type of pizza.",

Approx \u00a34 for a 12\" margherita is a great deal. You go to the desk to put your order in and then get one of those things that vibrate when your order's ready. All very efficient. The pizza took ten minutes before it was in front of me.Pizza itself - lots of tomato sauce, thin and crispy, slightly weird chemical taste that I find is often the case with wood-fired pizza ovens. I liked the dip options at the counter for mopping up the crusts. Overall, can't complain for the price and I like the decor and quick service.",

    "text": "The first thing I said when I sat down to try Pizza Union's pizza was \"I'll have you all know, I am a pizza snob\" - meaning I'm very fussy when it comes to pizza and I've had so many bad experiences with pizza in London that at some point I kinda gave up. Two bites later I was blabbering something like OH GOFD THIF IF FO DELICIOUF CAN I HAF MORE PLEAFE?Deep pan pizza is something that should not even exist in my book, that's why when I saw how thin the base/crust of Pizza Union's pizza was I was very very happy. They make pizza like we do at home back in Sicily: thin, crispy on the edges, slightly over-cooked to make sure there is crunchiness and the middle isn't soggy and tearing (like it would be in a Neapolitan pizza made by...someone who doesn't know how to make Neapolitan pizza). It was a feast for my palate. I picked the Calabria pizza because 'nduja sausage & mascarpone is the best combo since the invention of bread & nutella, I didn't devour it as quickly as I had hoped (it is deceivingly filling) but it was gone pretty quickly nonetheless. Now, dessert isn't something I would usually order when I go for pizza (I mean...what could they possibly offer that isn't frozen?), but at Pizza Union you can pick between 3 pizza-dough doughnuts with different fillings. We tried all 3: coconut, classic and something with peanuts if I'm not mistaken. When you read through the menu and you see the fillings listed for each of the doughnuts, you'll be tempted to try the one that sounds the fancier (the nuts one) but I promise, I PROMISE the classic rules them all. It's filled with Nutella so what else would you want?The restaurant itself is quite big, you might have to swing your butt back and forth a few times to get to your table without touching the people sat down at their tables (or their food/belongings) but that's a work-out I'm willing to do if at the end of the triathlon the reward is THAT pizza. Will be coming back",

I have been in the area quite a few times, just by King's Cross station, even just across the street at Big Chill House, but never noticed PIzza Union. Even though it's a no booking place, the vibe is a cool warehouse chic, and on Sunday evening it was not hard to find a free table, and there was no queue to order, either. It didn't take long for the food to be ready, and we received a buzzer upon ordering that went off when the food was ready. All pizzas are under \u00a36.50. We also ordered a few of the salads, though they are particularly rocket heavy and lacking in dressing, so I wouldn't particularly recommend those. The pizzas are thin crust, but substantial enough for one person. I like the simplicity of the operation and the price cannot be beat.",

But seriously, I've had \u20ac4 pizzas before in Italy and it was WAYYYY better than this. Would not recommend this place.

The pizzas were cooked just fine as regards to level of crispness. One of the pizzas were slightly bland and distinctively unseasoned, however the pepperoni pizza with peppers was a little spicy with a rich flavor of cheese as well as other toppings. The pizza was thin, fulfilling and not to much. The food experience here gets a 4 total. Come in, enjoy it yourself.",

The wood-fired pizza is cooked quickly right in front of you and they have beer and wine choices. Everything is served in a fast-casual setting where you order at the counter and go grab your own food when it's ready.

I went for the Calabria, but without rocket, and it was no trouble. I also grabbed a can of Coke and a garlic dip, and the whole shebang was under \u00a38. You're given a buzzer and sent to find a seat, which was easily as it wasn't busy. Most of the seating is on backless stools but they do have some tables. Cutlery and a bottle of olive oi is in big cans on the table, and they also have oregano and chili flake shakers. Napkins were in a tin on a shelf above the bin.The wait wasn't long - 5 minutes, maybe, and my buzzer went. I was pleased it comes cut because I hate eating pizza with a knife and fork. I was on my own and had my Kindle out and never were my hands all greasy or messy, which is good! I really, really liked the n'duja on the pizza - spicy but not overpowering, salty and savoury. A delicious choice, and the mascarpone on the pizza was there to cool off your mouth if you went overboard on a bite. The crust was thin and not hard - but not floppy, either. The ends of the crust were nice and crunch and tasted good in my garlic dip - but I probably wouldn't bother with the dip again. It was quite mayonnaise-like. The crust was a bit bland, and lovers of a sourdough crust might be bothered by this.The pizza was more than I could eat today but probably most people would finish it on their own. I certainly wouldn't share one, unless you also had a salad or were planning on getting that delicious sounding Nutella dough ring...",

I ordered a margherita pizza (\u00a33.95) with N'duja spicy sausage (+\u00a31.00), mixed olives (\u00a31.50), garlic dip (\u00a30.50), and Diet Coke (\u00a31.30). Their pizzas are 12\" and made fresh to order. They gave us buzzers to let us know when our pizzas were ready and the wait was only about ten minutes. The mixed olives were great to munch on while we waited. The pizzas were so good. I love the thin crust and the spiciness of the N'duja sausage. The creamy garlic dip cooled things down before it got to be too much. We also ended up getting gelatos (\u00a32.50) for dessert. The cookies and cream gelato was good, but the salted caramel was much more flavourful and was the favourite between the two.This place serves great food for great prices. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "\" I think I'm in love with London already.\" That's what my mom said after being in London for approximately 2 whole seconds and losing her Pizza Union virginity soon after. I'd be going to Pizza Union 2-4 times a week since I started living just up the road from the Kings Cross location. Thats was a bad idea. So bad. But my mom was right (aren't they always). Pizza Union is the B E S T pizza I had in London during the months I lived there. Pizza Union is awesome because :1. They have fast + consistent service 2. The people are friendly ( the lady at the till didn't judge me for being there just as much as her instead, she remembered my order)3. It is quality + cheap (two things that don't always go hand-in-hand)Pizza Union uses the freshest ingredients. If you order one of their Pizzas with mozzarella on it, it's the gooiest cheese ever. It's almost as if they got it straight from Italy. My Italian friend, Fran, called Pizza Union authentic Italian pizza after tasting their MARGHERITA. My absolute favorite Pizza Union Pie of all time is: THE CARNE. My goodness, it's probably the most fatty, but its already too late to think about that. It has fresh chicken, succulent beef AND pepperoni on it. With a tomato and mozzarella base and topped with onions and rosemary. You cannot go wrong. I always throw some oregano and olive oil on top as well. Ahhh man, to say the least, I miss Pizza Union everyday that I am away and hope to return soon. TIP: Pizza Union is the cheapest, yet quality pizza that you're going to find in LDN. Hands down. The Carne is one of their most \"expensive\" pizzas and its only \u00a36.50. Craziness, I know!How could I forget to mention the sauces. Oh my, I slept on them for the longest time, but when I finally tried one, there was no way I was leaving without getting one. The 'garlic herb' sauce is my favorite. It's only 50 pence more and totally worth all of its garlicky glory. I simply fold my slice like a taco and dip. Repeat. Burp. Repeat.",
