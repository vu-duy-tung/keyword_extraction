I've been a fan of the Hammersmith location for years. \u00a0This location has nice high ceilings and still manages to be cozy, and in general is a more attractive venue than Hammersmith (at least, last time I was there, a few years ago).Food was quite excellent (once you get past the hard-to-read font on the menu -- their \"G\" icon, for \"gluten-free,\" looks like an O, confusing more than just me). \u00a0I started with a small \"woodland\" salad with spinach, mushrooms, hazelnuts, and truffle oil dressing. \u00a0I know I'm supposed to feel about truffle oil like one is supposed to feel about Carmina Burana -- discriminating distaste -- but they both strike just the right note, for me. \u00a0A small was actually small.Next, I had the Wild Mushroom & Celeriac Rosti, most of the words of which I didn't know (rosti? girolles? paris brown? cep?), but it was a great random choice: savory and perfect for a freezing night.I'm totally coming back.",

Not so many non-Asian food can be served in this sophisticated manner.I wanted to give four stars but I had a huge headache and couldn't enjoy this cozy place. I know that they managed to present vegetarian food in this sophisticated manner but, somehow what I had wasn't looking so attractive. I'm sure the present can be improved make it look more seductive? I enjoyed the presentation but I couldn't remember the experience. Normally I will remember what was the feel when I've bitten, swallow eg flavor, crunchiness and smoothness. I generally do appreciate tasting food and it's like a travel of tastes while I'm chewing. I didn't get any remarkable sensation. The okra was used which has a peculiar texture. It's a good start to use and combine with something crunchy so that you could achieve balanced chewing feel. There's a space to develop. Good opportunity.If I wasn't well, I may decide not go back, but health matters for tasting. My tongue and nose need to be calibrated.I'm going to Hammersmith one with another vegetarian friend. Watch the space.",

To start, the front host was exceptionally accommodating: we had no reservation, walked in off the street, had a toddler and a pram... he didn't bat an eye, and went out of his way to make us comfortable. We were both surprised by how large the interior is, and also how upscale it felt. Veg restaurants often have that weird grimy hippie vibe, even when they serve better quality food. This felt like any other nice restaurant in the neighborhood. \u00a0Food was excellent. We had the leek and cheese tart (amazing), the halloumi (my husband's favorite) and the feta and cpus cous fritters (also good). For dinner we split the eggplant (which was a little bland) and the mushroom rotolo - which was absolutely divine. We plan to return during our stay here!",

Spices and weird ingredients can be a nightmare for her (and for me). I tried this place because I supposed that a vegetarian place could be the answer for a person like her, and I was right! The food was gorgeous, tasty, and very well presented. I got the potato roll filled with wild mushrooms with a creamy and delicate mushrooms sauce and some steamed string beans. My mom got the salad with artichoke hearts, dried tomatoes, hazelnuts and string beans and after a week, she still speaks of this salad (thank you! thank you! thank you!) My mother in law got the Tali, the plate with chapati, Dal, fried okra and mango salad, (this one was \u00a0good too). We didn't take any desserts, we were already happily, full.

The main menu was not in service, instead a Brunch list was offered, so I can only comment on the dishes therein.Warm, friendly welcome, and as we arrived at 12:30 on a wet day it did not fill up till we had been seated a while. Staff remained attentive and really helpful throughout.Chose from the wine list, which is limited and not expensive. Wines were only OK, in the sense that they were not faulty but rather dull and not very interesting. The Saumur Blanc was not as good as the Verdicchio. They need a star or two to offer.Bread and brilliant olive oil (charged for) gave us a good nibble whilst we waited for fellow diners and food after ordering.Food uniformly attractively presented, very fresh, and every dish very good indeed. I thought the starters a little generous, but then it was brunch. The mains were beautifully presented (2 variety) Tortillas for myself and Root Vegetable Rotolo for my chums. We had the Dessert Mezze as we were rather full and it worked excellently, giving everyone a proper taste of each possible dessert for the next visit. Nicely our waiter asked us what we thought of the dessert offerings and understood out suggestions about one and we felt that the feedback would be taken on board \u00a0not a criticism by the way..Worth seeking out, especially if you have vegetarian leaning!

The staff were lovely though, and the drinks were great",

    "text": "I am so conflicted in giving The Gate three stars versus five. It's such a huge discrepancy, but I think it needs to be done. I have been to this place almost 5 times, and have had great experiences and mixed experiences.First, the good. I love that this place just elevates the goodness of vegetarian food instead of making faux meat dishes. I have been to those places, and it is almost always a disaster. The seasonal menu keeps things exciting and yet the core menu usually remains the same. The rotolo in any of it's veggie incarnations is delightful. The aubergine schnitzel is another amazing entree to go for, the saffron cream sauce complements it perfectly. The dessert mezze is an absolute MUST HAVE! Order it a few minutes before you are done your main meal, and wait for this masterpiece to arrive.Now on to the bad. I was contemplating whether to do this or not, but I think it is warranted. 3 out of the 5 times I have been, there was absolutely atrocious service. My guests and I were ignored for almost 45 minutes before our appetizers even arrived, and were left without our main courses for an equally long time. The staff did not seem to care, and all we got was \"yes, it will be out soon\". Furthermore, there are quite a few dishes on the menu that are just off the mark. There was an okra dish that was just okay, and any main salad I have gotten has been quite bland and uninspired. \u00a0At the end of the day, I would probably still go to The Gate. The frequency with which I go though is questionable.",

I loved the description of the food and everything sounded so yummy. In order to sample more stuff, instead of getting two mains, we decided to get 5 small dishes. We had the Thai salad, Arancini, beet root ravioli, courgette flower \u00a0and halloumi kibi. The Arancini and courgette were quite good, but heavy. The Thai salad was flavorless and I had to add a lot of salt to make it less blend. halloumi kibi was so disappointing that it reminded me of the food from our canteen. I so wanted this place to be good, but I was so disappointed with the food.",

I've been to Mildred's before and enjoyed that too, but the presentation and care taken to prepare the food here was a step above, although this was also reflected in the price. We started with the mezze - a selection if small portions of the other starters, which was excellent. For mains, my aubergine schnitzel was good, and my partner's polenta salad was also very tasty. The wine was of good quality, if a little pricey (we had the Riesling) and it's great to see that they stock local beers from Five Points and Redchurch. Service was friendly too. We had a great time and I didn't miss the meat at all.",

It was the soup starter that first seriously impressed though. We both went for a butternut squash, coconut milk and chilli soup and it was one of the loveliest soups I've ever had. Just about perfect!For the main course I went for probably their best known dish (and the one that caught my eye when first perusing their menu) the aubergine schnitzel. I enjoy a proper schnitzel and I liked the non meat take on it. Very nice. When I go back next time it'll be hard to decide what to try as I'd eat just about anything on the menu!To drink they have some excellently selected beers from local breweries, Five Points and London Fields...but I have a big issue with the price of six pounds. This is a very nice meal, the kind I wouldn't have every week, and I expect to pay a bit more for the food. But I've never paid anything like that for a beer and felt a little bit fleeced on that count.",

We got 3 courses that all sounded interesting and promised a lot of flavour.Well, what we got was a LOT of flavours. Too many flavours. It started to taste like they just crammed a bundle of randomly chosen flavours and tried to make them taste nice in one dish. To me, this does not really 'show off' the wonderful flavours different vegetables can have when cooked right and paired with the right ingredients. To be fair to them, the individual items were cooked well, but the dishes were very disappointing considering the hype.It seems like they have the technique, but they just don't have the ideas quite right or thought out well. Maybe that's just what they want to be or they need more time to mature. I'm not sure. I will keep an eye on the menu, but I'm not rushing back to this place on a special occasion.",

Not a great start.Our mains arrived - very quickly.We ordered the Aubergine Schnitzel, which was somehow both overly greasy and bland at the same time.

I won't lie, I decided to come here for lunch with friends only because I looked at their desert menu and saw vegan eaton mess on it. Eaton-fucking-mess! That too vegan. I would've eaten through a bucket of raw kale to get to the eaton mess. But thankfully it did not come to that.For starters we had the miso-glazed aubergine, some herby polenta fries, and the bread basket. The aubergine was heavenly. Perfectly sweet and savory. I wish all aubergines were made like this. Or for that matter, all veggies. The polentat fries, predictably, were fantastice. I mean what's not to like. So, as would've been expected, I ended up ordering more of those. For the mains, we had the rotola, the laksa, and the artichoke carciofini. Everything was good, albeit a little one-dimensional. Except the laksa, which was the star of the show. Nicely seasoned with a bit of a punch and a big helping of veggies.And now, the moment, you've all been waiting for, how was the eaton mess? You know how you sometimes build up something in your head and it then never lives up to its expectations? This was NOT one of those times. The meringue was still crunchy and not too sweet. The strawberry coulis was tartfully brilliant. And whatever dairy substitue they used was a superb standin. At least, I could not tell the difference. Forget the best vegan, this was one of the best eaton mess' I've ever had.The place itself is big, spacious, and has a nice feel to it. I went here with my wife and kid along with a friend and not once did I feel like we've been relegated to some cramped corner. Also, the wait staff is wonderfully patient and helpful. Definitely coming here again, and this time, not just for the eaton mess.",

We had the bread with olive oil, courgette flower (chose the vegan prepared option), a glass of red wine, beer, and for the mains he had the thali while I had the Asian dumplings. The bread was ok, the wine and beer were ok, and the thail was just ok. I really liked the courgette flower and I loved my Asian dumplings!Staff are nice, ambience is lovely, and there is a lot of space at this restaurant which is really nice.I live pretty close to The Gate so I would not hesitate to go back.",

Still, I will continue to return, as veggie restaurants deserve all the support they can get! This time around I had the veggie burger - the menu was a lil misleading as I thought the patty would be made from jackfruit, (as using it as a meat substitute certainly seems to be the trend in California), but in this case it was just a garnish.It was filling, beautiful presented, though a little bland. My date's Latin-themed dish looked more tasty, so maybe I'll go with that next time!",

    "text": "The Gate was lovely, and big ups to them for letting us stroll in and get a quick seat without a reservation.Agreed with Joey C.'s comment that, from the outside, the restaurant is not particularly noteworthy - turns out, I've unknowingly walked past The Gate many a time. \u00a0Inside, however, the space really opens up and it feels light and uncluttered.There is a wide range of drink options - a nice wine list, and several gins (to pair with your tonic, natch) and tequilas on offer. \u00a0Being August the table jumped on some cider, Pimms and an Aperol Spritz. The last two were nicely presented with an extra flourish of whittled-down produce.The pakora starter was totally forgettable, though I couldn't fault anything specifically. I guess my attitude skews towards leaving pakoras for Indian restaurants, but this was one of the starters that was easily divisible by three so all of us could have a share.The server recommended the mushroom gnocchi as the stand-out entree, so 2/3 of us opted for that. The final plate was lovely; five round gnocchi (the read more like dumplings, frankly, than the traditional Italian gnocchi, but that's neither here nor there) over a bed of mixed mushrooms and some cheese crisps lain atop. For 14ish GBP/plate, it was not a large, hearty dish (despite its description). It was warm, not hot, and overly salted. The service was friendly and I'm sure they would have worked to fix the former quibble, but we were on a tight timeline for the night so it wasn't worth the trouble. Yelp note: so would I, as a meat-eater, prioritize this restaurant for a night out? Well no, probably not. But it's well situated pre-night out in Exmouth or Angel, or pre-/post-theatre at Sadler's Wells. \u00a0And nice to have a vegetarian restaurant or three in your arsenal to suggest to your veggie friends!",

The staff are really friendly and chilled.The thing that stops them being five stars is that their dishes are a bit hit and miss. I had a brilliant wild mushroom dish for a main but my sister had the artichoke hearts and they really didnt have much going on for them. The starters were ok but didn't wow, the deserts were all lovely though.I'd say this is a great place to go for a celebration with the vegetarian or vegan in your life - or if someone can't eat gluten/dairy/nuts. It will hold up to most people's expectations of a good restaurant, but have a decent chat to the staff about what their favorites/recommendations are before placing your order.",

    "text": "As one of my vegetarian friends was visiting me for the weekend, we went to The Gate, which is known for its international dishes and its inventiveness.What I wasn't prepared for though, was how beautiful the place actually is! High ceilings and well stock bar: always a winning combination!The starters were really rather good: the Mediterranean Peppers, filled with an artichoke & hazelnut paste, and served with tapenade and pesto, this dish was basically the sun on a plate. The peppers themselves were melty and artichoke paste had a very delicate, slightly sweet flavour, which worked really well against the stronger flavours of the accompaniments.The Three Onion Tart itself was absolutely flawless: thin, cheesey, flakey pastry covered with a smooth, creamy, leek-ey filling. I wasn't as much of a fan of the caramelized red onion sauce, which was slightly too sweet for my taste.For mains, the Wild Mushroom Risotto was fairly nice and well balanced, the Broccoli Flower Ravioli (which was really more of a gyoza-type thing) was a bit meh (but the accompanying wasabi & pumpkin puree was ace!). The winner dish though? *THAT* Aubergine Schnitzel! Silky-smooth grilled aubergines, layered with smoked cheddar, pesto, roasted red peppers and tomatoes. SO GOOD!All together, it wasn't bad but nowhere near as creative as I expected it to be, so I'm not sure I'll visit again. Or maybe just to try the desserts, as we didn't get a chance to do so this time!cakeandwhisky.wordpress.\u2026",

    "text": "Went to The Gate last night with a couple of friends. I'm always sneakingly suspicious of vegetarian restaurants, as I almost invariably am disappointed or leave hungry (save a few exceptions, like 'Millenium' or 'Greens' in San Francisco). The Gate fortunately met neither of those expectations: we were delighted, and left very full indeed!The service here is irreproachable. We arrived on time for our 9pm booking, but our table wasn't ready; however, our server told us to go to the bar, and order any cocktail off the list on the house. Now that's what I call turning a potential customer problem into a stellar customer experience! The cocktails were ok, but then again, I'm pretty picky about my drinks... so by and large, pretty decent drink (gin, pepper, strawberries on crushed ice).We all decided to share our starters, mains and desserts, so that we could experience as much of the food on the menu as possible.For starters, we ordered the Courgette Flower, Pumpkin and Potato Cake, and the Green Banana Fritters.The courgette flower had a perfect crunch, and was nicely tucked into a dry, crispy, batter, and it came with a side of lentils that made the dish nicely balanced. Wasn't too impressed with the banana fritters, but the harissa they came with was spot on. The potato cake was the heavier starter, and the stilton came through, but not too strongly, again, showing how the kitchen here is right on top of their flavour profiles and balance.The mains demolished us! We ordered to share: The Aubergine Teriyaki, the Wild Mushroom Risotto Cake, and the Beetroot Canenelloni.The Aubergine was probably the most strongly flavoured dish, and comes chargrilled and layered with coriander pesto, roasted red peppers, shitake mushrooms and horseradish, and is coated with crispy breadcrumbs and served on stir-fried noodles with a pickled ginger and mango salsa. Pretty explosive in taste, and really good.The favourite dish for my 2 friends was the Cannelloni. I was a bit fearful, as I hate beetroot, and anything that uses that word is usually something I don't end up going near. It's essentially a home-made pasta filled with Jerusalem artichokes, hazelnuts, goat's cheese and basil pesto, served on an artichoke pur\u00e9e and finished with salsa verde. This dish was absolutely fantastic, and if it wasn't for the risotto cake, would have been my favourite.The star for me was the Wild Mushroom Risotto Cake. It's copiously served with with pan/fried girolles, pied de mouton, oyster and paris brown mushrooms, with a cepe reduction sauce and finished with rocket and Twineham grange shavings in truffle dressing... Whoa. Amaaaaazing!!!!! The risotto was perfecly cooked, the cake formation slightly crispy but still moist, and flavours where wild and explosive. Really, really good, and literally the dish that pushed me to give this place at least 4 stars.The 5th star comes associated with the level of service we received last night. The wait staff were attentive, kind, humourous, helpful, and went out of their way to help us. When they saw us constantly dividing our dishes amongst ourselves, they'd come with additional plates, spoons or whatever to help. When we asked if the kitchen could set up our three desserts to be shared and equally portioned, they happily obliged. Rarely have I seen this in a London restaurant.Talking about desserts: the Orange marmalade & whisky croissant bread & butter pudding is my favourite, but the White chocolate & baileys cheesecake is worth a detour. The Banoffee pie? Tastes like any old Banoffee pie, to be honest. Good, but could do with some more 'eeeee'.In any case, The Gate is truly a gateway to a truly pleasurable vegetarian culinary experience. Is it high end ? No. But is it good, with a warm atmosphere, no 'phru-phru-posh-BS' ? Absolutely. Go there, and see for yourself :) Oh, and you will leave pretty full and satisfied!PS: The house wine, although cheap (17\u00a3), has a bit of a bite; we decanted it into the empty water flask on our table... got a whole lot better ;-).",
