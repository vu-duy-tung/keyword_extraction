And the eponymous MoH itself (a rich, buttery, salty-sweet custardy kind of thing) is truly a thing of great beauty indeed. Now, the decor is another matter. Last time I was there I amused myself by counting tiny pink fringed lampshades and I believe if I am not mistaken there are over 40. Along with the patterned carpet and cottagey Tudorbethan theme and crowds of tea-takers, it makes for a slightly claustrophobic atmosphere. Not fussed about anything but the food though. When the standards are this high it's best to shut up and enjoy. (Oh, and they do a decent pot of tea too.)",

They sell the famous, and unique, Maids of Honour cakes here (apparently eaten by Anne Boleyn). The tea rooms have a history that dates back to 1850. I have to say though, despite this history, I have never been particularly impressed with the Maids of Honour. The d\u00e9cor inside the tea rooms is almost cloyingly traditional, and sort of twee. The food served is also only average and the staff are not particularly friendly. Maybe I went on a bad day but I feel that the Maids of Honour does not compare well with other tea rooms in Kew, such as the Greenhouse and the Orangery in Kew Gardens.",

I suppose I was expecting pastries that would simply melt in my mouth and send me into euphoria, but what I got was just a basic scone that frankly, did not taste all that different to Tesco's.

It also must be on a tourist guide, because I see a lot of touristy types visiting this cafe. So it definitely attracts many people from around the world. I suppose this is because this place is the epitome of being English. You feel very sophisticated when you drink your tea - with your little finger out!Now on the food..I seriously loved jam and cream scones as a kid. \u00a0This place is right up my ally... as old English food goes straight to a soft place in my heart. The quality is very good - the scones are fluffy and home made. The sandwiches are traditional, which are simply cheese or cucumber. The last course is a choice of dessert to your taste. I had the coffee bun, which was lovely.I can definitely say I will be back again!",

I loved their savoury afternoon tea. Very fulfilling.This weekend, we decided to eat a hot meal here and I have to admit the gravy with the roast pork was much better than I've eaten in most places in London.Their specialties are their desserts & the Maids of Honour tarts? - I simply can't recommend them enough. a recipe dating from the time of Henry VIII. They also pack picnic baskets and rent all picnic paraphernalia. I'm excited to try this option next year when the weather is suitable to carrying a basket into the park.",

It is fried and you eat it with a fork, not a spoon. \u00a0You can think of it as simply another kind of sausage with the same size, shape, and texture, with the exception that it's black and has a rich but delicate flavor (U.K. \"flavour\") that is hard to describe but very delish. \u00a0Unlike most kinds of sausage or cured meats, it is not overly salty.The eggs I had were so fresh they glowed neon orange like tiny, protein-filled nuclear reactors. \u00a0While I normally am grossed out by baked beans, these worked well with the rest of the breakfast ensemble. \u00a0I never knew one could successfully grill a tomato without turning it to mush. \u00a0My tomato was fresh and perfectly made.A \"rasher\" of bacon, by the way is a slice. \u00a0And bacon, by the by, is cut differently in the U.K. \u00a0It doesn't come in neat, thin, perfectly linear strips as it does here in the states. \u00a0It's thick, chunky, asymmetrical, has more in common with slices of ham than the bacon we are accustomed to. \u00a0With extra cooking it can be made as crispy as our Yank bacon, but often it is served lightly fried with a good deal of give and flex in the denatured protein molecules. Although I am the greatest connoisseur and expert on the Great American Breakfast who ever lived--and its most staunch defender--I firmly believe in the cultural diversity of the breakfast experience. \u00a0From huevos rancheros of Mexico, to the desayunos of Honduras with sides of Gallo Pinto to the Full English, I believe that every breakfast tradition is made stronger through appreciation of all others, and by the cross-cultural fusion of all available breakfast elements.My friends, let us all be united by fat, protein, and sheaves of chlorophyll-based autotrophic carbohydrates, our stalks projecting upwards in pagan worship of the sun.I am very grateful to my lovely tour guide and to the able chefs of Maids of Honour for helping me overcome my prejudice towards blood pudding, and for facilitating my enjoyment of the Great Full English in all its glory.",

    "text": "When in Richmond/Kew it is a must to stop here for a takeaway of the famous Maids of Honour tarts. The eponymous tearoom in Kew Road has been selling the small sweet cheese curd pies since the 18th century. Even better if you'd prefer to stay for tea - the place is almost always packed (especially at weekends), so it would literally be your lucky day. :) The decor is indeed old fashioned, but charming - though I do wish the chairs were slightly more comfortable. The classic blue china is by Spode and you are served by uniformed staff. First time I went there I was torn between two pies and the lady behind the counter kindly treated me with two samples on a plate so I could sit down and make up my mind. :) This time I decided to go the whole hog and plumped for a proper afternoon tea. The sandwiches are small but perfectly formed, and all the classics are here: eggs, cucumber, roast beef, salmon, and cheese. The bread not being dry definitely a plus in my books. The two scones that followed were also small but perfect in texture and taste, the jam had bits of strawberries in it and real clotted cream is always a joy to behold. To finish things off you get to choose a cake or pastry and I went for the mini vanilla cake; you can really taste the vanilla while you delight on your handful of sweet, fluffy sponge. The small-ish sizes allow you to happily munch your way through the three tiers without feeling uncomfortably full. The pot of breakfast tea was lovely and the charming staff accomodating to my request of extra hot water (it seems to be a problem in some places, go figure). My friends had the chicken pie and the sunday roast, all plates licked clean. I can vouch for the pie myself: it's delicious.For \"desert\" (sorry, not sorry) we ordered a round of Maids of Honour + half a dozen to take away. They're that good and I will let you in a secret: they taste even better the next day. :) Go the full tourist and take a picture with the old Morris 8 parked in front, framed by pink climbing roses in the summer; instant Instagram appeal. :)",

We also tried their savoury high tea and we thought their leek quiche was excellent. Their chicken pie was outstanding, never had a pie outside of my mother's which was so good. Overall, the food was excellent, but expensive, \u00a37 for 2 tiny scones and tea and a slice of pie for \u00a36.50?? Service is pretty poor, no personal feel, rushed and disinterested.

I went there again last weekend with a few friends. It wasn't super busy that day. There was an empty table by the window, so we asked if we could sit there. The senior looking staff said to us, \"You can sit there, I don't mind, but we have no time to clean up (the table was full of plates, cups and pots), we are very busy.\" No smile, no nothing... We couldn't believe they actually said that to customers. Anyway, we sat down and waited for quite some time, then a young lady staff spotted us and cleaned the table for us and apologised. We didn't get the name of that staff, but she was very lovely and helpful. After quite a while, we were still waiting for our food, the people who arrived and ordered after us were already eating... The restaurant provides good food, but they need a proper manager to manage the place, it's a mess. Often take at least 15-20 mins before anyone comes take orders from customers. Or the staff will say, \"Give me 5 mins, I'll come back.\" Which you know, they never will. And very often there are a couple of staff chatting/serving one customer while leaving the whole place a chaos.",

I had never visited it as I thought it would be one of those places that looked nice from the outside but was a big disappointment. Also after reading the yelp reviews I wasn't wowed by it.As I was nearby I popped in, I think me and my boyfriend were the youngest people in here, it wasn't a trendy cafe where you'd see lots of beards, asymmetric \u00a0haircuts, high buns and mismatched cutlery, instead it was a warm, cosy little tea room where the staff all wore matching uniforms and you felt like your gran had scooped you up and put you there-it was lovely, warm and inviting.Firstly to get the bad points out of the way, the service was incredibly slow but I'll allow this as the place was heaving and i had such a great experience.We sat in the garden, it was so nice being surrounded by the hanging baskets and flowers, the outside is only small but a bit nicer then the inside which seemed a bit cramped and stressful.We ordered a cheese and leek quiche slice at around \u00a33.75 each and afternoon tea for 1 at \u00a36.95 which we shared. This came with 2 small scones and a pot of tea with extra hot water to refill, you could get about 4 cups of tea each. We had the assam tea which was lovely and I thought the scones were light and fluffy and much better then the ones I had when I visited the Ritz! The quiche was a good size and melted in my mouth, sadly it didn't come with a small salad or anything.All in all i will definitely be going back when the sun is out or I might take away some of the quiche's, pasties they had on offer and go sit on kew green",
