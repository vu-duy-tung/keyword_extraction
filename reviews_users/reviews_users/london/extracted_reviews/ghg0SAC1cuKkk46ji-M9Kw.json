Its a great little cafe near Clapham Common tube station that makes relatively consistently good coffee (as evidenced by the large contingency of Aussies that frequent this place - but then again, its Clapham and so Antipodeans are a given)...Also stocks Konditor & Cook cakes and fresh pastries to go with your cuppa. There's a super cheap breakfast on the run deal - small coffee & plain croissant for \u00a32.20 - which is basically the price of a coffee elsewhere...Haven't tried their sangas yet but have heard good things from reliable sources and the staff are always friendly, as is the cute regular waiter whom I've yet to pluck the courage to flirt casually with...Overall, well worth a visit, though space is a premium.",

You also get honey with it! They also do sandwiches/paninis and Tyrell's crisps, as well as soft drinks and home made cakes - I also got offerred a taster of home-made brownie on my way out which was divine - totally yummy without tasting overly fatty or sugary like some chain cafes' food cheats by being. Will definitely go back there! It's a brand new business so I was really impressed with how good value it is. Very much recommend.",

Snuggled on the South side of Clapham Common is this adorable coffee shop with really comfy chairs. It's just perfect for a Sunday catch up with friends, they serve up fruit bread, and yummy cakes and even have a suprising clean toilet.The coffee is Italian and the baristas are so friendly, they obviously haven't heard you have to be obnoxious to serve up good stuff. And this coffee is good, tasty even. It's not a roast I've had before but it curbed my caffeine fix.During the week this is a hot spot with wifi and loads of seating. It's a gem in the south.",

So we drank coffee and hot chocolate whilst pretending the rain might end. I kept noticing little bits that I liked more.

They do great baguettes which are stuffed with fillings (and toasted for you if so desire).The room is not large, so not a massive amount of seating.. but if you can bag the couch at the back, it is a fantastic spot to chill, have some cake and coffee. They also have free wifi if you want to come in here with your laptop.But the best thing about this place is their consistently fantastic coffee, in particular their piccolo latte (like a normal latte, but with half the milk, makes for the perfect espresso and milk ratio in my opinion). Add to that friendly service, makes for one of my favourite places to get coffee!",

However, they call themselves a 'Coffee House' and the owners claim to be passionate about good coffee. I will judge them on that- and their coffee is simply not up to scratch- overheated, tounge-scorching lattes served with too much foam, crema-free espressos and lots of bad practice at play- failing to clean portafilters and equipment between shots at one time and re-steaming milk endlessly during another visit. Most of their staff apart from one are unable to free-pour drinks. Not entirely sure why they opted to use an Italian roaster for their beans (6 weeks on a truck = stale by the time it gets to the UK) when there are plenty of world-class roasters in London supplying top-notch award-winning coffee. Coffee bags displayed with pride in the window- because, as we know, coffee loves direct exposure to sunlight and heat. Tall Italian barista also enjoys telling customers how they want their coffee rather than the other way around. By all means support independent cafes, but not when they are in need of this much improvement....",

It's not quite a latte, not quite a shake, but something in between, as it isn't blended, but has a hefty scoop of premium Italian gelato plopped right on top of some of the best quality coffee I've had thus far. The strong, robust flavor of the caffeine is perfectly balanced by the slightly-sweet creaminess of the vanilla gelato. The only thing I would say was off about this drink was the fact that, when drinking something thick with ice cream or gelato in it, one gets the urge to mix the liquid of the coffee with the slight solidity of the gelato, which is made more difficult by the big cubes of ice rolling around in there. It makes drinking it a bit awkward.So be sure to ask for a spoon!",

Both coffee houses looked neat and since the husband and I had no clue about either of them, we just selected one and went for it. The Black Lab it was.The menu is not your typical coffee shop menu. It's a simple menu and, you know what, simple is good sometimes. Simply select the number of ounces, the type of bean and pay. I ordered the 6oz Columbian (came with steamed milk) and I should have ordered the 160,000oz size instead because it was delicious.Service was sweet and smiley. They thanked us for participating in the charity run even though they had no idea what charity we ran for, aside from the obvious being something to do with elephants as we were wearing elephant onesies.If I ever find myself south of the river again, I will definitely return to The Black Lab for a cuppa.P.S. The sandwiches and cakes looked delicious.",

I'm happy to report that those claims are NOT unfounded, I had some of the most delicious coffee I've had around the world at The Black Lab. I like to think of myself of a bit of a coffee snob, myself - being that I was formally trained as a barista in Australia.The staff was warm and welcoming and their passion for delivering the perfect cup of coffee shone through. Their knowledge about different extracting techniques, the origin of the beans and the resulting tasting notes from various ways of having it served up was superb and definitely made the experience that much more enjoyable. I enjoyed The Black Lab Coffee House so much that I wound up there 2 mornings in a row for brekky & coffee. I had the Guatemalan roast - served up as a flat white (the 6oz), also served up iced. Both was were extremely enjoyable. Tried a Kenyan roast, which wasn't personally my favourite, but it was still nice to try and taste the difference. Enjoyed myself a bacon sandwich, and my boyfriend had the sausage roll and a couple of the cold pressed juices. My friend had a croissant and chocolate milkshake - which she described both as \"TO DIE FOR!\" Look forward to returning upon my next trip to London!",

They have freshly made food, cake and yoghurt and such, so if you are looking for a lazy breakfast or a coffee, I'd go here first.The only thing is, you are in Clapham and the prices were quite high, but you are paying for the view and the location to",

It's not my style to worry too much about cost but I thought they were really quite extortionate here and decided not to buy anything. Probably over 50% more expensive than, say, The Common Room in Clapham South or Blackbird in Balham and others in Clapham Old Town. \u00a0I appreciate it's tough running a business these days and we all need to make money - but this is over the top.

Staff have always been friendly, kind, and patient when I procrastinate over which blend to go for ;) They are very knowledgable baristas, and plenty of innovative offerings, including cold press coffee. Simple decor, clean lines. Nice outdoor space, diagonally overlooking the Common - time it right and you can bask in sunshine during good weather whilst enjoying your caffeine fix.",

    "text": "Where I do start? I have wanted to review The Black Lab for a long time now and finally, finally, I can do it! Black Lab was my original \"go to\" local coffee shop. This was before the opening of Brickwood a few doors down. Why, I went to a competitor, I'm not sure. Maybe it was because Brickwood was owned by an Australian guy and it reminded me of home. I don't know. Maybe it was because Black Lab doesn't open till 7:30am and sometimes, I just want a coffee at 7am. Opening late, however, seems to be a pretty common trend with coffee shops in London. What do the people of London drink when they have to go to work before 7:30am?? However, I have started frequenting Black Lab again and it is still just as good. Albeit they have changed a little bit. I noticed that they now have more of a sandwich and cake selection and I think that they have changed their coffee supplier. You can choose the blend of coffee that you want (house or guest blend) and they can brew your coffee in about a thousand different ways. You can have your standard latte or flat white, or you can have the filter coffee with a different blends, or you can have the cold drip. It's all a little too much sometimes i.e. today I ordered a flat white and when it was delivered to the table, it was announced as a \"6 ounce Guatemalan\". After a bit of confusion, we realised that it was the flat white I ordered...Either way if you want a decent coffee, you can't go past Black Lab!",

    "text": "The location is perfect. Right on Clapham common, where most businesses make money irrespective of the quality of their offerings. However this is the real deal. Their coffee is very good, always roasted to perfection and never burnt. That's a good sign as nearby Starbucks and Nero have a tendency for overroasted coffee servings. There's a nice aroma to their coffee, different than other upscale coffee houses like Monmouth. I'm assuming it's for people who like a less italianised flavoured espresso.Foodwise, I've only tried their red velvet cake and I was impressed on how similar it tasted to the Hummigbird's, yet it didn't look as inviting as the latter. The rest of the cakes and pastries on offer seemed pretty standard for a coffeehouse, nothing out of the ordinary.So why 5 stars? Because it's close to where I live, its good and I consider it a better alternative to chains.",

I had the green goddess sandwich; its delights included goats cheese, pesto and avo (have it toasted!). The show-stealer though was the brownie - freshly in that morning, they were the gooiest, richest, deliciousestestest yumminess ever. But very sickly. Definitely shareable, and recommended to have tea with it to cut through the richness rather than a milky latte like I had!",

Good for weekend brunch or takeaway for a stroll round the common, not grabbing a quick coffee before work. Great range of coffees and brewing techniques including cold brewed. The new concept of choosing your coffee blend and then the amount of milk seems a bit pretentious but is actually quite useful once you get to grips with it.",
