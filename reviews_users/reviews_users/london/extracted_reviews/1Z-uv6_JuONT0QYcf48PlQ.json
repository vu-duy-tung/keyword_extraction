It took over 15 minutes for someone to come and ask if I want a drink. 11 minutes later I had to ask one of the waiters what's going on. This is completely unacceptable as they aren't even that busy. So I'm dropping it to 2 stars.It's rather annoying that they stop serving brunch (breakfast) at 11.30am. This has thwarted me before as its become the norm in London to have a brunch past midday at most of the usual quality brunch spots.But then, they do call it breakfast here, which is correct and traditional but not in keeping with the 21st century :)On to the food then.What can I say? Everything is delicious. The only reason I am dropping a star is that I can't have it when I want to have it! The atmosphere is lovely; light and airy with high ceilings and a feeling of space. Terrible service is letting this place down. Sort it out guys!",

While as much a staple to UK fare as hamburgers are to us in the US, as a regular traveler to London, I have had my share of the epicurean comfort food and this presentation and the taste were massive. An absolutely brilliant \u00a0meal. As the picture shows, the piece of cod was huge (not a single bone to have to deal with), and placed on top of the hand-cut, homemade chips. A separate dish of mushy peas accompanied the meal, along with perhaps the best made from scratch (I asked) tartar sauce I have ever had.Service was very attentive and unlike some other places, the server actually spoke and understood English! Ask for Eva. She was really great. The entree came out quickly, but we were not rushed and enjoyed an outstanding meal. No good meal is complete without a proper sweet or pudding at the end. Natural Kitchen had several from which to choose. I had a plain dish of strawberry and vanilla ice cream...with the emphasis being on the \"creamy.\" Delicious and a generous portion. Enjoyed the experience and food quality so much that I am heading back tomorrow night with 3 businesss colleagues over from the states.",

They have an amazing selection of Organic and vegan wine (yes that's a thing!) And each dish is beautifully presented. Every time I am in the area I would come back here and highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a nice and healthy meal. The ambience is also very sweet, and the servers for the most part were very helpful and knowledgeable.",

We sat outside and ordered fish and chips, soup of the day... mushroom soup...yum. Hubby had a salmon burger which he enjoyed. Elderflower bubbly drink is light and refreshing on warm days. We loved it and would definitely recommend.",

Excellent.Chicken breast burger, which came with tarragon coleslaw and sweet potato fries. The sandwich was huge and the fries were nicely baked.

First, the ambience is just great...glass windows to the vaulted ceiling, farmhouse style tables, very, very clean, and part of the restaurant is more for popping in and working cafe style. Second, the food is excellent, and since we ended up eating there for breakfast and our evening meal 4 times in all, we experienced quite a selection. Third, the entire staff was accommodating, friendly, and extremely professional and gracious. Raman (hope I'm not butchering the spelling) was above and beyond on our service, as well as being extremely thorough in regard to making sure the food was allergy safe, and even went the extra mile to look up and disclose the ingredients in our food. The juice bar creations were awesome to boot! I couldn't give this place more stars or I would! Go there! Your belly and tastebuds will thank you. Oh! If you happen to read a bad review from a grumpy, miserable old wretch of a human being, please don't pay it any mind. The woman two tables over in our last night was unbelievably rude to all the staff, and her complaints were not valid...bickering that she ordered a one shot latte and going through the roof insisting, with almost vulgar language, that it was not made properly and when she sat down she immediately started complaining about the food from her prior visit not being satisfactory \u00a0(which leads one to wonder why she returned on the first place). She was so horrible that the table seated next to her asked to be moved after having to listen to her horribleness at close range. Incidentally, while I would have asked the woman to leave, Raman handled allllll of her unsubstantiated complaints with grace and aplomb. Slow clap for the patient staff at Natural Kitchen. :)",

Everything else is clean wood and the little box bouquet of fresh herbs on each table is a nice touch.I got the crab & crayfish linguine based on a solid recommendation, and it was all kinds of tasty, albeit it's like walking into a wall of cream. Two of us who got the dish asked for a lemon wedge to cut back the acid, but fans of cheesy creamy comfort food would love this.",
