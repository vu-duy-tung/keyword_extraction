    "text": "I go to Bone Daddies Soho often - I am pork-averse and they make an all chicken ramen which I really like. \u00a0I tried the Kensington location and was very disappointed. \u00a0The broth was cold, underseasoned, noodles were undercooked (very firm - esp when compared w Peter St. location), chicken was dry, the egg was sliced 80/20 and ice cold (instead of cut 50/50 so you had two delicious bites of yolky creaminess),and my chicken karaage arrived after having finished my ramen.Decided not to post a review because I like the Soho location and rather, send an email to management. Their reply completely ignored my negative experience, bar the broth which they said couldn't have been underseasoned because (a) its made in a central kitchen, and (b) people in the past have complained of it being overly salty. \u00a0I fail to see why (a) a central kitchen is more consistent than any other kitchen, and (b) why, if at some point it was deemed overly salty, why this time it couldn't be undersalted?They ignored mentioning the noodles, shredded chicken, karaage, egg, and said I should have voiced my opinion at the time if I had an issue. \u00a0I mean, yes, had I wanted to spend more time waiting, and complaining (which is not very enjoyable) I could've done so, but I thought a very considerate letter to the company was a very good alternative option (esp. because I was extremely complimentary towards the Soho location). I did not ask for anything and did not want a refund.The service was polite - but frankly -- if your side dish comes after your main its a bit difficult to say it was up to par (I asked for the chicken at the same time as the ramen, not before, as I enjoy dipping it in the broth). \u00a0Very very poor customer service from Bone Daddies HQ. \u00a0It would've been extremely easy to just reply - oh you poor dear, I'm so glad you had a bad experience and will talk to our staff - I was sending it to them so they knew anyhow. The reviews are bad on Yelp, and other sites so maybe listen to constructive criticism rather than be a dick about it.All said and done, I'll still happily goto BD Soho because it's very very good.",

The effort to get service undermined the experience and the atmosphere to such a degree, I may not bother or want to come back again.The front of house lady did all she could, but that did not reduce the suffering and frustration of the experience.",

Maybe to others, but here I clearly did the mistake. On the bright side : plenty of space to sit, fast delivery, nice staff, and many other delicious otpions on the menu to try.

Granted the restaurant was not even a third full.I only ordered one dish, the Tantamen Ramen. My hopes were up when my waitress warned me that it was very spicy and was I sure I wanted to order it!Boy was I disappointed when within 2 minutes appeared a medium size bowl with a thick layer of reddish oil on top and a murky creamy broth underneath. Inside the bowl, 1 bok choy leaf, 1 small spinach leaf, some ground pork, 1 whole boiled egg sliced in two with slightly runny egg yolks and a small portion of noodles. Null points for presentation but as they say it is all about the taste.What a let down! First the soup tasted tepid warm, most unusual for ramen which should be served piping hot. Second the broth tasted like a thickened sickly peanut sauce. Don't ever recall ever having anything remotely like that in Japan. Third and most disconcertingly it tasted bland; where was the promised spice! I suspect the peanut/sesame sauce/broth neutralized any attempt at spicing this dish up. To add insult to injury, I turned to the chili oil jar on the table to liven up the dish. It was bland too! Or maybe it just tasted bland since my mouth was still coated with broth!. So all I ended up doing was adding oil to an already oily dish. Lastly, the ramen noodles were overcooked and unappetizing to eat as they had formed into a sticky blob and sunk to the bottom of the bowl.All in all this particular dish is a disaster and particularly poor value for \u00a311.",

The menu was simple and has a bit of something for everyone. We went with a salmon yuzu starter and then went with a regular ramen and a spicy ramen both turned out delicious. I have to say the broth was a bit rich for my taste but I found the added egg that was soft boiled in soy was a nice touch of added flavor. Since they have just opened I give it a pass, I am sure they will have time to perfect it like their other locations.",

The food: I ordered a fried salmon bun & the Tantanmen with chicken. The fried salmon bun was exquisite. I initially the bun lacked flavor but that was before I reached the pickled carrots. The combination of the salmon & carrots was beautiful & I truly enjoyed it. I wish I could say the same for the ramen. The broth lacked real substance. It tasted as if the chef had yet to discover salt. I tried to add some flavor by adding two spoonfuls of chili paste but even that couldn't redeem it. Maybe it was just a bad day, but it was not enjoyable for me. The service: My friend & I were seated promptly, the restaurant was starting to fill up so we waited patiently for our serve to take our order. You really just have to flag them down & they'll be happy to take your order. When we got our appetizer I had asked for a sauce from a young gentleman & he said he would go ask what would pair well. But I saw him walk around the restaurant for a good 5 minutes looking lost & checking on other diners, then when taking our plates away he said \"I'm sorry I was too busy to ask for a sauce\". Well, that's apparent. I understand that it can be overwhelming to have to serve so many people, but I do not think expressing to a customer that you were too busy for them is good for business. All-in-all I enjoyed the free WiFi & spending time with my friend.",

Great view of the street to people watch but there was something lacking in the generally good bowl of ramen.It's a bit hard to be rock'n'roll when you are located in a Whole Foods' food court but they still retained their loud music. Service was a bit touch and go. Lacked much vibe or energy.The food was decent. I had the seasonal garlic tantanmen. Pork chasu, minced pork, some spice, egg, bok choy and bamboo shoots. Broth was flavourful but didn't taste like it had been brewing for hours. Overall it's a good bowl of noodles, however I prefer the Soho location, which gives you more bang for your buck.",

    "text": "I was quite surprised to discover an entire food court above whole foods in our quest for bone daddies.The current spell of weather has me constantly seeking out soup and ramen kind of eateries. \u00a0After a trip to the design museum, was trying to find a place for early dinner and \"nearby\" search on yelp, revealed bone daddies that I had previously bookmarked. While it is set in a food court, bone daddies has its own space for diners, so once you enter, you do get a restaurant feel. We arrived early around 6:30, but there were already a few tables occupied with people sharing small plates and drinks from their extensive menu.We settled on a jasmine tea and carrot orange juice respectively (alcohol detox diet is on, otherwise I would have loved to try some of the exciting sakes on the menu) The table had an array of condiments - spicy chilli paste (vegetarian, no shrimp, yay for me), sesame seeds, garlic marinated vinegar. The lady kindly got us some extra chilli oil when I asked for my ramen to be spicy.They also offered hair ties (elastic bands) and plastic bibs. Such a thoughtful gesture for eating ramen. He had, had a late lunch and didn't want a main course, but I was really hungry. So we settled for multiple small plates and one main. The fried chicken went well with wasabi mayo dip that accompanied the chicken summer roll. I do think the fried chicken deserved the dip more than the roll. The chilli pork bao was lovely, but I was surprised to only receive one piece (a previous picture on this group may have skewed my expectations) It was large, so we cut it in half to share.The pickled shiitake was perfect for what I wanted (cutting the viscous texture of the tonkotsu ramen) The ramen was perfect. I liked the lower proportion of noodles to veggies. And I had ordered extra mushrooms and pork. While I prefer a higher proportion of protein and veg to carb, I have to admit that \u00a0I could have enjoyed a lot more of the noodles (you have the option to order extra) They were really good.The little mochi ice cream balls were perfect. Not too sweet, just a hint of sweetness. I tried the yuzu, hazelnut and chocolate & despite being a chocoholic, I have to say the yuzu & hazelnut were much preferred. I now know where I'm going for dinner anytime I'm on Kensington high street in the evenings. There's so much more in the starters menu that I want to try and I love their version of the tonkotsu ramen.",

    "text": "I'm obsessed with bone daddies. The mushroom ramen is what I will always get. That was because it was the one veggie based one but since I started coming they also have a tofu curry ramen. I found that to be a tad too spicy and the broth didn't have as rich or deep of flavour as the mushroom. The tofu curry had padron peppers which are nice and also deep fried tofu- super heavy and delicious but overall not as good. The mushroom ramen dish has mushroom butter (still don't know what that is), mushrooms, an egg, pak choi, tofu, asparagus and noodles. I love the noodles and the broth. It's the best ramen I've had in London and maybe ever but I'm still deciding that. ;)",

For dessert we had the green tea mochi ice cream. The consistency of the mochi was just right: soft, thin and chewy just the way I like it! Interesting tip: each table has a container filled with hair ties, so if you need one they got one ready for you. How cool is that!?Worth trying! I'll be making another trip for sure.",

We were finished eating and no sign of the bun so I asked about it. After another 15 minute wait still no bun another waitress came around to take our empty plates (I only had one in front of me) and I pointed at it and said I never got my bun. Some more waiting and I asked again and I was asked if I was sure I didn't get because they were sure I did. How since they just took my one and only tiny plate? Where do they think the bun was? Also don't argue with the client. Well I did get the bun 25min after my friends finish eating. There was no apology and I paid for my bun. And was asked again while paying if I was sure I didn't get it to begin with. It should have been takes off my bill. I should have been given an apology. Very badly handled situation. A simple mistake that could've been fixed quickly and without questions.",

Hair tie jar is REAL. We wondered if they're new or used.... Korean spicy chicken was good. The beans were good too. A bowl of ramen runs 11-14 pounds.

London has come a long way from that kind of ramen thankfully.So ramen specialists, Bone Daddies, have been highly successful and are almost a mini-chain in London. Can their standards be maintained? LFM is glad to report that the ramen served in the High St Kensington branch is spot on. The 20 hour pork broth was rich and luscious. The cherry on the top, or in this case, a deep fried soft shell crab, perfected the dish. LFM also sampled the Korean deep fried chicken wings starter which was satisfying and tasty although we've had better elsewhere with a less 'industrial' taste.The restaurant is based in the top floor food court of Whole Foods which gives it a rather casual vibe. This is perfect for bringing the little ones with high chairs available and plenty of room for buggies. Nice (and slightly odd) touches were the additions on the table of bibs, hair ties and garlic crushers.Extremely happy with this opening in SW London and hurrah, no need to trek into central London with the bulky buggy for that ramen fix. londonfoodiemama.wordpre\u2026",

They both have something different to offer which I appreciate.My favourite ramen is the new one with softshell crab which is so thick and salty but because of the fish stock, it just goes perfect with the taste of the sea. If I have a starter, I can never finish my ramen (even when in group) but I would still recommend getting soft buns or brussel sprouts (which are way more amazing than I though just from the sound of it).",

    "text": "I've been to the Bone Daddies in Soho and have to say that I prefer this one in Whole Foods as it's more spacious, has better seating and the music isn't blaring so loud as they have it at the Soho branch. It's definitely more family friendly too I'd say. The Soho branch can get very busy especially in the evenings and you may need to wait outside. Not sure how busy the Whole Foods store gets as we came for lunch but if you have to wait, at least you're not standing outside!It's also great that the menu here is a mix of Bone Daddies and Flesh & Buns and includes hirata buns. I had the T22 chicken ramen which has a rich broth full of flavour. You also can't go wrong with the tonkotsu ramen too. Would recommend this place.",
