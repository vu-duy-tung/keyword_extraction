I do not have a problem at all with the food but it shouldn't take 20-25 minutes to get an egg sandwich. I understand they are busy but I work 12 hour days during the week and every minute of my weekends are important. When I finally asked about it they said there was another order ahead of me. Hopefully they are no making one order at a time. I was late two weekends in a row for events because it wasn't a quick breakfast to go. I am writing this update so others can be warned if you don't get there VERY EARLY make sure have plenty of time to wait.",

Looking at the menu, I noticed that all the \"condiments\" were extra: Cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, tomato... all extra. So my $6 sandwich ends up being $2 extra when your done with topping it. Ive never heard of a deli place charging you for standard items on a sandwich. My sandwich, plus a side of mac salad and drink was $12. KInda steep. Food was good though, no issues there, and they were doing a good brisk business when I was there. The breakfast items seem priced better, so I may try that.",

You can make a bagel deli sandwich but you can't heat up a piece of Taylor ham and put it on the bagel. When we decided to go somewhere else they allowed us to walk out & didn't say a word.  Since my last post, I've been back (before 12). The Taylor egg ham and cheese bagels are amazing. The coffee is roster and brought down from NY and is amazing. Better than DD!

The word Deli is from NY but this deli does not compare to a real NY deli. Place is clean but unfortunately everything I have had lacked luster. I really wanted to love this place but it fell short of my expectations. In comparison to NY deli portion sizes seem small , sandwich bread is bland, home fries were lacking flavor.Maybe a trip to the 5 boroughs could kick it up a notch.  Bottom line if your from the boroughs and know your deli this won't cut it. Just go in expecting less than I did and you'll be ok.They do carry boars head which is a plus but so does Harris teeter .",

These bagels remind me of NY (no not the city). I bought one of each: salt bagel, everything egg, cinnamon/sugar, Asiago cheese, jalapeno, and a plain bagel. So far I've tried the everything, cinnamon, and Asiago cheese. They're all fabulous!! I was a bit overwhelmed when I first walked in as there was no rhyme or reason as to where to go. However, once one worker was freed up she came right over to take my order. Soon as she finished bagging my bagels I was off to the register. I can't wait to go back and try breakfast or lunch. I will now buy my bagels from her as well.",

The decor is kinda plain, and looks a bit unfinished. But that didn't take away from the experience.  The prices were very reasonable.  I will be going back.

The entire bagel was covered with sesame seeds not just the \"top\".  Tasted fresh.  They have plain and flavored coffees in pump urns so you can choose what you want.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is the cheese was a slice of American and I think a bagel this good should be paired with real cheese and because the bagel was barely toasted.  Those nit picky issues didn't stop me from buying a half dozen to go.  Oh and the prices are extremely reasonable.",

The one thing that caught my attention was the hours on the door. They are open from 7am-3pm. Then when we walked in to check it out, they have a case will the desserts that took me back to my childhood....specifically the cookies with the jelly filling. Needless to say, we stayed and ordered a Reuben with corned beef and a Reuben with pastrami. We ordered two sides, the macaroni salad and the Italian pasta salad. The Italian pasta salad had cheese and salami in it. I felt like I was back at a Jewish deli like when I grew up. We ordered bagels to go and a few sides. We will definitely be making more visits here. This place is everything.",

It's clearly a favorite spot because it was full of people, which made it ultra confusing for someone that's never been inside.  There were no signs and the employees weren't wearing uniforms or name tags so I really couldn't tell who worked there or where to place my order.  There seemed to be too many people behind the counter that all did different functions.  I finally placed my order and realized the only drinks were bottles (sigh) so I made myself as small as possible amongst the other people waiting in the very small space and hoped they'd call my name soon.    Business is obviously good for the deli, but I don't do well in such tight spaces with so many people... certainly not worth all this for a simple bagel.  I'm glad business is good for them, but I will not be back.",

One day I plan to try them for lunch but for now I'll share my enthusiasm for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. I get it on the egg bagel as a combo with a cup of coffee which rings up to a little under $5. I'd be in serious trouble if this was on my way to work instead of the opposite direction.   The owners are very friendly and service is always so quick. The pump your own coffee comes in a variety of flavors and is always hot and fresh. The price is good for the quality of the breakfast and the atmosphere is very inviting. This is a stop worth making!",

A little confusing where to place an order and pay, if you are not familiar with the place.   Store has a few tables inside and outside. But definitely, they need to upgrade. Too small.  Couldn't sit and decided to take out. I don't know why but it took them more than 20 minutes for my order.  It was a little frustrating.   However, I understood that they could easily mess it up, due to the high volume of orders they have.  I got a bacon egg & cheese in a poppy bagel for $3.99 and a coffee. (breakfast special).  Customer service could use a boost especially when busy like it normally is.  Overall breakfast is fresh and flavorful and chewy bagels.   Nothing fancy but good food.  Never stopped yet for lunch.  The home fries are to die for!  And you have different options to choose with the bagels and cream cheeses.  Be back soon. Need to try more breakfast's options and lunch.",

The food:  Ruben (w/corn beef)- hubby favorite  Ruben's brother (w/pastrami)- my favorite; because it's juicer and saltier!   Overall, I was glad I got half of each; because they were, so packed with meat.  By the end of 1 half of a sandwich, I was glad I had a different meat.   Kids got:  Plain bagel with grape jelly- ate the whole bagel!  Asiago bagel with cream cheese- too big for the younger kid; but she really enjoyed it.

My friend and I shared a rueben, a Rueben's brother, macaroni salad, pasta salad and coffee cake. I also had a cold brewed iced coffee. All I can say is that it was REAL coffee. I took home bagels and chicken salad. They were all great. The bagels are best I have had in the south. Everyday I wish I were closer to this deli.  I almost left out the pickle. It was to die for.",

Neighbors like this place a lot and rave it about it - couldn't agree.  Hubby ordered Italian Sandwich & I had Cuban Pannini.  I liked the Pannini but Hubby couldn't eat the 2nd half of his sandwich for pulling out the strings from his cold cuts which no one on the line or making his sandwich bothered to do.  I felt punished for asking for a cup for water which was very small (maybe 4-6 oz) I had to refill numerous times.  I don't think we will return,  We didn't feel welcomed at all and I want to feel that way when I spend my hard earned money.  People who love it may be from the North, like the owners.  Next time I'll stick to my normal Saturday lunch spot next door. I don't think they will see me again.",

I was stuck between giving a 4 and a 5 but after finishing my salad, definitely had to lean towards that 5. Walked in on a Saturday a little before they closed to get a to go order. Chopped salad for myself which was absolutely amazing. I had them mix my lettuce, so I got a mix of spinach, spring lettuce and romaine and added avocado, mushrooms, carrots, feta cheese and ranch dressing. They chopped it up for me and I'm here to tell you it was banging!!! I ordered my husband an Italian sandwich and asked for it to be on white bread instead of a sub roll. I also asked for no tomatoes or red peppers. Well I got home and it was on a sub roll instead of the white bread. And then they still added the red peppers. Not a big deal, I pulled the peppers off for him and he said it was good, he just obviously wished it was on the white bread like I asked and then wished it had more romaine lettuce on it. It had one teeny tiny piece of lettuce on it. Lastly, I got a pound of egg salad for a friend. It was good! I contemplated maybe keeping it for myself. I love how they have homemade pasta salads and such that they sell by the pound. I will be back!",
