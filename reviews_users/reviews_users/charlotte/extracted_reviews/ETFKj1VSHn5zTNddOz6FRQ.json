    "text": "Good grief, people, it's a chain restaurant. You pretty much know what you're going to get when you come here: decent food, plenty of it, at a reasonable price. If you go in expecting the best food you've ever had, you're gonna have a bad time. Recognize that this place calls itself \"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers\" for two reasons: 90% of the people who eat here equate \"big and messy with lots of stuff on it\" with \"good burger,\" and \"Red Robin Really Big and Messy Burgers That Taste Pretty Ok\" didn't test as well with focus groups.   If you want a really good burger, go to a specialty burger joint that's not a chain. If you want a big burger loaded with a lot of flavorful things like bacon, jalapenos, avocado, and barbecue sauce, accompanied by a ton of fries and a frosty adult beverage, Red Robin would be a good choice.   Is it truly gourmet? Not hardly. Is it gourmet enough for most Americans? Definitely.   Anyway, I went to this location while in town on business. Nothing that I wasn't expecting, and just what I was looking for: a decent burger, some fries, and a frosty adult beverage on the company's dime. Service wasn't the best I've ever had but was perfectly acceptable, the food was plentiful and tasty, the beer was cold, and the company paid for it. Nothing to complain about.   In the future, folks, when you write a review of a chain restaurant, rate it according to your expectations of it as a chain, and don't try to be a food critic.",

It was actually really cold in the restaurant and I was a little on the uncomfortable side because of it.    My server was very friendly and was almost too friendly.  She was super nice.  She had my drink refills at my table before I was finished with my first one.   The hamburger was tasty and very warm.  The fries were not crispy or hot and so I had to take off a star for that.   I really liked the personal devices at the table to pay your bill, browse through the menu, and even request refills and appetizers.",

We watch other servers tend to their customers quickly while ours didn't. I would see her trying to blame other people for the poor service to her other tables. We were there for over two hours which is ridiculous for this type of restaurant. When we left my husband told the manager their service was horrible...his only response was \"what really??\" No, apologies whatsoever.  Also we love the strawberry freckle lemonade.

The shrimp tacos were very good. The shrimp were grilled to perfection and the cabbage added a nice crunch and the avocado mellowed every thing out. Now my mac and cheese on the other hand, I give 3 thumbs down. It was literally boiled pasta with no butter, milk or cheese with a drizzle of cheese like substance on top. I brought this to the waiters attention and he told me that that's how they make their mac and cheese. Smh. I returned the fail that they call mac and cheese and got shrimp tacos instead.

Once time to pay the check the tablet wouldn't read the card so we informed the waitress and also asked for Togo boxes and Togo cups she attempted to swipe the card but it didn't work again and waitress walked off she was gone for about thirty minutes when she came back she went to the bar and stood and talked to someone sitting at the bar I literally had to yell across the restaurant to get her attention.

Again food was the same as the others (good) but staff is not as good - that's why this location gets 3 stars.",

Very poor service and we were accidentally charged for chips queso and entertainment fee for my 4 year old using the kiosk.Again no warnings on the fee for using the kiosk and no record for the wrong order of chips came from the kiosk. Absolutely pathetic not to warn the customers also no pleasantries by the server at the end after the check was processes. Really rude server with poor attitude.",

The university location seems to be fairly slow (not busy) but our server was nice enough.  We were there during peak lunch time and it was barely full.  I guess it's hard to get away from this place without dropping $12-15 dollars for lunch.  Granted it's a pretty hearty meal, but a bit expensive for lunch.  The dining room is kept clean and there is plenty of nick-knacks on the walls to look at to kill the time.  One thing that they have going for them is their \"special\" Red Robin seasoning, which unfortunately on my last trip was a bit solidified in the container which leads me to believe how long it has been sitting there or how NOT often they refill or keep that seasoning at it's best.  Mostly salt, but still.  If you are looking for a quick lunch... I wouldn't recommend this place since it was pretty relaxed.  I could see myself getting easily annoyed if I was trying to get somewhere since our server seemed to have fair command over the section, but it felt like the getting the checks took forever.",

One waitress who no longer works there knew my parents' order by heart, which they loved and now another waitress is trying to do the same thing. :)  Who can beat bottomless fries? We always ask for them to bring some before the food comes since they are so yummy. I love getting them with buzzard wing sauce and ranch dipping sauce and covering them with that special spice they have on the table. My mom gets the side salad, which is also unlimited and they bring that before the food also by request.  My favorite entrees are the Royal Red Robin (burger with an egg over easy on top and bacon, which I get on the side and take home for my dog) and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. I ordered the adult chicken tenders and fries and the Tavern Double one time each and I liked them both also, but not enough to choose over my favorite entrees. I got the macaroni and cheese as an additional side once, but it was very filling (it was bottomless and I still couldn't even finish half) and I'd never choose it over the fries.   I ordered the Buzz Tavern Double once and I hated it. It's a double cheeseburger with special spicy sauce and mac and cheese in between the patties. It sounds good in theory, but I don't recommend it! My dad said the same about the smoky tavern double.   Make sure to join their loyalty club because you get a free burger during your birthday month, a free entree after 10 meals purchased and coupons every week. We've gotten coupons for free appetizers before and we tried the fried pickles and the onion rings. Neither were anything special and we never ordered them again. Besides, who needs apps with bottomless fries?  I'm not a big dessert person, but I ordered the birthday cake milkshake once and it was just ok. My sister likes the Cookie Magic shake. The other desserts sound good, but I've always gorged myself on too many fries to want to order them.   Red Robin is yummy, comforting and family friendly, so you have nothing to lose by stopping by when you can!",

We were told that no substitutions could be made and if replacing the patty for turkey burger or black bean would result in paying full price. We understood and paid for our meals, but was very disappointed to learn had we gone to the RedRobin at NorthLake, our diet needs wouldn't have demanded full price as they were accommodating teachers who didn't eat beef no additional charge.",

Then after five minutes of waiting we finally got seated and had to wait another five minutes for two waters. Our ready food sat in the window because the waitress had to help her two other tables. This will sound incredibly high maintenance, but RR changed their chicken tenders and they're disgusting. Didn't have the patience to talk to anyone because our waitress was constantly disappearing, kept hearing other servers ask where she was. Only good part of this trip was the lady with the red hair who eventually brought us our food and was quite pleasant. Other customers were even having issues too. Don't know what the heck is wrong with this location, but we will NOT be coming back. I'll make sure to spread the word too lol (I have been a server for 5 years and have a culinary degree, so it's not like I don't know what I'm talking about. Guess this is what I get for eating here.)",

As we spoke to her we realized that she was the bartender and also serving tables. I remember coming last time and they would use their employees in this way. As we observed her activity at the bar increased where she had to make everyone's drinks. But in doing that her attention to our table became less and less. To the point where we no longer were given refills and the bottomless steak fries were not replenished. It's not Sydney's fault, I just wish Red Robin would use their employees in a more suitable way.",

    "text": "This experience was the worst I have ever had in my 43 yrs of dining out... where should I start... We walked into the restaurant to be meet by a manager on a personal phone call and the hostess taking a extremely long togo order. The manager never even made an attempt to help or even greet anyone that was at the door... 15 minutes later, hostess still taking a togo order and manager still hanging out talking on the phone. finally we where greeted by a employee that looked like \"cousin It\"... HAIR EVERYWHERE.... PEOPLE CHECK YOUR FOOD... THIS GIRL IS A FOODRUNNER (the girl could only see out of one eye with hair covering the other one). Walking to the table we noticed that the restaurant was trashed.... I mean trashed... and no one cleaning up. We counted 20 tables that was full of trash and dirty dishes, probably still dirty because the girl couldnt see but with one eye.  After being sat, I went to the restroom only to be meet by what looked like was a bloody fight where someone lost control of themselves and peed everywhere.... seats, floors, sinks, mirror... I mean even the soap to wash your hands looked like it was diluted with pee. This should have been my sign to high tail it out of this restaurant but I didnt and I regret that decision... First server came to the table and took ower drink order and walked away then followed by a second server asking the same thing.. we told her someone had already be to the table so she walked away..... to be followed by a third server asking what we wanted to drink... we were told then that the foodrunner ,that can only see out of one eye, was asking everyone to take our table. guessing she couldnt see the person she originally ask and thought she was still talking with the first server... guess we will never know. We recieved our food in a timely manner, however, the burger that i ordered didnt come with any toppings... while waiting for the toppings we noticed not one, not two, or not even three hairs but six human hairs resting on my plate, on my fries, on the burger and once we received the burger topping there were two more hairs in the toppings.  Not exceptable. needless to say we left without eating a thing.... This experience is a prime example of poor managerment and lack of health standards.... I do not recommend this place to anyone....Red Robin, yall need to do alot better.... (hair tied back or in a hat... clean your bathroom and regularly check them... manager being more pro-active instead of just going through the motions... If i could give yall a negative rating it would be a -25 stars..",

The \"burger\" wasn't much better.  The mushrooms didn't have any garlic flavor like I was expecting.  It was a grilled chicken sandwich with cheese and boring mushrooms.

    "text": "When I decide to go out and eat by myself, it's a big deal for me. I realize I'm only going to spend $25 or $30, and that doesn't compare to a family of four or whatever, but I generally go out to eat with two or three of my friends, so treating me like I don't matter means that you've just negated future parties of three or four that will spend more. And I'm vocal. If my friends want to go out for lunch or dinner, and someone suggests a place I was treated badly at, I'm going to immediately say something like, \"I don't like that place, how about...\".  I visited Red Robin at around 4:30 this Saturday. It was busier than I would have expected at that time of day, but even so, it was maybe a fourth full, if that. The hostess confirmed that it was a table of one, then led me into the bar area without even asking if that was okay and tried to sit me at a small table. There were several open booths, but she acted surprised when I asked to sit at a booth instead. I gestured towards an open booth away from the occupied booths; I brought in a book, and I planned on reading while I ate. But she ignored me and sat me at the booth closest to the door (still in the bar area) and next to a table with customers that were engaged in a happy conversation.  I felt like I was being given the shaft since I was a single customer, but I was really looking forward to having some salmon and fries. I'm not a big burger fan, and I don't think this particular location has very good hamburgers to begin with, but I eat here fairly frequently because friends of mine work in the area and Red Robin is convenient for them. About a month ago, I decided to order the salmon, and it was extremely good. Combined with the steak fries (which honestly rank up there with McDonald's for the best fries available), and I had found a dish I liked even when I wasn't with friends.  But I sat at that table in the bar like an unwelcome visitor - and make no mistake, that's EXACTLY what I felt like - and for five minutes, no one came to serve me or even acknowledge my existence.  I left, and yes, I was the guy who said something extremely ugly to the hostess as I exited. I'm not proud of that, but I'm also not going to apologize.  If someone comes to your restaurant and wants to pay you to eat your food, they should expect to be treated with at least the minimal amount of respect a human being would treat another human being. I don't often dine alone, but when I do (and I'm thinking specifically of Longhorn, since I've been there a couple of times recently) I'm treated like a valued customer, like places like Longhorn treat everyone.  This was an extremely unpleasant experience, and I didn't even order any food or beverages, let alone eat. Maybe you might want to train your hosts and servers to treat people as human, even if they're not going to bring in as much money as a family or group might?",

I ordered my food online. When I went to pick it up it was correct and they gave me some complimentary fries. I will say this though, they should get some kind of bag that fits the fry container cause she was walking outside with the fries all exposed.

I'm very doing the healthy thing so I'm very selective in my menu choices but I must say the wedge burger and the endless broccoli with garlic butter sauce was simply Devine!

    "text": "Came here on the last night of the month (7/31/2018) to redeem my free birthday burger. I've been here on lots of occasions and never had an Issue. But tonight was a bit of a different story. I walked in and requested to sit on the patio. The hostess asked the waitress that was working that area and she stated that she could not work the patio even though she only had one other customer in her section at that time. Mind you, she was working the bar, but working the patio would not have a inconvenienced her one bit.  Despite that, I decided to stay. Big mistake! I sat down and ordered my food and drinks all in one go. I asked her for her suggestion for the burger and she suggested the smoke and pepper burger. I added onion straws to the Burger and ordered the adult freckled lemonade.   While waiting for my food, I had time to finish my drink, run to the car and read two chapters in my book. When the food arrived it was lukewarm at best. The burger looked much more chintzy and the normal size and all the ingredients including the onion straws were also called. Worst of all, the fries were also cold. I even ordered a second order of the bottomless fries and they were also cold. Actually, colder than the first.  Most of this time, my waitress was actually missing in action. I only saw her when she came to bring my drink and bring my food and then the rest the time she was too busy trying to clean up the place to stop and make sure I was OK. Mind you, when I arrived it was nowhere close to closing time. I would say around 8 o'clock. I didn't leave until 930.   When I went to settle on my bill on their tablet system, I punched in my rewards number from my free burger and it wouldn't come off. I asked her about it and she said \"Oh if I had known It was a birthday burger, I wouldn't have suggested that one. The finest burgers do not count with the birthday burger promotion.\" She stood there for a moment just kind of looking at me and then she said she would go ask her manager to see what he could do. Because she felt like it was her fault for suggesting the burger in the first place.   Now mind you the menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I was there ( a few months ago) and obviously the birthday promotion has changed since last year. I distinctly remember ordering a brand new burger last year and the coupon having no limitations on that.   Also, bear in mind it is the last day the month (The promotion is  only good during your birthday month) so on 7/31/2018, there's no way that I can use it another time. She comes back in the most the manager could do was to give me 50% off my burger only. Mind you the value of the regular burger is about $10-$11 I only received about six dollars off. So they actually made money off of me. I was all around disappointed. The service, the food, the unwillingness to honor the coupon, it was all just too much bad service for one interaction.   I will not be back to this location.",

I never had a problem with the food here but had to do a special review for the one time I stepped out the box and did not regret it. I decided to venture outside of the bigger world and try their salmon burger. Everybody go try it now! It was delicious! Cooked perfectly and the sauce on it was the perfect compliment! Not dry, not u Dee cooked, just perfect! Also it was a huge piece of salmon, the same size as one of their bigger burgers. Can't wait to try it again. Of course the service and our drinks were also great as always. Red Robin always seems to come through!",

    "text": "Now that I'm a mom, I feel like this review needs a facelift!  I gave 4 stars before being a mom and sitting in the 21 and over section, but now that we are sitting in the back it is a different experience!  We have a two-year-old, and I will say that all the servers have been awesome being sweet to him and giving him attention. The hostesses are also super sweet and gave him attention bringing him a balloon.    My favorite food hasn't changed, I am still eating in the mushroom burger all of the time and I still love the fries and onion rings!! You cannot beat that smoky sauce that they give with onion rings. This is a splurge for me calorie wise, but sometimes it's just worth it!",

    "text": "We ordered a few dishes for takeout. The kids' mac-n-cheese was tiny -- probably about 1/4 of a cup portion. The other kids' meal was mini corn dogs, and both came with a side of broccoli. One of the broccoli servings was a lone piece of broccoli (I'm serious) and the other one was about a cupful. Even so, the broccoli was weirdly textured, like it had been dried out prior to cooking. A side of \"unlimited\" fries, even after requesting a generous portion, was about nine sad steak fries.  Sizes of orders were very small and inconsistent. We were disappointed with the lack of quality presented in our takeout order. It most definitely was not worth the price we paid.",

They gave me the wrong check. Had to go ask again for our right check told the manager it was the wrong check and that we didn't get our fries he said sorry and handed me the check. Way to goooo!! I would totally understand if they were busy but there was just us and one other table we didn't even get silverware:(",

As mentioned I ordered through Postmates, and included a few special requests to make my meal vegetarian-friendly (no bacon, no chili, BOCA patties, etc.), to which Postmates & Red Robin paid no attention. We got our meal and bacon. was. on. everything. The cheese fries were covered in chili and everything was missing ranch, salads included (how is that okay??).  I don't know if the staff just felt like doing their own thing or if they thought I was joking about the no meat thing, but I'm so disappointed, $50 down the drain.",

I said color please.   Let's get straight to the criticism. A thiiiiiin burger on a big bun that was essentially undercooked!   Even properly cooked would fail to make a difference. I will never willingly return. These problems can't possibly be fixed.",

    "text": "Improved wait staff and great manager.  I ordered a burger with 4 special requests (not so special).  Egg to be over easy, runny yolk is crucial; swiss instead of American; onion straws (get my food friends straws they didnt want so they came on the side; medium (some pink in the patty);  The burger hit 3 out of 4 perfectly.  The burger was all brown through and through.  The manager vowed to personally remake the burger and I was brought fresh fries to tide me over during the short wait.  The burger came back perfect.  This was great service.  The waitress was great too, she got all my order just right.  We left a large thank you tip.  The burger was also taken off the bill, that waa a great gesture and won ky repeat business.  Camp sauce, I like it.  It has none of the heat of the Bad Daddy ketchup but the flavor is great.  I prefer the heat but not everyone does.  The burgers here are better than Ruby Tuesdays and most other similar places.  What really pleases me are the unlimited sides. You wanna strap on the feedback and go nuts?  You can eat fries, sweet potatoes, or brocoli.  I feel healthy after having four servings of the broc.  You can take a lot if liberty with how you order your burger.  Change the cheese, add onion straws, add mushrooms, whatever.  You can't sneak in free eggs or bacon but lots of toppings.  They added new touch pads to order stuff and call over a server.  The summon doesn't always work as inrended. It beats my owl eyes, where I stare st the waiter until they come over.  I like it here more and more and the birthday burger doesn't hurt.  Child portions are very large.  Dare I say a good value.",

    "text": "Online order # 198240020. Normally my experience here isn't so bad but today was. I ordered for the first time the caesar chicken wrap and I had more wrap than chicken. I will NOT ORDER THAT AGAIN!  Also, the side caesar salad only had lettuce, no croutons no cheese. I asked the server if he noticed the same thing and he said yes. He took my salad back to the back and when he came back to the front. He said I had them put some cheese on the salad but were out of croutons. Are you serious???? A caesar salad without croutons is like eating a salad with only lettuce. Needless to say, he never offered me anything different since this restaurant was out of croutons.  Which was very disappointing. Update...  Went today to see if this location could get it right and of course NOPE they couldn't.  Guest services sent me a reward for my horrible experience yesterday. So, I went back today to use the reward. Big mistake at this location.. I even took pictures. I went today to get the wedge burger.  I believe it's just time for me to give this red robin location a break. For some reason, I'm having bad experiences here for the past 2 days. Did they really expect me to eat the hard part of the lettuce and I asked for all ingredients on the side because I DID NOT want my lettuce wet after I heat up my meat and cheese up.  Burger burnt anyways. Thank you for the reward. But, this is ridiculous!  I do not EXPECT another reward but I do want guest services to be aware of there locations and what's going on. Please have a talk with your kitchen staff ASAP because clearly they do not care!",
