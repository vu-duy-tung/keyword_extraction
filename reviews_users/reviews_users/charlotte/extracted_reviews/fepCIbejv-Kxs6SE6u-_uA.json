The portions are huge, which is a good thing considering how pricey they are.  The filet mignon single cut is tasty, the chopped salad delightful & the sauteed spinach & mushrooms are to die for! Oh & of course dessert, the very refreshing mixed berries.  The wait staff are very attentive & the one night I went, our waitress went a little overboard.  The ambiance is nice & intimate & I love that it's two story.",

The restaurant was busy but not packed, there were still a few open tables. Our reservation was at 8:30pm, we didn't get our order taken until 9:20pm. When the food came, two of our orders were wrong but it wasn't that big of a deal to send it back. Thankfully they had a designated waiter to refill water because we would have been thirsty throughout our dinner. The waitress did not come back over until the end of our meal. The food was ok but not worth the price. The service will definitely ensure that i will not return.  Uptown Charlotte NC location.",

    "text": "So I went to Morton's on a \"date night\" with my mom after a coworker gave her a gift certificate.  She had been there before and told me to prepare myself for probably the best meal I will ever eat.  And as much as I hate to admit this .....  ......she was right.  Like other reviewers had stated, valet parking is a must unless you know of a perfect hidden gem of a parking lot.  The food.  Oh the food.  I was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut.  To be honest, I can't tell you what it was, but it was beautiful and perfectly cooked.  We ordered two sides to split.  The server told us that both of these are on their new menu which hadn't been printed yet by the time we were there.  One was a scalloped potato that was phenomenal.  But my favorite of the two sides was the creamed corn with tasso ham.  I was so enamored with it, I jotted down what was in it so I could try to replicate it at home!  Haven't tried to yet, and I'm sure my culinary prowess will get me CLOSE, but I would rather get it from Morton's.  For dessert I HAD to go with the molten lava cake which is apparently their best dessert and for just cause.  It was incredible!  If only I weren't so full on my sensational steak and sides (pardon the alliteration!), I could have finished it all.    All in all, I WILL go back to Morton's, and I really really hope they have the creamed corn again!",

I have dined at a number of Morton's and this was by far the worst. To make matters worse the manager (grey suit) actually had an average ticket discussion with our waitress right next to our table. If this was Chili's I get it but not at a Morton's. Class was clearly missing from the environment. Again if you are just going for the food its a ok choice. If you are going for the food and experience I would suggest The Palm or Ruth's Chris.",

I have to say that having seen Michael Jordan at Del Frisco and Yao Ming at Morton's... the other value is seeing famous people in Charlotte.   If you want the ultimate steak..  and have the money to spend.. go for it, but if you are just looking for a nice place to take someone special this one compares to it's slightly less expensive brothers...",

The food was average & almost disappointing, and most definitely not worth the prices. The bread was dry, and almost over cooked with burnt onion seasoning on top. The steak was good & correctly prepared, but not amazing as you would expect from the expensive price. My average martini was $16...what on earth? To sum it up, too expensive for just average food & drink.",

The only part of the restaurant I didn't like was the lighting, it felt to bright/florescent. They offered a variety of light appetizers, such as crab cake sandwich's/shredded beef sandwich's (the bread used for these was way too thick and took away from the meat in the sandwich), tuna tartars, cheesecake, bruschetta (perfectly seasoned), ex.

Before the steaks arrived they served fresh butter and a hot boule of bread that you could smell baking because of the scent of the toasted onion on top. We also shared the Morton's salad which is greens mixed with blue cheese dressing topped with egg and anchovies. All the portions are ginormous and so easily shared!  My husband ordered the molten hot lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce which was made to order and ordered when we ordered the steaks. It was divinely chocalatey! He also ordered a tawny port to end the meal. I had tastes and sips of both and they were delicious, and was too full to have my own!  We enjoyed sitting together in the circular booth and talking and sharing a superb meal   made all the more pleasant with a wonderful waiter and maitre d'.",

So we went to dinner around 8 no reservation ; however I wouldn't suggest this on the weekend . Process was easy , we were quickly seated . We had an amazing server name Christian ( I think that was his name , wears glasses  ) Christian got us started with some yummy apps ! I always seem to get the Shrimp Alexander . My girlfriend got the Lobster Bisque before dinner . To my tasting the bisque was standard nothing too amazing .My girlfriend on the other hand had a hard time enjoying it and sent it back. I was a tad bit disturbed ( I hate sending food back ) but Christian just made us feel so comfortable about it . Dinner was amazing . I believe I had a mixed grill plate ehh , I believe cost was around $55. Salmon , 2 stuffed shrimp and 2 grill shrimp . The girlfriend had surf and turf . Meat came out perfect ! I basically swallowed my entire plate down in 0.3 seconds .  The Manager came over to introduce himself and to let us know of some water issue that was causing the restaurant to close down and 9:30. It really didn't seem like and issue being that I did swallow all my food down rather fast  . He apologized numerously and even compd our appetizers and dessert ! I was sold alone on his personality and concern for everyone in the restaurant having a wonderful experience . With the water line messing up we understood it was not the restaurants fault but it was nice to see the manager cared. Upon leaving , I gather my things to get the card for my valet and notice my car was already pulled up!!! The manager walked us out and had already timed the car to be brought up perfectly !!!! Whoa!!!! I am usually a Del Frisco girl but I really think Morton's stole me away !   I am already re thinking birthday dinners and other celebrations for Morton's instead of Del Frisco !",

The cocktail and wine list are great and the cocktails are on the side of a heavy pour. This delicious huge round mound of onion bread with butter is served to all tables just be sure not to fill up on bread! The tuna sashimi I appetizer is my favorite and I have ordered scallops as well as steak here and entrees are delicious. I tried the coco late cake for dessert and it was rich and creamy, but very large so I suggest sharing or taking it to go for a later time. It is pricey, but a great place for a date. The interior is beautiful and classy. They have a few table top area to eat at the bar as well as bar stools if that is more your thing.",

    "text": "3 friends and I went to Morton's for the National Filet Mignon Day where they serve $1 Petite Filet Mignon Sandwiches in the bar area. We waited for about 40 minutes for a table, and when we were finally \"seated\", we had to stand at a high top table because they had run out of chairs. The waiter was obviously busy and when he came over to get our drink order, we went ahead and gave him a standard order of 20 sandwiches for the table. He brought us our drinks and then left us to converse. Then we waited for our food.  20 minutes  40 minutes  AN HOUR.  We started noticing that other patrons were receiving their food when they had sat down well after us. One of the guys at our table tracked down the manager because... oh yeah... we hadn't seen our server since we sat down. If anything we wanted another round of beers.  Then the manager came over and gave us some less than thrilling news. The waiter NEVER PUT OUR ORDER IN. He simply forgot, and we had to listen to the manager ramble on incessantly about how crowded and busy they were and this should somehow make us understand.   Side note: had the waiter written the order down, he wouldn't have forgotten! This is doubly important when the manager was falling over himself in a hungover stupor, pleading with us to see from their perspective that it's all okay because of how busy they were.   Our food was rushed out and when we called for our checks, we expected the sandwiches to be taken off the bill (I mean it was $20 for 4 grown men) and he only took off 50%. That saved us each a whopping $2.50. Gee thanks grandma!  Then the cherry on top was that the server (or was the manager handling our table now?) didn't come collect our credit cards, so we had to walk the bill up to the bar so we could get out of that godforsaken place.  Final note: This was the first occasion I have ever left zero tip for service at a restaurant, but it simply was that bad. I will never go back, and we are telling all of our friends about our horrible experience.  Hey Morton's! 1) Write down orders so you don't forget. 2) Don't complain to the customers about how busy your restaurant is when you are providing a deal that is going to fill your bar area to capacity! WE DON'T CARE! It's your job to provide the service.  I wish I could leave a no star rating.",

I ordered my first $47.00 fillet mignon and I was eager to see if it really was that much better than what you would get at Outback Steakhouse.  It was  better but not proportionately better than what you would pay at Outback.  We had a 9:00PM reservation and they told us to wait in the bar and they would come and get us when the table was ready.  We waited about 15 minuets and saw tables empty and then we went and asked if our table ready.  So I think they forgot about us.  We ordered the chopped salad for $10.00 and it was nothing special, my wife ordered the salmon which was not as good as I could cook on the grill at home.  The New York Cheesecake for desert was no better than anything I would buy in a grocery store.  I guess if I am going to drop $150.00 for dinner I expect outstanding food and service.  Neither of which I think we received.  Next time I want a good steak I think we will save about $80.00 and go to Outback and probably leave more satisfied.",

The dining experience is not only the food but ambience and service.  The service was way too quick and felt like in a drive-thru instead of a relaxing evening out with friends and sensed wanted us out there as soon as possible.  As all the courses are ordered in the beginning absolutely no time in between to savor the course as the plates were whipped away as soon as we had eaten and the next course placed in front of us.  We were not even asked if we would like coffee so decided to leave without ordering any. We had an early reservation and most of the tables on the upper level where we were seated were empty.  As diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good. When one of the managers came over discreetly mentioned the service and called today as well.  An apology was given with a please come back to the restaurant as this is not usually how Morton's does business.  No offer of enticement though.  Food for the most part was good although one of the filets was stringy and inedible but that can happen sometimes.  We all left disappointed and especially the couple that raved about it and asked us to join them.",

    "text": "Worst steakhouse experience I have had to date! I  aware that my boyfriend and I went to enjoy Mortons for the first time during Queens Feast aka Restaurant Week which some may say that is why our experience was so poor. I believe this week is a way to win new patrons and to showcase what your restaurant does well. It may be a discounted price for Mortons but we are still spending our hard earned money.   Our evening started out well, promptly greet by the host, who quickly found our reservation. We were slightly early so they requested that we wait for a few minutes in the bar. We may have waited 5 minutes before our table was ready.   The decor is awful and the lighting feels like you are under fluorescent. I felt like I had walked into a mans bachelor pad with the black and silver ultra mod vibe. We were seated and given water from back waiters quickly. We discussed the menu, which we had already reviewed online before we picked which restaurant we wanted to try, therefore we knew what we wanted.   We made a decision on a bottle of wine we wanted which we ordered from the manager. At this point we still had not seen our server. Once the server finally made his way to our table he was very pushy about trying to get us not to eat off the restaurant week menu. It was obvious he was disappointed that we were there to partake in RW.   We finally made the server understand that we weren't going to do anything over than RW and wine. I ordered the tuna tartare as my starter which took a very long time to reach our table but was delicious. My second course was the Filet (Med Rare) prepared Oscar style with Bearnaise sauce on the side. We waited and waited... Then waited some more.   There was a large private event which I am assuming took preciseness over us. Even with that being said our server just disappeared!!! I poured my own wine refills. We were sitting there wondering what was taking so long for our steaks and he didn't come by to offer an update. When the steak came out I cut into mine and it was Well Done!!!! My boyfriends steak was also over cooked, he ordered Rare and received MedWell! They took our steaks and then we waited again... Mine comes out covered in Bearnaise sauce!!! I requested sauce on the side because I don't like sauce on my steak, only on the asparagus. Eventually they bring my steal out correct.   We ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were. Very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience. Our table was cleared and the server brings out the dessert which AGAIN was wrong! He rolled his eyes at us when I told him, this isn't our fault that he is getting our order wrong!   Even at the discounted price we paid for Queens Feast we felt robbed. Our server still made good money from us, we never tip poorly but we felt he didn't deserve it. The experience was absolutely horrible and my boyfriend and I vowed to never visit again.   I received an email, from the automated system, asking how our experience was so I wrote the manager telling him about our experience and he never even bothered answering me.   If you want to enjoy a nice steak dinner take your money to Capital Grille or Flemings!",

Traffic caused us to not make our reservation so we called ahead and notified them, host was very pleasant and understanding.  They offered us a reservation 15 minutes later which allowed time for us to get through the traffic.  Great attention to detail by the staff and terrific ambience in the restaurant.  Our server, Cody was absolutely terrific.  He made sure everything about our anniversary dinner went great for us.  They provide a special menu for anniversaries and birthdays, which was just phenomenal.  We had the prime bone-in ribeye and the prime Cajun ribeye.  Steaks were cooked to perfection, exactly the temperature we asked for.  Definitely recommend the legendary hot chocolate cake for dessert.  Cody also obliged to take photos of us to commemorate our anniversary celebration, they then took a picture and printed it out for us with a nice background for a cute keepsake for us to hang on to.  They really did go the extra mile and that meant a lot to us.  Thanks Morton's and Thanks Cody for a wonderful night!",

Ir was my wife's and i anniversary and we sat in the bar area this past Saturday night, which we always do when we go out. We sat down and the male waiter took 10 minutes to take our order, he was preoccupied/talking with the table next to us who we could tell were regulars. Ordered our drinks and the shrimp app at the same time. It took the shrimp app 34 minutes to arrive, the waiter was very apologetic he said \"he thought the apps were coming out of the front of the kitchen and they were actually coming out of the back part of the kitchen\". The shrimp app was very good we bothed enjoyed it. We then ordered a bottle of wine which took 17 minutes to get, i actually had to ask the bartender where it was, cause our waiter was again talking to the regulars. So we went ahead and ordered the 2nd course my wife ordered the chopped salad and I ordered the lobster bisque. Again, it took forever to get the 2nd course, the salad was very very good my lobster bisque had 3 small pieces of lobster, it was luke warm and no taste. The used waaaay to much heavy cream.  I sent it back and ordered the salad. After all of this we gave up and left. While we were there though another regular came in and sat at the bar and ordered a drink and an app, after some time he stood up and said \"this is ridiculous, its taking waaaay to long to get my oysters\" and he just left. Another table besides us had an issue and left also, although I think they were just veryyyyy needy, cheap and way out of place. Now they did give us a $20 discount which was nice but my 1 drink cost that much. I could tell it was an off night for everyone it seemed, but being our first time to a Mortons we were very disappointed. There is a Ruth Chris and Del Friscos right by where we live that we frequent often and we were hoping to add another selection to our steakhouse restaurants.",

    "text": "My family and I had our Christmas Eve dinner here (2016), and it was by far the worst dining experience of our lives.   Our experience started off great, our hors d'oeuvres and wine were excellent. But once it came down to our main course it went south pretty rapidly.   When you dine at upscale places you're used to a specific presentation and representation of the restaurant. None of our meals came at the same time, my mothers fillet was over cooked( asked for medium rare and received well done- anyone who eats a good cut knows anything more than medium rare just destroys the meat) my brother had ordered the bone-in. I've never seen that specific cut of meat served as thin as it's was, and his was over cooked and brought out ice cold.   As for my father and I, we have a tradition of going to the palm and splitting a lobster. We were told we had a female 6lb on reserve. The lobster was brought out last, un-cracked, no utensils, no lemons, didn't put the bibs on us. When we were insulted with the presentation and asked them to please crack the shells for us, We received attitude and the whole lobster was taken away and brought into the kitchen. Anyone who's had lobsters knows that the lobster is ALWAYS presented and then cracked table side. When the lobster was brought back out we were missing 90% of the meat. And that's not an exaggeration. The plate they put the meat on was a large bread plate. Whatever meat they platted was destroyed and slapped on a plate. When we asked where the rest of the meat was, we again were replied with attitude..- this is all the meat- a 6lb lobsters meat wouldn't fit on a small bread plate let's be serious. Also when we were told the lobster was female I pointed out the rue was green not red, which would indicate the lobster was a male. I was told I was mistaken, which I was not.  The manager was asked to come to our table to go over the disaster of our Christmas Eve meal. We see our dad one time a year and this is what we look forward to all year. The manager was the RUDEST man I've ever encountered and he tried to embarrass my father. We've eaten at Morton's all over the country and it's safe to say this was an embarrassment of the establishment and the management team should be ashamed.  Thank you for ruining our Christmas Eve dinner . Definitely one we will never forget. We will make sure to stay at The Palm.",

    "text": "Parent's came for a surprise visit and my dad had wanted to go to a premium steakhouse for a while.   Let's start with the positives: Caesar salad was nice in taste but the portion was small. We got 2 salads to share for 4 people. Tasted nice, just felt small. Wife got the seabass which was amazing. Super flaky and prepared nicely in a lemon sauce Parm + truffle fries ... yummy in my tummy :) Excellent service. Constantly going above and beyond  Negatives I've come to the conclusion that Charlotte loves their sea salt. My father's and I 12 Oz filet were filled with salt.  Steaks arrived cold. Last morton experience at a different location had the steaks sizzling  Fries that we got were cold. Based on this and our steaks they are not timing their food preparation properly.",

    "text": "I dragged my friend out to Morton's for their bar menu last Friday. I often miss out on happy hour deals due to my work schedule, so I was eager to check this happy hour out on my weekday off. To my surprise, Morton's offer their bar menu and drink specials from Open to Close Sunday to Friday!  They had a list of bar bites available for $8. We selected the Filet Trio & Crab Cake BLT sliders. We also each had a cocktail for $8.50 each - all & all make this a good bargain at one of the top restaurants in town.  Now - the reason for my 3-stars... I understand we were not spending big bucks, but the fact that we requested medium rare on the filet, it came out more like well done and the bartender simply said it was impossible to cook a small filet piece medium rare bothered me. I realize that the bar bite dish consisted of 3 small pieces of filet - but if it is a challenge to cook medium rare on that particular dish they should have said so when I made the request. I have issues with steakhouse not coming close to the temperature I requested, worse when they didn't even bother to pretend they cared. Good thing it was $8.  Overall the food was ok - the filet trio came with 3 different sauces and the blue cheese butter was the clear winner. The crab cake BLT was good as well. It is a good spot for a cheap bite at the bar.",

Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment \"Oh jeans I see...\" making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience.   The drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.  Unfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.  When people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience.",

    "text": "A very good steakhouse experience that comes at the steepest prices I've ever paid.  $250 for two after tip and I could have easily spent $100 more considering we each had one drink and not a bottle of wine.  It's hard for me to even sound like I'm complaining because these was among the best steaks I'ver ever tasted.  I got the Cajun Ribeye ($56), 16 ounce cut, that was truly the tastiest cut of Prime meat I can remember and of course it was cooked to perfection.  My girlfriend got the 12 ounce Filet Mignon ($55) and this was very thick and cooked to perfection as well.  Both steaks were great and seasoned well.  We started with a couple of drinks, which I had the Pineapple fall cocktail which was a a nice mix of cognac and grand marnier ($16).  This was a solid cocktail to enjoy with the meal overall.  For my starter I had the Five Onion Soup ($12) which was small for the price but great tasting nevertheless.  For the side we shared a huge portion of Potatoes Au Gratin ($13), which were good but nothing earth shattering as I would have probably just preferred a loaded baked potato.  To finish the meal off we shared a dish of Creme Brulee ($13), which I thought was wonderful and definitely worth sticking around for, especially since your bill is already approaching $200.  Food:  9.5/10  Obviously only the best ingredients here. Service:  10/10  Impeccable service and speed. Ambiance:  7/10  nothing unique or special; corporate feel the whole way Value:  6/10  If money is no object... fine.  But not a lot of value for your $ Overall: 7/10  for the money and ambiance, I have other spots.  Unfortunately won't be returning much due to price.  I just like other spots more that feature more creative dishes in a non boiler plate atmosphere.  That being said, you will have a great steak here.",

    "text": "I'm the girl who goes to a steakhouse and orders salmon. Go ahead, throw rocks at me.   Okay, so not every time. I love a good steak, but for some reason the chili glazed goodness was calling my name last week. A group of six friends came here to celebrate a birthday. Before I get to the food, I have to talk about the special touches they did for the birthday. They made us personalized menus that said Happy Birthday Jason at the top. Our server also took a group pic of the table and made a special card with it. Great stuff.   And now to the feast. We ordered for the table jumbo shrimp Alexander and from the specials menu: crab stuffed mushrooms and bacon steak. How could we not order something called bacon steak?! Spoiler alert: worth every calorie. We also got some lobster bisque and wedge salads. The wedge was massive. The clear steak winner for the table was the Chicago Style Prime Bone-In Ribeye. I wanted it, but knew there was no way possible I could finish it. Andrea and Jason split one. Great idea and I highly recommend. Back to my salmon, I thought it was delicious. The succotash type goodness under it was also really good. We ordered a bunch of sides to split. My winner was the horseradish mashed potatoes. Warning: they pack a punch. I also got a boozy coffee drink for my post-dinner dessert. It was good, but I was way too full by that point to completely enjoy it.   Our server was fantastic. She took a lot of time to explain the menu and go over options. She was also really honest with her answers, which I completely appreciate. She didn't BS or lie. The manager also came over to check in on us and see how the evening was going.  Now Morton's is not something that works with my budget as a frequent stop, but it is a nice option as a special occasion place. The bar is also a great place to hang out for a drink or a bite. My friend Kevin swears by the burger.",

Let's start with the ambiance which is that of an modern urban steak house. Close tables, noisy and very chic! We were seated upstairs which allowed for ease of conversation although the servers work their tails off running up and down. More about the service later.  We ordered from the QF menu. We ordered Caesar salads which appeared to be a single salad portion served on two plates. Pretty much dry and tasteless. Extra dressing was served, upon request but a poor imitation of a classic.  Our steaks were perfectly prepared albeit the smallest 8 ounce steak I've ever eaten. The lyonnaise potatoes served my Bride were soft, crisp less and scant. My asparagus was cooked properly but also short on quantity. Our Creme-brulee was good.  Our server, Tara did an outstanding job from start to finish. Her efforts, personality and enthusiasm made this the star rating a 3. Considering the regular prices, I wouldn't say the food we were served deserve their price points but we did enjoy our dining experience which was enhanced by Tara!",

I got the onion soup (good, but unusual), steak (no flavor, had to send it back initially for being medium well vs. medium rare) and for dessert I got creme brulee (ice cold). The worst part was the service....I felt as if food was being thrown in front of me...literally (so did others at our table).  Never was a plate placed in front of me or straight.....with each course I had to pull the plate in front of me!  I expect more at a restaurant that charges these prices. Now granted, I was there on a Saturday night with a group of 10, but there were many empty tables around us....now I know why.

    "text": "Went here for our second time last night (New Years Eve) and had an even better experience the second time around.  Our server, Tara, really made the dining experience great for us.  She checked in with us before we had to look for her, but not so much as to be an annoyance, and she made wonderful suggestions as to drink choices, the seasonal pineapple drink, I forget the name, was amazing and at her recommendation.  I also mentioned that the steak I had last time was a bit too well done and she made sure the cook made it medium as I requested and it was perfect when it came back.  One of the best steaks I've had.  All in all, this was a wonderful New Years experience and we will definitely be coming back some time in the new year!",

So we are not frequent customers, but we are occasional customers.  So I called and made a reservation for our anniversary. When we showed up, Bill had our table set up with a beautiful bouquet of flowers for my wife and personalized menus wishing both my wife and I happy anniversary!  Again, we are loyal customers, but not as frequent as I would like.  The level of caring was second to none. During our meal, the hostess came over and took our picture. After we finished, she returned with jacketed prints also wishing us a happy anniversary.  The food was wonderful, as always!  That is the reason we return.  If you are looking for a magical evening to spend a special occasion, defiantly consider doing what we do and going to see Bill!  Make sure to call ahead and make a reservation. They can be busy!",

Compared to my not-so-impressive experience at many of DC area LSC steakhouse restaurants, this place was completely the opposite. Their bartender, Bill, made one of the best manhattans I have had which really made my meal that much more satisfying. Their power hour menu also had rather reasonably priced items and everything I had was delicious - I loved seaweed salad in their tuna tartare appetizer, and their parmesan truffle fries and cheeseburger sliders were quite delicious. The top buns of cheeseburger sliders came out too burnt making it difficult to chew them - their GM apologized for it and took if off of my menu, which I thought was a nice gesture. I would be remiss if I did not mention the amazing ambiance of both their bar area and dining room. Well worth the visit and I will be returning again for sure.",

    "text": "Holy cow my review for this place is laaaaatttteeee. I went during restaurant week this past time (yeah I know it's been a month at least) but hey it was that fantastic that I remember every juicy detailed bite to tell you all about it! So my guy and I were really looking for some redemption after our not so fantastic experience at capital grille so my guy suggested here to give it a shot.   So in my opinion the most amazing steaks I've had have been at places that realize that when something is already good don't try to over think it don't add 17 different seasonings and toppings until you can't tell your eating a steak anymore! I want my steak to taste like steak! And lemme tell ya Mortons got it right! My filet melted in my mouth it was savory with just the right amount of light seasoning like salt and pepper and cooked to perfection! The sides of mashed potatoes were creamy and light with just what tasted like a little butter and salt/pepper.  I don't know maybe they have some magic working back there because it was delicious without a ton of stuff added to them. Perfect.   They also provide you with the biggest loaf of bread I've ever been served at any restaurant ever with onion wine jam to spread on it. It was addictive! I mean did they not have want me to have room left? Seemed like it I couldn't stop eating it and there seemed to be an endless supply!  The staff were also great attentive even given the crazy restaurant week crowd we never wanted for a thing and we sat at the bar. They also have complimentary valet outside but there's always parking on the street too! This place is a must!",

We should not have to sit here and stare at the kitchen waiting for our food to come out. At this very moment we are still waiting on our food. Not worth the money if we can't get any food!!",

    "text": "I understand that large parties take longer to serve but 3+ hours to dine is completely ridiculous. I watched our waitress serve, grab checks, refill drinks, and bring back checks before they came back to fill my glass of melted ice. We actually had to go to the bar to order drinks because both of our waitresses were missing. It took about an hour for them to clear our empty appetizer dishes out of our way. I ordered the porterhouse medium and it came out well done with the edges crispy. This was two hours into the meal so I decided to leave it alone. When my friend mentioned my steak, the waitress immediately fixed the issue. All i could see was nasty looks from the cooks after this issue. I saw them pointing over to our table and had the most disgusted looks on their faces. The whole experience was unpleasant.   My friend wanted to save the candles from her birthday cake and she asked our waitress if she could bring a napkin to the table for us. She told us that they don't bring bar napkins to the table but she will this time. Like seriously. We collectively spent over 1000 at the table and you can't bring us a disposable napkin without a snide remark? There were also multiple times where the waitress gave other rude remarks about their food as if we are oblivious to how a steakhouse works. Mind you, there were 2 chefs at our table. The attitudes of everyone in there wasn't worth the meal or the experience.   The oysters were good. The porterhouse was great after they finally cooked it right. I'll never go back though.",

The tuna tacos stood out! Our drinks were fine. I ordered a margarita which was ok, my wife order a gin Martini, which was crazy strong. We also had a couple of classes of wine and a beer. All came out to around $68. Not too bad for what we had and were we had it.  All and all, a lovely experience and I can definitely see us returning",

Got our waters and menu within minutes.  Put in our orders before 9:11.  Drinks came before 9:23p.  Not too bad, three glasses of wine.  The food plates came out at that time, too, including the cute gravy boat full of ketchup.  We were told the food would be right up.  So we didn't hold back on the drinking.  That was a mistake.  Food didn't arrive until 9:54.  Yes, I checked on that exact timing.  We couldn't get ahold of anyone to bring the check for nearly an hour.  It was 10:56 before our credit cards were brought back to us.  One person did apologize, when the bill was brought over, saying, \"Sorry about the wait, the bar got a little behind.\"    TLDR: 1 hour wait for food, 1 hour wait for check.  Food is fine, although it bugs me to pay $8 for a small  (under 6oz) glass of wine when the bottle sells for the same price.",

Staff was courteous and friendly, decor was comfortable albeit lighting a bit dim, and the music was a little too elevator like.  For the food, I ordered the Cajun Ribeye and my guest ordered a Filet with shrimp and scallops. My Ribeye was outstanding.  They nailed it and I was so happy as so many steakhouses have disappointed I'd almost given up on them. We also ordered spinach with mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and a giant spud. The reason for the 4-stars and not 5 is that the potato was overcooked, the Brussels Sprouts were a bit too soggy and the music was...meh. $85 bottle of wine plus the aforementioned items was $250 + tip.  Overall though it was a good experience.",

Great service, attention to detail, absolutely delicious food (from the bread, all the way through to dessert).   To start the dinner, we were seated at a nice, comfy big booth. Our waitress greeted us with congratulations, on the milestone anniversary. Next she said that when ppl celebrate their anniversary at Morton's, they take pictures of the couple. Sure enough, camera ready, she took a few pictures of us and even framed it. The photo frame had a sweet message from the Morton's staff (brownie points!!).  They printed out a special menu, to celebrate our 5th anniversary, which included a complimentary dessert.  I went for the mixed grill, which included grilled salmon topped with a hefty serving of lump crab meat, shrimp alexander and grilled shrimp. It was DELICIOUS and a great amount of food.   My husband had the Chicago bone in ribeye and we ordered a lobster mac to share. I'm not huge on steak but when I tell you..his steak was like butter and cooked to a perfect medium. I would actually order this for myself. The lobster mac had huge chunks of lobster, very good.  When it came time for dessert, I wanted chocolate and he wanted bread pudding, dilemma lol. Morton's accommodated both of our desserts complimentary, instead of just one.  We left smiling, stuffed and anticipating our next return.  Morton's, thank you for such a memorable experience!! We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "So we went here for our anniversary dinner together.   The atmosphere is very modern and intimate which is nice with the only down side being the bar is open to the restaurant so the nice quiet setting would get upset with the occasional scream or cheer. It also features a partially open kitchen which is fun.   The service was excellent. Very friendly, attentive, and upon making the reservation I noted it was for our anniversary and little steps were taken to make it special from an anniversary message on the menu, a picture at the table, and a complimentary dessert. Really helped make the dinner special.   The cocktails were unique and very well made.   Dinner was separate pieces instead of courses.   App: was bruscetta wrapped mozzarella with balsamic glaze.  - very well made and tasty.   Dinner: 1 porterhouse steak and 1 prime ribeye steak with lyonaisse potatoes and brussel sprouts(which were recommended by the waitress):  The steaks were good quality and you could taste that. Ordered them medium and got them nearly well.   They also were poorly seasoned...I realized that was going to be the case when I noticed salt and pepper on the table... also other tables had A1 being brought to them. Which is normally fine but not when you're charging $50+ per steak. They were also a little too charred.   Again they were very good and enjoyable but not what I'd expect from my $60 plate.   The potatoes were just well baked potato wedges with onion. Again no seasoning and almost asked for ketchup which I shouldn't have to do in an al a cart restaurant. Tasty but basic.   The brussel sprouts were steamed with some butter and weren't finished cooking. We didn't eat more than a few bites. But to their credit, when they saw we didn't like them they just removed them from our bill without a word from us.   Dessert was cheesecake and key lime pie. Being native New Yorkers we like a good cheesecake.  The cheesecake was decent the caramelized sugar coating is nice but was too thick.   The key lime pie was also good.  The final thing noticed was the restaurant was very empty.. in a prime location in uptown on a Friday night.   Mortons your service is impeccable and your staff should be commended. The waitress was wonderful, hostess welcoming, other servers had no problem stepping in for anything with a smile, and your well dressed managers made a point to regularly check up on us. Plus all those little details for our anniversary made our night special.   Your restaurant is beautiful and modern(maybe a wall between the bar and dining area) enjoyable to sit in.   Your cocktails are very tasty and unique.   Your food, let's be honest is overpriced for what you get. Your food desperately needs flavoring. For an al a carte restaurant your food is very plain. Salt, pepper, and supermarket steak sauce should not be required. Not even a personal blend of sauce but bottled A1.  Your drinks have a personal touch but your food and sides do not. I suggest redoing your food prep or lowering your prices some and you'll fill your dining room.",

    "text": "We came here for my birthday dinner. Would've given 5 stars if it was based all on service  First: the service was impeccable!  From the time we walked in we were greeted warmly.  When we were seated we were presented with a \"Birthday Menu\" which is equivalent to their normal menu with happy birthday at the top (a very elevated touch).  Our server was Erica and she was FANTASTIC!!! She was very friendly, knew the menu well, and was very engaging.  I ordered the chicken Christopher and the rest of the party had steak.  The chicken Christopher came out, it's a breaded chicken breast with a rather insipid sauce underneath.  So unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the chicken.  All of the other of my party said that the Steaks were absolutely delicious and done perfectly.   We ordered the Brussels, horseradish mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, and Lobster Mac & cheese.  The horseradish potatoes were absolutely divine.  The other sides we found rather disappointing as well, the lobster mac had an unexpected pungent flavor (likely Swiss or Gouda? --not being a fan of either it wasn't pleasant), but there were no notable undertones of cheddar or lobster as you'd expect.  The potatoes au gratin were typical of a chain restaurant as you'd expect, nothing to write home about.  The Brussels were cooked with onions, both having strong flavors, I would've liked to have seen the Brussels roasted with an olive oil and garlic.  Lastly, the horseradish mashed potatoes, now these were delicious.  They were creamy, whipped as you'd expect. The texture was perfect, not too chunky and not too puree-like.  The flavor was rich and balanced with a slight hint of horseradish as a pleasant middle and actor flavor.   Finally, we had dessert.  We chose the souffle (lemon) which takes 30m to be made fresh to order.  It came out looking delicious, with the side of a lemon sauce. I had never had a souffle for a dessert, so I was excited to try.  It turned out picture perfect and tasted the same. (If you don't like eggs, don't opt for this as it is made from egg and tastes like it as well).  We also chose the  Creme brulee which was delicious.  Served with raspberry's on top of the [traditional] perfectly caramelized crust.  So although I personally wasn't impressed by the food (I didn't get what the restaurant was known for --steak) I was impressed by the service.   tl;dr The service was well orchestrated from the arrival to the departure.  The staff was elevated and friendly throughout the evening.  We found the food (other than the steaks) to be lacking a flavor profile and in need of revamping.",

We were celebrating my dad's birthday and are still talking about how great it was to reunite at Morton's this year. Bill, our server, was incredible! So friendly, competent and a lot of fun. The food was amazing and fresh, delivered to the table as soon as it was prepared (ie, piping hot and perfectly prepped!). We ordered a LOT, but the most memorable dishes were the wagyu filet (Oscar style), wild mushrooms, wedge salad, and ribeye. Not to mention the wine... try the Napa wine made just for Morton's (Hands of Time?) and Papillon (surprisingly yummy). Enjoy!",

    "text": "The service started out great until it took a while to get drinks, appetizers, our meal then our check.    Their wine menu had a 2014 Stags Leap which they were promoting so we ordered a bottle but ended up getting the 2015.  I didn't realize it was the wrong vintage until half way through the bottle but no big deal.    The tuna tower finally arrived and was a joke, don't waste your money.  Not sure if they changed chefs or not but it wasn't what we had before.  When the steaks finally arrived, the staff was auctioning off our steaks, it seemed as if the staff was unsure of which order belonged to which guests.  When we cut into the steaks, they were over cooked so they prepared 2 new steaks which came out the way we ordered them along with new sides.    Our checks took anywhere from 35-45 minutes to get after our table was cleared.  One of the couples in our party had to leave early and was in the process of telling our waitress what they had and she told them \"that's not gonna help\" and just walk away.  Because of her response, she messed up everyone's check hence the reason for the delay with our check.  This could've easily been avoided from the beginning by asking who was on which check but she never bothered to ask.  This is unexceptionable at an establishment that's charging these prices.    I've been in this business before and if my guests were spending THOUSANDS on a meal, my servers would ONLY focus on this table to make sure everything was correct.  I'm very disappointed with the service of an establishment of this caliber.    Needless to say, we WON'T be back.",

When I go back, I'll be asking for him by name: David Brown. We had some picky food orders that I wasn't sure the kitchen would accommodate, and he went above and beyond to see that we were satisfied. That makes for good service. He did a fantastic job gauging the tone of our dinner and pitched his service just right. It is that indefinable quality which makes for GREAT service.  And our waiter didn't seem to be an exception. The maitre d' was charming, and the other waiters and waitresses that we interacted with were as well. The food is pretty good, but it's the sum of the experience that will bring us back.",

No matter what city I am in Morton's is always the best place for Steak.  I have been to other places like the Palm (in Charlotte and NY) and I always feel rushed. Morton's makes dining out an experience and it is always fun. The menu presentation is always a  highlight.    I once had a Christmas party for my team in one of the rooms. We had a great time and the staff treated us very well.  Do not fall into the trap of ordering the dessert before you get dinner.   This is a rookie mistake.

This was the first steakhouse I went to and I will have to rank them in the following order:  1 - Morton's 2 - Del Frisco's  2 - Sullivans 3 - Ruth's Chris 4 - Capital Grille  Why is it number 1?  First off the steak.  Fillet Mignon was to die for, literally.  Ok not literally but it was by far the most flavorful steak I've ever had.  I love rare steaks and this was cooked absolutely perfect.  The sides were delish as well but the steak the steak THE STEAK is amazing!  I would say the service is better than the food, but it can't get better.  The service is top notch seriously, our waiter joked with us and managed to be completely professional at the same time.  The manager also talked with our group for a while as well.  Hell even the valet guys were cool.    Then after dinner and drinks they took a group picture and gave each of us a copy, for free!  In the steakhouses in Vegas I frequent they always charge $20 to $30 a copy, so that was icing on the cake to me.  The layout is pretty nice and classy.  Tables are spaced well apart and not cramped at all.  There is an upstairs that overlooks the downstairs dining room, nice for a party.  The bar is all dark wood and to me is straight from the 20's.  You don't find too many classy bars like this anymore.  This place is classy, well appointed, and comfortable.    You dont get the snobby feel that \"some\" of the nicer restaurants give off either.

I was sitting in the bar when a guy in dirty jeans and a t-shirt was so drunk at the bar he fell off his bar stool and I had to pick up the stools. I decided this situation was not going to get better so I left before ordering.  I walked out and phoned the manager and told him that I was upset that they served this guy until he was totally intoxicated and could not even walk out of there.  He apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone.  I walked up and he was still staggering around outside and I walked in.  Rich said he was sorry and I sat back at the bar and he wanted to buy me an appetizer and a drink and I said okay.  The bartender never came back to me to take my drink order.  I decided to leave and the manager was outside still trying to take care of the situation with the drunk with the police. He saw me leave and I shook his hand and said thanks anyway and I walk away and when all else fails HOOTERS makes a mean chicken wing but would of rather had my Filet and Broccoli  Oh Well",

    "text": "WOW. Considering I'm a vegetarian and this is a steakhouse, it was strange that I had lunch at Morton's yesterday. The only reason I went was b/c they were hosting a Women's Luncheon, and I wanted to attend that, but I didn't think they would have anything that I could actually eat or would like. It feels even stranger to say that they did and it was good!   Morton's exceeded my expectations by quite a lot.   First of all, Krista, their Sales & Mktng Manager, was incredibly accommodating. I emailed her ahead of time to see if they had a meatless option, and she was great about writing back quickly and gave me the alternative course, which was fully vegetarian, and even asked for confirmation if it would work. I said yes, and it did.   The fist plate they served was a delicious deviled egg salad (they made sure I wasn't vegan before bringing this out). It was HUGE and very good. The serving size was actually enough to split between four people! The deviled eggs were diced into mini cubes and really nicely evenly spread throughout the salad. I loved the dressing too, though I'm not sure exactly what it was. I think it was ranch.   The main course was another gigantic plate. It was filled with broccoli, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. To look at, it was not that special, but the sauce that was added to all the vegetables was mouthwatering and made a plate of vegetables taste amazing. I also was served a ginormous bowl of mashed potatoes (also yummilious!).   By the time dessert was ready, I was absolutely stuffed. I asked for my cheesecake to go and shared it with my parents when we had dinner. The portion was so large and it was soo rich that even though we split it three ways, it was still filling!   The staff was very professional and the place was nice. I'm surprised to say I wouldn't mind going back.",

    "text": "Yes, Morty's is a chain. Yes, I still love it dearly. Yes, I wish it were less expensive. It also reminds me of my time in the Windy City...so I'm probably a bit biased.  They do, however, have a great bar menu with $5-$6 bar bites all day, every day except Saturday. Those are indeed quite the deal!  What I love from Morton's:  The staff: The servers, hosts and bartenders are extremely well-educated around their menu and offerings. Plus they are really in tune to ensure you have a great experience.  The environment: Old school steak house. Dark, oiled wood. Not super duper loud. Modern speakeasy, so to speak!   Filet mignon: Durr. Delicious. Perfectly cooked. Always.  Any type of potato: Really, any kind. I have yet to find a tater that I don't love here.  Morton's coffee: A delicious, alcoholic concoction that is just damn delightful. It's $8 but they also put real whipped cream on top...it's like a lovely dessert in a cup.  Lava cake: The best chocolate lava cake in Charlotte. Sorry. It is. Large, chocolatey & gooey with a honking scoop of vanilla and a smattering of fresh raspberries. I can't even finish it.   I'm looking forward to pulling up to bar and hammering through some of their delicious and affordable bar bites...soon....very soon.",

    "text": "we planned a special Christmas Eve dinner here this year. We recently moved to Charlotte and have enjoyed Morton's in Chicago and NY.  This was a horrible dinner! It started good. Our waitress was wonderful! We reserved a 6lb lobster for my husband and daughter (tradition). Our meal took quite a long time to be prepared, when we received it my filet was cold, covered in spices and overcooked. My son's bone-in ribeye was small (typically thick and very large), cold and overcooked. Vegetables and baked potatoes were cold. The worst was the lobster. It looked wonderful, however it was not cracked (typically it is cracked to ease your enjoyment). When asked to have it cracked (again this is usually done tableside), they took it away and when they finally returned there was a small bread plate of meat. We asked where the rest of the lobster was.  When the manager finally came by he was rude and couldn't understand why we were upset. He upset our Christmas Eve dinner experience so much that my son and I decided not to even mention the steaks...Suffice it to say we will never return to this Morton's! Morton's is an expensive restaurant that has to live up to it's expectations for a delicious meal and positive experience.  They failed. The Palm does it right.",

My only issue is that I shouldn't expect to see people in jeans and sweatshirts in a restaurant where I'm dropping $200+ for dinner for two.
