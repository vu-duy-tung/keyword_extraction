The salad my wife ordered was a work of art! Prosciutto ham, fresh mozzarella, Kalamata olives, generous other cheese and meat rolls, greens and their signature creamy tomato basil dressing. My Chicken Parmigiana sandwich was amazing. Dessert was insane! Worth a trip! Our new favorite!",

You get a lot for your money-a soup or salad to start with some hot, homemade bread, a large portion of a meal, and a good atmosphere. My usual is Fried Calamari with extra lemon to squeeze on top, Pasta Fagioli soup to start with, and their homemade Chicken and Spinach Lasagna! This definitely fills me up but you need to save some room for dessert (Lemon Cello Cake!). I have tried a little bit of everything off their menu and haven't been disappointed!",

I prefer to order for pick up rather than eat in because it seems they always have far too many people working when there aren't any customers. Every time I go in the staff (comprised mostly of teen girls) are congregated socializing, which is highly unprofessional. I always feel like an outsider there. If you aren't a regular, expect a rather cool reception.  We've had a good experience there, but it was only one time out of many.",

    "text": "Well Angela's did a redo  great and wonderful. I say it was a major miss, a few weeks ago me and my daughter ate here after they reopened and supposedly got their selves together.  Well we were greeted after a few minutes, that's odd because no one was in the restaurant, the waitress attitude was a little better than the food.  She had a problem every time I asked for something which is crazy because that's her job and all.  Other customers decided to eat in as well, one of the \"NEW\" employees or family members however you slice it went and got donuts for every one so all of the waitresses gathered at a space behind the bar and chugged their mouths with donuts while customers willing to pay for the food and bad service stood at the door and waited patiently.  The new guy behind the counter rung the bell like 4 times before one of the new employees thought that it was a good idea to seat the customers.  Hardly any of the tables were set with the items that all tables are supposed to have. You know like salt, pepper, silver ware, things of that nature. The food, well the salad that came with the meal was the best part, I guess it's kind of hard to mess up a salad.  The bread was also the same, but the noodles well let's say they took being al dente to a whole new level, not good taste like rubber almost, the sauce couldn't even cover that taste.  Any who I promised to never go back, the owner isn't nice but ok.  So today my daughter wanted noodles and her dad thought it would be a good idea to give Angela's another try well the only difference is we didn't eat in the establishment we took it to go.  The salad good, the fettuccine well it was a group of noodles stuck together, as if they threw them in the pot and didn't stir them before they fused together by then it was too late, and of course they didn't redo them.  I didn't even feel like returning them, because like I mentioned before the owner isn't nice. Will not be returning.",

And, the prices are very high for what you get!  The sauce is definitely NOT an old family recipe - tastes like it came out of a can and it tastes like it too!! There are way too many GOOD Italian restaurants in Matthews, Mint Hill and Charlotte, so do yourself a favor and skip this place and go to someplace other than Angela's that gives you a great meal, includes a salad and is worth the money you pay.  Also, the service is slow and the servers act like they are doing YOU a favor by waiting on you.  One on my pet peeves is leaving dirty dishes on the table and these lazy servers don't hesitate to do this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Run to another restaurant - NOW!!!",

    "text": "If Angela's had a million dollar budget for marketing, it would not matter. Fact is, no dollar amount could ever purchase the raving word of mouth this place is supported by.  You can't put a dollar amount on a satisfied customer boasting about their favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte. Based on my own experience, I have run across many fans of Angela's,both in and out of the restaurant.   While dining, I have actually had neighboring tables recommend their new favorite dish I should try.  While waiting for takeout at the bar I've run across some regulars telling me \"everything on the menu is great\". YES ,  I AGREE !  And there are even times when Angela's name and good reputation was a common factor to perfect strangers on the street. In fact, I myself had tried out the place due to a recommendation nearly two years ago.   There are some nights when I go for dinner and they are packed.  Wait time is usually kept short , unless I have brought a group of people.  On the other hand there are times when you have your pick of a table which almost makes me sad.  It is hard to believe that a place like this would ever be without a line out the door.   The food is delicious, the restaurant itself has personality that sparkles due to the friendly service and the devotion that shines through from the owners themselves. The portions are ample and the price is perfect in today's struggling economy.  Their website coupons change up from time to time which makes for more of a deal.  Pizza is one of my favorite things and it is ny style super good but they have things on the menu that will give my favorite a run for it's money.  The Chicken Linda is like nothing else  (chalk board special) and the Zuppa di pesce is memorable.  If they don't prepare the sausage and meatballs in house, I've been fooled.  But maybe that's because of that incredible sauce they serve it in.  Talk about memorable  (I am of Italian heritage for what it is worth)  Half star deduction for the tiramisu which is not house made but still good and half star added back for their fresh cannolis.  Charlotte Observer wrote that this is a restaurant that is \"most passionately supported\".  After being a customer for nearly two years I fully understand that I might have contributed to that title with pleasure.",

    "text": "This place is great! especially for the location. Great restaurants are lacking close to this area (in Charlotte off Idlewild near Mint Hill), but Angela's really stands out. We used to live near the Arboretum in Charlotte and found no Italian restaurants as a go to restaurant for Italian take out suitable at all.   The sauces are amazingly good. Garlic knots delicious. Capellini alla Primarvera is Awesome!!! :) But so is everything else we have tried. If you ask a waiter for the favorite dishes they will give you a long list of beloved dishes to try out.   Friendly Staff, Angela's is definitely a family owned business not a corporate giant or fine dining experience, so in my opinion the other reviewers are out of line with the staff reviews. They certainly expect you to enjoy your meal with more of a European pace to your dining experience. The owners are present and friendly in appropriate ways.   The portions are huge and heat up well the next day. Not necessarily dieter friendly. Repeat: The Sauces at Angela's are AMAZING. I think they go through a lot of great olive oil back in the kitchen. The pasta is great too.   Lots of dishes have lots of vegetables which is a huge plus for me. PERFECT FOR TAKE-OUT. There is always a steady flow of people coming in and out for take-out. Great for Dining In. Nice little outside seating area. Decent Music for a restaurant setting.   If you have at least somewhat well behaved kids I would imagine Angela's to be family friendly. Great place to go with friends.",

    "text": "I went to Angela's last Saturday for lunch, with my partner and my \"might as well be in-laws\". I have lived within 5 minutes of Angela's for nearly 2 years now, and this was my first visit. I now know why...  We walked in, and the place was COMPLETELY deserted, at 1pm. (Their lunch service runs from 11am - 2:30, so we were pretty much smack-dab in the middle of that).  I didn't expect the place to be hopping, but also didn't expect the place to be completely devoid of customers. I didn't take it as a good sign. The lack of any other customers made for a very somber dining experience.  After perusing their large menu, I ordered the 'Rigatoni alla Vodka'. I make a kick-ass Penne Vodka, and wanted to compare notes on a similar dish. It was good, but not great. I will say that the pasta was cooked the way I like it, al dente, which was a plus. No mushy rigatoni here. The onions in the creamy red vodka sauce were red onions, which struck me as an odd choice. I love all onions, so I was fine with it, but still - weird. All in all, it was good, but I think I would try something else next time.   The other dishes ordered were a Chicken Alfredo special of the day, Pollo alla Piccata, and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina. They brought us two twee loaves of hot bread after we ordered, with (sub-par) olive oil and balsamic for dipping. Salads do not come with the entrees during lunch or dinner service.  All of our dishes were between $8.25 - $10.  Our server was nice enough, but just didn't seem to \"click\" with us. She acted as if it was a pain for her to refill my unsweetened iced tea (the rest of the table had sweet tea), which annoyed me.   We didn't sample the wine list, unfortunately (I still can't bring myself to order a drink when the in-laws don't), so  I can't comment on that aspect.   We did look at the dessert menu, only to close it in disgust. It was strange. It was a pre-fab frozen desserts you've never heard of wonderland. No Tiramisu? No Panna Cotta? No Gelato? Very disappointing for a restaurant trying to do \"authentic Italian\".  (Also the dessert menu was on cheapo, dirty white cardstock, with horribly dated looking photos, with \"Angela\" on the top. Seeing as how the restaurant is called \"Angela's\", officially, this also seemed like a big whoops).  I wasn't COMPLETELY turned off, so T and I will probably go back to try the pizza and wine at some point. I hope there are some other customers then! I'm hoping the ambiance and mood would seem cheerier with other folks around.",

However, the salad did grow on me (I'm not used to so many croutons- but I think that's what most people like about salads- yes?) The portions were generous and the food was delicious. I had a green pepper pizza pie (small- and it was plenty with the larger size salad- I have half the pizza left for a snack before bed!). My husband had the sausage linguine- THREE good-sized sausages! We were impressed.  Bobby was our server. He was attentive, professional and willing to laugh. Our beverages were kept full. The restaurant is entirely smoke-free (YAY!!!) AND still has a small bar. The lighting and music were perfect. Next time I may prefer sitting toward the middle instead of off to the side only because when the dessert case is opened a bright light is released (I saw many people go toward the light and they seemed to enjoy it). But nevertheless, our experience was overwhelmingly pleasant and we will be back... soon!",

I was a little disappointed that they charged $7 for a kids' portion of noodles with Alfredo sauce, but....it was hands down the best Alfredo I have ever tasted. Ever. Best.   My other kids shared a pizza, which had the potential to be outstanding but the underside of the crust was burnt so that kind of ruined the taste.

We kept it simple, a large pie with extra cheese, that's all. It was a big pie,with a generous amount of cheese. The crust tasted RIGHT, like salty Italian bread and not this buttery sweet dough that seems to be common today. The tomato sauce tasted good as well so it was all good.  Why not 4 stars? Because the dough needs to better stretched, with the crust thinner and more consistent - it was very thin on center but a bit too thick overall. Also it was toasted a little too long, and a bit burned on the outside. The pie at the next table was the same so it was not a fluke - still, better crunchy than than soggy.   The other thing was the tomato sauce was good but lacked spices. All together a perfectly good classic pizza, nothing more, nothing less.",

Wow, that's a lot of food. 11\" sub & a bucket of fries. The cheese steak was really good. I've been back since and the last two times I've gotten the meatball parm sub. For 8 bucks, this is a tasty and filling lunch option. No sides come with it but you don't need them with the size of this sandwich. Great flavor and I like the soft and chewy bread. Fair warning: let that thing cool down a bit, it'll gitcha if you're not careful. A burnt mouth: ain't no one got time for that.",

It seems that you could hardly find an Italian spot-around here, but so far Angela did us a favor by providing the best real sauce they use.  Although their pasta e fagioli is not exactly how it supposed to be, but that's just one thing!    Pizza is great! all in all- it's great!",

    "text": "There is the best Italian Restaurant in Charlotte! This is a family favorite and Charlotte's best Italian food! My parents introduced Angela's to my wife and I and it became an instant favorite. We live 30 minutes north of Charlotte and it's ALWAYS worth the drive.   The staff is extremely friendly and makes you feel at home. When you sit down, you are welcomed with hot bread and butter. When it's time to order, my wife and I usually get the eggplant parm. The meal comes with a salad. It's always cooked perfectly and the sauce is unbelievable, fresh and flavorful. I would say it's the best sauce in Charlotte. Portion size is perfect.  We have also had their Chicken Vesuvio. This was my Mom's favorite. She loved the different flavors the plate offers. The chicken is always cooked perfect; tender and full of flavor.   The pizza is good too. Fresh dough made daily and the sauce is always good. They put the perfect amount on too. Pizza needs the perfect amount of sauce. The ingredients are always fresh.   It's a must. You'll enjoy the meal and you'll be back!",

The way you talk to your waitresses is a clear reason why there's a new  people all the time. You need to do better. The food isn't good either. The sauce is canned tomatoes you can't fool me, and the cheese cake is bought.. and my mom(a real Italian woman) knows your lemoncello is garbage.  The mushrooms are canned. I know canned food. I went to culinary school. The pizza is super oily. stop saying your food is made in house because it's not. The same liquor has been at the bar for forever. Get new liquor Linda. The business at Angela's is still trash.  I wish I could rate this a zero. All people wishing or waiting to eat here. Don't. The people are dickheads and the food taste like Chef Boyardee. There are amazing mom and pop shops in mint Hill Matthews. Not Angela's. BE smart!!",

I typically get the Veal Parm. It's tasty and tender. I've also had spaghetti, gnocchi, and chicken Parm, and they have all been outstanding. I can also vouch for the eggplant rollatini - one of my wife's favorites.   The appetizers have been great.  We've had the calamari and the mozzarella caprese on several occasions, and they have been great.   I don't usually get dessert, although I had a cannoli the once. Home run!!  To top all of that off, the prices here are very reasonable. Most entrees are in the $10-15 range.  You're getting the best Italian food in the area for a price that's almost half of what other joints are charging.  Angela's is a can't miss!",

My waiter was also the bartender and since I was the only person there and a couple was sitting at the bar he understandably had to split his time between us(not a packed dining room).......so why am I waving my hand like a 1st grader to get some service?  Geez........I was so pissed when I left it will probably be a minute if I decide to return.",

It has ambiance and props that strongly support the Italian theme, however the food is boring and lackluster. I had the calamari (from the appetizer section) and my daughter had the Philly cheesesteak. She had no real issues with her food other than it being dry and over cooked. The calamari was missing calamari (seriously, no meat inside) and the batter was totally unseasoned. Thank goodness for the red (marinara or salsa?!) sauce to make them edible. The waitress was the best part of our experience. She was very attentive (although we were literally the only customers during the lunch hours) and friendly. When this place closes down, I hope a good restaurant picks the waitress up. She was great! I'm not gonna say they're not gonna make it, stranger things have happened. Maybe hire a chef with taste buds, or at least serve fresh seafood and meats equivalent to the prices you charge. Not frozen, quick-fry/bake foods. Im not saying you should change anything, I'm not saying you should fire your chef, I'm just sayin...But I really liked the waitress.",

Another five star review and another compliment of serving up some great Italian food.(IMO I happen to think it's the best in Charlotte)  I have tried many others, some even at the cost of a higher priced tab and was left far from impressed.  If I could sum up in one word how great this restaurant is it would be *consistently* They are consistently delicious. Never have I been sorry for ordering a dish.  Since my first visit/review I have tried almost all they offer including the pizzas which also can be included IMO of being best in Charlotte.  Took friends last night to indulge in some fine Italian cuisine and some pre Holiday Christmas cheer and the place was decorated with such inviting Christmas decor.   No Bah Hambug here. Tis' the season for giving another 5 star review to you Angela's!",

I don't hand out 5 stars for pizza easily, but the honest truth is that this is one of the best pizzas in Charlotte.  Many people don't know about it because the location sucks.  If it were in one of the destination neighborhoods this place would be packed.  It's not close to me, over a 30 minute drive.  So when I do stop by it's always a treat.  I haven't had the chance to speak with the owner and learn about their process, but I can tell they use great ingredients and know what they're doing when it comes to making pizza dough.  My most recent pie was a White pizza (forgot to take a pic, sorry).  I grabbed it to go so it sat in a box for 15 minutes, but the crust still had the great stone cooked texture I like.  It had a bit of chew and a little snap, without being tough.  The flavor of the dough was also nice.  It's one of those crusts you just have to eat when you get to the end.  Too bad it's a little out of the way for many Charlotteans, but it's worth a trip if you really like seeking out great pizza.",

    "text": "So we headed to Angela's for my cousins birthday and to Chad E's amazement I am sure,  the place actually had quite a crowd.   According to my grandmother Frank Sinatra was there...but really it was just a guy and his keyboard - playing My Way like one would expect. He was good, not great.   I was a bit sad I couldn't order the smaller lunch portion since I wasn't super hungry but prices were reasonable (about $13 for dinner portion lasagna- and a salad). I opted out of bread since the table ordered garlic knots. I've had better at pizza places- not a fan of warm bread products being sold with chilled marinara. They also did not have a personal pizza option so my cousin was left with a pizza that could have easily been split three ways - which is fine for leftovers but kind of bad if you are looking to have one calorie laden day not two or three.   My lasagna was meat-centric. The meat was a bit salty but I probably wouldn't have noticed if it had been used just slightly less. It looked more like a pile of mashed Parmesan-covered meatballs then lasagna. Very sparse on noodles and an even smaller amount of mozzarella : ( .  Taste-wise the sauce is great, and this could be one of the best in town if they just used the proper proportions.   The birthday celebration portion was great. We were served a delicious chocolate raspberry cake that had a sparkler on top. The entire restaurant (led by Frank of course) sang happy birthday...not for the bashful but certainly a lot of fun.  Service wasn't anything out of the ordinary but when we left the hostesses did an excellent job of making sure our meals were satisfactory.",

The service was slow, uncoordinated, unprofessional, and over-solicitous when the bill came. (Big tip, please!)  The food, which had been consistent previously, was blandly plated, poorly prepared, and meager on the important stuff.  My guy had Shrimp Scampi and received only 5 medium shrimp with his pasta.  Insert sad face here.  My Chicken Penne al a Vodka sauce was light on the sauce and heavy on the over grilled, tough chicken pieces.  This had been my favorite dish at this venue.  The minestrone was unremarkable, the salads were just okay, but the hot bread was crusty and tasty, as before. So that's something I guess.  Although this had been my favorite Italian place in this vicinity, we will be unlikely to return.  Major bummer...",

Instead they argued that WE made the mistake and the managers dodged our calls only to relay the message through their very rude hostess that it's too late to be refunded. I'm not sure why a restaurant would spend over an hour arguing with their customer for a mistake they themselves made, all the while changing their tune on what exactly their policy is in a situation like this. Just fix the problem quickly and efficiently like anyone else with common sense would do or better yet, shut your doors.",

    "text": "My family likes Angela's.  My wife and teenage son enjoy the Penne Alla Vodka.  I like the Bolognese sauce, and the Marinara with Meatballs. I have also had, and liked, the pasta and sausage dish. Both chicken parm and veal parm are pretty good.  The bread is fresh and warm, delicious with butter.  This is not a fancy place-- just sort of basic family run Italian food, at moderate prices.  For higher end Italian, go downtown to Luce, or Park Road for Fiamma.  Angela's is casual and basic, somewhat similar to Portofino on Eastway, I think.   This restaurant is in an out of the way location in the Mint Hill area, but the experience is comfortable enough that we don't mind the 15 minute drive.",

    "text": "You know what, good for you Angela's...against all odds, you hold your own...Kudos to you!  This place is located in a very unassuming shopping center off of Margaret Wallace Road.  There used to be a snowcone place on the same strip and it was robbed so they closed down.  The gas station across the street tends to bring about every criminal in the greater metro area and truly there is nothing else on this side of town worth your while so you have to be intentionally seeking out Angela's if you don't live in this area.  All that to say---even though it doesn't have the glitz and glam or the notoriety of other restaurants, they truly do hold their own.  Their pizza is very good (crispy crust, not soggy), their meatballs and marinara sauce are very good (trademark of any good Italian restaurant), their calzones are tasty and even their salads are good.  The atmosphere is that of a typical, old school Italian restaurant..nothing great.   I would say if you happen to be in this area then stop by...but chances are you aren't going to be in this area if you don't live over here but I would advise making it your business to give Angela's a try if you are craving good solid Italian food.  We all know that Charlotte is hurting a little bit in terms of authentic Italian restaurants and Angela's definitely puts a band-aide on that problem.  Give them a try, they won't disappoint.",

    "text": "Edited to correct a couple of 'fat fingered spelling/word erros' while typing this ---While I am aware that everybody has different tastes opinions and etc, The 1 opinion I've seen a few people post, I really don't understand.  The bread is homemade and made fresh daily. Personally, I think their bread is terrific.  I've been a regular for quite some time. While I do not know the owner(s) personally, I do know them simply by eating there as often as I do and they, nor any employee has ever been rude to me, nor have I ever seen them be rude to anybody else.  I've seen a couple people claim they are unethical by charging more then indicated. I find that sort of odd since its never happened to me and after so many meals there, Id think if this was common, I would have had it done to me by now. Yet, I can only say the actual opposite has happened. Normally, if I am paying with cash and the bill is xx.57, if I dont have any change in my pocket, they just normally round it down. I have cash. They could easily take it and then give me my .43cents change. Which they obviously do many times, but honestly, more times then not they hand me back a $1bill I gave them and round the bill down.   Pretty nice of them, imo. Considering I've eaten at places in which if you want a small dollop of sauce which comes with your meal, but they give you such a minuscule amount, you'd like a spoonful more. I have had places actually make me pay .25cents on my credit card cause I had no cash or change, but the meal simply would not be as good without that extra .25cents of sour cream or etc..... So, I give them my CC just to get a spoonful of sour cream, that they honestly should give you enough of and if not, dont be so anal and make a customer pay .25cents on their credit card when your tab is well over $75++ and your wait staff is going to get at least a 25-35% tip.  In any event, with that out of the way, how is the food?  I think its terrific. Many many meals eaten there and have never been disappointed. Quality is excellent, portions are generous and prices are rather good as compared to other places serving the same dish that isnt even as good.  The NY style pizza is pretty darned good, imo. The veal and chicken dishes are always good, as is the seafood and many pastas and baked pasta dishes. The Calzones and sandwiches are quite good and priced right. Meatball Parm, Cheese Steak, Sausage and Peppers, all very good.  They always have daily specials on the board, and Ive never ordered one and end up disappointed. Normally its either me and my girl or us and 1 or 2 other couples (2-6 people normally). I can honestly say, nobody I have ever been there with has been disappointed. Normally we are all sampling each others food and normally we all love our meals as well as the others in our group.  I will say that Italian food is quite subjective based on each individuals likes and dislikes and etc. I love Marsala Wine sauce for instance. Depending on where you eat it will always be different then other places you eat. Doesn't mean those are bad and the others are good, but sure, I like so and so's better then so and so's, which doesnt mean any were bad. It simply means I like one better then the other, which I think is True not just with sauces, but with most all Italian food in general.  One other thing I like about this place is I have some 'favorite dishes', that are not on their menu. If they have the ingredients to make what I want, they do it. And while Id be willing to pay more, they normally just charge me whatever a similar dish costs. I love Veal Saltinboca for instance. If I want it, they make it and charge me for whatever the Veal Marsala etc is priced at. Ive been to alot of Italian restaurants and most will not accommodate you in this manner. Some do, but normally they charge you more, which is understandable and 100% acceptable to me. Angelas never charges me more. They could and perhaps should...and Id happily pay the extra money. But they don't.  So all and all, I think the food is great, prices very very reasonable and even if the staff is overwhelmed, they are always nice and polite and in instances like that, which does occur, they will normally bring a free round of drinks or a couple of free appetizers, free deserts for everybody or etc...without us even asking for it or complaining...& whatever they bring comes with a sincere apology that they are as busy as they are.  So, I give this 5 stars. And as always, will encourage people to take all reviews including mine with a grain of salt and go yourself, try it and form your own opinion.",

The train really started to derail when they wanted an extra 75 cents for a couple spoonfuls of sauce to take with the leftover half of a calzone.  The service was terrible, they took about 10-15 minutes to bring a bill, and when they brought back the receipt to sign after charging the credit card... It was for six dollars more than the original bill was for. She claimed that when she went to swipe the card she noticed it only had one soft drink instead of three, So she added two more. The catch was, there were only two soft drinks... So it was overcharging by one drink. She didn't seem to grasp why I would want some explanation or communication for a receipt being more than the bill.  She claimed to be \"the old one who knows what's going on\", and was hustling hard, but didn't seem very competent at her job.",

He went back a 2nd time and came home with the right food but the pizza was burnt and cheese was all over the place. I personally went back up to the restaurant with the pizza and requested to speak with the manager. I was told the manager was not there and they call me back. After 2 weeks, my husband went back to the restaurant and was once again given the run around and still no one has called us back.

    "text": "I must have entered the twilight zone yesterday when I had my first visit here. First of all, when we arrived the door had a sign on it that said \"Kitchen closed everyday from 2:30-3:30.\" It was 2:00pm when we arrived, and the door was so hard to open, we thought it was locked already. A server finally walked to the door, and gave us an attitude and said the door was just \"hard to open.\" I was with my 80 year old grandmother, there was no way she would have been able to open the door. We asked if it was ok to come in and eat since they would be closing soon, to which she responded \"I guess.\"   We finally got inside and before we even sat down and situated she was asking us what we wanted to drink. I asked her to bring us waters to start and let us at least sit down and glance at the menu before we decide on drinks.   We ordered an antipasto cold app to start. She brought us the completely wrong app (without plates I might add) and told us if we wanted the correct appetizer we ordered then we would have to pay for both. I told her that was absurd!!! She made the mistake, she should bring us the correct app without us paying for both. It had already been 30 minutes and we were pretty damn hungry.   We were finally able to order a pizza after I had to get up from the table to find our server standing behind the bar doing nothing. I will add there was only one other table in the entire restaurant. The pizza took an hour to make!! We asked her why it was taking so long, and she told us she \"forgot to ring it in because she screwed up her other table's checks.\" At this point it was 3:45 and I had to be at a 4:00 appointment. I was completely shocked she admitted to these mistakes and never once apologized. When the pizza arrived it was slightly burnt, not brought out on a pizza stand, and the toppings fell right off when you picked it up. We threw it in a box and had to leave, still hungry and beyond annoyed.   I asked her if I could speak to a manager because of our ridiculous experience. She said he was not there but I could talk to the kitchen staff?! I've been in the service industry for 13 years and never dealt with anything like this.  There was absolutely no excuse for the service or experience we had at this place. We will not be returning and I will be contacting management for a refund since they weren't present to comp our meals yesterday.",

    "text": "Went there today. Was told 20 minutes. Waited there for 60 minutes then they tried to not give us our calzone and mozzarella sticks which was 2 out of the 3 items ordered. The people were rude then refused to give us our money back when we wanted to leave. We were told the owner was not there. We can definitely tell as the employees were definitely not interested in customer service. Bread was soggy on the eggplant parmesan. Food was cold and mozzarella sticks rubber as if sitting out forever. The Alfredo tastes like it was made with American cheese. The calzone was at least decent.",

    "text": "Two persons in my party ordered baked ziti.  Meh.  It wasn't truly baked--looked just like pasta straight out of hot water. Worst thing, though--there was a mix-up in the bill.  One of the adult members of my party ordered a child's portion, and when the bill was presented, that's what was listed.  However, the actual credit card charge was higher than the bill amount.  It was up-charged to the lunch price. I've no problem with the policy--but it smacks of a lack of integrity to charge more on the credit card than was on the bill, without an explanation from either the wait person or the owner/manager.   With so many choices in Italian food, I prefer dealing with establishments where food served matches the menu listing, and where there's no attempt to sneak in higher charges.",
