We received a complimentary champagne toast upon arrival along with many staff stopping by to wish us a happy anniversary. What an extremely kind and thoughtful gesture! We had an overall wonderful experience - great ambience, attentive service, and incredible food. The 75 and Sunny cocktail is very refreshing with a little spice to it. The oysters Rockefeller were out of this world! And our main course certainly did not disappoint. We will be back again soon!

Not one person checked on us. Ate undercooked meat and had attitudes everywhere!",

Spent 500 (without tip) for four people for bland tasting moderate quality steaks, none were done to temperature requests, sent two back to the grill, manager came over immediately to apologize and replaced a couple sides, but for two $60 filets to be severely undercooked after a 1 hour 30 minute wait (restaurant was only 1/3 full) causing us a bad business-customer meeting, and not offering to take the steaks off the bill is unacceptable. Would NEVER risk taking business clients here for fear of a bad experience, and would never do business with again as they don't understand the customer experience in the upper tier premium value segment they are trying to play in.",

So we arrive 7:20pm, introduce ourselves to the hostess, she says \"Happy Anniversary but I'm sorry to say we don't have a Mariachi band available tonight.\" Haha, funny! Takes us to our table, leaves, super nice young lady.

Funny AF!  The food was off the charts, really cool staff, great service, nice ambiance. Thumbs up on the Porkbelly/MacCheese, bussle sprouts, carpaccio, nice wine list, Debragga NY strip was just stupid good, creme brulee cheese cake.....We Uber'd it home, snorted a Crestor and passed out in a drunken food coma.

We have searched for a comparable steakhouse to our New York favorites for 12 years. We have not been successful until now. Steaks were cooked to perfection as well as the sides and the cocktails. We were warmly greeted by practically the entire staff during our dining experience. It was a treat to be able to complement the head chef Alex. We highly recommend this restaurant and it's perfect staff and supreme service.  Thank you to everyone for a great evening!",

    "text": "We went to try out this new-ish restaurant in Southpark for Queen's Feast. The decor is stylish and upscale. Attire ranged anywhere from business casual to Country Club casual.   Immediately we ordered drinks and sat in the comfy seating near the bar. Our dining companions had arrived before us and had ordered a bottle of wine and the meat and cheese appetizer. They said it was so good they ate it all before we got there. I ordered a filthy dirty martini. Our server asked if I wanted it like Miley Cyrus used to be-very funny comment. The martini was EXCELLENT. I know this restaurant is big on bourbon but we skipped that. Once we moved to our table, our bar server followed us to the table and got a bottle of wine and water. Our \"real\" server was Bruce and he kept us on track. I will say this steakhouse has plenty of options besides steak. I will tell you that the filet and bone-in filet were superior. They melted in your mouth. Both pieces were cooked to order. Bruce brought out the executive chef, Alex, who said they get the meat locally. The meat is the star!   All the yelp reviews said not to miss the pork belly mac and cheese. It was amazing and the family size portion gave everyone a nice serving of it. Don't miss it!   Queens feast included dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake. Our table thought it was below average. The cake did not diminish our experience. It's a great addition to the steakhouse scene in Charlotte.",

It should be in the circle with other popular restaurants. The seating is lacking something but I'm not sure what. The folks there seemed to try really hard but for the money I would suggest the Palm. At least at the Palm they sorta get it. This place is very expensive but they don't seem to understand the concept. The food had some bright spots. The Palm at one time had some great fried onions. They dropped them. If you go to Oak start with a burger & onions. Don't drop $100.00 per person until they prove worthy. You better hurry. I doubt they will last until the lease is up or a good recession hits. By all means try it. The wine menu is a menagerie. Good luck with navigating your way through it.Maybe the guy who owns Mid-wood BBQ will buy the place. He at least knows how to make a restaurant work long enough to flip it.",

I always come as soon as they open at 5pm and am usually the only one there. I sit at the bar and order.  It takes 20-30 minto get my burger...this happened twice in a row. And when I finally get my food, the burger is undercooked! Are you kidding me!? I'm the ONLY person here. Its absurd. Just now I got my burger, asked for Medium,but received it Rare/Medium Rare and there was no Char that usually makes the burger great and it was under seasoned. This place has issues with timing as it pertains to its food and I've know. It from the get go but the convenience and quality of food always got me back. Now I receive this subpar burger and frankly I wish I went to Rusty Bucket. Nope...I wont be back. Great bartenders and great music. Shitty kitchen.",

They directed us to the over crowded bar where we waited for 15 min before anyone looked at us to serve us. Now it's not that they were rude but having 2 people manage and make all drinks for a restaurant is a bit overwhelming. After waiting for 35 min we asked again and they informed us that it would be the next table up. After more people left and a couple who came in 20 min after us sat down I asked why it was taking so long. They apologized and sat us within the next 10 min- that being said we waited over an hour from our reservation time. However management was trying to be very accommodating but kinda ruined a romantic night out.   The steak was quite good but I did not think it was the best steak I've ever had to expect the price. The Brussels sprouts were good but I've had better and the lobster Mac and cheese was skimping the lobster and flavor. Again the steak cooked perfect and it was delicious but not worth the wait or price.    I would try their Charleston location but do not think I'll go back to the one in Charlotte. It doesn't hold a candle to the experience we get a Hall's chophouse in Charleston which is what some reveries claim.",

    "text": "My mom, cousin and I went to Oak Steakhouse on a Thursday evening for drinks and appetizers around 6:30 p.m. I did make a reservation and upon arrival we were seated quickly. I had been wanting to try this restaurant out for months because I saw posts about it on Charlotte Agenda's Instagram page and then started following Oak's Instagram page. Unfortunately it was not the dining experience I hoped for, but it also was not terrible. Like other reviews mentioned, the service was slow and the time it took for the food and drinks to come out was absolutely ridiculous! That is the one thing I actually hated about the restaurant. The decor is perfect and that is one of the main reasons I wanted to give the restaurant a try. It's a somewhat smaller restaurant but with an open and airy feel. I'm in love with the dark hardwood floors, dark tables and chairs (minus the cute red booth in the center of the restaurant) and high ceilings. The food was pretty good to me, everything seasoned perfectly. I had shrimp cocktail and scallops for my appetizer. Although both were VERY good, I hate lukewarm food and my scallops could have been a little hotter. For my meal I had the oak salad and added steak on top. I was in love! IF I ever decide to go back I would definitely get all the items I ordered again. The drinks were definitely yummy! I did not see a drink I wanted on the menu so I asked the server to ask the bartender to make something light and fruity and the bartender did their thing, taste wise. However I do feel they were a little stingy with the alcohol. I did not taste a whole lot of it in my drink. Disappointing. Last but not least, our server. So our server was not bad at all. He just didn't seem all that interested in his job and I didn't feel he was as attentive as he should have been. He did check on us, however there were times I had to flag him down for another drink or food order. He was young, and just overall had a weird disposition. One thing I did appreciate was the manager coming over and apologizing about how long our food took. I was actually a little surprised by how long we waited each time we ordered food. There could possibly be an issue with the amount of kitchen staff they currently have because one large party should not stop the flow of the restaurant. All in all I am unsure if I will be back. I feel the customer service can be improved and the length of time it takes for the food to come out can be improved. Stronger drinks would have been nice too. My bill was $96 and I left the server an additional $15. If I do decide to go again I'll probably just sit at the bar.",

    "text": "Hello Excellent Steak, goodbye bonus check. Ok, maybe a little dramatic. My wife and I went there this weekend. Easily made a reservation, and they gave us a great booth. Very nice , open atmosphere and not too congested. We shared the Burrata salad, Christina has the bone in filet, I had the ribeye (which they said they've heard is the best in Charlotte) the lobster Mac and Brussel sprouts. Add in two desserts and two glasses of wine, and we had a bill approaching 3 bills after tip. Holy crap.   The ribeye and filet were generous, cooked to perfection, and very tasty. (I think they're a little too proud about the Certified Angus Beef rating- that isn't all that special.  The lobster Mac was delicious, and the apple tart dessert was better than the chocolate mousse pie.   In all, the service was very good, and the food was as well. However, it wasn't that unique to be priced this high.  A good meal, just be ready come check time.",

The ambiance was perfect with low lighting, soft music, and spacious enough to not feel like your own type of each other. For an appetizer I ordered the family size lobster mac and cheese which was delicious. The bread they served was warm and fresh served with homemade sweet butter. For our main course I got the burger and my boyfriend got a rib-eye steak. Both were fantastic! Place is pricey but I can admit it was worth it. This is a nice once in a while treat and I will definitely go back. I recommend making a reservation!",

They've made a nice looking steakhouse.   The food was spectacular. We both ordered filets and my boyfriend added a lobster tail. As sides we ordered the crispy potatoes and the Brussels sprouts. We spilt an Oak Salad to start. I had the dressing for the salad placed on the side since I'm not a huge dressing person and that worked out perfectly!  The filet has a really nice char to it. My boyfriend loves how large the serving of the lobster was. Both of us loved the sides. I did notice some people think the sides are too salty, but I thought they were great.  Service was quite good.   I will say, you can go to other steakhouses for a similar experience and quality for less cost. I did hear there is a bar menu though... so I'm sure I'll be back!!",

We were a party of four with a 7:45 reservation, so I wouldn't think the staff would have been in such a hurry. To be fair, some people would have been fine with the pace, but it was a little quick for me.   The real disappointment were the steaks. When I order a $39 filet, I expect the person cooking it to know what he or she is doing and for there to be some char on it - some, at minimum. There was no char on any of the four we ordered. What a waste of high-quality beef! We ordered four sides: Brussels, lobster mac and cheese, pork belly mac and cheese and the jalapeno corn bread. All were fine, but not impressive.   Lastly - dinner bread. This seemed like sad grocery store bread - not the kinda good stuff Harris Teeter might bake in-store. Sad bread that apparently wasn't worth bothering to heat all the way through.   To be fair, we didn't alert anyone that we didn't enjoy the food. Complaining is so tiresome and I didn't want freebies - I wanted a great meal, but that opportunity had come and gone for March 6. I'd recommend Capitol Grill, Beef N Bottle or any number of other steakhouses ahead of this one. There's a Ruths Chris right around the corner too.",

Because a 3 course meal is only $35. We weren't expecting to get the caliber of food and service we received. My husband and I both ordered the Summer Salad, 8oz CAB Filet- with whipped potatoes and seasonal greens. I had the peach cobbler and he had the Queens Chocolate Cake. The salad was a beautiful a light locally sourced delicious way to start the meal. The steak!!! We have had a steak at pretty much every high end steak house and restaurant in Charlotte. This steak blew most of them away!!! It was absolute perfection. High quality meat, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, just delicious! The peach cobbler was every southern girls dream. I will order it every time I see it on the menu... yes even over the chocolate cake! Our server Grace made our experience even better. She was knowledgeable and fun. She was able to answer questions about food and wine we had. She definitely added to the overall experience of our night and we will be requesting her whenever we make reservations in the future.",

The ceilings are impossibly high, the decor is cold, lights were too bright and the tables & chairs were out of place. The two top tables were really tight (think Valentine's Day crammed together). It was not the romantic atmosphere we anticipated. The service was great and the food was fine. We had oysters, tuna, rib eye and Brussel sprouts.

(Warning:  Don't wear extremely high heels, the restaurant floor is very slick) 6 of us had a girl's night for a birthday and I was interested to try a new restaurant.  I got the pork ravioli and the soup that day was a corn jalapeno soup.  I strongly recommend not getting the pork ravioli. The pasta was tough and the pork inside was flavorless. However, the soup was excellent.  It seemed to also have a curry flavor to it. I got the creme brulee cheesecake for dessert and, OMG, it was amazing !  It had a crystalized crust on the top and cheesecake-flavored custard underneath with a sugary crust.  (I think a shortbread-like cookie crust would have been better ... I couldn't eat the crust because it was way too sweet)  I sampled some of my friend's items. I did not care for the 3 cheese lobster grits, they had a bit of a bite to them as if they could have cooked a bit longer.  In fact, she didn't eat it. We tried the pot of creme and it was nice, but again I'd pass next time.  One girl got the ice cream donut and didn't care for it much.  We all agreed the creme brulee cheesecake was divine and we all should have stuck with that.  One gal got the steak and I took a sample. It was very good, but a bit too much salt in the rub on the outside for my taste but she seemed happy with it.",

    "text": "After winning a gift card on Yelp for Indigo Road Restaurant Group my choices were Oak or O-Ku. Who doesn't love an incredible piece of meat? So, Oak it was! It was a special evening celebrating my girlfriend's Birthday.  There is a large parking deck attached with FREE parking, that's a plus! Oak also offers complimentary valet parking.  I made a last minute reservation on Open Table. Very easy site to use... I highly recommend making your reservations through OT! We ending up running a few minutes late, but were still quickly seated. It took a few more minutes before we saw a server to place a drink order. Sort of confusing because I think a couple different people showed up to our table, not really sure who our waiter was supposed to be - at first. They quickly filled our table glasses with quenching ice water. She settled on the Carolina Summer cocktail and He went for a Makers and ginger. The Carolina Summer was very tasty and refreshing.   As we sipped on our drinks and chatted, I mentioned to my girlfriend it sure would be nice if they offered bread to munch on while we browsed the menu... It wasn't 2 minutes later and a basket of rolls and butter appeared at the table. Magic!  After browsing the menu, we figured we would split a 12 ounce filet mignon (medium) and sides of brussel sprouts and crispy potatoes. They stated because of the style of cooking it would take some extra time for filet to be prepared. Not a problem at all, we were not in a hurry. It didn't seem like much longer than any other steakhouse when it all came out to the table. They even halved the filet for us, how fantastic!  My take on this meal: WOW WOW WOW! One WOW for each item! Fantastic, tasty, delicious, yummy, all those big words... What an incredible piece of meat - And I'm not talking about myself :-) .. I know I have been working out.. But, I digress. Everything was wonderful down to the homemade steak sauce, which you really didn't need at all.  We tried not to overindulge on the sides, but that was tough given their deliciousness. I had to force myself to focus on the finishing my half of the filet and we box of the remaining sides for weekend leftovers. Great idea. The waiter dropped off the obligatory dessert menu and then eventually the check as we passed on the sweets. He was nice enough to allow to spend a few minutes chatting post-dinner and enjoying each others company... My girlfriend and I, not the waiter and I.. But, I digress. I highly recommend Oak Steakhouse to anyone and everyone.",

Entrees: Filet Mignon and 20oz Bone-in Ribeye were both delicious and cooked to perfection.    Side dishes:  1.  Jalapeno cornbread - not too spicy, sweet and the texture almost made this pass as a dessert. Will order this again and again!  2.  Brussels sprouts - with a maple glaze these are a must. Even if you don't like Brussels, these will taste like heaven to you!  3.  Lobster Mac and cheese - creamy, large chunks of lobster and very flavorful.   Delicious, delicious, delicious. Excellent service. Couldn't have asked for more!  A nice change from the usual Charlotte restaurants!",

We don't eat bacon and let the server know as we told him our choices off the menu. After we ordered he came back and let us know that the lobster Mac and cheese had bacon in it - something not all restaurants do. My wife's steak was perfectly cooked and the horseraddish was fresh. The service was outstanding (from the manager to our server) and we even got recommendations from another server who knew we were from out of town. Overall great experience and you even get a coffee cake for breakfast the next day on the way out. What a great way to end the night.",

This restaurant should only be utilize as a means to an end, it does not scream \"steak during the week\" type of place.  Probably great for special occasions or business.",

Grilled octopus was tasty, different m, but tasty. Had a BBQ kind of flavor, would certainly get again.   Entree- filet was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Friend got the KC bone in strip and he loved it, also cooked and seasoned perfectly. Wife had the lobster carbonara and she crushed it. Though she only allowed me 1 bite, it was indeed delicious.  Sides- Brussel sprouts were delicious. Lobster Mac and cheese was great, coulda have had a few more pieces of lobster in my opinion, but was good none the less. Jalapeno cornbread was phenomenal! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy (not too spicy).  Dessert- wife wanted the chocolate cake even though I hate chocolate (don't judge me!), we compromised on the lemon cake, and Joanna our waitress hooked it up with the chocolate cake as well which my wife appreciated lol. The lemon was MOIST...yeah I said it. And my wife loved the chocolate cake!   Overall this was a good experience, great location, great food and great ambience! We will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Sooo, it took us longer than it should have to find the door. In our defense, we found ourselves wandering around outside with another couple having the same trouble. There's a big sign on the wall, but you totally miss it if you're coming from the parking deck. Oops.  Once we entered, we were greeted promptly, but there seemed to be a little bit of chaos at the hostess stand. Our reservation was for 6:30 pm on a Saturday, and the place wasn't too packed when we got there, but it was hopping when we left!  Our waitress was great - personable, helpful with decisions, and pretty prompt (until the end when we waited a pretty long time to get a port - but she totally acknowledged it, which I really appreciated). We started with the pork ravioli since it's not an appetizer you see anywhere else, and it was yummmmy. Also divine were the yeast rolls they brought. For dinner, we got steak (of course we did). I got the 8 oz filet which was more expensive and smaller than the one at The Palm. I ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. It had seasoning on it that reminded me of Del Frisco's - a good thing. The fella and I split the pork belly mac and cheese side, and I almost made myself sick on it... mmmmm. Between the Yelp reviews and our waitress' recommendation, we went with the creme brulee cheesecake - it was like a regular cheesecake with a hard shell. Tasty.   The ambiance isn't quite my style since it sorta feels like a restaurant in an office building with super tall ceilings and no intimacy (maybe because that's actually what it is?), but the bar was pretty. Service was pretty well spot-on and the food was more creative than what you find at other steakhouses. Dress code seems to lean toward business casual, but the fella was in jeans and was fine.",

I said it was all good except I saw another table receive a slice of cake for their birthday and it would have been nice if this had been brought out for my wife since you knew it was her birthday as well.

I actually went with the grouper, which was absolutely fantastic. Perfectly prepared and an appropriate portion size. The rest of my party got a steak and there were zero complaints...everyone thoroughly enjoyed their steak and said they were prepared exactly as requested. Sides, bread and dessert were delicious as well. This is a great steak place and is certainly more \"high end\" but we weren't exactly thinking it would be the Outback. Met and exceeded expectations...I just hope it stays small, less busy and charming (purely for selfish reasons). Highly recommended.",

I called a week ahead to secure our reservation and the manager ensured Oak would make my birthday particularly special :)  We had a group of 16 and our table was prepared upon arrival. The staff was completely accommodating despite having a large party and some being late. I never once felt rushed and our waiters were very informative. Some of our orders were mixed up as far as sides being given to the wrong people, but we ended up just sharing our sides anyways.   I shared the Mixed Grill with a girlfriend, which includes lamb, sliced tenderloin and NY strip. The lamb was cooked to perfection and oh so tender! I loved the fingerling potatoes that came with the dish. However, the strip and tenderloin both lacked flavor. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, truffle frites and brussel sprouts as sides to share. All delicious, but surprisingly the sprouts were my favorite! For dessert, the staff gave me a complimentary creme brulee cheesecake (check pic! How cute?!) and I also tried the butterscotch cookie. Both were delicious. I ended the meal with a French press to complement my dessert and it was perfect!  Thank you Oak for accommodating our group and for making little ole me feel so special. Will be back!",

    "text": "This was my second time dining at this restaurant. This first experience was outstanding. This time I was somewhat disappointed. I made a reservation for one for 7pm on 7/17 and arrived at approx 6:55. The hostess told me that there were no tables available and ask that I sit on the couch until one was available. As I'm waiting for a table a couple walks in and was immediately seated. Thinking they must have been joining another group I didn't think much of it. A short time later a second couple comes in and again immediately seated. This happened once more when two guys came in and immediately shown a table for two. The manager then came to me and stated that he was still working on getting me a table. He offered that I sit at the bar or at the high table near the bar. I then asked him why several people had come in after me and were immediately seated when there was \"supposedly\" no tables available? He stated that they must of had prior reservations. I'm thinking isn't my 7p reservation any good? Finally I am seated at a table for 4! After I'm seated I notice that there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant and remained that way the entirety of my dinner. I really am trying to love this restaurant as the food is damn good but when customer service sucks it doesn't matter how good the food is!. This just left a very bad taste in my mouth. Especially if they consider themselves to be fine dining establishment. In full disclosure, the manager, Ciro M, came to my table afterwards and offered his apology for the bad experience.  On a side note: my waiter Aaron, who I had on my previous visit, was outstanding. He was the only saving grace for this bad experience.",

It was lick-the-plate good. Hubby got a filet and it came out cooked perfectly (which is often hard for steakhouses to do on a Friday night). The kiddo devoured the lobster Mac & cheese (though I have to say relative to everything else, this was my least favorite bite). I give extra kudos to the touch of offering some fresh individually packed coffee cakes for the next morning. Brilliant marketing and brand reinforcement right there - as we were clearly thinking of them and talking about our experience around the breakfast table the next morning.

Meal or food quality was mediocre at best. Lobster Mac much over rated, okay, but not as advertised. The ribeye was average as compared to other similar dining steak restaurants. Mexican cornbread was barely a mouth full to say the least and not baked completely.l",

    "text": "I had heard good things about Oak's bar happy hour menu and finally stopped in this past weekend. It's available 7 days a week, which is a win in my book. Around 5:30 on a Saturday my husband and I were able to grab 2 seats at the bar. There were a few parties but plenty of seats. I started with a cocktail which, unfortunately, I forgot the name of. But it was a vodka, Riesling reduction, apple, thyme cocktail. It was really refreshing and not too sweet, and also a little tart. It was perfect for a warm day and honestly, a pretty big drink. My husband grabbed a beer and we also ordered the happy hour burger for $8 and the fried pickles and oysters for $13 to share. I was so impressed by the plates. The burger is massive and comes with a tower of truffle fries. They were nice enough to split it onto 2 plates for us. The burger was flavorful and cooked perfectly, and the fries were addicting. The fried pickles were fresh and nicely battered, as were the oysters. The service at the bar was attentive and friendly but also allowed us to enjoy our meal and drinks. The restaurant itself is very nice and we plan to come back for a full meal.",

We love all the sides, my favorite is the Brussels sprouts, it's on point, the jalapeno corn bread is also very good (I like that they put green onion on it), I added butter to it and it was delicious, I also like that it's mildly sweet and the cast iron keeps it hot and crispy on the side. The crispy potato is my husband favorite. I think I like the sides more than the entree lol. The bad: They over salt the steak. Which is ashamed because it was really tender (my husband said it was the most tender piece of NY strip he had ever had) but the salt ruined it. They also over salt my sword fish, one bite of it and it ruined my palette, the fish wasn't as tender either. I had sword fish at Bonefish and they did a much better job with this fish. Why do they over salt all their meat? I don't want to get high blood pressure after eating dinner!   I'll probably come back again for the sides!!!",

Simple rolls and they tasted commercial though I'm sure they aren't   Salad - little sparse for the price, but their green goddess is on point  Steak - this was the bummer. They fly in specialty dry aged and I ordered it rare-medium rare. It came out mostly medium or more, and with  barely any nutty dry aged flavor. To their credit, they gave a partial discount when I told them not to re-fire one.   Crispy Potato side - tasty. Would order again.   Comped a cheesecake but I wasn't crazy about it.   I may or may not try it again, but they aren't in the Capital Grill league yet IMO",

    "text": "We had made a reservation last minute due to other restaurants being booked, but Oak Steakhouse was somewhere we had always passed by and never tried. We arrived a little early and were told the wait would be a few minutes (which was fine since we were early). Ten minutes past our reservation time, the manager came over to apologize for the delay and said a few groups were hanging around longer than anticipated. Another ten minutes pass and the manager apologizes again saying we should be seated soon, and offers to have an appetizer sent to the table. Probably five more minutes pass before we are actually seated (for those of you not keeping track, that's 25 mins after our reservation time).  I started with a water anticipating ordering a cocktail after the longer wait, but since this was our first visit, I needed a moment to look over the menu. The waiter, Joshua, greeted us and took our drink (water) order, then left to get our drinks. He came back and asked if we wanted an appetizer, but we decided to order entrees and sides (NY strip and ribeye, pork belly mac and cheese and grilled asparagus), and Caesar salads to start. He then took all the menus, including the drinks menu, and didn't ask if I decided on a drink.  Salads came out first, and they were just like any other Caesar, except loaded with Parmesan. The manager stopped by again to apologize further, and presented us with the salmon tartare with a soy glaze. This was delicious. Our main course came out next and I laughed at the size of the cast iron plate the steak was on. I peered at our neighbors and surprisingly their steaks were on actual plates. The steaks were cooked perfectly, but were very salty. I like salt, but goodness, this was too much. My Texan soul died a little. The pork belly mac and cheese shockingly lacked salt, and the pork belly was tough. The grilled asparagus was fine.  Overall, I was disappointed tonight. The service received from Joshua was far different than what I observed with his other tables. For example, he went through all the top choices and his favorites on the menu with the table directly next to us, but quickly rushed to take our order and didn't bother to ask if we had dined at the establishment before. I distinctly felt like he was putting more effort into his customer service with the table of middle aged men as opposed to two younger women on a girls' night out. I'll be honest: I'm not expecting the waitstaff to wipe my nose for me, but the service just did not match up with the price tag. I've had much better service and a better overall experience at other restaurants.  The only saving grace of this experience was the manager, and unfortunately we did not get her name. However, I don't think we will be coming back again.  TL;DR: Manager and tartare were awesome. Service and food did not match up to their prices.",

The Oysters Rockefeller were the best I've ever had and the Caesar salad served with anchovies per my request did not disappoint. I went with a 12oz filet prepared medium rare and I loved it. The lobster mac & cheese along with some whipped potatoes and truffle fries were a perfect compliment to my entree .. I didn't hold back because it was my birthday dinner so why would I? Haha   I washed the meal down with a few Stella Artois draft beers and ended the high end culinary dining experience with a double espresso which really hit the spot.   No shame in their game at the Oak Steakhouse and it's safe to say I'll be back.  Cheers!",

    "text": "Wow is all I have to say about Oak. I've been to many Vegas steakhouses and this ranks up there with them. Friend and I went on a Friday night during Charlotte Restaurant week and ordered off the special menu.  We had the winter salad, the 8 oz filet, and then shared the apple cobbler and chocolate raspberry cake.  The winter salad was delicious. I'm not easily impressed by a salad at all and it barely had any dressing on it but it was superb. The filet was cooked to perfection. Had a nice char on the outside and I ordered mine medium rare and it was melt in your mouth good.  I didn't even use any steak sauce it was so delicious.  It came with whipped mashed potatoes and greens that were equally as amazing. Friend and I shared the two dessert options. The apple cobbler was the winner hands down. The chocolate cake tasted almost like it was frozen and was still thawing. It didn't take away from the dining experience though. Our server was very attentive and always kept our drinks filled.  They had some wines on special for restaurant week that were delicious as well.  There is ample parking that's free inside the parking deck.  There is also complimentary valet parking for Oak as well. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to it, semi-dark so my pictures didn't turn out that great.  They even gave us each a small loaf of coffee cake as we exited to enjoy in the morning.  The regular menu is very pricey but I'm glad that I took this opportunity to give Oak a try and learned that I would love to dine there again sometime.  I heard on Yelp that they have a bar menu and would like to find out more about that before returning.  The food was great and will not disappoint. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. Check them out. I made my reservation ahead of time on Open table which I recommend because it's convenient and easy to use.    Oh, and before I forget, the complimentary bread and butter was also a hit at our table. Nothing but good things to say about this place :)",

Smaller than I expected, but all of the decor is beautiful and we really enjoyed the environment and getting to soak it in for a couple of hours.   We started with the truffle fries before our 3 course dinner because...carbs. They were so good! It was a huge portion and we ate every single one.

When they called to confirm the day before, they asked if we were celebrating anything and I told them.  So fast forward to yesterday's dinner.  We arrived promptly at 7pm, gave them my name, and said \"welcome and happy birthday\".  Ha!  Then we sat down and then the manager (maybe) came to wish him a happy birthday...and then our waitress.  I was laughing, but we were both incredibly impressed by the service and attention to detail for special occasions.  Our waitress was fantastic.  She was very friendly, and didn't know much about the bourbon selection, but was happy to bring us a list when we ordered a second round.  I ordered a glass of Cabernet and it was delicious.  The wine list by the glass has a wonderful selection (but don't expect to pay less than $10 for a glass).  The cocktails looked great, so I'll have to come back for one.  I will say, I was definitely NOT impressed with the fact that they charge for a block of ice for drinks on the rocks.  Don't get me wrong, I know I'm automatically paying a lot for a glass of something on the rocks at a nice upcharge, but you really want to charge me $2 for a block of ice???  Would have been nice to know before so it wasn't a surprise when the bill arrived.  The food was certainly nothing to complain about.  We started with a half portion of the Oak chopped salad and the shrimp cocktail.  Both were nice and light before the heavy meal.  The bread was also a trio of dinner rolls with some sweet butter...almost tasted like we were eating dessert!  We both ordered 8oz filets that were cooked PERFECTLY.  FYI-they have both wet and dry aged steaks for those of you who are connoisseurs.  I also recommend the Brussels (unique and cooked with cumin or some spice...awesome) and the Mac & Cheese (with pork belly in a delicious creamy sauce).  The wonderful ending was the Cheesecake Creme Brulee (get this and thank me later) and the surprise slide of chocolate cake with a candle and Happy Birthday written on the plate!  Overall, great experience, wonderful service and prompt food delivery for each course.  I'll definitely come back for future special occasions.  You certainly get what you pay for, so don't be surprised when the bill comes and it's over $100/person.  Except for the ice block charge...that was unnecessary.",

The good- we ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and they were awesome. Since we were being served by a bartender I didn't expect consistent attention like you would get from a Waitress. But I also didn't expect service to be THAT slow. We eventually got some rolls after a long time. We sat around 7:15 and didn't get our dinner until 9pm. One of the store managers told me the wait was due to the Chefs still cooking my rack of lamb (which was $59). About 10 minutes after, we receive our food. My lamb was COLD, unseasoned, and unflavored. I don't understand why it took them so long to cook the lamb for it to turn out so bland and cold (I ordered my meat medium). I've had other rack of lambs at restaurants similar to Oak & they are far better. My boyfriend order the pork chop and enjoyed his meal. The manager came & apologized and offered to replace my meal or desert. Since I didn't want to wait another hour for a meal, I settled for dessert and got the creme brulee cheesecake to go. It turned out to be delicious. The slow service and cold (expensive) lamb was that bad that it overshadowed the good. Doubt we'll return.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to try Oak during their first full week open. Went with my family to enjoy a nice night out after a long day. I would say it's one of the better steakhouses in Charlotte!  The ambiance is top notch, we walked in and were greeted kindly and shown to our table quickly. I loved the details of the burned logo into the tables. If you like gin, the negroni for two is one of the best Charlotte has to offer! (and the presentation is great). It's a perfect size for a nice starter or a nice drink if you're ubering it for one.  For starters, we opened with the octopus and the foie gras. Both were outstanding, the octopus was nice and tender, which complemented the richness of the foie gras very well. I feel the foie was one of the better ones I've had in Charlotte, Hudson Valley maybe, though it wasn't acknowledged on the menu.   The burger, mac and cheese and mushrooms were fine, nothing out of this world or to write home about. The one side I would recommend would be the lobster grits... rich and velvety... it paired nicely with the steaks.   Now for the steaks, we got the top-of-the-line aged bone-in ribeye and the NY Strip... very good... but for the price I've had better. The doneness was a little spotty with my medium rare specimen, not sure if it's the method of cooking or instrumentation. I may just had back luck... but for the price, I rightly expected perfection.   The service was head and shoulders above average, the servers were knowledgeable and were eager to please. I was impressed.   Now, I'm not one to have a sweet tooth, but Oak's Cheesecake creme brulee is a must try. I'll leave that one be. I would have it every day if it didn't have any calories. Actually, I would have the entire pie if we're playing that game.   Overall, I need to go again... I just should make sure someone is taking me or I save up a few months. A nice place for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Good, but should have been better. The Decour of the restaurant is beautiful, and the location is perfect right in South Park. Also, all the sides we ordered with our meal were amazing.  But there were a few things that bothered me about our meal. First the service, our server was very nice and professional. I just wish he was a little more tentative to our table. I felt like I was constantly looking for him to order a drink.  Speaking of drinks, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails that the waiter recommended. It was very good just weak.  At $15 a pop, I'd like to taste the booze in my drink.  Now on to the steak. I ordered the bone in aged ribeye medium. The first steak that came out was chard pretty bad and lacked flavor. The manager came over and offered to cook me another one. 20 minutes later a less chard steak came out. The second steak was a lot better and had some good flavor. It was just unfortunate that we were all done eating by the time it came out.  Overall, our dining experience was good just not great. And i feel that when you go to a high end steakhouse house everything should be great.  That's why you pay $15 cocktails and $60 steaks...",

    "text": "So I always knew about the Oak Steakhouse in Charleston and when i heard there was one in Charlotte I had to quickly see if it was on par with Charleston.   Well I can say that it is on par with Charleston's Oak house! The food, atmosphere, service and overall experience is one that leaves me wanting to come back over and over again!   The manager personally comes to every table to not just check up on you but to really help with the dinning experience. He was awesome and even gave us a free appetizer to try out!   We went for restaurant week so it was a True bang for your buck! $35 for three course meal and you can't go wrong here!   I got the filet 8oz med rare and the temperature was literally cooked to perfection!!! The only thing I would change is the seasoning. It was a little bland for my taste but hands down one the best steaks I have ever had because the perfect cooking style.   The cream brulee cheesecake was something else with its rich creamy and succulent taste!   Please run to Oak steakhouse for that special night or just a really nice dinner! You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Went here for a celebration dinner (new job) after a friend recommend, we normally go to a upscale major chain for these kind of things, but thought we'd try it out. Service was ok for the first half of the meal. Appetizer came out as did bread and drinks. Salads followed shortly, but my kids did not get their sodas they had ordered ... Then we waited... For about 15 minutes (at least) for our entrees. Our server was absent during this time.  When the entrees arrived, my son's fries were cold, my steak was cold and one of the sides was cold.  Because we had been waiting so long and were hungry we started eating and thought the server would be by so I could inform him... Nope, had to flag down another server to ask her to find ours.  He came over and I told him about the food temperatures and he sent the manager over, talked to him and the manager did come back with a gift card.  Planned to order dessert because I had seen them online and they looked amazing, but then we all had finished and waited... Again, forks down for a while for our server.  My wife and daughter finally got up and went outside to wait.  Server finally came by, cleared plates and brought the bill.  We were seated at 6:30 and were leaving at 8:30. That is not a long time with multiple courses, drinks, etc. But the timing was off and part of the food was cold. So we went somewhere else for dessert.  Food taste was great, but about the same as the standby chain we normally go to.  We will probably not go back (even with the gift card) based on the experience. AND just realized this morning that they did not include all the leftovers we asked that they box up for us. We will not be back.",

    "text": "Oak Steakhouse gets my 300th review - which is a great one!  We came here at the beginning of the month for a celebration and Oak was my pick based off their menu, great reviews, and wanting to try something new!  There were three of us and we were promptly seated when we arrived.  Had to get an early reservation time though since they were booked for most of the evening!    Service was great from start to finish - it was slow, so be prepared for that, but it is that way on purpose so you can enjoy your meal - you are not rushed out of there.  I am a sweet wine drinker and asked my server for opinions since it didn't look like they had any on their menu.  He confirmed they really didn't have any, but offered me to try his suggestion - it was okay, but not my style.  I ended up going with one of their dessert wines, which is a really small pour (as it should be for a dessert wine), but that was the only disappointment that there wasn't really anything even offered for the sweet tooth drinkers.  Unlike the other steak chains that I have gone to, Oak really does not offer a small steak.  Their smallest ribeye is 16 ounces, which is far too much for one person to order, so it can get pricy if people want different steaks/entrees.  Luckily, all three of us like ribeye and like it cooked the same way, so we ordered one ribeye with a bunch of sides - grilled broccoli, mushrooms, pork belly mac and cheese, and jalapeno cornbread.  We appreciated that Oak actually sliced the ribeye for us so it made it easy for us!  It was fabulous.  My husband prefers Ruth Chris' ribeye, but I thought this was just as great - they are just prepared/cooked very differently (I think he likes all that butter).  All of the sides were fantastic, loved the mac and cheese especially since it was creamy and cheesy - they had the right blend!  We ended the night with dessert - again here is my sweet tooth, so we ordered the creme brulee cheesecake, olive oil lemon cake, and the triple chocolate skillet cookie (takes time to make as it is cooked to order).  All three were fabulous, definitely loved the ooey gooey-ness of the skillet cookie and the creme brulee cheesecake was some of the best cheesecake I have had (I do not like creme brulee either!).  I would go back just for the desserts!  I really think Oak Steakhouse is my new favorite upscale steak restaurant as they were fantastic from start to finish from service to the excellent food.  I'm already dreaming of when we can go back - maybe in October for my birthday!  Just need a giftcard or two since I loved so many dishes - anyone want to send me one?  Highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "So I just may have a new favorite steakhouse in Charlotte.  Probably too soon to say after only one visit but Oak showed out on this night.  From topflight service to top flight food and drink, they got it all right and then some.  We started with a couple cocktails and some raw and Rockefeller oysters moved on to one Bibb and one Oak salad and then came the steaks with roasted broccoli and fried onions as the sides.  Obviously great steaks are the floor for any steakhouse and more on them soon.  For me though, the apps, salads, sides, etc. need to measure up too and all of them did at Oak.    So the steaks... Two of the best we've had anywhere, not just here in the QC and both cooked perfectly.  I'm pretty easy.  Just don't get it past medium rare and I'm good.  My wife likes medium and invariably she gets something a little to a lot under done and she smiles, eats the edges and throws the red stuff my way.  This was perfect medium and she raved on the taste.  I had the Prime NY Strip and was equally pleased with taste and temperature.  Service was all you would expect when dropping that kind of money on a meal.  Speaking of that kind of money... The fact that this part of town can support a Ruth's Chris, Palm, Del Frisco's and now Oak says a lot of about the surrounding coin as these are just the $$$$ steak-centric options and there's plenty of other $$$$ options around.  All that said, glad to have Oak as one of them and based on all the things I still want to try on the menu, I'll be back.",

I ordered the harvest salad, the 8oz filet with blackened butter, and the olive oil cake for dessert. The salad was good, but I tried the butternut squash soup beforehand and wish I would've got hat instead. They also served rolls with honey butter!   I really enjoyed my filet and absolutely loved the blackened butter. It was a perfect combination.   The service was ok, the manager helped the server a lot because it was a busy night. She was the nicest. It took an extremely long time for the dessert to come out, and she explained that the pastry chef was behind in the kitchen.

    "text": "\"Lick the plate clean,\" writes my Yelp buddy Sam R.  She's right (my wife makes my sign a best-to-behave agreement before we dine out so I wouldn't know).  Oak Steakhouse did all the right things, and it was during Restaurant Week.  Ironically, many places blow this golden opportunity to garner new clientelle.  Not here.   Our party of four ordered the Cab Filet Mignon, the catch of the day, and I went for the pork.  The food was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderfully.  Everyone was happy.  My side of three cheese risotto was well balanced and el dente with the pickled vegetables and watercress a refreshing bite of acid cutting through the richness of the entree.  As a bonus they brought us a side of brussel sprouts.  A little sweetness with an Asian flair rounded out the offer.  Delicious.  Our server, Jennifer, was attentive without being pesty.  She handled everything with ease and professionalism.  I like that and happy to tip to a higher level.  I think this place will get your motor running.  So \"give 'em a whirl!\"  You might even lick your plate clean.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of visiting Oak Steakhouse during Restaurant Week in early 2019.   Upon arrival I noticed what a beautiful, open atmosphere Oak offered.  We were seated at a round table in the back of the restaurant, close to the kitchen, which I loved due to the fact I could watch the execution in the kitchen.  Our waitress arrived and offered water and explained a little bit about the Restaurant Week menu and wine they were offering as part of the menu.  After reviewing the menu we decided to start with two bottles of the Red Blend for the table.   Our waitress brought the bottles, corked and allowed one member of our table to taste before moving forward with pouring for everyone.  The menu offered three Appetizer options, 5 Entree options (with 4 upgrades available) and 2 desserts. Among the 5 of us we tried several different things.  I had the Winter Salad to start.  Local greens, toasted almonds, apples, feta with a candied garlic vinaigrette, it was one of the best salads I have had in a long time.  For my entree I chose the 8 oz. Cab Filet Mignon with Whipped Potatoes and Seasonal Greens. The steak was cooked too perfection, with an amazing grilled sear, and everyone else enjoyed their steaks as well.    As for dessert I enjoyed the Lemon Olive Oil Cake, but did taste the Chocolate Cake, heaven.  All I can say it I am happy we chose Oak for Girl's Night Out, and I am looking forward to returning soon.",

Still not knowing the area very well, I used my handy dandy tool Yelp! (Shocker)  We knew we wanted to be in the South Park area so we could walk around the mall post food coma. I found Oak and thought to myself 'this sounds super familiar.' Having been a recent Charleston resident I asked our server Jennifer if there was any relation. Her response was, \"yes, we're all apart of the Indigo Road Restaurant Group.\" ***poooof mind blow**** I got super excited not getting a chance to try Oak in the Holy City, I get to try it in the Queen City now.  This only meant one thing for sure...I had to get steak. My dad and I split a 12 oz. filet which the chef was nice enough to split for us out back. My husband had the burger and my mom had the scallop appetizer. (Scallops & Burger seen in photos)  We decided on three sides (seen in picture Seasonal Vegetables & Crispy Potatoes) - seasonal vegetables, sweet potatoes and the pork belly mac n cheese. As a group we had a hard time between the crispy potatoes which came highly recommended versus the sweet potatoes. Jennifer was amazing and gave us the crispy potatoes complimentary. Between both potato dishes - I personally preferred the sweet potatoes just because I'm not a huge potato person in general.   Now my steak...holy cow (pun intended). That steak was prepared perfectly medium. It was so juicy and tender, I ate the whole thing which is super rare for me. The seasoning gave the filet some great flavor.   As a family we had a fantastic experience at Oak. If you go, ask for Jennifer. Her service was top notch and she has a great personality. Thanks Jennifer for the witty banter and amazing hospitality. We will be back!",

When we dined here it wasn't too crowded, but the acoustics were making it a little hard to hear.  Our servers were all very friendly and made the dining experience pleasant.  We had the grilled octopus and that was the highlight of the meal.  It was cooked perfectly, very meaty and had a nice seasoning.  I would have ordered another plate of that as my entree!  For dinner I had the 8oz steak with some truffle fries.  The steak was cooked perfectly, but didn't have too much flavor.  They offered a whole bunch of sauces to dress it up, but I usually like my filet plain.  Other people in my group seemed to enjoy their entrees ranging from fish to a tomahawk ribeye.  Prices were on par with most nicer steak houses with the medium filet running $40.  Check this place out for a night out, but don't expect a quiet night or a truly top notch steak.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise Oak was. I walked in for an early dinner and was seated right away. My waitress, Emily, was lovely and accomodating and willing to give recommendations.  I started off with a glass of cabernet and two rolls, which were hot from the oven and delicious. Emily informed me that she could do half portions of any of the salads since they are quite large and I was dining by myself. I took her up on that and got the burrata and peach salad which was just divine. Unlike most other restaurant salads, it was not drowning in dressing which I greatly appreciated and the addition of granola was an unusual but good choice.   For my main course I ordered the filet with the blackened butter (also per Emily's recommendation) and the filet was cooked perfectly. The flavor of the blackened butter was milder than I was expecting but still good (it's butter...how could it not be good) but in hindsight I wish I had gone with the horseradish cream instead since I know it's always my favorite. As a side, Emily recommended the mexican street corn and it was fabulous (important to note that it is not at all spicy, which I made sure to ask beforehand because I am not a spice lover). I was sad not to finish it since I wanted to save room for dessert. She also let me know they could do half portions of the sides as well. Even as a half portion, it was still a decent size.   Finally, for dessert I was between two options...the peach cobbler and the lemon olive oil cake. I love me a good cobbler and peaches are everywhere here so I figured it was probably the best thing to get, but something about the lemon olive oil cake was calling me and Emily confirmed that everyone loves it so I went with it and WOW. Simply marvelous. The slice they brought out was the size of my head at least (no half portions on the desserts apparently) and I could only get maybe 1/3 of the way through before I had to throw in the towel. The only downside to it was that they had obviously just taken it out of the fridge so it had that slightly-stiff fridge texture but I took the rest home, left it out overnight and ate it this morning for breakfast (don't judge me, you would do that too) and it was perfect.   The decor was very much a steakhouse feel with wood and leather everywhere but I really love that vibe. They had an outdoor patio as well that looked lovely but it was way too hot for my New England self to be sitting outside. Though I did not need it since I was there obscenely early for dinner, they do offer complementary valet parking.   Overall, I had a lovely experience here and would definitely go back and recommend to anyone in the Charlotte area.",

    "text": "It was restaurant week.. So this was our chance to try a new restaurant. Oak popped up and decided to give this place a try..  Staffs: 5/5 stars. Hostess and our waiter are great..  Food: 3/5 stars. I ordered the 16 oz prime ribeye. There was an additional $15 on top of the $35 set menu. The seasoning of the steak was good..I asked for medium and it came more medium rare. It suppose to come with mashed potatoes and spinach. However, all I had was the steak and a grilled tomato. I didn't realized it suppose to come with that so I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. And I didn't like the Mac and cheese. Plenty of lobsters, however, it tasted very bland. There were no salt on the table to change that. So I didn't finish it. The mashed potato came later and they mentioned that it suppose to be with my steak..  Their butternut squash was good. Very flavorful and have that sweetness.  The winter salad wasn't good. Didn't taste like much and it has a bitter aftertaste   Drinks: I have the lime-lemonade with a shot of gin. Which I like a lot. Had 2 of those.   Overall customer service was great. However, I'll come back to try their regular menu. Wasn't impressive with the restaurant menu.",

    "text": "I really hate that I was unimpressed with Oak. My first (and last) visit was a particularly impactful one because it was on my birthday. And the rating of 3 stars is a generous one considering how quickly my experience descended from enjoyment into one of dissatisfaction. I gave it a shot in no small part due to a wonderful experience at their sushi restaurant O-ku.  When I came in on a Tuesday evening around 6pm I expected that the restaurant would be lightly attended and I could get a table outright. The place looked relatively empty save for a huge party of suits hanging around the bar drinking and mingling waiting for one large table. The hostess, however, said they only had a few high tops - one right beside her and the rest sitting out in the open by the bar - or a seat at the bar. She said it was unusual that they had three large parties that evening (though I only ever saw the one). I decided to sit for a minute and started browsing other restaurants. Finally the hostess came up to me and said \"how about a booth?\" I said that would be great but realized as she led me over to one of the awkwardly large and red semi-circle booths that it felt a bit uncomfortable right in the middle of everything. It seemed like they were making a huge sacrifice to seat one guy at a table meant for four. I even apologized profusely to her and the waiter. I sat in view of the bar, the TV and a very large room for parties beside the bar that I was told would be full.  My waiter was super accommodating and friendly initially. I engaged him with a genuine interest because I am not a steak connoisseur. He guided me through the differences in the steaks, sides, toppings, etc. I settled on a dry-aged 20oz ribeye cooked med-rare (the chef's suggested level according to the waiter) with the scallop Oscar on top. $64 plus $16. Before long an unexpected but free-of-charge baked oysters Rockefeller came out. These things were delectable and I had to confirm that they were a regular item on the menu. After this I started to rethink making a cocktail order and despite preferring a Manhattan usually, I got a Saskatoon by the waiter's suggestion. Meanwhile, bread came out that was nothing at all to praise. Basic rolls with butter. But we came here for the steak didn't we?  My cocktail came out and the steak followed it. The waiter had recommended the Brussels sprouts as a side but I didn't order them for fear of having too much food. Despite that, he brought a side of them out to me at no charge. It was generous and I thanked him. But in the end I didn't like them at all. Something to do with the pickling of the onions on top was off-putting. I let him know my thoughts and in the end I didn't take them home. At the same time I was trying to sip my cocktail but it was too powerful. I know bartenders like to be generous with the alcohol in things but it was too much. The citrus bitters were also overpowering and I had to leave this drink sitting on the table with more than half remaining in the glass. The steak was good but I truly wish I had gone up a level with the doneness and got medium. I'm not usually a rib-eye-guy (filet FTW) but you can quickly tell that these marbled steaks need a little longer on the grill to melt and disperse the fats throughout. By the time I had eaten the more cooked parts around the edge, the steak was getting hard to cut with the knife I had and the drink/Brussels sprouts combination was not sitting well on my stomach. I was ready to get the check and go but the waiter was ghost for a long period of time.  When he finally showed up again I mentioned the check but I made the mistake of asking to review the dessert offerings first. I didn't order anything but let the waiter know I didn't care for the Brussels sprouts or the drink. He even clued me in that it was probably the pickling of the onions - he knew his stuff. The drink, despite being visibly more than half full, was never mentioned. I saw the manager reply to other reviews that Oak \"always\" offers a replacement drink if you're not satisfied. It was never comped and a replacement was never even offered although I thought I gave the waiter plenty opportunity.  As I paid my bill and stood up to leave something hit me hard: the restaurant was still mostly empty save for the one large party from before. The large room across from me never filled. Several small 2 and 4-person tables elsewhere sat empty the entire time. Was I being screwed with? This point was most frustrating because it punctuated the beginning and end of my experience. I felt more like I was in the way with being accommodated rather than an appreciated guest. As I left, the same hostess asked if I enjoyed myself. I replied honestly with \"Eh, it was alright.\" to which she replied with \"Well, have a good evening.\" The highlight? Despite my direct complaints and obvious dissatisfaction with several things, not once did I hear a \"sorry\".",

They told me I can have a seat anywhere at the bar or selected tables reserved for the bar. The restaurant is really nice and upscale, yet it was dark with lots of wood and leather texture which makes the atmosphere more relaxed. I ordered the oak burger and it came with truffle frittes as well as the pork belly mac and cheese. The burger was huge and I loved how they charr the brioche bun to give it a crisp taste. The meat tasted fresh and the flavor was good. Perhaps some specialty sauce would've been great but the burger was traditional style. The mac and cheese was so delicious and it wasn't salty even though it had a generous amount of cubed pork belly. My server was really pleasant and I liked that I was able to walk in with really casual clothes and not be looked upon like some upscale restaurants would do. The manager was really sweet and made sure my friends and I were being attended properly. Will be back!",

I ordered the Salmon that had a perfect caramelizing on top and was super flavorful. Another had steak that was cooked perfect. Dessert was a gluten free chocolate cake that was dense but not too sweet. We didn't request gluten free but our waiter Zach suggested it and glad he did. I would definitely order it again.  And the restaurant decor is very cozy and welcoming. Overall first impression was very good. Great place for a date night and also great for business dinners  Update 4/25/19 This is my second time going to Oak. I took my wife here for our 24th anniversary. I made a note on my reservation that this was our anniversary. From the check in to my table waitress to the manager, they all acknowledged that this was our anniversary. To me that means that they are really interested in each person and reservation that comes to this restaurant. The manager came by two or three times checking on us, our waitress Jennifer was truly outstanding, and the quality of food was even better than my first visit. I think this Oak was probably the best service and attention I have ever had at a restaurant. There's an old saying that you get what you pay for. Oak truly lives up to that statement and even more",

    "text": "So I just made a reservation on Monday, for Tuesday night, for me and my wife to celebrate our 36th wedding anniversary. I was asked while making the reservation if we had been there before and was there anything we were celebrating. I informed the hostess that it was our first time there and yes we were celebrating an anniversary. They gave me a couple of options for a time to book and we then confirmed what we wanted.  We showed up 10 mins in advance of the reservation, which presented no problem to be immediately seated in a round booth that could have seated six people, but was great for just the two of us. Shortly after being seated the floor manager stopped by to welcome us, he wanted to recognize that he knew it was our first time there and he appreciated we chose them to celebrate our anniversary.  Immediately after or server Nina came by to introduce herself to us and also wanted to recognize us for first time there and she knew we were celebrating an anniversary. She brought us some water and asked us for any other drink order to be placed. We ordered a glass of wine for my wife and a martini for me. When Nina came back with our drinks she also had complementary glasses of champagne to toast our anniversary. She asked how many years and then said that's worth having your picture taken, which she then took.  After giving us some time she came back to describe the menu, how they prepare their steaks and offered a couple of specials not on the menu. She mentioned that she really liked the smoked octopus as a starter. I told her that sounded very good but I had decided on the oyster Rockefeller, my wife got the bib salad. When the appetizers showed up the manager stated they had added the smoked octopus on the house so we could try it. Since my wife does not like dishes like this I enjoyed it by myself, it was excellent, along with the oysters.  We both had the 8oz filet, with sides of roasted asparagus and Crispy potatoes. I chose the scallop Oscar for the top of my steak. The food was outstanding and Nina stopped a couple of times to check on, pour us more water, or get a glass of wine. We were never rushed and enjoyed a fantastic meal with great service.  So we informed Nina we had zero room for dessert and could she bring us the check. She asked if any of the desserts had caught our eye, and my wife talked about two she said if she had eaten less she might have split with me. So a little while later Nina shows up with a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary and stated she would bring a to-go box.  We have eaten at a number of high end steak houses all over the US and abroad. This experience was a five star experience for us and I would highly recommend it.",

The way the booths are set up allows you to be able to have a private conversation and not hear everything your neighbors are saying. We had the Oysters Rockefeller and steak tartar for apps, both of which were good. For our main course we ordered the 90 dry aged ribeye and the mixed grille. The ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare but was on the salty side. So if your thinking about ordering this you may want to tell them to hold the sea salt flakes they add at the end. Everything on the mixed grill was cooked and seasoned well, and we enjoyed he variety of meats/cuts. Overall, all of the food was good and it's pretty much exactly what you would expect from a nice steak house.",

The octopus appetizer was the best I have ever had (including Italy!), and the porterhouse and truffle fries were divine.  Their other restaurant, O-Ku, is a favorite, as well; Oak is a welcome addition to the Southpark restaurant dining scene.  I'm looking forward to returning, AND to their addition soon of a Sunday brunch!",

We had a party of 8 for NYE... the decor and ambience were inviting. Our service was fine but nothing to get excited about; empty glasses were left on our table throughout the meal... water was refilled sparingly. I asked for my steak to be rare; it was brought out medium well.  If I am paying 60+ for a steak, it should be cooked properly. It was replaced awhile later.  No apologies, no warm sides, etc. Instead, I found myself eating while the others were close to done.  I would much rather head to BLT, Bentley's, or one of the many other steakhouses in CLT.  Disappointing.",

In fact the parking situation is very dicey as there is rarely any parking available for the restaurant. Ordered our drinks and then ordered a bottle of wine and our food. The food came and an additional glass of wine was ordered but after five minutes the waiter had to be reminded that the glass of wine had not arrived.  A pasta dish that was ordered was not available but we were not told that until just prior to the entrees being served so there was only time to take their substitute entree of another pasta rather then decide on another dish if we had been told about the pasta not being available soon after the order.  The wine list is pretty inclusive. The prices are the same as at Capital Grill but the service does not equal that at Capital grill.  If your reservations are for a  rainy night I suggest you cancel so you stay dry.",

    "text": "Had dinner here tonight, it was a great experience and delicious. The waitstaff were awesome, humorous and more than able to put up with our table after we'd had a few cocktails. We had the tuna tartare lettuce cups, the carpaccio, and the oysters Rockefeller. My only gripe was that the oysters mainly tasted of bacon and breadcrumbs, no oyster texture or flavor. Three of us had the filet, one the half rack of lamb, and we shared some Truffle fries and Brussel sprouts. The meat was cooked perfectly, the flame grill really does make a difference, the sauces that came with the meats were all also tasty. The Brussels weren't a hit for us, they came in a really aggressive oil and spice mixture that was kind of off putting. The truffle fries serving was HUGE and tasty. For dessert we got the ice cream sandwich (on the house) and the crime brulee cheesecake, the ice cream sandwich was a little weird because the cookies were super hard and difficult to eat. The cheesecake however was soooooooo good. The majority of the meal Was delicious, the service was excellent, if at times a little too excellent---a runner or waiter asked if we wanted more bread at least 4-5 times. $500 for 4 people is a little steep--the above food,  a few cocktails, a bottle of red wine and tip--especially in South Charlotte. But hey, sometimes quality is worth the price and I'd say at Oak that holds True.",

We arrived five minutes past our reservation, but weren't seated for another fifteen minutes (understandable for a holiday), however the big problem for me was that we were first seated at a hightop table no more than 8 feet from the host station, practically in the lobby. We asked to be moved and were moved to the next table over, but at least it wasn't a high top table.  Our waitress was wonderful! Very pleasant, very kind, and full of recommendations about the menu. She absolutely gets a 5 star, the rest of the experience, not so much.   We ordered drinks, we were really excited for the bar menu. My wife ordered a Carolina Summer and I ordered a Saskatoon. My wife's drink tasted like a unsweetened La Croix water and mine tasted like a concoction of essential oils with a little bit of alcohol. I was very surprised that, for the price ($15+) the bar was so light on their pours. I would not recommend ordering drinks here.   We ordered a salad to start, which was plenty large enough to share. Two steaks, a side of frites, and the grilled broccoli. The steaks were very good, almost great! The sides were par, especially the frites which were essentially your average fries with a little too much salt and garlic on top. The broccoli was good, and again, almost great.   I think this restaurant is close to being really good, but until they become more liberal with their alcohol pours and can boost the quality of their sides, I think it is an overpriced step-up from an Outback, etc. We ended our night by going to Firebirds in Ballantyne for some after-dinner drinks and honestly, probably will go straight to Firebirds next time.",

    "text": "We were a party of five here for my birthday. Overall the welcome and getting seated was fine. The front staff seemed a little distracted or maybe startled when we arrived, but were kind enough. We were offered to be seated while we wait for the rest of our party who was parking. To be honest, after reading the reviews and knowing this restaurant group, I was expecting a bit of fun. I would describe it as more somber than anything. But our server did well with asking if everything tasted good.   We ordered some drinks to get started. While $16 can seem a little steep for a cocktail (and yes, I know this is a nicer restaurant, I'm just tired of the $15 to $16 cocktail), our drinks were really tasty and seemed to have been made with skill and attention. Side note, the bar area is beautiful and the Oak Manhattan is exceptional.   We each ordered burrata salad, one person in our party got the vegetable soup, though they didn't actually order it and had just asked the server what the soup of the day is. To be fair, the person who asked what the soup of the day was had mostly lost their voice a little so it wasn't a big deal. The burrata though--I could eat the burrata salad every day of my life! It was so good!   For the main course everyone except me ordered the filet and I got the 16 oz. ribeye. We also ordered several sides. For sides we got the pork belly mac n cheese, the assorted mushrooms, collard greens, and truffle frites. None of the sides were bad, none unfortunately none of them were all that memorable either. About half our table wasn't big on the dry, hard, chunks of pork belly in the mac. I personally thought it was delicious. My steak came out medium, but I had ordered it medium rare. I did expect a perfect cook here for a $54 steak. This was not a huge deal and I didn't want them to throw it away as waste, so I didn't mention it to the server. I know they would have recooked it if I mentioned it. Our server was kind and very friendly. There were maybe two times when we needed something and waited a little while. Over all a great addition to the South Park restaurant scene and well worth a visit.",

The booth request seemed to throw hostess a little. Menu was pretty straight forward for steakhouse. The prices lead me to think they are wanting to grab some of Del Fiscos and RC customers. I had the pork chop which was very tasty and the risotto was great. The mixed vegetables that came with it were terrible. I would suggest some steamed broccoli for a choice. Wife had the filet and I did taste it and it was ok. We also got the whipped potatoes and the sauteed vegetables. The potatoes tasted like they were from a box and were very dry. The sauteed vegetables were just ok. We also started the meal with the cheese board and while a few of the items were pretty good (meats mainly), the 2, yes 2 cheeses were just ok. There also should have been some cranberries. The main reason I said the cheeses were just ok was because the center portion of both cheeses were softer, by the time we started making it to the outer portion, it was to hard to cut. I had the Caesar salad which was very good. I will always give a place a second shot to redeem a mediocre first time but we dropped over $200 here without buying a bottle of wine and if I'm going to do that, the entire meal better be more than just ok. I leave these reviews for 2 reasons. One that they management reads them and makes some changes and 2 so that others have something to compare when they do take the time to review.",

    "text": "I was very excited to eat at this restaurant because it has a great reputation in other cities . We were a big group so we sampled much of the menu. The steaks were okay but the sides were awful ( very salty !). We spoke with the manager and gave him our feedback. Normally most restaurants would offer some sort of compensation ( free dessert / take the sides off the bill) , however this manager interaction was very awkward - he barely spoke with us, but did not apologize and walked away. Very disappointed. Will not be going back . If you want a good steak house check out BLT or STK.",

    "text": "Loved this restaurant. The decor was really upscale but still comfortable and the service was spectacular. As a vegetarian who occasionally eats fish, there aren't usually a ton of options for me on a steakhouse menu but I had some tough choices to make last night. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend the scallops, crabcakes, and the cheesecake. Oh man, that cheesecake... Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Just wrapped up our first visit, and we're walking away full, happy and bursting with praise for this place. Driving by crowds at other South Park spots I want to yell - get your butts to Oak for brunch. I'm a picky person about service and the people of Oak are amazing! Decor and music - on point! We started off with a french press of Pure Intentions, along with chocolate chip banana bread and cinnamon rolls. Both were delicious but the bread was my favorite due to the combination of ooey gooey chocolate and the crisp but not burnt bottom. My fiance ordered the skillet for her main - the homemade sausage and gravy were a hit! My lobster frittata didn't disappoint - they didn't skimp on the lobster and I loved the touch of lemon on the micro greens. Our server Sam surprised us with chocolate cake to go for my fiance's birthday- such a sweet gesture! Definitely coming back for dinner soon!",

This time my experience was the exact opposite; full disclosure, this time I ate here for an industry presentation in the restaurant's conference room on someone else's dime. An hour and a half into the conference (the presentation had actually already concluded by then) we still hadnt been served our main courses, so I had asked for everything to go 30 minutes prior (1 hour in) to 2 different servers 15 minutes apart; nothing was done. I didn't want to make a scene, but I left the restaurant hungry, disappointed and never even saw or tasted my main course after having been at the restaurant for more than 90 minutes.",

The experience and hospitality everyone gave us was a 10/10 I order the filet mignon, and my boyfriend order the recommended bone in aged steak. I ate more of his than I did mines. No A1 sauce needed, salt or pepper. Medium rare to the perfection. Sides were tasteful and the jalapeno corn bread is still in my fridge bc we had so much food and I didnt want waste it. Lol Their drinks came out perfect, the manager came by to thank us for coming there for our special day and gave us a glass each of champagne, which we did not expect. They made us feel welcome, appreciated and spoiled. I didnt mind which plate came out first but Aaron made sure to course us, everything came out perfect. We enjoyed it very much and will be back for those yummy steaks!",

    "text": "Pros: Sophisticated, intimate, warm, delicious.  On May 8th, I attended one of Oak's VIP open nights. My friends and I arrived just before our 8:15pm reservation and we were immediately and warmly greeted by friendly faces at the host stand. We were then promptly led to a beautiful and comfortable booth where we received excellent service. Every single staff member we interacted with was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, and welcoming. The food was truly unbelievable and I had- without a doubt- one of the best steaks of my life. The ribeye was cooked to perfection and exactly the way I ordered it. Oak is currently awaiting their liquor license, but the wine list was impressive and the sake/wine based cocktails that were being offered that night were wonderfully executed.  There are always a few kinks to be worked out when any new business/restaurant opens but any slip ups made by Oak staff were minor and easily corrected or went unnoticed altogether. There really is no end to the positive things I can say about Oak. The decor is elegant and stylish without any air of pretentiousness, the staff is at the top of their game and very well versed in everything Oak has to offer, and the food is beyond compare. Every single person involved with Oak has clearly worked immensely hard and they are ready to be the best steakhouse in Charlotte. I am already eagerly anticipating my next meal there. You should too.",

A good steak does not need excessive seasoning or be drowning in butter. Sides were exceptional, especially the brussel sprouts. Even if you don't like brussel sprouts, you might love these! Service was excellent and very attentive.",

We sat at the bar and ordered four items to share and only one I would order again.  We started with the meat and cheese plate.  It was fine, I didn't love the meats but that could just be my preference. We also ordered the filet with truffle fries on the bar bites menu (specials before 6:30.)  It was a great steak, cooked perfectly and the fries were to die for.  It was also a great value at $18 for a five ounce steak.  We also had half of an oak salad which was fine but over dressed.  The grilled octopus was super tender but also super salty.    The wine list and by the glass list could use some work.  The service from the female bartender was awesome.  She was very attentive and she comped us for a bottle of wine that we drank half of and just couldn't get past the weird flavor of the wine.  I would come back for a cocktail and those amazing fries!",
