    "text": "Brixx is a Charlotte-based pizza chain but it's not your typical pizza joint.  This is a place with creative pizza toppings and the pies are cooked in a brick oven (hence the name Brixx, i presume).  It's been a while since I've been in this location of Brixx but it is my favorite even though there are two others that are closer to me.  This location is in the first floor of the 7th Street Station Parking Garage.  I remember this location to be a little brighter inside but it was not this time around.  I guess I need to get here more often to see the changes.  In fact it was rather dark that it was difficult to read menus even with the small light against the wall of the booth.  One good thing I will give Brixx is they have a decent selection of local beers of draft (OMB, Four Friends, Birdsong and NoDa were all represented).    As for food, well I felt jipped with my Caribbean Shrimp Pizza.  There was all this dough and not much in toppings.  I personally prefer my pizzas loaded with toppings.  But 5 shrimp really didn't make this worth the bread.  And service was odd here.  There were times that our server was constantly checking on us which was bit annoying because it didn't give you a chance to enjoy anything and then things slacked off where you didn't hear from her.  And it seemed like extra effort to ask if we wanted separate checks.  But at least she split them up corrected after we finally asked.  I'd come here for the beer more than the pizza.  For Pizza, I'll stick to the local Italian places where I know I can get a loaded pie without having to ask and pay extra for it.",

We order the bread sticks which where freshly baked and delicious and the Hawaiian pizza. Both my boyfriend and I agreed that it tasted amazing, the portions aren't that big but the prize is also not bad so can't complain. We are definitely thinking of stopping by again soon.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends before going to the Checkers game, a group of 6 people. We were sat in a booth that was a little cramped, but the place was busy so we didn't mind.   Being an after work event, our group got there in 3 waves. From the time we sat down until the last person got there was probably 10 minutes. The waitress was so impatient. As soon as the last person sat down she came over and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat. Well... yes some of us that had been there knew, but the one who just sat down (my husband) had not even had the chance to look at the menu.   From there it only went downhill. I got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice. She didn't come back to the table after that for 20 minutes. I got the Fresh House Made Mozzarella Sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich. It sounded so good, but the ingredients were wimpy. There wasn't enough tomato (which were not ripe) to cover the bread, and there were maybe 2 shreds of onion. There was nothing fresh about it.   I also ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (not on the menu) which I had to ask if there were any ciders. The waitress did not say the price but beware they are $5.75. Too expensive in my mind for that drink (but what could I do at that point?).   The location is convenient, but I would much rather go to Queen City Q.",

    "text": "I wavered between two and three stars.  I think truthfully this is a 2.5 star place.   Nothing totally objectionable or inedible, but just not my bag.  I've been to Brixx up in Birkdale and I remember liking my salad.  I was brand new to the area and my Realtor took me there one day after looking at apartments.  Maybe I was too focused on apartment hunting to remember it clearly, but I remember liking my salad from Birkdale.  I've eaten at the uptown place twice.  Both on Saturday nights while partaking in the free trivia they offer.  Four stars for trivia, but I digress.  The first time I had a salad and bread sticks.  The bread sticks were weird.  Not a fan and I love anything vaguely resembling dough!  The salad was unremarkable.  Not good, not bad, just kinda average.  I've had better salads at Panera.  Anywho, I tried a pizza the 2nd time.  Again it was just meh, I've had some frozen pizzas that were better.  But in the same vein I've had way worse experiences.      Will I return to Brixx in uptown....sure, I love me some trivia.  But I may just drink (responsibly of course!)....don't know that I'll try the food b/c it just doesn't blow me away and both times I came away sightly disappointed.  Shout out to my server from the last time - wish I could remember her name.  Well, Brixx validates parking and somehow I lost my ticket. I went back to the garage and attempted to pull a ticket on foot, but damn garage ticket dispensers are smart.  They won't dispense a ticket w/o sensing a car is present.  Anyway I asked my server what Brixx could do b/c I was genuinely afraid of how I'd get my car out past the gates. My server gave me her ticket, validated and everything.  That was beyond.  Maybe she was conning me to get a bigger tip, but I don't care...I made sure she was taken care of.  I think my bill was $13 or so for my pizza, but I tipped her an extra $5.  She was the bomb.  ETA - Ok I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 b/c my server was awesome.  She went above and beyond.  It appears as if management reads these reviews so I really wish I remembered her name b/c she deserves kudos.  Maybe they'll figure it out/remember me (it was the night of the big Bruce Springsteen concert across the street at Time Warner).  If not, well all I can say is the service is always great and for that I'll fondly remember Brixx in uptown.",

We had two pizzas - a classic (it was fine) and a new-age (Buffalo chicken).  The problems: crust had zero flavor, the ingredients covered MAYBE 30% of the surface and maybe that was a good thing because they too lacked any real flavor.  And then there was the service - incredible slow with lots of excuses (sorry - the bar got really crazy....and there was nothing crazy about it).  The only thing good was the above par beer list which we were forced to wait FOREVER to get our beer.  Bizarre.  DON\"T GO HERE!",

I go in, order my always delicious Bronx Bomber pizza, eat & am on my way. Maybe the staff is trained in knowing who's in a hurry vs. those that have no where to be.  My pizza always comes out perfect. The thin crust is never burnt, toppings are plentiful & well distributed. The sauce is light, which is extremely important to me.  Yes, it's crowded & thankfully has a mix of people between the downtown workers, sports fans, families, couples, or groups.  Service is quick & friendly.",

I had a chicken salad and they barely put any dressing on it at all and the chicken was dry and chewy.  My wife's cheese pizza was like wet cardboard.  I think they were rushing out orders and just didn't fire the pizza long enough. We had better pizza at my high school back in Michigan.  The breadsticks were probably the best thing we ate and my sons pasta/Alfredo was pretty decent.  All in all, I've found better things to spend $43 on.",

They said \"$2 domestics\" which nomally means Bud, Bud Light, etc but not  here - almost every beer made in the USA (except for a couple of high gravity ones) were $2.  This includes OMB, Skull Coast, Four Friends, Highland Gaelic, etc.  Tuesday all Charlotte beers are $2.50, and Sunday all NC beers are $2.50 (plus wine is 1/2 price bottles).  The service has been very good too.  So 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for the beer and service.",

They cook in a wood oven, and it seems to make the pizza taste that much better!  My favorite specialty pizzas are:  - The Bronx Bomber: traditional red tomato base pizza with sausages & prosiutto (This is probably my favorite and will keep getting this one)  - Hawaiian: pizza with pineapples & prosciutto  - 4x4: four cheeses & four meats (very filling if you are hungry)  As for anything else like sandwiches or salads I have not really tired, but if you do decide to come here you have to try the pizza at least once!  On a side note they have a great selection of beers on draft for any beer fanatics.    For all the times I have been here I have not had any trouble with seating or the timeliness/attentiveness of their wait staff.  I will definitely be back here sometime in the near future! ENJOY!",

    "text": "There had been approximately a four year hiatus between my visits to Brixx. Despite the extended time between visits, i always considered it a 3-star establishment. However, i've changed quite a bit over this time and upon my return to Brixx, i found they have always had what i never knew i would someday want. For one, they have a solid beer selection. i've always drank beer and they always have some beer on special for $3 (New Castle last time in)  which used to be all i require. Nowadays i'm a little craftier than i used to be and they satisfy with a good selection of local beers along with some nationwide favorites. Also, $1.95 domestic drafts on Monday.  The other great thing about Brixx is the fact that they offer Vegan cheese. After trying vegan pizza one time at Mellow Mushroom, i was kind of turned off. Fortunately i tried again because i think i've had it probably 5 times in the past month. Love it here. We've done the wood-roasted vegetable and a modified Mexican and will order both again. With the wood-roasted vegetable, i like to get a side of marinara for some crust dipping action. This might be why they don't get 5 stars. i don't think i've had a server remember to bring my side of marinara. Not a huge deal, but every time?   i also recommend the hummus plate as a starter. Their black bean hummus is really good.    You can park in the 7th street garage and they will validate at the hostess stand, so no need to fret about finding parking.   Apparently vegan options and good beer is all i need in life these days.",

The place wasn't too busy and we were greeted with the good news that they offer $3 mimosas!   The mimosas were good. But that's where the good stops...unfortunately.   Yeah, the prices were reasonable but I just wasn't a fan of the food. And for me I'd rather pay more to get better tasting food.   I ordered the Americo pizza which comes with pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. I didn't like the crust, or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm. Ugh.   No thank you Brixx...I'll stick to other pizza joints to satisfy my pizza needs.",

We have been here a few times each summer when we visit and have always found it comfortable with very little wait, if any. The food was very good. We each got a pizza. For those with gluten allergies like my wife, the handmade crust was very tasty with good texture on the crust which is hard to do. We were sad to hear the music trivia went away on Fridays but those are the times. Still, I recommend this place... Prices are reasonable, staff if well trained and courteous, and it's close to the convention center and the train/tram. Be sure to sign up for the mailing list, the coupons are a good deal.",

I'd recommend doing a half and half pizza, that way you get to try 2 kinds. The best part is there is no upcharge. They have BOGO on pizzas in local magazines so that's the way to go. Excellent patio to sit our on at night!",

What I really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables!

    "text": "Pizza and beer is one of the great food combinations of all time and that's why you stop in here.  My always amazing Yelp Mobile App zeroed me in on these folks.  Thanks Charlotte Yelpers!  So I walked in the door and scanned the modern decor.  I don't mind modern decor when it matches the food but to me, pizza and beer is a rustic kind of meal.  I know it's a personal preference but I would have liked a different atmosphere.  Next came the beer list and the one word I would use to describe it is decent.  There was something for everybody here but nothing really exotic to excite the True beer aficionado. You can expect almost thirty drafts.   I was mildly annoyed that their list does not include ABVs.  They should add this sooner rather than later as it's become standard at good craft beer joints.  Next I perused the pizza menu and choose the BRONX BOMBER for $10.95. It included spicy Italian sausage, prosciutto, gorgonzola cheese, tomato sauce and fresh oregano.  I ordered it because the carnivore in me was roaring and this is as close as I could get to a meat lovers pie.  They should consider adding one to the menu.  It was out quickly and I have to say I was impressed.  The amount of toppings was appropriate.  It was not greasy and that's a very good thing. For me, one thing that's True of a great pizza is that you can taste both the crust and the toppings.  That was True here and the delicious taste of a little char on the crust came through.  The size of the pie is worth noting.  It will definitely fill up one person but is probably a little small for two. Overall this was a very good pie.  Throughout my meal customer service was just fine.  These folks get a solid three stars from me and if I could I would go for three and a half.",

The price range is moderate, with most items around 10 dollars. This is great if you are looking to get pizza, but not great if you plan on eating a sandwich. Service was great he entire time. They managed to keep a 30 person party happy and refilled over the course of an hour. The food was good. Brixx is known for their wood/fired pizza, and it is clear why. Their crust was cooked to perfection and the sauce and toppings were wonderfully complementary. The sandwiches were not as great. I found the chicken to be very dry and tough on the chicken club. The atmosphere is that of a restaurant-bar. There are some questionable restaurant features, but all in all it is a nicely decorated restaurant. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for pizza for dinner or a heavy lunch.",

There aren't a lot of places that will cook a good vegan pizza, but they defiantly know what they are doing.   The crust was thin, crispy, and flavorful.

Casey Offerman is the catering manager... today, I called him at 12:30 for enough pizza to feed lunch to the 40 people in my office... I ordered 24 pizzas and salad for all... They arrived here within 30 minutes with hot pizza, cold salad, napkins, plates, and smiles!  AMAZINGLY fast and reliable service.

    "text": "Good Pizza...BAD SERVICE... If You're African American  I have been a fan of Brixx for years and have visited numerous locations and never had bad service until last night.  A friend of mine and I ventured to the uptown location and were treated like second class citizens the entire night.  It wasn't particularly busy due to the inclement weather so I thought it was odd that it took nearly 15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge my presence and take my drink order or bring menus to the table.  She never gave her name or smiled and for the entire meal experience, my date had to keep flagging her down.    She hardly checked on us during the meal (our empty dirty plates smiled at her from the table), my beverage glasses became empty and remained that way until we flagged her down and asked for refills, it was awful.  It was then that I noticed that we were the only patrons of color in the entire restaurant.  I have never had the \"race\" experience in Charlotte, so this was shocking.  I was determined NOT to look at the situation that way, but it was soon VERY evident that our Caucasian counterparts were getting stellar service, and we were not.  This all culminated when she brought us the check (which we had to ask for) that she literally tossed across the table.  I was mortified.  Newsflash:  I am an EXTREMELY successful business woman who worked her way through college as a waitress.  I have left tips that were more than the price of the meal in pizza joints just because the service was amazing and I wanted to help out an up and coming young person.  Casual dining should not equal sub par service, and if you have problem with BLACK people, you should work somewhere else.  This experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I will never visit this place again.  I have made it a point to tell my friends not to go there during the upcoming CIAA weekend.  Boycott!",

And it was pretty decent... even for this Chicago pizza loving girl.   Their zza is more flatbread style, which is great because you feel like you can eat a lot more. Bonus points for having a whole wheat crust option! I tried seven or eight varieties, and recommend their quattro formaggio and mushroom and arugula.  For those who like traditional margherita pizza, do not order the one here. You will be disappointed as it is basically a cheese pizza with tomato and basil.   While Brixx is a pizza and beer place, they also have delicious appetizers. I swear I could eat a whole order of their gorgonzola blue potato chips by myself. Yes. Please.   But the real winner here is their desserts. The pumpkin tiramisu and chocolate mousse cakes were fantastic.  Prices are super reasonable.",

    "text": "Brixx has some great selections if you know what to order. Their sandwiches can be so-so although I've ordered my fair share and my first week in Charlotte they were a major comfort (Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich). Their salads are pretty nice but their pizza- yum! I've tried all the veggie oriented varieties except the Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza which is next on my list. The location is perfect for when you're wandering uptown, maybe perusing the library, and hunger suddenly strikes. If you're looking for a cheap slice, you may want to go to Fuel, but if you're looking for something more enjoyable, try Brixx.   One drawback to Brixx... there is smoking inside, at least the last time I was at this location which has been awhile.",

I had the  Wild Mushroom that is described as having 3 kinds of mushrooms, an olive oil base, mozzarella, shaved parm and arugula.   I first noticed that the crust lacked flavor and texture. Come on, these are what high temperature ovens are all about. The mushrooms were not \"wild\" at all. They too lacked flavor and the shiitake, portobello and buttons were indistinguishable between each other. The olive oil base was non existent, so it was one dry pie. However, the arugula was fresh and plentiful! (Stop the world!)(eye roll)  My guess is that this joint gets their ingredients on the cheap and is all about the bottom line and couldn't care less about food quality.  What an epic flop of a meal.",

When I order a salad, I like a big variety of ingredients, otherwise it's just something I could make at home, so what's the point ... ya know? This salad only had chicken, goat cheese, roasted red peppers & pistachios (random, but delicious nonetheless). Needless to say, when the food came, I wished I had listened to myself. The ingredients had a good flavor, and their was plenty of chicken in it, but it was just such a boring salad. Usually you get carrots, cabbage, onion ... tons of stuff in a thai salad.  This wouldn't be my first choice by any means.  Service was about average, nothing exceptional going on in that department. Their pizza is 100000x better than a salad, so I'd definitely go with the extra calories on this one.",

I was expecting the Carribbean Jerk to be similar to the one at CPK or similar to the Maui Wowie at Mellow Mushroom. It's not very good compared to either of those places, but the crust on the pizza was good. Overall taste was not great. My friend said there was chunks of garlic in his and it would've been better if it was pressed garlic. Service was quick and the waiter was very tentative.

Luckily, our party of two was seated quickly.  We weren't that hungry so we decided to share an app and a pizza.  We started with the Pimento Cheese and Pita Chips.  It doesn't happen often, but there was a perfect quantity of dip to chips ratio.  Nice work, Brixx.  The Pimento cheese was good, not great.  We shared the 4X4 pizza that has four cheese and four meats.  The pizza here has a thin crust and was a nice size for two people to split.  I didn't really taste the goat cheese or the gouda that were supposed to be on the pizza but the flavors may have been overwhelmed by the meats.  Service was good and efficient.  I'd been to a Brixx before and this visit met my expectations.  The main reason we avoided Fuel pizza is because it didn't sell alcohol.",

I took forever just to get the bartender's attention just to pick up my pizzas. It took about 10 minutes just to pick up food. At home, I was upset to find this Brixx location had messed up my order. I received a veggie pizza? ( broccoli and other random veggies), I'm not sure how they got \"veggie\" from \"Mexican\" over the phone. It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't what I ordered and was sad as the Mexican is my all time fav from Brixx. The Jerk Chicken pizza was good but it looked very sloppy, the toppings were uneven and splattered all over the pizza dough. These pizzas were clearly not made with love.

We chose this eatery as a second choice after our first choice (Queen City Q) was seen to be overrun with drunken St. Patty's Day revelers. (The parade was a day late). Brixx was not overcrowded, and thus a winner in that regard.   I'll examine the good first. We were seated quickly, and our drink order was also taken fairly quickly. The food was really good as well; there's something about wood-fired pizza that is beyond compare to other pizzas. And with a coupon from their mobile app, the food was reasonably priced.   Now, the term \"starter\" is defined as a small course eaten before the main course. So when I ordered their Brixx Stixx as a starter, I kind of expected it before the pizzas. Maybe that was my mistake, expecting an appetizer before the main course; silly me. And 25 minutes isn't too long to wait for the main course, unless, of course, you're hungry and want a \"starter\" first.   Our server was obviously busy, so it's likely for this reason that she forgot our request for lemons for our water. It's OK, we re-requested them 20 minutes later from someone else and got them.   But is her busyness to blame for not asking - even once - how the food is, or if we need anything else after it was served? She didn't speak to us again until dropping the check off. I don't think that a $3 tip (a little over 10% of the pre-discounted check price) was out of line here.    Overall: good food, meh service, probably won't come back again.",

The crust was chewy and not tough but the toppings were bland and I didn't see a wild mushroom anywhere on the plate (just white button). The server charged us for the wrong check. 24 hours later both charges are still on my Amex.  Just an average lunch stop.",

The host walked up after I stood there for a few minutes and said, \"Something wrong?\" then when I said no he sat us. The waitress was emotionless and when I said my order was going to be a little complicated (light-heartedly), she just stared at me and waited. Then she got it wrong.   When I made a comment about the order she gave me a plate to \"pick it off\" and went and told her coworker about it who the stared at me and laughed.  It was also so dirty. Like it'd never been vacuumed.   Maybe it's management, maybe it was something in the water. But it was a Saturday evening with one other table besides us in UPTOWN. that says enough in itself.

I would say that the service here was lacking, which shouldn't happen at such an event or any other time.  I waited quite a bit for a server to come over and take my order, we received no silverware or napkins, just basic things that were a bad look.  I ended up ordering a kid's pizza for my son and I ordered the Rustica pizza(prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke, olives, and roasted garlic) which was excellent and I would order that again if I decide to go back.

To be fair, I will preface my review with I work for CMS and there were two schools worth of staff coming for lunch.   With that being said, they knew we were coming in advance, and we're a bit unorganized and chaotic. Our table got decent service, but some of our tables didn't get served at all and ended up leaving. We also had a vegetarian at our table and it took about 30 minutes for them to bring us a pizza with no meat.   The food is okay here, there were a lot of slices with no toppings on them, just crust. The salads were lettuce and a sprinkle of cheese with only two dressings offered. The flavor was good on the pies that actually had toppings on them.   The two servers that were assigned to us did a great job, seeing as there were so many of us and very few of them. The manager came out to help at the very end, but they did what they could. Thank you for serving our big group.",

I don't know for sure but I think they had filled their makers mark bottle with a cheaper whiskey... again, I don't have proof but I've had makers more times than I can remember and this one tasted different in a bad way. If you're in uptown Charlotte, it's late and you don't want bar food check this place out.

Our server was in training, he was friendly and personable.  My husband and I both got the lunch special (half a pizza and half a salad for $8.95). It was the perfect amount of food and allowed us to both get exactly what we wanted on our pizzas and salad. Our son choose the kids pasta with butter.          Our food took longer than expected to come out and unfortunately our pizzas came out cold. We informed our server and he had new ones made for us. By the time our new ones came out, our son was almost done eating his pasta and was ready to leave the restaurant.  The next ones came out hot. The remade pizzas were decent, but not great...they didn't want me to rush back to the restaurant to order another pizza.  I thought the crust was okay, the sauce was a little sweet for my liking and toppings were on the light side.  Overall it wasn't a bad lunch, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice next time I'm uptown and want pizza.",

All we knew was that we wanted something fast. Brixx happened to be the first restaurant we encountered on our walk so we went inside. We got the Korean meatballs, Bourbon pizza, and an alfredo dish. Korean meatballs tasted like normal meatballs with a sweet asian sauce poured on top and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was alright. The pizza was not to my liking. Much too sweet so I only had a bite of that. The alfredo left much to be desired. It didn't have any flavor, which I didn't mind. I was taking one of my board exams the next day and didn't want anything that would upset my stomach, so bland was good for me. The server who served us wasn't super friendly, but she wasn't rude either. Overall I would say the main draw is the restaurant's aesthetics. Cute lighting outside and spacious interior. Unfortunately I was expecting a little more from my first meal in North Carolina.....",

There pizzas are meant to be personalized sized, but they are pretty big! Well worth the $10. The pizza is made from a brick oven so it came out super fast. The crust was light and crispy- cooked perfectly.   We both ordered pizza and we were able to split pizzas half n half so we eventually were able to try 4 different flavors! Btw they have about 20 Pizza options for you to pick from. Here were our choices:   Pear and Gorgonzola: very unique. I liked this pizza, but would never order a full pizza of it. The nuts on the pizza kinda threw me off however, If you like something different I would recommend this.   Rosemary chicken: very refreshing with the Rosemary. The pizza also included mushrooms and onions.   Meatball: oh my! The meatballs were awesome!   Jerk chicken: this was my favorite flavor. It was spicy, but the pineapple on the pizza counteracted it. I would order this pizza again!    Overall we had a good experience at Brixx and I would go there again. I love the variety of pizzas they have, plus they offer salads and sandwiches too!",

I enjoyed the supreme with broccoli, onions, mushrooms, tomato sauce and cheese that was hand-crafted perfectly with a thin crust that allowed me to taste every part of my pizza. Though we had a reservation, the friendly staff did not seem stressed over the size of our group, which included at least 100 children and staff members, but we were served promptly. I will visit them again on my next trip to Charlotte N.C.",

    "text": "I have always enjoyed eating Brixx Pizza, ever since my wife introduced me to them in the Southpark area of several years ago. This location uptown stands up to the great reputation. I had a very attentive server named Jenny, she was nice and made sure to take care of me. I got the special for the day which was a Meaty Man Pizza, it was really tasty and right up my alley. It had pepperoni, sausage, another meat I think and banana peppers, really good combo. For dessert Jenny recommended the Chocolate Truffle Torte which was the perfect balance to the salty pizza I ate. It was rich and decadent with chocolate and caramel drizzle, really was a great combo. I also got a Bell's Amber beer on draft which hit the spot. FYI, on Monday's all the drafts are $2.50, so that is pretty awesome. Great dinner with drink and tip under $25. A win in my book, highly recommend if you are in the uptown area and want some great pizza, good service and nice atmosphere.",

We sat ourselves down and got stared at for a bit until being spoken to .   (At this point, I've expressed to my girlfriend that this restaurant seems very unmotivated and the energy was not there. The people who work there seem lazy and has no professionalism.)   The place looked run down and the aura is just very off ...   After ordering my pizza and was ready to eat it in excitement .   After the pizza was brought out , I asked again if there's cheese in the pizza , they said yes normal cheese not vegan cheese .   I said ok . Let it go ... (imagine if I didn't check just to be sure) .  Waited again ...   Came out with no basil . They gave me raw basil leaves to put on top of it even though the first one was baked .   No biggie . Things happened .   Doesn't take away from the   Lack of professionalism Ran out , cheap place (including restaurant and the workers).   I just sat the pizza there untouched and left .",

Full bar, great service and a real good selection of beers. We arrived at dinner time and they were pretty busy. We were greeted at the door when we walked in and waited only a moment for the excellent staff to finish clearing a table for us. The waitress brought us waters and we ordered drinks 3 beers and a cocktail, arrived at the table promptly and all at the same time. We ordered salads and pizza requesting salads first. Our salad arrived only a few moments later. The spinach salad was delicious and by how quickly our table got quiet I can say everyone's salad tasted equally yummy. Pizza finished the evenings fun the vegetable pizza came on a cauliflower crust at our request and was so good. The vegetables were cooked just right, done crisp and great but the mushroom pizza knocked it out of the park. I highly recommend giving Brixx a try.",

I haven't been to this location in a while for this reason, but my friends wanted to eat there today and we quickly remembered why we stopped going to the uptown location. We sat down at 12:15 and at 1:30 we still didn't have our food.    Excuse 1 was \"we are busier than expected\".  I call BS on this.  Your location is uptown. The manager should be aware of uptown events and staff accordingly. If he/she doesn't, I'd consider a replacement. We knew to get there early because of 2 k own events in the area.   Excuse 2 was \"you ordered an appetizer so I put your order on hold and forgot to release it\". Of the 3 meals, only 2 arrived by 1:33.  The one that didn't arrive was the exact same as one of the other orders. We had a show at 2.  So we asked for our check.  We were comped the appetizer and meal that never arrived.   Excuse 3 was \"I wasn't told we had a pasta substitute today so your meal was ready this whole time\". SMH  There was no apology for the late food we all shared and choked down in the 10 minutes before we needed to get to our show.  Usually a manager comes by and asks about your meal/service, not today.  He/She was probably hiding from the epic fail of service   There is better food and service uptown.  Walk around the corner and go inside the 7th street station. You'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "My wife and I too our kid on a train ride uptown and had planned on eating at 7th Street Market, which was too crowded.  We remembered brixx being around the corner and headed over there.  We had a BOGO coupon for an entree there so decided to beat the crowd and get our little one fed.  We each ordered the excellently priced Lunch meal - a personal pizza with a salad - awesome since you can choose any of their pizzas and are not confined to the standard Pep or plain cheese.  I ordered the greek, and she a Peperoni.  We ordered our kid buttered noodles, because, well, he's a 4 year old that likes to say \"I no like it\" in a whiny voice.    We tried a beer that was on special - it was fruity, but that's not their fault - you have to try something to figure out if you like it.  Our waiter was new and was very friendly and enthusiastic.  He kept our waters filled and always had a smile.  Our pizza came out after a longer than anticipated wait as we watched people leave.    When the pizza did come out, it was the biggest issue.  I bit into the pizza to discover that it had arrived cold.  The cheese was melted, but it was only warm.  The real nasty part was that the sauce, toppings, and even the crust were cold to the touch.  My wife started poking into her pizzas as well and found it was cold to the touch also.  We asked for some new ones, and had to remind the trainer assisting our waiter than we would eat our salads, that had also thankfully arrived cold!  Our new pizzas came out faster than our original pizzas did, and they were cooked properly.    This is really a 2.5 star visit - the service was friendly, the price was good, but the food was just a disappointment.  The pizza just want that good and made me wish we had waited for the pizza inside of the 7th street market - it looked extremely unhealthy and delicious.  I remember Brixx being better in the past, so I hope this is just a bad visit.",

Despite it being very crowded, the restaurant stayed clean and cool!    We ordered a Margarita pizza which was freaking delicious.  Every ingredient was fresh and tasty.  Even the mozzerella was fresh, not the shredded typical stuff.  I would definitely order this pizza again.  Although this time I did not order a salad, I have in the past ordered the Brixx Salad and it is also quite excellent.    The price point is nice on the wallet.  Our pizza was $9.95 and can easily serve 2 people for dinner.    In terms of atmosphere, it is more casual but in a classy, Italian way, not a sports bar type of way.  I will be going back for sure!",

They have $2.50 and $3 specials most weeknights, too.  I love that every pizza on the menu can be completely customized, and they won't charge you an extra buck for an extra topping or whatever.  A few of my favorites after visiting this location over the past 8 or so years:  Pear and Gorgonzola pizza - this is SO GOOD.  I often order a side of marinara to dip the crust in to get that tomato taste I often crave with pizza, since this one is an olive oil base, and not traditional sauce.  Mexican pizza, no meat, with extra black beans - They never put enough black beans on it, but it's a fantastic pizza!  The new Fiesta pizza is also really good.  I like to add sour creme to it.  I was skeptical of a corn salsa on pizza, but I really like it a lot!  It's got good heat in the red pepper pesto.",

After being seated it took about 10 minutes for a waitress to stop by our table just to tell us she would be with us soon. When we finally placed our orders the pizza came out of the kitchen very quickly. (Not brought by the waitress - but a kitchen staff member) The pizza was very tasty, my husband tried the Thai Chicken and I had the pear and Gorgonzola. We both enjoyed our pizza however it took a long time for drink refills etc. So overall if you like unique pizzas, are patient and not in a hurry you might enjoy Brixx.",

And if the oven is wood fired they are doing it a grave injustice with the dough they use for the crust. It was sort of pasty white and bland with absolutely no character to it.  I know it is my personal bias but I prefer a crust that has some big air bubbles and an oven hot enough to char it just a bit   All in all I was disappointed by the food.

I chose to take advantage of the outdoor seating to try and soak up the last rays of sunshine that I was likely to see for 8 months and mostly was successful, although the clouds kept me guessing.  A quick review of the menu and I settled on the pear, walnut, and gorgonzola pizza, washed down with Diet Coke.  The pizza was pretty good - I especially enjoyed the crust, although the pears seemed slightly underdone.  The pizzas are a large personal size and it was a struggle but I did manage to finish mine off.  Service was on top of things, my soda was refilled at proper intervals, and I left with my cravings satisfied and my stomach full.  What more can you ask for?",

Very convenient to park and walk between the arena and here.   I had been to Brixx a few times before I was gluten free and have always been interested in trying their gluten free pizza. I was pretty impressed with their gluten free menu overall. It was very specific and easy to read. They offer not one, not two but THREE gluten free bottled beers, and I'm not talking cider here. Actual GF beer. I ordered the wood roasted vegetable pizza and it was quite yummy. Huge portion, I actually shared it with my non GF friend who only ordered a salad. They also cooked it in it's own pan, I'm guessing to help avoid contamination.   I was a bit of a problem child. I asked our server for the gluten free menu and then ordered a pizza but I think I forgot to specify that I wanted it gluten free. Totally my mistake, I always try to be 100% clear when ordering and specifying the gluten free option when there is one. So I received a pizza that looked very similar to one of my other friends, and I asked. It was not gluten free. Our server Chad was very nice about it, took it away and got a new pizza started. The manager then brought me a side salad so I wouldn't feel \"left out\" while my friends ate. I made sure to tell him that it was not the servers fault (I was afraid he'd get in trouble!) and that I would gladly pay for the non GF pizza. He was very understanding and did not charge me for the salad or the extra pizza.   So thanks Brixx for being awesome to this gluten free girl who was a bit lazy when ordering!",

Service - five stars. This is really the only reason for this review. Because of the late night happy hour and the fact that my friends and I usually get off work around 10 at night, we find ourselves at Brixx fairly frequently. The staff at this particular Brixx is SO accommodating and nice. They are always happy to throw a few tables together, provide prompt service, and give us separate checks - no hesitation or questions asked. These guys really deserve a freakin' medal for their awesomeness.  So, if you want a great late night happy hour, good beer or (for some reason) crave mediocre pizza with some of the best servers in town, come check out this Brixx.",

    "text": "Another great experience at Brixx!  Dropped in here for dinner last night and for the first time I actually tried their wood fired chicken salad.  It was perfect! Balsamic dressing, chestnuts, and great grilled chicken really stood out along with the goat cheese.  They serve the salads in chilled bowls and that's my favorite presentation for a salad.  The contrast of the cool greens with the warm chicken was superb.  Service was great and we had several visits to our table to see how things were going.  Another great little surprise wall Bell's Two Hearted on draught here! SCORE!",

    "text": "I've been here several times now and always love to go back. The pizza is excellent, especially if you like the artisan-ish type without grease puddles and with fresh ingredients. I know some people have negatively reviewed the pizza here, but I have to thoroughly disagree with that.   The beer selection is great, dozens of craft beers on draft. Create a sampler there! It's good value with regards to the amount The environment is nice, I feel comfortable here, and our waiters have always been great.",

    "text": "We stopped here for a quick bite to eat while visiting from out of town. When we first walked in we saw how empty it was and thought it was probably off hour. We ordered our food for take out to bring back to the hotel and ordered a margarita pizza for us  and penne pasta with marinara sauce for my son. But once we tasted the food we were not only disappointed but was also a little disgusted with how bad the food tasted. My son literally spat out the penne pasta and one bite of the margarita pizza we didnt have to courage to take a second bite. The staff was friendly and while it is kid friendly it isnt taste friendly. I think we would have better luck by ordering dominos pizza or even frozen pizza. Save yourself the trip and just order room service if your in town for a visit like us.",

    "text": "Brixx gets five stars from me for it's fantastic faux cheese. It's a rare and wonderful thing to find a fake cheese that isn't nasty. Not only is the brand Brixx carries not nasty...it's actually quite good. It's convincing enough as a fake cheese that the first time I had it, I asked the server to double-check. I was convinced I'd been cheesed inadvertently.   The salads are great, and there are lots of good appetizers. I've had some good experiences taking family there, especially when there's a variety of picky eaters coming out. There's a little something for everyone.  It can get a little busy, which slows down the service, but I haven't had the kind of bad experience that Emilie P. had. I've always found the servers to be friendly and responsive.",

    "text": "Super fast service!!!  I love all the Brixx locations and this one is no exception.  Yes it is a little not-so-glamorous to have the patio view of a parking garage and street but it is so convenient since it is right on 6th street Uptown.    I have never had a bad thing on the menu - the Pesto Chicken Salad is what I had here recently and it was delish!!!  Candied walnuts really make the difference.  Super fresh fruit on the salad - it was so much I couldnt finish it all!  Great prices and awesome service!  Park at the 7th Street station and they will validate you!!!",

Our waiter seemed very uninterested in serving us as if he had already clocked out for the night. I'd definitely return to Brixx Pizza. Just maybe not this location.",

    "text": "Most of the time I've been to Brixx is because they're having some sort of craft beer event. Yesterday I had a couple of meetings in the downtown area about an hour apart so I decided to stop by and have a couple of beers and a pizza.  The place was deserted but what do you expect for 2pm on a Thursday. My waitress was friendly and attentive. My food came out fast and my beers were poured cold. That visit was good.  In previous visits we've had some major issues with our waitstaff not having even the most remote clue about craft beer. It's always been a pet peeve of mine that craft beer venues do not hire people who know what the heck it is they're serving.  This is the biggest problem I have with Brixx. Aside from that the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is your typical downtown crowd. On weekends it gets incredibly and uncomfortably packed.  I also think it is totally awesome of them to be involve din RAIN's Amazing Bar Crawl which got the the 4th star in my book.  Overall you won't be disappointed. Pretty solid place to hang out, eat some good pizza and drink some good beer.",
