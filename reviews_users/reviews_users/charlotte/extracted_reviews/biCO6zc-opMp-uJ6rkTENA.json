    "text": "Overall pretty bad experience. Despite having 3 stars we wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and try it out. Shouldn't have. We ordered 10 wings & a noodle dish pretty quickly after we sat down per our waitresses recommendation. After 45 minutes still no food had arrived and our waitress never came over to check on us. Finally someone drops off the noodle dish, and right as we are about to dive in, they came back over and took it back stating it was for a different table...about 10 min later they brought out wings (very over fried and SO spicy, but the bonchon ones had a good taste). When we asked the waitress what happened to our other dish she blamed it on the food runner saying he messed it up and they had to \"start over\". After we finished the chicken and aimlessly waiting for his meal to come, they brought his out... not even acknowledging that at this point it's been over an hour. We also had no water refill and when we asked for it, she again blamed it on other people saying it wasn't her fault. Def won't be coming here again. Bad service = bad business. Also they had a leaking air vents that was landing on customers and their food (pic attached) #notcute",

The second time we went close to closing and sat at a table and received quick service and one time I called in the order and by time I got there it was ready. My favorite is the Shrimp Shumai with a side of white rice and the half and half Soy Garlic wings. The wings are definitely excellent, nice and crispy and done all the way through but not burned. I even put my son on to them and he's 16 and he absolutely loved the wings!",

Not just for any restaurant but an establishment that is not a fine dining environment....which would still likely do takeout if asked!  They are new so maybe that is why?  We are baffled.  And he is now at Co across the street giving them the business that BonChon just gave up.",

I ordered the Spicy Wings at Bonchon. They smelled great, a little spicier than what I was used to in Honolulu. After a few bites I knew they were more than I could handle. The waitress had warned me but they were so spicy my ears were plugged, nose was running, lips were on fire. I ate half and took the rest home. Shared them with my neighbor who loves spicy food. He said he could only eat one a day. I'll probably go back and get them again, as spicy as they were they were still delicious .",

We take our fried chicken very seriously! As a matter of fact, don't expect anything like the regular chicken you're used to. This is a very (did I mention, VERY) crispy fried chicken. There are two main flavors, Spicy and Soy Garlic. You can also get it with the two flavors mixed. The chicken is moist on the inside. The flavors a little on the sweet and savory side. I also ordered the pork belly buns. The best I had so far!  The staff there is very friendly and attentive.

I expected service to be abysmal considering we went on the first day they opened and once more during their first week so the stars are based solely on the food.  So far, we've had the seasoned fries, takoyaki, chicken katsu, and the soy garlic wings.  The seasoned fries were a fail. While they had a nice flavor, they were too hard from being fried for too long. It was also absurdly expensive at $7. I'd rather buy a bag of frozen fries at a grocery store and fry them up myself.   The takoyaki was decent. I prefer takoyaki to be a bit more crisp on the outside than how Bonchon makes them and the bonito flakes were lacking but the flavor satisfied our craving.  The chicken katsu could be better. The portion was generous but just like the fries, the cutlet was fried for too long and it was incredibly hard to eat. It's also fairly pricey and there are other restaurants in the Charlotte area where you can get better and cheaper katsu.  As for the chicken wings. we were devastatingly disappointed. You could tell they were trying to skimp on portions because we had pieces that were as long as our thumb. I remember other Bonchon locations had wings that were comparable to this location's drumsticks. The coating is also disappointing. One of the most memorable things about Bonchon in NoVa was how crisp and thin the chicken coating was. Our chicken actually stayed crispy 9 hours later when we ate the leftovers for breakfast and we were hoping this location could replicate that experience. However, the chicken coating here is much thicker, similar to Chinese double fried chicken. While the chicken can stay crisp for a few hours, it's difficult to eat because it hardens rather than retaining the same texture.   Overall, I think we're hesitant about visiting this location again because the quality of the food here does not justify the high prices. It's worth driving to NoVa to satisfy that KFC itch.",

    "text": "Best Korean chicken wings you'll ever eat! Hot, crisp and the perfect amount of heat. So many places do bad versions of this style of wings with their over tempura battered flappers. Not Bonchon, these wings where cooked to perfection. We tried the Bull Dak which is spicy chicken stir fry (warning: this dish is not for the faint of heart... this will light you up!) Loved it but if you're at all sensitive to heat stay clear of this one. The price was on point and portion sizes are big.   We came for the soft opening. One can only expect a little longer wait for tables and food. I'm sure once they hit their groove, food will start flying out the window. Service was prompt and friendly.   Fingers crossed, I hope this place out lives it's predecessors.",

My sister did it, so we got to try the fries, nice and crispy and hot. We also got the shumai, some chicken wings, half and half sauce, and an order or bibim bap. We finished the shumai, fries, and the bibim bap. The sauce and coating on the wings were not very good. The spicy was way too spicy for us but maybe we could have eaten it if the breaded coating wasn't so thick. It was my first time having korean wings, maybe it's just not my thing but the other food wasn't very good either.",

    "text": "Read this before you go: Hint #1:This is meant to be a family-style restaurant, meaning that you get little plates and everyone takes some of each entree on their little plate. Hint #2: This is a Korean restaurant, meaning the food is Korean spicy. If you don't like spicy, do not get the tteokkboki or the spicy chicken. If things are really spicy for you, you can cool off your mouth with rice, pickled radish or iced tea. Hint #3: If you get the bibimbap, PLEASE, mix it all together and add gochujang sauce to your desired spicy level. You can always add more sauce on your own plate.  We had a great experience - we were seated quickly, we got our food fairly quickly, everything was hot (temp wise) and our drinks were refilled before we asked. We did go after 3 on a Sunday, though. And the food, the food was SO GOOD!   The only downside was that the food did not come out all at once but if you share it family style, you just start with what comes out first.  I wish BonChon luck because we would like to be regulars.",

I think that they are slightly over priced for the portion size that you receive, but I would definitely give them another try in a few months to see if they have ironed out their operations. They are definitely worth a try though.",

    "text": "Came here on the 2nd day. Wings were great- our order was mixed up so we got some drums instead of wings. We mentioned it to our server and they fixed it for us. The drums were drier than the wings, I recommend doing the wings- much juicier. Both flavors are worth trying but the spicy on day 2 was very hot and the sauce was thin and didn't have a hint of sweetness. It was missing something or had too much of something, didn't seem like it was 100% together....The soy garlic was perfect. We had the Japchae (glass noodles with marinated beef and crunchy veggies) and it came out piping hot and was great. Just how Mom used to make it. Radish was not on the plate when the wings came out. Rice was a little dry.   Our service was slow but that doesn't necessarily mean it was our server, we were told the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed and they had us wait 10 minutes before they sat us even though the restaurant had available seating- which is totally OK! I rather them do that than seat everyone and have even longer ticket times. It's better for everyone that way, at first.   So, since this place is brand new, be prepared to wait to get seated and for the process to be slow, but the food is worth it. Expect it to be a longer wait during peak hours on weekends. Front door is super nice and our server was too. NO TAKE OUT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.  I would give the whole experience a 3.5 but the food was a solid 4, which I consider very impressive on a soft opening. Can't wait to come back. This is going to be the best place in Charlotte for Korean fried chicken and traditional Korean food! So much better than that \"Korean\" restaurant in South End.  *I would like to point out that the tip suggestions at the bottom of the receipt is incorrect. The percentages should be based on the grand total, we would have under tipped if it wasn't for us doing the math ourselves instead of trusting the suggestion.*",

We ordered the seasoned fries, the potstickers with soy garlic sauce, house fried rice with no meat, wings with soy garlic sauce. The spicy sauce has a delayed effect, so if you do not like hot foods, try the soy garlic sauce. The seasoned fries are battered and fried hard but the fries are not dried out. They have Parmesan cheese on them with a little parsley. The potstickers are really tasty. The house fried rice a different. Good but different. The wings come in even number increments and they give you the same number of flats and drums. The wings come with pickled radishes to help cool your mouth and cleanse your palate. They give you a bucket to put your bones in for your table which is a great idea. Our server was attentive and nice. The chicken is really crispy but dried out either. All of the food came out really hot. I have not tasted their flavors anywhere else, so I will definitely be back.",

Either way, the chicken was still solid and we tried the shrimp schuman as an app.  Anything that is twice fried is definitely on my radar, but the entire experience of the restaurant wasn't well rounded.  Maybe they had a ton of last minute Sunday evening take-out orders.... but maybe that's the route to go for next time.

We walked in and the mildew smell shoukd have tuned us right around. I'm embarrassed we staid. Saw several fruit flies, plates and silverware were dirty or wet, and the windows by where we were sat were filthy. I asked for extra sauce on the chicken and it didn't happen. Even the after dinner mint they gave us were stale. Will be back.... But will NEVER be back to this dirty location. Gross!",

The wings are fried to perfection with just the right out of crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. How often do you find a wing with sauce that's still crispy and not dry... how often sway? Exactly!   As if the wings aren't enough, the fried rice is my actual reason to visit. Since moving from Northern NJ I haven't found a place with fried rice that rivaled my NYC favs but Bon Chon has filled that void. The fried rice with Bugogi is everything.",

Although it was not full we were pleasantly surprised to see Korean customers at the restaurant. This was a good sign for a chain Korean restaurant.   Both my wife and I had one of our favorites: Bibimbap. Actually in other places this would be called \"Dol sot bibimbap\" since it was served on a hot stone bowl. My wife had bibimbap with seafood. I had bibimbap with tofu. Both were very tasty. My wife's had plenty of seafood: squid and shrimp. The red sauce was delicious and spicy. We both loved the heat on our tongues!!  The stone bowl was piping hot and made the rice nice and crispy. I tried to save half of the dish for leftovers. But after I got home it kept calling me from the refrigerator. After an hour I lost my will power and inhaled the rest of it.   Can't wait to go back and for the Pineville store to open soon.",

He reported the chicken strips as being dry. The price was a little high. Overall I was not impressed. I noticed a number of other Korean dishes on the menus other than Bon Chon but I have no desire to try them. I marginally recommend this Resturant. Maybe someone could convince me to try it again.",

Walking in it kinda looks like a dive bar compared to the one near my old place in DC.  While sadly it does not measure up to the one I was introduced to the chicken is still quite good. There were some hiccups when they had first opened that made for some subpar chicken but that has since been rectified.  Can't say much for the dine in experience as I usually just place a to go order for here. It's a great option if you are looking for a quick fix on Korean fried chicken.",

The other flavor is much better but I don't want spicy with an almost overly too sweet taste to it every time either, but at least it's good with rice. The crispness is what's addicting for sure. I had the salmon ball when they first opened and loved it. 2nd time I ordered it recently was strange,  the salmon was so hard you couldn't break a piece off with the fork,  half of it just came along with it when i tried instead.

I will visit this place again, specifically for the fried chicken. They forgot about my bibimpop so I was a little disappointed (that's why 1 star is missing).  Fried chicken - 5 STARS!!!!  hands down so good! Will definitely order it again. $8.95 for 8 wings + 1 side (lunch special)  Bulgogi - 4 stars You can taste that I was actually grilled, which brings out the flavors a lot.  Way too expensive for the portion $15.95 so I'll probably won't order it again.   Tteokbokki -  It wasn't bad but it wasn't extremely tasty either.  $10.95 pretty average price. I will order it again.  Sodas are $2. Of course, totally overpriced.",

Ambiance did not make feel like I was at a Korean restaurant and they still don't have a liquor license. For something different and reasonably priced this place is excellent, but don't expect a wide variety of different Korean dinners that is not what they are going for.

So I ordered the Chicken Katsu and it was pretty good, not the best I've ever had but definitely a solid one. The Katsu is sliced a little thin but it still tastes good. Now the wings, those are pretty great. There are only 2 flavors soy garlic and spicy. The soy garlic is definitely tasty and the spicy flavor is most definitely spicy and that is coming from someone that almost always eats spicy food. So yes it is really good but I warn you to be careful if you haven't had spicy foods before, definitely not an entry level spice. But yet again it is tasty. The Wings have a really awesome crisp to them, if you go thinking they're gonna feel like KFC style Chicken you will be pleasantly surprised that they are way better. I personally am not a fan of the pickled radish. But overall experience was great, not enough to be 5 stars but just slightly scraping at it. I may give it more stars after trying more dishes.",

The fried rice did not have much flavor, the potstickers were a little to crispy so it really impeded the flavor. The only thing that I felt had flavor was the chicken wings. They were crispy and the soy-ginger flavor was really good. Other than that, I don't really think we would go back.",

Right when we walked in the lady at the reception which is the manager I think? Smiled and greeted us in(: We ordered the udon noodle soup, tofu bibimbap & a side of kimchi to share, I was sooo sad when our server told me they didn't serve the kimchi pancake anymore, booo. But I really like how the put all the calories of each dish on the menu, really helps when your trying to watch your weight lol! The udon noodle soup was so filling and, the flavor of the soup wasn't overwhelming and very light. (All for under 300 calories?? Yasss!) The bibimbap wasn't the BEST I had but it was very good as well, tofu was crunchy on the outside and very soft in the inside. The kimchi though... perfect! It was very very spicy, & the salt was on point! If you order the bibimbap you MUST get the kimchi to go with it, otherwise it would just lack flavor! Also during our meal the manager lady stopped by and checked on us, she's seems so sweet! I really like how the food didn't give us a \"food baby\" and how it was all lightweight & had a \"healthy\" feel!",

Never have I ever quite so crispy of a wing...I have been always searching for a Crispy without being greasy wing. We had a big group, everyone had an assortment of Spicy, Soy , Drums,Wings  and Boneless Wings. I had the spicy, I loved them...just when you think it is too hot for your mouth the little bit of sweetness kicks in! We had the Pot Stickers, they were great and stuffed with filling. We had the Salmon ball, which was good and had crab and green onions inside and crispy panko chips on top. We had the Shrimp Shumai, which were darling little dumplings with a spicy wasabi mayo on top. We also tasted the Bulgogi tacos, which were delicious. This is not a fancy place, Water is served in plastic coke glasses, but the WINGS ARE STRAIGHT FROM FRIED HEAVEN!! Go...Go Now....",

And then it took 15 minutes to take our drink orders. By then we knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered our drinks, appetizer and entrees all at the same time.   I got my entree after an hour wait. About 5 minutes later she brought our appetizer out but it took another 20 minutes for my friend to get her entree. All together it took us 2+ hours to eat dinner..  The waitress was nice and apologized and brought us a free kimchi for the inconvenience but then told us that it was just a busy Saturday night like that excused the awful service. We watched at least 4 tables of people walk out without their food because of the crazy long wait times.  All that being said, the food was delicious and everything we expected it to be, but not worth the wait.",

    "text": "Fried chicken is a huge thing in South Korea right now. Fried chicken joints flood the streets of Seoul more than fast food joints and greasy spoons do in this area. And Bonchon is my favorite of all of them.  Whether in Korea, California, New York, or here, Bonchon Chicken has never disappointed me yet.  The chicken is double fried to have a perfectly crispy shell wrapped around tender juicy chicken meat, and their glazes are the tastiest of the Korean fried chicken chains.  Go ahead and order anything on the menu, just be aware that those other choices might not be as tasty because their specialty is the sauce. Yea, the sauce. Anybody can fry up some chicken, but the sauce makes it unique. So if you are new to Bonchon or Korean fried chicken culture in general, anything with the glaze are what you want to try first.",

    "text": "Mediocre at best. I was super excited to try this place. It was about time Charlotte got some Korean Fried Chicken. It took us a long time to try the place - just life happens and it has even taken me longer to write the review. Overall, I was just underwhelmed with the place.   My experience with Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is very different than this location. I have gone to Bonchon in other cities and my expectations were high. Typically, when going out to eat for KFC - you would call in your order before you get there. The reason for this is because they make every order fresh. It takes a good 30-40 minutes to cook the chicken the correct way. And if you don't call it in before you get there, they will tell you it will take that long. But normally this fine. You come with friends, have some drinks, some appetizers and all is well.  So I was so confused when my chicken wings came out literally less than 10 minutes after ordering. They were flavored well & crispy. Just not that piping hot and fresh crispy that I am accustomed to.   My man wanted to try the chicken strips so we did - and I say definitely pass on these. The wings win hands down.   We also ordered seasoned fries - they were a frozen variety. Fried well and alright with us. On the chicken wings and strips - we ordered half and half on both. The soy was sweet and the spicy had a nice heat to it. The flavor was there and definitely did not disappoint. But it just blew my mind that they could have our chicken ready so fast. It means they do the first fry early and they do the 2nd fry when you order. This does not optimize for the best KFC in my opinion. The chicken wings were definitely the best part of our meal however.  Also order the Tapoyaki - and these are not for the faint of heart. They have a fishy taste to them and this could not fair well with most but I really enjoyed them. They were warm and overall okay! The japchae was okay as well. Seasoned fairly. I took them home and jazzed them up a bit. And the sliders were actually fair. They were just super sweet and a little dry.",

    "text": "I moved down from DC in the beginning of September and one sad point about that is that there are a few Bonchon's in the DC/Arlington area that are incredible. There's no possible way there would be such good Korean Friend Chicken or even a Bonchon in Charlotte right? WRONG.  I don't remember exactly when I looked up if there was a Bonchon in Charlotte but I remember texting my girlfriend immediately and being SUPER happy.  I got it for the first time finally on the way back from a 7 hour road trip (From DC, actually) so I just knew I needed it. I live in Noda so I essentially drove us past our house by 20 minutes and then back. Definitely worth it.  I got my usual strips half and half and potstickers half and half. There are mostly similarities between DC and Charlotte Bonchon, but there are some noticeable differences.   First, the potstickers in Charlotte have both pork AND vegetables - which I prefer. That wasn't even an option in DC, only pork potstickers there. Second, I noticed that the chicken is noticeably thinner in Charlotte for the strips. The Arlington and DC locations were much thicker. You still got the signature Bonchon crunch, so I can't complain too much.  Also, for the first time I tried their beef fried rice. Nothing too innovative or crazy, but it was pretty tasty!  I've yet to try any other KFC while in the area, but Bonchon will always be a solid go to when I need it.",

There is also a chicken option.  Hubby loved the Signature Fried Chicken with spicy sauce. Sooooo crispy! If you like vinegar, check out the Pickled Radish side... its sweet but so crunchy! The fries as a side are much more filling if you're hungry though.  I ordered an additional appetizer side of Takoyaki: Fried octopus dumplings drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise, Katsu sauce and sprinkled with bonito flakes. The smell was overwhelmingly fishy and unfortunately they were soggy and unappetizing. I ate 2 and felt sick, I'm going to have to call and get a refund for them, they were just no where near right.",

I've been to both locations (Woodlawn and Pineville-Matthews), and I've been fairly happy with all the foods I've ordered.  As expected, the chicken is delicious... double-fried and heavily seasoned.  I've also tried and liked their Bulgogi Wrap, BiBimBap, Tacos, Pork Buns, JapChae, Fried Rice, Potstickers (Yes, I've been there several times by now...so this is actually a cumulative review)...and surprisingly, Kimchee tasted very authentic!  The only item that I tried and found disappointing was Tteokbokki...not even semi-authentic.  Being Korean, I've tried many truly delicious Tteokbokki, and this is just not it.  Though I'm not big into chain restaurants, I welcome BonChon for the simple fact that it's a great restaurant for folks who never tried Korean foods.  It's very inviting, with an Americanized Korean menu, complete with pictures!  If you haven't been, you should give it a try...if only for its super-charged chicken!",

I actually asked for a bit more of the soy garlic sauce and the waiter said they couldn't provide it on the side which was really odd. The chicken was cooked perfectly and crispy yet juicy. I also tried the bulgogi recently and it was good also. It's a bit on the expensive side for the amount you get but it was flavorful. I'll stop back in here when I want some good ol fried chicken.",

If you've had the pleasure of visiting a Bon Chon in another location then you will know what the hype is about . -so I leave you with 4stars , nom nom   Let's address the issues because I feel the food will speak for itself if you get your correct order . We called in our order at 11:10 and arrived at the resturant at 11:40 , we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for it to be ready . 1) ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 combo lunch , supposed to be 4 wings and two drums , mixed with soy garlic &spicy . Bon Chon, I'm all for free food but if you continue to give people more than what they paid for, your revenue will be all screwed up. We ended up with 6wings and 4 drums , one box was mixed  flavors , one box was all soy ginger .   2) you are an Asian fusion resturant how did you not have white rice cooked and ready, I'm still in shock . So we were given the fries instead which are delicious by the way , However I wanted rice to eat with my side of   3) kimchi cole slaw , where was it ???? Instead I was given a side of kimchi. Good thing I can eat kimchi with anything, but not good that it's not much of a work food you crack open for others to smell .   To sum this all up , get organized , please ... I would hate for others to not enjoy the yummy factor due to disoriented employees and incorrect food orders .",

When I received my order I thought I had put in the wrong order because the box had gotten significantly smaller. I was disappointed but I put my faith into the place and went home. However. When I opened the box, I realized the chicken strips are half the size of what they used to be. Not only this, but the radish I got as a side was spoiled as well. I am so disappointed. Will not be going back to Bonchon in this location and I don't think I'll ever recommend this place for anyone else either.",

The only reason I cannot give this place 5 stars is the wait staff.  I have been there multiple times during lunch hours Monday to Friday and the same woman has been there each time.  She was the only server present, she was in the back most of my visit, she held my water glass by the brim, and she kept complaining that she was behind.

Definitely not what I expected compared to the awesome BonChon I've been to in KTown of NYC.  1. Let's talk about service.  If I walk in, I sort of expect to be seated if 3/4ths of the establishment is empty, but it doesn't help if you have servers mingling on the side.  2. Way overpriced for what you get including their bite sized apps.  3. Now quality from 1 to 10. Probably a 4. The flavor of the soy glazed wings were definitely on point, however, not good enough to compensate for the overly battered and overcooked wings.  This place could be a hit or miss, but I don't think I will be coming back a 2nd time to find out.",

For my meal, I ordered the boneless chicken. My 3 stars is really because the smallest order is 10 pieces of chicken and then it comes with a small side. The chicken was good but the serving was so massive that I ended up taking 2/3 of them home and eating them for leftovers twice. What was disappointing was that it felt like I had a giant plate of fried chicken and nothing else to eat with it.   It would have been better to order the smallest boneless chicken between the two of us and order several sides for the table. Maybe this is how you're supposed to order the boneless chicken there, but we received no guidance or recommendations from our server.",

My waitress was nice and I was seated right away, but that's about where the positives stop.   I ordered an order of Fried Shrimp Shumai. It was okay, nothing mind blowing or different from what I've had at normal Japanese restaurants. It didn't feel very Korean. Next I had an order of Pork Buns. They were probably the worst I've ever had. The cold slaw and sauce were so over powering that I could not taste the pork belly at all. The steam buns were not warm and almost cold. One fell apart and was firm. All things a steam bun should not be.   The Shumai didn't take very long to come out but the Pork Buns seemed to take forever. Which is crazy as it's just 3 tiny pieces of pork and everything else doesn't need to be warmed up. There were only two waitresses and they were both a little scattered around so it took longer than it should at some points due to that. Even the couple next to me made comments about her being busy. It wasn't really crowded at all, so I don't think the slowness was justified.   Being that I've had really awesome KBBQ wings and Pork Buns elsewhere, I don't see myself coming back. For the price, I expect a lot more in the flavor and quality department.",

    "text": "With all the amazing places in Charlotte, this one is safe to skip.  HOWEVER I didn't try the korean fried chicken- so that might be what draws people in.  Food: I tried the fried shrimp dumplings to start.  These were just fine.  I think if they didn't have a honey mustard sauce they would have been pretty boring.  I also had the Vegetarian Udon soup with added shrimp/scallops/calamari - this had absolutely NO flavor. I was really disappointed there was no \"oomph\" to the broth at all.  The shrimp was decent but the calamari was chewy instead of tender.  They did include mushrooms, lemongrass, bean sprouts and seaweed but none of it had flavor sadly.   Service:  The servers were very nice and took great care of me.  However, they didn't seem to like the food they were serving and didn't seem surprised that I had a bad experience.   Decor: clean space with lots of black tables and black booths.  There's definitely a \"chain restaurant\" vibe going on.  I did like that they had fun 90's music and large TVs.   Drinks: I had hot tea, which wasn't mind blowing. They do offer a full bar and have daily drink specials.",

I've visited this location twice and unfortunately they over cooked the chicken each time. I know kfc is supposed to be fried twice but you know it's over done when you order spicy flavor but all you can taste is a hint of spicy and a whole lot of burnt smoke flavor instead. Maybe I'd return if my cravings get to me but for now, I'll pass.",

When I got home, I opened everything up and these are my thoughts. The calamari, which is not on the menu bir they still sell, was not great. A little too greasy for me. The soy garlic wings were good. They held up their crunch. I also got the glass noodles which were my favorite out the bunch. Unfortunately I probably won't go back. If I do it will just be for the chicken.",

Really inadequate service. Not even a phone call to notified the paid customer their order is ready for pick up, just straight up closed the store. Scam practices.",

It was not busy but our food came out super slow and somehow our appetizer came out after our main meals...we got the salmon avocado ball appetizer and it was not good at all. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be warm or cold (it was like a weird inbetween--not quite lukewarm but not cold...). We also both got the wings with both flavors. The wings were good, I preferred the spicy kind! But know in advance that it's a LOT of food. Like a lot, so I would recommend getting a size smaller than you think you'd eat because we couldn't finish it all.  Overall, the info were good, don't do the salmon avocado ball, slow service, and inattentive waiters.",

If you let it sit the rice gets a little crispy.",

We were seated immediately, and a few minutes later our waitress came back and we placed our order. Not too long after our food came out. And that's basically when the service stopped. No one came to check on us, refill our water, see if we liked the food. We had to flag down a waiter eventually, because none of them were looking in our direction. We finally got our waters refilled, and we sent back the calamari because it tasted terrible. The restaurant did get a bit busy after we placed our order, but that's no excuse for the terrible service we received.  While the food was not bad, our experience was, and therefore we will not be going back. Would not recommend",

My brother and I went for a Sunday dinner during my last visit one month ago. It wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. Our server was nice, but didn't really check up on us during our meal. I really did want more water.  Anyway, we came for their signature chicken. After trying the Shrimp Schuman (Fried) to tide us over, I was awaiting the crispy, saucy goodness. The shumai was blah and the honey Dijon sauce was too sweet. We ordered the medium Signature Fried Chicken in Soy Garlic drums (8 pieces) that came with two sides of the pickled radish. The chicken was as crispy and juicy as I remembered. The sauce was flavorful. The fries were also good, thick, nice and crispy, and an evenly seasoned batter.  Glad to hear Bonchon will be opening in a Chicago soon. It'll have some stiff competition with local standards, but always nice to have another option to get my fried chicken fix.",

I ordered the Soy Garlic chicken wings & the Shrimp Shumai as the appetizers. Those chicken wings deserve a standing ovation. They were soooo good, very crispy & still juicy. The Shrimp Shumai was something new for me, but I'm glad that I did. They're easy to share & comes with a tasty Dijon sauce drizzled on top. For the main dish we tried the Bibimbap, another new dish. It came in a sizzling bowl packed with rice, mushroom, octopus, scallops, & shrimp. The Korean Red Pepper Paste definitely was the best addition to the dish & gave it great flavor. My experience at Bonchon was great, my server was patience & offer great advice when it came to picking the dishes & she also helped me choose the tasty sparkling peach sake. Definitely try this place.",

A neighbor went along to check it out. Well it went from an unknown to a new favorite in one visit. Saturday night 7 PM, the place was busy. Real busy as in 20 minute wait, not that ridiculous 2 hours you get some places. The fried chicken is just outstanding, juicy, just different enough, but very unique. There are a lot of great looking things on the menu but I wonder if I'll ever get over there as the fried chicken is a go for thing! It's that good. Careful as the portions are massive. We ate at the bar. There is a full service bar, four big screen tv's and a French bartender that is a charmer. Once you figure out the size of the portions. (We have a couple of boxes in the refrigerator this AM) this place is a pretty good deal. Our check was $90 with some wine, but we easily could have fed our two teenage boys with what we boxed. So that's less than $20  a person with wine. Pretty hard to beat. Atmosphere is lively, family friendly.  Service seemed to be fast enough. I didn't notice all the delays the others have talked about. I guess they got their act together. All around a place you can put on your list of regulars. Don't miss this place.",

There will be longer wait times and food prep will most def have some issues. That being said...we came today at 5pm in order to avoid rush dinner times. And it paid off! We only waited 15 min for our food. Got an order of small wings and did half and half....the spicy wings were pretty spicy in my opinion but the soy garlic were quite tasty. The wings were crispy and plump. Also ordered the Bulgogi sliders and they too had a lot of flavor, the slaw on top tasted similar to the spicy mayo they put on sushi. I did try to get a piece of the burger without the slaw and it had flavor on its own (think I'll try with the slaw on the side next time) The service was quick and easy checkout unlike so many of these negative reviews. So please give them a try.....I don't think they should be judged so harshly just starting out. Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "Bonchon on Woodlawn you are literally my favorite.  I am just going to dive right in.  The Food - Bulgogi Beef Rice... an absolute must have. The rice is tender and fluffy. The beef is a nice thickness and seasoned to perfection. The rice also has some veggies- helps you to get over all the \"fat\" your consuming.   Fried Chicken- fried chicken like you have never taste before. The crunch is uncanny. The taste is .... unforgettable. My wife and I always order the combo with spicy and garlic.... she prefers the spicy and I like to try a scorcher every now and again. The chicken is always perfectly fried. The wings are huge- not your average tiny wing from a sports bar. They are a decent size and we generally dont actually finish the order. I must add that we also over order every time... so we are assured to be able to have the experience twice. :):)   Once you start getting that chicken from Bonchon... you start to not want fried chicken from anywhere else.",

When you come in you'll notice that there are flies and bugs, and the overall atmosphere is a little sad. The waitstaff just sits behind the bar and comes once to get your order.  The order did come out quickly but the place just felt gross and dirty. I would prefer to drive farther for the cleaner version.",

I arrived with a party of 5 which seem to be an issue for hostess as she \"had to put the tables together (insert eye roll and attitude)\" I decided to look pass that as it smell delicious.  The waitress came over to our table and offer us drinks I asked what in the alcohol menu was good to which she replied they do not make any drinks on the specialty cocktails (which are literally on the menu with the INGREDIENTS) that was strike one, she called the \"bartender\" over to talk about the menu and we finally other. My drink came to the table with particles floating on it so I returned it to which all the waitress did was give me a funny look and take it back that was strike 2. And finally to put the cherry on top of the sh*t pile that was my visit when my food came to the table there was a HAIR BALL not a hair but a HAIR BALL, again we call the waitress over to which she gave us look like what was the big deal and took the plate away and brought us a new order.  The bill came and the food was not taken out of the bill, they did not offer us an apology or acted as to care about our experience. It is safe to say I do not recommend this restaurant. The food was ok but it is not worth the hair or the employees bad attitude and service",

The restaurant was not as clean as it appeared in various photos.  The chicken was extremely hard to stomach.  We decided to order takeout so I could enjoy it in privacy. The chicken was crispy but hard, and the greasy taste was overwhelming.  To ensure it wasn't just me I tried Korean chicken from another location shortly thereafter and it was delicious.  I'm not sure if we were given a bad batch, but my experience was nothing like the others raving about the fried chicken.  I will not be returning to this establishment in the future.",

They give you huge pieces of chicken too. The spicy flavor is actually pretty spicy, from what I could tell by my friends' reactions, so order that one if you like spicy foods. I also tried seasoned fries and those were truly well seasoned.  I personally ordered a bulgogi bibimbap and I liked it! I did have to add $2 to get the bulgogi beef but the big portion was worth it.  What made this a 5-star experience was the impeccable service. I made a call just to ask for the wait time for a party of 8, without mentioning if I was actually planning to go, and when we arrived our table was already prepared with menus laid out. Our waitress was the best. She was on top of every part of our dining experience, and she was kind and humorous.",

I got their pork buns (awesome taste!) and their edamame which was a great portion. The only thing they forgot was the sauce to dip the pot stickers in...which is sometimes the best part. But perhaps it wasn't meant to be served with soy sauce to dip because of their signature Bonchon sauce however I feel as though little packets of sauce would have been better to at least have the option. All in all though this was a pretty good experience! I would order take out from them again",

    "text": "This was my first visit to a Bonchon outside of the New York City area. My previous experiences at Bonchons there had been very favorable, so I was looking forward to hopefully the same here. After flying in from NYC and while en route to Tennessee, we popped into this location to fuel up before our 4-hour drive.  We had a group of 4 adults and 3 kids and all of us had different hankerings on this day. Being the fan of Bonchon wings that I am, I didn't even need to think twice about what I ordered. The only question was who else wanted some and how many to get. After taking a commitment from each person as to how many they could eat, we wound up ordering 30 wings - 1/2 Spicy and 1/2 Soy Garlic.  Oh, before I review the actual food, I must point out one thing which cracked us up. Being that we didn't want to lounge and have a long meal, we asked how long it would take to bring out the wings. Our server responded with \"usually about 20-25 minutes if they're being made fresh but yours will take about 10 minutes or so\". Now let that sink in for a minute. What were to think? That ours weren't going to be fresh?? I decided to not say anything and, instead, wait to see how our wings were when they were brought out, ready to send them back and ask for a whole new/fresh batch if they were below par.  Instead, they came out piping hot and crispy, so we kept them. The spicy wings had great kick to them - a little too much for some in the group, but to each their own. The soy garlic had a much lighter flavor and is a good change of pace to the spicy ones. Overall, I'd give these wings a 3.5.  My wife ordered bulgogi sliders which she seemed to enjoy. Another couple shared a sesame ginger salad which looked good and was a pretty good-sized serving. The group's favorite may have been the seasoned fries which went pretty quickly.  Our server was efficient and nice. One suggestion I would make to this location is to get longer straws. When you put them into the plastic soda cups, they barely come up to the mouth of the cup. When I'm chomping away on wings and have dirty hands, the last thing I want to do is fish for my straw!  All in all, I'd give this location and dining experience 3.5 stars (and round it up to 4). No major complaints but I've had better Bonchon experiences elsewhere.",

The spicy wings specifically have some of the best seasoning/sauce I've ever tasted on chicken, and the breading was pleasant and crispy. The garlic-soy wings were very good as well, but I prefer that bite.  These wings are on my top 5 list. Make sure you're accompanied by several people if you order the fries, it is a massive serving. I highly recommend Bonchon for their chicken.",

    "text": "I love KFC - no, not the Colonel's chicken! I'm talking about Korean Fried Chicken. Yea, it's a thing. Kind of strange at first - I usually consider good fried chicken a Southern US staple. But the Koreans give us a run for our money!   There are some distinct differences between Korean fried chicken and the chicken you get at Chinese restaurants or American places. Chinese restaurants use corn starch breading and Americans vary but typically use all purpose flour breading. Koreans use rice flour and a double fry method to get the right crisp texture. Then they smother on the sauces. Here, you have a choice of either spicy or sweet and savory soy garlic.   I came here with the hubs, our son and my Mom. Five minutes after sitting down, my nephew and his friends walk in. We didn't plan this. They showed up out of nowhere. We live about 45 minutes apart and this place is the midpoint. Out of all the restaurants in the are, we chose the same one at the same time. We had two separate checks and It came down to the exact same amount. Coincidence?!?!  Nah, I believe that's God telling us to eat here more often!   I've been here before and ordered the wings I love. The rest of my party were KFC virgins so we ordered a variety of foods for everyone to try.  Let's start with the wings. The crispy crunchy chicken exterior can't be described. You have to taste It to truly know how divine It is. Its sauced by either spicy or soy garlic but the breading stays crispy the whole time! The chicken is served with pickled cubes radishes. Sounds weird at first but it's a perfect bite to cut the grease and spice from the chicken.   Now onto the other dishes:  Hubs ordered bulgolgi, fried rice and kimchi. My mom ordered japchae and an appetizer of octopus chunks. Everything was so delicious! The service was also great! Drinks were kept refilled, the waitress was an excellent resource in helping us order and the food came out promptly.   It wasn't very busy here on a Saturday night but I think people are sleeping on this joint. It's by far more delicious than other Korean joints that aren't authentic. Give this place a try!",

They should consider more variety since their chicken is fried perfectly. I wish they would marinate the meat though. The flavor comes from the outside but once you get inside, there's barely any flavor so the smell of bare chicken may be strong. Had their bibimbap. Don't. It's not worth the price. Just order white rice :p Their octopus balls were decent. A little salty for me but it's a wonderful starter. I probably won't be back though. I'll recommend you to give it a try so you can get a taste. It's not bad but I'm not going to praise it.",

Even thou there is only two flavors, soy garlic and spicy soy garlic, the wings are so crispy and tasty. I don't know what they do to make it so crispy but yeah not oily. It has a delicate crunch on it when you bite into the wings, it's not your the typical wings place you will find. But be aware that when they said spicy they mean spicy. I also order and avocado salmon ball it was very good as well, grilled salmon wrap around the avocado, crabmeat, and cucumber, and top it off with spicy mayo and ell sauce I believe it was so good. Talking about it making me want to make another visit for another try. They still don't have their alcohol there yeah, but hopefully they will get it soon. Cause that's going to be my new hangout place for the football season",

    "text": "The chicken is outstanding. Some of the best I've had in town (save the chicken at the gas station at the corner of South and East, but that's another post). Fries are crispy and flavorful, and the pickled radish is fantastic. I had a half and half wing/leg lunch combo and can't wait to go for dinner to try more of their selection.... in a few months  The 3 star review is more regarding the inefficient and unpolished service. I understand they're in a soft opening period, but mere basics of service etiquette are ignored. No explanation of upcharges (spicy mayo = $0.95, and this isn't listed on the lunch menu); having to ask for water refills and having your server point to your water cup rather than ask politely because she doesn't want to reach a few inches to pick it up; simple lunch plates coming out one at a time rather than being fired and prepared so the whole party is served at once; having to order a $1.95 side of what should have been complimentary pickled radish and wait for your server to put the order in, the receiving it halfway through the meal.   Bonchon is a cult chain for a reason. The food is outstanding and reasonably priced, but be aware they are in the middle of growing pains, and management is either new to the industry or spread too thin to see these problems. I will be back once these issues are ironed out",

    "text": "Two stars = \"Meh. I've experienced better\" and it's True - I've experienced MUCH better at other BonChon locations. I've lived in both VA and NYC, where there are koreatowns and multiple BonChon locations. The Korean chicken wings and fried accompaniments are always on point for dine-in or take out. I was SO excited when I heard a BC was opening in Charlotte. After 3-4 months of delay, it finally opened!  My husband suggested we wait a few weeks until the kinks get sorted out, but I couldn't wait because I wanted my spicy chicken wings.  We got there about 5:30 on a Friday and there were multiple tables available. After attempting to give our order to the first waitress and discovering she knew MINIMAL English, another waitress showed up and appeared very flustered...it was still pre-dinner rush!?! We ordered the onion rings, edamame, 10 wings half (soy garlic) & half (spicy) and bibimbap. Onion rings and edamame came out quickly and both were very good. The onion rings were crunchy and the kids ate it up. During the following 20 minutes that followed while we were waiting on the rest of our food, we noticed the tables next to us and in front of us all had issues with their orders. When our wings arrived, we noticed they were drumsticks and told the waitress. She said these are wings but larger, even though these were clearly drumsticks. She went back to the kitchen and came back, trying to educate us on the different parts of a wing - which these were NOT. After all her babbling, my husband motioned over to the next table that had wings and told her - \"those are wings, these are drumsticks.\" She walked back to the kitchen and came back 5 minutes later to tell us it'll be out in a few minutes. Five minutes later, we've got our half and half wings but we couldn't tell which ones were soy garlic vs. spicy, and of course our waitress couldn't tell us either. Still no bibimbap though and I had to follow up on it a couple times before I finally got it.  Chicken verdict:The spicy flavor is TOO spicy and we love spicy foods. I've had spicy at other locations and it's not usually this spicy. Beware and make sure the kids don't accidentally get a spicy piece of chicken because it is painfully spicy, overpowering the taste. Your lips are burning and your mouth is on fire for hours. The soy garlic wings were tasy when I had to confirm they were in fact soy garlic for the kids, but after eating a spicy wing, you couldn't really taste the soy garlic wing because your mouth and lips were still on fire. The white radish side dish is a good complement, but you always need more of it if you've got more than one radish-chicken combo lover.  Bibimbap verdict: Plentiful vegetables and a decent dish...not one of the best, but OK for a fast casual. Overall, could use more flavor and sesame oil. Also, could do without the yellow radish.  It took 10-15 minutes to get the check. By that time, tables were packed and there was a long wait in and out of the restaurant. I was really worried for all those diners. Service needs some MAJOR improvement. I'm not sure where they got these servers, but management clearly needs to invest in some quality employees (go visit Chick-Fil-A!) that can deliver consistently good service.  I'll give it a couple months and try take-out, if they're ready for take-out by then!",

So finally they open and of course I gave it like 2-3 month for them to get situated before going. We had a big party, about say around 15 people. There was a long wait to get seated but we didn't have any reservations so thats our fault. No complaints on that. Finally once we get seated they only had one waitress to serve us so it took forever for her take our orders. It also took eternity for them to make the food. It feels like they only had like two chef and the place was busy. The food was brought out at different times so some was left staring at the ones that was eating and we all finish our meals at different times. Two of our party didn't even receive their food at all but still got charged for it!?!? So we had to modify the bill.    Food... the tuna avocado ball was awesome. Fried chicken was very spicy and a little on salty side ( would taste great if you have a side of white rice). Didn't care for the stone pot rice dish, had it better at other Korean places.  The bulgogi (Korean bbq) was just ok. This place was not yet organized for a big party. Very slow on the whole experience and the Korean food is not authentic tasting to me (more americanized). I don't think i will give this place a second try. Not a good first visit but maybe because they are too new and needed a little more time and experience. Hope you have a better experience than i did if you try it out.",

    "text": "As is customary for all but a very select few (even that is a stretch) of the Korean and Japanese restaurants in Charlotte Bonchon fails to deliver the correct level of flavor these cuisines should have. The right flavors are there but at a 25% intensity.   We ordered the drums half soy garlic and half spicy, the bulgogi bibimbap, and the kimchi. The wings were decent but just needed double the flavor. This could be a result of the cuts of chicken they use compared to how they do it in Korea. If you've ever had KFC in Korea you will know how they use an entire chicken cut into medium pieces which lends to a perfect batter to chicken ratio, not to mention that you get dark meat and white meat. So there is a bit too much chicken to crust/sauce in these americanized chicken cuts. Doubt I will find myself craving these like I used to crave Kyochon Chicken in Seoul. The bimbimbap was a super disappointment. None of the veggies had any flavor therefore the dish severely lacked throughout. Even an excess of gochujang couldn't quite save it. If you've ever had authentic Korean food, skip this dish FOR SURE. The kimchi was fine, but it really should have come with the bimbimbap instead it is $2-3 bucks for what tastes like packaged kimchi, and it wasn't spicy in the slightest.  I didn't have any problem with the service like a lot of the other reviewers so maybe they have worked those kinks out. I just wish the food was up to par, especially considering the price you pay. So sad too, I'm sure I will give it a second shot though because I was really excited to have this place in town :/",

Chick fil a is right next door and I should've gone there instead.   And let me warn you, the spicy is spicy. And it doesn't help when the waitress does not refill your drink regularly. The soy garlic was really good though.   Also, we didn't get the full menu. We got something like a lunch menu. Later I saw folks with more choices, but it was too late our food already arrived.   The chicken was tasty, overpriced & service was poor. Probably won't be back.",

Came with my husband on a Saturday evening, 15 minutes after taking our drink and food order, our server never got our water, she went around refilling water for other guests, giving out carry out boxes and checks and literally ignored us until I flagged her down. Then she apologized. Really? This is a small place, you couldn't even see the two guests who just arrived had no drinks while you went around refilling drinks for all your other tables?   We ordered the 10pcs combo wings as appetizer but it ended up coming out after the main entrees. Soy garlic flavor is delicious and very crispy, the hot and spicy flavor was FIRE, my entire face and chest were burning up, order only if you can handle a 8 out of 10 spiciness.    The pork buns were amazing, soft fluffy taco-like white buns with tender pork belly and very flavorful mayo sauce. The stir fried clear noodle was also delicious, a bit on the sweeter side and loaded with veggies and meat.   Portion size is good, at the end we had a bit of leftover. Knowing it is grand opening I hope they work their kinks out with the service, both waiting staff and kitchen seemed overwhelmed and a bit chaotic. This is close to home I will definitely try again in a few weeks.",

This place for sure fits the category! I would only choose a restaurant that served bibimbap in stone bowls and I was so excited that this place had it! Absolutely delicious! The potstickers were crispier than I'm used to, but that's completely ok with me! They were fantastic! Had a taste of my friend's Japchae with Bulgogi and I definitely recommend that as well. I had the bibimbap with bulgogi and was so satisfied. Their amounts are large, not more bang for your buck, but definitely worth what your paying for!",

With the lunch special you get to choose from a list of complementary sides like fries, kimchi, and rice.  I got wings and fries.  My food came out piping hot and fresh!  The chicken was absolutely delicious!  It was flavorful and crispy!  The fries were hot and crispy too! Service was good as well. I will definitely be back!

I got the bibimbap bowl and it was just a ton of rice with minimal chicken which you couldn't taste and a few veggies.

Really encouraging to see Charlotte come out and support the city's developing cuisines. We ordered the half and half combo, the salmon avocado roll, the japchae, and the pork belly buns. The fried chicken is not as crispy or as big as the other Bon Chon I've been to (I think this location uses more sauce) but overall still good. I knew this going in, but a forewarning to those who haven't tried the spicy. It's VERY spicy (even though all my Korean friends say it's just normal lol). It's the kind of spice that stays with you, which is not my favorite, because then it ruins the taste of any other foods you eat after. Japchae was awesome and a big portion. Pork belly buns are okay - definitely have had better. Salmon avocado roll was good as well.",

We walk in good music is playing. We were seated immediately. Our drink orders were taken promptly. We like fast and friendly service. I beleive the waitress was new but we'll get to that shortly. We ordered to start calamari one of our favorite apps. He ordered the wings soy garlic I ordered the fried rice with chicken and shrimp.  The calamari was huge it came in a fluted vase like bowl that for one person would be an entire meal. There was no dipping sauce or lemon. Ok so we asked for lemon and dipping sauce. The waitress made us feel like we inconvenienced her by asking for this. I dont know of more than a few fried foods that do not come with dipping sauces. Calamari however is not one of those foods that do not come with sauce. We order siracha sauce but it was too spicy for hubby so we sent the entire dish back. Disappointed!!! Next up was our meal, the wings PERFECTLY fried. Crispy and not over cooked. The sauce mediocre. I love the crispness of the wings. Again there was no sauce we like Bleu cheese but at least we were able to get ranch. The wings come with a radish relish that is delish. I ate that in place of my food.  The rice was ok. It didn't have enough flavor to WOW me. It was ok. I took it home bc I couldn't eat it. I'm doctoring it tonight for dinner.  Because of the constant  change of our waitress' demeanour when asked for something, along with only liking one out of the 3 items that were ordered, I would not recommend this place for anything but the wings. That itself is another issue I have. There are more flavors of Korean bbq than just spicy and soy ginger. Why not add those flavors? Fried food should also come with dipping sauces along with the option of salt and peper. And lastly waitresses  should be accustomed to being asked for things. The waitress we had changed her demeanor and her face if we asked for anything. Not cool",

It was really good and pretty spicy. The only downfall was the stone dish it came out on. It was like food still cooking while you are eating. It never cooled down and was almost unpleasant to eat. Eventually it started make the rice crispy (which i really like) then burning. I had to ask for a regular bowl to save my dish.   Food is probably good service is appalling. I ended up leaving my togo plate by accident and came back for it but the waitress was very vague about throwing it away and tried to laugh it off. I just smiled shook my head and said thank you.

    "text": "My disinter raves about this place so I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately she didn't tell me until after that it's because of their chicken. So I of corse order bulgulgi (beef) at a chicken place.  It wasn't too bad. I'd eat it again it was just a little sweeter and smaller pieces of beef than I am use to. I also had the shrimp dumplings which were different than I was expecting but good. They came with a sweet cream sauce on top. Needless to say I will be heading back to try to the chicken and will update my review when i do.",

    "text": "I have lived in Korea for 4 years and I love Korean Food, this is a fusion place but the flavors are traditional.  The food comes out fresh and hot.  When the menu says spicy it actually is, so if you don't like spicy try something else.  I had the shrimp dumplings and they were so good.  We also tried the spicy chicken tacos, bulgogi, chicken fried rice, and the spicy chicken wings.  All the food was superb. The chicken is so crispy and juicy.  I would recommend this place, the only down side is food comes out as it is ready so not at the same time. I never mind that but some do.",

The soy garlic chicken was kind of bland.    Octopus pot sticker were mushy flavor was ok.    Chicken fried rice was fresh - the flavor was just ok   The chicken wrap was our favorite - good flavor and fresh ingredients and had a nice spicy sauce.",

    "text": "\"It is against our policy to give extra sauce.\" - The Management  Honestly, the wings were pretty good and crispy, and our server was friendly -- but the reason I'm leaving a one-star review is because of a ridiculous company policy.  When my spicy wings arrived, they were a little light on sauce.  I asked for extra sauce, and the waitress brought me a bottle of sriracha.  \"I don't want sriracha,\" I said.  \"I want more of the sauce that came on the wings.\"  The waitress explained that I can't have any more of that sauce.  Seriously.  \"It's a secret sauce,\" she explained.  When I asked what that had to do with me not getting enough sauce on my wings, she took me back to the kitchen and asked a cook in front of me if I could have more sauce.  \"No,\" he said. \"Company policy.\"  When I offered to pay, he rudely ignored me and walked away from the window.  The waitress rolled her eyes and apologized to me.  She obviously thought it was a stupid policy herself, but she said there was nothing she could do about it.  By that time, my wings were cold; but I didn't bother complaining, because I figured it was company policy to not reheat them either.",

We waited for our food at the bar for which there was no bartender.

Needless to say, we won't be returning.",
