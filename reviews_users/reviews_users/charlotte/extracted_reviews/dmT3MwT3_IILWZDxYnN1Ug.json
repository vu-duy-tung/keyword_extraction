Portion size, it's pretty small but it took me forever to finish it because I was dreading every bite. I opened the box and it just did not look appealing whatsoever. It was soggy and the juices from the beets were leaking out of the box. Maybe it's a little too healthy, which is why I did not enjoy my salad very much. I think next time I will opt for a grain bowl. However, my coworker got the grain bowl and it came in an even smaller box.",

This was my first experience with this restaurant, and it will definitely be my last. Beyond terrible.",

(Even the person that ordered online had to wait bc they hadn't made it yet) When I tried to ask them about the Stealz app that I had that said I got a free grabbasnack neither knew what to do so I just put it away and waited another 15 min for my order, a kids smoothie and an Amazonia acai cup.

    "text": "Thankful to have a healthier lunch option in Uptown, as it is an area surprisingly lacking in healthy, affordable quick places to eat that are tasty, but compared to other salad/health places I've had (e.g. Sweetgreen or Lemonade) in other cities, I would put Grabbagreen on the same level as Freshii or Energy Cafe. The website looks great and the ingredients are promising, but there are a few hiccups.   I ordered the South Beach that comes with avocado, beet, blueberry, hemp, kale, parsley, pistachio, spinach, feta and a mediterranean pomegranate sauce. Sounds great, but when I got back to my office, I opened up a salad with a brown avocado, maybe 6 blueberries total, and no hemp or feta. All in all it was a fine salad, but part of the appeal of this place is the diversity in ingredients, and if not all ingredients are included, it somewhat defeats the purpose.   Also - beware the pricing on the proteins - its $3 to add any protein, including blackbeans or edamame...since when do black beans and edamame cost the same as steak or salmon?   I was hoping for a better showing from Grabbagreen. It is a quick fix for a healthier lunch. However the food I received (or lack there of) for the price I paid definitely left something to be desired. Not sure if I'll be back.",

More than a few times, ingredients such as salmon, chicken and shrimp were not fresh. As far as bowls and salads, the employees here don't seem to know what they are doing, looking and acting very confused.

There were 2 people waiting for their order and 2 people in front of us in line. My friend placed her order and although I was going to order a smoothie, I was too overwhelmed with awesome choices so I went to the side to decide. We waited, and waited, and waited. Another rush came and 7 more people ordered after us. The frustrating part was watching the staff. No one took ownership of one order, it was a line of work. Usually that would work, but it seemed an array of chaos. People were running back and forth, no one was finishing the orders, and people kept yelling customer's names to ask them what they ordered after they already waited 15 minutes plus.  After 25 minutes for a rice/grain entree, my friend opened up her small box (seriously $10 for a tiny box??!) and this is what she ordered....Avocado, Brown Rice, Cayenne, Parsley, Red Onion, Red Pepper, Shrimp, Spinach, Creamy Avocado Sauce   Hers was filled with...brown rice, parsley, CORN, BROCCOLI (3 pieces), shrimp I didn't even order my smoothie because I was too sad looking at the limp parsley bits.  I really want to like you Grabbagreen. You have awesome choices....please work it out!",

Tonight I tried to go in and it was 9:10pm on a Friday. The doors are locked and two employees tell me they're closed. \"Sorry\". They said \"We only close at 10 on weekends.\" Isn't Friday a weekend I thought to myself. Maybe I was confused? So I confirm that today is Friday and the door, website, and Yelp say Grabbagreen does not close until 10:00 pm on Friday.   Unfortunately, this is completely unacceptable. Two employees either simultaneously forgot what day it was, tried to close early, or there are errors on three separate informative sources. I used to work in the food service all through high school, I get it. No one likes to serve after you've started cleaning and/or tasted the joy of closing time. However, you have to deal with it for the paycheck and the respect of the business you're working for. And... it was 50 minutes until close... not two.   I will update my review when I actually get the chance to taste the food, that is if I decide to try again. I feel this needs to be brought to the management teams attention for the sake of future success.",

It's in the former Yoforia space in the Epicentre. The shop is very clean and attractive. There isn't much room to eat in, so I imagine in cold weather it's going to get very snug in there. On a nice day like today, though, the doors are open and it's quite pleasant.   A manager told me while we were waiting in line that Grabbagreen is structured such that once you've placed your order, you should receive your food in five minutes or fewer. It's a flurry of activity behind the counter -- there were probably a dozen employees assembling lunches.   I got the French Quarter grain bowl. It comes with shrimp, brown rice, and avocado. It was a little heavy on the red onion -- I brushed my teeth when I got back to the office and I can still taste onion! The meal was around room temperature, which was fine but I feel like I may have enjoyed it more if the rice were warm enough to wilt my spinach. The portions are great, too -- the little box they handed me seemed small but my lunch left my pleasantly full without being weighed down.   For someone like me who lives gluten free, this place is very exciting; everything on the menu is naturally GF. It's so nice to not have to ask a million questions or risk getting sick because someone didn't change their gloves. I can choose anything here and feel like I made a smart decision.   I think Grabbagreen is going to enjoy success in Uptown. It's healthy and quick, and the employees are all extremely happy and pleasant.",

    "text": "Not impressed at all by this place. It seems very visually appealing and healthy and the staff was really nice, however, the food was meh. I had the Tokyo Bay grain bowl. The size of it was small, it was not even  warm which might be my mistake as I thought it would be hot. The ingredients did not seem very fresh and the salmon was not very good either, in fact, some pieces were really chewy. The dressing was also not what I expected from a ginger dressing. I sat outside and when I wanted some siracha or hot sauce, no employee was to be found. They are new, so more room for improvement, that's for sure. Let's hope the salmon won't cause me stomach issues.",

We ordered a salad with a mix of spinach and spring mix, shrimp and avocado.  The shrimp were well seasoned and delicious.  It went downhill from there. The avocado had oxidized with unappetizing brown streaks through it. At least half of the spring mix was slimy and inedible.  When I brought this to the attention of the worker, I got a shrug, a weak apology, and an explanation that the avocado was refrigerated therefore should be fine to eat.  Not acceptable!",

The woman also forgot my dressing, therefore I had a dry salmon and brown rice salad.  The prices are just too expensive for the portion size.  They also charge .75 cents for each additional veggie.  The box im eating should be $7.99.  The restaurant is clean and in a good location so I'm giving it 2 stars but will not be returning.  Food is good but value is bad.",

My favorite is the moroccan macaroni and cheese. And you can add on as many veggies as you'd like for an additional fee. Same with the juices. I usually take a base juice and will add in additional fruits and veggies to accommodate however I'm feeling that particular day.

Firstly, As soon as you walk through the door the strongest odor of cigarette smoke smacked you in the face. Now I can't say if that's because there's a cigar bar right behind the restaurant or whether somebody was smoking in the restaurant so I digress on that part. However, what I did observe is they both had their phones in their hands while actively making peoples orders. I watched one girl literally grab the salad mix with her hand that was just on her phone and make someone's food. I watched the other girl go outside with her gloves that she was currently using to make food and come back in and use the same gloves to continue to prepare food. I have never been so disgusted in my life.  I asked for a refund and left",

    "text": "I'm always looking for a salad here in Charlotte. It's harder than it may seem to find an actually healthy salad.   I was excited to try Grabbagreen because their ingredients sounded good and the bowls seemed like they would have great flavor. I was sadly wrong.   The pros: While service to order was slow- everyone working there was nice. The shop was clean too!   I ordered the French Quarter bowl which came with avocado, shrimp, red pepper, red onion, parsley, cucumber, spinach, mixed greens or brown rice.   I asked for mine without red onions and asked if I could have brown rice and mixed greens.   The bowls are really small (must be how the keep calories so low on their meals). I felt that the entire thing lacked flavor. Even with the avocado sauce which I was dipping bites into. Healthy doesn't mean flavorless - amp up the spice!!   Additionally, I had let the person at the counter know that I had an onion allergy and sure enough there was lots of cut up onion on my dish.   Ingredients seemed fresh enough, but the consensus amongst my lunch group was that we wouldn't be returning.   I'll have to come back to try a smoothie.   And so the salad search continues...",

    "text": "I've been here multiple times and always choose the \"grab your own\" bowl where you pick one base (grain or green), one protein, five nutrients (e.g. cucumber, beet, spinach, goji berry, etc.), one dairy, herb and housemade sauce. If you like to be creative, this is for you!!  Today, I changed it up a bit and elected for the Mediterranean Sea bowl, which consists of brown rice, chicken, cucumber, kalamata olive, mint, red onion, red pepper, spinach, feta, and Mediterranean pomegranate sauce. It was a perfect blend of different flavors, textures and colors. The entire bowl (which is quite large) is 523 calories. The only change that I would suggest is to mince the mint leaves rather than leaving them whole. This would allow for a more homogenous flavor in the dish.   There is a pitcher of water with orange slices available to customers for free! Definitely a perk of this place.   I love Grabbagreen's focus on high quality ingredients and they're push to add color to everyone's diet. I may be a little biased considering I have a nutrition background. :)",

Once we found it there was only one older dude working there so he said it would take 20-30 minutes for us to get our smoothies because it was \"backed up\" and his \"high school employee didn't show up\" lol. We weren't on a time crunch so we just sat outside and waited (btw there is no indoor seating it's basically a walk up counter where you order then you just sit at the tables and chairs outside, idk. The guy was friendly but it totally took 20 mins to get our smoothies then another 20 to get our salads, which were very small. I know it's supposed to be healthy portions and ingredients but my dad was pretty pissed at the portion size lol. Might be back but to a different location",

We couldn't believe that we were seeing a little girl make smoothies and food while a grown woman was \"coaching\" her. What happened to child labor laws? Unbelievable.",

There were several chunks of overcooked/dry brown rice that I bit down on and the flavor was just not there. Certainly healthy, but I can do way better at home so I'm extra motivated to start prepping my lunches now and bringing to work!",

    "text": "To be completely honest, I didn't love the food I had from Grabbagreen - it was almost a little too healthy! However, the gentleman who helped my friend and I last week was so wonderful, I wouldn't be able to give anything less than four stars. After mentioning our late night, he made some recommendations to get us back on our feet.   My friend and I both ordered the juice of the day, which had ginger, mint, lemon and, I think one other ingredient. It was not delicious, but I wasn't going for taste with this beverage - I was looking for a remedy! And I do feel the drink helped to deliver that.   We also both ordered the Gulf of Mexico salad, which has (copy/pasted directly from their website) \"Avocado, Cayenne, Cucumber, Egg, Green Onion, Parsley, Red Onion, Shrimp, Spinach, Creamy Avocado Sauce.\" Healthy? Heck yes! Delicious? Mehhhh. The shrimp were nicely seasoned and everything was very fresh, but the dressing didn't have any kick and the onions were overpowering.   All of this said, I really enjoyed the Grabba chili, which was a last-minute add. It's vegan and made with (again, copy/pasting here) \"Black Bean, Cilantro, Corn, Quinoa, Red Onion, Red Pepper, Tomato.\" It was unique and had a kick. I've actually been hoping to find a similar version back home in Philly!   I love the concept of Grabbagreen and I especially love that all of their nutritional info is readily available as well. Even though I wasn't crazy about some of my choices, I'd for sure give them another shot if I once again find myself in an area with Grabbagreen.",

    "text": "Portions are 30-50% smaller than they should be for the price. I made my own bowl and I thought that it tasted decent with the exception of the salmon. The salmon tasted like cat food; the texture, flavor and color were awful. Next time I'll just buy a can of Fancy Feast and glurp it on there... The quinoa was just bland, boiled quinoa; not noticeably seasoned or salted. It didn't add anything to the bowl except for \"filler\".   Suggestions: more flavor in the base ingredients   (don't rely on just the sauces for flavor). Take lessons from Moe's and Chipotle for portions. Run daily specials at a discount. Make the ordering process easier and faster. It took too much time to process the order. (Perhaps run the line through the ingredients bar similar to Subway, Chipotle, etc.) And for the love of god, don't make me go somewhere else for lunch after I have eaten lunch here!   This is the kind of food we need more of in Charlotte but this place needs some adjustments to be truly \"good\". I would love to see these changes made AND for them to add a location closer to my office in the NW side of the city such as Belmont or Gastonia.",

Are there other sweeteners added? Maybe it's just me...but I don't think it should have that much sugar and carbs. An apple only has about 20 grams of sugar.
