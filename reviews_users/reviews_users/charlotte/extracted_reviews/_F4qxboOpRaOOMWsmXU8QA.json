The seasonings on the grilled chicken are gifts from heaven, the chicken is moist and is served with a slice of lime.  The lime juice squeezed on the grilled chicken enhances the chicken even more.  I purchased a 3 piece meal which includes french fries for a little less than $9.  You can't beat the quality and the price.  By far, this is the best chicken I've ever eaten.  I used to buy fried chicken from the one of their competitors but no longer!  This is now the chicken spot for my family.",

The staples are the fried or grilled Chicken, with sides such as black beans, fresh corn salad or fries. I recently tried the chipotle chicken and verde empanadas. I LOVED the chipotle chicken, but wasn't a huge fan of the verde. I think that sauce is mayo based and I just can't. Lol! I had the black beans for a side and they were very good and tasted authentic. The place itself was clean, the staff was quick and friendly as well. Will definitely drop in again if I'm in a hurry and craving something different than your normal \"chicken place\"!",

I saw their Tv commercial and got my son interested in the food and he is picky and 6'4\" 225lbs so wants enough food to eat where he isn't hungry again in 2 hrs. The restaurant is spotlessly clean and we hope it stays that way. The food is Peruvian, spicy type chicken but they have grilled chicken, too. They have many yummy sides...black beans, campero beans, platinos maduro, coleslaw, many others and their flan, tho different than the Cuban flan I make, is EXCELLENT...my son likes it better than mine (I think they use condensed milk in addition to all the other flan ingredients. For him to be impressed it has to be A+++. We got the EMPANADAS plates, mine with slaw,  his with Campero beans. I got a guava drink that is to die for, tho a bit pricey.  We will be eating there more soon. I miss Cuban food, and this is similar...Peruvian food has a lot more cilantro in it, but it won't keep us away. I cannot wait to try the platinos maduros. WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, POLLO CAMPARO! Keep spreading the word via TV commercials, as I rarely go to that side of town any more and would've missed the restaurant had I not heard it on the tv.",

So I proceeded to try it. We had fried chicken, rice, fries and beans. I tried the beans first. They were a little soupy so I was not impressed...until I tasted them. They were extremely delicious! The best I had ever had. The fries were fries. Nothing different. The rice however was very delicious as well. Lastly, I tried the fried chicken. AMAZING. To be clear, the fried chicken tasted like no other chicken I've ever had in my entire life. Very flavorful! It was the very best chicken I've ever, ever tasted period. Better than Popeyes, better than KFC, and certainly better than bojangles. Better than any other chicken period! Their fried chicken looks very similar to KFC but tastes way better, and I do like KFC a lot. Again, I have not been to this restaurant but I can promise I will be going very very soon.

They offer empanadas, fried chicken (not too greasy or too battered) and traditional Peruvian chicken.

Almost an hour total. Other 2 times were takeout and it took 20 minutes each time for my order to be ready. How long does it take to put chicken, fries and rice in a box???",

The beans were super tasty and had a lot of seasoning; I actually drained the sauce off some and added it to a small salad to spice it up. I've had the empanadas and yuca fries from this place, but never had the actual chicken. They pride themselves on having hormone and antibiotic free chicken, and I definitely believe and appreciate it. The chicken, which we got hand breaded, was absolutely delectable. Lots of flavor, fried lightly, tender, and satisfying. As a cherry on top, they included a personal note, which I highly appreciated. I'll be ordering here again.",

The issue I have is the cost of the two sides. $7.00 for two sides - especially when one was only 1/2 full!  I may go back for the chicken but I won't get the sides again!",

The sauce which came with the empanada was delicious.  I could eat that with so many things.  The chicken bowl was a great size and really filled me up.  Plenty of cilantro and tasty black beans!  We were greeted warmly upon entering.  The service was prompt and food delivered to the table quickly.  An outstanding meal all around.  I so glad I read about Pollo Campero on yelp.

EVERYTHING was fresh and it truly does not feel like a greasy fast food place, you get REAL plates. Everything we had we enjoyed - the plantains (fried not greasy), the beans (so flavorful), the tortilla were not those overly thick kind it was soft and a manageable size. We are definitely coming back- if you are reluctant to try them out because it might be too \"ethnic\"- seriously a small fraction more cost wise as bojangles and Kentucky (who can't compare) you are getting your money's worth going to pollo campero.",

They weren't dry, which was a concern for me when I ordered them. They were crispy as advertised, but not oily or greasy. The rice was delish,  a healthy portion with cilantro, roasted corn and onions. The yuca was perfectly fried, again not greasy.  I'm looking forward to returning to try the fried chicken that most people ordered. Totally yummy.  I took 1 star of for the condition of the restroom. Totally gross. Considering the constant cleaning of the tables and floor I saw the staff doing, someone should venture into the restrooms once in a while.",

I was overwhelmed with the menu because I simply couldn't try everything. I ordered the Half Chicken special which includes both grilled and fried Peruvian chicken and choice of two sides (plantains and beans).  I also ordered one empanada which comes with shredded chicken and your choice of sauce... I picked the Guava BBQ which was delicious. The other choices are Latin Buffalo (spicy) and Peruvian Verde (house).  I also tried a fried chicken bowl which is their Campero rice, black beans and roasted corn topped with Rajas (thin fried corn tortilla strips).  They serve Horchata, guava juice and Tamarindo to drink or Pepsi products!  The atmosphere is warm and inviting as are the staff. I will definitely be back!",

Secondly, the food: We ordered the family meal with 3 sides, although it took 20 minutes to get most of our chicken , it was worth the wait .  12 piece citrus grilled chicken : YUM !  Cole slaw- pass... no flavor , and had green bell peppers in it (mortified) Rice - Delicious! Plantains- Oh yeah , get these ! Rolls- What were you thinking? Make some fresh ones . These were sad , store bought cheap rolls. Not even warm.   All in all, a nice fast service chicken spot with a bit of a Spanish twist .",

On my first visit, we went a little crazy. I had the empanada trio and am still dreaming about those delicious dough pockets of goodness. I got one of each of the chicken fillings offered -- buffalo, verde, and chipotle. They were all amazing but verde was my favorite, hands down. Full of flavor and fresh herbs. Yum!! As if that wasn't enough food, the empanadas come with a side. I went with yucca because, well, I love yucca. Insider tip... skip the red campero sauce it comes with and ask for the green sauce (cilantro lime) instead.   Ted ordered the 4-piece chicken meal that came with two sides. We got a mix of fried and citrus grilled chicken. As good as the fried was (and that's what they're known for) I actually liked the grilled better. Ted picked fries and plantains for his sides. The fries weren't anything special. But, I loved, loved, loved the plantains! I ate most of them, truth be told.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of the other menu items like the chicken bowls and intriguing sides like the street corn salad and campero rice & beans. Oh! And the aguas frescas!",

After having tried empanadas for the first time by a caterer who was Dominican, I must have been spoiled because these tasted nothing like the fresh ones I had before. I actually ended up throwing them away because I could not eat them. It may just be my palate, but I did not like the flavor of the ingredients they included and the dipping sauce did not compliment the flavors at all. I did give them two stars, because I got one piece of free fried chicken and that was pretty good. If I came back to this place, it would only be for their chicken.  Another note of improvement is their ordering process. I ended up getting my food after someone who had ordered after me. I was just one person and the family after me had 3 people in their party.",

The fried chicken was yummy, a bit on the greasy side but hey, it's fried chicken! The grilled chicken had a citrus marinade and was surprisingly moist - so delicious!! As for the sides, I would definitely recommend all of them except for the yucca fries. As a frequenter if Viva Chicken, I would say the yucca fries there are the best. The yucca fries here at Pollo Campero were too starchy for my taste. Overall, great service and very clean and modern atmosphere for its location. Will definitely be back!",
