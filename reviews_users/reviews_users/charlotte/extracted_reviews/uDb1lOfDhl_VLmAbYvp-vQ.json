I also love their large selection of can drinks...not many places you can get cherry coke or cherry Pepsi! Or Vanilla Coke! What what!  Nice parking lot too and easy to get in and out of! Always a plus in Charlotte...",

I don't know if the guy misheard my order but when I got to my car something told me to check my pizza and my order was wrong. I asked for 2 slices of pepperoni and 1 slice of sausage, I recieved 2 slices of sausage and pepperoni mixed. I politely went inside and said hey I think you heard my order wrong , I paid the difference with no problem. But as I'm waiting I'm watching the cooks throw the pizza around mumbling under their breath and shaking their head  I also heard him angry that they were gonna have to throw the previous order away, I would of kept it  ... I just wanted what I asked for corrected because I don't eat sausage (sausage slice was ordered for a friend) Much attitude ... when my order was ready the man kinda threw my box on the bar and walked away... I won't be back here .... and the pizza isn't even that great !  I was never rude, maybe they don't like black people.. lol but that's ok I know better pizza places!",

This pizza slice is the size of your face. Eat it with your hands! Fold it in half!   I get the cheese pizza slice, it's $4 and you can get full off of it. Perfect. And not only is the pizza the size of your face, it's very good too. Like genuinely good pizza. I love this place. I'll be back. and in the mean time I'll be trying to rationalize driving the whole way to NoDa for a pizza slice. :)",

No one came in until 5 mins later.... ALL of which (4 tables) got there food BEFORE us. I'm over Benny's. I gave another chance & came back despite being aggravated from the FIRST time! They are NOT sanitary! The workers drink BEER in the back room while making pizza! The pizza is good but this is unacceptable Benny's. Also, was very disrespected by \"Doc\" the man who worked the front today 11-8-2018 when I was there between 5PM-8PM (can't remember the timing). He was VERY rude from the start when I asked him what was on a pizza, he looked at me like I was stupid while giving me my answer! Also saying \"whatever\" to the things we genuinely had questions about & arguing with us on things we addressed from a previous visit. ARGUING & having attitudes with a customer isn't very work professional man. Morgan the manager made sure he addressed the issue with us, gave us a free slice card, & promised he'd fix things so thank you to him he calmed me down a bit. I'm just very upset with my visit more than anything from being disrespected than the wait AGAIN for my pizza.",

There are several tables inside, most of them large, but some of them are near the bathrooms. There are two picnic tables outside, but they're next to the parking lot. If you want to chill outside, go to the brewery next door.   Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",

But it looks like we'll still have to stick to BBQ. The pizza was fine. Definitely not bad.  I was just hoping for more.   The slice is huge, but more of average doesn't always equal great (i.e. The Golden Corral model...if I eat a stack of newspapers, I'll be full, GC, but that doesn't make the newspapers worth eating)  Also, you pay for the giant slice ($5), so it's not the greatest deal. *sips haterade*   and did anyone check out the price of a full pizza from Benny's?!?!.....I know it's NODA, but do you know how high I would have to be to order a $38 pizza from this place???...I mean...damn...a family of 12 could live off dominos for 5 yrs for that price.",

    "text": "So I've been coming here for about a month since a friend turned me on.  The pizza is really good but one of the staff members that works there always seems to have an attitude when I visit.  Look I get it we all have our bad days but seriously the last 3 times I've went in this dude is a total douchebag not to just the other employees but towards the customers as well.  Even my friend that was with me was commenting on how angry the employee was.  The last time after I got my food I wanted a ranch cup with it the same guy was working and he told me it would be 50 cents so I'm like sure.  I asked him for the ranch and the guy snaps back at me in a rude tone \"no he will get you at the register\" even though he's standing right in front of the fridge that has the ranch cups in them.  My food is getting cold and there was about 3 more people waiting in line.  So I go and sit back down to eat since I'm obviously not getting this ranch anytime soon.  I wait on the line to clear out and once again go up to pay for the ranch.  The guy at the register ends up giving me the ranch free which was cool but he has to wait for the rude employee to move out of the way of the fridge to even get me the ranch.  Like really they need to watch how they come off at me because next time I'm probably going to lose my cool and cuss you out for the disrespect.  Today I went in for some Joes Tea I asked the same guy how much the drink cost and the attitude starts.  There is about 5 people waiting to checkout so I ask if I can just leave the three bucks and go because I had an order to deliver so the employee with a bad attitude decides to yell back no you have to wait for him Pointing at the other guy running the cash register.  I'm livid at this point because I don't know who the hell you think you are talking to with that tone of voice.  It took all I had to not come across that counter.  I even asked you how you were trying to be nice and yet you still cop an attitude towards me.  I'm done trying to be nice so the next time I go if the same guy starts with the attitude I'm not letting it slide I will make a scene and give that attitude right back you.  You have to give respect to get respect with me and right now this guy is on my bad side.  If you don't like your job or don't want to work QUIT I know plenty of people who would love to have your job.  No need to come in and make everyone else's day miserable by being a total dick.  Keep that ass at home boy with that nasty attitude of yours.  I don't remember or care to know your name just know I know your face that's all that matters.  If the pizza wasn't so good I'd choose to go somewhere else.  Whoever he is please get him some proper customer service or hospitality training.",

    "text": "Terrible service, and mediocre pizza stored in dangerous, dirty conditions. My wife and I went to Benny Pennelo's for the first time at about 6:00PM, on a slow, rainy Friday.   Service--There were were between two and five employees behind the counter at all times, and no lines. Yet, no one acknowledged us. We first stood at the counter. Nothing. We moved to the counter and leaned on it, while trying to make eye contact with employees. They pretended we were invisible.  I moved and waited by the register. Still nothing. We wondered if we were supposed to seat ourselves. So, we sat at the bar and waited, and waited. Nothing! Finally, I walked over and gruffly grabbed the attention of an employee, who made it clear he didn't care. However, he did condescend to take our order.  Health Risk--while we waited, we saw them retrieve cold pizza from racks under the counter, just a few inches off the dirty floor. The pizzas were not in boxes or covered. Just exposed on baking trays. There was trash and dirt inches below the exposed pizzas. Workers' knees, shins, and hairy legs were grazing the pizzas. Their feet were kicking up dirt around and onto the pizzas. Brooms would have churned up dust on the pizzas if these guys swept.   The Food--My wife and I [stupidly?] tried the pizza anyway. The cheese and crust were perfect. Neither overcooked nor undercooked. Someone forgot to finish putting on sauce, and sauce was lacking by _any_ standard. The price was reasonable at $4.00 for each large cheese slice. The price for a whole pie was competitive considering the size. I almost gave Benny's a second star for how perfectly the owner(s) have the oven set up, but the filthy conditions prevent that.  Summary--The bottom line is the under-counter pizza storage area/bacteria farm is dangerous, and the employees drive customers away. Buyer beware! Walk around to the side and look under the front counter that is closest to the front door. If the pizza is still exposed by the floor, walk away. Mediocre food isn't worth the horrible service or the health risk. This is my first bad review of any place on Yelp, but Charlotte, beware!",

However, we ordered and then sat down on the opposite end of the bar where there was space to sit. When our pizza was ready, he shouted our name. I raised my hand, feet from him, and he said \"Come get your shit, I ain't bringing it to you!\". Come on, you HAVE to have better service. You could have had a gentle response if you didn't want to carry stuff 10 feet over.   All of that said, the pizza is fantastic, great crust and cheese.

Mostly because I didn't want to embarrass anyone with my extreme ability to consume pizza but that's a different story.   Slightly strange counter service type atmosphere but once you get the idea, it's a nice place to hang out. They offer some unique beers and a few domestics. It's not an easy place to get to on the weekends since the parking in the area is a challenge. If you are within a mile or two, I suggest you walk.   Really delicious, New York style pizza and I've had a few pizzas in NYC. Definitely comparable.",

With that being said it's obviously great pizza ; even great enough for me to tell all my friends and family about it. But for the first in like two years Benny let me down . I came in yesterday evening with my younger sister ... to make a long story short ; whoever the Post Malone looking dude is was making us uncomfortable. I don't know if he had an attitude all night or just when we walked in but he was slamming things and cursing under his breath but loud enough for me and my sister to hear him. Walking from he behind the counter and swinging the front door Wildly to leave (still while cursing) and even wilder to come back. Dude was just rude and his vibe didn't fit the atmosphere at all.   That was enough to make me not want to come back... ever. I know you all don't care about me (just one measly customer) ever coming back. But I loved Benny's it was my one chill spot where I knew I could come in super stoned and just enjoy my pizza in peace. And that blows.",

Honestly, I should have just ordered from a delivery service.  For one, the guys behind the counter were incredibly rude to me and other customers that came in. They never gave me my drink and when I asked after waiting 15 minutes for it, they ignored me. They also openly made fun of a girl who didn't know what the ordering process was.  Next, the pizza itself was not good at all. Yes, the slices are huge which is their \"thing\" but I'd rather get a smaller slice that is better quality. The dough was awful and salty while the cheese and pepperonis were bland and had no flavor (I tried each part individually trying to figure out why it tasted so bad).   The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because the interior was visually interesting with exposed brick and the music wasn't awful.  Other than that, this place just isn't worth it unless you want to watch frat boys turned hipster chug PBR and hit on girls that are so intoxicated they are falling off the bar stools.",

Although the slice was gigantic, as you can see from all of the photos, I had no issues finishing it!

They sell local craft beer and old school soft drinks in cans!! The pizza was phenomenal! A giant slice served on two paper plates. Hot, crispy on the bottom and delicious.

    "text": "Holy cow! I can say I was thoroughly surprised with the quality of the pizza here! Coming from a person who has been spoiled by New York pizza his entire life, I would have never associated Virginia with having a quality pizza slice. The crust was almost perfect, and the sauce/cheese ratio was just right as well. I like my pizza thin crust, not too much cheese, and full of fresh flavor. This pizza stepped up to that expectation. Only request I would have, is that they would be a little bit more generous with the toppings when ordered on a pizza. My Fiance ordered the Chicken Alfredo pizza, and wasn't very satisfied with the amount chicken that was put on there. Looking at the pictures seen on the Yelp page though, it seems it wasn't very consistent in person than it was in the pictures seen. Overall, this place has gained a fan! Did I mention that they serve craft beer, and they are open late?! I don't live in NoDa, and it is a little bit of a hike for me, but rest assured I will be back in the near future.",

So the toppings aren't integrated in the pizza.  For example, the garlic mushroom was a cheese slice with a pile of mushrooms (the slimy kind).  In addition, the mushrooms were only lukewarm.  I didn't order the BBQ chicken but I saw it and it looked like a cheese slice that had BBQ sauce and chicken on it.  In my mind, that's not what a BBQ chicken pizza is.",

It looks like the Charlotte location is actually going to make sure to do 1 vegetarian special as well as 1 meat special, not 100% on that though. The Charlotte location is also bigger than some of their other locations which is nice. It's super delicious classic pizza, a slice the size of your head... what's not to love?",

You can get a slice for $5 or a whole pizza for about $30 which I wouldn't recommend unless you have a larger group to feed. The whole size took up the whole trunk!",

My homie did tell me the flavor of my slice was off. I got cheese btw. However when I tried his man's slice, I still wasn't feelin it. Nope not for me!   But imma give them a second chance. Because orders were gettin mixed up, people couldn't hear there names being called, one guy left out with the wrong order, pizza dude trying to chase him down, pizza dudes and check out dude were shaking their heads with the amount of customers flowing through the door. It was too much going on.   I can't imagine this place being any different on a Saturday night after people have been drinking. All the greasy food joints are going to be packed. And they in NODA too where all these places around them are jumpin? Come on now.   I'll check them out on a weekday and see what they're talkin about.",

Big slices served piping hot remind me of the many divey pizza joints sprinkled like oregano all over the Northeast.  The pizza both smelled and tasted great; it also folded nicely and crunched oh so gently when taking a bite.  Mmmm . . . so good.  Ingredients were fresh, prices low, and ambience just the way I like it for fresh pie:  humble, divey, hipster, and cozy.  I say \"Give 'em a whirl!\"",

It's not to thin, not to thick and have a nice semi crunch to it.. which I seem to love. The sauce is not too much. And the ingredients are all good.   Why it's simple? They offered 4 basic pizzas...pepperoni, cheese, sausage, and garlic mushrooms. Then there's a monthly meat and monthly veggies. Those the the \"specials\" of the month. That's it.   You can't be a Starbucks customers here. Meaning you can't customize anything. What you see is what you get.. And for some reason I find this refreshing.. they don't do anything fancy., everything is served on paper plates. You order, they call your name, you pick up the slices. Self serve and bust your own table. Done.  They offered an awesome variety of can drinks. Local brewery to soda etc.   A nice cozy informal hang out spot with some good ole awesome pizzas..",

We tried to heat it up the next day and were only more disappointed. I really can't tell you what the issue is. Is it the sauce, the cheese or the crust? but the after taste is really bad. How can someone mess up pizza this badly!? Never going there again!  A waste of $30! So mad about that. If it were the usual $18 for a pie I would just keep it moving, but my god, 30!

Me and my 2 friends came in around 1230am and there were 5 people in the place. They were already eating. We each ordered 2 slices, bought 4 sodas, and sat down. As soon as we sat, a crowd came in. 15 min later, my 2 friends got 2 and 1 slice, my ticket and the other half of my friends ticket was not served. 20 people got their slices of pizza, after we asked repeatedly for ours for the next 30 mins. Finally, when I asked for my money back, the lady behind the counter hands me the last 2 slices sitting behind the counter. I felt so looked over and so disgusted by the way they ignored us repeatedly, promising our order over and over after serving everyone else that came in after us. I have never been a person to look at the color of skin, but I do feel that this was strongly a part of their decision not to serve me at all, and only serve half our other orders. I will never return, and being born and raised in Charlotte, this is a HUGE deal. God bless you.",

    "text": "Here we go. Okay...so you know how sometimes you will look up the reviews on a restaurant and pretty much everyone is RAVING about it? But then there are 1 or 2 people that say it is horrible...and you think to yourself \"well it's just those few people...the majority of people love it!\" so you try it out anyway and then wish you listened to those people? I'm going to be that person. Listen closely. To put it shortly for those that don't have the time to read a long rant: it's TERRIBLE do not go here! Go to Pure Pizza instead! It's only 10min away from this place and is amazing! Okay so for the rest of you here is my long rant. My husband and I went to go try this place yesterday (and before you think to yourself...\"oh they're probably just some old married couple with no sense of taste...we're actually 26 and 28yrs old), we got there around 4:45pm and no one was in there...which was to be expected during that time. We ordered our pizza (I got the buffalo chicken and my husband got the garlic mushroom) and then sat down. All of the tables were GROSS. It had a \"we're such a cool and hip place that we don't need to put any effort into cleaning\" type of vibe to it. This place just opened I think about a week ago...you would think they would put more effort into cleanliness. And like I said, it was dead during this time so there was no excuse for someone not to be going around and cleaning the booths and tables. There were about 6 workers here during this time. There was powdered cheese all in the crevices of the table as well as all in the booths, I had to wipe it down before I sat. Even after this I still had hope...I can look past those things if the pizza is amazing. So the pizza came and the slices are huge...but that's where the positives end. I could tell right away they used cheap and poor ingredients. The \"chicken\" they used on my buffalo chicken pizza had those fake grill marks on them, you know what I'm talking about. Also it was just a slice of cheese pizza with the \"chicken\" buffalo sauce mixture piled on top. Like...the chicken wasn't actually baked into the pizza. Same goes with my husbands slice. It was a slice of cheese pizza with the mushrooms just piled on top. Super cheap ingredients. Low quality cheese. To top it off I asked the girl for a side of ranch and she told me it would be 50cents. I thought this was super tacky considering we had already sat down. To make it better I tried the ranch and it was not homemade ranch! I paid 50cents for bottled ranch! Horrible place and I'll never go back. Pure Pizza is 10min away from this place and they have amazing fresh pizza. They use very high quality ingredients. They source everything locally and both their crust and sauce are made from organic ingredients. Do yourself a favor and go there instead. Yes they are more expensive but there's a good reason why. I'm sure this place will flourish anyway. People who think they are hip and drunks will keep this place alive. End rant.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while. As stated by others, the slices are HUGE. I ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. You pay and they call your name when your order is ready. Served on a paper plates, condiments on the counter and napkins for you to pick up. I think it's pretty legit pizza. The sauce is on the sweet side, the pepperoni creates just enough grease on the cheese but not too much. The crust is thin and crispy. I ordered an extra side of pizza sauce, perfect for dipping the crust in. I couldn't finish both slices but they sure were tasty. They only offer pizza, by the slice or whole pie as well as a few beers.  The dining area is pretty cool with a bar top and stools at the window looking out. There are also a few picnic tables outside.   Cool place-definitely check it out!!!",

We usually visit on Friday or Saturday around dinner time and even though the place is small, there's always somewhere for us to sit. I promise you one slice is enough. We got a whole pie once and couldn't eat it in a week, it's 30''! Had to put it in the trunk of my car! We eat for two for $11. Two slices, two sodas. We leave full! You really can't beat that!

    "text": "I decided to celebrate National Running Day yesterday by not running and going here to eat pizza instead. #amidoingitright  This place is right next to Heist. My friend Sammy, aka the pizza expert, has been talking about about Benny's for what seems like forever. He went to VA Tech, so he knew all about the Virginia slice concept.   The slices are the size of your head. Actually, they're bigger than your head. By the slice, it's $4-$5. It's so large that it needs two plates. As for the pie, it's 28\". TWENTY-EIGHT. I'm not even sure how they heave these things into the oven. Cheese is $30 and topping types $38.  I decided to get a piece of each monthly special, the buffalo chicken and the garlic mushroom. Did I need two pieces? No. Did I finish them both. Nope. Not even close. I love the crust. It's thin, crisp, and perfect.   This place just completely changed the late night scene in NoDa. Benny's is open until 2am on Thursdays, 3am Fridays and Saturdays, and midnight all the other days.   They just opened a couple nights ago, so they do have a few kinks to work out in the beginning. Pretty cool to see a King of Pops cooler right up at the front. Congrats and good luck Benny's! We are so excited to have you here.",

If you don't need the beer the price is 4-5 bucks a slice. So back to the point. The Virginia slice is literally the biggest slice of pizza you'll ever have. They serve it on two paper plate and it still hangs off the edge.   They have 2 specials every month as well as the basic toppings. I've never had a special that I didn't like. Everything is made right in front of you and you can choose to sit as a booth or table or at a bar. They even have a picnic table right outside for the nice days.   Located right beside Heist brewery this is an excellent stop while in NoDa. You can also order to go and be the hit of any party/tailgate by bringing a 30 inch pizza with you. Talk about an easy way to make friends. But seriously go check out Benny's",

They offer your basic cheese or pepperoni, and then have two special choices they rotate monthly. No beer/wine/liquor here, so don't come planning to throw back a Peroni with your pizza. Benny's is open late-night, so it's a sure-fire place to get your drunk-food fix after a night at Heist or Growler's. It's NY Style (to me) that's pre-baked, and then thrown back in to heat up upon your order. So if you love that, this is a great choice.   Sidenote: There are no sides/breaksticks/garlic knots offered, which was definitely a let down for me. I love me some breadsticks with my pizza. Literally just pizza and soda/water served here.",

I grabbed 3 slices, all different, all I think fairly priced for the size.   My impression on the taste? Very salty, but not horrible. Absolutely perfect place for stopping after a night out drinking. I would classify it as munchie pizza. I won't be going back unless i stumble out of Heist Brewery which is next door.",

However, the slice is the size of a small country. They only make 28' pizzas (ie: four times the size of a regular large pizza). One maybe two will definitely fill you up. They have a good selection of beer by the can and it's a very laid back atmosphere.   They have a pizza challenge, an entire pizza in one hour, I'm going to try to do it one day. Wish me luck.",

    "text": "I've heard about Benny's for a while now and their ginormous slices of pizza ( seriously 14\"!!), and decided to give it a try after 5 drinks deep at happy hour.   First of all, it's located right by heist brewery in Noda which is a perfect location! It's also open till 3am so it's great for that 4th meal. They do not have alcohol, but are planning to have it available within the next month.   The pizzas are premade (New York thin crust style), however they cook the pizzas with the toppings fresh each time. So be prepared to wait 5-10minutes. Slices range from $4-$5, but trust me 1 piece is enough. You can get two if you feel extra frisky. They also offer full pizzas (28 whopping inches!!) around $30-38 depending on the toppings. Pizza is the only thing on the menu so don't expect to get garlic bread, etc.   I tried the monthly special which was curry banana pepper.The pizza had good flavor, but I was expecting more. I was unimpressed with my choice. It was good, but nothing to rave about. The crust is surprisingly good- however ask for a side of sauce or ranch. It gets a little dry.   Keep in mind this pizza is New York style. If that's your thing you will love Benny's. For me this was more of a drunk food/late night kind of place. However I would like to return and try a different flavor. That might change my view on Benny's.   Overall, for the money, it's a great deal and you can never go wrong than pizza!",

When we got there, there was a small line but it moved quickly. This place just has the basics and I was okay with it. They have slices that start at $4 and go from there. They have dipping sauces (the garlic was clutch with the pizza), pop, water, and some beer. I decided on a pepperoni slice and garlic dipping sauce. The pizzas are already cooked and then they are reheated to order. Our order didn't take long to come up. These slices are literally two papers plates long. It's a v thin style crust, which is perfect for folding in half and eating it NY style. Honestly.. everything was good about my slice of pizza. It had a wonderfully crispy crust, melty cheese, and just enough grease to make it a good pizza! As I'm typing this review, I kinda wish I could just walk over to Benny's and grab a slice for breakfast...lol but seriously, go check this place out for a late night bite(s). You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "***UPDATE 8/16/18***  Previously I had given Benny's 2 stars based on my experience but after my tip issue was resolved, I can add back another star. I have added the email conversation between the owner & I and it seems as though the employee adding extra tip was unintentional. Hopefully the phone usage will be greatly reduced. I understand it's not always busy and you want to check your phone once in awhile but you're still on the clock and should still be paying attention to customers.  I'll still be back because the pizza is that good.  Original Review  Last Monday night around 11 PM, I had a pizza craving and wanted to check out Benny's. LA and I decided since it was pretty close to closing for the night that we would check it out the next day. So we did!  I stuck with their cheese slice and LA wanted a meat lovers slice. There is no meat lovers pizza on their menu but they were able to make one by adding additional toppings ($1 each) to their monthly meat special. So LA got a slice of the Bacon Cheeseburger with sausage and pepperoni added to it. It took about 10 minutes for the pizzas to come out and they did not disappoint! Huge slices, deliciously crispy crust, and a generous amount of toppings on the meat lovers slice. My only complaint about the pizza was I wish there was a little less sauce and more cheese, but that is my personal preference. I read some other reviews stating that one slice would make you full or whatever, but since I'm now eating for 2, I definitely felt like I could've eaten another slice and then be satisfied. We decided to order a couple more slices to go but this is where the problem starts..  I got up to the counter to order more pizza but the dude working (different guy from the one who initially helped us out) was more interested in playing with his phone than paying attention to customers. I decided not to say anything and see how long it would take him to realize I was standing there. I probably waited a solid couple of minutes before he looked up and saw me. He quickly apologized and took my order. It came out to $11 and I left a $2 tip (18%) though he didn't even deserve 10%. I remember writing very clearly $2.00 and $13.00. He asked me if I wanted a receipt to which I replied no and that was it. Pizzas were ready in about 10 minutes, and LA and I went back home, after running a few errands.   A few days later, I had checked my bank account and saw a posted transaction from Benny's that was $14.00 when it should have been $13.00. Now, I'm not mad that I lost a dollar but it's just the principle of the matter. Employees adding more tip than what the customers write down is shady AF, plus the service I received wasn't that great to begin with and he was lucky I left anything at all. Apparently my 18% tip wasn't good enough and he thought he deserved 27%, idk?  I'll still be back because the pizzas are good and they are open late. However, I will be paying cash from now on and I'm sorry but unfortunately I feel less inclined to leave a tip because that was pretty lame of you Benny's.  TL;DR 4 stars because the pizza is good and they are open late 1 star because customer service isn't great and some employees add more tip than what the customers write down If you pay by card, ALWAYS ask for a receipt or just play it safe and pay with cash",

    "text": "This is a place that is different from normal pizza places.  They have a limited number of choices for toppings and sell huge slices of pizza.  The price of whole pizza are priced high enough that unless you have a large group that wants the same topping, you are best to get it by the slice  I got the cheese because that was the only topping that I liked. The pizza is good, but I live in an area that has the best pizza in the country. It also has the topped rated pizza restaurant in the country ( Frank Pepe), so it's hard to give this place 5 stars if I compare it with that I get back home.  The reason for my rating is that this place lacked choices for topping and it's oven is not hot enough ( coal or wood brick oven) to blacken the crust.  However the crust is very thin, which I like. Also the restrooms were not the cleanest.   However for North Carolina Pizza it's very good.  They also play oldies , which I love.",

The pizza was ready pretty quickly and being the ranch connoisseur that I am, I ordered 2 cups extra.   The pizza was HUGE and delicious! They also have a pizza contest running: whoever can eat and entire pie wins $500! I highly doubt I could even come close to doing that but I'd like to see the person who would",

We were at jack beagles originally which is a few blocks away and boyf was getting haaangry so we asked around of a place that we could quickly get him something and be back to the party without anyone noticing and in time to pay our tab before everyone left. They recommended this place for the shear size of the pizza slices and the convenience. When we got there, we stood in line for about 5 minutes then he finally ordered and literally only got one slice of cheese pizza. We sat down and waited for them to call it, we weren't sure If we were supposed to be sitting down or if we were supposed to be standing out by the counter it seem like there were a few people doing both so that aspect is a little bit confusing. We started to get impatient after waiting like 10 minutes, then started to get annoyed when The people who came in behind us were getting served before us with bigger orders. The interior is cute and the food is good but I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to get in and out quickly.",

I recently ordered 2 slices to go which were conveniently placed in a box that would fit a large pizza at some other chump sized pizza store. The box did a great job protecting my food, but when I got home I realized my cats couldn't stay away from the box. They've been sleeping on it for about a week now with no end in sight. I did some experiments to better understand if they just liked the shape of the box, or just like defined spaces (see attached photo) but every time they go straight to the box. It's pretty neat.",

Most people can definitely eat one slice, but if you attempt for 2nd - I guarantee you won't finish it.   I have been utilizing Benny's for our work functions. I order 12 whole pies for work and every time it is a hit at work. While they don't have a big variety of pizzas compared to national local chains, what they do make is pretty awesome. They change up their specialty pizzas by the month I believe.    Whatever kind of sausage they use, it's big round flat slices of it and pretty tasty. But my preference is their Garlic Mushroom Pizza. It's so freaking good. It was that pizza that makes me such a fan. It is perfect. They also make the dough themselves and you can taste the difference.  They have only limited space in their oven so depending on your order - it could take a while.

    "text": "We ordered four slices;  pepperoni, mushroom, Buffalo Chicken(monthly flavor), and Garlic Mushroom (monthly flavor). Slices are $5, but are about 2-3 normal-sized pizza slices. A large pizza w/toppings  is $38 but is ridiculously large. I finished A single slice and was stuffed.   My favorite part of this pizza is that it's crisp on the bottom. No soggy sad pizza here : )  My one big disappointment was the canned mushrooms. You're better than that Benny.   Just a reminder to those who need it, this place is a pizza joint. Pizza has dough. Dough contains Gluten. Probably not the best choice for someone who has an intolerance of this nature. To give a poor review because they make a dish with a main ingredient you're allergic to is kind of crappy. That would be like someone with a lactose intolerance expressing dismay at an ice cream parlor .. you mean they serve dairy with lactose here? --shocking. Just my opinion. I think sometimes our expectations are a bit over-inflated especially because there are a lot of places that do cater to allergies...which is certainly nice, but shouldn't be expected.",

Seriously, I spent part of the time while I was waiting for my pizza just staring at the one in the back.   Anyway, on to the star of the show - the pizza. I really enjoyed it. It was like flatbread and New York style pizza had a baby. All of New York's size and strength of character, refined with a more crisp crust, less sauce, and higher end ingredients. All of the flavor with much less greasiness.   My girlfriend got the pepperoni pizza and it tasted like a more sophisticated, less greasy take on the classic pie. They offered a bunch of pizza toppings, from hot sauce to onion to some kind of oil, so she added parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. I tried one of the two special monthly flavors, bacon jalapeno. The bacon was thick cut strips of real bacon and the jalapenos added a little kick and flavor without actually being overly spicy. I chose garlic powder and parmesan for mine, which elevated its flavor even more.   I love that there's a late night option so convenient to NoDa. I'll be sure to check them out again after a late roller derby practice. :)",

There was one issue that really put a damper on my first time experience there. The music was so loud that the 4 of us had to yell at each other from across the table in order to hear each other talk. It wasn't typical music that you would expect to be listening to in a restaurant. This was the type of \"music\" where the person is screaming instead of singing and you expect to find a mosh pit nearby. I guess it would have been a little more bearable if the volume at which it was played didn't give 2 if us a headache. I will say that the couple that invited us said that this is the first time that they have went there and had such experience with the music. I had thought about asking one of the employees up front to turn the music down a little but he was really into it with his head bouncing up and down to the beat. I thought on second thought that I just wanted to hurry up and get out of there. I would have given this place a 5 star rating had it not been for the horribly loud, obnoxious music and the headache.",

Benny's was a bit out of the way but certainly well worth it. The place had a cool vibe and you just ordered at the counter and then took your seat. I was a little skeptical at ordering just one slice...but wow they were HUGE.   Overall it definitely lived up to the hyped. Not quite 5 stars...but for the South it's about as good as it's gonna get.",

    "text": "When my girlfriend and I drove to this place, we saw that the parking lot was completely filled and there were people standing outside.  I thought that would mean that this place was so hopping that there was not any room except for outside the place (room we would have gladly taken).  Upon entering the establishment, however, we realized that the energy that was emanating was coming from the brewery next door.  This place was definitely way more low key.  As we do in most new establishments to us, my girlfriend and I were going to take our time taking it all in and reading the menu, deciding all of our options and making the best meal possible.  The cashier, however, seemed incredibly expectant that we order immediately, for the menu must have been simple for him and it therefore should have been for us.  I was not necessarily held up on the amount of choices, but rather the price.  $4 for a slice of cheese pizza is outrageous, I do not care how big or good it is.  When I finally decided that I would try this place's food, just in the spirit of being adventurous, I ordered two slices of pizza, two drinks, and a dipping sauce.  The entire process involved a lot of uncertainty, now on the part of the cashier and not me, for everything I was doing seemed to be wrong.  He took our name, and when the pizza was ready, I was called up to get it.  Upon returning to my table, I realized that the order had not even been completed correctly, for I was missing my dipping sauce.  Upon asking for it, I received a garlic sauce that had been purchased from somewhere and was nowhere close to the quality I was expecting when I paid for an extra sauce.  The pizza is nothing special, honestly.  So what if it is as big as a baby, or as big as a head, or whatever you wish to say?  The crust was dry and crunchy, and there really was not much cheese on the pizza at all.  I like my cheese chewy, but not because there is barely any on the pizza.  I felt like all I was paying for was the phenomenon of it being a large slice of pizza, and for someone who is not interested in falling victim to marketing, it was nowhere near worth my time.  The attempt of the physical environment (possibly artsy?) ended up making the place look like it was completely falling apart.  I do not know what kind of person would enjoy the appearance of that place. My girlfriend noted that there is a better pizza place she knows about, where it will most likely be cheaper.  This is the type of place that expects a certain behavior from you.  That is the reason why I do not particularly like going in Chipotle, for, as I have always said, they treat you like a burrito.  They expect for you to come there knowing immediately what you would like to order, even though that is nearly impossible on the first time.  They expect you to play along with the way that they act towards you, and they expect for you to have a good time, enjoy the pizza, and leave wanting to come back.  The employees seemed incredibly wrapped up in themselves, and I am pretty sure that they failed to realize that their service was what would have led me to like the place more (even though the pizza is not the best).  The cashier did thank us on the way out and tell us to come back, but by then it was too late.",

Not knowing what to expect, I strolled in here thinking this would be one of your typical southern pizza joints that make a good cardboard and ketchup pie with some wacky toppings- Not. The. Case.   After taking a quick glance at the menu, I was drawn to the Curried Banana pizza. Sure, I'll try it, why not. I ordered just a slice as I wasn't terribly hungry. Little did I know how big these pizzas were. I've seen my share of large NY style pies, but this had to be THE largest. It's just stupid big. The to-go boxes can barely fit out the door. Love it.  The pizza itself had a great flavor, really enjoyable. And as you would assume, even though I wasn't really hungry, that didn't stop me from finishing the monster slice. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out their other recipes.  I LOVE that this place is here in Noda, it really fits well with the theme and atmosphere. Good stuff all around. GET THAT BEER IN HERE!!",

The pizza was as good as I was told it would be. Classic. Not too greasy, good texture on the crust-I especially enjoyed how there was a slight crisp on the bottom. I got ranch on the side for $0.50.  The sat at the bar and enjoyed my slice while looking into the kitchen as dough was weighed and kneaded.   I'll definitely be back!",

The pizza was pretty good although it's very big it's think crust with still as big crust at the end to dip and eat as you please. Definitely worth trying this place at least once I'm just not the biggest fan of an overtly large slice of pizza. Also this is very affordable!!",

Baked-through crust with no soggy center, foldable at the edge and supportive to the end like a friend ought to be. Toppings stop short of the edge giving a clean, dry lip for holding and folding and nibbling when you're done with the cheesed over part; sauce is medium bodied and pizza-y, cheese is up to the task of holding the toppings in place without making a pest of itself and the toppings are sufficiently flavory that sauces and sprinkles are not required to enhance the basic eatability, still, dry condiments are available: peppery pepper, shake cheese is smelly but not rank, garlics are as advertised, and the red pepper sauce tastes of peppers not fire. yea, giant slab of above average pizza!",

Honestly, I don't know what I was expecting when I came here...we were diving through Charlotte and this place was open later than most places, but by the fate of Yelp reviews, we found this amazing place.   Now, my fiance and I LOVE pizza. This has to be one of the best places we've been to in a long time. Not only are the slices GINORMOUS, but the quality is really solid. They were large slices, not once were they soggy or cold! That's saying a lot. I got the fiesta chicken (yumsssss and totally recommend) & the fiance for the sausage. We also got a side of garlic dipping sauce (super clutch).   Definitely check this place out (& grab a beer next door!)",

In Savannah, GA, it used to be Sweet Melissa's. I'd looked all over Charlotte to revive my youth - at last, I've found you.... Benny.  Lrg slices of pizza for $5? Steal deal! Classic casual restaurant to hang out with friends or reserve it for a cheap date. The pizza topping combos are limited, and occasionally varies daily. You can count on the classic cheese and pepperoni to be a standard. Once the varieties are gone, that's a wrap. Which I like, but there are other days I wish I could switch it up.   If you're ordering a full pie, you can create your topping combo just don't get too crazy - it's limited. Aside the slices, you can expect cheap sodas and good locally brewed beer options. Win win for beer and pizza lovers.   My second favorite is the art in the space. I like the art posted is for sale and I look forward to seeing the new canvases in the space. Restrooms were eh. Music was cool. My glory college days have been revived!",

Benny's sells pizza by the slice and by the pie - but don't think that you're going to eat your regular number of slices here.  The pies are 28\", which means a slice has to use two plates.  Its a bit ridiculous.  Its New York style pizza, thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  I've only tried the cheese and pepperoni, but they do have other toppings as well.  Benny's is a great NoDa addition, they have some awesome murals on the walls (and front of the store), and it will be a great stop if you're headed out to a brewery or two (or three!).",

It is located literally right beside Heist. It is open very like on the weekends. Like 2am or 3am. I can already tell this new found place is going to be a problem in my life!  As they are fairly new, they don't have their beer selling licesnse yet but are working on it. I ordered the monthly special- queso chorizo and my hubby ordered the monthly special- curried banana peppers. When the slices came out, they had to use two plates each cause the slices were so large. Like, picture holding a slice of pizza up to your face and then adding a few inches at the top and bottom!! One slice was waaaay more than I needed. The queso chorizo was absolutely freaking amazing! Had a bite of the curried banana peppers and, being someone that doesnt really like curry alot, loved it.   Good luck Benny's! We will be back!",

Just to throw it out there I'm not the biggest pizza fan , it's defintely not my #1 must have food, but if I do crave it , it's usually a deep dish. This pizza definitely is quite large for a slice so I think that appeals to a pizza lover , but it lacked in sauce and hearty toppings . There was dipping sauces you could purchase , and we opted for the marinara .  I liked the monthly special and combination of jalapeno and bacon but it was a little too thin and crispy for my taste buds, I felt like it was close to the consistency of a flatbread  vs. A pizza slice . I think if you like that really crunchy, thin crust pie texture,  then Benny's is your spot .",

They sell 14\" slices and 28\" pies. I was full before I even finished my slice. Other sauces they offer for dipping are marinara and garlic sauce.  They have monthly specials, so that will keep me coming back to try all the delicious combinations they come up with.  If after eating your pizza you are craving something sweet, you can grab a King of Pops Popsicle to curb your sweet tooth.  Benny's does not deliver, but they are open late night 7 days a week.",

There isn't much to this place inside other than a couple busted booths and a bar area.  Still, it works big time.    One awesome thing is the Benny's Challenge.  If you eat a full large pizza in one sitting you win and get a $500 check from them on the spot.  Don't get too excited and start counting the money too early.  We did the math and the large pizza is the equivalent of four large pizzas from a Papa Johns in area.",

That being said, the service the past two times I've been has been absolutely dismal. I'll echo what other reviews say, there is one employee (male, long hair, wears a hat) who made me feel absolutely unwelcome and like my mere presence in the restaurant was an annoyance to him.   I came here hungry, sober, with cash in hand (and I tipped for my two slices to go) and I STILL felt unwelcome. There's plenty of other places in town who serve pizza without the attitude. Seeing as the business keeps putting this employee on the register despite multiple customer complaints, I fear this is all falling on deaf ears.",

It's a cool pizza spot and a great compliment to the NoDa area.  I have had pepperoni, mushroom and sausage pizzas and combinations of those toppings. All good. Also one slice is usually enough for most. However, I have found myself wolfishly eating two. Not a lot of extras, but that's what is cool about it. Just good pizza. You can get a few other stuff, but honestly the pizza's size and quality are all you need with a drink (alcoholic or not).",

They serve pizza by the slice that is absolutely huge! They call it the Virginia slice as they are originally from that state. The crust is chewy like NY style pizza. The cheese and toppings are sufficient. The slices are $4 - $5 each.   They are open Sunday to Wednesday until midnight, Thursday until 2 AM and Friday and Saturday until 3 AM. As expected they can get very busy at times. They are normally pretty efficient, however. As a bonus you never know who or what you're going to see in this place - especially late!",

Everyone was friendly and welcoming. This place could definitely receive five stars, but a great amount of the tables were noticeably dirty. It wasn't busy when we arrived, so there's no excuse for that.   Seems like a nice spot for a chill day. They have your local beer too! I don't drink beer, so I can't speak on that lol.

I've had Benny's in Blacksburg, VA and I've had it in Charlotte. Pretty much the same thing!  Prices are fair and the pizza is good. Could the place be a little cleaner? Sure. Could the staff be a little more courteous? I guess so. But Benny's is what it is and if you don't like it, you can always order delivery from somewhere else.  Don't ever change, Benny's.",

    "text": "So last week a coworker was raving about this pizza place somewhere in NODA and mentioned the pizza was a little on the large side.   I would like to consider myself a little bit of a pizza enthusiasts and had to search out this little hidden gem.  For starters, there is only one size of pizza - you guessed it? It will not fit in your car....I had to bring the Expedition.  It literally had to be tilted sideways to fit in the passenger seat. ( too much stuff in the back).  I can see why they do not deliver, because the boxes barely fit through the front door of your home.    This is a good pizza, I had the plain boring cheese pizza, but what a pizza........(where was this concept when I was in college?)  Do yourself a favor and if you want to impress your friends, buy a pizza and deliver it yourself.  They will be talking about this for days.  Kudos to Benny Pennello's.",

One slice takes up 2 plates, so be prepared for a huge cheesy slice of deliciousness. They change their 2 speciality slices monthly, so keep an eye out for their new options (other than cheese and pepperoni). Oh and their garlic butter dipping sauce is pretty bomb too.  And finally for us Charlotteans, Benny's carries King of Pop popsicles....so save room for dessert!  In response to some other reviews: -Don't be deterred by the $5/slice for their specialty slices because Benny's is worth every dollar.  -Parking lot may be full, but Benny's shares a lot with the brewery, so don't let the lack of nearby spaces change your mind. I've never had to wait in line to order before.",

I have to admit I'm used to NY's pizza and NY's Pizza prices . I didn't expect to pay the same as a NY slice  but not 5$ either . So yea , I was a little shocked to see that it was 5$ a slice .  I'm pretty sure the pizza place at the epicenter isn't 5$ a slice but anywho... Despite the price , the pizza was good enough even though I'd probably only buy 1slice at a time . I just couldn't see myself buying 2/3slices at a time . After saying all that, if I was in the mood for late night pizza I'd definitely   swing by again due to convenience and availability . So I guess that breaks down to  a decent slice + late night availability +convenience =5$  Also side note, I think the mushrooms on the  pizza my friend had were canned which is no bueno. Canned mushrooms are never ok ..",

I heard some great things about the Buffalo Chicken pizza so had that set in my mind. But little did I know I would be a bit disappointed. So Benny's only offers pepperoni & cheese slices and then two monthly specials. (Buffalo Chicken was only offered the month they opened.) This month (Oct) the specials were Smoked Pork and Spinach& Feta. Even tho I was set on Buffalo Chicken I decided to stay & try it out. And when I say I'm glad I did! The smoked pork pizza was soooo good! At first I was taken back that I couldn't get any other toppings but that pizza needed NOTHING else! It was perfect the way it is! And they offer the Virginia big slice so one slice is definitely enough. I also had a great beer to wash it down called Estrella (And I'm not a big beer drinker.) I really do love the concept & will definitely try to be back each month to try the monthly special bc you can't go wrong with pizza & beer!",

Nothing is worse than wasting my cheat meal on hot garbage so I take it pretty seriously. I was in the mood for pizza. Whenever I want to try a new place, I check out the Yelp reviews first and I stumbled across Benny's. The reviews and pics were so awesome I had yo try it. And I'm so glad I did! I went on a Friday night around 8ish. I expected it to be crowded but it wasn't. Here's my humble review....  --Pizza - Incredibly huge slices (see my pic and no it wasn't \"enlarged to show detail\" the slices really are that big)! Thin crust. Delicious, local, fresh and piping hot fresh out of their big ole oven. Nothing like a chain. Go hangry and you'll leave very satisfied.  --Atmosphere - Laid back, chill, groovy background music. Order your food at the bar then sit wherever you like. Diverse crowd which was great.  --Staff - Super attentive. Checked on me a couple of times during my visit and I love that.   --Drinks - They only had beer which is great for beer lovers but I'm a vodka girl. Nonetheless, I wanted to sip on something other than water so the sweet server chatted with me to get a sense for what I might like. She recommended an apple cider beer and it was on point! Again, I love the staff.  --Parking - Dicey. Even though Benny's wasn't crowded, it's next to Heist Brewery which was packed. I guess I had good parking mojo that night b/c I landed a spot smack dab in front of the joint.  -- Last Words - Pizza lovers, you should def check this place out. I've never had pizza in New York, but I imagine this has to be pretty close? You decide.....",

Obviously, after a night of drinking, I love pizza even more! I really like the fact Benny's is a \"NY Style\" pizza joint. Is it the best NY Style pizza that I've had outside NY? Nope. But they get an A+ for effort and coming extremely close. Thin slices, good amount of sauce, good crust...  Back to the slices. They are ridiculously big. I know a lot of people out there pride themselves in claiming they can eat a whole entire pizza pie (in which they are usually referring to dominoes or papa johns, etc.)   I can bet ANYONE a meal at Benny Penello's, that you have a ZERO percent chance at finishing 3 of their slices. I would even say there's a slim chance at finishing two slices, but I was actually able to pull that one off myself (I blame the night drinking and no dinner lol).  Anyways, make sure you check this place out. It's conveniently located right next door to heist brewery. If you like Pizza, you wont be disappointed.   Come hungry, order once slice and then leave happy.",

They sell t-shirts that say, \"Can you handle our 28 inches?\" Saw the box that the full 28 inch pie fits in, it is the biggest pizza box I have ever seen!   We both ordered a slice of the Garlic Mushroom, and a ranch dipping sauce. The ranch was very good, definitely above average. The slices came out about 10 minutes after we placed our order, and we used the small station at the front to get our red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese. It took me a while to get through mine and still could not finish. When I asked if I could have a to-go box, I got handed a brown paper bag which I thought was a little odd. It ended up working out since I could just put my remaining pizza slice between the 2 paper plates they are served on, and then put that in the bag. So no worries there.  Tap water is served in a cooler directly behind where you order. They also have a cooler full of bottles and cans of beer and soda. Noticed they carried some harder-to-find sodas like Tab and Squirt. Was asked if everything was good before we left, and said it was. All in all, enjoyed the experience!",

    "text": "A pizza generally comes down to three things, cheese, sauce, and crust. You can have deep dish, pan pizza, square pizzas, whatever shape or size; your satisfaction generally comes down to the quality of the cheese, sauce, and crust. The size is largely irrelevant, other than a novelty.  The cheese is the worst and leaves a weird processed after taste in your mouth. The sauce is flavorless and dry. The crust is ok (hit or miss), although it has improved slightly since they originally opened.  There are so many pizza places in Charlotte that do a better job, granted costlier. I guess if you are wasted and just need something to soak up alcohol, Benny's will do. Otherwise, it may be better to eat actual pizza from places that don't try to sell you by the novelty of the size of their pizza, but by the quality of the product.",

These pizza was so big that it needed 2 paper plates to be contained.   I love thin crust pizza, but hate when it gets all floppy and hard to manage.  Luckily, this was not the case here.  Their crust was thin and crisp so it was not floppy, but also not so crisp that it turned to crumbs whenever taking a bite.  We will definitely return here!",

And the nice combination of a great crispy crust combined with a huge slice is perfect after enjoying some of the nearby craft breweries.  The sauce was not particularly memorable, but when you buy a slice it's all about that crispy crust.  Instead of being dense, tough, and chewy, the crust has a perfect snap with a light airy texture.  Just what I like in a re-heated slice :) I really appreciate the simplicity of the concept.  You can order a giant pie or a giant slice.",

He told me that he could not turn the television on because there were people sitting there. (Remote control, doesn't everybody use that) he then told me he would turn it on after they left, but he didn't.  Worst experience, people really don't go out of their way to please u.

Nothing against the extracurricular activities, just maybe a little less before serving me my lunch would make the whole process easier. ;)  Overall, it was delicious, and they have an awesome beer selection too. Literally all they are is a pizza joint, and I think they should keep it that way. While I do love salads, etc with my pizza, sometimes simplicity is bliss. :)",

    "text": "Great place for after bar hour pizza.  Left a local bar and was in desperate need of something good, greasy & quick. New to the NoDa area and I've seen this place a few times and their the first place that came to mind. The place was pretty busy with locals so that was a positive sign. Having moved from NJ/NY I'm use to a $1 pizza spot so not really expecting much. The pizza here is average but man the slices are huge. I've page $4 a slice for a cardboard pizza in NY and it's a basic slice, this place the slices are HUGE and good drunk food. The whole pie goes into a box that doesn't fit well out the door. Again nothing special about the pizza but they have a nitch with the pie & slice sizes which I was wow'd about. Could have been the alcohol since I was taking pictures with other folks pizza but it was fun. I'll definitely come back again but note to self, I only need one slice lol.",

    "text": "The pieces o'pie are HUGE! $5 average so it's worth it! However, there are some flavor challenges. I ordered Chicken Bacon Ranch and eh, it was just okay. My daughter ordered the cheese and she didn't care for it either. I like that the crust is thin! I like how much pizza you get for the money! Flavor wasn't horrible but it definitely was a little lackluster! I like flavor, especially if you're going to go outside the norm with CBR or even the Mushroom Pesto posted. It was kind of uninviting when we entered. No greeting or acknowledgement! When we were ready to order we had to ask if we could. Dude had a chip but oh well. We ordered then grabbed a seat at the bar. He didn't give us our drinks so we had to ask do the drinks come out with the pizza or nah. Dude had a chip, no acknowledgment, just sat beers down on bar. Pizza was done, dude sat pizza on to go counter instead of in front of us then pointed at it. Wow! This kid has issues clearly soooo...BEST part of the visit was the music! Old school rap and R&B! Plus, the guy who took and filled my order for a second beer was super friendly and knowledgeable about the Wicked Weed out of Asheville. He was cool! Not too sure I'll return to Benny's but it's not because of the kid with the chip.",

I love the NoDa area...you can always find the most interesting places.   So my father, the pizza  connoisseur selected 2 slices. Ummm that's a LOTTTT Of pizza!!! I was hesitant at first....Im assuming the pizza slices are stored in a refrigerated area or something. I didn't see any pizza sitting out in the open (comforting) I've gotten sick once before from pizza sitting out to long.   I decided on the Monthly special (bacon, some other pork) Amazing of course! Oh and a Beer! Perfect combination!!!! My parents both had the Mushroom and Sausage pizza....Dad ate 2 slices. Everything was great, oh and there was no wait! If you don't know already. The slices are 28inches...4 slices cost $30...I think someone got additional toppings. Slices \"as is\" are $5 I think. Hope everyone has a chance to stop by here!!!",

You can't beat that big slice of pizza for just five bucks!  The place is pretty unique. The vibe ~ it feels like I was transported back in college days. It has a touch of industrial feel with a cool exposed brick on the wall. The pizza ~ reminds me of  Brooklyn pizza in NYC chewy and tasty.",

With a varied, yet not overwhelming choice of soda and beer to round out your meal, plus a bare bones layout, this is a nice, no frills, low key place, which I personally like. Definitely check it out.   *slight exaggeration, it was only 1/2 the size of my car",

I went in the afternoon around 2pm.  There was plenty of parking and no wait at all. I've heard that people frequent this place mostly at night after leaving the brewery next door lol. I ordered a pepperoni slice. It was $5 which was decent. Honestly it's probably the biggest slice over ever had. It took up two plates! The wait wasn't long either. I probably waited 5 minutes or so. There was nothing that I didn't like about the slice. Huge, not too greasy and it had a nice crisp to it. Even though the slice was bigger than most it was no match for my hunger. I finished it all! There were other choices like cheese and they had a special for spinach and artichoke that was pretty tempting but pepperoni is just so classic. Next time I will definitely try another slice. Maybe I'll come in the evening and see how it compares. Either way great pizza and great staff. Must try!",

    "text": "One of the Worst Customer Service Experiences Ever! We often go out to eat at many different places for new experiences. I've dropped in Benny Pennello 2 other times to grab a slice on my way home from work and was very pleased with the pizza. We were in the area at a Network Event with my husband and decided to grab a slice of pizza and eat it dine in. My husband has never been here before so I was excited for him to see how large the slices were! I don't think the worker in picture below knows how to handle the non drunk guest very well. We ordered and told to have a seat and that's what we did. We sat down at the bar so we could see them make the pizza pie because I was fascinated by how large they really were. Not to mention they were NOT BUSY AT ALL! When our pizza was ready yelled our name than looked over at us instead of just handing it to us. No big deal husband got up and grabbed both our slices. Once he brought it back it was burnt tasting and also looked burn on bottom. I asked Nicely if we could get two different slices, comment was \"I've been working here 2 years that's how they always look\", instead of just saying no problem. Three minutes later 2 more slices were handed to us from the other gentleman that was working and looked just like I remembered not burnt. Which I know a pie was not make special for us in 3 minutes. Last thing to top the bad customer service experience there, when leaving wasn't aware of the clean up your plates policy and same rude worker in picture below yelled \"clean up you mess\" super loud and rude. We were shocked and my husband turned right around and grabbed our plates and drinks and threw them away! This was a horrible experience and probably will never return unless we are in area and she's HES not working! He might need a new job he enjoys and doesn't hate so much!",

Correction: this is our go-to pizza spot that we drunk walk to after stumbling out of NoDa 101 or JackBeagle's.   Its legit New York style thin, awesome flaky crusted pizza. The cheese is always good enough for me and one slice alone does the job to soak up all the alcohol. I mean, the slices are H U G E. Its worth the money.   The crowd is always eclectic and everyone is always happy. You'll see kids with their families, old folks, young folks, basically everyone enjoys this place. They also sell beer too! Pizza is cheap and tastes fantastic.   Definitely makes living in NoDa even better knowing that Benny's is the local go-to pizza joint!",

Benny's had a really neat vibe and you could tell they were used to pushing hundreds of people through every weekend. When I first heard $5 a slice I was asked my friend if it was worth it: then I received the slice on 2 plates!   This place is unique and I most enjoy experiencing the unique local spots. I had a meatball pizza that was on special and was more than enough food, plus a lot of local craft beer.   I definitely planning on coming back to Benny's when I work up my appetite again. Who know...perhaps I'll give their hour pizza challenge a try!",

Immediately, we were kindly greeted at the entrance and placed our order. There were so many places to sit: booths, high chairs, the bar, or a large picnic style table. We chose the latter and waited. The bathroom was astonishing, to say the least, but the food didn't take too long to arrive. The pizza is served on two plates, because each slice is huge! And delicious! Especially the crust, I loved the crust. I'd definitely come here again with a large appetite and craving for cheese.",

Benny Pannello's is a pretty cool joint, definitely a good stop during a bar crawl or just any day you are craving pizza (for me that's pretty much every 2 hrs).  Every time I come here I still have to laugh at the size of their pizzas... especially the boxes since they pretty much take up the entire width of a small sedan.  I may even have to put down the back seat in my Prius to get one of those babies home.  Pretty straightforward place.  Booths and tables, bar seating and the options for slices hanging behind the bar/register.  While you are waiting for your slice, you can watch the friendly and dedicated workers sling pizzas into the oven, slice them up, and serve them up on a double paper plate.  DOUBLE PAPER PLATE... that's how long the slices get.  I think they have 4 different slices (usually)... and of course you can order full pizzas of those choices.  They have specials per month.    Call ahead or order in.  You can bide your time with a wide beer selection or a Popsicle from King of Pops.  Parking is shared with neighbors Heist Brewing, usually not an issue to park here (which is a plus - especiallly in NoDa).",

It's pretty genius when you think about it.  Everyone getting kicked out of the bars at 2AM just floods into Benny's for a slice before heading home.  Late night herb enthusiasts can get their midnight munchie fix on too.  A better business model does not exist.  #nailedit  Don't expect a 5 star dining experience.

I have traveled hither and yon seeking out the perfect vehicle for cheese and mighty toppings. This place is definitely one I'll return to.   You don't get many choices in this place. I think they only had four or five options. But it's cheap. A slice is $4 or $5, depending on what you get. You might be thinking you need like three slices to be full. Not so, friend! I am a tank, and one slice was sufficient for me. One slice takes up two paper plates.   The pizza itself is thin and foldable. You don't get Chicago style here, which is good because I hate that kind anyway. They've also got some beers on tap, and a decent selection of soft drinks.   What knocks my rating down? The pizza was a tad greasy. I'm sure you could blot it off if you're so inclined. But I mostly disliked the atmosphere. I get that it's a no-frills place. I really do. But all of the tables were dirty with crumbs everywhere, and the booth seats were ripped to smithereens. It's kinda gross to sit down and just see inner booth contents protruding everywhere, along with someone else's Parmesan cheese remnants.   Still, solid food, and conveniently located next to Heist so you can get more beer when you're done. Or another snack. Not that I did that.",

After consuming a few beers in NoDa, I decided to try Benny's because it's relatively new to the hood. I ordered a slice of the mushroom and garlic pizza and the service was rather prompt. The sizes of the slices are quite massive, however the quality of the pizza was lacking. The mushrooms were luke-warm and tasted like they came straight from a can, I barely tasted ANY garlic, and couldn't eat it after a certain point because there was so much dough! Needless to say, if I'm looking for a place to get some post drinking food - I'll stick to Beagles or Fud. How this place received so many 5 star ratings on here boggles my mind!",

Arrived 5:35 and they had no record of my order. I was asked how I ordered it, if I had paid (which GH requires), and was asked to show my order from my phone. Almost as if the employee had never dealt with an online order. I'm currently sitting 15+ minutes later still waiting for my order. Save yourself the hassle and just walk-in. My husband ordered via phone a month or so ago and arrived and they'd given his pizza away to someone else. Clearly the staff can't handle phone or online orders. Disappointing because their pizza is good but I likely won't be returning when we are 0-2 for service.",

I'm guessing the five stars given to this place must have put on their own sauce like we did to make up for for the poor quality and poor taste.

    "text": "This is one of those reviews I kinda hate to write because I didn't actually get to try their pizza/food. Some friends and myself were enjoying a Saturday afternoon and I wanted to give Benny's a try since I've never had a monster sized pizza before and thought it would be nice to spring for one as a novelty treat for my friends. I called in to place our delivery order and come to find out Benny's does not take call in orders and you can only order through grubhub. OK. I'm a sport. Even though the person took the time to answer the phone and explain to me the ordering process that, in all, took up as much time as it would have to write down a order it's all good. So, moving along I fire up the grubhub app on my phone and begin searching their very limited selection. It seems as though if you want anything other than a pizza with anything except a small selection of toppings offered (pepperoni, cheese, mushrooms, sausage etc) you are out of luck here. Not wanting to give up I called back again to try and get some real time help with the pizza dilemma we were facing. I could tell the guy answering was, even though it was out of the norm for them, going to try and accommodate so he asked me what I was after. I told him green peppers and onions. He said \"we can't do that\" and that was the end of that conversation and my attempt to get a pizza from Benny's. The real kicker is that the special pizza that day was listed as \"vegetable\" lmao....It struck myself and my friends as funny that they couldn't pull together a phone order for a veggie pizza even though the special for that day was a vegetable pizza. What the hell is on their vegetable pizza then? Why is taking a phone order so complicated?.....I'd like to give this place another try sometime but it seems as though their business model isn't very flexible so I will know my next attempt will have to be on their terms and their terms only.",

    "text": "This is now my favorite pizza place in Charlotte.  I really hope they bring the spinach and artichoke pizza back, soon! Usually huge slices are limp and sometimes all of the toppings slide off when you pick it up.  Not the case here, the bottom is cooked perfectly and maintains a great crunchy texture.    I'm a ranch with pizza kind of girl and usually judge places based on their ranch.  Benny's may be bottled, which I am not a fan of, but the pizza is so good it completely makes up for it - I just know now not to bother with the ranch.    Really great selection of beer as well.  I usually tell the cashier what I like and have him pick one out, haven't been disappointed yet.",

    "text": "Forget New York style or Chicago. Debate's over really. I'd never heard of the Virginia Slice, but I'm a fan now! It's huge, but that isn't nearly the most appealing thing about it. The taste is amazing. The crust all the way through is delicious. The worst thing is when you open up a piping hot fresh pizza only to find with your first bite that the center is soggy right near the tip of the slice, like it just wasn't cooked long enough or at the right temperature. Not a concern here. It's thin and even and cooked all the way through. Benny's maintains a nice crust - not too crispy, not soggy at all. Then, right where the toppings meet the crust, there are pleasant melted cheese bubbles. Do you know what I'm talking about with the cheese bubbles? Those make me happy for some reason. So not only are the pizzas delicious, they're also fun and make me happy. Food should make you happy. Eat happy. Eat Benny's.",

    "text": "It's not the size that counts it's the... The size of the pizza and the late night hours has me thinking they are catering to a different demographic than the one I fit. I thought the pizza was ok.  Ordered 3 slices.   Mushroom - pretty sure they use canned 'shrooms, I'm not a fan of canned mushrooms.   Artichoke and spinach - good balance of toppings to pizza.   Cheese - they didn't skimp on the cheese but it also wasn't excessively cheesy.   The good - topping balance  The bad - the sauce, couldn't find much at all.  The ugly - the sauce doesn't taste good,  I felt it really detracts from the pizza. I had to ante up an additional fifty cents to get a comically small cup compared to the comically large pizza.",

We drove 40 minutes from Mt. Holly to get a slice and even called them before we left to ask if they were busy. They said they were not. Shortly after we left and even called them to pre-order our pizza. They told us they would not do a to go order, so we simply said okay and hung up. After arriving at 11:30 and standing in a line for over 20 minutes (after they said they weren't busy) and was then told they ran out of food as we finally reached the counter. We went home and ordered Papa Johns.",
