    "text": "Fantastic New York-style pizza but it doesn't end there.  This little neighborhood gem provides a casual and relaxed atmosphere and friendly service from the owners and staff.  We have been going there for years and certainly have our favorites including the fried calamari, penne all'arabbiatta, chicken scaloppine al vino bianco and tiramisu.  And the fresh baked bread served with dinner is wonderful.  Amalfi is also a great lunch spot but sadly, I don't work close enough to the University area to do that.  The pizza is top notch and this displaced New Yorker has been getting his pizza fix at Amafi for over 15 years now.  The stromboli and calzone are also good.  Don't overlook the homemade soups.  If Olympia ever teaches a class on making soup, I'm in.  Great, fun and authentic neighborhood Italian place that's great for the family.",

    "text": "I just had the WORST experience here at Amalfi's.  Our waitress was absolutely AWFUL - she acted like we were a burden and we were the ONLY people in the joint!  She was extremely curt, rude and majorly unhappy with her job and had no interest in being a decent waitress at all.  The owners really need to fire her.  It seemed to be family night - as in the family that ran the place was there - and they were only interested in watching the NASCAR race on tv.  We ordered salad and got a watery, disjointed handful of greens thrown on a plate.  I waited til my pizza came to tell the waitress about the awful salad, because I was afraid she would do something to my food.  I told her it was all watery (literally, there was water all in the plate) and instead of saying something like \"oh I'm so sorry\", she actually told me that yes, it was watery because it was \"fresh and from the garden.\"  Yes, that was what she said.  So my pizza was burnt on the bottom and had virtually no sauce - it was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had.  And this place was like a sitcom... other people came in that seemed to be friends with the staff and owners and they all had bizarre interactions with each other... the owners yelled at the waitress a lot, who kept going outside and sitting on the bench...  when our pizza was done, the cook put it on the counter and slammed his pizza cutter down and yelled at the owners to go get the waitress, who was outside again... the owners were yelling at the cook at some point later...  I was still eating my pizza - actually EATING the pizza - and the waitress came over and asked if I wanted a box for the three pieces that were left on the platter, and I said no, and then she asked me if I was done.  I stopped EATING to say NO, I'M STILL EATING.  Ugh, what a nightmare this place was.  Horrible.  Stay away.  You've been warned.",

So I not only gave her my order verbally but I pointed to it on the menu. We ordered a PLAIN cheese pizza for our small kids because you couldn't order by the slice at dinner. When the bill came she had charged me for a 3-cheese pizza which cost a lot more. I told the male owner I had ordered a PLAIN cheese pizza. He said, \"We don't even have a plain cheese pizza on the menu!!\" and proceeded to flamboyantly jerk up a menu to show me -- well, egg on HIS face because there it was on the menu!  When I explained to him that I had tried to make his server understand my order he said, \"DON'T POINT ON THE MENU!!\" He very begrudgingly gave me the pizza at the plain cheese price. I was totally polite to this RUDE you-know-what but I will never eat there again. I don't care if their food is good, they get a 0-star for rudeness.",

My girlfriend and I ate here for dinner and expected the food to be edible at the very least. This was not simply a matter of it being an \"off night\" - it was clear from the start that the quality of ingredients was well below what  one would expect from a low grade cafeteria. The \"house balsamic\" served over iceberg was watery and flavorless. The bread tasted like cardboard. Her Penne Arrabiata was coated in a less than generous portion of bland sauce and the pasta was overcooked. My eggplant parmesan sandwich (The Favorito) was not only foul tasting, but down right bizarre - like eating the fried skin of some weird alien, not even distantly reminiscent of what i know as eggplant, served on the same crappy bread. Somehow our waitress could not comprehend that we did not want boxes. We left with full plates, empty pockets and emptier stomaches.",

We wanted to see a menu, before deciding whether or not to eat in. A fellow Customer, sitting and eating his own lunch, had to direct us to where we could get a menu to look at. After deciding to give the place a chance and seating ourselves, our drink orders were taken. Their sweet tea definitely was NOT up to par with southern standards. Fast forward to us getting our food, i ordered their 2-slice Sicilian thick pizza lunch special. Definitely not impressed, as there was very little sauce shared on the pizza and there must not have been much variety in the cheeses as there was very little flavor. My friend ate the Mangia Mangia chicken Parm sandwhich. Never have i ever been to any food chain that provided only one type of one brand of chips as the only side item, i.e. UTZ Original chips, until I ate at this restaurant! Then, the waitress did not seem very interested in providing adequate customer service. It took a long while before our drinks were refilled, and she only checked on us once, toward the end of our meal. The only time she seemed polite was when giving us a check",

Got one with artichoke, and it was perfect.  Puffy, with just the perfect amount of ricotta, mozz and artichokes, with a side of marinara that, while not mindblowing, was very good.   GIrlfriend enjoyed the Fett Alfredo she got.  The price of hers was typical for this sort of place (overpriced in my mind, but still typical).  Mine was super cheap, especially for dinner.

Dunno how long these guys have been here but I felt immediately comfy - reminded me of my favorite pizzeria as a kid, except no Galaga.  Prices hovered around the super reasonable range on apps, a little high on pie and entrees. But yeah - great crust. Found myself eating it plain, with the pizza, dipping it in various things, sprinkling parm and hot pepper flakes on a plate and wiping, yeah, let's try it with some of that butter, etc. Bread was perfect, hot hot hot, thin crust and soft interior. Bruschetta simple but good. Salad dressing eh.  Margherita pie was really good - an interesting line between a street-style NY slice and something fancier. As in, all the crisp-but-chewiness, salt, and grease, but richer flavors.   Pasta dish was equally good - ziti and tomato, garlic, smoked mozz. Really hard to make myself take some home rather than scarf it all, right then. Only complaint - slivered garlic was pickled? Hmm.  If I lived anywhere near here, I'd eat here often enough to add some points to my cholesterol count, fo' sho'. As it is, we'll keep it for a special northside treat.",

    "text": "They don't deliver directly. They have you order through a delivery service. Then the service jaks up the price by 5 dollars.   Had the cream of asparagus soup and the linguini with clams. Portions were smaller than other restaurants. The soup was not creamy at all, it was thin. Tasted average. The linguini with clams was a little better than average in taste but there were no fresh clams as other restaurants serve it. Portion was a little smaller than others serve too.  When it was delivered to my hotel room there were no spoons for soup and no fork and knife for the linguini.  After factoring in the high price of the food (when you add the delivery charge) and no eating utensils and a snotty delivery person the entire experience gets a one to two stars from me.  Experience might have fared better if i actually went to the restaurant to eat instead of having it delivered to my hotel room.",

My wife and I had their veggie pizza, which is an unusual blend of great stuff. (No, I'm not going to tell you. You have to go try it!)  One of the twins had a meatball sub. He couldn't finish it, but he tried! The other one had a couple of slices of black olive and garlic pizza and wished he had ordered three slices. He was very happy.  If you want quaint surroundings and an atmosphere filled with aromas that will pique your appetite, try this laid-back gem of Italiana in Town Center, down the hill from UNCC on 49. It's as good as, or better, than ever.",

The waitress walks over and slaps menus down on the table and asks my friend what she wants to drink. My friend says water and before I can tell the waitress what I want, she's gone. I see her walking back with two waters (I wanted water anyway, but that's beside the point), but she stops close to the table and turns around to yell at one of her coworkers about utilities or bills or something that really should be discussed behind closed doors and not near your tables. She was very disgruntled and not kind at all. My friend and I order and she tells us we can't order off the dinner menu, only off the lunch, which is perfectly fine, but I was unaware of there being a separate menu until she pointed it out to us. She huffed and walked away and my friend and I decided to leave. We may get take out one night in the future, but will not be back to sit down. I know everyone has an off day but as someone who has waited tables for a while, I personally don't think there's an excuse for being rude or pushy.",

One view of the back of the menu reads like a grumpy diatribe of angry restaurant owners.   Splitting a plate will cost you, taking an order to go will cost you...basically anything that causes the slightest inconvenience for the restaurant will cost you.  You certainly shouldn't ask for soup instead of salad--that is met with a snarl and a grunt.  The chicken parm is dry and tastes like some dish you would get from one of those mammoth Chinese buffets.  We like to give smaller independent restaurants a chance, so we thought we would try it a second time.  However, after our last experience we will certainly never return.  It's no wonder the restaurant is always empty.  I'd rather deal with the mediocrity that is Olive Garden.",

Again, delicious.  And plenty of it!  It came with a small loaf of nice Italian bread and a salad.   Service was prompt and I was well cared for.

Pretty awful experience after driving five hours and being tired, starving, and wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel and relax.   Please fix your hours to spare the next person the struggle of finding a good local pizza at 11pm after driving to your closed location.",

The Italian dishes they offer are clearly made fresh and were served to our party fresh from the oven. I would give 5-stars but the wine list is quite short for an Italian restaurant with such an extensive list of entrees and I prefer to pair my Italian food with a glass of wine. Overall, I highly recommend dining here!",

We decided to sit outside, and that immediately caused a bit of an issue - the chairs are chained to the tables and it results in a somewhat awkward and uncomfortable seating position. Strange, and they never offered to unchain them for us.  Service was fast, polite and responsive. The menu seemed to be what one would expect from an Italian place. We started with the garlic knots - pizza dough with herbs and a marinara sauce. The knots themselves were tasty, but the marinara was a bit on the runny side. The bread that came with the meal was spectacular. We realize now that we should have ordered sandwiches. They're bound to be good on that bread.  We did not. We ordered chicken-stuffed shells and the fettuccine with ham, pancetta, mushrooms and peas. The shells came on a plate straight out of the pizza oven. My wife found the portion to be generous, but the dish was too salty. The fettuccine was perfectly al dente to me, but the sauce had broken, leaving oil/fat at the bottom of the bowl. Still tasty, but not ideal.  If we make it back, we'll be trying the sandwiches just to get more of that bread.",

She asked my friend if she wanted a to go box while we were still eating.

The first time we ever went, we ordered the Capellini Sorrento, spaghetti with tomato sauce with a side of meatballs and two custom slices of pizza all for $34! Their prices are reasonable for the large portions served.  Their garlic knots are super yummy; Their pizza is always very well done with fresh ingredients and a nice crust; Their meatballs had a nice flavor and weren't small and their spaghetti sauce has a nice flavor as well! The Capellini Sorrento (angel hair pasta with shrimp and scallops in a creamy pesto sauce) was a nice hefty helping of pasta with just the right balance of seafood mixed in and tasted good. We've tried a few other items off the menu, including their tortellinis and other various pasta dishes and thus far have zero complaints! Everything is cooked well, and tastes good!  I think my favorite thing about this restaurant is that they have a good sized children's menu with a variety of foods which is wonderful if you have a picky eater or one that enjoys trying new things or eating what the adults eat but in smaller portion form. The majority of their prices are reasonable for the larger portions you're served, so all I can say is dig in! We look forward to returning!",

Bored is only the start of it. They were not inviting to us walking in on a rainy Saturday evening with not a  patron in the place. I used to work for a family restaurant growing up that has been in business for 50 years so I know something about this.The daughter reluctantly waited on us as if she drew straws and was made to stand up. She picked her phone up each time she sat down after each visit to our table. The father walked by at one point and commented directly to me that one should never cut up your pasta, obviously , they had given me a large spoon to twirl my pasta and eat it the Italian way. When we had finished our meals and CLEANED our plates , the daughter picked up the plates and brought us our check. With that we wondered why she never asked , \"would you care for anything else?\" We asked for another glass of  Wine and a dessert. She said of course and re-calculated our check. Now, we are still the only couple in this restaurant after an hour, and not only that, we heard the son say in the kitchen has anyone called to see where this customer is and whether they're coming in to get their food tonight. The father called the number for the order of the two pizzas and the voicemail was not set up.  So basically they lost money on the sale and didn't want to ask us if we wanted anything else on our sale.  I would say after 25 years of business they have lost the interest in customers even with their typical service oriented culture in the restaurant service industry.",

    "text": "I came here for my weekly #foodieFridayfind. Which is my attempt to try restaurants that I haven't tried before. I remember coming to this place when I was a kid (because its been here forever) and I remember having the pizza but I have not been here since then.   I perused their menu on Yelp and noticed the well-priced lunch specials. Since I was in the mood for pasta, I decided to give their fettuccine alfredo a try.   I called in and placed my order with a pleasant gentleman on the phone. He told me my order would be ready at 2:05pm.  I found this very refreshing being that most places just say 10 or 15 minutes.   At 2:00 pm, I walked in and my order was already ready. The lady behind the counter had a personality so dry you could make sandpaper from it. When I walk in she said, \"Are you Britt?\" (Uh,,,what if I wasn't?!...But that's beside the point.) And began to ring me up without any further exchange.   After our awkward exchange, a kind older gentlemen came up and began chatting with me.  I looked in the bag and asked if there was salt and pepper and realized there were no utensils.  He handed me a wrapped set which had everything I needed inside.  I initially noticed him making his rounds to tables inside and outside, chatting up the clients. When we started talking, I realized he was the same gentleman that took my order so efficiently.  He has outstanding customer service and rapport building skills and was a breath of fresh air.      Beware the decor is definitely a bit dated but it is clean inside and out.    I had my typical open-air, picnic lunch (aka lunch in the car with the windows open).   First I went for the salad, it was disappointing at best: Red-tinted iceberg with a single tomato wedge.  The dressing was labeled as a balsamic vinaigrette on the menu but was really just oil and vinegar and no seasonings. I added some salt and pepper went for it. It was lackluster at best.    The bread was better.  It is definitely their pizza dough rolled in the form of a bread stick/mini loaf  It had that characteristic yeast-forward flavor of fresh pizza dough which may be off putting to some, but I thought it was pretty good.  It was certainly hot and fresh and had good texture, so all pluses there.    Admittedly at this point, I was skeptical about how the pasta was going to taste and I prepared for the worse. I was thinking that all my fellow Yelpers had led me into the lion's den ...But alas...  Yelp doesn't disappoint!  The pasta was absolutely amazing and quite possibly the most well-executed fettuccine alfredo I've ever had.  Perfectly smooth, quality ingredients, well-spiced.  The pasta was perfectly al dente with just the right amount of salt and pepper.  This whole meal (pasta, salad and bread) set me back less than $8. #win  I cannot wait to come back to have this dish again and try some of their other delectable delights.",

I ordered the chicken piccata, with a side of the spaghetti.  I am still smacking my lips from the taste of that tomato sauce on the spaghetti!   No other restaurant comes close!   I remembered from years ago that the family who runs this restaurant are very dominant in the dining area.  And they talk amongst themselves so that sometimes it is uncomfortable.  Today the daughter server told the owner father that she had to go and would not be able to take care of the table that got seated right before closing time. And then they were fussing about the register tape running out.  The mother owner came to our table to bring something.  Instead of thanking us for coming in and saying something kind to us, it appeared that she was annoyed by something.  She was wearing sunglasses that made her look like she was trying to be incognito.  Who knows, maybe she just came from the eye doctor. This stuff has been going on for years, yet their restaurant has survived.  It is because they have the best Italian food in Charlotte.  I love that it's not a chain restaurant, but just wish they could create a space that felt warmer and more welcoming. I have heard this from others for years.   But, did I say they have the best Italian food in Charlotte?  Go check them out.  It's worth the drive, regardless of where you live in the metro area.",

My boyfriend got the chicken piccata and he chose to have pasta (spaghetti and sauce) instead of a salad and it also came with bread. Everything was spot on. I had tea to drink, which for me was sweetened perfectly. Service was on point and attentive. We dined on Sunday and there were 2 tables filled with families and other patrons in booths as well. It made it feel very welcoming as if you went to a personal family dinner with the talk and laughter. Will definitely be back time and time again!",

I didn't eat the bread, but those I came with said the bread was very good and warm. The salad was ok. They use iceberg lettuce with carrots and tomatoes. The dressing (creamy Italian) is made from scratch and it was very delicious. The Shrimp Alfredo was good, but my plate could've used more sauce. I should've asked for additional sauce but didn't. The sauce was tasty, I just tasted the noodles more than anything. The owner is very interactive with guest, wanted to make sure things were ok.",

I would have liked better lettuce in the salads but all of our appetizers and entrees knocked it out the park and my teenagers were happy. The best part was the personal attention from the owners. This place is a must try! Delicious food, reasonable prices, excellent service!",

We started with the complimentary warm bread with savory garlic butter followed by bruschetta which was delicious    My entree was the veal scallopine with a side of pasta in traditional red sauce! I like my sauce with a hint of sweetness but it was still tasty    The veal was tender with just the right combo of white wine capers n lemon  only problem they were small portions for sure.    Hubby ordered pep n sausage hand tossed pizza and seemed pleased- the 16 inch is enough for two.   I ordered Tiramisu to go so I look forward to it being a sweet treat to a good meal.    From glancing around it looks like most of the entrees are generous portions so my veal dish must have been an exception.    This is our 2nd time here and we will definitely return.",

My husband ordered Veal Parmesan and it over cooked and lacked the pasta side. The blue cheese was clearly out of a bottle and didn't have any cheese chunks in to.  The Bruscetta was minimal- 4 small pieces of bread and tomatoes.  The worst part aside from the taste and utter disappointment was that it cost $50.00.",

Nice selection of local beers, wine and soft drinks. One of the owners came to out table after noticing my NY Yankees hat and we had a fun conversation.
