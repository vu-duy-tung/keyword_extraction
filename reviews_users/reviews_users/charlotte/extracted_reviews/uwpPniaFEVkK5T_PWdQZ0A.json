The food is great, the people are friendly and if you get there early enough on Sunday the lines aren't too long . . . yet. I always go for the french toast and bacon. It's fantastic. the skillets (The Lumberjack, The Wanderer, etc) are probably what they are known for but everything they make is delicious.  Also they have a program where you get one breakfast every time you get your card stamped 10 times.  Great place. But if you don't try it that's okay because the line will be just that much shorter when I want to go.",

The service every time I have been here is always fast and friendly and the prices are a little on the premium side but since the quality is so high you are getting what you pay for.   They are only open from 7-230pm every day so don't drag your feet getting here.   I can't really say enough good things about this place since the food is so awesome. The only thing I'd caution against is that if you are looking for a sunday breakfast/brunch get there early since it is usually packed out.",

We ordered biscuits to start and they had a \"reheated for a third time\" texture and taste.  They were already cut in half so they could reheat the inside. I ordered the bagel sandwich trying to keep it simple but after a long session of jaw aerobics trying to chew the rubber-like, over-fried egg I only ate half from exhaustion.  The \"Peasant Potatoes\" were cold and not fresh and trademarked? WHY? Service was ok but making a line to pay is for fast food restaurants and the always reliable Waffle House.",

We went for a Saturday brunch around 1pm before I headed to work and were seated right away by a nice lady hostess. After a bit of a wait, our overworked waitress got our orders, drinks and left us looking at the kinda cheesy, kinda Roman, kinda Garden Ridge, kinda homey feeling decor. I didn't mind it but this place it's la-te-da so FYI for all you la-te-da kind folks out there!  I dove right in to the crab cake benedicts and home fries for my meal and I was not disappointed! Huge cakes, great seasoning, and potato chunks that are funky and chunky in all the best ways, I was singing a song of MMMM and OMMMM on my side of the table all meal! Definitely would get again in a heart beat!  The date got pancakes but honestly forget which ones, but end of the story is that he said they were amazing too and we left with ZERO doggie bags in tow.  All in all, I am looking forward to going back again - we got out for under $30 for 2 people and that's a WIN!",

I did however have a couple drawbacks to mention unfortunately.    First was the time it took for visits to the table.  A little too much time in between visits created an issue where I literally had to go to the host station to request my check and pay for my bill.  The server was great mind you, but maybe overloaded.    Secondly, the salsa given was pretty hot, temperature wise.  I'm not a fan of hot salsa and I prefer it cold because the tomato dices don't disintegrate that way.    On the plus side, if the weather is nice it's a real treat to sit outside and soak up all that is suburbia.",

So first of all my service here was excellent probably it's biggest saving grace for me at this point and the ONLY reason for 3 stars. But now on to the food...  I ordered the cafe Vienna (all of their espresso drinks supposedly have two shots of expresso as is standard) but it tastes just like the International house Cafe Vienna mix you get at the grocery store blah!! No way there is espresso in that!  I asked my very attentive (sometimes overly so, but I was by myself) waitress what her suggestions were. She suggested the 18 wheeler which I had considered and then a bunch of super sweet things. So I went with the 18 wheeler which consists of 2 eggs, 2 sausage links or bacon, French toast, and their peasant potatoes.  Now my first red flag (after the coffee) was that I got my food less than 5 min after ordering??!  My eggs were scrambled like I asked but they were too wet for my taste, ( a lot of people like that so I didn't factor it into my rating). The sausage came highly recommended and it was my favorite part of the meal!! The French toast was okay, rather dry, but nothing special about it and the peasant potatoes while well seasoned were so dry not even ketchup could rescue them.   Now as I've sat here I've noticed people's food comes almost immediately after they order just like mine did... I hope theirs is hotter than mine was as everything on my plate was lukewarm and some of it very cold. I'd rather wait 20 min for food and get it hot than have cold food and no wait!!   I hear they have great sandwiches so I'll have to come back for lunch one day but as far as breakfast goes its a miss for me!",

I went in to get the takeout and they forgot an item,so, they had me pay and then wait for the missing item. It took them 20 minutes to cook the missing item,meanwhile,the rest of the food was getting cold. They gave me the missing item and I left. While walking to my car, the manager comes outside after me, yelling loudly at me in front of other Arboretum Shoppers\" You have to pay! You cannot steal food! You have to pay for all of that!\"  I was so humiliated! I explained what happened while showing my receipt and the manager said I had to return to the restaurant. I returned,found the employee who screwed up the order and had rung up my purchase. The employee apologized repeatedly and verified that I had paid and the manager,instead of apologizing,said\"well then,you can go.\" I said I was not leaving there without a full refund. I said I was returning their food,since they had humiliated me and did not apologize. The manager told me they did not allow food to be returned and I would not be refunded. I opened the containers of cold food and said I would contact the owner if I was not refunded for the entire bill,since they screwed up my order causing the food to go cold ,due to the lengthy wait,and then humiliated me for no reason.  They refused to refund me,so, I left the cold food there,telling them I would never eat there again and I would make sure all of my friends and neighbors knew how rudely they had treated me. The manager said it was a simple mistake and that screaming at me that I was a thief was not humiliating and they were happy I would not be back. So, if you are okay with the way they treated me,then,I guess,go ahead and eat there.However,even without their horrendous treatment,I would not return. The food is very bland. Try Another Broken Egg, Sky View Diner, Flying Biscuit,IHOP or even Cracker Barrel is not as bland!  They will all treat you with respect and serve you way better food!",

    "text": "Chocolate Chip Pancakes or the regular Pancakes with LOTS of Whipped Butter?  Both are really good and are making a BIG Breakfast!  Today it was Chocolate Chip Pancakes with just a little Whipped Butter because I have to lose weight and I have high Cholesterol (I counting this as a public proclamation that I'm going to do something about it, on Monday).  Three Links of \"Hawg-Wild\" Sausage, I was planning on eating two and taking one home and I did!  This is one of my favorite links of Sausage... It has a good flavor and i give it 4 yelp stars!  Hash Browns \"Cubed and Fried\" (on a hot griddle) is one of my favorite Potato preparations...  This was my only disappointment and not a big one. I have had these before, forgot that I did not care for them here and ordered them today.  Since \"Eddies Place\" is King of this \"hash brown\" style, Le Peep gets 3 stars for the potatoes.   The Service here is laid back, which I appreciate since I am almost never in a hurry.  I notice each time I have eaten here, none of the patrons seem to be in a hurry!!!  A leisurely Breakfast, with the one you LOVE or, or, or alone.  I'll probably have a date next time!  Patio and outdoor Dining!  This is a cool, cozy, partially private (in a nice way) spot!  Reminds me of the Charming Cafe (not the one in the Opening and Closing Scenes) in the movie \"Ronin\" though it looks nothing like the Cafe in the Movie, it is the Romantic idea for me!  No fan of most Chains, here is one of my FEW exceptions!  When I finally decided to move to Charlotte I was glad for Le Peep!  Las Colinas is where I first fell in Love with Le Peep... This was a weekend long Bachelor Party for Robbie the Love Knobby and when one of the guys (it was all guys) chose the Restaurant we thought he was kidding... \"We said what is it ?\"  He said \"French\", we said \"What\"???  \"Le Peep\" ...So we thought maybe we were going to the chain \"Popeye's\", cause it was a joke taking a bunch of men to a French Restaurant for Breakfast..  So we were saying \"Le Popeye\"... This guy was not kidding and that was my introduction to Le Peep!  I fell in Love!  The Love Affair continued in the next spot when I was considering moving the the Phoenix/Scottsdale Area... Another Le Peep!  This one may be gone now???",

    "text": "Let's just start off by saying that I will not return to this location.  This is a chain that has a surprisingly loyal following, but I will not be part of that multitude and here is why.  The interior has no sound abatement, so one cannot hear or understand the waitress.  This morning it was only a third full and I cannot possibly imagine what a roar it would be if it were full of patrons.  I ordered eggs over medium, sausage and potato, along with \"plain\" English muffin and juice.  My son ordered scrambled eggs, potato and corned beef hash.    Upon pretty fast service we were confronted with my fried eggs well-done hard, potato so dry that they sucked all the moisture from your mouth and were flavorless to boot.  Not a lick of salt, onion, oil, parsley or anything other than those miserable potato rectangles.    Sausages were good, flavorful and not greasy.  The \"plain\" English muffin came with the oil that they try to pretend is butter.  I handed the muffin to the waitress and reminded her that I wanted \"plain\".  She promptly informed me that they had two types of muffin, plain and whole wheat and I ordered plain.  This is when my son and I exchanged glances and knew, really knew that this was not our day to buy lottery tickets.  It is like ordering \"regular\" coffee in Mass and getting cream and sugar in it.  So be careful in your vocabulary or your expectations will be shattered.  Seek clarity from you waitress, if you can hear her and if she can her you.    My son's corned beef was straight out of the can, it just had been heated and broken apart from the can shape before serving.    We both left disappointed.  When the cashier asked \"how was everything\" she was simply going through the formula motions because she did not miss a beat in making change along with my silence.  It seemed that Le Peep is asleep both up front and in the kitchen.  I did look at the computerized bill and there was no descriptor for how eggs were to be cooked or for the muffin.  They must just trust the kitchen to cook it as they see best at any given time and if the waitress (yes, they were all females) is not on top of them the patron is at the mercy of the kitchen crew's judgement.  With so many restaurants and other forms of eating establishment in Charlotte don't waste your time at this particular Le Peep.  It appears that they are not worth a peep.",

My daughter loves the chocolate chip pancakes (duh).  Wife loves their Belgian waffles.  Staff members are friendly.  Wait staff hustles.  The arrival and check out processes are a little kooky (meaning there's not much space to wait when you first walk in, which happens to be the same place others are lining up to pay after their meal), but other than that, this place works for us.",

Most reviews were pretty alright and when we got there a lot of tables were empty since it was about 1pm. I like to sleep late, okay?  I ordered the eggs benedict \"Irish\", which is served with corned beef hash instead of ham. It was really weirdly crunchy, and I didn't finish it. My friend ordered a skillet (I am not exactly sure of which one) and their cheese was also crunchy. The cheese, it was crunchy. Why was the cheese crunchy? He also ordered a single biscuit with gravy and he got a single biscuit with some type of white gravy. The gravy had large sliced up pieces of sausage and he did not finish it.   I also ordered a coke, and it was really syrupy and tasted as if the ice had melted in it but they just put more coke in it to cover that. Soda is a hard thing to screw up on, but if you do that successfully then I worry about you.  The service was meh. Our server looked unhappy and distant, sort of like a girlfriend who is mad at her boyfriend but isn't going to tell him why and when he asks she says \"nothing\", which is a lie because everything is wrong.

I got the turtle mocha and Salmon & Avocado wrap with waffle fries. Lisa our server was very knowledgable and on top of things. My wrap was so delicious; the only thing being that the feta was so unevenly distributed, I only tasted it in one big clump in one of the wrap halves! Also, the mocha she brought out wasn't the one in the \"turtle mocha\" description; I didn't taste the caramel and it was missing the crumbled walnuts. Mom's dish was great...until she got to the eggs. They were so visibly NOT soft scrambled, I was kind of disappointed Lisa even brought them out. She offered to take them back, but mom's been watching those \"bad restaurant\" shows and she was hungry so they just stayed on the plate and, predictably, weren't eaten. It was mom's second time coming there, and the first time far out-shined this one, just on the basis of getting her eggs wrong this time.",

Le Peep also has some massive delicious pancakes, I'm partial to the Blueberry, but all of them are good.  Sundays are really busy, so be ready to wait a little, but if its a nice Carolina day, grab a seat outside and enjoy the fresh air with your orange juice and eggs.

Online there was a nice menu and what looked like an upscale restaurant.  I purchased a Groupon certificate so that we at there even though the floors were dirty, many table cloths were ripped, and it was cold. The first thing to arrive was my cappuccino.  I looked around for cinnamon, as there was none served with the drink or on the table, I had to walk up to the cashier to obtain some.  Eventually my husband's order arrived, minus the avocado that was a feature of the omelet.  Had he been notified upon ordering or shortly thereafter that there was NO avocado available, he would have ordered something different.  I also had a problem with my crepe.  The crepes were only room temperature as were the potatoes.  I did not send them back, because it had taken a long time to arrive at our table, and I wasn't going to have my husband wait for me to receive my order and sit there while I ate it with nothing in front of him.  The bacon was of poor quality.  Prior to leaving, my husband used the men's room and the stall closure was broken, hanging down, unusable.  That was something anyone who cares for the restroom would have seen.   It was all extremely disappointing, and I would never eat there again, and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone.   It was really bad.",

    "text": "Sunday breakfast is my favorite meal of the week, and a good yogurt & granola parfait with fruit is my favorite breakfast, so I was pretty excited to see that Le Peep had a Breakfast Banana Split on their menu, which on the website was listed as \"bananas, strawberries, yogurt and granola.\"  Yum. Perfect.    Upon arriving at Le Peep and taking a glance at the menu, I saw that it was listed as bananas, strawberry syrup, strawberry yogurt and granola.  Hmmmm, not as excited.  What came out was an old banana split in half in a bowl of store-bought strawberry yogurt with frozen blueberries and strawberries in their respective juices.  It was a lot of liquid all meshing together wrong and tasting pretty processed.  The coffee was pretty bad, and I'm no coffee snob.    The fella got corned beef hash with potatoes, eggs and an English muffin.  He said the English muffin and eggs were the best part... I couldn't even see any seasoning on the potatoes, and he said he couldn't taste any either.  The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired with Pepto-Bismol colored walls, wood paneling and stenciled stone murals.  The service was great, but the place just felt... sad.  Perhaps we should've caught on to the fact that the Manhattan Bagel place two shops down was more busy than the actual breakfast place.",

Pancakes are crazy huge and cake like, bacon crispy and decent peasant potatoes.   Great for a brunch spot under $15 Location is decent for walking after being so full!   Check it out!",

I ordered a broccoli and cheddar cheese omelette which came with potatoes and buttered toast.  The omelette was a little smaller than I'm used to and a little dry, but it was good.  The potatoes were mostly good but some were burnt.  The toast was buttered, which is important to me.  I appreciate when they do that work for you.  I ordered my son a single pancake... It was huge!  I ended up eating over 90% of it and can only describe it as a giant fluffy sugar cookie-- which is a good thing.  I'll definitely be returning.",

No doubt that the next time I'm in Charlotte, we'll be back.  But if you're lucky you might find one in your town as they are a chain restaurant.",

I have been there about 3 times now for breakfast, trying different things each time and it just keeps disappointing.  From the Biscuits and gravy to the Breakfast burrito (which says includes Chorizo, but that is some funky looking and tasting Chorizo) it is just an overall bland and half hearted attempt at breakfast.  Nothing taste fresh made.  It must all come from pre-packaged previously frozen boxes.    The ambiance is just a mediocre place to have breakfast/lunch.  Nothing on the inside has an aesthetic appeal to it.  They do have a little bit of outside seating, but even it is old run down patio furniture that is going to leave some sort of stain on your clothing.  The staff is just \"OK\"  they get the job done, but there isn't a rush to provide timely and quality service.   Again, this place is just not that good for the price.",

It's like they'd been baked, then fried.  Whatever it was, the texture was all wrong.  My egg dish was bland and a bit watery from the veggies in it.  It just created a kind of soup in the bottom of the dish, not very appealing.  My meal wasn't very hot, and even the toast seemed off, like the bread was already slightly stale.

They serve coffee on carafes and it's honestly never enough for the table..... there are times when you ask for a refill that it seems off-putting to the waitstaff. That said, the pancakes and food are always fresh and done right when we go and that's why we keep going back. They customize (eggs whites versus regular eggs, scrambled versus over-easy) and always get it right. That says something!! It's not the cheapest breakfast, but they're no different than the numerous other weekend breakfast joints around CLT. We are happy LePeep is here and will continue to be post-church regulars.",

The menu was a mix of every day favorites as well as some specialty items. The  choices were amazing and certainly tempting. Everyone in my party got something different. My own more traditional breakfast was okay but not any more than that. The temperature of my eggs and grits was tepid at best. I was also taken aback slightly at the price.

When she asked if I wanted a box because I didn't eat it I told her \"no, I didn't like it\". To which she just said okay and brought the check. She didn't offer anything to make up for it. The French fries were pretty good. But other than that, avoid it.",

I have tried several dishes from the past and the present. They closed the only one they had where I love now so I have to seek them out when travleing to Texas or North Carolina. The wait staff is always friendly. If you are a fan of orange juice order some because it is fresh squeezed and delicious. I love you Le Peep!",

The broccoli didn't taste fresh either.  I think this is a fine restaurant; I probably just ordered the wrong thing.  The service was okay.

    "text": "This bustling little European flavored restaurant is a local favorite. I love the festive bistro-like vibe and can understand its popularity yet personally have found the food and service to be just average over the years. In spite of that, I still seem to enjoy it a little more each time I go. Before today's breakfast  visit, it had been almost entire year since my last.  My wife and I ordered the Italian and Mediterranean crepes, which ran $8 each and included golden fried potato cubes as a side. The serving sizes were generous and the crepes were masterfully crafted - very thin with the perfect amount of golden browning - and beautifully plated.  The filling of the Italian was a bit dry; however, the Mediterranean filling consisting of diced chicken breast, spinach, onions tomatoes, feta cheese and black olives was quite good. In fact, I would order it again. We also enjoyed a couple of specialty lattes that were tasty, artistically created and very reasonably priced at around $3 each.  In the past, I have also tried the the 18 Wheeler, a simple breakfast combo comprised of Challa bread, two eggs over medium, two bacon slices and potatoes. At $9.25, it was a little pricey for breakfast, however, most everything was nicely prepared especially the skillet golden browned potatos. The Challa bread, which is just a fancy name for thick French toast, was just average at best however (as was the coffee.)  Service was very good and sanitation grade was an impressive 98 and is consistently in the high 90s. Of course the dining area was packed as usual. Again, although I don't love it, I do seem to like it a little more with each passing visit; that and readily available BOGO free coupons pretty much guarantee another meal there soon. With this review, I am also upgrading them from 3 stars to 4 for the first time; however in actuality, if Yelp allowed such precision, the new rating would be 3.75 up from 3.25.",

Our server was prompt and made sure our coffees stayed full. I had the harvest benedict which came with a side of potatoes. The benedict was delicious and the addition of sauteed mushrooms and spinach made it even better. The hollandaise sauce was fresh and flavorful. The potatoes were nice and crispy, a good compliment to the benedict. If looking for a breakfast in brunch place in Charlotte, I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Where to start? I usually frequent stacks or metro diner- but am always open to trying new places so decided to give Le Peep a try, BIG mistake. They nickel and dime their patrons in really grotesque ways. For example, I ordered my children adult sized drinks and when I requested a refill I was told they only give refills to adult drinks, exactly so where's my refill? The children drank the juice so the adult only rule applied there. WOW, but the fun doesn't stop there. When I ordered our pancakes- I asked if we could have one chocolate chip and one regular, was told by the waitress no problem there just will likely be a charge. When I got my bill they charged $2 for a few chocolate chips on ONE pancake. Are you actually kidding? Lastly, the eggs were runny and the French toast was undercooked but that is nothing in comparison to the poor service we received.",

    "text": "This has always been a favorite of ours for brunch. I had some friends that were from out of town that wanted to try this place out so we went. We didn't wait long for a table. Service was pretty slow. I got a sweet tea and there was absolutely no ice in it. It was warm. I had to ask for a cup of ice and that took forever to get. We finally ordered. Everyone got an assortment of items but most of us had bacon with our meals. We waited a while for our food but then the server came out and told us they were completely out of bacon. I do not see how that is possible. It's such a huge disappointment especially since the only option was to get sausage. They made our whole order and then told us about the bacon so we couldn't change our order. If I would of known they were out of bacon ahead of time, I wouldn't of gotten what I ordered. One person declined completely for a sausage substitute and the others just went ahead and got the sausage but most didn't eat it.   I just wish they should of known ahead of time they were out of bacon. An item like that should never be out of especially since there is a grocery store next door. It was also embarrassing taking my out of town friends here for such a disappointment. Our server was apologetic but it was obvious that there was nothing she could really do about it. Bad management.",

She then went on about how they offer discounts to ppl that offer her employees a discount. (didn't  ask for a discount) I told her I work for a franchise and that we also offer our guest tons of ways to save. She then thought it was necessary to tell me the franchise I work for (not own) is pretty big. (Awkward silence) On my way out she told me to have a good day, and I told her to have a better one. Very inappropriate and way too early for the nonsense....I guess Manhattan will get all of my money now.",

The restaurant itself is an odd-shaped, loud room with an atmosphere that's just...sad. Like a half-hearted attempt at creating something along the lines of the South of France. I'm normally not the person that really cares about this stuff, but it was hard not to notice.  I ordered the Spanish omelette. It came with potatoes and I subbed the english muffin for fruit. Honestly, everything tasted like it was frozen and heated in the microwave ( it also arrived really quickly...). It was drenched in salsa and sour cream, which should probably compliment the eggs not cover the bad taste.  The potatoes were soft and mushy and lacked taste. A little seasoning may have been in order??  Our waitress was distant and every other staff member seemed to look miserable too. We questioned the cleanliness of our silverware, also.   Maybe it was just an off day but it's hard to do breakfast food wrong. Le Peep managed it. I wouldn't recommend.",

There's plenty of it in every dish, and it's all made with fresh ingredients. Jay H. always gets the portobello panini, with its perfectly marinated 'shrooms. I've tried a few different breakfast items, and have always been happy. Highlights for me are the french toast and the Wanderer skillet, with fresh veggies and crisp potatoes. And they give you a whole pot of coffee, which means there's no waiting around for refills.

It comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, \"peasant\" potatoes and french toast. The meal was just bland, I've had a better breakfast at a T/A truck stop on Route 80. Eggs are eggs, link sausage was barely cooked, \"peasant\" potatoes were just that, poor! They lacked taste and texture. The french toast was two large pieces of bread, over dipped in a plain, tasteless batter. Using sliced sandwich bread for french toast was sub par for a restaurant with a name like Le Peep.   The service was fine, the waitress can't help the lack of ability in the kitchen. It has gotten dirtier from my last visit over 18 months ago. The carpet was dirty and the walls were banged up.   Le Plop needs a face lift. In agreeing with the other yelpers, the decor is lacking. There weren't many patrons dining during my visit and it was extremely loud.   Good Luck! It seems their weekend faithfuls keep them afloat! Does the South lack taste buds and palates?",

The server told me the corned beef hash came from a can which allowed me to make the informed choice not to get it.  Cons: - Their signature peasant potatoes could have used some seasoning. They tasted dry. Maybe I caught them on an off day but they have potential. In fact, most of the food could stand some seasoning.  Verdict: I would go here again. The pancakes looked really good. It's about the same price as Cracker Barrel with larger servings and less flavor. Better seasoning would have garnered a 4-star rating from me.",

    "text": "The name LePeep reminds people of Eggs Benedict.  That is a double-edged sword.  My bene was the \"Crab cake\" one.  I would have like REAL crab in there though.  Imitation crab meat is nothing more than fish, chopped, formed into strings and dyed on the edges.  It resembles vinyl.  Tasted like it too.  Especially since one side was burned black as pavement, while the other side never touched the grill.  Add the uncooked English muffin, overcooked poached egg, and you really don't have a winner.  But hey- they did cover it in hollandaise sauce, so I couldn't see it.  it's all good now right?",

Yea, this place isn't anything special on the fancy side or foodie side nor is it a hole in the wall. Just your average brunch/lunch place in atmosphere and surroundings. Locally franchised. HOWEVER, having tried EVERY, and I swear, EVERY brunch spot in South Charlotte, from the Terrace Cafe's of the world, to Skillet's (now Broken Egg), to New South (next door to Le Peep), to Vine American Kitchen, 131 Main, Flying Biscuit, Big View (YUCK!) etc. etc. etc. this one actually has the highest rating for us next to Terrace Cafe. The skillets are yummo, our eggs are always perfectly cooked as ordered, the kids menu sufficient and pleasing with coloring and games to boot, and the service is ALWAYS good. They are consistent, have a very large and diverse menu, something for everyone. The crab cake benedict is a tad heavy on the breadcrumbs and less on the crab side but hey, this isn't your froo froo brunch spot, so have realistic expectations when you go and order accordingly. My other half got the corned beef hash skillet on his first visit here with us and blurted out \"FINALLY\"! He had finally found a spot in South Charlotte with the salty NJ diner type hash he had been seeking, not fried potatoes some places actually call \"hash\". This is a favorite spot of ours, make it one of yours too!",

    "text": "I went to the Le Peep in Orlando once for brunch in the early 2000s.  I was amazed by the 80s country decor with hunter green tones.  (Note: sarcasm.)  After moving to Charlotte and not aware yet of any brunch places, we decided to give the Le Peep here a try.  Wow--same thing.  It's like every Le Peep was built in the 80s and hasn't changed a thing since.  Their menu items for brunch are pretty good, but the atmosphere kills it for me.  You'd do better going to Good Ol' Days just on the other side of the Arboretum shopping plaza.  1950s decor = cool.  1980s decor = uncool.  But maybe if they wait around a couple more decades they'll be considered \"retro.\"  Who knows?  For me, now that I've discovered them, there are much better brunch options in Charlotte.",

Our first visit there (and last) I'm trying to figure out the menu. I ask the waitress \"it says here all scrambled eggs\" can I have sunny side up instead?\". She says \"Of course, anyway you want them other than hardboiled!\"  Five minutes later I decide to order the \"dawn breaker\" special with fried eggs, the waitress says\"no that one is only available with scrambled eggs and you HAVE TO hurry up because the kitchen closes at 2:30\"  \"someone could have let us know before they sat us down, outside it says ALL day\"  she answers \"but it doesn't say dinner!\"  Good move dummy trying to win an argument with the client. I tell her ok but I want the eggs lightly scrambled not well done.  And of course I got scrambled eggs so overcooked they were hard enough to be hard boiled, and the bacon was MIA from the plate and the country potatoes were frozen. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because when I told the waitress that no, the food was not good she got the manager who came over, inquired and adjusted the bill. It still came to $11 for a salad and two coffees but I was not in the mood to go over the bill.  When I stepped outside there were several dark grey streaks of grease from the seat on the back of my left calf, luckily I was wearing shorts. WTH that really takes the cherry.",

    "text": "Brought my youngest to breakfast here.  We were seated right away, and ordered within about 10 minutes.  Our food was out in a reasonable amount of time.  My Spinnaker (egg white omelet with mushrooms, bacon, and spinach) was pretty good, although I ended up eating around a lot of the bacon.  It wasn't crispy, and seemed kind of flabby.  Ew.  Overall though, it was pretty decent for egg whites.  The potatoes were pretty good.  Seasoned well, and not as greasy as in many places.  My meal also came with an English muffin, either white or honey wheat.  My son ordered a funny face pancake.  Now, I know that this is going to sound picky, but the pancake started with the standard round pancake, with a face made with whipped cream and a couple of pieces of fruit.  It got a little weird when they added 2 ears, sort of like Mickey Mouse.  If Mickey had gotten caught in some kind of farm machinery.  One ear was maybe 2 inches around.  The other was huge, and more like a giant tumor off of the head part.  Seems like if you are going to bother trying to make it fun for kids, just do it right.  If you are pouring a pancake and see that you have totally jacked it up, stop cooking that one and pour another one.  It's maybe a few cents worth of wasted batter, right?  The pancake tasted fine, but the syrup container they brought was SO hot that we couldn't touch it.  The waitress even warned us about it.  I tried to let it cool for a minute, but then our food was getting cold.  I ended up grabbing it with a napkin like a pot holder, but it was really a mess.  After eating, we waited.  And waited.  I tried to make eye contact with our waitress, but she walked over to a table and sat down, talking to a customer.  Seemed like she was also taking his order, but also just chatting.  I dunno... I wouldn't rule out returning, but I'm not going to go out of my way to do so.",

Plenty of choices from lighter fare to traditional American breakfast to full on steak and eggs, large omelets, etc.  Nice atmosphere.  Convenient and fast.  Update based on more recent visits:  Breakfasts are not as good as in years past.  They used to serve the plates overflowing with food.  You paid $6 for a basic American breakfast but you got sausage or bacon, eggs, grits or potatoes and toast or an english muffin.  What was once a LOT of food is now just sort of enough.  And the cost is almost double.  Add coffee, tax and tip and you should be getting a premium breakfast.  This is more what you'd expect at a Denny's.  The staff is nice but won't really go out of their way for you.  It's an OK place but there are a lot of alternatives.",

Other than that, every thing seems to be cooked right.  We think when it's busy (Sunday am) they turn up the heat to speed things up, but they don't want to overcook, so the middle doesn't cook enough...just a theory.  Nothing worse than raw eggs on your french toast though.  The menu needs to be updated.  Too many bland dishes.  It's good food overall though, but nothing really sticks out.   For example, I had the Desperado which is probably one of their most flavorful dishes.  It's a skillet with potatoes, peppers, onions, cheese, this mexican type sausage (can tasted cilantro in it i believe,) salsa and two eggs on top.  The sausage is unique, but just decent, not great.  Good overall, but I was not blown away.  The salsa tastes like newsman's own, which is great for dipping chips; but probably should be substituted with something else.  Lots of hearty meals on the menu and they do those very well.  They do bacon, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and country potatoes very well.   So if you're in the mood for that type of breakfast I recommend it.",

I had the California Turkey panini without the turkey and bacon, and the waiter didn't even give me any attitude about changing the menu options. There's also lots of breakfasty-stuff, so it's one of those wonderful places where it's kind of safe to bring anyone...no matter if the group wants lunch or breakfast or meat or vegetarian or sweets or whatever...Le Peep can accomodate.",

The hubbys pick - banana and strawberry crepes. The best part - you'll find neither item on the menu. They totally let us customize and create our own (good thing since I'm a veg-head). The waitress didn't even blink when hubby made his strange (yet super yummy) pick. Just smiled and said \"sounds good\"! Breakfast isn't breakfast with out a good cup o' Joe. Le Peep delivered yet again. My own carafe of coffee on the table. And good coffee at that!  Waitstaff was good - we weren't bothered by them much, yet we weren't ignored either. Service was fast and correct.  Just a few things to point out : I saw no flies like a previous reviewer said. Zip. Zero. None. There wasn't a wait when we went, despite the fact that it was 10:30 on a Saturday.  We caught a glimpse of the pancakes - HUGE! They over took the plate.  Last word: I'd go again.
