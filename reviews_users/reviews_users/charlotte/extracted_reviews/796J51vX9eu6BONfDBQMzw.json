The only reason someone even came over is because we had to flag someone down. Not one server even looked at us or asked if we had been taken care of. So after 730, we ordered finally around 8. Waited another half hour for food. Seriously they weren't even busy. Then when we got our bill, the amount for a drink we had ordered was 6.00 higher on bill than what the menu said. Had to call manager over to correct. Seriously worst service and so slow! And expensive for food quality! Went one time 3 years ago , tried again tonight and never going back!!:(",

    "text": "What can I say about my recent experience with Vine....my parents and i went here Friday night for dinner and we have NEVER had a bad experience before but oh boy...Friday was an experience. The waiter was very off his game...i don't even know if he knew his own name or what day of the week it was. Took him forever to bring my wine, i arrived about 10 minutes before my parents and he didn't bring it until after they arrived and ordered their drinks. We were delivered the wrong order which was a different tables. They have a $1 bread service which is free refills...since when do nice restaurants ask you to pay for bread?! Bizarre. Our waiter forgot to put in our jumbo wing order, so when they came out they were right before our food and they were not jumbo. Hooters gives you bigger wings than this place. They did have a good smoky flavor to them though, i think this was the best part of our me. I ordered a cup of the tomato bisque as a stater and what i thought was a piece of plastic was in my soup so I could not finish it. The manager came over and informed me that it was not plastic, it was the outer skin of an onion. I informed her regardless of what it is it's inedible and not suppose t one in there.  Our food finally came out and it was terrible. My dad's prime rib sandwich was tiny, i think a Chick-fil-A sandwich is bigger. His fries were cold and greasy. I ordered the pear roasted salad with salmon. The salmon was cold and the pears were straight out of the can. They were gummy and chewy. There was nothing fresh or roasted about them. My mom's flatbread was burnt on the bottom and you could tell it had been sitting because the cheese was hard. The manager came back to check on us and we informed her this was the worst experience we have ever had probably at any restaurant and everyone needs to get it together. She covered our tab and also gave us a $50 gift card. Which was extremely nice of her. She is the reason why i am giving this post 2 stars when really i probably wouldn't have even rated it...we did love this place. We even had my moms 60th birthday party in the private room. We probably won't be back for a while until they can take the time to work on things. Definitely prefer 131 main over Vine.",

Had the entire space around the fireplace to ourselves.  Our cute waitress was always on the watch for empty glasses but never hovering - hate hovering - also tried some apps - potato chips but without the described blue cheese sauce - very good and guacamole - usually do not order this unless I am in a Mexican establishment but remember, it was raining - so threw caution to the wind and was not disappointed.  Definitely want to go back to try a full meal.  Again, service was fantastic and the soft furniture in front of the cozy fireplace was the place to be on Saturday.",

    "text": "I visited for the first time during Restaurant Week. Their  RW menu was one of the weaker ones that I have seem BUT they did include a glass of wine, holler! The overall  regular menu was typical, steaks, burgers, chicken, fish, salads and sweets. There really wasn't anything specifically that knocked my socks off on the RW menu. I had the salmon (which I hardly ever order because it seems there is  a phobia here in Charlotte to prepare Salmon medium rare). It was very good, cooked to perfection and laying on a bed overly buttered mashed potatoes. I personally am not complaining, I'm just warning you. I think it also came with a few spears of asparagus but I can't remember. Clearly they were not that impressionable or I would have remembered. The dessert was a cheesecake with cranberry sauce drizzle. I question whether it was made in house and the portion size was disappointing. A  graham cracker square sized slice does nothing for this girl.   The atmosphere was cozy ( a little loud because of the live music in the bar) and the server needed to find another profession. It was very apparent that she did not want to be there. Came over one time after our dinner arrived and then gave us the check.  I would go back. It's a good general type place with something for everyone.",

    "text": "I think it is necessary to give a little back story before getting into my review... I called earlier in the week to ask about their reservation policy because we had a party of 8.  When I spoke to the hostess she indicated I had to speak with their event planner for a party of \"our size\" because they can't really accomodate that many and they don't take reservations.  No call back so I called again 2 days later and left another message.  The event coordinator called me back eventually leaving me a pretty rude voicemail reiterating that they only have one area by the bar that can seat 8 people and their banquet room was booked already.  She proceeded to say that they anticipate about an hour long wait for a party our size.  From the very beginning I felt like having a party of 8 was the biggest hassle!  I called back and asked to talk to a manager since this was a bday and we wanted to at least have some type of communication that this oversized party was coming in.  The female manager was not very helpful and just simply said they aren't really set up for larger parties so I can try to call ahead and they will just do what they can.  She just acted rather snotty and once again as if this was majorly inconvenient.  Not impressed at all!  Quick wrap up...we were sat right away.  The waitress was pretty nice.  The place is big...nicely decorated..not intimate...looked like a chain restaurant from the inside.  We ordered the guacamole and fried green tomato apps and they were both pretty bland and small portions.  Some tried the ribs, the flatbreads, salads, burgers, etc.  Everything was just ok.  One member of our party didn't get his food until we were all done due to the waitress's mistake.  It happens, but no manager apology, and really it was barely mentioned by the waitress.  She did offer a free dessert at the end so that was nice.  The banana cream pie wasn't good, the key lime pie was super tart and the apple crisp was the table's favorite.  Overall, the food was average at best. The service was average  For the price point, you can do better.  I wouldn't return.",

    "text": "This was my first trip to Vine and the wife and I had a great meal.  We ate about 8pm on a Friday and were seated promptly in the terrace room.  The restaurant was not very crowded overall as we noticed available tables in different areas of the restaurant.  The terrace room where we were seated is off the bar and has a big fireplace, which would be a great place to enjoy a drink and some appetizers.  We were greeted by our server Leanne within a couple minutes for drink orders.  I was in the mood for a beer and the server mentioned that they had just tapped a new OMB summer IPA and she offered to bring me a sample to try before deciding.  I thought this was a nice touch without having to ask.  My wife ordered wine and I decided to get the IPA that I sampled.  They have a good wine selection with many wines available by the glass.  I thought the appetizer, salad and entree selections had good variety and offered some differences from other similar type restaurants in S. Charlotte.  I ended up choosing the New Orleans gumbo and the ultimate grilled cheese with slaw.  The gumbo was decent and the grilled cheese was great.  It was thick sliced toast with 3 or 4 different cheeses and tomatoes.  My wife had a corvina fish special with potatoes and asparagus which was very nice.     We finished the meal with an espresso for me and coffee for the wife.  Espresso tends to be hit or miss at these types of restaurants, but I found the espresso at Vine to be a good finish to the meal.  I felt the overall service was very good, attentive but not overbearing and well paced.  Based on some of the past reviews, they seem to be paying attention and working to correct any issues.    Vine will definitely get mixed into our S. Charlotte restaurant rotation!",

Our waitress, Holly, was very nice. We both ordered the filet mignon entree. Mine was unevenly cooked. I requested medium but it was a mixed of medium and well done. I didn't send it back because it was seasoned really well and it wasn't that big of a deal to me. Just a warning for those that are particular about that sort of thing. The sides were Rosemary garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus were huge and seasoned well. The Rosemary overpowered the potatoes so I didn't enjoy them as much. The dessert was a chocolate brownie with ice cream drizzled in raspberry sauce. The sauce was bad. The dessert would've been stellar with a different flavor which I found out later they also offer chocolate so be sure to ask! Overall a descent dining experience. I wasn't overwhelmed or underwhelmed. It's not high on my list to try again but if given the choice I wouldn't turn it down either.",

    "text": "Went to Vine American Kitchen for Christmas Eve dinner this year because hey, who wants to cook before the big day?  Sweetie heard they were going to do a lobster thing, and we like lobster so we made reservations for 6 people.  Got there at 5:30 and was seated immediately.  The server greeted us immediately and seemed pleasant enough and we always appreciate them working the night before a holiday.  The menu is great here, they have a little something for everyone.  I decided to go with the Surf and Turf.  I also ordered a side salad....2 issues are that they have a strange offering of dressings.  I can appreciate variety and \"different / floofy\" dressings but I was told they don't have Honey Mustard and Ranch.  Strange right?  Anyway, I went with the Garlic Parm dressing.  There was a tremendous amount of time lapsing between ordering my salad and when I asked the server he said the \"kitchen was backed up\".  Young Man, I've learned a few things in my years....probably the biggest lesson is not to lie to people.  The restaurant wasn't crowded and it's just a salad.  Of course the salad comes out exactly one minute before our meals which is one of my biggest pet peeves when eating out.  They saw my displeasure and I told them to take the salad away and makes sure not to charge me for it.  The Manager and like 3 other people came by to apologize which was also annoying but we must move on.  The entree was OK.  The lobster was good, well cooked and tasty.  The \"turf\" left a lot to be desired.  CAB \"Heart of Ribeye\" may sound fancy on a menu, but the end result was a thin, poorly cooked cheap piece of meat.  Because it's so thin, almost sirloin like it was just filler and not at all tasty.  Everyone else was OK with the meal...nothing earth shattering good or bad.  I will say the server this evening wasn't on his game.  My drink went dry 3 or 4 times and I had to flag someone down for refills.    Not the best meal, and a reminder why I don't come here often.",

The cornbread was way over baked, dark brown in color, and actually burned on the bottom. Apparently, whoever packed this crap for me saw the same thing I did.  Sooooo instead of re-making it, the folks over at Vine took their grubby fingernails and picked off some of the burned portion from the bottom. See the pic.  This is how it looked when I opened the box (less a portion I had already cut off and tasted noticing the nasty burned taste.). I called the mgmt and after telling Jordan about this he \"offers\" to remake it and for me to drive back to them and get one they hadn't burned. He actually said that \"was the best (he) could do.\" I'm not a fan.",

All the wait staff from the hostess, bartender to the server theu were all great they were courteous and not afraid to talk. The food was excellent it was done very professionally and tasted awesome.

The hostess sat us and told us the name of our waiter. The waiter was very nice and professional. The wives enjoyed the wine. Both were pleased. The food was sensational! I had Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. The cakes were so meaty but very moist and tender. The wife had the Cajun Filet Mignon. This too was very delicious. The filet was cooked to a perfectly medium rare temperature. The potatoes and the creamy sauce on top complimented each other very well. We felt relaxed enough to linger awhile and talk over wine and dessert after our meals. The only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars is due to the fact that the lighting was very dark for my ambiance flavor. I like a nicely dim lit restaurant. But the lighting was so dim on Saturday I was confused as to whether it was bedtime or dinner time! But all in all, a great experience. Can't wait to get back there.",

First of all-Do not go in here with a high expectation because it is in the Ballantyne area or because the outside looks nice.To begin with- we walked in and the hostesses were extremely rude and unwelcoming. They seemed snobby like they didn't want to be bothered. Not the best representation to have at the front of your establishment. As I watched, I noticed their level of customer service fluctuated depending on who they were servicing as well. When we went to be seated the waitress took us and asked \"is this seat okay?\" And when we replied that we'd actually prefer sitting more towards the interior (instead of in the back corner by the kitchen) she left us and went back to the hostess area like she had a problem. Why ask us our thoughts if you really don't care where we'd like to seat or if it would be such a problem? Then when we went to the hostess area to ask who we should be following for our table now- the hostess with blond hair say \"excuse me?!\" With a bothered attitude. I feel really  sorry for the manager who has to deal with this mess and hope he can clean house and make this restaurant what it should be. If you decide to go here- just don't have high expectations so you won't be disappointed by poor customer service.",

My wife had a shrimp salad.  Looked a little boring to me, but she seemed to like it.  We had a Vermont crumb bread pudding thing for dessert, with vanilla ice cream.  The ice cream was too cold, not very creamy, but the dessert was pretty tasty after we let it melt a bit.  Wine list:  good selection but not a True wine lovers list.

The positives: Service is USUALLY pretty good. Brunch was an exception, my bloody mary had been prepared by the bar, but it sat, at least 10 minutes judging from the watery mess from melted ice when it finally arrived at the table WITH our food, not prior. And it was tiny, served in a small bar glass. Dinner I rate a 3, it is pretty pricey for what you get, but the wine selection is good and there is a diverse menu. Brunch gets a 1. The food was overcooked, I will say they made an egg right after it was served and brought me another, but the portions were very small for the price and overall, not good. Their average for us gets a 2. It is never overly busy so if we go to Vine ever again, it will likely just be to have a cocktail in a nice environment",

    "text": "I rarely give a 5 star rating to a restaurant but I couldn't find anything wrong with this place.  We arrived on a Friday evening and was promptly seated.  The place was about 75% full.  The staff was incredible from the hostess to our waiter, Marshall.  I was there with 3 friends and we were really looking for a good meal, good wine and a place to catch up with each other.  Within a minute or two our waiter arrived and asked it we would like to place our drink order.  We were still looking over the wine list and he then said he would get our water.  One thing that impressed me was he asked if everyone wanted lemons in their water.  I hate lemon in my water and have never been asked this.  One bonus point for Marshall.  When he returned he asked if we had any questions and we asked him several questions on the wine, all of which he answered, you could tell he knew the wines quite well.  When the wine came he asked if we would like to test it before he poured all of us a glass, another bonus point.  At this point I am wondering why this place gets such bad reviews but then again we hadn't had anything to eat.  We asked for some time to chat and he was very accommodating.  I despise going in a restaurant for dinner and being rushed.  He checked back with us a couple times and again we asked a few questions about the nightly special and he gave us his opinion on some of the entrees.  I had the pork which was amazing along with the house salad, the white balsamic vinaigrette was wonderful.  One of the ladies had the special which was a swordfish and scallops combo with house made pita.  She said it was also amazing.  The two other ladies had the salmon and they also said the food was great.  Marshall checked in with us a couple times to see if we needed more wine and to make sure everything was ok.  Before preparing the bill he asked us if we would like him to split the bill instead of just handing us one bill.  All in all it was a great meal, great service, great wine.  I will definitely be back.  BTW I am a restaurant owner and I look for flaws, I couldn't find one.  This will definitely be a place I come back to.",

There is a beautiful fireplace with comfortable sofas to sit on while waiting for your table.  For a large restaurant I appreciated the lack of background noise.  I have a little trouble hearing conversation with a loud \"din\" in the background.  As for ambiance, A++.  The hostesses were very friendly;  I was shocked to read some of the other critiques which labeled them rude.  This was certainly not the case with us.   Our food was excellent.  I had the fillet which was tender and moist and cooked just as ordered.  My wife had the crab cakes which she said were the best she'd ever eaten and on par with the quality of our favorite restaurant in Atlanta, The Atlanta Fish Market.  My daughter had the \"chef's special\" which she said was very good.  I ordered the gumbo which I enjoyed:  It was the perfect temperature and portion and very tasty.  My daughter got the soup of the day, butternut squash, which she let me taste.  Delicious.  We skipped dessert because we were sated and didn't have room.  Over all it was a great dining experience.  Our server, the owners, managers and chefs certainly deserve kudos for their efforts.  My wife and I dine out frequently and I can see that this will be one of our favorites and we will dine there every time we're in Charlotte visiting our daughter.  Too bad there's not a Vine American Kitchen in Atlanta.",

    "text": "Chose to go here for an extended family birthday dinner. We arrived on a sleepy Sunday evening with virtually no customers there - easy to get a table!  Service was very good overall - we had multiple server coverage and she was great adjusting to the dietary and child food restrictions.  They have a great happy hour food special so we started with wings and calamari - both good, wings had solid heat. For our entrees we had a variety of salads, the prime rib special, the roast chicken, BBQ pizza and the tomato bisque. Of those the bisque and roast chicken were standouts, well seasoned, bursting with flavor and the chicken had great sides (sweet potato, Brussel sprouts). Unfortunately the prime rib was average - fatty and dry.  Overall Vine is a reliable choice in Ballantyne and a good alternative to places like 131 Main.",

I've added the Jalapeno cornbread and sweet potato bread pudding to my list and the fish sandwich they offered one afternoon I stopped in and sat at the bar (it was a special and not on the menu). The Pros: Location, vibe, several food items, the bar scene, the patio The Cons: The inconsistency of great service, this includes hostesses as well as wait staff going from AMAZing one visit to Uninterested the next visit.  I would recommend this place to others merely because it's good and in a good location and they may be lucky and get one of the AMAzing staff as their server.",

When my wife walked in her friend said had stood there the whole time and no one spoke to her. There were as many as four girls at and around the hostess station at one time while she waited for my wife. Not a single one of them acknowledged her, greeted her, smiled at her, asked her how many in her party, are you waiting for another person...they just stood there and talked with each other. Evidently the last thing on any of their minds was the guest standing in front of them.  It amazes me the lack of interest your employees had for this customer who would have helped pay her salary. Needless to say they left and then went to Stone Mountain Grill and had an enjoyable meal where they were greeted and treated with respect by everyone there.",

There was also a nice group room with a fireplace that was being used by a family that night. It was surprisingly empty at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. The hostess was extremely rude and short. Our waitress didn't even introduce herself and almost ran away before I had a chance to ask her a question about the menu. It unfortunately got worse from there. We never received refills on our tea and waters. Our salads didn't have dressing tossed in. My date order an entree sized salad and asked for tosses in dressing and instead received a tablespoon of dressing on the side for an entree sized salad. It took 10 minutes to try to flag someone time and then another 10 minutes to get another side of dressing.   Service here was really lacking. I want to give this place another try because the food was actually pretty good. I would try sitting at the bar next time.",

As is often the case, they were more interested in the banter between them or at least distracted by it than getting us seated. This, of course, says nothing about the food, but it does say something about managing staff at the first critical moment of truth. It all adds up. Better places get this right, of course.  The service was very good but the food was average. We both ordered the roast chicken with mashed potatoes and haricot green beans. The chicken was delivered like warm so we sent it back. The replacements were noticeably better but still not really hot. The mashed were fine. But the beans were a little too al dente to our taste and the sauce was muddy, the flavors indistinct. That was our main complaint with the whole dish; there was something  of a poultry seasoning-type flavor on all of it making it all kind of taste the same. This struck us as an overreach on the part of the chef trying to be too creative. Simple and clean far better and preferred. They comp'd the key lime pie which was very good, but sadly too little too late. We won't be coming back. 131 Main is far better.",

The prices were a little high, however if it was truly farm to table food we were willing to pay for the better quality food.  However, that was not what we got.  We ordered a couple of different things to share between the two of us, that way we could taste a couple of different things.  We got Steak Lettuce Wraps, a Margherita flatbread, and Ultimate Grilled Cheese (I love adult grilled cheese sandwiches). The lettuce wraps were ok, nothing special about them, and the same with the flatbread.  However the Grilled cheese was the worst grilled cheese I have eaten at a restaurant.  They made the sandwich out of Texas Toast that you get from the grocery store, which is some of the worse bread you could use for a sandwich.    Nothing blew my mind about this restaurant and I don't believe that it's farm to table food, it would have been much better.  My fiance and I prefer my cooking (which is farm to table cooking) over this place any day.  We will not be returning to this place again.",

The main meals we got were steak and eggs with grits and crab cake Benedict with potatos. We were wonderfully surprised . The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and the grits were cooked perfectly. The crab cake was a real crab cake with no fillers. No fishy taste. Which is rare in charlotte. The hollandaise was prob my favorite part, just like my mothers, homemade and delicious. They poached the eggs perfectly with no break. The potatos were perfect too. Super happy, will return again for the sunday brunch.",

We probably will not visit again because we can get great food elsewhere for a better value",

    "text": "Went to Vine \"specifically\" based on strong Yelp reviews about \"crab cakes\".  Ordered three appetizers (including crab cakes) and shared two salads in order to get a good sample of Vine's offerings.  Salads were very good.  Crab cakes were \"mushy\", resembling animal droppings, and WAY TO SALTY to eat...left one on the plate.  Fried green tomatoes were SO OVERLY THICK they were uncooked inside.  Doubt the chef has ever eaten good ones?  Tuna appetizer was overly expensive, and had only a five very small bites of tuna.  I only bring issues such as these to the chef \"IF\" i think there is hope.  I paid the check including a generous tip for excellent waitress service and left quietly, never to return.",

    "text": "The wife and I tried Vine American Kitchen on a Friday night around 8pm. There was no wait as many of the tables were empty. The service was very good and we really enjoyed the ambiance. The interior is nicely appointed and feels a bit upscale.   The food was also very good. We started with the cornbread, which is drizzled with honey/sugar and could easily be eaten for dessert. For dinner, I had a flatbread pizza with barbecued chicken and cheddar cheese and she tried the filet mignon with baked potato, both served in good portions. A prior reviewer mentioned the up-charge for the skillet mac and cheese and he was right. We substituted this side for the asparagus that normally comes with the filet. Despite the fact that each side is priced at $5.95 a la carte, we were advised there would be an additional charge of $3 \"because the mac and cheese comes in a whole skillet.\" That simply does not make sense but it was delicious anyway.   The only thing that kept this review from getting five stars was the price of the cocktails. I had two Maker's Manhattans, normally priced between $7 - $10 depending on the restaurant. I was quite disappointed when our bill read $27 for the two drinks. Yikes! Good thing the wife is pregnant and just drinking water these days. I did see that draft beers were around $5 so I'll probably choose beer next time.   We look forward to coming back to Vine in the near future.",

I got an anemic \"tall\" (ounce wise could not have been more than 8oz.) with one lime.  Had to ask for the second one which took a while.   ordered the ribs with the cole slaw and sweet potato fries.  The sides were delicious. The sweet potato fries were a little sweet with the extra sugar on them, but I ate them all!!   The ribs, hmmm.  They were a hair on the tough side and extremely small.  The bones were maybe 2-1/2\" long.  Then there was a huge strip of fat along one side of the rack.  Overall, very expensive for just ok food and service.",

Me, my girlfriend, and another person we were with all ordered steaks. Mine and my friends came out well done when we ordered medium rare. My girlfriend ordered medium well and got medium rate. They ran out of baked potatoes and brought us mashed potatoes instead. Minor note but still. We had ours sent back and it took close to 10 to 15 minutes to get it back, so everyone was almost done. The manager came back and offered us a free soup or salad but I declined because of the size of my steak. Ultimately, they just forgot about it and we paid full price for below average steaks with little taste, after waiting for close to 15 minutes. I don't foresee us going back there because of it.",

Bartender seemed annoyed that we where even there. Had the personality of a pea.  My date ordered, she got it wrong, perhaps she should have listened.  Not a smile, hi how are you.... I can get a better welcome a chain restaurant.  My favorite was when my date asked for the bill.  She tossed a paper receipt to him in a get out kinda way.  I have been a server for years on and off.  Are you not supposed to place it in a book and pass it to the patron??? We did share the crab cakes which where delicious with 2 sides.  Will go again, but not the bar...",

We coincidentally met up with an even larger group of people in the bar prior to dinner, all of whom also just happened to be there that night.  The place was pretty dead for 8pm on a Saturday night, but yet I still had to wave down our server *for ever drink round* in order to keep the fun going.  I would have estimated that server likely could have gotten 2-3 more rounds out of our group -- a sizable bar order -- had he just been doing a serviceable job that evening.    Then our party moved to a table, still in the bar area so my buddy could watch the Boston Bruins lose game 5, where we apparently had 2 servers both covering us.  But even with extra service on still a sparsely populated restaurant, we had to wait to order appetizers, wait to order dinner, waiting was the theme of the evening I am afraid.    Unfortunate thing is, the food was pretty good.  I had an ahi tuna special and the tuna was indeed fresh and seared very well.  The bruschetta appetizer was great.  I actually liked the thicker-cut bread that wasn't overly crunchy.  My wife greatly enjoyed her salad; the entire table enjoyed every dish that was ordered as a matter of fact.  Everything, that is, except the lousy service.  I would not come back here unless I hear the service greatly improves.  The food was very good, but not so good as to overcome the poor service.  Hopefully I am wrong because I like having more dining options in my area, but unless something changes dramatically I expect this restaurant to have the same fate as its predecessors.",

Our waiter disappeared and only refilled our small water glasses once for the rest of the night. Multiple orders came out very cold. When we finally received warm food, it still wasn't very good.

The waitress raved about the ribs only to then tell us after we ordered that they were out (we had a 6:30 reservation on a Sat) - how does that happen??  Then one order came out wrong.  The shrimp pasta dish didn't taste anything like what the menu described and was pretty weak.  It's really too bad because the ambiance and location is good but the only good thing between the 4 of us was the wine and the company.  I would NOT recommend NOR would I go back.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited The Vine for the first time on Saturday. The decor was nice and relaxing. The food was average at best for the price. The menu selections were very basic and not what I was expecting. The menu is basically flatbreads, burgers, sandwiches and two fish dishes. We had the fried green tomatoes for our appetizer. The breading on the tomatoes was too thick and under seasoned.  I ordered the flounder and I asked for no mushrooms and it promptly arrived with tons of mushrooms. The fish was warm and soggy. When our waitress came over to check on us and saw me removing the unwanted item she couldn't leave the table quick enough. My wife had the crake cakes which were very good but they were like a crab imperial.  The dessert was key lime pie, which was good.  The pie had a cream cheese topping as well as whipped cream, but our waitress told us it was only whipped cream.  She was very wrong.  Overall it was below average, probably won't go back when we could spend that money at Aria, Upstream, Osso, etc.  If I wanted 521 type dinner, I would stay closer to the house.",

    "text": "I am giving Vine two stars because the atmosphere was great and the food, once we received it was good. We had a reservation for Mother's Day so we expected it to be busy and a little slower. What we experienced was terrible service and a restaurant that was completely unprepared. We started out good and ordered drinks and an appetizer for the table. Some drinks arrived but we were told they were out of the appetizer. We then ordered our food and noticed my parents never received their water. We asked for their water and then after a reasonable amount a time a server came out and put a plate in front of my mother. It was what she ordered. Another server then came a took it away giving it to the table next to us because that is where it was supposed to go. 30 minutes after we ordered our food had not yet arrived. The manager came over and apologized and suggested we order some desserts on the house. The server and manager must not have communicated well because he then came and told us lunch was on them. He was wrong. Our food finally arrived and it was good. We had to ask for several missing items that were never brought out. My husbands water glass was never refilled so he started drinking mine. We waited a long time for them to finally bring us dessert menus. We ordered three desserts for our group of 7 and asked for the check since we were tired of waiting. The server finally noticed my husband needed water and said he would bring it. He never did. Twenty minutes later our server reappeared to tell us they were out of one of the desserts. We said we didn't need any dessert and just wanted the check. It arrived with desserts on the bill as well as three extra beverages that we did not order. The check was finally fixed and we were given two desserts to go for our trouble. I hardly think it was compensation. Lunch took us over two hours. Management should have been more proactive and apologetic.",

I had the slow cooked ribs which needless to say were nothing short of amazing. The wait staff was very attentive and never had to ask for anything which is highly unusual as I drink a lot of water. Wine list is huge and my girlfriend tried something new as per our waiters suggestion. My girlfriend said she loved which she never tries anything new so that surprised me. Fireplace was awesome and romantic great place to take a date. Definitely will be back. Next time I have to try the chefs cookies I saw it at another persons table and I was mad at myself that I get it.",

Midway through our meal, a server brought us a plate of fried green tomatoes that were accidentally made. We really appreciate the fact that the restaurant attempts to control waste in this way.

    "text": "We tried Vine the first week it opened for lunch, and it was good.  So, we decided to go there and try if for dinner tonight.   Very busy, which was an initial good sign.   Unfortunately, that was one of the few good signs for the evening. - The waiter started by asking us if we had been there before, and when we said we had, he said it was \"unusual to have repeat visitors.\" - 2 of us ordered filet medium, which came out well done.   I give the manager credit for offering to redo the steaks, but since the flavor was still good, we decided to keep them versus waiting for new steaks.  One of the baked potatoes was lukewarm, so we sent it back.   The potato they brought back was exactly the same.   As for the steaks relative to the price, they were small, thin filets for the price....$29 for the entree. - I ordered the jambalaya.   It was average, with the prominent flavor being salt. - To make up for the overdone steaks, they did offer us a free desert.   Nice gesture, but for a new restaurant, I would suggest they offer a gift certificate and ask us to come back and give them another chance, plus a comp for at least one of the meals. - When the waiter went through the dessert options, he said that the key lime pie was \"standard, nothing fancy\".   - the wine list was good, with a wide selection and price points.   We decided to order a Washington State wine that was very good.    In summary, there are many choices in the south Charlotte area that have better food at a lower price point.   Vine American Kitchen may end up being a good after work scene, but they have some work to do in order to compete with the other food options in the area.",

    "text": "Have been to Vine a few times now since it has opened.  It is quickly gaining a reputation as a hot spot to be and it will be interesting to see if they can hang on to that after they have been open a little longer.  I love the fireplace room where you can go and lounge and have a cocktail, or even book for a company event.  The menu to me is great as it has something for everyone.  Vine has a high class atmosphere, where you can order a few drinks, filet mignon or fish, and spend 100 dollars, or you can order an amazing burger or a chicken sandwhich and have a couple of beers for 20 dollars.  The bar has TV's positioned so that no matter where you are sitting you will be able to view any even that is currently on.  I definitely enjoy the food here, the drinks are a tad pricy(makers mark on the rocks $10), but the atmosphere is easily one of the top in the area.  The outdoor patio is great with fire pits that you can sit around.  It can get a little noisy when it is crowded, and lately happy hour has been very crowded.  The bar could use a little more space between the dining side wall and the bar, as when it is crowded the wait staff will need the space to get by, but usually that is not too much of a problem.  Overall I view Vine as a spot I will be visiting regularly in Ballantyne as the atmosphere is hard to match and the food is excellent.",

The young lady that was bar tending,not real friendly but got the job done. We were only asked by another bartender if we wanted another glass, but at that time we were heading to our table. Our server, Alena was wonderful! Friendly, helpful, and entertaining! She was really good about checking back with us, kept our glasses full, and opens a bottle of wine very smoothly.  We started with the blue cheese chips that were very good! I had the ribs, nicely done. Husband had the prime rib which was the special, that was also good & cooked perfectly. Friends had the chicken pasta & a burger. Plates were cleaned!  Even though we were stuffed we had to go for dessert as well. We ordered both the butterscotch chocolate pie & the cherry bread pudding with ice cream. Yummy!

At first I was a bit put off by having to give my credit card number to make a reservation...pretty ridiculous to be charged for cancelling a reservation. A minor setback, but if you're making a reservation for a large party be sure you show up. The inside is exactly like 131 Main or Firebirds; dark, open, comfortable and slightly loud. Both the wine menu and the food menu is of decent size and offers a decent amount of options. The food was excellent though, but a little pricey for the amount you got. Most of the entrees I would have thought were $5-$10 overpriced, appetizers $2-$4 overpriced. No bread was given on the table which also surprised me. All in all it was very good food, nice atmosphere, average service but just a little overpriced. Dinner for two with wine will cost you about $85-$90 before tip.",

Our waiter was extremely irritating and bothersome while waiting for us to decide what to order.   I guess because they weren't busy, he had nothing better to do but to hassle us.    My friend and I both ordered the French dip.    It arrived about 5 mins later - which was a surprise.   I took off the top of the bun to remove some of the beef and the meat was freezing cold - practically had ice crystals on it.    We sent them back and were told they would make new ones and a man, that I assume was the manager, came by and apologized.    About another 5 mins went by and the waiter brought new French dips.  This time they were barely warm - I have NEVER been served a COLD  French Dip.   The waiter and the manager came by and asked if it was better.    I told them \"not really\" but just nevermind.    The constant interruptions were really getting on our nerves and by this point, we just wanted to be left alone.   The waiter came back again and said the \"chef\" said it was barely warm because if he warmed it any longer the beef would be well done.      I told him I WANTED it well done but just nevermind - it was fine.   again - I was tired of talking about it.    Then one of them came by AGAIN and said next time I order the French Dip, just to let them know I wanted it well done.   I wanted to say - \"there won't be a next time!!!!!\"      I also think they should tell people up front when they order the French Dip, \"the chef likes to leave the beef raw and freezing cold - is that ok? or would I prefer it actually warm and cooked?\"   The only good part of the lunch was that they cut the bill 50%.     My friend and I agreed that we won't be going back there!",

The poor service we received tonight negated any enjoyment we received from the food. When I spend that kind of money on food and drink, I expect adequate (not even stellar) service. It took forever for our initial drink order to arrive and then I had to summon the waiter after an excessive wait to place an order for food. We felt ignored the entire time we were there. Clearly there was a problem somewhere - a shortage of wait staff and perhaps also in the kitchen. I sat there and watched our waiter engage with other patrons, make small talk and check on them while we sat there waiting. It did appear that most customers were waiting a long time for their food and drinks. They could most definitely have done more to compensate for this - give people some bread - something! I will say that my husband's drink was incredibly weak and my cranberry margarita was almost undrinkable (and I like my drinks strong and sour!). Maybe if someone had made me feel like they cared about me as a customer, I would have given them a pass this time and not be writing this review. I feel like I just flushed over $100 down the toilet. After this, I don't know if I'll be back or not.",

The rice arrived undercooked but the server was exceptional in offering alternatives. However, the manager made a less than cursory stop by the table and had no interest in the fact that a side item was not cooked properly, nor did she even offer an apology. Kudos to the wait staff for doing an acceptable job, however I will not be returning for this overpriced and pre-packaged food item menu.",

The food was good -- not out-of-this world -- but definitely a good value for what we paid. Our $30 Queen's Feast meals included a glass of wine/craft beer, a salad, entree, and dessert. I had the house chardonnay. It wasn't very dry, an easy drinker. I chose the Vine salad and felt like it could've used a little bit more in the topping department. The variety of toppings was good, but it was sparse and I had leftover greens. Next, I ordered the baked crab cakes with cole slaw and fries. I found the crab cakes to be tasty, just wished there was a tad more sauce. The cole slaw was refreshing, but there was an herb/spice in it that's just not for me. The fries were hot and fresh, but could've used a little more seasoning. The cheesecake was delicious. Overall, it was a great experience and meal. I'm just nit-picking for the food snobs out there. ;)",

Overall good service, food arrived very quickly...are they looking for more table turns?  But server didn't rush us, mgr stopped to see if things were good.  Food was good, had roast beef wife had the pasta.    One criticism is their wine is overpriced IMOP. I found bottle prices to be 2 1/2 - 3 times normal retail. And even though it was 1/2 price wine night it was not a good value.  Urge management to consider a more reasonable pricing plan.    Would recommend and will return.  Good addition to the area.",

I loved the way you could see the chef cooking the food from your table and the \"Barrel Room\" my group had which is a private room inside the restaurant was nice and cozy. instead of solid walls most of the room was surrounded by glass but you had the option to make it more private by closing the curtain. The food was also phenomenal! Our group had an opportunity to try several appetizers and wine.  My favorites are the Southwestern Guacamole which was chunky and tasty. The New Orleans BBQ Shrimp was fantastic the sauce that is placed over it is amazing. The Maytag blue cheese chips and  fried green tomatoes were great as well. The Vine also has a great wine selection. The food and the private room we had were amazing but none of this would have been possible without the server we had, her name is Alex and her service was on point from start to finish. She consistently checked on our group and had a pleasant demeanor and was very knowledgeable if we had questions about the menu. She also made sure that our glasses were always full and kept our group's table very organized. I was very pleased with the service Alex provided along with the food that was served. Let's just say that I'll be back to this place very soon! P.S. Thanks again Alex for making our experience at Vine memorable!",

When we walked In we were told by the friendly hostess that there  was a 25 minute wait so we decided to go grab a drink at the bar. When we noticed there were seats at the bar right away we decided to just sit and have dinner at the bar.  We found two seats facing the whole restaurant which was spacious as well as great for people watching :).  Our bartenders greeted us quickly and were very attentive our whole stay.  We started with the crab cake appetizer which was delicious. All lump crab no filler.  Not enough for a meal but an excellent starter. We ordered the blackened shrimp salad with no bacon and dressing on the side.   It was very flavorful with its jalapeno buttermilk ranch dressing.  I do prefer the shrimp to be cooked a little more but it was still quite tasty with the egg, avocado and blue cheese. We also got the blackened salmon sandwich with fries. The salmon was topped with fried onions which were tasty and was cooked and seasoned perfectly. During our dinner two managers came by to see how everything was going which is always nice.  Our dinner was great if we lived in the area we would frequent Vine as regulars.",

    "text": "WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! Just finished my dinner ordered for take out.  It was good...not great, but I normally wouldn't complain.  Here's the problem.  Ordered on the phone at 5:59pm and was told it would be ready in ~20 minutes.  Having severe pelvic pain in the last weeks of my pregnancy and a small infant already really didn't want to have to wait.  We took our time and arrived to pick up our food at 6:27.  My husband went in and found nothing ready behind the bar.  We waited for over 20 minutes as the order was slowly put together.  Was it ever made ahead of time?  Who knows. We drive away and not 3 minutes down the road I get a phone call...  apparently my husband was informed he was supposed to wait because the chicken was not yet ready on the salad - he still says he was not told such a thing.  We turn the car around and the whole time the manager refuses to apologize or claim any wrong doing whatsoever.  He says that they had to re-grill the chicken 3 times because it kept drying out waiting in the window for us.  Even if this is True, it takes 8 minutes to grill a chicken breast - confirmed by the manager himself - even if they grilled it when he arrived at the restaurant at 6:27 it would have been ready by 6:35.  Not 6:55 when I eventually walked away with the food.  The manager insisted this was quality control and literally was chasing me out of the restaurant claiming this and NOT APOLOGIZING until I turned around and asked him to stop because I didn't want to curse. My favorite part....I get home open the containers of food to eat and find my rainbow trout is totally dried out.  Great job on that quality control!!  $46 later - what  great experience.  Thanks Vine American Kitchen, I'll surely be back for more.",

Walked in at 7:30 needing a table for 12 (someone in our group thought we had reservations, but they were not expecting us - not sure what happened there, could have easily been our fault).  Nevertheless, they were able to accommodate us and we proceeded to enjoy a good meal with very good service.    The special of the day was seafood pasta, but at 7:30, only two servings were left which seemed a bit odd, but we took both and they were enjoyed.  The pork chop looked very good, but both people who had it said it was \"just OK\", so not sure what happened there.  I had the Gumbo, which again, was \"OK\".  The other pasta dishes were enjoyed - certainly didn't see much food left over that's for sure.  My comment at the time was I've been to New Orleans too much of late to order Gumbo elsewhere.  Service, again, was really good - not exactly who the main server was as many approached and helped with our tabled, but for a large group they did a very nice job. Their bar did a really job - serving some unusual cocktail specials.   Overall, fairly reasonably priced, good food, very good atmosphere and a warm friendly staff.  I would go back.",

My husband...who's dined here before, was excited to bring me here. He loves the food!   I normally make reservations on Open Table. Unfortunately, Vine wasn't listed on the app. Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find a table.   We arrive around 6:30, the hostess seated us right away. I noticed the booths have a high back, giving each table a more intimate setting. Our waitress was very informative about the menu and specials.  I definitely appreciate the staff here! Several managers and other waitstaff attended to our needs......can you say \"Team work\". We were seated next to the wine cellar refrigerators, which were illuminated on green lighting.  Food: This is the best part  We started with the Calamari with banana peppers. I ordered a glass of The Biltmore Estate Sauvignon Blanc!! I Highly recommend this to anyone!!!! My entree, I ordered The Blackened Shrimp Salad with a side of Truffle Fries! My husband ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with a bowl of Tomato Bisque and Side salad. Dessert? Cupid Kiss Cocktail and Banana Bread Pudding!! Everything was Delicious! Cooked to perfection!!   This was the perfect Date night for us!! I loved every moment!!! Thank you to everyone at Vine American Kitchen! You guys made our evening sparkle! I definitely look forward to coming here again soon! Hopefully for brunch with my girlfriends! Or maybe even happy hour. But I'm not sure if that's something they offer. Either way, I look forward to another great experience.",

Unfortunately the worst part of dining out is paying the bill - it seems like you sit forever waiting for the waiter to come to take your money. That's exactly what happened tonight. Ronald walked by numerous times and oblivious to our need to pay and leave. For this and the outrageous prices I won't be back. I'll go to Firebirds where I get a much better selection of steaks and better prices.",

She presented the special Valentine's Day menu to us and walked us through the drink options. Since it was our first visit, I asked her about some of the fan favorites or top picks on the menu.  We had a flatbread as an appetizer that was hot and delicious. I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcakes (recommended by Caitlin) and my wife had Cajun Jumbalaya. The crab cakes were phenomenal. They had just enough breading to keep them together, but not enough to make them heavy. The slaw that came with them was very light, clean, and fresh tasting. My wife said the Jumbalaya was very good and tasty. She brought half of it home, it was decent size portion.  The overall menu offers a wide variety for every taste or preference. The drink menu is also strong with plenty wine, beer, and cocktail options if that is something you enjoy.  We sat right outside the open kitchen, so it was a bit noisey, but definitely not too bad.",

They have a good sized bar, though I must say, they could work on pouring better drinks. (The Lemondrop Martini tasted like pure syrup and a Baby Guiness shot didn't even fill up 1/4 of the shot glass and was double the price compared to other bars in the area). The service is pretty good, however one evening when they had a packed house, the service was horrible but I will not blame a whole restaurant on one waitress. The food is good, nothing spectacular, but you will not be disappointed. Oh and very good prices! Can't beat that. Would be a great location to host a private event in one of their private rooms.",

The interior reminds me of 131 Main, not too far away.  I had the crab cakes lunch.  Crab cakes were excellent - good chunks of crab meat, cooked perfectly.  They were a little on the small side, but it was adequate for lunch.  The Napa slaw was very good, but there was a huge portion of that on the plate.  I opted to upgrade my side to the skillet mac & cheese.  This was very tasty, but the up-charge was $4, which I thought was a little steep for that (the fries that come with the lunch are listed at $3.95 as a side item, the mac & cheese was $5.95, the up-charge should be $2 at most, right?).  I finished the lunch with the coconut cupcake.  I am very wary of coconut desserts as they tend to be overly sweet.  Not the case here, this coconut cupcake was perfect - the \"cake\" part was more like a shortcake than a cupcake.  The icing was a creamy toasted coconut, just sweet enough.  Perfection.  While I didn't have any drinks for lunch, I noticed that their wine selection and \"by the glass\" selections were excellent.",

Their grilled cheese sandwich is masterful and the fact that they have this great bar right by the outdoors (which in the summer they open up) makes the environment a lot of fun.  To top it off, the butterscotch chocolate chip pie is the perfect ending to the perfect night, as long as they heat it hot enough.  A few times it hasn't been.  But they're always willing to take it back and correct it.  Another great mention is the wine list is very fair in prices with a tremendous selections.",

    "text": "I have been here twice since they opened, and they would have gotten 5 stars, which I never give, however, there is one aspect that they need some major improvement on.  Lets start with the good stuff: -the building itself is very attractive from the outside, and only gets better when you go in.  It is warm and inviting, rustic and modern, all at the same time.  Mostly all booths, which is awesome, because everyone always wants a booth.  They have a large room up front with a fireplace and some couches and chairs, but not sure exactly what the purpose of that room is, and they also have a private dining room as well, and a great bar area. -the servers are awesome!  Knowledgeable, friendly, professional, nicely dressed, and very attentive. -the food is incredible!   American basics done extremely well.  The flatbreads, cornbread, burgers, chicken pasta....all five stars!   Huge variety of beer and wine, and the desserts make your mouth water just looking at them! -prices are very reasonable for the freshness and quality you get.  Now, for the bad news, and an issue that could bring the entire place down if they don't correct it soon......the hostesses and greeting.  Last Saturday night I called at 11am to make a reservation for restaurant week.  The girl told me that they had filled all those, but could come and eat off the regular menu.  I tried to make a reservation and she said they don't take them but do accept call-ahead.  I called at 5:45pm for a 6:30 arrival.  The rude girl on the phone said they were not on a wait, so they couldn't accept a call-ahead, so call before we come.  I called again 10 minutes later, and the rude lady said they were on a 45 minute wait (in just 10 minutes time??), and reluctantly took my call ahead.  We arrived at 6:30pm, couldn't find a place to park, and when we entered the waiting area was packed full.  We approached the rude lady at the hostess stand (don't know her name) and told her we had a call-ahead.  She didn't even react, handed us a buzzer, and sighed.  After 45 minutes, I went back up and asked what was going on, and she just said they were very busy and shrugged her shoulders, and immediately turned to the other hostess next to her and started talking as if we didn't exist.  After 1 hour and 15 minutes, I went back up to her and asked if we were going to be seated ever, and she said it shouldn't be much longer.  When I expressed my discouragement and told her that we had called ahead as instructed, she said \"call ahead is just a courtesy\".  Wow.  I didn't know that as customers we were inconveniencing the restaurant by going there and spending money.  Then, after 1 hour and 40 minutes, we were finally sat.  Whew!    Clearly, they have many aspects down nicely, but possibly the most important thing is the greeting both over the phone and in person by the hostesses, and in this respect, they are terrible.  The hostesses (or at least the one we were dealing with) was rude, short, seemed confused and over-whelmed, and generally could not have cared one way or the other if anyone that came in was waited on and greeted properly, and she obviously could have cared less if anyone actually stayed.  i wonder if she realizes that her bad attitude and obvious lack of training could keep people from coming back?    I know that I will have to think about coming back again, even though the servers and food are excellent, I am not sure I want to deal with chaos and rudeness again just to get it, when there are MANY other places in Ballantyne that can provide good food AND good service.  After spending almost $200 on dinner, I feel as if I was taken advantage of, just because of the confusion and attitude at the front.",

Try The Vine if you want to but my experience will unlikely bring me back. 131 Main St. is a far better choice, always friendly, helpful, food is great and consistant .",

Several people I was dining with got the prime rib which looked amazing. I think they only serve it on specific nights. Sorry I missed exactly when that was but we were there on a Thursday night. The service was great. I'll definitely be back!",

To our surprise, the Chef came out of the kitchen and explained how to make at home, although held the spice proportions as a restaurant secret (Gotta respect that!)  I hate to give them only 3 stars, but this is for one specific reason:  Their beer on tap just tastes off.  I don't know if it is a failure to clean the taps, old kegs, or residual soap in the glasses.  I gave up drinking their draft beer and have been ordering bottled beer instead.  I haven't had dinner here in a while, but based on the happy hour menu, I am sure it still would be a positive experience.",

They took the steak back and brought another one in about 5 mins which was completely raw, not even edible. They took it off the bill.  Good wine list everything else was pretty bad. If want a relaxing dinner with the food cooked right, go to firebirds or 131. The lack of basic service and having to get aggravated at that point matched up with the empty restaurant.

It was just ok as it seemed like they had just pulled it out an extremely cold refrigerator as it was a tad difficult to slice through and did not slice smoothly. The crust was also entirely too thick and many people did not eat the crust at our table. The staff was good for the most part except they gave a coworker's burger who ordered theirs as rare as possible to the wrong person.

    "text": "Went for Sunday brunch at 10:30, had to wait a few minutes for them to open the doors. The nice part of being the first/only people there is that you have your pick of seats. We chose outside. The temp was nice but the sun in our eyes got old. The umbrellas are very petite and not quite appropriate for the space. Most of my neighbors have patio umbrellas larger than the mini ones at Vine-they could stand to be upgraded.   We ordered beignets to start. They were good but not awesome. A little lighter and less doughy than True Cafe du Monde beignets, and lacking the thick layer of powdered sugar on top.  Several table members got the apple cider pancakes and thought they were quite good. Definitely gigantic! I had the lump crabmeat hash. Again good, but definitely not awesome. The crabmeat was indeed big glorious chunks of sweet blue crab. The crabmeat chunks were mixed with brunch potatoes on the bottom, and then topped with 2 sunny side up eggs and finished with a bit of hollandaise. The hollandaise helped bring some flavor to the plate but there wasn't much of it. The blandness of all those potatoes coupled with the eggs really needed some zing to elevate it. More spice, more flavor, more sauce, more something. There was nothing to marry the crab meat to the potatoes and eggs, so I found myself eating the crab by itself and then I was just left with boring potatoes and eggs.  By the time we left almost 2 hours later, the restaurant was about 1/4-1/3 full. Definitely not as busy as I'd expect for a brunch spot on a Sunday. Overall the group was happy to try Vine for brunch but we won't be rushing back again. The menu could use more exciting and inventive brunch items and could stand to get away from so many basics. Basic pancakes, basic breakfast sandwich, basic eggs & bacon. Even the apple cider pancakes looked boring as there was no finesse- no fresh whipped cream, etc. sort of just items slapped on a plate. And how can there be no French toast on a brunch menu?!",

One of the waiters was rude and didn't seem interested in making sure we had what we needed at all. In addition, he initially refused to give us the kids menu, though we had already ensured ahead of time that a kids menu would be available. Once we requested the manager, he returned not with the manager, but with a kids menu. Really?! The brunch menu is also not one of the stronger ones in Charlotte. One group in our party also ordered the beignets (which are normally fantastic) but someone in the kitchen accidentally covered them in flour instead of powdered sugar. When they brought it to the waiter's attention, he argued them down that nothing was wrong with them. Only after taking them back to the kitchen did he come back out and apologize.  I will likely return to Vine, ONLY because I have had great experiences before. However, many people in my party who had not been there before will likely not return.",

Our server managed the tickets so that my \"to go\" meal was ready when we finished, so it was hot when I left the restaurant.  Our server even brought me a drink refill in a to-go container.  It was a really enjoyable restaurant experience.  Now, this is where it gets weird.  I left the server a large tip for extraordinay service.  He didn't put the tip through as a charge - maybe he thought I made a mistake   No, Josh -- you earned it, and I meant to leave that much.

    "text": "Just want to point out that Vine has yet to receive a 5-star review. It's pretty clear to me now. We went as a last minute choice for my dad's birthday. We've never been to this building (I say building because it has been so many different restaurants over the years). I would figure this place gets plenty of traffic as it is situated right in the heart of Ballantyne. It wasn't full, though, on the Saturday night we went. In fact, I'd say only 50-75% of the seats were taken.  We were promptly seated and seen by a few different waiters before actually getting \"our\" waitress. I ordered ribs, my dad a hamburger, my sister chicken, and my mom salmon. After about 20 minutes, the food came out. Interestingly enough, my hand towel for my ribs came out 10 minutes before any food was served...which doesn't really make sense.   The food came out, and the first thing I noticed was how hard my ribs were. Usually, you can take a knife and break apart the ribs like melted butter, but this time, I had to bend back a rib, and cut it before it came apart. The meat was tough--possibly overcooked? I pointed this out, and it was quickly taken back. A new plate of ribs arrived about 15 minutes later, which was MUCH better, but still not great. While soft, there were fat nubs on the ends, and the sauce wasn't great. I think they were short ribs which are usually of lesser quality than baby back, which I was annoyed about. If I'm paying $19 for ribs (or whatever it was), I'd like good quality ribs.  They gave us a free dessert because of the ribs. We got the banana cream pie, which was just bad. The pie crust was not good at all, I took a bite and was done. Everyone else said their dinner was average as well.  Would I come back? Doubtful--this place left me unimpressed.",

We had been traveling all day and wanted something light for our main course. Every entree looked good but we went for salads. I had the BBQ chicken salad which was outstanding. I would go back just for the salad again. The other salad we had was very forgettable and wouldn't go for it again. It had chicken, fresh greens, asparagus and roasted red peppers. Overall the atmosphere fit the style of food and we felt the drinks were very overpriced for the location. 4/5 just for the crab cakes and BBQ salad.",

The waitress we had didn't seem to interested in serving us even though we were seated in their Barrel Room. She would show up for a couple of moments then wouldn't be seen for another 15 to 20 minutes. I ran out of water on many occasions and all we could do was laugh because it had become ridiculous. The food was decent but not enough to make me want to come back with my wife on a private dining experience of our own.   I personally had the Atlantic Salmon even though I'm not a fan of farm raised salmon and how they're raised but because their menu didn't seem to inspire much confidence in anything else. The salmon was well prepared and the mashed potatoes were fine but oily.  My wife had the All Natural Rotisserie Chicken and she liked  the entree but didn't eat all of it; not because of portion size but because she also couldn't find anything else on the menu to order. So, Yes we settled.  Did I mention the waitress didn't show up to refill water glasses or check in on our party to see if everything was fine? Well, she didn't and well that's really all I can say about her. Otherwise, we had a wonderful time joking, laughing and getting to know new people who recently joined the company my wife works for. And if you're wondering whether I would recommend this restaurant to you...I wouldn't. I know there are better restaurants in the Ballantyne area and you would do well to check them out unless you're a risk taker.",

We were seated right away - the restaurant is fairly large and there are plenty of tables.   One thing I noticed is that the water glasses are pretty small.  They bring water in a bottle  to your table, but with 4 people drinking it, it ran out pretty quickly. (The water bottle is not large & sort of looks like a wine bottle... which looked nice but wasn't very efficient.) Oh well, no big deal, they were pretty good about coming back and bringing more water as needed.   So, onto the food.... I ordered the vine salad (Field greens, cucumber, grape tomato, goat cheese, toasted almonds and white balsamic dressing) and I decided to add salmon to it.  Salads come served with a slice of Jalapeno Cornbread (which is skillet-baked with roasted corn, cilantro, and jalapeno butter).  The salad and cornbread were very good and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  ($7 for the salad plus $6 for salmon to give you an idea of price-point).   The service was ok, although our server forgot to bring one item that a co-worker had requested.  Overall though, I think everyone was pleased with their food and there were no major mis-steps, so we all agreed that we would like to go back and try more of the yummy sounding items on the menu.",

    "text": "We went to Vine on a Saturday evening around 6:30.  I had seen some other reviews about long waits, but we were seated right away.  The interior has a dark, cozy feel to it that's very similar to 131 Main as other reviews have stated.  The bar area looked like it had some comfy couches, TVs, etc., and the dining area was upscale casual - great for date night or a family outing.  As to the reviews about Vine not accommodating large parties, I didn't see any seating larger than a 4-person booth.  Our server (Lauren?) was fast and friendly and had some good recommendations.    We got the BBQ shrimp appetizer, which was solid.  I got a Pear and Bleu Cheese salad with chicken for my entree, and my fella got the salmon and asparagus.  The food was cooked well and was pretty tasting.  For all that and 3 glasses of wine, it was about $75, which seemed a smidgen pricey, but not terrible for a weekend night out.    All in all, Vine seems like a great addition to a neighborhood that seems to either have super casual restaurants (Bad Daddy's, Mellow Mushroom, Duckworth's) or super fancy restaurants (Global, Gallery).  I hope it sticks around since that location has been tricky for other places in the past.",

    "text": "Tried another round at the Vine - was Sunday brunch and was lucky enough to have a lady bug cooked right into my omelette. Waitress took it away and said \"so sorry, I'll speak with my manager\" - after nearly 5 minutes, it was apparent the manager wanted to stay away from a conflict so the waitress popped over and said \"they're making you a new omelette\" (I found it rather presumptuous to assume I'd want another after seeing a baked in lady bug in my first attempted omelette)! No thanks. Waitress dodged us like the plague after that but ran by saying the manager would be over to apologize. Manager did come over and gave a gift card to make it right. I wasn't angry or disgruntled, but when she asked if there was anything else she could get us, I simply responded, \"our check\" - 5 minutes after that, the waitress said we had no check - (again, good effort in making it right). I really WANT to like the Vine, but it's a done deal for me. No more and I'm really quite disappointed that I can't win there.",

There's only 5 shrimp, but it comes with bread to sop up the sauce - in my opinion that was the best part.   For dinner I got the Lump Crab Cakes. These were probably the best crab cakes I've ever eaten and I'm from New England. It came with Napa Slaw and fries, which were good, but not my favorite. I also ordered the skillet Mac and cheese, which was great also.   For dessert I got the new Oreo ice cream cookie sandwich. It was gigantic, so share. The vanilla ice cream was alright and wasn't the best, but that's the only criticism I have.   To drink I got the Chateau Wells Chardonnay and it paired well perfectly the entire meal.   Highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Vine for awhile, and now that we've moved to the South side of town I had my chance. The restaurant itself is very open and attractive. The booths are a bit on the small side when it comes to leg room, but overall comfortable. Our server was friendly and attentive. On a Sunday evening it was fairly empty, so you probably wouldn't need a reservation.   I ordered the ribeye with haricots verts and mashed potatoes. My husband had the roast chicken, macaroni and cheese, and a baked potato. His meal was definitely the better choice. The macaroni and cheese was served in a small skillet and the baked potato had a nice salt crust on the skin. My husband seemed to really enjoy everything, and from the bites I tried his was really tasty. My medium rare steak was overcooked and under-seasoned. I hate sending back something like that, but at nearly $30 I really wanted to get something I'd enjoy. Sadly the second time the steak was still not medium-rare but by then I was too hungry to complain, so I just ate it. As far as sides go the mashed potatoes were good but I'd skip the green beans, as they weren't anything special.   Overall I would return (specifically to try the Coconut Cake on the menu), but I wouldn't order the steak.",

    "text": "Vine American Kitchen, not sure where to begin.  I arrived at noon on Sunday, just in time for Bloody Mary time.  As I pulled into the parking lot there weren't too many cars so I was a little reluctant, but decided to go with my gut and give it a try.  Great design, with TVs, nice bar, but a little dark for brunch/lunch dining, but I can get their look for a nice dinner experience. Upon being seated I was greeted by a very sweet girl who took my drink order, water with lemon and a bloody mary.  The water was delivered and she said the drink was on its way, which it arrived not a minute or two later.   After reviewing the menu, I decided to get the Ballantyne Chicken Sandwich with homemade chips, which the waitress recommended. After ordering I \"checked in\" on Yelp and took a drink, whoa!!! Wholly whoa! All the drink was was pepper, with a old dirty brown piece of celery.  I stirred the drink and added some ice from water and it was overall okay. I love a kick, but this was not a good Bloody Mary kick, rather a PEPPER kick! My food arrived, and I pointed out the celery and asked that she replace it, which she did.  The chicken sandwich was pulled chicken with a red pepper aioli, red onions and arugula on a kaiser roll.  The pulled chicken was good, however, very bland. The kaiser roll was so soggy that I had to take the entire bottom off and only ate the top of the bun. However, the homemade chips, so good. I did add a little salt, but dipped in ketchup, too die for. Overall I thought the service was great, but the food could use some seasoning. I definitely will get back to try a few other items on the menu and will update my review if I feel it deserves better than an 'OK'. For now, that is where my thoughts stand.",

The restaurant understaffed the bar with only 2 bartenders for 24 seats and also the service bar. We had to ask for every including water when our glasses sat empty for a long time. It wasn't 100% their fault due to being understaffed. With the several salty reviews i would definitely talk with the chef at a minimum.

My boyfriend ordered salmon and it was good too. The side items were okay. But the desserts made up for them. I ordered this butterscotch chocolate chip pie. I would get that over an over again. My boyfriend ordered the cheesecake. It looked basic but was so delicious!   The service wasn't amazing, but I cut her some slack because it was Saturday night during restaurant week.

My favorite item here so far is the Blackened shrimp chopped salad.  It features many things you would expect in a cobb salad as well as avocado and 6 blackened shrimp on top.  The ranch dressing is mixed in but never overwhelms the salad like so many dressings do.  They have a daily $8.95 lunch special that changes daily.  One day it was salmon tacos and another day it was shrimp and grits.    The whole theme of the restaurant is wine.  They have wine dispensers at the bar as well as other bottled wine and often have wine specials.  Beer lovers, have no feer, they have us covered too and they have a couple of local craft beers on tap as well.  Seating can be very cozy here.  The seating in the main restaurant is mostly booths but they alternate in size.  There are a couple of separate rooms for more intimate seating - a round room to the back of the restaurant that can be closed off for groups and a smaller room behind the bar.  They have a great patio with a fire pit as well.  On my first visit, I was not really impressed with the service but it has gotten better in the next two visits.  And on my last visit, the shrimp for the salad were overcooked so there may be a little bit of inconsistency there.  But still, there are plenty of items on their menu that I still want to try so I will definitely be back.",

Much is due to our waiter, Luis, who honestly answered our questions about pricing.  He is a great server and really took care of us.  It made our evening.  Comments on manhattan cocktails:  If you \"call\" a specific brand, as one reviewer did, the price is $11.25 each. I had a Hendrics martini for $10.  WWife had a glass of merlot for $7.   Many of the cocktails we saw on their specials ranged in price from $7 - 11.  The regular drinks were reasonably prices for restaurants at around $6 for mixed drinks.  Did like the menu, one where I found at least four items I wanted to try.  That is good news.  Wife had the filet mignon wedge salad, which was quite a nice meal with plenty of meat.  I had the center-cut filet and it was of such a good quality of meat that I could have enjoyed it raw.  Cooked perfectly and the loaded potato with it was a nice filling meal.  This was a first experience and we will return as Vine is a candidate for a four or five star rating.  Ask for Luis.",
