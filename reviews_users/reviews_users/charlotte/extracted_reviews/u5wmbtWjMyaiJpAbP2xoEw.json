    "text": "Bearing in mind that Charlotte is not exactly coastal,  you wouldn't know it by the offerings at Fish Market in Baxter Village.  I've been there a few times now  {Sat lunch,  Sunday brunch &  now dinner} and am NEVER disappointed. Drinks are reasonably priced by the glass (mixed or wine) and the wine selection is great.   But it's the food you should indulge in, not alcohol. Nothing I've had has been a misstep: anything on the brunch selections,  the burgers,  she crab soup, or the seafood entrees.  If you want to feel like you're eating with sand under your feet,  this is so fresh it's straight off the fishing boat.   Chefs here know how prepare seafood too.  Shrimp are firm and succulent,  scallops are buttery and melt-in-your-mouth, the swordfish is firm and excellently seared, the she crab soup is divine, and the desserts?  Well,  hope you brought clean undies 'cuz you'll need them after dining here.   Don't worry about the service either.   Every server is well trained and knows the menu.   They also excel at providing a recommendation if needed.   All around,  this is one of my favorite places to eat and the prices are far more than reasonable for inland seafood. The meal is epic,  and you won't feel like you've broken the bank for it,  either.",

    "text": "I went to the Fish Market during the Charlotte Queen's Feast $30 prix fixe menu.  I've wanted to try Fish Market for a while but the prices have always turned me off.   I feel I didn't get what I paid for as the portions for the 3 courses were very small.  I was afraid this would happen as it tends to on prix fixe multi course menus.  We were very disappointed with the amount we received based on the price we paid.  Thankfully this wasn't the case at other restaurants we visited.  I started with the She Crab soup.  The soup was phenomenal.  I could have ate an entire meal of only this soup.  However like I mentioned above the portion was minute and I would guess I was served  less than 1/4 of a cup.  My Entree was the Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi .  The fish was ok.  I've had much flavorful Mahi Mahi at other establishments.  The lobster risotto was very good and my date's favorite dish.  The Pecan Pie tasted like a basic run of the mill store bought pie.  It was probably the largest portion of the night.  The service was inconsistent.  We received our first 2 courses in a reasonable amount of time but we rarely saw our server in between.  Our dessert was the longest wait of the night by far.  I wouldn't make it a point to come back because I don't think this was worth the money.  It's Red Lobster food at premium prices.",

His brother Gallant was the opposite.  The service was almost all Goofus.  We took two of our (grade school aged) kids put to dinner to celebrate their good grades. We picked the fish market because my husband and I had dined there in the past and the food and service were always wonderful. It seemed like a special treat! It turned out to be anything but.  We were seated by a large party.   The service was unbelievably slow. (Over 2 hours) The server explained that they were down a man In the kitchens. The server was nice enough but clearly unsupported.   The party next to us continued to get loud and unruly.  At no point did a manager reach out to us to apologize for the slow service or offer to move us away from the loud group.  As we left, I spoke with an assistant manager who told me there was nothing they could do about the loud group. He suggested that \"if you give us another chance\" we request a quiet table.  What a disappointing dinner!!",

Also, not to forget you definitely should make reservations before dining at this place. Unfortunately, we had not done that had to wait for whole 30 long minutes. However, the food and the service at this place covered up for it. We were almost about to leave after the wait and the manager quickly noticed a vacant table in the bar section. We began with CALAMARI FRIES and I would say those things really come in the size of fries. They were delicious. Wish they served more of those in the plate. Also you get complimentary bread to began with. Those were just okay. For our main course, we had CAROLINA MOUNTAIN TROUT and GRILLED MAHI MAHI. Both the entrees were well cooked and served timely. The taste was just so good. The ambiance was overall good. It would have been better however if we were not sitting right at the table by the bar section. The server later got us a variety of desert options to choose from. Key lime pie and Strawberry cheese cake were a couple. We decided to have the cheese cake and boy was that good.   I would definitely recommend a visit to the fish market. Make reservations in advance and keep in mind that this is a $$$ place.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place forever. There just aren't that many great places to eat in this end of town. So trying to be more open minded to the Ft Mill/Rivergate area. Went on a Saturday evening with a reservation at 6. Didn't really need it as the place was fairly empty but started to fill up by 7. I ordered the mussels and someone else at the table order the blackened beef bites for appetizers. Neither were great. Mussels were over cooked, very chewy and tasted to much like the \"sea\". The beef bites were flavorful yet plain. Was also served bread for the table--couldn't quite figure out the herb that was in it and the server didn't know either. We also had salads--market salad, hearts of palm and a wedge. We were all pleased with these--flavorful dressings on the market and the hearts of palm.  For dinner, I ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta. Wow! First it was enough pasta for 3 people. The shrimp and scallops tasted great. Nice sauce with artichokes. While it was a lot of food for the price, a place like this should give this dish the presentation it deserves. The shrimp and scallops, which should be the stars of the dish were buried in the sauce and pasta. I would have paid the same price for 1/3 of the pasta with the same number shrimp/scallops being highlighted on top with the sauce. Again, great dish but the presentation could be so much better. It really looked like a hot mess in a big bowl. Another at the table ordered scallops with the risotto - they were pleased with their selection and I tried the risotto and it was delicious.  Last dish ordered was the shrimp and grits, which I didn't try, but she thought it had too much sauce which drowned the other ingredients.  For dessert, we had the key lime pie, cheesecake and the trio of creme brulee. The key lime had an odd green sauce on top--it tasted odd and didn't add anything to the pie. Cheesecake was delightful. The trio of creme brulee- regular was good, chocolate was phenomenal & the pistachio was lacking in pistachio flavor ( green color doesn't = pistachio flavor) Server was really good for the most part. I asked if they had port, he mentioned something that was not a port and I declined. I think he wasn't sure what I was asking for but he did was a server should do in this instance. He went and asked someone and came back with the menu and showed me, they did in fact, have two port offerings. Good save on his part and it added to my experience. Kudos to him! I would come back, I would not order the apps we ordered or entree selection as I think there are probably a few other dishes  that would have been better.  This restaurant says all their fish is fresh and they buy local--they should play that up on their website and menu. It would further justify their price point.",

    "text": "This place is by far the BEST seafood place in SC. I started for a client near Baxters Village for a contract and told my co-workers when asked to go to lunch that I don't eat any meat other than seafood.  The response was perfect let's go to the Fish Market. The name threw me off so I responded by asking if we were still going to get lunch because my hotel didn't have a stove to cook fresh fish from a fish market. Of course they laughed and took me to The Fish Market where I was PLEASANTLY PLEASED. I've had the following and ALL are 5 stars Crab Cake sandwich - Me having lived in MD where crab cake is the BEST should know a GREAT crabcake Shrimp and Scallop Parmasen Scampi - UNBELIEVABLE Fish Taco - AMAZING Seared Diver Scallop - SUPERB  Be sure to join the club if you plan to go often, you get points per dollar and gift cards after a certain amount of points",

    "text": "I am so torn. I want to give 4 stars for their food, but positively zero stars for their service.   My fiance and another couple dined here last Saturday, yes, during Queen's Feast (restaurant week), which is why I was torn about writing this, but the service we received was just inexcusable. Yes, the seafood is fresh, and the portions are great, but what's that worth when you have poor service? We had a reservation at 8pm, and already it was clear that the hostess (who was also our server) was frazzled. She even spoke unkindly to the other server, who ultimately sat us, and was already apologizing. Then it took about 20 more minutes for our server to acknowledge us, and we ordered. Now we did not order off the restaurant week menu. Fast forward to 9pm, and we still do not have appetizers (shrimp cocktail and 2 salads). Proceed to 9:30, they finally arrive, from a different server. Still no sign of server 1 and now we have empty drinks. At this point, the restaurant is thinning out and there are empty tables all around us. We sat with empty appetizer plates until out dinners showed up at 10pm. Yes. We were sat at 8pm and did not get our dinners until 10pm. I think at this point, our server just gave up, as we had to ask a different server on the floor to get refills on our beer/wine.   Overall, to me, service outweighs the food, and I just cannot excuse the lack of service we recieved this evening. Restaurant week or not, this was poor. Ot would have been one thing if a manager came over and said we are slammed (even though at 10 the restaurant was about empty) or if our server would have said something, but instead we were ignored almost all evening long. Thank goodness for good company at least.",

    "text": "Being a frequent guest at one of your favorite restaurants gives you great insight and understanding of the food, service, atmosphere and management. I have always had great experiences at Fish Market from the food to the service. Food has always been fresh, made to order and delicious. My favorite dish tends to be the Chilean Sea Bass with Risotto, Calamari Fries as an appetizer and Creme Brulee as desert. I often vary my selections depending on what the special is that night or if I'm in the mood for something new. The service tends to be impeccable which tends to not be the case at some restaurant in the mid price range and management takes all concerns and critiques to improve.  Now with all that being said, you're looking at my 3 star rating and saying to yourself, \"well what happened?\". What happened is my last visit, my daughter who turned 8 years old wanted to go here for her birthday out of all places for a child. Unfortunately for my family we had a new server who wasn't competent in taking orders, updating us on arrival of appetizers, meals, etc. She wasn't able to refill out water glasses without being asked, she didn't come back to check in on us like she was too busy doing something else and didn't have a sense of making our daughters birthday special. The appetizers came out cold and we asked to have them redone, she suggested to just warm them up. The food took about 40 minutes to come out and yes we had the experience of having other diners come in after us - order their food, finish their food and ask for the check before we got our dinner with a different server. The restaurant was not busy that night btw.  I asked to speak with the manager and when he came, he came with the intention of not listening to us but to tell us what he thought we wanted to hear, which was \"can we have a free meal?\" He gave us a half apology and said that he understood we were paying a lot for the meal and that he would comp the meal. But Mr. Manager that wasn't the point of us wanting to talk with you, we wanted to explain our experience to you so you could help coach the server moving forward so she could learn from it. Yet, the manger kept speaking over us and interrupting us. We had a hard time understand him due to him speaking quickly and in a thick accent. We've never had this experience before and I believe the experience will be better next time but my advice to the owners is to coach management to listen to customers and take their concerns genuinely - not as an indictment against them.  My advice to customers who are considering Fish Market for a nice dinner in Ft. Mill is to definitely give them a try - they're wonderful but unless management makes positive changes they will not improve.",

I stayed on the lunch side of the buffet, my husband ate mostly breakfast items.  the she crab soup was very good, not the best I've ever had but it hit the spot. I did have to ask for extra sherry, it lacked that.  they had prime rib on the carving station (which is in the kitchen so you have to ask the server for it) It was GREAT!!!! they make it rare so you will need to have it cooked more if that is what you like. The aujus served with it was not broth like! It was thicker and stuck to the meat which was warm and very tender like all prime rib SHOULD be! i cut it with a butter knife!  I ate a bite or too of the fish, which was nice flavored but cold unfortunately. The shrimp and grits was for me blah! small seemingly previously frozen shrimp in course grits. The mac and cheese pasta was also blah, lacked cheese flavor and was again cold. The mixed salad on the bar was nice and there were several dressing choices. The desserts are a nice variety and small enough portions that you can get several! We will go back! but this time i know what to order!",

So for Valentine's Day, I decided to take my girl friend there for our 2nd annual V-Day date/birthday meal. I called ahead to confirm that it's still the same price (you know how places LOVE to hike the price on holidays) and made a reservation.  The place is smack in the middle of Baxter. Lovely looking white house, with parking behind the building as well as on street. By the time i arrived my friend already had a table right by the food stations (and we last minute added 2 more people).  Overall the food was plentiful. There was breakfast items (ex. omelet station, biscuit, gravy, grits, bacon, eggs, fried potato) and lunch items (fried chicken tenders, salad, salmon etc.) I have to say the \"shrimp & grits\" tasted good but lacking shrimps. The salmon was a bit overcooked, which is inevitably when served in a buffet. Prime rib (more like rib roast) was REALLY good, but we almost missed it because you have to ask the waiter to bring it from kitchen. Soup was good; butternut bisque was super creamy - I'm sure it's fat free - and gumbo wasn't an authentic gumbo but tasted good. Coffee was strong and good for $2. They even had a few small dessert items to choose from. The service was good, Big Mike took care of us. For the money I think it was a good value for brunch (hence 4-stars).",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to the Fish Market on a Saturday for our weekly date night. We arrived around 5:00 without reservations and were seated instantly. We asked to sit outside because the patio is well shaded. The patio is quaint with a lovely view of the fountain and Baxter Village. However, the patio does need some sprucing up. We noticed a old bird's nest on the porch light and debris on the ceilings and walls. As far as the service, our waitress was wonderful. She was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. She informed us the restaurant was offering a restaurant week special. Three menu items (appetizer, entree and dessert) for $35. My boyfriend chose the special and ordered the pork belly, filet mignon, and strawberry shortcake. I ordered the steamed mussels and a caesar salad. The meal began with fresh bread and a pesto oil mixture for dipping. It was delicious. Next came the steamed mussels and pork belly. Both were good. I really appreciated the portion size of the mussels. There were more than enough to share between us. Then came the caesar salad and filet mignon. The caesar salad was standard, but good. However the real disappointment was the filet mignon. The filet came with mashed potatoes and steamed kale. The filet was room temperature and chewy. It was topped with a watery gravy overpowered by a sherry sauce. The potatoes were also room temperature and topped with the gravy. The roasted kale was also disappointing as it was oversaturated with oil. My boyfriend braved his entree as he did not not want to ruin date night with a complaint. We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake, which was perfect to share. Overall, the Fish Market is average. The service and environment are great, but given the quality of food and prices, we do not recommend it. If you decide to go, stick to seafood.",

Our intention was to have a drink at the bar and then eat in the dining room, our bartender DJ was a delight, he was very informative about wine, spirits and beers and was very helpful on menu choices as he knew each and every item. Even though he was very busy he still managed to take good care of us so we decided to just eat our dinner at the bar as the restaurant filled up very fast. Food was outstanding, in particular the she crab soup was the best I have had anywhere, mussels were awesome and the calamari fries unbelivable. Entrees of sea bass, scallops and shrimp and grits unbelievable. Food and service from all staff members 5 star all the way.",

This is a fantastic restaurant and anyone complaining about prices must not have eaten at many high quality restaurants... seriously. In Charlotte, the prices would be at least $10 more a plate. We were given the \"chef's table\" which was really nice, though my only complaint was it was Halloween weekend and there was a \"pub crawl\" going on and it was close to the bar so it was a bit loud and not quite the ambiance we wanted for an anniversary, but my parents got a kick out of it and their 2 year old grand daughter loved to watch them. We had a few appetizers - the lobster mac was decent - 4 stars. The crab fritters were a HUGE hit - yum, coulda kept on eating those - 5 stars. Entrees I had the winner - the Chilean sea bass. Literally the best piece of fish I have ever had, and I'm a fish LOVER. Nice crisp crust, delicious butter texture... I die just thinking how good it was. Scallops were a hit with my sister-in-law. Brother loved the seafood cioppino. Mom loved her lobster. Dad loved his salmon. It was truly a wonderful dinner for a wonderful occasion. It would have been nice had the waitstaff remembered it was a 50th anniversary and at least sent a dessert, but we had dessert at home, so it's all good. Definitely going back.. LOVED it!",

    "text": "The Fish Market is incredibly overrated. While there are several good items on the menu (for example the She-Crab soup is excellent), the experience one receives is sorely lacking for the prices commanded. Severely impacting one's experience is the consistently bad service delivered at this restaurant. Last night provided a prime example of this as our entrees were delayed for some reason by over thirty minutes after the appetizers were served. This seemed odd as it wasn't very crowded at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. However, there wasn't any explanation or apology and about twenty minutes into the wait I asked our waiter if we could have some bread as this had been overlooked earlier at our table. When the meals finally arrived my lobster was served without any silverware or, more importantly, utensils to crack it open. When the waiter re-emerged five or so minutes later I asked if I could get these items in order to eat the lobster. By then the butter had cooled and, once again, no apologies or explanation as to why simple steps in the serving process were missing. Sadly, there wasn't a subsequent visit to our table from anyone to address the pitiful service. This solidified for me the fact the Fish Market suffers from poor management and isn't invested in (even average) customer service. I've been underwhelmed by this place in the past but this experience causes me to remove it from future consideration. Fortunately there are many other much better dining options in the area. Baxter Village would be well served if changes were made such that the Fish Market were staffed with competent and caring management as there is no indication any leadership exists.",

I don't want to trash this place because we did enjoy our meal, but the chef could kick up the spices a little.  We came here tonight because we didn't want to deal with Charlotte traffic to go to Brio, and this seemed convenient, but we regret that decision.

    "text": "The Fishmarket in Baxter is truly what it bills itself as...a unique restaurant in a unique atmosphere. The food has been great every time we've been. If you want a better seafood experience from a food standpoint, you'll need to get on your horse and head up to LaVecchia's in Uptown Charlotte...and even then, you may not do better. Probably need to go even farther, say, to Charleston, and check out Hank's before you'll find a rival any closer.   The Sunday brunch is also unbeatable. $2 mimosas and $3 bloody Marys are hard to beat, especially in Fort Mill, where several restaurants still lack the special Sunday liquor license...   Unfortunately, Sunday brunch is 100% of the business we do at this restaurant anymore...because we can serve ourselves. This is the first restaurant where I've taken off two stars for poor service, mainly because that is what precludes us from enjoying dinner here anymore. When I go to a restaurant that bills itself to be at this caliber, I've come to expect a couple of things from the wait staff...here are a few: 1) Be knowledgeable about the menu, when asked for a recommendation (I do NOT want to hear \"oh, I don't eat fish\" from a server at a seafood restaurant...go work at Applebees). 2) PLEASE come by my table more than once during a service...and that was just to drop off the bill, after one of her counterparts did the majority of the work. Wasn't sure who I was tipping? 3) Don't flirt with the bartender while you are on the clock, and I'm not being served. 4) Don't complain about how crappy your job is to other servers within earshot of customers, while those customers are waiting on you. 5) Do NOT, while I'm still sitting at the table, pick up the bill book once I've written my tip, open it while standing at the table to SEE what kind of tip I left, and then walk away without a word (don't know what he was upset about...it was a 20% tip....even WITH the crappy service!). 6) Don't be slower than Christmas, with EVERYTHING, and seem like it is an inconvenience to you when I ask for more water.   These examples are from multiple trips, and multiple different servers observed. Basically, a lack of server education/professionalism is evident at the restaurant. I wish I could rate it higher, because the food is definitely worthy. If the front of the house management does a better job hiring/training front of the house staff, we will return for more than just brunch.",

The place was extremely busy.  One would think that with as many people coming and going that the quality of food would have been better.  With the exception of the soups which were fantastic the food was \"marginal - horrible\" and warm at best.  When I mentioned that the food wasn't hot to the manager she snapped back that they were doing the best they could to honor local Mothers.  She then added that her own Mother was in the kitchen.  Normally this brunch cost $13.95 BUT in their attempt to \"honor\" local Mothers they raised the price to over $20 a person due to the holiday. We were extremely disappointed with the food and service thinking it was $13.95.  Imagine our horror to find out they charge more on holidays.  Oh yeah I should also mention that due to the holiday mimosa's were no longer $3 but regular price.  One fact was very clear - the only thing the Fish Market wanted to \"honor\" was their bank account.  If you love your Mom or Dad and want to honor them on their special day then skip this place.",

I got the scallops, and I can't speak highly enough about them.

The inside looks clean and formal (which I usually don't like this level of formal). Our server was Michael and he was extremely nice and attentive, and made great recommendations.   Brunch Pricey - but there are a decent amount of items here, and some pretty different and great like the salmon and shrimp grits (I don't like grits but these were great). They also had chicken tenders which was new to me for brunch but ok. They were great as well. The mashed potatoes were handmade, creamy and buttery. I regret not getting more. The breakfast potatoes were the best I've ever had. And they had bacon :). They also had soup (gumbo and she crab) and a bunch of other items like an omelette station, pasta salad, fruit, biscuits & gravy, etc. Oh, and prime rib which you need to ask for.   Surprisingly, the waffles and French toast were not good. They made a slew of it and it tasted old and hard. I was really surprised that this is where it fell flat. The waffles should be made fresh at the omelette station and be more of a centerpiece with some toppings to personalize like a strawberry glaze and whipped cream. Also I think it would've been great for there to be a ham carving station can the pieces they provide. The Mac and cheese was also not good at all. It wasn't cheesy, rather corkscrew noodles with grated cheese on top. For the price I would expect creamy Mac with a bread crumb topping. So for the price, I don't know if I'd come back for the brunch.   Fish sandwich - I'd come back for this. Golden crisp, and fried to perfection. I don't use that term often, but it was. The right shade and not greasy. The homemade tartar sauce was smoother than store bought which was great. Bun was soft and fresh. The fries are excellent. Really really great. Seasoned like Arby's. My wife had the crab cake lunch and the hush puppies she got...best ever. I really love 521's hush puppies, but these were amazing. Crispy on the outside. Warm and soft in the middle. I'm getting these next time. Great price and value.   Haven't had dinner here yet. Seems like more of a special occasion type of thing. I need to try their pork belly appetizer. I've also heard the sushi is good.",

Steak was cooked a little more than I wanted, but its steak so I ate it.  Everyone at our table was happy with their meal.  Several folks got she-crab soup and enjoyed it.  Lots of shrimp and grits orders.  Great atmosphere, staff, and quality of food was A+!",

    "text": "Anniversary dinner was amazing! We arrived early for our dinner reservation at the very same time the neighborhood Halloween pub crawl was entering the restaurant. The hostess immediately told us we would be seated away from the \"pub\" crowd for our dinner. Chris, our server greeted us at our table. His warm approach made you feel welcomed. He was very knowledgeable about the drink menu, wine selections and clearly his passion was the food this establishment serves. He walked us through the menu, made a few suggestions and supported the \"why\" on his suggestions. He then told us about the special for the evening ...tile fish, my favorite! I knew without any further review of the menu what I would be ordering and let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint. The fish was cooked to perfection, laid on a \"cake\" (stoneground grits or polenta, I'm not sure which, but it was delicious). The fish was surrounded by just the right accompaniment of open-roasted Brussel sprouts in a mushroom glaze. If manners did not precede, I think I would have licked the plate! The balance between fish, veggie and sauce was impeccable. I highly recommend ordering this if offered as a special again (perhaps a consideration to add this as a staple on the menu?). Hubby had decided before we arrived at the restaurant that he wanted crab cakes (this is one of their tried and True recipes), however, after Chris' description of a few other items, his decision was being swayed and he opted for the Carolina Stuffed Trout, which also did NOT disappoint. Chris did inform upon ordering that this fish is served skin-on, I know this can deter some, but hubby stayed with his choice. The presentation was very appealing (even with skin-on) and the butternut squash puree topped this plate off with the perfect seasonal touch. Hubby started his dinner with sushi made fresh and was told if there is any variation of preference in the way he liked his sushi, they are happy to accommodate. He chose the tuna and avocado roll, pretty basic, but they do it right, it was amazing and fresh. I, on the other hand, chose to try their she-crab soup. Suffice it to say, I was happy with my decision to get the bowl vs. the cup. Just the right amount of sherry to taste and not overpower. I was happy to discover the crab was \"lump\" and not \"slivers\" of crab from a can. All in all, we had a great experience from the time we walked in, to the time we left with our bellies full and our curiosity of this place highly satisfied. We will definitely be going back ... soon ... and will ask for Chris! 5 stars.",

My server was okay, wish she was more attentive and less timid.    The brunch is a buffet and I started off with an omelet which was the best thing I ate from the buffet and was so happy that a skillful chef was placed to prepare omelets.  I had orange juice which appeared to be a premium brand and I enjoyed.  I the biscuits were moist and warm the flavor would have been so much better.  I had scrambled eggs, bacon, salmon and ordered the prime rib well-done, both were okay but would have been great if served hot.  The cut fruit was sweet and juicy, just like you would expect.  I had a soup that tasted okay but was a bit gritty.  From the dessert bar I sampled the chocolate cake and cookies; the cake was good but the cookies needed help with the taste.  That is where the compliments end.    The french toast was cold and I requested a fresh order from the grill but was refused.  The waffles were dry and tasteless, other than throwing them out nothing could save them.  Several offerings on the buffet looked horrible and undistinguishable if a sign wasn't posted, so I did not bother to try them.  This pertained to the fried tenders with a sauce, sausage gravy, pasta salad, sliced glazed ham, mac and cheese, shrimp and grits and dessert bar.  I liked the buffet cost for what I ate.  However, since the majority of what I ate was cold from the hot buffet, I will not return.",

The waiter explained about the daily specials and the menu in general . Bread came to the table with a dipping olive oil mustard concoction .Both were very delicious . 2 of us ordered the specials such as the sword fish and scallop dinner.  My dining mates ordered the fried fish and Cioppino. 2 of us ordered the she crab soup and the jumbo shrimp cocktail . One dining mate ordered the wedge salad . The fish and seafood all tasted very fresh and tender. The soup was delicious. My friend said she had better wedge salads, her salad lacked crisper lettuce and blue cheese crumbles. Also her Cioppino had more chewy calamari than she preferred. We ordered a birthday cake for the table, a pound cake with fruit and raspberry sauce which was very tasty. Coffee was very good. All in all a very enjoyable dinner. Food was plated nicely, came out hot, good portions, menu pricey. Menu  has limited choices for  poultry, pasta and steak if one does not care for fish or seafood. The restaurant was quite crowded when we finished our dinner. We would certainly return. Wished I could rate 4.5 stars.",

Unfortunately we did not realize the popularity of the restaurant and had to wait at the bar for a bit before we could get a table. Service at the bar was a little difficult to get but we were able to finally flag down the bartender to try their scallop appetizer. The appetizer just has two scallops but they are a decent size and were cooked absolutely perfectly. When the dinner came we were impressed with how friendly and prompt the waitress was. I ordered the filet Oscar style which came cooked exactly as ordered and was delicious.   We had such a good experience with dinner that we went back for brunch, despite the fact that they don't open until 10:30 for brunch. Every year I get older I find it becomes increasingly difficult to wait to have such a late breakfast but Fish Market brunch was an experience worth waiting for.  The brunch is less than $14 for an all you can eat buffet. The buffet is more upscale than many of the other all you can eat options. The brunch includes an omelette station, French toast, salmon and shrimp and grits to name just a few of the items. I had to try a little bit of everything and my favorites were the shrimp and grits and the thin sliced but perfectly cooked bacon. We finished our brunch with a sampling of the decadent desserts scattered throughout the restaurant. The key lime pie is a must try!  I would highly recommend the Fish Market with the caution that reservations are a good idea if you want to eat during a popular time.",

    "text": "This review is strictly on the Brunch. After hearing a lot of great reviews on Fish Market my family and I decided to go one Sunday after church for brunch. I highly suggest making reservations as it seemed like there was somewhat of a lengthy wait. Luckily we had reservations but still had to wait about 5-10 minutes for our table.  Once we were seated, we were free to go to the brunch buffet line. The buffet seemed a little skim and needed to be refreshed with more food. There was a decent amount of breakfast foods and lunch foods on the buffet. There was also an omelet station where you could order a customized omelet. I went through the line twice in hopes to get a fresh batch of food and maybe try something else that was on the buffet as I was not impressed going through the line the first time. I got the last 2 waffle pieces that were left and a few fried honey mustard chicken nuggets, as well as some mac and cheese, sauteed veggies. There was not any more bacon or home fries at first but they were eventually refreshed.   There were a lot of dessert options such as cakes, cookies and pie. I did enjoy the chocolate chip cookies. But sadly that was about the only thing that I enjoyed during brunch.   The service from our waitress was excellent! She was very nice and attentive.   I will give Fish Market another try of dinner and update my review being that I have heard so many great reviews on this restaurant.",

Dirty and stained paper menus, server slow to clear plates as the meal progressed and just a general lack of attention matched the cold scallops and veggies that I ordered for my entree. The four scallops were also VERY small considering the $27 price. The $9.00 beet salad was also a huge disappointment. It was just a few beets with a bit of arugula and two very small pieces of blue cheese. It was heavily overdressed as well.   Underwhelming and overpriced.   With that said, it's a nice venue and can be better with just a few tweaks to food quality and service.",

    "text": "We went there for Sunday Brunch. It was a disappointment. I had such high expectations based on the reviews for the dinners they serve in the evenings. Sadly, we cannot say this has translated well into Sunday brunch cuisine or service.  For starters, do not make the mistake thinking this will be a seafood enriched brunch. It was not. They had some Salmon, Shrimp and Grits, and She Crab Soup. And that was all the seafood to be found. The rest of the brunch was standard breakfast food and none of it was the least bit impressive. In fact I was disappointed the grits were sub-par. And I love my grits.    And lastly, there  was a little bit of misinformation in the advertising of this brunch as it supposed to have a prime rib carving station. THAT is a gross over statement. One, you do not get to go to the station, you need to request this from the waiter. Which means you better know of its existence because no one is volunteering that information. Second, you are NOT getting a nice slice of meat. The serving is brought to you on a tea cup saucer! and its portion is maybe half of the saucer! and good luck getting a nice cut of meat. We didnt. we got chewy. I feel they should remove the mention of prime rib from the advertisement and its barely what you know as a prime rib carving station,  We gave it three stars because for the price, it was OK food. A regular brunch selection for the most part and none of the food was terrible. Hence \"3 stars, eh, OK\"",

I ended up ordering three appetizers. The wedge salad had little to no bacon or dressing, steak tips were luke warm and the shrimp and grits were ok.

Our meals have included: JUMBO LEMON-GARLIC SHRIMP Tempura Asparagus - Heirloom Potato and Crab Hash  FILET MIGNON Roasted Cremini Mushrooms - Potato Puree - Smoked Asparagus - Demi Glace - Hollandaise  SHRIMP & GRITS Tender, perfectly cooked shrimp in a Creole butter with tasso ham, Andouille sausage, and vegetables in a Cajun cream sauce over stone ground Parmesan grits  Deserts: One is better than the other--exceptional.

    "text": "I was quite impressed with my first visit here. It was recommended by a coworker as a place to take some customers for dinner after a day of duking it out. We were all pleasantly stuffed after.  We ordered rounds of drinks for the table which went from beers to wine to Basil Hayden bourbon. The waitresses seemed to know their stuff when it came to food and drink options. We ended up with five plates of appetizers including the spinach-crab fondue, baked oysters, charcuterie, calamari and pork belly. Every one of them was delish! Surprisingly, the seven of us saved room for our main courses. The restaurant has a rather extensive (and unexpected) sushi menu to accompany the main menu. I thought the main menu was more in line with what I expected from this kind of restaurant. Split about in half, some of us ordered sushi and others ordered main courses. Everyone loved their meals regardless of what they got.  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass simply because I don't often have the opportunity to eat this thick-grained, flavorful fish. They cooked it practically to perfection and laid it over a pile of mushroom risotto. Topping it off with diced pickled tomatoes evened the flavors out. I would come back here just for this dish time and time again. If you wanted to add to any entree you could order scallops, shrimp or crab plus any number of sides like asparagus or salad.  In case we weren't already full enough, the server brings out a giant tray of desserts for us to eyeball. By the way, this is one of the best techniques for getting people to order dessert. Put it right in front of them and they basically can't turn it down. There must be a study on how much more likely people are to buy a dessert like this. Enough to justify throwing away one of each at the end of the day? I stayed strong though another person at my table got a cobbler with ice cream that looked incredible.  The prices were a bit high, as expected, but totally in line with the quality of the food. I personally wouldn't come here for sushi. It seemed good but I liked the savory, cooked, \"American\" dishes so much and saw so many more I'd like to try. The restaurant was nice inside with a huge mural on the back wall and was dimly lit to keep the mood on course. Pun intended. Highly recommended!",

The interior of Fish Market looks lovely as well, though I can really only speak to the quality of outdoor seating which was quite nice. I would have liked it better if the ceiling fans had been stronger, but otherwise we were very comfortable.   Waitstaff are attentive and friendly. Prices are on the high side, especially given that portions are on the small side. However, the food is good and we received close to what we expected given the Baxter Village setting; you're paying a premium to eat in Baxter Village.  Pork Belly was perfect, calamari & beet salad both good, sushi was a bit on the small side and unfortunately nothing special.  Baked oysters were good, despite a heavy handed hollandaise sauce.   Our 2.5 yr. old definitely got a kick out of the colorful lime drizzle on the tasty cheesecake (see photos!).  Fish Market has an interesting menu and I'd be open to returning to try some of their other options. All in all we had a pleasant experience.",

I had the pecan brownie and he had the chocolate mousse for dessert. My brownie was huge but his chocolate mousse was only one tiny scoop. I thought was food quality was decent but the portions ranged from tiny to large. There needs to be better consistency with that. I'm not sure if I would go back for the regular menu.",

    "text": "We were around Baxter equipped with our Citipass coupon in tow with low expectations.  I generally have not had great experiences at most places around here that tout themselves as fish specialists, and the reviews were hit and miss. But at that point, my husband was at code red hunger which usually means he's mad at the world and nothing will satisfy.  Much to my relief, he ordered the shrimp & grits and I ordered a trout.  My trout had a ton of unique toppings like crab and apple and other good stuff that was really different and enjoyable. Trout can sometimes be a bit boring and the chef did a nice job trying to make up for it.  The accompaniments were well prepared.    But let's get to the shrimp & grits. Hungryman took a bite of his dish and I paused, waiting for his reaction.  He seemed to be savoring it and remarked, \"This is what I've been waiting for my whole life!\"  Touchdown!!! Exhale.  He really loved the sauce that it came with (a little more soupy than most around here) and had great flavor and he really enjoyed the sausage that came with it.    We were so impressed that we came back for Father's Day brunch where the S&G was available on the buffet. As you know, I HATE buffets, but it wasn't bad.  I might have even gotten my money's worth.  French toast, omelet station, cinnamon palmiers, etc...    The only reason I didn't give it a 5th star (because dinner deserved it) was the absolutely atrocious service we got in the brunch. The next table's waitress even felt sorry for us.  She was either new to the industry or just pissed off that she had to work in general. I had to get my own water after waiting 30 minutes. She even yelled at us for not being there one time while we were checking out the brunch line.  Also when we were there, it was $5 mimosas not $2 like Greg said. Maybe it was just for Father's Day.    Anyway we'll be back for dinner but probably not brunch. This place needs a bigger sign.",

Our server answered questions, made recommendations, was friendly and attentive without being in the way --everything you want when dining.    May I talk about the new chef?  I AM SO EXCITED about the new offerings, and the talk I hear about the new lunch menu. Where the fried (fish-camp-style) offerings ...which never made great sense to me at a place that serves exceptional seafood... is being replaced with more grilled items.   We took our (grown) son and his girlfriend for a birthday dinner this past week.  Oysters, check.  Almost thought I was back in New England, they were so fresh.  The boys ordered the She-Crab soup which is always good at Fish Market.  The girls ordered the tomato-basil bisque which I think was one of the most comforting, delicious soups (ok... bisuqes) I've ever had.    For entress -- my hubby had the mahi-mahi, which he usually gets, and it was grilled to perfection.  Son got the sea bass with the asian preparation that I've had and love.  Girlfriend got the salmon, which was so delicious, I ALMOST wished I'd ordered it. But instead -- I got the special, Grilled Sea Bass with strawberry salsa (OMGsh...amazing!!) served with basil-risotto (thought I was gonna die it was so delish) and grilled asparagus.  I am really thrilled with the dishes coming out of the kitchen with the new chef.  HOORAY!  My next question for mgmt at Fish Market  -- any cooking classes on the horizon?  Count me in.",

    "text": "I'm giving this 3 stars (5 star for the service.... 1 star for the food.)  It's like going to a place with excellent decor and super friendly wait staff, but mediocre cooking.... I live in the NE, so I benchmark against my home for good seafood.  After the disastrous scallop dish 2 days ago, I returned for a fish dish hoping to get better results.    Well, I was disappointed again.  First I had the Cioppini (wrong spelling probably).... I was told it's like a bouillabaisse but it turned out to be more like a large bowl of hot tomato puree straight out of the can with a few chucks of seafood boiled in it.... Absolutely tasted no seafood and I could not possibly eat the dish without ending up with Acid Reflux.  So I reluctantly sent it back -  my waitress insisted it was ok (she was really feeling bad for having recommended it).  Otherwise, I'd just eat what I could to fill up for the night.     For replacement,  I had the trout dish which came in several half fillet pieces dusted with cornflour and pan fired, topped with a few cubes of pears & bacon, on top of a pile of mash sweet potatoes and a pear puree (? unsure if it was pear).  First the presentation was 1st class, but taste was not.  I had better tasting trout elsewhere.  The bread this time was dry (not moist like the last time).    For the price of the entrees (mostly $20+), I expected better.  Also, other places would've included a salad ....well not here.     So will I come back again.... Probably Not.   I discovered Captain Steve's thru a local friend and the prices are cheap and you get nice piles of sweet scallops (broiled or fried) with a nice salad for below $20... the atmosphere is more like a family dining hall rather than a classy joint like Fish Market.  But hey I only care about good food.",

I ordered the smoked salmon croissant and it was really good: they did not skimp on the smoked salmon which I appreciated.   Bathroom wasn't the cleanest but it wasn't disgusting either.   I did not try dessert but my coworker did and it looked good. He seemed to love it.   I'd go back.",

    "text": "Ok, so I read the great reviews and decided to take my wife out for a nice meal ... I could have done better I guess, just not around here. First of all, I will say that we have seen this building for several years. I just never thought it was a restaurant. We actually, silly us, thought it was a Fish Market that sold you know, fresh fish. Imagine our surprise when we found it on Yelp. Oh well, after eating there, I guess it was not a big loss after all. Second of all, it is expensive. I am talking about Mortons of Chicago or Ruths Chris type of expensive. Our simple meal cost, with a tip, nearly 150 dollars. Maybe if we had stuck to tap water to drink, had no appetizers, no soup, and ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, we might could have gotten out for less, but hey, when we go out to celebrate, we want to enjoy ourselves. If the food had been great, and the atmosphere had been great, then there would have been no problem with the cost. But, the atmosphere was more like a Bob Evans, and kids were running around from table, the lights were as bright as at a Burger King, and it was as noisy as a McDonalds next to the plastic playground. Forth, the food was ok, but not great. It was comparable to a Longhorn steak house quality, with prices that are at least double, and an ambiance that is about equal. Not a great combination. We will not be back. Next time we have a special occasion, I guess we will drive to Charlotte, or Columbia so we can go to a decent restaurant. Too bad really, Fort Mill needs a decent restaurant, but alas, this is not it.",

The food is the best around the Fort Mill, Rock Hill area. If I want high quality seafood with beautifully prepared dishes and seasoned to perfection, this is where I would recommend. The shrimp and grits is the best entree on the menu! Please go and experience seafood and service at its greatest!",

Ate there a year ago at a decent size business function and food and service was good... Unfortunately last night wasn't the same.. Had 7:30PM reservations and had Steve, and I'd say it was \"average\" busy with a lot of open tables.... We wanted to sit outside and hostess told us to pick any table... We picked one and although it has been bused, it was still dirty..Told hostess and had to wait longer than it should have for her to come back to clean... after that we waited approximately 8 minutes for Steve to come over... Unfortunately Steve isn't in very good shape, and the 78 degree temp was clearly getting to him as he was sweating profusely...Steve told us about the wahoo fish special, but didn't know the price...waited for him to come back and ordered drinks and pork belly app.... Drinks took so long that the app. came out before the drinks.. My appetizer plate was chipped, and when the server delivered the pork belly, I told her and she took the plate - but never came back...When Steve finally delivered drinks, I told him, and he ended up getting me a plate.. Went to order dinner and asked him again on the price of the wahoo, and still didn't know (had to stop taking our order to check)... Empty appetizer dish and empty app. plates stayed on our table way too long...The main courses were delivered and they were still there...My wife ordered another drink, and Steve started to take her drink, which she hadn't finished. Wahoo came and the side dishes were hot, but the wahoo was not hot enough and needed to sent back to be heated up....Once heated up the meals were very flavorful.... my wife had the sea bass, which she loved.... We don't go out much, but when we do, I like to have good quality food and good service.... Hopefully ownership sees this note and reviews it with the staff (dishwasher, bus people, hostess, waitstaff, cook staff)",

I watched one of our plates get sent back repeatedly by our server (Nathan, who was awesome). Gah, and I don't want to know about the rag that he uses to clean the plates before they go out. I'm glad I don't have a food allergy because it's definitely the same one for every plate. And how do you run out of PASTA?! The lobster Mac was watery and please can we all agree to stop serving a Caesar salad as four whole hearts of romaine? Not a fan. Chef Sullivan you are a tool.",

    "text": "This is my second time at this restaurant. The first was for brunch, which was pretty good with the usual array of brunch options. This time a friend and I went for dinner. We had reservations for 5pm during Charlotte Restaurant week. When my friend arrived she didn't realize reservations were under my first name not last name. The hostess was quick to tell her that they were booked and couldn't accommodate her without reservations. Mind you there were MANY tables open, and MANY tables remained open the entire time we were there. Our server started off pretty good, making suggestions and was pretty attentive. He was however sweating profusely which was pretty gross. I'm talking completely wet shirt, wet face, wet hands \"profusely\" which made me certain he probably dropped sweat at some point into our food or drinks. The food was overall OK. The calamari fries and the roasted tomato? bread were great! The wedge salad was lackluster. Blue cheese dressing was watered down, not enough bacon and too many pecans. The Chilean sea bass was GREASY, bland flavor wise and a pretty small portion. The risotto, which I was charged $2 extra for switching to the crab risotto that came with the scallops was nothing to write home about. Not a piece of crab in sight; not sure why the need for an upcharge! My friend got the scallops which were sweet and cooked perfectly. Not sure why, but at the end of dinner our server kept making a big deal that he couldn't do anything for us since we were celebrating our birthdays. It's like we asked him for free dessert or something (we didn't!)  but he just kept making excuses, weird jokes, and apologizing. It was very awkward. Overall a very average seafood dinner experience. I would not be in a rush to go back.",

The staff is friendly and the atmostphere is decent. I peronally had the shrimp and grits and loved it but I can't say the same for the other meals I have had. Again, great for client meetings if you are in the area, but I would rather go farther into Charlotte if I can help it and especially so for non-work related dinners.",

Decor: Calm, cool, and comfortably upscale. Beautiful art, comfortable tables, and water elements.  This place is nice enough prom dates and wedding receptions, but is a comfortable enough for local families and groups to come and enjoy.  Service: Knowledgeable and friendly staff.
