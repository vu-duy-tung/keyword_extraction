It's clean I love how the decor matches the actual establishment and service that they're providing to the public there's always plenty of parking and even though it can be wait times ahead there never longer than 30 minutes. Go here you will not be sorry and I love their cherry cheesecake parfait!",

You can order your fish and take it home or have them cook it for you.  There is also a small menu you can order from and plenty of large picnic tables to sit.  I chose the fried shrimp Po Boy and my colleague had the Lowcountry Boil.  We both chose dirty rice as our side.  Mine was delicious.  The Po Boy sauce was awesome and the dirty rice was nice.  Not oily at all.  My colleagues boil was great too - 10 boiled shrimp with potatoes and corn.  Will definitely be coming back here!  Great find!",

    "text": "I'm so very excited about this place. Having come from New Orleans, I know what a po boy is supposed to be. And contrary to popular belief, it ain't just another name for a submarine sandwich. The bread has to be light and fluffy, with a very thin, almost brittle outside crust. Po Boy's has the staples: an array of fried fish, shrimp, even oysters or roast beef. The best part is that the fish is fresh and fried to order, you see the whole fish on ice in the front fish market area. I assume you can also just buy fish here to cook yourself, like any normal seafood market. I had the flounder po boy, cajun seasoned, dressed with lettuce, tomato and their cajun mayo remoulade sauce. It was hands down the best po boy I've had since I left Louisiana. I also had a lowcountry soup, with sausage, shrimp and corn and it was good. But the star of the show was the killer sandwich. I'm so happy to have found a place where I can order a real po boy. I'll be back, and probably pretty often.",

I've been back about 8xs. Everyone is/was very helpful and nice.  The prices are good/fair. I'm not really sure why the big difference in prices from a lot of different markets.  I'm just an average Joe so spending $$$ on a lb of tuna isn't gonna cut it. I just want to eat it, I don't want to sell it at my fufu  restaurant.

The oyster itself was fresh, but surrounded with a perfectly crisped, cajun-seasoned crust. These babies are clearly handled with love and thrown onto a well-made hoagie roll.  But if you're not into oysters, there are plenty of other options, such as the classic shrimp po boy. In addition to sandwiches, you can buy fresh seafood here by the pound (raw or cooked to order). Lastly, the people working here are so friendly! It encourages me to come back again soon.",

We had the low country boil, Fried shrimp poboy, Fried catfish po boy, side of Red beans (came with no rice), and  Side of fries. We got the Cajun seasonings on the seafood for the Poboy's. They were both very tasty but didn't have enough seafood like we're used to.  New Orleans boasts on OVERSTUFFED Poboy's and these definitely were NOT overstuffed or even plentifully stuffed for that matter.  The red beans were seasoned well but were definitely NOT New Orleans Red Beans & Rice and the fries were at least salted.  The low country boil was seasoned really good but I personally do not like andouille sausage which is the stereotypical sausage people associate with New Orleans cuisine.  It was wayyyyy better than Mr3crabpot in Charlotte!!!!!",

I will definitely be visiting again to try other items on their menu!!",

This low key fish market is the perfect stop for a sandwich to eat their or pick up some raw fish for home. Everything is out in cases for you to peruse when you walk in. Staff is friendly and helpful with recommendations and suggestions. You get a lot of fish in the sandwiches, more with fish than the shrimp poboy. Deliciously fried, fresh and tasty. The coleslaw was a great side and paired perfectly with our sandwiches. Make sure to ask for hot sauce!",

My fiance and I ordered a few different pieces of fish and some shrimp (cuz OPTIONS...lol) and split them. While she LOVED it...being a guy with Charleston roots, I felt there was a LITTLE missing on the complexity of flavor front. It was decent but I've had other spots in town really amp up the flavor when it comes to their options. The different seasoning options (which we made sure to diversify) ended up being not so different from one another which was a little disheartening. Ultimately, though, everything was decent,  just not earth shattering. That customer SERVICE, though, bar none! (And let me reiterate, my fiance LOVED it...so it could just be a personal taste thing for me...they're definitely worth the trip)",

The only thing that I can say is wrong is the pricing. It's all weighted and they charge your to  look them by weight. So it can get pricey if your hungry like I was.  I totally recommend this spot with every Seafood loving bone in my body. The food would be more enjoyable at home so get it to go.

    "text": "After a long morning of digging through the bins at the Goodwill Outlet my stomach was talking to me and seemed to be telling me that it couldn't wait the 15 minutes it would take to get home but that I would need to find a closer option. So I did what any respectable hungry person would do in that situation.....I opened up my Yelp! app and did a nearby restaurant search...Ooooh what is this?! A po'boy spot?! But where? and why had I never spotted it before ( I would later find out because it has only been open for 3 months). It was an off time of day, 4pm, so I rang em' up to check that they weren't just a lunch spot (yelp didn't have their hours listed). The friendly voice on the end of the line assured me that they were open until 8pm. Yessss.   Already having been hooked by eying a pic of the oyster po'boy I knew this was what I was getting. But the offer to \" You Buy We Fry\" for the various fresh fish was also a very tempting option for future visits. You get several options for the fry of the oyster. Cajun, S&P and regular I believe were the options. Then you can choose po'boy sauce or mayo as a sauce. I chose cajun and the po'boy sauce. Duh. The very enthusiastic girl behind the counter assured me that the combo I chose was also her favorite. I almost got one of the made-in-house sides, green beans perhaps, until I was informed that the sandwich was HUGE. Next time.  The size was indeed over ample, and the taste was on point. Perfectly seasoned fry on the oyster, not to mention a generous amount of the plump suckers, 8 If I am not mistaken. The bread was great as well, perfect balance of soft and chewy. It could have easily been split between two people, but not being one to cower away from a challenge, I finished the entire thing solo. However, not without regrets and the need for a nap.. zzzzzzzz",

The very sweet lady who took our order remembered us from our visit two months prior.  The food...OMG... I've ate a lot of fry house style seafood living in the South but their twist on it is so delicious.  The Po sauce on their poboys is da bomb! And their fried fish and shrimp is some of the best I've ever eaten.  Their okra is frozen but you'll mistake it for fresh.  Get the fruit punch then switch to Lemonade so you don't have to choose. Don't forget dessert.",

We've just placed our orders inside and taken it home or the few times we can get someone on the phone (no shade cause I know ya'll are busy) and taken it home but I will say the inside looks very nice and inviting.   So happy to see PoBoys on Freedom Drive. I live in the area and have tired of the other restaurants around. Can't see myself getting tired of good fresh fish tho. My only negative and to me it isn't a biggie (Ya'll can have all my five stars) is that I had a hard time finding if they were open on Sunday or not. Luckily I can just swing by on my way home and look at their sign.   Growing up my father would go to the outer banks and fish and bring it back to fry. This place reminds me of that. Nothing like good FRESH fish. And they season it to perfection. Please go here if you're a fish lover. Even if you don't live or venture to the west side much, make a special trip. It's worth it.",

They have a pretty good size display to show the fresh fish they have, like others have said you can have fish whole to take home or they will fry it there for you. I think they have like 4 different options for the seasoning. The Po boy is the star for this place with the Po boy sauce you cant lose. Dont sleep on just having them fry something else up also because it is Good! I was mad i didnt order more the first time. Yes its on the West side but dont let thay stop you from missing out on this place! I just wish i was closer to it because i will be making multiple trips back!",

The setup here is like a fish market, so you could actually go in and order fish, crab legs, etc to go. I ordered the flounder Po boy sandwich with fried oakra and lemonade.

When you enter the building (from the Freedom Drive side)  you go left by the seafood display cases and someone at the counter will take your order.  Menus are on top of cases.  You give them your name and they give you a ticket stub with a number.  You have a seat (usually in the chairs by the door).  When they call your name you go to the till and order your drink, if you want one, and pay.  Then you can have a seat at the table and they will bring your food to you.   The tables are picnic type and communal (other people may sit with you at your table if it is busy).  Enjoy you food and then bus your tray to the bins.  There is another door at the rear of the dining room to exit if you wish.  There is one co-ed bathroom.  It has a key pad and you enter the code to get in.  The person who is busing the tables can tell you the code.  The food is simple and good.  The vibe of the place reminds me of the old time North Carolina beach feel.  Easy going and relaxed.",

So you have a choice to getting your raw fish cooked or take home. They have the BEST Poboy's around. Their poboy sauce definitely reminds me like the one I tasted in New Orleans. They have a few TVs that you can watch while you eat. Nothing classy but cafeteria style seats and good food! Always get the salt and pepper shrimp po boy and the Cajun seasoned gator bites!",

Although, I am curious to see how all they prepare such beautiful seafood.  Get the shrimp poboy, have it breaded however you like.  Get some fries or fried okra and grab a tea while you're at it.  Thank me later.  That's it.  That's more than enough food for the first time trying this place.  The poboy is huge!  The shrimp are perfectly cooked, the bread was about exactly what I was looking for.  Spot on, one of Charlotte's best restaurants IMO.",

I heard so much about this place but being that it's a bit of a drive I never was in a hurry to go a friend invited me and I am so happy I went. I ordered 1/2 pound of catfish 1/2 fried shrimp fried okra with Mac and cheese. You can tell they are very popular and the amount of food given was so much. I knew as soon as my plate came I would need a to go box. My friend let me try his flounder and I will say that was my fav so far cooked to perfection. The only thing that disappointed me is the Mac and cheese. I am a huge fan of the dish and the one I tried here will not be ordered again. However, I will say that it didn't turn me away from the restaurant still my favorite seafood place in Charlotte so far and I will faithfully take that drive.",

The only thing missing is Maryland blue crabs. They have all kinds of fish, and seafood, and you can get it raw, steamed, broiled or fried with different seasonings. We had fried tilapia, whiting, perch, oysters, shrimp, scallops, and fries. OMG everything was so good cooked to perfection. The batter, the seasoning, so good. And dont forget to try their special homemade sauce. Be prepared to wait in line because the secret is out! The place was pretty clean when I was there. I do have 2 complaints the table we sat at needed to be wiped off and there is only one bathroom. We will be back! I will take some pics on my next visit.",

They give you a ticket stub and then find a seat. May need to share table when it gets busy. Chairs against the windows are for to go orders. They will call your name when your order is almost done. You go up and pay at the registers. The second time you hear your name called is to bring you food to the table. At that time you can ask for the condiments.  Finally a place you can get good Poboy's besides jakes good eats. What makes a good Poboy's? The bread!!! Nice and soft, but not heavy. Just strong enough vessel for the fried seafood.  We had the oysters and soft crab Poboy's. Choose between regular, salt and peppers, or Cajun batter.  Most people order the fried fish when I looked around   Sides: we had the sweet potato okay, hush puppies , and cracklings (fried pork skin) we had Cajun seasonings.   Will try fried okra and country boiled next time.    Definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place after reading all the amazing reviews. Freedom Drive is kind of lacking when it comes to really good restaurants. Anyway, this place is right next to the Community Thrift Store and there appeared to be plenty of parking. I snagged a spot right at the front during lunch time so that was a plus. Inside there's a counter where you can order various kinds of seafood either raw or cooked (priced by weight), and they also have a menu of sandwiches, salads, soups and sides. To the right is a dining area with a nautical theme. The guy (medium height, sandy blond-ish with a beard) who helped me was really patient in explaining all the options, which I appreciated. He was the bright spot in this whole thing. I ordered a shrimp po boy with Poboy sauce, which he said he would put on the side, and BBQ pork cracklins. When the young woman (short, with short hair) brought out my food, she asked if I wanted sauce. I was confused because I wasn't sure what else needed sauce that I'd ordered. She said since I ordered a poboy, it already came with sauce. Cool. I don't need extra. I'll say that she didn't really have an attitude, but she wasn't as pleasant as the guy who took my ordered. She just seemed bothered that I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted (or needed) extra sauce.   ...of course I get home and there's NO sauce on the sandwich (like the guy and I agreed) but there's also NO sauce on the side. Just dry. It's annoying because someone else mentioned getting home and having a dry sandwich- I should've checked the bag before I left. Oh well.   The sandwich itself was fine, the shrimp was crispy and seasoned well. Sure would've been nice to have some kind of sauce on it. The cracklins were salty and I just didn't feel great about eating them. I'll give them one more shot before making a final decision, but for now it's three stars.",

Seriously though, this place is on point in all respects.  Prices, friendliness and most importantly, good food.  Now, I'm only going on this one visit personally but all these other 5 stars can't be wrong.  Beyond the good quality fried shrimp on the Po Boy they got the bread right.  Little crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  I went kind of traditional with mayo but there is their Po Boy sauce along with ketchup, tartar and hot sauces available and i pretty much tried it all.  It was a beautiful day and I sat outside and in about 7 minutes, out came a guy with a tray of goodness.  I had the fries (crinkle cut) and slaw as sides and both were decent companions but the star was the sandwich.  They've got a seafood market too where the product looked fresh and the prices seemed reasonable.  They'll cook selections for you or pack it to go so you can do it up at home.  Po Boy's isn't in the neighborhood for me but it's a guarantee I'll find reasons to come back!",

I chose the light salt and pepper seasoning for both and it's just right. I'll have more than enough to take home for dinner. I'm mad that it too this long for me to come. The food is fresh and they prepare it for you if you want. They have seating for dine in or you can get it to go. This swai is amazing! Flavorful without being fishy. I chose Mac and cheese and green beans for my sides and birth are decent. The green beans are salty so if you're trying to cut down on your salt intake don't get these. Highly recommend when you need really good seafood cooked to perfection",

I got the Canadian perch, five fried oysters with the Cajun seasoning, and three large shrimp  Cajun. Red beans, fries  and Mac & Cheese.  The red beans are always good and the crinkle fries are really great.  However, I have to say today the mac & cheese was really terrible, I even had them put some Cajun seasoning on it to give it more flavor. But it tasted like Mac with no cheese and slightly sour milk! But the customer service in this place is amazing for a counter operated service.  Immediately when I told her about the Mac, they asked me what I wanted instead, and made me a fresh batch of hush puppies.   Just a few days ago I tried another seafood market that cooks and prepares the food for you closer to the southside Of Charlotte.  The customer service from the owner was an atrocious, and the food was just OK.  If you've never been to this place you've got to try it! We will definitely be coming back for more great seafood, and Fish.",

The sandwich comes with a po boy sauce which is mayo based with a kick. Overall the sandwich was great!  If you're looking for fresh seafood this is the place to come. Not only is it this place a market, but they will also cook what you choose. I'll will definitely be returning to this spot!",

My husband got the catfish poboy (Cajun breading) with poboy sauce. He also was excited to see Cracklin on the menu and ordered a small size of them with bbq seasoning.   Wanting to try different things, we split our Poboys so we could sample both. We agreed that both were fresh and super tasty. I would have liked a little more poboy sauce but it was otherwise, perfect. I liked the shrimp best and my husband liked the catfish best.   My husband was a bit disappointed that was was called cracklin on the menu is actually pork rinds. He liked it (although his wished it had more bbq seasoning) and said he would get it again but prefers actual cracklin and had his hopes up.   Overall- tasty and reasonably priced. We are fans!",

    "text": "At first glance, it might not seem like you have arrived at the right place - I mean it looks like somewhere you can grab dinner (and the kind you eat then and there, or at least take out not the sort you have to make yourself). In fact, it looks like an old fast food joint. Surely they have something to eat. But it says market. And when you walk in, they have a bunch of what appears to be fresh fish, and nothing on the menu that would seem like you can order it to eat.  So... What gives? Just wander up like you have no clue and they'll be happy to help. This is the approach I took and it works wonders.  The staff here is amazing - some of the friendliest and most helpful ever, and patient like you would not imagine (incidentally, they do have menus where you can order po boy sandwiches, they are just usually sitting on the cases containing the fish). Those staff will help you through the menu, or they will help you with something to go.  Then the will give you your number, and bring the food out to you when ready, and be ready - it is a heck of serving. Sandwiches are not small. Sides are perhaps a bit on the small side, but you didn't come here for the sides, you came for the po boys - that's what is on the sign, after all. The one you should definitely try is the cracklins - much better than the kind you'll get in a bag at the store, and with some cajun spice on them, well worth it and they go great with the sandwich.",

Have had the coleslaw which is also great - it's chopped/diced versus a stringy-er version. The atmosphere is relaxed - they have picnic style tables where everyone just sits together - people are super friendly & have never had an issue sitting with anyone. The staff is great - friendly, attentive. I recommend the po boy sauce - we have it on the hush puppies. You won't regret trying this place & once ya try it, you'll be a regular too!",

Choose your fish/seafood, say how much you want (4 shrimp, a couple of oysters, some scallops...or maybe fried catfish?) and then choose a couple of sides.  Sit down and get ready for your feast.

I got extra sauce. They also sell raw seafood here which I can take home and cook. But they good think about this place is it doesn't smell fishy. Its nice and clean, the waiters are attentive and they had steady customers coming in. I would say give it a try. I want to try the different poboys, so I will be back.",

So, we were kinda pressed for time as our flight back to OKC was pretty soon, but wanted one last Low Country Seafood treat before we left the Carolina's.  And let me tell you...PLCSM did not disappoint! It was our first time going to a seafood market where you can pick out your fresh seafood and have them cook it to order while you wait.  Of course you know what my wife ordered!...yes., shrimp and fries. But, I got the oyster po' boy...sooo good!, sooo fresh!, sooo tasty!!!(I did add a couple of her fried shrimp to my po' boy, sooo right!)  After our meal we hurried out to get to the airport for our flight, both of us commenting, that if we missed our flight...it was sooo worth it!",

I drove all the way across Charlotte to see if it was as good as I heard it was.   I walked in starving after my workout w/a confused look on my face. Dino immediately welcomed me & asked if this was my first visit. I told him I was recommended, but I wasn't sure what was good... He said everything is good (I've heard that before). He explained the items I asked about. I decided to go w/the shrimp, mac & cheese, & yams. Dino weighed my fresh shrimp, asked how I wanted them seasoned, what sauce I wanted & he made it happen.   The food & service exceeded my expectations! The seafood was so fresh, the sides were as well & they were cooked to perfection. The atmosphere was nice, the theme of the decor was perfect & all of the employees were so friendly & knowledgeable. I can honestly say, I was not expecting the level of service & experience I received. I received a customer service experience comparable to some of Downtown's 5 Star establishments from the time I walked in the door. The employees work so well together as a team & it's such a welcoming atmosphere. It's a very clean friendly establishment (even the bathroom).   The food was so good, that I placed a to go order for later & told all of my friends about the new Queen City gem that I found today : ). Po Boy's is some of the best fresh seafood I've had in Charlotte (top 2).  If you're a foodie & you enjoy delicious fresh seafood & amazing customer service, stop by Po Boy's & treat yourself to the experience you deserve!   Thanks for a great 1st experience. I'll be back (this week)! ; )",

A coworker and I went to Poboy's around 4:00 pm (late lunch) so there was not a crowd. When we went in we explained we were first timers which prompted the staff to explain what is offered and served. Be prepared to see fresh seafood when you walk in. It feels like a seafood market...and it is as well as a restaurant. You select what you want and they prepare it for you! Did I say the food was amazing?!!! They have selections from oyster, several types of fresh fish, including flounder, croaker, all the way to jumbo shrimp and alligator! We selected the flounder Poboy sandwich. It was very flavorful. We also had shrimp and oysters! You can choose flavors to have your food prepared in salt n pepper and Cajun. The sides were also good; fried okra, macaroni ( not a lot of cheese but good flavor, and pinto beans( rated as okay). I will definitely be back to visit!",

I also am not a big fan of mayo, tater or creamy sauce like the Poboy's sauce and the sandwich was actually really good with out any sauce.   For my order today I got one fried Cajun Shrimp Poboy, plain pork skins and some fresh catfish fillets.  I got the sandwich and my mom ordered the other items. She devoured half of my sandwich. I wish I could have eaten more of the ting golden pieces of shrimp. My mom liked her items and even stated that the prices for the fresh fish is cheaper that a place down the road.

    "text": "You know you're southern when this no frills comfort food place is a completely acceptable after church/funeral/etc. meal. Stopped in here with family to split a pound of flounder and a pound of shrimp. A no frills place this establishment is both a market (buy seafood raw by the lbs and take it home) and a restaurant (buy it by the lbs and ask them to boil, fry, etc.) and eat it in house or take it home.   We ordered the flounder fillets, 26/30 shrimp, and some hushpuppies (completely forgot  they did fried okra or I would have been all over that). Anyway, the flounder was thick and flavorful fried to perfection and the shrimp honest were the sweetest shrimp I have had in a long time. I literally cannot sing the praises of this place loud enough.  The comfort food this place offers and the unpretentious ambiance just kind of warms you soul. Seating is limited in the form of picnic tables inside and outside. I absolutely love how southern this joint is; if someone is sitting at one end of the table don't be afraid to ask to sit at the other and take sometime making a new friend. Felt like I was at a family fish fry talking to so many people like we knew each other.",

    "text": "I am in love. Like seriously in love! Moving from a small town to Charlotte, I've been on the search for my new \"go to\" spots for my favorite foods. Japanese and a Fresh Seafood Market being at the top of the list! With Poboys I got a Fresh Seafood Market AND Fresh Cooked Seafood in one stop!! I'll admit, I was skeptic going in because of past experiences for 2 reasons. One being I don't want to eat in a place that smells like raw, expired fish. The 2nd being I didn't want my seafood to have that \"fishy\" taste. You know as if they just pulled it straight from the ocean, didn't rinse it & just put it in the fryer? Yeah, I didn't want that.  So I walked in and all I was hit with was the aroma of seasoned fresh seafood. Nice! Then I was confused. Is there a menu? Do you order the cooked seafood in a specific area or both at the same time? I didn't know where to go or what to do. When it was my turn I walked up and asked for direction on how to order and for a menu. She was very patient as she explained everything to me. They have a small menu where you order PoBoys and a few other small items, however, if you want other fresh cooked seafood you simply pick it out and tell them how you want it cooked! Your price is based on what you get and how much it weighs. Do you want 10 shrimp? They'll cook 10 shrimp! I was excited. They let me taste the soup of the day and the slaw and then I placed my order. You can have your seafood cooked Regular Salt & Pepper, Cajun or Lemon Pepper.   I just went regular and ordered a piece of Croaker & Flounder, a pound of Large Shrimp, a cup of the Seafood Gumbo, Slaw & Fries, all fried hard! They hand you a ticket and you take a seat until your name is called to pay. While you pay you are asked if you'd like a drink and any sauces. Then you take a seat until they call your name again for your food. To preserve the crispiness of my seafood I always poke large holes in the top of the container, however, it would be nice if they let it rest for a moment before throwing it into the container. I would be willing to wait the extra time to avoid soggy seafood.   But the food was delicious!! perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried & fresh!!! I did a happy dance as I ate. I love their slaw, and I don't usually like restaurant slaw. The only thing that was not so great were the fries. They were thin crinkle cut fries that didn't have that great a taste. I wasn't a big fan of the croaker, but only because i'm country where all we cook our croaker in is cornmeal and not seafood breading. So I returned another time and order uncooked croaker to take home. What I noticed on this visit was that the prices were steep! I guess that's the price you pay for Charlotte? I snatched up 4 Croaker. All of their selection was very large. I miss my old seafood market where I was able to grab a container and tongs and pick out my own fish where they had various sizes. So I may still search around Charlotte for something similar to that. But overall PoBoys is a WIN!",

    "text": "I found this restaurant on Yelp's suggestion after cruising down Freedom drive for a food truck. When I realized that I mixed up the trucks schedule and hadn't ate anything since the day before, I was ready for anything considered edible or better. To my surprise, Po Boy's was so much more than what I was ready to accept when I was at the brink of culinary defeat. Cheap, simple, and delicious!  When you first walk in, you're immersed in somewhat of a full on seafood market. To be honest it's a little unclear as to where you're supposed to place your order if you're there just for lunch or dinner. For what I gather you can place your order at the seafood counter or at the register near the dining room. At the very least, they didn't tell me otherwise so that's what I did. I got the shrimp Po Boy seasoned Cajun style and a spicy remoulade sauce. I also got a Mac n' Cheese on the side. After paying and having a seat in the small waiting area, I got my food in about 7 minutes.  Considering I was famished and feeling rather grouchy, I opted to eat in my car. I did notice that the dining area was very clean and tables were being tended to regularly so I wouldn't hesitate to dine in next time. The Po Boy was de-lish. Hoagie had a rich flavor without back-seating any of the shrimp, which were breaded and cooked perfectly. I loved the Cajun seasoning which emphasized flavor over spicy. The remoulade sauce provided a contrasting creaminess that played nicely with the very fresh tomatoes. Nothing poor about this Po Boy at all. Low-key perhaps, but aggressively superior to any other Po Boy I've had in Charlotte.  Mac n' Cheese was pretty good. It definitely wasn't as complex as the Po Boy and that's okay. Creamy, cheese, and al dente pasta that was seasoned well. For the price, this is a steal!  I'm so blown back by this unassuming joint. Get yourself one of these magical Po Boys soon!",

There is more to order than appears on the menu, any of the fish on display can be fried or grilled and sold by weight. As delicious as each of the fish and fried seasoning are (Cajun, salt & pepper, and regular), I knew the side items wouldn't let me down. But my soul was not prepared for the SIDE OF YAMS! PHENOMENAL! If you don't know what to get and you want to try it all- order the Cajun po boy, Arnold Palmer tea, side of okra and get the yams as dessert. It will not disappoint.",

What ever you order will be delicious from the catfish all the way to the softshell crab you can't go wrong. I usually get it Cajun style with the PoBoys sauce they say it is spicy but I can barely notice the heat, if you're nervous about the spicy you can order it plain w/ mayo eithier way you can't go wrong.   Now as far as the fish market part Im usually really mad at myself when I come here and I forget to bring a lunch bag with an ice pack. The fish here is always fresh like eyeballs are not cloudy and fresh off the boat! And let me tell you the fish has to sell out all the time because of the amount of people coming in and out just blows my mind.   Definitely worth a trip for a bangin PoBoy or some fresh fish here in the queen city.",

I love the concept of placing an order for fresh seafood and having it cooked while you wait.  Had this same experience in Denver, CO and was so glad to see something like this come to our area.  The seafood is displayed and labeled appropriately, prices are fair, clean and no fishy smell---which confirms the freshness of the supply.  Great job to all.  Thanks for a wonderful experience; I will definitely be back.  Keep up the good work!  Ray",

Don't be fooled by the seemingly limited menu, they can and will cook anything you want.  If they have it in the market, they will cook it for you any way you like.  My wife got 1/4 pound small shrimp fried Cajun style, and really enjoyed it.  The breading was the perfect consistency, not to thick.  I got the low country boil small plate and everything was delicious.  It comes with 10 shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage.  The seasoning was strong without taking over the dish.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  We just moved to the West side and will be making this a regular stop.",

I got mines with Po boy sauce which is a must have but they didn't put enough on the sandwich so I'm glad they had bottles that you can take to your table but if you order to go you might want to get some extra if you don't want a dry sandwich. I had the sandwich small fries and bottled water for under $11.",

Their breading was really good - that is saying something. The seafood market part with the fresh fish looks like really good quality. We didn't get any fresh fish - but it looked appealing and there was no strong fish smell which was refreshing. Their staff was very helpful - the young man who took our order noticed we were newbies and gave us a quick intro. Their system was down and unable to take credit cards (after a bad storm, their system was affected) but they were helpful to mention it before they took our order. I can't wait to take my husband back in the near future! Thanks for a great experience.",

Ordering and paying is done at the counter, but cooked meals are delivered to your table and tables are bussed regularly.

I can't believe we were afraid to walk in here lol I was completely blown away when I found such a fresh fish market so close to home!!! You can purchase whole or have it gutted and even fried! They have regular seasoning or Cajun seasoning. Everything also looked very fresh with clean containers and ice everywhere, they take their precautions. I'll be picking up fish fillets from here moving forward.   As for the food, also wonderful! I ordered the fried shrimp Poboy while the bf had the fried chicken poboy. We also got a small side of okra to split and a small banana pudding. We were having a movie marathon and really didn't want to leave so we stocked up. And stocked up indeed as the portion sizes here are insanely big. The Poboys are served on a hearty 9\" hoagie roll while the \"small\" fried okra side we got was enough for 3 people. We were very stuffed before even opening the okra. First off, I love the Cajun seasoning for your fried items! Everything was freshly fried without excess oil or grease, nice! The sandwiches were packed with our protein of choice with lettuce and tomatoes. The okra... Has got to be the best fried okra I've ever had hands down!!! Like shut the front door good! So fresh on the inside, I'm guessing they do not use frozen okra, and perfectly crispy on the outside. The banana pudding was very good as well, apparently they bring in desserts from local bakeries.   The staff was wonderful, she took time with us and explained everything since we were noobs. Great people. My recommendations: Make the Po sauce a little spicier, had to add siracha, and invest in steam/heat friendly takeout containers. The styrofoam will melt! Fan them open in the car ride home so you don't eat plastic! Regardless, we will for sure be back for more! Yay for PoBoy's Low Country!",

I have been here several times and service is consistently friendly. There's no place like this near me so I have to drive 15 miles to get my fix.",

If I could say anything it would be about the charge for cooking the food. Back home they charge $1 per pound and here they charge $2, but ultimately I guess it is what it is. The food taste great so that takes the sting out a bit for the pricing. I guess I'm just spoiled and have to get used to the prices here. I've been here more than once and definitely recommend you give them a try.",

Once we arrived plenty of parking, restaurant very busy, everyone smiling and happy. We were immediately ask if our order could be taken. After a few minutes of looking over the menu and by the way everything sounded good. They have all types of seafood you could possibly want (of course it's all fried). They also have fresh raw seafood that you can buy by the pound or by the case, we decided on the Po boy shrimp sandwich & the Po boy flounder sandwich. Can I say the shrimp Po boy was amazing! The shrimp was fried to a perfect crisp, it was just spicy enough, not too spicy just the way I like it! The sauce that comes on the sandwich was that extra that made you stop and appreciate all of the wonderfulness in your mouth. I was a little disappointed there were no broiled or steamed options on the menu. Did I mention orders are made fresh. No food setting under heat lamps!! if you're looking for the best fried seafood in Charlotte, definitely hands down Po Boys on Freedom Dr.  is your place. Check them out!",

I placed what I thought was a fairly large to-go order today, and when I arrived for pick up I had to ask the cashier if the total was correct as it was such a good deal. I have not yet ordered any fresh seafood from the market to take home and prepare but plan on doing so soon. The restaurant is clean and tidy and doesn't have an overwhelming fishy smell at all. I've only known about Poboy's for one week and have already visited four times if that's any indication of how good it is. As a recommendation you cannot go wrong with any of the fish fried Cajun style, a side of fried okra, and hushpuppies.",

I ended up going for the fried shrimp po'boy and a side of cracklings. The sauce on the po'boy was delicious. (I'm partial to mayo-based sauces anyway.) The fried shrimp weren't greasy at all, and the breading was light and flavorful -- really just perfect. The bread was great, too. Very soft with a crispy crust.  If I lived in the area, I would LOVE to buy fresh seafood from them, too. I feel spoiled with seafood up here in Boston, but the South definitely has seafood worthy enough to be on par with what we have up hear!  Do stop by this place if you're looking for a tasty Southern seafood meal and pleasant staff to boot!",
