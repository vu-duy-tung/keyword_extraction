    "text": "We had dinner here last night. It's the second time we've eaten here. The first experience was OK, but nothing particularly noteworthy. So, I wanted to make another visit before reviewing. Last night's dinner was very good... Not quite a 5, but close.  For apps, our party shared onion rings, the stuffed jalapenos, and edamame. The onion rings were so crispy and not a bit greasy, but needed a bit of salt and pepper. The ranch dressing on the side was really creamy. The stuffed jalapenos are really good. They're not breaded and fried, so they have a much fresher flavor. The only downside is the portion is too small. The edamame was fine, but again a small portion.  For my meal, I had pulled pork, black eyed pea salad, and jalapeno grits. All were excellent. The pork was moist and flavorful. The grits were creamy, bordering on decadent. And the black eyed pea salad was so fresh and the peas had just the right amount of bite to them. Everyone else in my party of 7 really enjoyed their meals, too.   The prices are on the high side for the amount of food you get. If you are looking for Southern BBQ that's good but cheap, this isn't the place. That's because the atmosphere is much nicer than a BBQ joint. This place is a bit more refined, with appetizers, a full bar, and no rednecks. Overall the food is good and we'll definitely be back.",

I ordered the Orange and Blueberry smash and it was worth the price. They are generous on their whiskey pour and you won't need to order another one. One of the girls that was with us is vegetarian and the other gave up meat for Lent. Neither one of them had a hard time finding something on the menu. One friend ordered the salmon tacos and I immediately had regrets about my order. Delicious and you should definitely order them! I ordered the southwest salad and added chicken. It was not my favorite and wish I had went with the brisket with a side. I can't wait to go back and actually order some of their BBQ.  I think the server was having a bad day because our service was pretty terrible.  I think she even forgot about us when we asked for our check. I'll definitely give this place another try. Loved their background music...a lot of 90's grunge which is a WIN in my book!",

Props to the house BBQ sauce and collards. That said, I don't feel compelled to return. If I was in Cotswold already and hungry, sure.

I liked the andouille sausage quite a bit, although I would have been happier with a bit more heat. The brisket was much fattier than I prefer. I realize that this is largely personal preference, but I dislike fatty cuts (and a lot of BBQ places will ask you how you want your brisket). Plus, it was $4 more to add to the platter. Sweet potato fries were kinda flavorless. I did like the slaw. The improper nachos were good, but there was definitely not enough cheese for the amount of chips.   I think that the price of this place didn't match the quality. I strongly prefer Midwood Barbecue. I'd be willing to come back in person and see if the food is better when dining in, but it won't be a priority.",

    "text": "The Improper Pig, not sure where to begin. I was so wishing to like it more than I did, but overall just thought it was okay. My dinner group met here on a weekend and were seated on the outdoor, covered patio on cooler nights.  Although it was nice to sit outside service was very slow, as our waitress seemed to be no where to be found several times throughout the evening.  Having not been I was able to enjoy some appetizers that we ordered for the table. The chorizo stuffed jalapenos were by far the best thing I ate the whole night. They were cooked too perfection with a great, but not so hot, kick. The cornbread on the other hand was dry and I definitely had better. And, I am not a kale chip fan, but they needed more salt or seasoning, definitely just blah.  I went ahead and ordered the combo platter with pulled chicken and brisket, with Brussels Sprouts and Sweet Potato Fries. The pulled chicken was just okay, not as moist as I have had or liked and the brisket was good, definitely melt in your mouth moist, but just a lot of fat. As for the sides, I definitely recommend the Sweet Potato Fries, so good!   The Improper Pig offers a variety of sauces tableside, so you can pick and choose. Unfortunately I found most of them a little too sweet and missed a True barbeque sauce.  Overall, I am glad I finally made it to this quaint addition to the Cotswold Shopping Center, but with too many other barbeque joints, that I find better, not sure I would rush back anytime soon.",

But if you're a spice lover like me, when you get the nachos ask them to add that spicy barbecue sauce to the nachos... this sauce kicks this up to the next level! They were SLAMMING!!! Must try!!

I had the Costwold platter with pulled pork and chicken with baked beans and coleslaw. My bf had the full rack of ribs with baked beans, everything was delicious. The chicken and pork were juicy and those beans were awesome! The ribs were tender but a little dry for his liking(they were ok to me) our waitress was very knowledgeable about the bbq sauces and the Smokey sauce was the right one for us. Although we didn't dine in our food was still hot and fresh when we got home. I will visit again probably on a Monday when my 9yr old can eat for 99 cents when you dine in.",

I must say the first time I had arrived the smells coming out of the restaurant were inviting, kind of like a fresh cooked pig from the local smoke house, and the service was terrific. I had a the pleasure of being served by Haley, and had a very wonderful experience. She was kind, proper, and very friendly. Hoping to the third time I had visited the Improper Pig I was served again by the wonderful Haley. She really puts you at ease and makes the whole experience at the Improper Pig lovely. The food was impeccable. It was cooked by the main man Speedy leaving every bite making you want more. I must say you cannot go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. Everything was cooked perfect, nothing was over cooked or under cooked. A definite recommend.",

We sat in the bar area and right in front of Vincent who was prepping the pulled pork and on the grill.  They have a Bloody Mary Bar which was a lot of fun creating your own drink. Sprinkled with Crispy Bacon...  Cornbread Muffins- Cute bite size with a packed punch (Jalapeno). That is what stood out and the black-eyed peas on the side.  We both ordered the Sliced Beef Brisket & House Slaw with Chips. Brisket was so tasty and juicy that I tackled the brisket and left the buns. Thinly slice potato chip and playing with all the 6 different sauces. The Spicy Green Beans- must order so crunchy and fresh.  Relaxing Sunday brunch/lunch here. Will be back again for sure.  Our waitress was Autumn, informed us to sign up with SteelZ app on mobile phone and get a Free Southern Egg Roll-The filling very unique with sweet potato and collard greens.   Would have not known about this restaurant if it were not for a Yelp event that I attended in the past.",

The cornbread was amazing! It had this kind subtle spice to it that would go perfect with any food that you could eat. The main course with its seasonings and was flavored to perfection. I also scored a free egg roll which was filled with sweet potato hash and collard greens wrapped in an egg roll coating. Delicious. Our server was very sweet and attentive with us. Answered all of our questions as this was my first time visiting the restaurant. Also, the Coca Cola, which is my favorite soda, was the perfect consistency of carbonation to syrup. Best coke I've tasted from a restaurant fountain in a very long time. If you get a chance to try something new and are in the mood for something amazing, try The Improper Pig.",

The bartender taking orders was rude , unprofessional, didn't even bother to go over menu items with me she just rang up my food and never said a word. Not sure if she was having a bad day or not but she was very rude. After walking around and leaving me at the bar for 20 with not a drop of water nor was I offered a drink or anything. But the guy eating watching basketball with his son got all the service. ( guess I should have eaten in instead of takeout). The food was great!! the green beans excellent!!

Both were good. Egg rolls needed seasoning with sauce from table though. Had beef brisket (more $) with roasted brussel sprouts and jalapeno cheese grits - all very tasty. Good variety of sauces on table to choose from. Only negative: water tasted metallic.  Second visit: Sunday lunch with three adults and one toddler. Food good again, crowded again and good service again. Collards - wonderful. Brisket on one meal was fatty. Not the case on previous visit. For $4 more - it should be perfect. Bloody Mary bar looked intriguing. Didn't try it though. Kids mac n cheese - creamy but not terribly cheesy looking. Sweet potato fries were good. Brought in our own applesauce & kids' drink.",

I chalked this up to typical opening week jitters and didn't really get upset. Once the food came, it was pretty good although my friend wasn't as impressed. Flash ahead 6 months and I decided to go by myself for a later than usual lunch. This time I ordered the brussel sprouts with my BBQ and I was in food heaven! They do charge you a little extra for the brussel sprouts but they are totally worth it. To be honest, the BBQ is good but nothing special I couldn't get at other area BBQ joints. But I couldn't get those brussel sprouts out of my mind so I brought my same friend back a few weeks later. This time the brussel sprouts were kind of dry but still good. My friend is still not fond of this place but he did like the sprouts. My point is this. I like eating at casual places that offer not only the meats I like, but side dishes you don't often see at other places. And if it sounds like I am rating them based on the brussel sprouts, well I am. They are delicious! And I will be back.",

Went with the kids (12 & 9)  and sat at the bar on a Friday night. Found the service to be good and we order a good spectrum of the menu to really try the food. Started with the fried Kale. It's Kale and its fried and its Kale and let's move on... Next up was the  improper charcuterie. Ribs were a miss (dry). Brisket fair, pulled pork was good, sausage was good but unremarkable. Pimento cheese nothing to write home about. Next up was the chicken nachos for the wife. Sent it back because the pimento cheese was cold and then we were informed that is how they serve it so it wouldn't congeal. Well I guess we just don't know how to eat pimento cheese properly but that dish was not very good. The chicken in it was quite tasty but the cheese.  next to the kids. Son had grilled pimento cheese sandwich took one bite and was done. Daughter had mac and cheese and said it was terrible. Now I know what your going to say that kids can be picky eaters, but we like to eat out and don't mind traveling uptown, Southpark, Noda, Plaza midwood... Wherever there is good food to be had. We eat out 2-3 times a week and have tried a lot of cue joints in town. When your kids put a good dent in a hot box of Krispy Kremes on the way home and the wife still has to feed them when we get home!.. Well we probably won't be back anytime soon.

He asked that it be cooked medium.  He received a very well done burger that was incredibly dry.  When he asked about it, our waitress told him they could only cool it to that temperature because of the pork belly they added.  That might have been helpful to know when ordering.  Overall the entire time our waitress continually forgot to bring us very basic things, like beverages, sauce, our check.  Finally after waiting my husband found her talking to her coworkers and gave her our card to run.  She seemed annoyed by that as well.

    "text": "After meaning to stop into this place much sooner, recently got the chance to try the Improper Pig. Had the Southern Eggroll, which was only OK (thought the choice to build it around the sweet potato hash was odd)...luckily, everything was uphill from there. The meats (pulled pork + pork ribs) were great, and definitely aided by the variety of sauces available (my fav was the spicy, with the Queen Bee a close 2nd). But the real test was the sides, and they passed with flying colors. The jalapeno cheese grits were awesome, and the mac-n-cheese was on point. Tried my wife's collard greens as well - tasty, if a little too vinegar-y. Overall, absolutely enjoyed my meal. My only complaints were the so-so appetizer and the lack of wet naps (a very obvious + disappointing ommission, though). Other than that, this place hit all the marks for an authentic BBQ joint - right down to the annoying fly bothering me up under the table.",

    "text": "Now that I've moved to Cotswald, decided to check out The Improper Pig tonight. I just opened in December. My dad and his wife, my wife, and even my 14-month old son were amazed at the quality of the food. They had 6 sauces to choose from (well, one was Frank's Red Hot, so I guess 5). Mustard, Eastern NC, Western NC, Spicy Hoisin, and Thai. This place touts itself as an Asian inspired BBQ joint, and does well at just that without pulling too far away from the roots of NC BBQ (and other states, too). I had, and I must recommend if you go there, the Improper Charcuterie. It's basically a sampler plate. You get pulled pork, andouille sausage, beef brisket, St. Louis style ribs, house made salt and vinegar chips with pimento cheese to dip, a tiny cornbread muffin, and slaw. It's hard for me to pick a favorite meat because everything was phenomenal. And the sauces...oh, the sauces! The NC Eastern was a bit sweeter than I'm used to, but still had enough spice and a prefect pairing to the pulled pork. The NC Western had a nice spicy kick, more like hot Memphis sauce actually, and went perfectly with the ribs. The mustard was great (though I didn't really have a great pairing for it meat-wise), the spicy hoisin was a perfect pairing to the beef brisket, and the Thai sauce was awesome on the southern egg roll, which was made with sweet potatoes inside. I was skeptical about a sweet potato egg roll, mainly because I'm not crazy about sweet potatoes, but it was only $2.50, so I couldn't resist and it was worth it. And it was pretty big - 7 or 8 bites at least. I don't think I'll ever come back here without getting one.  I was really hoping for a good barbecue joint in my new 'hood, and I hit the jackpot tonight. This place is great!",

The second time I went was even better than the first, they're still pretty new, but I think the place is flowing now. Portions are good, sauces are homemade and you add your own at the table. There are vegetarian options as well as carnivorous ones, so it's a crowd pleaser. I typically leave both full and with a box for later. Prices are reasonable and I've had great service both times. One of my dining partners has food allergies, and they were more than accommodating for him as well. Check it out!",

Check out the jalapeno cheese grits or the black eyed pea salad for your side and make sure you get an ice cream sandwich before you leave :)",

The staff was extremely friendly and greeted us immediately. There was a short wait which they ensured it would be worth the wait. We were told 15 minutes and were seated within that time frame. Decor in the restaurant was unique and I felt cozy and enjoyed it. Very raw, with metal and non-treated woods as accents. I love that the draft beer list was all local to NC!! I would like to see them laminate the menus at some point. It's very clean inside and waiting staff is attentive without being overbearing. Ordered margaritas and twice baked jalapenos to start. I ordered pork platter with spicy green beans,my boyfriend the smoked chicken and barbecue platter. We agree the pork is good, and conversation with whom seemed to be one of the owners told us it is smoked in house for about 8 hours. We have a favorite BBQ joint in NY that is hard to compare to, but we think this is a good place. Boyfriend says chicken was good but slightly bland, but very moist. He thinks almost too moist that it became pastyThe Mama B's BBQ sauce was my favorite sauce, with a little spice and a little sweet. Green beans were amazing!!  The only thing we can say about the BBQ is maybe a little more smokey in flavor would be excellent. But enjoyed our meal, with no complaints. We will come back and support. To close, I love the little unique touches on how they serve the meals (stainless steel baking sheets) and how they serve the checks (piece of wood with a clip). Definitely worth checking out!",

Choice of BBQ roasted whole Chicken or pulled pork with generous  portion of 2 sides.

    "text": "So I'm not certain this will be on my radar to revisit, but it was an overall good experience. First off the staff is incredibly friendly and prompt. Everything on the menu sounded great and the sides were divided by price. Just so you know if you order an item that \"comes with sides\" that what it really means that is comes with the $3 sides not the $4 sides. They are very up front about it which I can appreciate, but seems a bit extreme considering their prices are already kind of up there. Don't go by the menu online as those prices are no longer valid. They've raised the prices by a good $2-3. I ended up getting the Cotswald plate with pulled pork, mac and cheese, and spicy green beans. My aunt got the ribs with Mac and cheese and potato hash. First things first, the pulled pork was good but it came out cold. Like seriously cold. I didn't send it back so Or mention it because I was in a hurry but I was disappointed. They have a million sauces you can try. I think the vinegar based sauce was the best one for the pork. The waitress said the Mac and cheese was awesome, but I only thought it was okay, but the spicy green beans were yummy (albeit not spicy). I expected to love the sweet potato hash but I wasn't impressed. One thing I was impressed with though were the chairs... I know a weird thing to bring up, but they were sooo comfortable!!",

Presentation of the food was very good and place was very clean and kind of a upscale bbq joint look to it and the food came out fast. But it was all down hill after that. With this being my first time i wanted to try the sampler so i got \"The Improper Charcuterie\" which includes pulled pork, Brisket,Ribs,Andouille Sausage,BBQ Chips,Slaw and pimento cheese.   So everyone knows you can judge a BBQ joint by their brisket with that being said i pulled the brisket piece apart and tender but extremely dry, still trying to figure out how you can have a tender piece of meat and be so dry, the flavor of the bark was good. The pulled pork had a nice size portion and good color to it but extremely dry even with the sauces they give. The ribs {2 bones} probably the best part of the meal had good flavor but again over cooked and they left the membrane skin on. The Andouille sausage was ok at best but again over cooked. Not sure if you are getting the theme here??? :) Pimento cheese had some weird after taste to it. Which was disappointing because i absolutely love pimento cheese. They had like 5 BBQ sauces that were Meh and franks hot sauce. I think the pricing was pretty steep as well. $24 for a full rack of ribs, $22 for a 10 oz ribeye and my platter wasn't as bad at $16.   On a bright note the Slaw was good and the BBQ Chips had great flavor but then again basically the two smallest things on the platter.   Verdict: Sorry Improper Pig, I will be driving the extra 5 minutes over to Midwood Smokehouse to get my BBQ and the best brisket in Charlotte.",

First, their small draft list consists of all local brews and it sounds like they constantly rotate out. I had the devil's britches and old meck's smoked Amber. My friend had the Mary's margarita that I tried and you can tell it's made with all fresh ingredients. Second, the service was incredible! Simone read our table so well. We were there to kill some time and not in any sort of hurry. She helped us with the menu and all of her recommendations were perfect. We never felt rush and we never felt like a burden. Also, she is adorable and super sweet. Kudos for the beaming smile! Finally, the food. AMAZING! We started with the nachos with shaved chicken. House made salt and vinegar chips with house made pimento and super tender and smoked chicken. We took this opportunity to sample all the sauces which were great.  As we were getting full we began thinking the we two ladies would not be able to consume two entrees. Simmone to the rescue. She suggested we share a platter. We split the pulled pork platter with two sides. We had the amazing Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding, the sprouts beat the Mac and that's not a dis on the pasta.  All and all, we had a fantastic Saturday lunch! So glad we chose this spot with so many places in the area.",

    "text": "3.5 stars. This big is improper. You must have BBQ when you're in the Carolinas. Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too packed. We were seated at a high top table and I started off with a sweet tea. I went with the pulled pork sandwich which is served with your choice of side. Went with the mac and cheese.  The nice thing about The Improper Pig is they have about six BBQ sauces for you to choose from: a ketchup-based BBQ, a vinegar-based one, a Thai one, and several other choices. I'm all about variety and several of the sauces are excellent. On the downside, you have to squirt the sauce on your plate and sauces start intermingling. It would be nice if they had individual containers. The BBQ was a bit dry but still was good when doused in sauce. The mac and cheese was average. I did try my buddies sweet potato fries and that's the way to to go. Waffle sweet potato fries. That is a winning side in my book.",

My dinner experience was also great. I ordered the bbq chicken plate with 2 sides. I got the sweet potato hash and crowder peas. The sweet potato hash was savory which I truly enjoyed. Sweet potatoes don't always have to be super sweet like a dessert. The crowded peas were very hard but when I mentioned it to someone they replaced it immediately. I ended up with the green beans which were pretty much the best I've ever eaten. Now I'm craving them for breakfast the next day. I will be back soon!",

My second visit to Improper Pig did not disappoint my out of town guests and the runaway favorite was their chao bao taco with green beans. Seriously, don't even consider getting anything else, just order it and go home happy.  We went for lunch on a random Monday and had the entire patio to ourselves, which was perfect for an 18-month old to wander around and not get into trouble. Our waiter could not have been more friendly and accommodating, so five stars for service.  While Cotswold may not come to mind as a Charlotte food destination hotspot, Improper Pig helped put the Queen City on the map with their DDD feature. There are plenty of options for BBQ around, including my favorites Midwood Smokehouse and City Barbeque, but Improper Pig can scratch a different itch with Asian flavors. Easy to recommend and nice to get to a neighborhood that I don't normally frequent.",

We were seated right when we walked in and ordered drinks (Stella for me, margarita for him). We were both pleased with our drinks (he described his as tart but good).   We started with the pork roll, which was really good but a not so good portion size. It is listed as an appetizer but is more like a side item. It is one egg roll cut in half. It was good but for the price, you should at least get two!  My fella had the improper charcuterie, which he loved. In fact he told me that he doesn't think he would order anything else. I had the salmon chow bao taco with green beans. I liked both. The slaw on the taco lacked flavor so I ended up just taking most of it off, but it was tasty and I loved the sauce on the salmon. The green beans are awesome! I could eat them all day every day!  Overall, it was a date night success. We will be back!",

The wings are saucy and meaty and cream cheese and chorizo is the perfect mixture with the spice of the jalapenos! If you like egg rolls and you like pulled pork, you will love the Pork Roll. The Improper Charcuterie has all the meats and the pimento cheese with the chips is a wonderful side. The Spicy Green Beans were a great add-on! The sauces were tasty and the Tong's Thai was a nice twist with the pulled pork. Though spicy, the Jalapeno Cheese Grits were amazing and I don't eat grits... EVER! The Cotswold Burger was delicious, however, the bun is very thin and got soggy with the pork and slaw on top, and I will avoid the sweet potatoes hash next time as there is a strong vinegar taste. Overall, was an amazing experience with great service and wonderful food in a very family friendly environment!",

To say I was disappointed is an understatement...I opted for the Cotswald Platter and chose the pulled pork and pulled chicken with baked beans and mac n cheese. While the food came out quickly my server neglected to properly set me up with silverware...got it only after I asked for it. The restaurant was relatively empty my server seemed disconnected having only checked on me once..which was to drop the check.  The sauces were on the bar and the server basically just slid them in front of with no explanation of the different flavors or types of sauce they offered. The pork was a bit salty and has little to no smokey flavor to it. The chicken was moist but lacked flavor...sauce helped but again no smoke. As for the portions they were small and to be honest as I sit here writing this review I can honestly say that I'm still a bit hungry.  I would probably not go out of my way to dine there again.",

The fella and I ventured over on a Wednesday night around 8:00, and we were immediately greeted by a super nice, chatty host. He seated us, and our waitress appeared just a few minutes later.  It took me forever to decide what I wanted because everything looked so good! I finally landed on the Chow Bao Taco with pulled pork and a side of Brussels sprouts. The taco came in a steamed bao bun, which I've never had before, and it was doughy but delicious and light. The pulled pork was so fresh, too! I could've eaten 3 more of them. The sprouts were okay, but nothing to write home about.  The fella went with the pulled pork & slaw sandwich (which he figured was like Mac's Lil Pig) and a side of spicy green beans. He said the beans were good but the sandwich beats Mac's... a bold statement for the fella.   The atmosphere was pretty cool with a comfy wooden/aluminum vibe, there was easy parking in the Costwold lot, and they had fair prices. The beer selection was just okay, but the bourbon list was pretty awesome (except there weren't prices on those... hmmm).",

Things were a little slow to come together, but once the drinks and food starting flowing, everyone had a great time.  I wanted to try one of everything so the charcuterie offered sausage, rib, pulled pork, and brisket.  Was not a huge fan of their homemade chips, but the pimiento and slaw were very yummy sides.  Juicy, flavorful meats, 6 sauces to choose from and sturdy napkins (essential in any BBQ joint!) Speaking of yummy - GET THE GRITS!! Oh Em Gee.  You're Welcome :)  Bathrooms are clean, ample parking, crowd was not rowdy on a Monday evening.  I'll have to remember next time to ask about their Improper Pig mascot/theme.",

Each month they have a handful of selections that are only available that month. Such a creative way to keep customers coming back for more and not get tired of grabbing to-go dinner after a long day of work. The food is great, of course. We just love seeing what they will come up with each month!",

    "text": "Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 3.65 Stars  I feel kind of generous giving The Improper Pig 4 stars....for the reasons I'm about to share with you. But overall, I had a GREAT time with Marco F and Allyson D, and we all enjoyed the food and drinks!  I ordered the Double Baked Jalapenos with cream cheese and chorizo filling. Now these were REALLY great! Basically one bite wonders....  Well I wanted to sample what this restaurant is all about, so I got the Improper Charcuterie, which was basically pulled pork, brisket, ribs, andouille, pimento cheese, slaw, and pickled onions. Let's go over one by one....  Pulled pork: Yummy goodness! Had to be pork shoulder as it was moist and tender. Brisket: Kind of dry, but had good flavor. Ribs: Average at best. Andouille: Reminded me more of a Portugese Linguica than an Andouille, but was OK. Their pimento cheese was REALLY good! Went great with their delicious homemade chips. Slaw wasn't bad at all, and the pickled onions provided a refreshing palate clense after all that meat!  Sauces were interesting. See my picture of the various sauces offered. The two I did NOT care for were the mustard and the Eastern NC vinegar. Just not my thing. The Hoisin was really good, but I felt that it was out of place given the food I was eating. I tried it on my ribs but I just didn't think it went. My buddy Marco loved it though. To each his own.....But I did use the Queen Bee more than any other sauce as this was a classic Sweet (Georgia-style) BBQ sauce that went well with all the meats I had on my plate. Definitely my fave of the night!  Service was decent, but our waitress did seem to disappear for long stretches....hummmm.   Smaller than usual selection of beers on tap...I'd have liked to see more Charlotte and/or NC beers offered. What's with the IPAs? How about more strong ales and Porter/Stouts?  Overall I did enjoy The Improper Pig. I wasn't invited to the Yelp Elite event here so that's why I wanted to check this out tonight. They do sell your favorite meats by the pound, FYI.",

Love the Asian BBQ fusion. Service was quick and attentive. I went with the BBQ chicken, sweet potato hash and the Brussels. Really like the Brussels. The sweet potato hash was tasty but more like a mash. The chicken was tender. The sauce gave it flavor. Wife had the Asian salad and we both loved that. I would go back to try the special burger or sandwich and maybe go more on the Asian side.",

The food.. no flavor.. the brisket tastes like pot roast. The chicken semi-dry and also is lacking flavor. Nothing tasted as if it had been smoked. The ribs were tough. The collards had too much vinegar.  The semi pleasurable items were the southern egg rolls and green beans. I do not understand or cannot comprehend how this place received a 4 out of 5. The server had an attitude as we explained our grievances, which in turn made the manager apprehensive to approach our table. The plates ARE OVERPRICED for the caliber of food you receive. If you want a good margarita, this is the place or if you want great hot sauce (you can purchase in a grocery storee) this is the place. Horrible experience! Won't be coming back.

    "text": "Today my work associates and I stopped by the Improper Pig for lunch at the Cotswold location. I have heard good things about this place before, but I was not prepared for how absolutely delicious the food would be.  We were greeted, welcomed and sat immediately on their spacious, comfortable outside patio. We were also greeted by our server within moments of sitting at the table, who had a great attitude and gave us prompt service throughout the meal. Our waters were never empty and that is quite refreshing on a warm patio.  The manager Christian came by to greet us and discuss the specials and his favorite menu items, which sounded so fabulous, one of my associates ended up going with his suggestion of the ribs - he was not disappointed.  Our meal started off with an order of the Twice Baked Jalapenos appetizer. The cilantro lime crema and spiciness was absolutely amazing. The manager even gave us a tip to try it with the sweet and sour sauce, which helped balance out the spice. These were so delicious, I could have eaten an entire plate of them for my entree.  Our table ordered the following: St Louis Style Ribs with a side of Sweet Potato Hash and Green Beans, BBQ Salad with pulled pork, Pulled pork platter with black bean salad side, and my choice, the special burger, the Belly Burger.  Every entree was met with extreme satisfaction - ribs were cooking to perfection, the BBQ salad in my associates words was \"the best BBQ salad I have ever had\", and my burger was so good, I ate every single bite on my plate.  The Belly Burger was 70% Beef, 30% pork, blue cheese, special sweet Mary's BBQ, pickled onions, arugula, and tomato. I worked at Bad Daddy's for almost four years and in my entire time working there, haven't had a burger as tasty as this one. So absolutely phenomenal. The homemade chips were delicious as well that came on the side.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that hasn't tried. While reviewing their menu, I noticed a ton of options for all types of eaters - tofu, vegetarian, gluten free, vegan, etc. They also appeared to have a nice bar selection, although this was a work lunch so we did not delve too much into those options! Service was impeccable and the manager Christian was extremely welcoming and informative on the menu. We are now Raving Fans and can't wait to come back!!",

So not a True test.   Bonus: It's the only place this far that serves pork and slaw egg rolls. Worthy of it's price at $4.   Bottom line. The Improper pig would be a huge hit if it were located in a place without such stellar BBQ - like the Midwest. But in CLT, it falls to the bottom of the list due to it's high prices for small portion of average food.",

The Mac n cheese was cheesy but just normal m&c,  The brisket & pork were well-cooked and flavorful but they need to go a little lighter on the tenderizer.

They have really transformed this little space and I'm so glad they have!  On our visit we were quickly seated and our server came right over. The menu isn't extensive but it's got loads of options and what really kills me is there are monthly specials. It was a hard decision but I had to choose one of the specials.   This months specials are the Mac and Cheese BBQ Burrito and the BBQ  Fried Rice. Since I love all things Asian Fusion I had to try the BBQ Fried Rice with BBQ pork. I also added the andouille sausage to the entree.   This dish was a very large portion and I had enough for lunch the next day. There a lot of crispy BBQ pieces through out the dish and the sauce that accompanies the rice along with the Queen Bee BBQ sauce really set it apart from other fried rice dishes I've had.   Two of my friends had the Cotswold Platter. One had the Platter with BBQ Pork and BBQ tofu. I'm not the hugest fan of tofu but this had a good taste. It wasn't the firm type of tofu but held its ground with the BBQ pork. The sides that they got were the green beans and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was very runny and she needed a spoon. The other Cotswold Platter had BBQ Chicken and BBQ Pork, Collard greens and  the Jalapeno  grits. All very good choices. My other friend tried the other special the Mac and Cheese BBQ Burrito. I got a little taste of this and the flavors work so well together.  Another great thing they got going on is a wide variety of BBQ sauces. My fav from the options was the Queen Bee. What I can remember is the Tong's Thai is a very runny sauce that looks like sweet chili sauce.   I was torn between the special and The BBQ salad so I will have to return and try the salad and perhaps some of the other monthly specials.",

They have a BBQ sauce for every taste and the cocktail menu is extensive (The Lavender Lemonade Martini is my favorite!)  The service is spot on and the ambiance is relaxing and fun.  I make it a point to visit T.I.P. every time I visit Charlotte.",

    "text": "After doing much research about good bbq places in Charlotte, I came upon this gem. We came in for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. We ordered the nachos and smokes wings for appetizers. The wings had fantastic smoke flavor and were nice and crispy. The cheese sauce for the nachos was a pimento cheese sauce that I had been longing to try whilst down south, and it lived up to my expectations. We ordered ribs, brisket, smoked chicken, and pork. All was delicious. I had the ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone tender. The rub used had just the right about of heat and sweetness, that I didn't even need to use 1 of their 6 bbq sauces offered.  When our food arrived, a man, who seemed to be manager, happily described the 5 sauces on the table, with the addition of a spicier, asian inspired sauce available by request.  To top off the amazing lunch we had, the manager came by our table again, asking if we would be interested in a strawberry cobbler on the house. Of course, I said yes. The cobbler consisted of a sweet and crunchy crumb-cookie topping, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a delicious, warm strawberry center.  The service was very friendly and hands on. I would definitely come here again when passing through Charlotte.",

I had brisket with jalapeno grits and Brussel Sprouts, and it was the best brisket I've had in Charlotte. Moist, tender, perfectly smoked, not too fatty, and not too lean and very delicious.  The jalapeno grits were (OMG) so creamy and addictively tasty. I could eat them every day, seriously. My son had pulled pork, which I also tasted, and it was fantastic. The only thing I didn't sample was my wife's Korean BBQ salmon, but honestly it was all good and we can't wait to go back again.  Service was fast and friendly.

One would assume being featured would mean the food is superb...until you realize it was Dinner, Drive in and Dives and you figure out Guy has zero tastes in good food.   Ordered the Cotswold plate with pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and collard greens. The food came our quickly, but the compliments unfortunately end there. The collards were nice and spicy, but lacked flavor. The Mac and cheese was overcooked and underseasoned, think instant Mac. And the BBQ while decent was not super smokey. Oh and the cornbread was a bite size muffin not sure maybe it was made for ants.   Sampled all the BBQ sauce as well. 1. Queen Bee- too sweet 2. Mary B's also coyingly sweet 3. Tony's Thai was basically sweet and sour sauce. I will say the mustard sauce was good if that is your thing and the vinegar was nicely spiced albeit too sweet as well.   To make matters worse the place was relatively empty and yet I only saw my waiter twice. I took about twenty minutes to eat and my server was to never be seen again until the bill came. Never even asked how the food was or if I needed anything.  I personally will be sticking to Midwood Smokehouse. This place could be great though if they just worked on the food and service. At least they have good beer specials $4 local pints on Sunday.",

    "text": "Like a previous reader I too wanted to like this place more than I did. This was my second time visiting.   Ambience is cool, whoever designed the place should be proud. Need a better choice of music to complement the design. Too much like the lobby of a W hotel.   Seated promptly. Served promptly. Attentive service but felt hurried at end even with no people waiting for tables. Felt like I didn't even put my fork down before waiter was over asking if I was done. Best part of a BBQ joint is picking over your plate long after you're \"done\".   Kids had pulled pork sammys with Mac n cheese. Sammys were good. Mac n cheese was grainy if that's a word. Like the flour didn't have time to dissolve or something. Could have used more kick or sharpness too.   I had the BBQ charcuterie plate and a side of Brussels sprouts. At $18 I was surprised at how small the portions were. Scratch that. Disappointed.   Came with andouille sausage, brisket, pulled pork and 2 ribs and a teeny tiny corn muffin, some orange stuff that I'm not sure about, cole slaw and some very good house made potato chips.   LOVED the ribs. Very good flavor and texture and color. By far the highlight. Second was the sausage which surprised me since I normally do do smoked sausage. Brisket was cut too thin and was dry. Wouldn't recommend. Pulled pork was ok. Not much flavor. Cole slaw might as well have come from the prepared food aisle at Harris Teeter. The Brussels sprouts were oh so disappointing. Overdone. Too much pepper. With all the great meats in this place, no clue why they sprouts aren't served more al dente with bacon or pulled pork and some carmelization. These were like the Brussels sprouts that everyone ate growing up resulting in all of us hating Brussels sprouts. Anyway.   Nice selection of sauces on the table, including a couple that are Asian themed. Only issue is that they have odd caps on the sauces which makes the sauce dribble out and all over the bottle making them sticky and sort of gross. The bring regular napkins to the table but BBQ needs a strong paper towel. Napkins don't do. And considering the sticky sauces, some wet wipes would be a good touch too.   All in all I would come back but specifically for the ribs and chips. And I would bring my own towel and wet wipes.",

Since it was my first visit I just wanted to start with the basics- a barbecue platter. The best sauce offering and cole slaw were both Asian inspired- I suspect these are the True strengths of the menu. Other items I had seemed to rely too much on heat spice for flavoring that it was overwhelming. Collards were good, but far too spicy. Pickled onions too strong. More spice in the cornbread. And with vinegar based BBQ sauces - it was all just too many flavors. Sweet potato hash was good, but not what I was expecting- this is more mashed potato than  hashbrowns (It also contained meat ). All the food was fresh, but quick serve meant not everything was terribly warm. Over all good experience and would go back to focus on more of the Asian items. Oh and of course those nachos!",

Our server suggested the Charcuterie Sampler and the Side Plate for us to share. Best idea ever! Thanks, Brittany! Hubby said the brisket rivals Jack's in Nashville--which is high praise indeed. So glad we found this spot. And slather the warmed pimento cheese on the sweet potato fries!",

Service was a little slow considering the restaurant was only half full, and prices were a little high, especially on the appetizers. One of the best things about the whole meal was the stuffed jalapenos but it was only 4 small little pieces for $6 or $7 and it left me wanting more, however, for that price I had to pass. Bartender was also a little inexperienced (you don't shake a Manhattan) and you don't upcharge a $4 special drink to $10 because you put it over ice and add a splash of vermouth.  I will definitely come back in a couple months and try this place again. Hopefully by then they've worked out the kinks.",

It was a ton of food for a good price. They had 6 sauces to have with our meats, which were all delicious. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and chatty, which was nice since it was one of our first meals out since moving to the area. We will definitely eat here again!",

    "text": "Here's a quick summary of the following novel: After my first lunch at The Improper Pig, here's my assessment. The pulled pork was delicious, the brisket the same though a little fatty, the mac and cheese was good, stay away from the sweet potato hash, and don't sit at the high tables. For an in-depth review, keep reading.  The Meal  I ordered the Cotswold Platter, which consisted of 2 meats and 2 sides. I chose the brisket (which happened to be a slightly-shady extra $4, but I'll talk about that more later) and the pulled pork for my meats. The sides available were pretty varied, but my first choice was the mac and cheese (what I believe to be a staple in any good BBQ restaurant). For my second side, I decided to try the sweet potato hash, something I had never heard of and was interested in.  We'll start with the meats:    The pulled pork was fantastic. I have found that I'm hard to please with pulled pork, and this really hit the spot. It was very flavorful and moist enough that it didn't require any sauce to eat (I like the flavor of good barbecue without dousing it in sauce). Quite possibly the best pulled pork I've had in Charlotte.    The beef brisket, while a little on the fatty side, was also delicious. My favorite brisket in Charlotte still comes from Lancaster BBQ, but this was a close second. Improper's version is more pulled than sliced, which was a nice change, and was good enough to eat by itself. The extra fat took it down a slight notch, but the flavor was great.    With the meats, there are 5 or 6 different options for sauces. There's a Thai sauce, mustard BBQ, regular BBQ (tomato), Eastern NC BBQ (vinegar), and Frank's Redhot (I forget if there's another). The Thai was sweet with a little spice, very good. The mustard, which is my favorite usually, was very good here also.  As for the sides, the mac and cheese was good, nothing to write home about, but a strong staple and something I would order again. A little more saucy than some of the baked versions you'll find at other BBQ joints, but good none-the-less. The sweet potato hash, on the other hand, was a disappointment. My coworkers and I all agreed that we could definitely have done without it. What it seemed to be was a version of sweet potato casserole without brown sugar; a bland mash, maybe slightly bitter, with no real redeeming quality unfortunately.  The meal also came with what looked like a cornbread cookie and some red onions (maybe pickled onions? I didn't try them, I thought they were maybe just for show). The cornbread was alright, it didn't really add or detract from the meal. But then again, I'm used to a larger portion of moist cornbread, maybe with a little bit of honey, and I might just be spoiled.  All in all, the meal was good, with one regrettable side choice, but I would otherwise order it again. Good flavors and good portions.  The Rest  The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated, the kitchen is open and visible, and it felt appropriate for a nicer BBQ restaurant. Not much to talk about, save for two things. One, they should put some sort of blinds or window covering on the larger windows as it is darker inside, and the outside light can be a little blinding. Two, they need to get nicer chairs for the high tables. The chairs they have seem to be there for looks more than functionality. The seats are small (I bet they're not far off from 9 in x 9 in) and are just plain uncomfortable. The booths seem like they sit nice, and the higher chairs at the bar seem nice. But the chairs at the high tables are a bit of an inconvenience.  As someone with just enough graphic design understanding to get himself in trouble, the menu made me cringe a bit. The layout doesn't flow well at all, and its confusing to read at first. Once you can figure out where everything is, it isn't hard, but I feel like it shouldn't be that hard to read a one page menu. Not a big deal, just a random quirk. Do pay attention though to the prices. The menu does a poor job of letting you know about extra costs. The brisket is apparently an extra $4, I'm assuming for all entrees, and it wasn't immediately apparent to me. Just something to keep an eye out for.  If you're still reading, you're a trooper :-)  To finish this book, after my lunch experience, I will most likely be heading back to The Improper Pig, but with a better understanding of the menu, the cost, and the seating. I can't stay away from a place with meat this good, I just hope I can find some sides that match in flavor!",

She sure did hustle when we asked for the check though! She waited right near our table as we signed our bill/tipped on the credit card slip. Oh well... Anyway, the food was just... blah. I had their BBQ meatloaf that was on special, sweet potatoes & cheese grits. My meatloaf was very a small portion & extremely dry & thin- for $11 at a BBQ joint, I would expect to get a decent serving size. The cheese grits were pretty good but oh my goodness, those sweet potatoes they served me were absolutely awful! The consistency was grainy & it didn't taste like any sweet potatoes I've ever had. Not sure what they mixed in with the potatoes but it tasted more like refried beans that you'd get from a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend also agreed they were pretty bad. Even if I did want to eat it, it was extremely hot & didn't even cool down before we left the restaurant. My boyfriend had a couple different tacos & said they were mediocre at best. I really wanted to like this place since everyone was so nice & it's a cute, cool little place but I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. With so many great places to get BBQ in CLT, I think they need to majorly step their game up!",

THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! I feel like I am probably going to become on a first name basis with the people that work here. The food is different but is the perfect combination of everything delicious you could think of. I literally want to try everything on the menu.  I love the pulled pork sandwhich with sweet potatoes fries (with a side of ranch for those) and the mac and cheese is good too. Today for lunch I got a pulled chicken BBQ salad...I could have eaten five of them it was so good.  The people that work here are extremely personable and I could not be happier to see this restaurant come to Cotswold.  Keep up the good work! I can't wait to try something new next time!

To begin with the cleanest version of jalapeno poppers we have ever had that were roasted and so delicious to the \"Cotswold Platter\" to the Southwestern Chopped salad with tasty ripe avocados throughout , and to finish with the improper pork sliders for the kiddies. What a great, \"go to place\". The atmosphere was nice and peaceful on a Tuesday night with many tables outside we had a few choices to sit inside not on top of people with our kiddies.

Not only was the food quick and delicious, the service was impeccable!  I can not press enough, just how attentive and helpful the entire staff was at this restaurant.  Every employee who walked by us, offered to help and made sure everything was to our liking.  Service trumps EVERYTHING to me.  Anyone can make great food, but if there isn't good service to deliver that food, nobody wants to eat there!    That being said, we really enjoyed our food!  The nachos we ordered came out super fast and were yummy.  I didn't LOVE them, but they were good.  They had melted pimento cheese and brisket on them...so...enough said!  We both got the Cotswald Platter, getting the pulled pork and mac 'n' cheese!  John also got the Cheesy Jalapeno Grits (think Flying Biscuit's creamy dreamy grits, with a little kick!) and I got the brussel sprouts, hoping that it would help balance out all the not-so-healthy food I was planning to induldge with!  Everything was super tasty here.  We will certainly be back...unless our resolution to lose weight and be healthier (ha) actually goes into effect!",

    "text": "Kale chips had a definite bbq flavor.  I added the Mary's BBQ sauce.  On the initial visit, had the pulled pork sandwich w/chips & my dining companion had the ribs & sweet potato fries.  Both meats were extremely dry.  There was a ton of slaw as garnish on the pulled pork which would make it difficult to eat by putting the top & bottom buns together.  I ate the sandwich as 2 parts.  There are 6 different sauces on the table to allow the consumer to decide how much sauce & what kind should season their sandwich.  It just didn't help the ribs or the pulled pork become any less dry.  Our 2nd visit was great timing on a Sat right before it seems all the kids soccer games let out.  I had the shrimp tacos w/the jalapeno cheese grits & my significant other one of the specials of the day - the bellybuster sandwich which was a combination of pork & hamburger w/chips.  The shrimp was hard to locate under all the Asian slaw.  It felt like a salad w/a bbq sauce that had a real kick.  The jalapeno cheese grits were tasty w/the right amount of heat from the jalapenos for a person that doesn't like spice.   The Bellybuster went half eaten not because of the size - more so again somehow it was a bit on the dry side.  The spicy green beans were thoroughly enjoyed.  For dessert, decided to give a  cobbler a go.  This is not the crumbly type of cobbler but a small round cake w/no taste sandwiched between a single scoop of vanilla ice cream & berries.  it is served in a cast iron skillet.  Ditch the cake & serve the berries w/2 scoops of ice cream & we would've been much happier campers.  Overall both experiences were ok.  The chips are supposed to be salt/vinegar.  They don't have a discernible salt & vinegar taste.  It is hard to tell if they are made in house.  The chips seem like they could come from a bag.  Suggestion would be to make them similar to the kale chips & have the option of the salt/vinegar as well.  The menu has a wide selection for Vegetarians or Gluten dietary needs.  Both are clearly marked.",

Both meats were tender and juicy (did find a bone in my chicken though) and the sauces are all delicious. The mac and cheese was a definite highlight.

The full bar is good and the cocktail I had was decent.  There is not really much atmosphere inside, but bbq is not really known for being a trendy place.   The sweet potato hash side was actually gross as it had this weird bbq sauce taste in it so I only tried one spoonful of it and gave up on it. The improper nachos appetizer was not well executed either since it wasn't even nachos, it was greasy potato chips covered in cheese so give that one a pass as well.",

Sorry to say, that Outback has their ribs beat. Dry, smoked, sauce less. Yes, I get that the sauce is on the table and you can add at free will, but why not make a traditional rib with BBQ sauce for those who don't want to try 6 different sauces to find one? Kids will want a BBQ sauce rib that doesn't taste smoky. Some adults might too.  The jalapeno cheese grits were good, the sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese were too. Nothing exceptional, but tasted good. Collards were not my thing.  The service was attentive. Dimmer lighting might be nice. Tables are so close together that something has to help the ambience so lighting would go a long way. With some work on the menu, I would give them another shot.",

Tried the Cotswold Plate with beef brisket with sweet potato waffle fries and Asian slaw. Brisket was a fatty mess! I think I had 4 bites out of 3 slices that was meat not fat. The Asian slaw was just dry slaw mix out the bag, sweet potato fries had too much salt. The idea is to let the sweet potato flavor take over not drown the sweet potato out with salt. The little dry rock, I mean cornbread muffin was disgusting. Just not a good lunch at all. Mr. had 2 meat platter with smoked chicken which was dry no flavor and pulled pork. Sides were collard greens and jalapeno cheese grits. They both were okay. So basically the sides are the better items minus the cornbread. I say keep your money. THE PICS represent what was left when we left the establishment. No to go boxes for us which we ALWAYS take our leftovers but no need here.",

We also had the improper nachos as an appetizer. The pimento cheese with the salt and vinegar chips was the proper combination of flavor.  Now, I am not a desert person, probable ordered desert less than 5 times in my life. However, the cobbler was calling my name. It was blueberry for this month so we decided to give it a try. Tasted like grandma was In the back whipping it up. It was nice and hot with some yummy vanilla ice cream. Atmosphere was nice in a good location. Can't wait to go back to try the regular menu.",

Even without the discount, the food here is well priced and you get plenty for your money. If I were trying to categorize this restaurant, I'd describe it as BBQ fusion -- and it works!  We began our meal with a Southern Egg Roll -- delicious!! The sweetness of the sweet potato with the spiciness of the hot mustard for dipping were perfect.  For the entree, I ordered the Chow Bao Taco -- if it is good enough for Triple D and Guy Fieri, I want to try it!  It did not disappoint. The hoison sauce and Asian slaw change southern barbecue into something else!  My husband ordered the BBQ sandwich with pulled pork.  This is served with an array of sauces brought to the table.  My husband's favorite was the mustard style sauce, while I enjoyed the unique Tong's Thai.    What really sets The Improper Pig apart from other barbecue restaurants is their choice of sides.  I had the jalapeno grits -- creamy, mild, and delicious.  My husband ordered the spicy green beans -- which lean a little more to sweet than spicy, but were one of the highlights of the meal -- cooked perfectly crisp tender.  The Improper Pig also has nightly drink specials.  On Tuesdays, you can get half off of select wine by the glass and $5 margaritas.  I tried the Jalapeno Margarita and was not disappointed.    Service was on point as our server Jamie was helpful in suggesting things to try and made sure that we had everything we needed during the meal.  A manager or owner also checked in on us at one point.  This is a casual restaurant, so no need to get dressed up.  The whole family can come.  We will definitely be back to enjoy this local gem!",

Sadly, terrible service is the main reason for this one star review. Here are the highlights of our experience:  Our server delivered warm sweet tea with no ice.   Walked past us many many many times before coming back to take our order - we were there for at least 20 minutes before we actually ordered. In general, I estimate she apologized for things taking so long 3x while we were there.   We obviously didn't like our food, but weren't asked. The manager asked the table next to us how their food was - and didn't ask us or stop by at all.   We sat for a good 10-15 minutes, clearly finished, when the hostess asked if she could clear our table - and she took one small appetizer plate and left all the other plates.   Waited another 5 before our server decided to drop off the check. Didn't ask about the unfinished food. Didn't ask if we wanted a box. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. Didn't clear the table. Clearly knew we were not happy and just wanted us to go (we wanted to go too).   Then she gave us a pen with no ink. Sigh.   Over an hour for a bbq dinner seems long. the family next to us ordered when we were eating our appetizer and left before us.   We are pretty easy going, but @ $50 for dinner for 2, we would expect decent service at the least.",

From the time you walk in you know this is a bbq joint. The aroma of smoked meat feels the atmosphere.  I got the smoked chicken wings and the southwest chopped salad with pulled chicken. Both were incredible and the salad was pretty filling. Make sure you try the collard greens which are vegetarian but taste like they were cooked by someone's grandma!  They have two locations one in Charlotte and one in Fort Mill hope they will put one in the university or Concord area soon! They have also been featured on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives for those who watch the show. They have drink specials every day. I went on a Saturday and the special was was margaritas. The peach margarita was really good and definitely would order it again. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall I was very pleased with my decision on choosing the Improper Pig for lunch on the last day of the Yelp Restaurant Week.",

The environment was fun and modern. However, the food was subpar. I got the Cotswold Burger and the toppings were good but the burger itself was dry. The Brussels sprouts tasted like kimchi and I wasn't a fan. The best thing we got all night were the spicy (not really) green beans and I would definitely recommend. The nachos were okay but the chips tasted kind of burnt.",

I would have been better off buying a few Slim Jim's at a convenience store.  I guess being in Cotswold makes the restaurant \"trendy\".  Such a shame that a restaurant that has \"Pig\" in it's title would have the worst ribs in Charlotte.",

Hint: the closing time on Saturday is 11pm but they started cleaning all around us to go for closing around 9:30pm. It felt kind of weird. So, my hint is to make sure you go and end your meal 1hr and 30mins prior to closing time.",

    "text": "Okay - it's taken a while to do a follow up review because I wanted to try as much from the menu as possible and dine in as well. As life would have it, I've only just recently gotten around to getting in there.  And the results are....  Hmmm. Weeeell...  Here's the deal folks. I LOVE BBQ! I grew up with it. I cook it at home, and I'll pick it almost over anything else that's fast and warm. This, however, does not make me a BBQ expert. That being said, I don't love their BBQ. The menu does have on it the usual BBQ items (pulled pork, brisket, ribs, etc.), but at the risk of upsetting the fragile Cotswold pallate, don't order those items. I love these guys and Cotswold is desperately missing a great BBQ joint, but this is not it. I know in my last review, I asked them not to mess around too much with BBQ, but they didn't listen to me, and mess around they have. And I'm glad they did!  Absolutely ALL of their appetizers are amaaaazing. You MUST try the BBQ Kale Chips, or the Improper Nachos. And I believe I've mentioned Twice-Baked Jalepenos previously. I mean, stuffed with cream cheese and chorizo? Can you find any reason to not want that?!? And their Good Luck Soup, albeit a bit messy to eat, is the perfect ping of pot-licker yumminess. Don't listen to their menu. It's nothing like Brunswick Stew. It IS like absolute tastiness! If there weren't so many other interesting things on the menu, I would just make a meal out of their apps. But if I did that, I would miss out on the tender Shrimp Tacos (although, their tortilla choice needs a bit of adjustment), or their Korean BBQ Salmon, or their Cowboy Rubbed Grilled Ribeye (perfectly cooked). And that would be a crying shame.  And their desserts! I've tried two of their cobblers. It's the kind of dessert that makes you feel guilty eating it, no matter how fit you are. And their Chocolate Cream Pie is the definition of decadence.   So, to sum up, I'm sorry. Truly. But if you want tender, slide off the bone, melt-in-your-mouth BBQ, this may not be the place for you. With my limited knowledge of BBQ preparation, just seems like they need a little more time - both on the grill and as a restaurant - to figure that part out.  But, if you want great service, fun environment, and something new and DELISH, please, please, please drop by the strangely and properly named Improper Pig. You will not regret it.",

I was disappointed with the chicken - it was dry and had been prepared with too much rub that just sat on the meat rather than imparting flavor. Collards were good, but the slaw was not flavorful. Tasted Like cabbage with a little vinegar. My husband's pulled pork was a little fatty. Will probably give it another try after they have had time to settle in a bit and make adjustments. It is so convenient and well-like cates that I hope it will become an institution.",

It took a while before any wait staff got to us and we ordered as soon as she came over to give us our drink. We ordered the Southwest egg rolls, Chow bow taco, and Cotswold platter.   -Southwest egg rolls---meh, nothing special. it just tasted like mashed sweet potatoes with bland collared greens -Chow bow taco--- I was really excited to try this bc I love the asian bao buns but the buns were so soggy that I couldnt even eat it. It tasted too dried out and too soggy at the same time! ew!  -Cotswold platter---this was a normal bbq platter. nothing really special. The one thing that was REALLY good was the little pimento cheese you get on the side of the platter! the pimento cheese was delicious!!  We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries ( bc they are my fav and I have to try them everywhere I go) and when it came out I was SO disappointed. It looked like I got the last of the batch or something and they were all burnt and soooo crispy to the point where it tasted like chips. We were going to say something to the waitress but unfortunately she never came back to ask us how the food was so we just left almost the whole plate of burnt fries with out getting eat it :( I can't believe the chef thought it was okay to serve that!! We also thought maybe thats the way they serve their sweet potato fries so we looked around but the sweet potato fries at other tables looked nice and plump and good so it was just our plate of fries that was bad. shame!    Overall we liked how you can try all the different BBQ sauces but that was all. Nothing was special and nothing stood out. I think they can do a better job with their wait staff too. It seemed like they were couple managers on duty too but they were just being food runners and not really being managers ( hence we never saw our server after we received our food and we had to wait a long time before ordering)   Improvement needed!",

In regards to the food.... I ordered a half rack of ribs with a side of Mac and cheese.  And then I ordered one additional side of the collard greens.  A half of rack with one side was $14.  I would think that for a rib plate...it would automatically come with two sides.  My husband ordered a pulled pork plate with the jalapeno grits and Mac and cheese.  After trying my ribs and my husband's pulled pork, I ended up trading with him.  The pulled pork was better than the ribs.  The ribs wasnt as tender as Midwood.  But the pulled pork was really good.  I paired the pulled pork with the Queen Bee sauce since its a sweet BBQ sauce.   But what I really loved was the mac and cheese.  It was very cheesy and I could tell that they used cheddar cheese to make it.  The collard greens were good, although once you get to the bottom....it drowned in vinegar.  The jalapeno cheese grits was good too... Even though it wasn't as thick as I'm use to.  Nevertheless, it was still good.    Prior to ordering our entrees, we had the southern egg rolls.  There was only one thing missing....these rolls does not include meat.  If they were to put pull pork in their rolls, then it would have been better.  But I won't complain because it was still good and it was a free appetizer.  If you download their stealz app, they give you the appetizer for free.  So that was nice.  Overall, I liked this place for their pulled pork and Mac and cheese. I will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Similar to baseball i like to give a restaurant three trys before finally making a decision wether i like the place or not. The first two times we came we had the same server. She was great. Attentive, fast and clearly knew the menu.  This was not the case with our server today. After we ordered food, our server didnt return to the table until our food was up. Which usually is fine but our food took so long that i was sipping on melted ice by then. I then had to ask for more soda. After that our server stood in plain sight talking with some other servers until Ann(the server we had the first two times) came up and cleared our table and asked jill our actually server to get our bill together.  As far as food goes some things are good and others are eh... The salmon i had last time was cook perfectly and seasoned well. The collards i didnt care for but they're vegetarian. I dont think ive ever had vegetarian collards before. The little corn muffin was terrible. This go round i got the half chicken. Was a hair on the dry side but was good. Little extra bbq sauce fixed that. The jalapeno grits were amazing! Pasta salad was very bland. I mixed the pickled onion into it with a little salt and pepper. Made it so much better. As far as bang for your buck goes. Its pretty average i seen alot of reviews saying the portions were small for the price. That was my first impression but after almost cleaning my plate i was full.  I may give this place one last shot...",

I have been to The Improper Pig a couple times for taco Tuesday and when they reopen mid August I highly recommend it.  Today I had the pork plate with the baked beans and Asian slaw.  The pork was very good. Nice smoke flavor yummy bits of bark. They have several sauces and I used the queen bee and Thai one today. The queen bee is a little sweet but probably my favorite.  The Asian slaw is the best! Fresh crisp veggies and a salty sweet sauce.  The beans were tasty with little bits of pork but not my favorite...  Service here is always good. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable and make good recommendations.  They said the new location is a standalone building with a courtyard and lots of outdoor seating. It's a lot closer to my home so I am looking forward to the opening",

    "text": "Not sure what has happened to this place, but I don't think we'll ever be going back. We used to enjoy the food and service here, but they've clearly stopped caring about the quality of their overall product. My wife, daughter and I went in for dinner and were seated at a table immediately. The restaurant couldn't have been more than half full on a Saturday night, yet we didn't have a drink order taken for 15 minutes. Drinks then took another five minutes to arrive. We placed an appetizer order, and the server showed up with it 20 minutes later. At that point we placed our dinner order and it took at least another 40 minutes. During this time my wife didn't receive any refills, I received one, my daughter received none. We may have seen the server three times the entire night.   At one point we asked for extra plates and napkins so we could cut up my daughter's food and clean her up. They never came. I had to get up and go back towards the server station and ask for both.  When the food arrived, it was terrible. I ordered the special fried rice with pulled pork. No joke, there was one small thumb-sized \"nugget\" of pork in the entire dish. Not even worth picking at, so I pushed it aside. However; what really fired me up was my daughter's meal was cold. I got her pork sliders and they were cold, and apparently took 30 minutes to make. Great, thanks. Really appreciate waiting forever for my toddler's dinner and then having it come out cold.   My wife got the Chow Bao Taco with pork and said it was cold, seemed smaller than what it's been in the past, and the bun was dry.   A manager came by and offered a 20% coupon due to the long wait for just about everything. Did I mention that large parties of 8+ were sat after us and received far more attentive and prompt service than we did? Well that's exactly what happened. They got their food, drinks, refills, extra napkins etc. as if they were a table of three. We, on the other hand, were forgotten and received a 20% coupon for our next visit as if I would ever want to return after this one.  My dinner was removed from our bill because it wasn't good and I didn't eat it, but that's a weird thing to compliment a restaurant on.   I paid the bill, we left, and that'll be it. Real bummer this place has fallen off so badly.",

    "text": "Wrote a lengthy review on trip advisor. To summarize I would say the food was inedible and smelled vile, the servers hung in the back and chatted but didn't do anything, the cook was doing nothing but hanging around. Our food was served 35 minutes after order. My burger was almost 2 cups of arugula and 1.5 cups of soaking wet pickled vinegar onions with a disgusting piece of meat, one tiny piece of bacon, and no apparent cheese. Check the Belly burger ingredients on the menu to see how wrong this was. My husband's ribs were tiny and burnt dry. His cole slaw was obviously bottom of the jar.   So this being 2 hours before closing the staff decided to snark the paying customer with gross, left over garbage from the days service and all were uninterested or actively enjoying their actions. The bartender who seemed to be the only one working wasn't interested in what the others were doing and offered us half then when she saw how revolting the food was she gave us a meal ticket and a few ridiculous comments on how this only happened to us once?!?  This restaurant is on its way down hill. I guess they squeezed the local customer and are now focusing on their new restaurants. Stay away. Charlotte has so many amazing places to eat and this place is foul and wants you to pay them for food dug back out of the chick bin.",

By the time I got our of the appointment, it was 5:00 pm and I had no desire to  battle the traffic back to the lake at that time of day Figured I would go ahead and have dinner in the area and wait for the traffic to die down.    One of the places I've wanted to try for some period of time is The Improper Pig. Known about them for years but never was in the area where their restaurants are at meal time and besides, my wife is normally with me and she is not a BBQ fan in general  That's what you get marrying a Yankee.  She was not with me today so I had a free shot at it. Her loss my gain.  Got there a few minutes after 5:00 and walked right in. My Doctor's Office and the Improper Pig are both in the Cotswold area and less than a mile apart so it was easy.  Promptly seated and presented menus and they took my order for Unsweetened Tea.  I had already looked at them menu on line and it's pretty comprehensive with something for everyone.  I chose the Cotswold Burger which starts out as a very large Angus Patty that has been treated with a house dry rub, topped with cheese and cooked to order and in the end, topped with 3 oz of Pulled Port and Cole Slaw.  Chose the house chips as my side.  While I waited, I took a close look at the restaurant. Very modern and tastefully appointed, well lit and very comfortable.  The music they were playing was Reggae which I enjoy but have not heard in some time.  The staff is great and they were constantly checking on me to make sure that my every need was taken care of.  Meal came out in a bit and the Sandwich by appearance was impressive and I kept wondering how I was going to eat the whole thing.  The Chips were some of the best Chips I have had in a long time.  The Burger was excellent with interesting contrast it taste and texture due to the dry rub and the pulled pork.  Only downside was the Cole Slaw but that is because I am not a fan of Cole Slaw and here in North Carolina, they put it one just about anything.  To me, it makes the sandwich too wet and add little else to the item.  I ordered Medium Rare and it came out Medium Rare and was an excellent blend of meat with just enough fat to give that extra flavor we all love.  These people know what they are doing and next time, I'm going to bring my wife even if she does not like BBQ.  They had enough items on the menu that are not BBQ that she will enjoy.  Thanks to the folks at The Improper Pig for a great dinner and while I did kill an hour there, traffic was still a bear going back to Lake Norman.",

My favorite is the Swasian (spicy sweet potato), Big KaTuna (be careful it has wasabi), and for a meat option my husband likes The Oinker. Although the presentation is excellent, we did wait approx 30 minutes for our tacos both times we visited.   There is a variety of seating options both booth, table, and outside. We enjoy sitting at the bar because it's intimate and has two TVs to enjoy sports while dining. They have daily drink specials and the beer options are good.... they had my fav Southern Tier beer so I was happy . Can't wait to continue visiting!",

The pulled pork and brisket ($4) (Cotswold Platter $14) had no taste and had to be drowned in their 6 choices of sauces that ranged from vinegar mustard to spicy hoisin with Queen Bee on the top as sweet bbq. The spicy green beans and mac and cheese ($1 extra per gourmet side) were decent but forgettable. And to pay $4 more for 3 thin slabs of brisket... I was appalled. Stay away from the roasted brussel sprouts ($4), though I'd call it nouveau with cranberries and bacon, they honestly were mush and more like steamed then lightly stir fried together.  The pork roll ($4.50) was highway robbery. One deep fried egg roll with some pulled pork and two dipping sauces. The onion rings ($5.95) had an interesting bite. Chewy and crispy at the same time with a nice ranch dip.  Fantastic service. I noticed other guests felt that it was slow or they seemed to be forgotten but I was okay taking my time.",

Weather they have gone down hill with the added interest or what but it was not good at all!  We got the PROPER CHARCUTERIE.  First the BBQ & Brisket had no smoke-ring to it, very dry!  The ribs were almost burned they were so overcooked.  The small corn muffin tasted like the ones you add water too- so no flavor and cold?  Kids got the BBQ sliders, same reaction to the BBQ.  The Mac and Cheese was good but room temp as well.  We got the icecream sandwiches to share which were really good but took them over 30 minutes to get them to us.  Let's talk terrible service!  It was horrible!  The server never asked for additional drinks so apparently one beer and one water are your allotted amounts.  It took forever for get everything!  They were busy but not that busy!  Plus its BBQ not like your making something from scratch, your putting it on a plate!  It took us over 2 hours to eat dinner at a BBQ place!  What????  Don't waste your time!  Don't watch that show and think it would be fun to go there!  Take my advise and save your money!",

It was so much food that I couldn't finish it but a great value for 20.00.   Now let's talk cocktails...i had the SMASH and GRAB which was amazing made with Larceny bourbon. Defiantly hit the spot.   Their cobbler of the month was a strawberry cobbler which was so yummy and topped with icecream. The crust was really good and the strawberries were fresh and plump.

    "text": "Way back in the day I came to a Yelp event for their grand opening - it was awesome - they really blew the roof off with that party! Having a BBQ flashback now...  Since then, I've eaten here twice and once at the Oinker (their food truck). Why no review? Old age maybe? Well it's time I sang their praises, and sing them I will.  The entire staff here is about enjoyment - they want you to enjoy everything and spread the love; if something's not right, they make it right. They've also done such a good job with decorating that you totally forget you're in a strip mall when you go inside.  I had one of the amazing Mango Margarita specials - Mason jar sized, cold, smooth, heavenly, fruity and \"sneak up on you\" strong!  I tackled the Cotswald Plate - your choice of meat and two sides. The only difference between this and the platter is an additional meat. The presentation is a work of art. The tray and parchment paper are the canvas and all that smoky meaty goodness is the paint. The BBQ here is top notch and the sides, oh, the sides. The collards and baked beans were out of this world. These guys know how to season things so well you'll never touch a salt or pepper shaker. The beet salad had a really nice contrast between the peppery flavor of the arugula and the roasted earthiness of the beets and squash. Add some pumpkin seeds and Dijon vinaigrette and it's magical.  BTW did you know Mr. Fieri shot a DDD episode here? He sure did! I wonder if he fantasizes about smoked and grilled meat as much as I do???",

    "text": "I was initially introduced to The Improper Pig about a year ago at an awesome Yelp event. They served delicious Pork Belly. I made all the promises that I would make it out to this location and definitely get to know the menu. Of course that did not happen. However I finally made it. My foodie boss and I ventured to the Cotswold side of town and I finally made it to their patio.   My boss is a native North Carolinian and she loves her Pork BBQ- so naturally we ordered the lunch plate portion of BBQ and sides... and that is where we went wrong. Now don't get me wrong. The Improper Pig has great food I'm sure and they definitely have delicious BBQ sauces.. but wow.. we weren't prepared for the underwhelming Pork BBQ.   The BBQ was bland... it did not seem to have any seasoning.. definitely not the type of seasoning I have come to expect with southern Pork BBQ. The meat it self was light in color and texture, was missing burnt/ crisp edges or ends and was overall under seasoned. I decided to use the BBQ they provided with came with an intense amount of seasonings- I think it was the Eastern style ( I could be mistaken). The sauce added some flavor.. but not the right kind and definitely not in the right way.   Sides. The sides were no better. Actually they were worst. Anyone who enjoys a good BBQ knows that the sides can be the best part of the meal. We had Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens.... I hear the Greens were good... but the Mac ... Yikes.. Reminded me of missteps in late night Kraft Mac in the dorm. :( It seemed to be an off day, or the mac is made with some weird powder mixture cheese...   On a good note... Wonderfully positive note. - I sometimes can have an upset tummy from eating to much BBQ Pork.. - No tummy ache after I left here.",

    "text": "One of my favorite go-tos whenever the team is feeling like a BBQ lunch. The food, flavor and sauces and always consistent and delicious. There is a sight Asian fusion/twist to the mix, but I have to say it blends perfectly! I usually do the bbq plate with pulled chicken and get either brussel sprouts or Mac and cheese and sweet potato waffle fries on the side. They always have an Asian fusion specialty item on the specials menu like a fried rice or one time I got something like a pad Thai with pulled chicken? It was probably one of the best fusion dishes I've ever had! Sadly, it was a limited item but the noddles went perfectly with the BBQ flavor and sauces! I also really love the improper nachos! The base is house-made chips with various toppings and you choose a protein (pulled pork, chicken, brisket). Definitely a must try! There are 6 difference sauces but my favorites are the Queen Bee, Mary B's and Thai. I always drench whatever I get in a mix of these sauces because they're so delicious! I have a great experience every time here and will definitely be back!  P.S. Check out their happy hour! There are a coup of items that are 50% off and I believe it's $2 tacos!",

I had the Bourbon Blackberry Tea, it was awesome, strong but not overwhelming and the muddled blackberries at the bottom . Boyfriend had the OMB Copper beer. But every time we ordered anything.. another 10 minutes. The girl told us they were short a server but we counted about 10 servers it wasn't even super busy so we were a little irritated. Maybe she was new? I had the Chow Bao taco with brisket. It was super tasty, delicious tender meat and Mary B's BBQ sauce is the bomb! It's a little unfortunate that the service was so bad bc the food was great! We'll be back but hopefully they'll figure the server situation out",

I've had better and I've had worse. In general, I think Charlotte has a huge void of REALLY good BBQ spots, but I digress.   Where Improper Pig really shines is with their Asian fusion specials! Be it Pad Thai, Spicy Basil, Fried Rice, etc. I love it all! The Asian flavors mixed with the smoked meats just can't be beat. The Chow Bao Taco, which is on their menu full time, is also delish. And, I could eat buckets full of those spicy green beans.   We like sitting at the bar ($4 Charlotte drafts on Sundays!) where they have a couple big TVs to watch whatever big game may be on. Their beer selection is decent. They always have at least 4 or 5 good local selections on draft.   Service is always attentive and friendly. And, to top it all off, we can usually find a Groupon or coupon to save us a few bucks.",

I went with the pulled chicken chow bao taco which was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and is basically a BBQ sandwich in a steamed bao bun with Asian slaw and spicy hoisin (this was a little too spicy for my tastes but was balanced by adding one of the sweeter sauces on the table). The menu also conveniently notes which items are vegan, gluten free and vegetarian - surprising a lot for a BBQ place. The veggie options looked so good that I almost went with the \"no pig\" grilled portobello sandwich. Next time. We sat on the outside patio and I will say that the ambience was not great. You're overlooking a strip mall parking lot. And we had to move away from the edge of the patio because the wind shifted and brought with it a sewery smell. But other than that, a great lunch.",

I got very bored of Subway, Panera and Dairy Queen (hey, they do serve actual food...).   My first visit to The Improper Pig was for a quick dinner with a friend. We were seated quickly and approached by a friendly server within minutes. I got a peach flavored margarita which was delicious and fairly priced. Both my friend and I chose the Cotswold Plate with the chicken option. The food came out quickly, and honestly, I don't think I could have devoured my meal any quicker.  The chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. Our server went over all of the barbecue sauce options that accompany the table. It was a very informative mini-BBQ sauce lesson (region, sauce taste, ingredients) which I appreciated! Each one that I tried went extremely well with the chicken.  Each plate comes with a small portion of pickled onions which I enjoyed. I wish that there was a bigger helping of cornbread, but alas, it hit the spot. My two side options were the sweet potato hash, and BY FAR, the star of my meal... jalapeno cheese grits.   You know those food items that make your mouth water at the simple thought of the dish? That's the jalapeno cheese grits for me. The grits were a perfect texture - not too thick, not too runny. The creamy taste of the cheese and the pop of the jalapeno sent my taste buds to heaven. I literally licked the spoon they were so good. I could eat those grits every day for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Don't get me wrong, the sweet potato hash was amazing too, but definitely was out shined by the grits.  Overall - great ambiance and customer service. Amazing food for the price. I am a huge fan of this establishment and can't wait to go back for more!",

We split the Improper Charcuterie board and it was fantastic! The pimento cheese that comes with it.... um hellllooo?! Where have I been?

    "text": "Boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time and were very disappointed. Between our two orders, we tried the pork, smoked chicken, collard greens, Mac n cheese, baked beans and jalapeno cheese grits. The pork was decent, nothing special. The chicken was awful. Not only was it kissing a smoked flavor, it was dry. So dry, I could barely swallow it with dousing it in sauce. I guess someone who likes a lot of vinegar in their collards might like them, but I thought they just tasted strange. The mac n cheese was very cheesy but very bland. I did not like at all. The baked beans were sweet, in a strange syrupy liquid unlike any baked bean  I have ever tried. Finally, the guys had a mild jalapeno flavor but again nothing impressive. Def not worthy of the overall 4 stars on Yelp.",

The meat on our burgers was very good and cooked to our desired level of doneness. However, my \"smoke house\" burger had almost no smokiness. Additionally, the house-made salt and vinegar chips almost surely had no vinegar (but they were house made). With some more focus on flavors, this would be a very good burger place but it fell a bit short in my eyes.",

I was a bit skeptical going in, and the waitress told us the specials and the \"Belly Burger\" was one of them and sounded interesting, 70% beef 30% pork and had blue cheese crumbles with a tangy BBQ sauce (I believe it was Mary B's BBQ sauce but not sure because the special is not on the menu), bacon on top of that and homemade chips on the side.  I thought it was one of the best burgers I have ever had!!  Wife got the Pulled Pork plate and shared with our daughter and mixed a couple sauces that she liked and it was really good too.    Server was very friendly and answered our questions and was pretty busy so a slight wait on getting drinks filled but not her fault, it is a crowded place at lunch time.  We loved the ambiance of the place too, kind of a strange fusion between asian and BBQ but it works!  Looking forward to trying some other things, I noticed a lot of nice things said about the egg roll appetizers.    Only suggestion would be to put that Belly Burger special on the menu!!",

The place was packed but we luckily got a seat within 5 minutes!  The one disappointment that we had was that it took 15 minutes for anyone to recognize that we had not been waited on, yet. At this point, we were all hungry and thirsty (as we did not have waters, not were we able to place our adult beverage orders). There was a waitress, however, that had walked by and noticed we had not been waited on and immediately stopped to take our order and wait on us (mind you she was actually supposed to be leaving or the night, but stayed to wait on us, which I thoroughly commend her for doing this and appreciate it most graciously!)  Upon ordering our drinks, our apps, and our entrees we were very pleased with the service, the drinks, and the food! The Improper Nachos (with Brisket added) were absolutely PHENOMENAL! We ate them very quickly. During eating the Improper Nachos, the manager had made his way over (as our wonderful waitress had explained to him that we had been forgotten) and he promptly and happily comped the Nachos for us.   The entrees were delicious and we all definitely enjoyed ourselves!  I most DEFINITELY and HIGHLY recommend the Improper Pig, wonderful staff and wonderful food/barbecue! I will absolutely be returning!",

I can't even put my finger on what was wrong with it but it wasn't tasty at all. My husband had the sweet potato hash and I thought that was very good, he didn't like it.

    "text": "WARNING: if you're a bbq purist especially of the NC variety do not come here only to complain that is not what you receive.  The name says it all, it is improper unconventional bbq and totally awesome! The ambiance is modern casual, neat decor, and pleasant vibe.  As soon as you walk up you can smell that wood burning smoker which is the only way to legitimize yourself as a good BBQ spot in my eyes. They also had a really good draft selection with an emphasis on local brews which is always worth bonus points with me!  Pricing for the brews was avg to pricey depending on the brew, and the bar looked like a neat area to grab a brew and some apps after work.  To find your first unconventional aspect all you have to do is read the apps menu, you'll find edamame and bbq kale chips, first clue purists! But rest assured I ordered both and both exceeded my expectations.  Kale chips well seasoned and had a little kick of spice at the end, it was actually to spicy for my wife but she is kind of a baby in regards to heat.  For dinner I ordered the pulled pork which I typically will use as a basis for conclusion on a BBQ spot, but I did temper expectations as I said the improper aspect was expected to come into play.  Having said, it was awesome, traditional flavor of unsauced meats, moist succulent, light smoke flavor, good mix of bark.  I got the collards and Brussel sprouts as my side, both were very good but nothing to go out of the way to elaborate, if you like those things you'll like these.  I really liked the cornbread \"cookie\" that it came with, it wasn't huge but stop being a gluttonous douche, the portion size of food is fair enough.  My wife got the pulled chicken which was also very good and an act side of Mac and cheese and a very good sweet potato hash.  The choice of sauces is very good they have the normal western/eastern NC sauces as well as SC mustard.  The best I thought carried heavy Asian influence with a spicy hoisin and a sweet chili sauce.  If you really like heat ask for a side of inferno, my server let me in on this secret!  It will not be found on the tables and be cautious it is a slow deep burn, non inedible but you don't need much!   I also really enjoyed the \"plating\" of the food served on metal trays and a side of pickled slaw I'm guessing, I really liked flavor contrast of the pickled slaw with the meat.   I will be back soon with more to report (I definitely have my eye on those improper nachos) but in the meantime do your tummy a flavor and get there now!",

I ordered the Cotswald plate with smoked chicken and a side of slaw and sweet potato hash. I loved the variety of sauces which I enjoyed for the Asian influence since I am not really feeling the Carolina mustard style (I am not a native Carolinian to be fair :-). My favorite sauce was the hoisin with the Tongs Thai coming in a close second.   Overall the food was excellent. I will be back again because there are several other items on the menu I would love to try including the improper charcuterie as well as the ribs and other sauces.  not to mention the chocolate pie with bacon was awesome .. and not part of my healthy lifestyle but.. never the less Awesome!!",

It's a great fusion blend of Korean and Southern food. The decor is really cool, it's industrial while still feeling cozy.   Our server was great.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and laid back.  We tried the onion rings with ranch dip for an appetizer.  They were hot, fresh, and crunchy, but nothing extraordinary.   For entrees, I got the bao bun taco with chicken as my meat, and a side of baked beans.  My fiancee got the pimento grilled cheese with smoked tomato and bacon, and Mac and cheese on the side.  They were both fantastic.  My chicken was tender, moist, and topped with a delicious hoison bbq sauce (if they make that in house, they need to bottle it, and sell it!)  I'm not a fan of southern slaw, but this Asian slaw was amazing.  It had a great ratio of cilantro in it, and I believe I tasted a lime/vinegar mix. The beans were delicious, and I was excited that they used an assortment of beans to make it.  His pimento grilled cheese was melt in your mouth goodness.  The Mac and cheese was True perfection, because it was actually made with real cheese versus the Velveeta crap tjhat most restaurants around here use.  We share a peanut butter cookie with chocolate ice cream sandwich for dessert.  It was spectacular and decadent.  My only thought was it was big enough for 4, so we ended up wasting about half.   We will definitely be back.  This place was delicious!",

My wife is usually meh on grits but would like a take home bucket of these!  The pork BBQ is delicious, the platter served on allows for multiple sauces to be tried.  The pickled onions are great for clearing he palette between tastes.   Pace yourself and be sure to get the blackberry cobbler, its sinful without being overly sweet.

    "text": "Like many people in Charlotte we saw the Improper Pig on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and decided to check them out.  It was only a few minutes from us and in a strip mall, which meant plenty of parking.  The outdoor seating was full on a beautiful day for lunch and we had just a short wait for indoor seating.  Service was friendly and quick.  Everything on the menu sounded good and they noted those items shown on the show, but so many other things were great options.  My wife got the chow boa taco and I got the Cotswold platter with chicken and brisket.  We started with an appetizer of chorizo/cheese stuffed grilled jalepenos.  Tasty!  My food arrived and I was surprised at the large portions.  I selected the jalepenos grits me spicy green beans as sides.  All of the food worked well together.  The chicken was so flavorful I barely added any sauce.  The brisket was a little fatty for my tastes, but was good.  I could have eaten a large bowl of the grits by them self.  The beans had a tasty hoisin sauce.  We came because of the show but we will be coming back often because the food was so good.  Everything was amazing!",

Let me say this was a great second 1st impression. We ordered the improper  charcuterie so we could try as many meats at one time. We also ordered the Mac and cheese, grilled asparagus, and spicy green beans. I started the meal out eating the sides first and let me say I could have filled up on the sides alone as a meal. The spicy green were amazing, with additional ingredients like chicken and rice it could be a great dish for the menu. Once we started on the meats there was no disappointment there either, our favorite had to be the ribs. We enjoyed our meals but did not use much of the sauces as they were a little too sweet for our taste, not to say they were bad just not to our liking.   We frequent many BBQ restaurants and we will definitely be back for more.",

But, we got a proper taste test and sampled all their vegetarian fare and it's DELICIOUS. Jess Randall has worked diligently with us throughout this process to put together a menu that meets our budget and our personal taste/dietary preferences. We're super excited about the tofu barbeque we'll be serving, on top of everything else. PLUS, she's helped us to meet some pretty stringent requirements from our venue.  I'll have to update this review after the actual event, but so far we love The Improper Pig more than vegetarians should and we highly recommend them for your catering needs!  UPDATE: Improper Pig really came through for us on the wedding day! Some of our guests had strong opinions about our vegetarian wedding, but when it was all said and done we got nothing but compliments. If you're a vegetarian and don't know if Improper Pig is a good spot for you, I say TRY IT!",

The food exceeded my expectations. It came out hot and with a minimum wait time. I had the half smoked chicken with collards and string beans. The string beans are a must try! They had a nice slightly spicy kick to them.  Even the pickled onions were delicious and I'm definitely not an onion fan. Overall for the food, two thumbs up.   Service was great, everyone was welcoming and did a great job at making sure we were taking care of throughout the meal. Not to mention on the spot with bringing out everything we asked for in a timely fashion.   I'm sure to return, next time trying the BBQ Salmon!!",

I wasn't in love with their creamed corn (the weekly side special), but I'm also not a fan of bell peppers and there was a lot of them in it. (The waitress didn't mention it, or I wouldn't have ordered it.) Their apple cobbler was okay, but it was topped with the smallest scoop of ice cream. Probably won't order it again next time.

    "text": "A friend invited me out to Improper Pig for Saturday dinner. If you're looking for Pork, this is the place to go. After wavering between the salmon and the ribs. I ended up going with the ribs with a side of sweet potato hash. The ribs were well seasoned and fell off of the bone. They really didn't need any sauce. However, I tried each and every one offered. The sauces are Asian inspired, so there was no basic BBQ sauce. Queen Bee - SWEET BBQ; Mary's - taste like ketchup; Tong Tai - spicy sweet vinaigrette; Eastern Vinegar - vinegar w/ a kick; Spicy Hoilson - Spicy Teryaki; Mustard - any other mustard sause. I settled on mixing the Spicy Hoilson (which was best) and Queen Bee. The spicy sauces are VERY spicy, so be prepared.  I didn't like the sweet potato hash. I was expecting something sweet. However, there were onions and maybe garlic mixed in, which eliminated the sweetness and overall I wasn't a fan. Just don't order this expecting something sweet.  My friend had their chocolate cake for dessert, which she like. I had the house margarita, which was the drink of the day. Their house margarita is actually an orange margarita, which my waitress failed to mention. It was okay. While she was patient, she could have been far more informative. Nevertheless, this is a BBQ pork restaurant and based on that, I will judge it. Thus four stars. If you're looking for BBQ, the Improper Pig is the place to go in Charlotte.",

So the place features barbecue with an asian twist and has plenty of options for vegetarians as well like Smoked tofu for your protein.  Everything Vegetarian is marked with a V on the menu.  Good job in pointing it out for us!   The seating is a mix of booths, high top tables, bar seating and a nice outdoor patio.  At the recommendation of our server, I went with the side plate with the choices of brussels sprouts, asian slaw, the veggie of the week and the jalapeno cheese grits.  Normally I am not a grits fan but these were really good!  The other 3 sides were good but not great in my opinion.    Still, I wan to come back here and try the smoked tofu and their other vegetarian options.  I see plenty of promise here!",

The Improper Pig will be one of the places we stop! Hopefully, my server, whose name I think is Jake, will still be there to greet us. He showered me with impeccable service!   I started with the Southern Rolls! Jake warned me that the mustard used for presentation was spicy and im glad he did. That first bite brought tears, got me right in the back of my throat and I loved it! All the way yummy!  I ordered the salmon with collards and black eye pea salad.  The salmon was absolutely divine! It came served with their house pickled onions. Which will allow me to tell you what was absolutely perfection... Take those pickled onions and dump them on top of those collards!!!! I was right back in my grandmother's arms. I swear all was missing was some red koolaid and I would have entered heavens gates, even if it was for a short stay. That flavor combo of the greens and onions left me breathless. A gentleman that I'm almost certain was the manager/ owner must have noticed the hazed gaze that came over my eyes and thought something was ary because he stopped to ask if i was ok? I reassured him that I was better than just ok, just experiencing a moment. I  asked if he could box up some of those onions to take home to enjoy with the rest of my greens? He brought me more than enough. I'm about to make me a pitcher of red koolaid, have a seat in my grandmas vanity chair and revisit her this evening. I seriousky could have eaten a bucket full!! And just so you understand, my grandma didn't play when it came to her greens!  You must go to this spot! Ask for Jake! I pray they won't disappoint. But if it means anything to anyone this place got it ALL right for my visit there!",

    "text": "I came in after talking myself out of bbq the last time nearby. I was greeted by three staff members before even making it to my table. I felt very welcomed. I started with a pork stuffed egg roll. It's not on the menu but was a special today. (YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT, INCREDIBLE!!)  Next, I ordered the Cotswold Plate. brisket with Mac and cheese and Jalapeno grits. SOOOO GOOOD!!! The brisket melts in your mouth. The Mac and cheese could use a little more flavor. It's good but could benefit from more flavor.   For the grand finale, I ordered the ice cream sandwich. I was told that they are made by the owner and his daughter every morning for their bonding time. Too sweet.  Peanut butter cookies with chocolate ice cream in the middle. Yes! Yes! Yes! I recommend this place. Everything was perfect!!!!",

    "text": "9 months ago, I had an amazing review for this place. New staff, new management, new taste, new service...and it all sucks. I've given it 3 chances in hopes that they were having a bad night. But it has gotten nasty. Small portions for a big price. always overlooked. Even the to-go boxes now look like something from Harris Teeter. Everything has been a downgrade. The old bartender was so welcoming and always had amazing service. We had bad service and it was only 3 people in the restaurant. I ordered a bbq sandwich at first but then I didn't have enough pork to cover the bottom bun so I sent it back immediately. Then I got the platter. And the pulled pork was just dry. The pork rolls use to be my favorite but they are very consistent with burning them now and instead of pork rolls, they should be called cheese rolls. Almost no pork in them now for almost $5 for one roll. It's just not the place it use to be. I'd rather go to a fast-food bbq spot before returning here.",

We got the sweet potato egg rolls the pork eggs rolls the pork nachos, I got the side dish, and my boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich. First of all I love the idea of a side dish plate. It was you pick 4 sides and it comes with cornbread. Sometimes that's all I want when I go to BBQ places, so nice touch! the staff was nice, and the atmosphere was cool. Plenty of parking. Definitely try. Plus if your a fan of triple D is a cool stop",

    "text": "Really disappointed with this place!   The burgers were good.  Definitely a premium burger joint, although there are a couple better places in town.  $12 for a burger with no fries is not cool in my book though.   The service was TERRIBLE.  They messed up a burger and didn't seem to care.  When we asked for lettuce on one of them they brought over a plate with a piece of lettuce that was LITERALLY the size of a baseball card.  They ought to be embarrassed of that!  Even after I said \"you have got to be kidding\" they defended the small piece they brought over.    I'll never go back here again and suggest others don't waste their time or money.",

    "text": "Going to the improper pig was ok the meat is seasoned well the smoked meat had great favor but nothing that blows you away. The beans were nothing to write home about and the sweet potato fries were cold, but 2nd second order were much better. I am a lover of brisket however I wasn't in love with one. Honestly it wasn't the worst I've ever had, but on the brisket I'd  give it a 6. Great taste of smoke and nice smoke ring but favor didn't penetrate deep enough for my liking. However the sauces were really complementary to their style of meat.",

    "text": "Came  here after doing some work in Columbia SC. Asked the person at the hotel for some recommendations and mentioned I like bar b que. She came through with a few suggestions including this place. It was a bit of a drive but well worth it. It's in a strip mall right next to a Starbucks. Nice atmosphere, some outside seating (with a view of the parking lot). Got seated right away and served by Tiffany who was really nice. She walked me through some of the specials and when I asked for a taste of one of the  local beers she brought it to me quickly. I had the jalapeno appetizer which was great. Not actually spicy but great flavor. I went big and got the charcuterie platter which has a taste of a bunch of meats. The pulled pork was a little fatty but had great flavor. The brisket and sausage were also good. The ribs were not falling off the bone but had good flavor and that's before adding some of the sauces. I like the spicy hoisen which had a kick (it might blow out your taste buds)  as well as the vinegar based (hey, when in Carolina,) and the tomato based was also good. Nothing prepackaged here. The only regret was that there weren't enough homemade chips to scoop up the yummy pimento cheese. They have a nice drink menu with lots of high end whiskey and other inventive drinks. I'm a beer man so I went with one on tap. Quite good. One other nice note, I was here towards the end of the evening and I watched the staff doing some clean up. It was nice to see people who at least appeared to be enjoying their jobs. Saw a few families here. Nice place and totally worth checking out.",
