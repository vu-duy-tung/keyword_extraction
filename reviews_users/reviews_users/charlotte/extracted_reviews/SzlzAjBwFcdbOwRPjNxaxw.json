    "text": "So, my son and I dined at Miro's Spanish Grille last night, and it was a very underwhelming experience. My son and I both ordered the paella and although the flavor of the sauce was good, the fact that they use frozen shrimp was a real turn off. This seems to be common in Charlotte, as I have been to many higher end restaurants that serve frozen shrimp! Coming from NY, a restaurant like this would not last 6 months. That's not to say you won't find frozen shrimp in a NY restaurant, you will, but it's in a low end restaurant for $9.   So, hoping for a good dessert to take something away from this meal, I ordered the tres leches  cake and it was stale!  Anyway, people of Charlotte, please start demanding fresh seafood when your paying $30 plus for a meal. It's the only way things will change.   PS - the sangria and coffee were good.",

Our food was amazing!  The waiter recommended a Spanish desert he said was really moist so we tried it. Wow! It was so moist we couldn't figure out how it stayed together. It was really good.  After dinner we sat at the bar & the bartender made us Mojitos that were very good. It was a great night.",

All the food is delicious, but it's really all about the paella. You MUST order it -- period. Doesn't matter which one; they're all stellar. Get the octopus appetizer instead of dessert, which is fine, but not worth the calories in my opinion.",

    "text": "If I return, it'll be for the Tres Leches Cake. Now granted, this restaurant isn't horrible, not even close. But I expected a lot more. I made a reservation for 5pm and only had 1 hour to eat before we had to be at an event. It was perfect timing. They have very fast service! We were seated immediately and our server was A+!! There are so many wonderful options on the menu and I wanted to try everything!! I ordered 2 appetizers, the Fried Calamares & Gratinadas; the Churrasco de Cerdo entree (My friend got the Paella Valenciana); and the Tres Leches Cake for dessert. Overall, everything was pretty bland. It wasn't that burst of flavor that I was expecting. Everything needed salt. The calamari was fried but not to a crisp, I was sooo disappointed with this because I order Calamari literally every time I see it on the menu. I love it! But it just was not good here. I did enjoy the Scallops once I put some additional salt on it. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were nice and plump. I could have had that for my entree. My entree was decent, but again, pretty bland. After seeing all of the reviews for the Tres Leches Cake we just had to try that and we are so glad we did. It turned our disappointment of a mediocre meal into a great big smile walking out. Our server even put little designs on the plate. It was hands down the best i've ever tasted.",

It melted on your mouth, and the cake was so tender while the cream decorations were real whipped heavy cream, the cake touched with little flecks of temptations. Yes, we did actually eat a meal :). I had the Salmon topped with a compote of Tomatoes that was flavorful and piquant. It was accompanied by Grilled Veggies. My BFFs also had imaginative and mouth watering entrees. I loved the Malbec. The redecoration of the former 'Brixxs' location includes beautiful dark wood and very private booths as well as an expanded outdoor patio area. A simply wonderful experience!!!",

I feel the new location is even better because (1) parking is much easier, (2) the environment is nicely decorated and (3) the food is still as good or better than ever.    We were nicely greeted upon entry and were seated right away for our reservation.  I noticed how the high ceilings and the new wall decor adds a great touch to the ambiance.  The service was first-class, the food was fresh & hot, and we all had a wonderful experience the whole time there.  We tried a little of everything on the menu - appetizers, main entrees and desserts - and it was all fantastic.  Their Tres Leches dessert could possibly be the best dessert in town!    We'll definitely be back and highly recommend Miro Spanish Grille to anyone looking for a wonderful and pleasant dining experience!",

We would ask our server for something and immediately another server would bring it to the table. We had the empanadas and fried calamari for appetizers. Then we had the soup version of paella (description right from the server's mouth) and osso buco, which is veal on potatoes. It was delicious. The sangria here is also very nice. For dessert, I ordered the tres leches and I must say this place has top five tres leches I've ever had (take it from a tres leches aficionado). Great restaurant, I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I used to go to Miro's sporadically when it was at it's old location.  The new place is closer to where I live so when asked for a suggestion for a place to eat on a Friday night I suggested we go here.  I was a HUGE fan of Eddies Place (RIP) and never went to Brig's.  We made a 6:30 reservation and was seated right away to a booth for 4.  They did a nice job on the decor which is modern, a bit dark but trendy.  Our waiter Juan Carlos took very good care to explain the menu and make some great suggestions.  We started out with the mussels, and shrimp which both item has some extremely flavorful broth for dipping.  We had to keep asking poor Juan Carlos to bring us more bread since we kept running our because of all the sopping going on.  I come from a long line of soppers and Miros provided the perfect dishes to continue my family tradition.  Anyhoo, I ordered the lamb because, I love lamb and most restaurants in Charlotte don't offer it.  It was served with some carrots and mashed potatoes which didn't get paid much attention to because the lamb was so delicious.  Slowly braised. tender and seasoned well I went full on Fred Flintstone on it when I first apologized to the other patrons when I picked the bone up and ate every last morsel of lamby goodness.  For dessert we had what else, but the Tres Leche.  Just as wonderful as I remembered it.  The Manager or Owner came by and greeted us and thanked us for coming as the restaurant slowly filled up which is always a nice touch.  I am glad Miro's reopened and will definitely return.",

If you never get out of Ballantyne then maybe this will work for you. There's similar places way better than this, and the ones I know of locally are within 2 miles of uptown. This has nothing to do with my review but the music was all over the place from song to song and I felt rushed after I ate and it's most likely because it was a few minutes after 2pm.",

We love the food here, we walked in on a Sunday that happened to be Mother's Day with a very upset and angry 4 year old. A very nice lady whom I believe is the manager? I didn't get her name but she was soooo incredibly sweet and understanding. She talked to my daughter and treated her to a strawberry daiquiri that made her feel so much better. Such a nice gesture of her, and as I stated previously, the food was amazing.",

Our waitress Femia was excellent. I had the seafood paella (\"small\" size - more than enough for one person) and my wife had the grilled salmon. Both were cooked to perfection and very tasty. We had the empanadas for appetizer, which were also very good.  Prices are very reasonable. Great experience, we are definitely coming back!..",

    "text": "I was sooooo excited to try this place. I've been craving paella for the longest time and since the reviews for this place was great, we decided to come in to try for dinner. We made a reservation and waited an extra 30 minutes. It's okay, I understand if things back up. At least they had plenty of room to sit while waiting for your table.  We ordered the calamari, gazpacho, pork tenderloin, and the paella. The appetizers were great and the gazpacho was really refreshing! The pork tenderloin was my dad's favorite and was very flavorful. Then the paella came. The paella was colorful and there was an abundant of seafood (looking good). When I dug in, there was no char on the bottom. This is where I was disappointed. To me, it was more of a pilaf than a paella. It was just rice with sauce. Hopefully this was just an off night but on the bright side, at least the seafood was fresh?  Overall, I do not think I will be returning to Miro. For a Spanish restaurant to take pride in their paella (and have it fall flat), it's hard to see myself eating it again.",

    "text": "Miro has been one of my wife's and my favorite South Charlotte restaurants for the past 15 years. We have enjoyed both its old location at Stonecrest and its new location at Toringdon (even more.) Its owner Tri is normally onsite checking on customers which is always a huge plus and a good sign. The atmosphere is comfortable and polished.   I must say upfront that, although service is usually friendly and attentive, it can be spotty at times as some of its servers can be quite temperamental and rude. Ask the manager directly for another if you are not happy with yours. In fact, do this anywhere! You are the customer, for goodness sake, and eating out is expensive, expect and demand good service!   I'm going to do something that I normally I do not do, which is to start with dessert. Their Tres Leches cake is quite frankly the best we've had anywhere! It is made in house and easily serves two. It is incredibly moist and is made perfectly. The only problem is it spoils you for anywhere else.   Over the years, we have tried everything on the menu; our favorite however, the Red Snapper, is not on the menu. When it is available as a special we definitely choose it. Of course as you may expect at a Spanish Grille, the paella and Zarzuela, which is like paella stew, are both excellent.   My go to dish is the Churrasco de Cerdo which is the grilled seasoned pork tenderloin topped with chimichurri sauce, served with Spanish rice, black beans, and plantains for $17. The pork is always tender and flavorful and the sides, especially the plantains, are perfectly prepared. You also can't go wrong with any of the tapas.  All meals are served with bread - soft and warm mini loaves - and if that is fabulous with butter. We always order a house salad with the house vinaigrette and have consistently been pleased.   Even after all these years, this place remains a Gotta Try. It stays busy though though, if you're going to dinner, be sure to make reservations.",

Miro is a restaurant that we always go to with our huge family of 14 - big groups can be a hassle in most restaurants, but Miro always takes care of us and assigns more than one server. With big groups, definitely get the appetizer sampler platter. It's not on the menu but it's perfect for our family! It comes with jamon & cheese, empanadas, calamari, steak, and a few other goodies :) We love their paella and the nightly specials are always so delicious! Can't forget to finish off your meal with the best tres leches in town either :)",

    "text": "One of the worst services I have ever had! First time I went to this restaurant I ordered to go and the service was not the best but I assumed they were busy. Second time I came... I came in a hour and a half before the place closed to place an order to go. Two men were at the bar counting money and I waited for about 18 minutes. I tried to be patient because I understand when you work at a register and money needs to be counted however customer service should come first. Neither one of them acknowledged me. They kept counting even though they could have at least said \"give us one moment mam! I'll be right with you!\" A group of women came in and they laughed with them and struck up a conversation. After waiting for over 18 minutes even though it seemed longer the tall ball headed man at the bar finally acknowledged me. I had issues deciding what I wanted and he walked away from me to go do something else. He seemed very impatient and wasn't willing to help due to the menu was slightly confusing because the food consists of Spanish dishes. He came back again and told to me to hold on a second. Spoke with a lady and came back to me and said \"The kitchen is closed!\" I stated I had been waiting for over 15-20 minutes and they still had an hour before they closed. He was very nonchalant and not very apologetic at all. I have worked in customer service for over 15 years and I have never experienced such rudeness. When I stated I wouldn't be coming back he shrugged his shoulders and said \"okay then\".... very rude man! I will never eat at this restaurant ever and I will make sure to tell everyone I know! As long as they have the tall ball headed/very short cut guy at the bar working there I will never ever eat there!!! He is extremely rude, seems a little racist, and seems to only want to assist \"certain\" customers based on their appearance. One thing I've learned through my years of customer service is that you never know how much money a person may have even the customers in sweatpants and a t-shirt, but never forget that the customers are the ones who make sure you get a check. If we don't eat there you don't get paid! He needs to be humbled! Be blessed.",

We had a 7:15 reservation and showed up about 10 minutes early.  We were greeted warmly and told to take a seat while they got our table ready.  It was just a few minutes of waiting before we were taken to our table just minutes prior to our actual reservation time.  The restaurant is small, but very modern and comfortable inside.  Our waiter was not overly friendly, but attentive at the right times and very efficient.  As for the food, everything we tried was wonderful!  We got the calamari for an appetizer and they were able to do half fried and half grilled, very tasty.  Each of us then got a salad which were both good, but the entrees are what stole the show.  I got the seafood stew and it was so good!  Loaded with calamari, shrimp, scallops, fish and half a lobster tail, and the sauce!  YUM!  My husband got the beef short ribs and also very much enjoyed his meal. I wish I had saved room for dessert because that dessert tray that caught my eye looked fabulous!  I will for sure being having dessert next time we go back.  I would recommend this restaurant or a date night, family or friends to go meet up.",

Once again I fell for a description that was probably accurate but not as expected. I had a nice piece of  grilled halibut that was topped with crushed tomatoes and two small 1/8\" thick slices of andouille sausage. Could hardly notice them on my plate. Considering I fell for the fish/sausage combination description, I was disappointed. Flavor was good and service was great. That's twice now the specials have let me down though.",

We had a drink and tapas in the bar and the bar tenders were the most friendly and fun we've met in some time.  I would recommend it as a place for drinks anytime.    But - the food was under/ over cooked and cold in places.   It really was 'blow the kitchen up and start over' bad.   Something must have happened for this place to become popular.  It must have been good at one time but is no more.  All three of the dishes we tried were exceptionally bad.   We love authentic Spanish dishes and were really hoping we had found a great spot - but Outside of stopping for drinks, I'd pass it on by.",

They do whatever they can to make your special occasion really special, when you note it on the reservation. It gets pretty busy so make one or be prepared to wait. I've had a lot of their dishes but my favorite are probably the croquets, the paella, and the seafood stew(z- something). Their seafood always tastes fresh, their rice is cooked perfectly every time, they really do a good job of being authentic. The tres leches cake is to die for btw.",

You won't be disappointed, their chimichurri sauce is spectacular!",

The traditional paella comes with shrimp, mussels, clams, and squid. My mother had her paella customized to just chicken, (because she hates seafood) and she was very pleased. Someone from my table had the fideos, and he really loved the dish because it had more sauce than the traditional paella. The service was ok, which is why I took one star off. For example, there was only ONE waitress trying to do everything and she was quite pushy. I can totally overlook this though with the wonderful food! We ended our meal with a slice of tres leches cake (which was complimentary for the birthday girl) and it was absolutely divine! But, we did wait for about 15 minutes for our check to arrive and when it did, we had to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes for them to give back the card. Overall, Miro's food is amazing but the service/staff....eh not so much!",

I started with Gambas a Criolla, served with 2 soft rolls intended for the garlic dressing.  I had the rack of lamb which was perfectly prepared.  It came on a bed of mashed potatoes with a delightfully tangy Chimichurri dressing.  I finished with a flour-less chocolate cake which was great with my red Rioja.  Super experience.",

The seating is comfortable and the service is outstanding!  For this visit, my dinner group met to explore the flavors of Spain. Some of us started out with the Sangria which was delicious. For my meal, I ordered the gazpacho and the Paella de Carne. Everything was beautifully presented.   The gazpacho was flavorful but a tad bit too salty. The paella was a great alternative to the traditional seafood paella and came chicken, lamb, chorizo and a cut of beef topped with chimichurri in the middle of a large dish of Spanish rice. It was enough food for 3 people and all of us who ordered it ended up taking some home.  For desert, I ordered the Flan but they have about 10 different desserts available if you save room for it! The flan was light and delightful and mildly sweet.   Wonderful place but it gets busy. If you are going with a group, make sure to make a reservation a few days in advance!",

It took them a good 20 minutes to bring out the dessert tray for us to select...food is 5 star, but service could be faster.   I would recommend coming here with a big group so you can try every single tapa on their menu. My favorites are the manchego cheese, shrimp, potatoes, and the calamari. I have been to Spain multiple times and have tried many different tapas, and Miro does not disappoint. The flavor is on top, not too oily or salty, with the right amount of spices and seasoning that brings back memory of my travels to Spain.   They also have great wine selection to go with the food as well.   Also great dessert - although their flan could be better. It didn't stand out and tasted the same as any other flan I could buy.",

    "text": "Again, Yelp has helped me select a winner for my dinner evening. This particular Tuesday night at Miro, the restaurant was mostly empty other than about 6 dinner guests and a few at the bar. I always prefer a plethora of seats to choose from on a less occupied night, than being wedged in somewhere less desirable on a packed night.  Our server was friendly, and made knowledgeable recommendations about the menu. For our appetizers, we ordered Langostinos a Pil Pil, which are plump shrimp tossed in a spicy garlic sauce. There were four in a bowl, which is just right because the entrees would be filling. I certainly wouldn't have minded eating 10 of these babies- it was pretty good. Second appetizer was the baked Parmesan scallops, which our server pointed out was a customer favorite. That dish was also eaten quickly, and enjoyed immensely.  After going back and forth over which entree to choose, the grouper dish and the paella were chosen. Little more needs to be said other than a few bites in, we decided to add this place into our restaurant rotation. I saw about 5 other selections I am excited to try on return trips.  We shared laughs with our server plus others who came over to remove plates and refill glasses.   My dinner guests are always complimenting my knack of finding great places to dine out at. I'm thrilled they aren't app savvy, and have no idea how to even use social media. Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, who make my food excursion choices look innate and effortless.",

    "text": "Have been to Madrid twice and Barcelona once. And THIS. is my review.   Suggest making a reservation because it can be busy.   Deceivingly small from the outside but spacious and modern on the inside.  Had the sangria to accompany the meal and it's good.   Had 3 plates of tapas: jamon y manchego, calamares, and empanadas. The jamon isn't jamon iberico but is still decent. The empanadas were flavorful and well seasoned. The calamares we got half fried and half grilled and the grilled option was actually really good as it was sauteed with green peppers, onions, garlic, etc. I recommend the calamares. We also had the paella Valenciana which was okay, nothing to really write home about. It seemed to miss a bit of that bam! flavor. Idk.   So the gentleman taking our order convinced me to get one of the specials of the night: rack of lamb on a healthy portion of mashed potatoes. 4 pieces of the lamb chops were presented to me. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes had pesto on it which was interesting.  My family got the tres leches cake and they said it was really good. The piece I had didn't have a lot of the milk?/creme? soaked so it was a bit dry. I got the flan, which oops! Brain fart, I mistook for creme brulee/crema Catalunya. Wasn't disappointed though, the flan wasn't too sweet and it was light so despite having eaten a bunch was able to finish it.   Good spot to have a little taste of Spain, and I'd like to come back to taste the other dishes.",

Due to distance we asked to get the money refunded because we could not go back to the restaurant that night. Spoke with Nicole , who assured us the manager would do it at some point that night . It's been 3 days . We get the run around when we call. Apparently the manager has been busy for the past 3 days. These people are the most irresponsable , dishonest bunch that we have encounter since moving to the Charlotte area . Check your order because if they mess up you still have to pay for it.",

    "text": "Went here many years ago and weren't impressed, but saw great reviews here & on Trip Advisor so we decided to give it another try. Don't bother! Can't understand why this place gets such good reviews - it's better than fast food, but it isn't a great restaurant by any means.  So disappointed. Had a 7:45 reservation - still waited 25 minutes to be seated even though those who arrived after us were seated before us. The young women at the hostess stand were clearly out of their depth and didn't seem to know how to handle the waiting diners. Quite unprofessional. Mumbled responses to our questions; no eye contact; no apology for the wait. We told the restaurant when we made the reservation that this was a birthday, but no one ever acknowledged it.  Had a pretty good table, but so-so service until after they brought the check, at which time Tomas & Jose were ready to be our best friends. To be fair, Jose was much more attentive than Tomas. Ordered Sangria, which was ok, but even the waiter admitted that the bar no longer added brandy, a usual ingredient in Sangria. Had patatas bravas for an app - just ok. Have had them in Asheville & Puerto Rico and these were not as crunchy or spicy as they should have been. Ordered the carne paella (meat instead of fish). Paella is known for it's crusty rice crust on the bottom of the pan - no crust, no char. It was generic meat & chicken on somewhat bland Spanish rice. I don't know if they dial down the spices for the masses, but some \"nuke food\" has a better flavor profile. Prices were ok, but I'd gladly pay more for food with flavor & good service.  Now we know why we haven't been here in years; won't go back.",

We are usually seated promptly as we always make reservations online.the bar appears to be a hoppin' place although we only go for dinner. The wait-staff is excellent! Friendly, accommodating and attentive.  The food is good. Portions are a bit on the small side, though always tasty. We have not ordered the paella, but have seen it arrive at adjoining tables and it appears to be hot, generous and yummy. Prices are steep for the portions received. A slightly larger portion of \"Spanish rice\" with the entrees would make a huge difference. Bread is always served with the meal and the bottles of cold water are a nice touch.",

It seemed to come out of the frozen food section of Food Lion (no, I've never gone there for groceries based on friends' experiences). Some greasy, tasteless sauce. . .what a shame as the server and hostess were so very nice and professional. Was very surprised to see so many folks heading in there this past Labor Day weekend and have to guess that they were trying Miro out because of a very positive Charlotte Magazine review. Didn't bother to look for a \"Miro ad\" in that issue, but where there is a fantastic review of a restaurant there is usually a paid for advertisement somewhere. It was evident that some of the people dining there were also newcomers checking it out as we were asked more than once if we knew what was good there. Again, servers were professional and wanted to make sure everyone was happy. Clearly the kitchen staff didn't feel the same way.",

I was like hes coming.I felt she wanted to keep us waiting for the 3rd person cause she didnt want to lose a table cause she overbooked the place .We sat there and ordered and the 3rd person came and he asked a question on the menu that we already asked before, the waiter said ask your friends, I already explained this.Really?!! We get the Paella and some other plate, and found hair in my food, but I didnt tell my wife cause I knew she would walk out and it will ruin all our night, even if they changed the dishes.The Paella wasnt good anyway, and I think honestly if you knew anything about paella, you wouldnt come to this place.Finally, we order the check and pay, and literally 5 minutes before we left.The wife of the owner, \"the manager\" comes and tell us, hey you guys want to move to the bar?I can order you something there, because I have a party of 16 who have been waiting for an hour.First of all shes lying, cause we ordered and ate and paid in almost 45 minutes, and there wasnt a party of 16 waiting.Secondly, for the first time in my life I see a manager asking a customer to get up from their table that they reserved and ask us to sit on the bar.In addition to that my wife is pregnant so it would be even harder for her.The owner of the place should teach his rude wife how to run a business and treat customers right.Worst place and customer service ever!",

The Sangria was very  fruity and strong enough to be classified as a mixed drink -- not a wine and fruit juice drink found at many restaurants.  The Caesar Salad was very fresh, and the dressing had very good flavor.  The Paella Valenciana was delicious.  It was served in a skillet shaped bowl that was piping hot.  It had more shrimp and calamari than any other shellfish, but it still had a good portion of mussels, clams, and scallops.  The spanish rice bed had excellent flavor.  It had more red peppers than any other vegetable; it could have had a few more tomato pieces -- maybe this just happened to be my portion.  Watch out for the \"special sauce\".  I like hot sauce, but this sauce was \"muy picante\".  After my first use, I had to be very \"dose conscious\" with the rest of the sauce.  The bread served with the meal was very fresh.  The menu based \"small\" size of the Paella was enough to fill me up (one person), so I had no dessert.  The only Paella that I had that was better was at a restaurant in Newark, NJ in 1990 -- but that has been an unmatched experience over the last 25 years.  Overall, I had a wonderful gastronomic experience at Miro Spanish Grille.",

We had a reservation for 4 at 6:00. When we arrived ,the hostess said there was a bar booth coming available in just a few minutes and we said perfect.We will be at the bar waiting. We tried to order a drink from the normally good bartender, (bald guy). He was rude and right in the middle of us ordering our drink, he just walked away. The other bartender said \"I'll get your martinis and he will get the scotch on the rocks\". He then came back and slammed the drink on the bar spilling part of it and walked off. The other bartender was good and you could tell he was mild mannered and just picked up the slack. Others at the bar were also in amazement of this guys arrogance and behavior. What has happened in this usually nice place???  Bar booths were turned 3 times while we waited!! My husband questioned them and they said, \"oh sorry, the next one is yours, it was now 7:00. Another booth came available and some people took it and just sat down. The hostess would not say it was taken.They just gave that one away too. OK ,really four times now and no table. We will not return, the manager had a attitude of just wait, something will come up soon.  Don't think they cared that we were treated so poorly that we decided to leave. We are all settled 50 year old professionals from the neighborhood. I will pass on our experience to others, Wouldn't want other folks to be treated like we were.",

Calamares ($9) - perfectly fried calamari with marinara and mayo dipping sauces. Chorizo Salteado - ($9) so good on its own or in paella, the chroizo is good Pulpo Gallego ($10) - grilled octopus, good, not too chewy, first time we went was better because it tasted fresher and didn't have a fishy taste Salmon con Mousse de Aguacate ($10) - excellent pairing of smoked salmon with whipped cream cheese and avocado mousse. Langostinos al Pil Pil ($11) - bigger shrimp in a spicier sauce than the garlic shrimp, very good. Almejas con Alcachofas ($11) - sauteed clams with garlic and artichokes, who knew artichokes could taste this good? Patatas Bravas ($8) - good, fried, coated in a nice sticky sauce Jamon y Manchego ($10) - ugh, this was so good, manchego and jamon, how can you go wrong with this pairing? Paella Valenciana ($19) - small, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, and calamari with Spanish rice, pretty good, definitely something to share  They do start with complimentary bread but the second time we went that somehow didn't manifest but to be honest it's unnecessary because you want to fill your belly with good wine and as many tapas as possible. The lamb special with chimichurri sauce is to die for.  Excellent service. But I can definitely see it hit or miss... The outdoor seating is very nice but the indoor seating is bright and tight to add to the atmosphere. If you order dessert they bring out an entire platter of all that they offer save for the tres leches but I don't recommend their dessert because after the raspberry cheesecake and tres leches I felt like every cake on that platter was going to taste the same.  Plenty of parking. Easy to find. Consistent food having gone once a week for 2 weeks on different days.",

    "text": "Tried this place out on a Sunday night. It wasn't busy so we got a table very easily. Got bread and butter as soon as we sat down but the bread was not fresh and the butter tasted like it had been left uncovered in the fridge for a long time! Not very nice! Started with the beef empanadas and the fried shrimp. The shrimp was bathed in a delicious sauce and were scrumptious. The empanadas were pretty good too, they were a first for me because I've never had any that have beef mixed with veggies in them. Had the grouper in cream of crab side with corn over it. Was really good but I feel like there should have been more corn and potato. It felt like I was eating a main without a side.  For dessert had the tres leches that was delicious! Yum! I see myself coming here again and again!",

We made a 7pm reservation and we came right on time. Not to mention they messed up the reservation and put us down for 7:30pm and blame on us for the mistake- who will be there 30 min early with an infant?! And blame on customer or saying I don't know someone here make a mistake- someone means one of you guys. Solve internally before communicate to your customer is the fundamental rule for customer service.  They are spoiled by the customer - have to say they have good food. But they got very arrogant because of that- suck on Charlotte- there is really not many good restaurant here.  What can I say? I guess infant parent don't deserve to dine out :'(",

    "text": "Mmmmm, mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm good! My friends brought me here for my birthday dinner and I'm so glad they did. I tend to think of these places as overpriced, small portions and good but not great but Miro did not disappoint.  The waitress was a gem, wish I remembered her name but she overheard us talking and heard that it was a birthday celebration and all on her own, brought out a lovely piece of cake, candle and all. Now that's attentive service.  We ordered the sampler platter which is mysteriously missing off the menu but it had plantains, shrimp, croquettes, ham and cheese, grilled meat with, I believe chimichurri sauce and I'm sure I am missing something. It's a great start to the meal and wonderful to share and everything was so yummy.  My main course was the small portion of paella and it's enough for leftovers and even enough to share in my opinion. I love spicy and so the waitress brought me out a cup of this hot sauce and thank the good Lord, it was actually spicy. I was so happy because places are always saying something is spicy and then it's no hotter than Frank's Red Hot but this was not.  I told my hubby all about this place and it will be our spot for our next date night.  We stayed until about 20 minutes before closing and didn't even realize we were just about the last ones there and they never gave the vibe or hinted at wanting us to get out. We just happened to look around and notice them cleaning up at the bar area and when we apologized as we left they assured us it wasn't a problem and we were fine and I believed them.  Wonderful spot, delicious, flavorful food and great service. It is a bit more costly (at least for me) but it's worth a special night out. Treat yourself.  That is all!",

I usually get the paella, but our server recommended the Zarzuela de Mariscos --a wonderful seafood stew, loaded with fish, shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams, scallops and lobster in a tomato sauce.   Based on the popularity, I don't have to say you must try, because it is always full--you do need to make a reservation!",

    "text": "WOW! Who knew...we just discovered Miro, our family truly enjoyed our dinning experience. The parking lot is not the ideal location when dinning in the patio ...somehow it did not create a hindrance. Normally, we would have opted to dine in but in all honesty with the heat lamp on and surrounded with family somehow we omitted the sterile surroundings.  We are OUTDOOR folks, it worked ;)   Calamares & chorizo salteado: (starters) Both were very nice, I loved the calamari over the chorizo both worthy of ordering again!   Meat paella: Excellent!! Moist & filled with yummy flavors! I love that you get to opt out of certain ingredients and double UP on others, customizable paella catapults the dish to the 10th power.   Fillet:  The filet was cooked to perfection and very tasty!   Zarzuela De Mariscos: The \"ONLY\" dish that my daughter & husband (both) said they would not order again was the \"Zarzuela De Mariscos.\"   The broth unfortunately was not special, it tasted like it was out of a can (tomato soup). I am sure it was not, however, IF one was doing a blind test it could have easily passed for a canned soup :(  It was void of REAL substance especially for a seafood stew. They need to reinvent this dish as seafood stew broths should be hearty not a thin light watery broth. :/  My husband orders seafood stew ANY chance he gets, in the U.S. or outside the states & he conveyed that their broth sits at the very bottom of his list :/  HE WAS BUMMED!  *LIVE & LEARN, next time will skip the above dish & order a fish dish.  Sangria: We ordered 2 carafes as it was delicious!!  Tres Leche  Their version of \"tres leche\" was straight PERFECTION!  I never cared for tres leche ...I WOULD order it AGAIN as it's not overly sweet like most. Great balance of liquid (not a spongy mess) as well as sweetness.  #nailedit  Our server was impeccable...honestly our server could not have possibly been anymore accommodating!  ***** 5 Stars for our service!!  Buen provecho!",

    "text": "\"Try the Tres Leches cake.\" Um. Okay? I wasn't planning on ordering that. That little detail about not planning to order wasn't an issue. The manager brought us a little sliver of the cake. Holy.... that was 3 years ago and I've been back about 5 more times and brought friends.   Miro Spanish Grille has personality. The atmosphere is a bit dark, romantic and at the same time at ease. The paella is amazing, it has enough flavor that you want to drink the remaining sauce out of the bowl. Now, let's talk service.  The service here is amazing. After the Tres Leches introduction, I came back for lunch with a friend. She was unsure of what she wanted, and was hovering between two items. Without a word, our waiter disappeared and came back with a samples of both items. The bread is crunchy, soft on the inside and everything I've tried has been a winner.  Price? Well, it is in line with other restaurants in the Ballantyne area. I'd suggest trying them for lunch and then graduating to dinner. You'll be back. Reservations for dinner are an excellent idea. Now, there is one mystery to this place that we laugh about. There are almost always 2-3 staff members who make the rounds and walk around looking at everything. I haven't seen them fill a glass, or pick up a plate. I'm wondering if maybe they're there to be the servers' eyes and ears? I thought I was the only person who noticed this, but then my mom went and asked me the same thing. Maybe, just maybe they're those kind of water dudes who are so good you don't even notice they refill the glasses? Unsure, but when I go back (which I will), I'll pay closer attention and let you know.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "For a place that has such wonderful reviews, I expected both good food and good service. The food was unexceptional, but I did not try the entire menu, so my review is not negative for that reason alone. The service is what motivates this negative review: it was terrible. I do not know whether we had a new hire--a fast speaking fellow that wore red framed glasses--but it was apparent upon our first introduction that he didn't have much time for us. The real indication arose when we (my date and I) received a lackluster artichoke marinated in vinegar. It looked and tasted like something pre-prepared at the grocery store. I gave it a try, hoping that it might taste better if I tried the heartier bits, but it was no use. It sucked.   We left the artichoke untouched, expecting an inquiry by our server as would be common at most high end restaurants. We waited, and waited, until the server came to take our plates away. He finally asked how it was, and we told him we didn't like it at all. He took our other plates and left this grocery store concoction on our table. We waited again. We discussed between ourselves whether there was some miscommunication, so we awaited the waiter's return. When he arrived, he asked if we wanted him to take our untouched artichoke. We said yes, and tried to imply what he should do. We very kindly asked if we could have another appetizer instead. He didn't seem to understand, so we said it again. At this point, he seemed visibly annoyed. He asked point blank, \"so are you saying you want Empanadas?\" Assuming he'd understood our plea--or just hoping--I said yes. He returned with them; they were alright.   And then the check arrived. There I was greeted with the charge for those nasty artichokes in addition to the Empanadas. I was perplexed. I flagged our waiter, and reminded him that he forgot to take the artichoke off our bill.  He was even more perplexed, and visibly annoyed. He asked, \"didn't you order that?\" Yes, we did, but it was terrible, and we spoke about this already! He sharply exclaimed that he'd talk to his manager. He must have because the bill was quickly and hardly plopped on our tabletop without a word or look from the waiter. The artichoke billings had vanished as quickly as our resolve to return. I hope this was an aberration. But I wouldn't feel comfortable returning to possibly run into our friend with the red-rimmed spectacles.",

The wine selection is fantastic and the staff here is some of the best I've ever experienced. I honestly can't even believe that I haven't reviewed this place before now! Aside from the food this place is one of my go to places when coordinating work dinners for out of town guests. My SVP who lives in LA looked at me funny when I brought him here, but now every single time he's in Charlotte he requests at least one dinner be scheduled here! They never fail to accommodate our large group, inevitably last minute. Last time I was here I had the steak and it was mouth watering. Also never leave here without having dessert. They will bring out this large plate full of dessert choices, but I urge you to ignore all of it and insist on having the tres leche cake!! It is the best tres leche cake I've ever had and I can't come here and not get it. This is a restaurant that never fails to deliver in all arenas!!",

Today's visit made me Hisss. Miro was our \"special occasion \" place like Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc. We love their paella, a truly Spanish \"Spaniard\" plate. Unfortunately they have fused other plates onto their menu that aren't Spanish at all like the plantains, but most people in the area wouldn't know the difference anyway. While on the subject I also wish they played real Spanish music like flamenco, gypsy, etc instead of Salsa which is more Cuban (Caribbean\") or merengue and Bachata which is Dominican. It wouldn't surprise me to one day hear Mariachi music. Not that there is anything wrong with that if you're in a Mexican restaurant that is. I just wish they could stay in the Spanish \"Spaniard\" style more. It's like being able to order a frankfurter in a French restaurant and listening to polka music. If makes no sense and it cheapens the establishment a bit. Hisss.",

I won't review the food because I got it Togo and I realize that it is a little different than ordering it in the store. The empanadas where good though.

The service has been spotty each time, and it just feels like more of a transaction than anything else.  The one thing I will say about them is that their tapas are fantastic. Just off the top, both shrimp dishes, patatas bravas, empanadas, mushrooms are all crazy good. They also have amazing bread they serve up front before ordering.  Where I'm not thrilled is with every entree I've gotten there. I've gotten the salmon once, and two specials that they've offered day of. They've just been so underwhelming I haven't bothered to finish any of them.  I'd say if you just want some good tapas and don't particularly care about the price or service, then this is a great spot because the tapas are on point. For anything else? I'd recommend finding another place to dine.",

Fried Calamari was so light and crispy, the Paella was fresh and savory...and everything was just perfectly delicious!   The service was also flawless. Though seated in a booth by the bar, the waiter was quick and attentive...and everything was served seamlessly, not to mention perfectly timed.  Even the ambiance! The place had a dark, city chic vibe, but somewhat casual at the same time. Featuring distinctively Spanish paintings (of Matadors and Bulls?) on the wall, the restaurant offered both stand alone chairs, as well as a few booths...though most booths were by the bar area. Then the perfectly complementing overhead music, complete with Spanish guitar.  Guess you can that it was a perfectly delightful lunch experience. I definitely need to revisit real soon!",

Our group ordered the paellas, zarzuela de mariscos, and grouper. The portions are large and can easily be divided between 2 persons. I shared the zarzuela de mariscos (kind of a seafood stew) with a friend. We ordered an extra portion of rice.  It was delicious. The sauce was so good, I wish I had some bread to dip it in what was left.    Service was great, as it should be. We were promptly seated in a comfortable location. Our waiter was bilingual and had grown up in Spain.    Also, I brought a birthday cake and candles (in a box) to the hostesses's counter.

    "text": "Very pleased with Miro.  A classy restaurant with great food.  And, by the way, some luxury tapas.  Interior of this former breakfast/lunch place is booths and tables and the atmosphere is subdued lighting, lending an air of class.   Also a very competent bar for cocktails.  Table service is accomplished by competent wait staff who operate without notes...well, at least some of them do.  The menu is rich in offerings, many of which need further explanation, so don't be shy to ask your wait staff.  The tapas can be a meal in themselves.  Count them.  I got 20 on the menu...quite a variety.  They are generous portions and not just the simple little snack as they traditionally are served in Spain.  These have certainly been Americanized for our appetites.  We had salad (four choices) and soup (four choices).  And mixed cocktails.  Thought we did not have steak, we did look over what they have and it is done in a clever way.  You order what cut you want, then chose the sauce/topping from the six offered, along with one of the four sides.  Worth a future challenge.  Spanish specialties of the house range from paella to fresh seafood (I chose the red snapper which was great) to short ribs, chicken and pork.  Also vegetarian and more chicken dishes.  Wife had the grilled eggplant and really liked it because it did not taste like eggplant.  You will certainly find SOMETHING you might like.  The wine flowed in our table of four.  So much so that we had two desserts to share with coffee. I can't remember what, but they both tasted really fine.  Great date place, a little pricey...but well worth it.  Miro is not only a restaurant, but an experience...to repeat.",

All tapas were prepared perfectly, the bread served was hot, freshly baked, service was great as well.  Also, the place doesn't break the bank, each item is reasonability priced for the quality and the quantity. At the end of the meal the server brings over a beautiful plate of dessert offerings that you have to try and totally worth saving room for.  Definitely a place to consider while you are in the area.",

Upscale casual environment, could work great for a date night or workplace lunch. Servers were very friendly and knowledgeable. Service was pretty quick and food presentation was beautiful. Excellent value at lunch - most entrees between $9-$12 and HUGE portions. Something for everyone - tapas, seafood, chicken, pasta, vegetarian. And the dessert tray is LOADED with choices including delicious flan. Highly recommended. (Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because they were a little awkward bringing out our dishes. Several people got served first and there was quite a delay before the other entrees arrived. It was awkward at a business lunch since everyone wanted to wait until we were all served. But meanwhile their food was getting cold!)",

    "text": "Let's be real - there isn't much of a selection in Charlotte for Spanish cuisine. While everywhere is now offering up \"tapas,\" sometimes I still want some good ole TAPAS - jamon, manchego, croquettes, gambas etc.  This is my 1st visit to the new location (to think of it, I can barely remember visiting the old location). It's closer for me coming from Uptown area, and parking is nowhere as crazy as Stonecrest - both are pluses. The place was packed on a Friday night, so even though we had a reservation, we had to wait just a little for a table.  Service overall was ok - our waitress was eager and enthusiastic (at times maybe a little too enthusiastic but I am not complaining). My friend and I ended up starting out the night with the Pulpo Gallego and Jamon y Manchego. I enjoyed the grilled octopus, thus it was a little under seasoned for my tastebuds. The serrano ham were good as well as the mangchego cheese, but you don't get much in an order. For both of the dishes to be priced at $10, the grilled octopus is definitely the better deal.  For entree we shared an order of Marbella. I never had squid ink pasta so I was excited about trying something new. This pasta dish was full of flavor without being too heavy. They were very kind to split the portion up in two for us, and my half was more than enough to fill me.  We ended the night with a slice of tres leches. They did have some very impressive looking options, all so gracefully presented on a silver tray for decision making. BUT there's no better option than tres leches.  Overall it was a very pleasant experience.",

When I first came to this place as you can see in my first review I was very impressed and the food was delicious. I feel like they've gotten comfortable and have slacked in that area as well as the service. The young waiter was very nice and very accommodating, however he needs to cool it with the Rico Sauve attitude. Getting back to the food,  we ordered the garlic shrimp, plantains, empanadas, potatoes bravas and jamon croquettes. First off, the garlic shrimp were smaller than the last time, not as good quality and swimming in oil. We sent hem back. The potatoes bravas came out smothered in so much sauce that you could barely identify what they were. They were not the same potatoes we had three months ago. The empanadas were good but were only served one and a half, not cool. They couldn't give us two??? The croquettes tasted like pureed spam and it came with what can only be described as mayonnaise without a flavor. They were very generous with our wine and topped off my glasses very nicely. A friend of mine had A chicken dish and wasn't impressed at all. It's a shame that this restaurant has gone that way since it was just absolutely delicious the first time that my boyfriend and I were there. I'm going to try a different Spanish restaurant that is consistent with their quality and service. Ole!",

An outstanding venue with both classic and newer dishes from all across Spain.  Really nice music also (a big plus for me).  Note that the paella comes to order (request the seared rice for authenticity).  Highly recommended!",

Next came the pork chops, which were so tender and delicious. The red peppers stuffed with goat cheese and spinach came last and were a nice contrast to the spice. Next came the house salads and they were very fresh and crisp. We shared the meat paella as our main course. The lamb was tender and cooked just right. The chorizo was plentiful as well. Definitely a keeper. We read about the Tres Leche here on Yelp, so we shared that as well. So delicious and definitely something to try. Since we put our phones away for our meal there are no pics, sorry. The waitress was super polite and the service was fast. Everyone that served us was beyond pleasant.  When I went in search of the restroom, no less than 3 staff members pointed me in the right direction without me even asking. We can't wait to go back!",

There were plenty of people here in shorts.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. He made us feel very special. I had one of the specials for the night and it was fantastic. We had a great bottle of spanish wine recommended by our waiter. This place has a great dessert selection. They bring out a big plate with many amazing deserts on it. We had the Tres Leches cake, recommended by our waiter. This cake was amazing. It was the moistest cake I've ever had in my life. This cake was so moist, it was like liquid standing up. I can't believe it didn't just flow out onto the plate. After dinner we drifted over to the bar area and had 2 of the best Mojito's I've had in Charlotte. So, overall, a 5 star experience.",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews for this place I had thought that the food would be amazing here. I was sadly disappointed. My husband and I started our dinner off with ordering three tapas. We ordered the shrimp in olive oil, the sauteed jumbo shrimp and the parmesan scallops.   The sauteed jumbo shrimp were not flavorful at all. I felt like it needed salt and I never put salt on anything. The jumbo shrimp were also pretty tough, almost like they were overcooked. The sauce on them was bland and just didn't wow me at all.  The shrimp in olive oil came out sizzling hot and were definitely cooked well. Again, the flavors were lack luster and I wasn't really impressed with it.  The parmesan scallops were my favorite. Although teeny tiny, the scallops were cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauce and cheese made for a delicious combination.  For our entree my hubby and a split the seafood paella. It was good. I have had better paella. I felt that the clams were overly fishy tasting, however, the calamari in it was to die for! Overall the paella was good and the price was right for it as well.  We ended our dinner by splitting the chocolate/white chocolate cake. That was really good, but by that time I was way to full.  Oh and I forgot to add the sangria was really good.  Overall I was really disappointed with this place. Everyone had given it rave reviews and I love Spanish Tapas, but it just didn't do it for me.",

An hour later we we seated (which is why they lost a star). Once seated the waitress came and discussed options, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. As we were a party of 4 we ordered several tapas to share...everything was well prepared and seasoned. Croquetas was the favorite of the night but the Jamon and Manchego with the warm bread was excellent as well. Muscles and octopus was cooked just right. The only dish that was just ok in our opinion were the empanadas which were nothing special. The Sangria was superb but on the pricey side (30$ a carafe). If they can get the front of the house performance to match the back this place will be a go to for a long time!",

Once inside, you will find a modern, sophisticated decor and a menu full of delicious choices.   On our visit we had the calamari (served in a rich, atypical style), grilled octopus, paella and a stuffed eggplant entree...all pleasantly unlike what we expected.   Perhaps the most enjoyable part of the evening was our bartender William who immediately got the party going as he regaled us with stories that would make more modest folk blush. We are not the blushing types, so his bringing us into the fold of regulars at the bar made it hard to leave at the end of our night. We felt as if we were among friends we had known for years...think back in those two years you spent in that reform school.  We will be back. We have to, after all, we have more dishes to try and we know William has more stories to tell. They'll be much more shady than a '50 Shades of Grey' sequel, and I wouldn't miss that kind of entertainment for anything.",

The mashed potatoes were forgettable but the strip steak and chimichurri is making my mouth water while typing. The steak was tender, juicy, thick, cooked beautifully, and the chimichurri was abundantly flavorful.  Ella got the \"Carne de las costillas cortas\" oven braised beef short ribs in white wine with potatoes and carrots, topped with a natural al jus and served with sauteed green beans. The braised beef was incredibly soft and pulled apart with the greatest of ease. What we loved most about this dish was the combination of bold colors on the plate and the the balance of fresh veggies with the braised short ribs.  The couple sitting next to us was so intrigued with all of the photos I had been taking of our food that they offered their food up for the photo spotlight. I never got a chance to taste their dish (Vieiras Chilindron Sauteed scallops topped with fresh tomatoes and peppers sauce, served with seasoned white rice) but it looked gorgeous. Unfortunately (for me) I just cant bring myself to like seafood and if these were the best scallops in the world... they would be wasted on my palate.  Miro Spanish Grille was absolutely delicious and an easy recommendation for South Charlotte.",

The atmosphere remains comfortable and classy but not stuffy.  You'll always find great service at Miro.  The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and can answer questions and give recommendations.  There are specials every day that they can rattle off with ease, and I'm not talking about 2 or 3 things.  It's more like 8 or 10.    You'll find all your traditional Spanish dishes here as well as some Spanish-American fusion type things.  My favorites are the paella and the red snapper.  Things are reasonably priced for the good quality that you will get.  The dessert menu is insanity, and they literally bring the dessert items to you on a platter for you to drool over as you ponder your decision.  There are cakes a' plenty, torts, pastries, and my favorite - the tres leches.  Check out the picture I posted and tell me you don't want that!   This is my favorite restaurant in Ballantyne a place you must visit if you're in the area looking for a nice meal.",

I was so glad to see Miro hopping on a Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m. The fella and I made a reservation on their website (didn't they used to be on OpenTable?) and were promptly seated in a booth at the bar.  They have totally transformed the space that used to be Brig's. The waiting area is as big as Brig's was, which means huge compared to Miro's old waiting area. The bar is also massive with dark wood and warm, hanging, pendant lights. The back wall on either side (dning room and bar) is stone with wine bottles lining it. I got an Ilios Noche at Quail Corners feel.  Our waiter took a little bit of time to get to us, but once he did, he got in a groove. We jumped right in and got the Churrasco de Cerdo ($17) for me - pork tenderloin with chimichurri sauce, plantains, rice, and beans - and the Paella de Carna ($23) for the fella, which came with lamb, chicken, chorizo, beef, and pork. Mine was good, but the chicken could've had a little more flavor or sauce, but the fella's was awesome. Meat on top of meat on top of paella on top of the best roasted red peppers I've had in a loooong time. Their wine selection is pretty darn good, too.  I'm so glad that Miro is in the neighborhood, and they're off to an awesome start.",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated in a simple fashion. It reminded me of a dining room in a home that you like to visit. Our waiter was very well versed in the specials and the menu and was able to make sense of our orders as we tried to pronounce the dishes correctly. In my favor all of the ice tea was unsweet and there were plenty of sweeteners available to add. I had an appetizer in a wonderful garlic sauce, Langoustines au Pil Pil, and for my entree I had the Paella Valenciana. It was excellent. Its a good thing that I ordered the small serving because it was huge! A sizzling pan was brought out with lots of delicious seafood and a spicy rice that paired very well together. I really can't wait to go back. A friend recommended the Zarzuela de Moriscos. He said that it was excellent. I don't want to have to wait till the lights go out again. Hopefully my wife will branch out and try something new. Its an amazing restaurant.",

The service is fantastic.   Best of all are the lunch prices!!!  $12 for paella!!  But really the lunch prices are great, I believe they are all under $15.  Also I think the parking is easier at Torringdon then in Stonecrest.  The employees are all super friendly and helpful too!",

Only problem is that the restaurant is too loud, as it seems most are these days. This has been a problem at Mrio since they moved from Stonecrest to this location. When they first opened here, they said they knew it was too loud and that they were experimenting with sound treatments. If so, none have been very effective.  We'll still go back for the food, but not immediately.",

The service was excellent, even though we had to sit at the bar with our 5 year old; I appreciate how accommodating the bartenders were.  We ordered the Serrano ham & manchego tapas, the chorizo mussels, & empanadas to start, with the Valencia paella for our main, and took home Tres Leche.  I really can't tell you which was my favorite, they were all so good.  The Tres Leche is seriously amazing as I sit here writing this review and polishing it off (we got it to go).  Oh and the Sangria, excellent!  We ordered 2 1/2 carafes...shouldve just ordered the full.  Finally a good Sangria and made fresh daily.  I highly recommend this gem next to EarthFare and we will be back!!",

We probably could and would have finished within an hour (depending on the kitchen) but after that reception, I think not. We left.

I'm not usually a fan of fried foods but these were really good, not oily at all with a nice crispy exterior and delicious soft and savory interior.   Gambas al Ajillo - These came sizzling hot in the plate (literally still sizzling) with a tad bit of spicy heat as well. Others at my table really liked it.  Gratinadas - I wasn't really a fan, way too much cheese covering the scallops. Was a standard baked cheese dish. But take my words with a grain of salt since I dislike cheese.  Pulpo Gallego - Don't miss this! The octopus was really good. Usually octopus can end up too chewy, and I was expecting a whole leg cut up into pieces. Instead, it came sauteed and sliced up into smaller pieces and was super tender and flavorful. Probably my favorite tapas.   Salmon con mousse de aguacate - Worst dish, came at the recommendation of the waiter. Very standard lox mixed with a weird avocado/cheese mix - wasn't quite guacamole given the random chunks of cheese.  Paella - Wow. This did not disappoint. Probably the best main I've tried here - this dish is flavorful and packed with seafood. The scallop I had was soft and delicious.  Zarzuela - It's very similar to paella, with a lot of the same seafood elements, but somehow I thought the paella pulled off the flavors better and the seafood was more tender in the paella (i.e. the scallops)  Lamb special - It was one of the specials for the night and I couldn't resist ordering it. Came atop a heaping pile of mashed potatoes with 4 lamb chops. The lamb chops were good - very tender (I asked for medium rare), but I found myself wishing it had a bit more flavor or perhaps just salt. Nothing wrong with it - cooked very well, just not quite as good as the paella.  Tiramisu cheesecake - I wasn't a huge fan but that's because I dislike cheesecake in general.",

I highly recommend reservations as this is a small venue and very popular.   Let's talk  more about the paella.  Oh my goodness -yum!  it's perfectly seasoned, so full of wonderful seafood and such a generous portion (you can order a smaller portion, but then you wouldn't have a doggie bag for later!). They also have a very similar stew version of the paella which is equally amazing.   I've forced my way onto other people's plates (at my table, not strangers.  but don't think I'm not tempted!) and can absolutely tell you everything is cooked to perfection - fish, pork, meats, apps all of it. The waitstaff is fantastic and knows the menu well but they can work a little bit on the friendliness of the teenage/young person hostesses.  I would love to see a couple more options on the wine list, or maybe just different labels?   The pic of the shrimps were very lightly cooked in garlic, oil and paprika.  Simple ingredients, done well.  The empanadas are very tasty too, but I'm more familiar with Central American style but my boys think they're great!",
