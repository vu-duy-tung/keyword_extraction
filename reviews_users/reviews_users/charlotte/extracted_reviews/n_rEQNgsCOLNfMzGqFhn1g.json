Food was good, standard Chinese, nothing to write home about, but it was served hot and fast. I had the shrimp and broccoli with a spring roll, and there was more shrimp than broccoli! That's a first! It wasn't a HUGE lunch portion but it was filling and I took half of it home. Quiet atmosphere, secluded on the side of a shopping center, lots of parking. A good option for Chinese in the area.",

    "text": "After reading about some recent reviews, I decided to stop by to check out the lunch specials. Unfortunately I went on a Sunday, when they only offer the buffet. So, after reviewing the buffet options, and noticing it was $9.50, I figured why not. The Sunday buffet offers two soups, wings, two rices (brown & white) and 9 entrees, including beef with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and shrimp, beef with peppers, seafood with cashews among a few.  I started with the egg drop soup and wasn't thrilled, a little luke warm. However, the fried chicken wings were good. As for the entrees, I tried the beef with broccoli, which was the first to go, and the cashew seafood, general tso's chicken and sweet and sour chicken. All were good, but overall I prefer fresh meals, served hot and fresh. Although they seemed to fill the trays often, they seemed to go pretty quickly and those that remained definitely lacked in heat.  Overall everything was good & servers seem to be all around to assist with anything. I am just not a buffet person, but will return on a weekday to check out a preferred dish only.",

Well we are here tonight and I have to say that it will be a very long time before I come back. The egg rolls were over cooked and old, the dough inside was yellow which indicates that they were old. The chicken was not very good either. Maybe they changed their chef but they need to do something ASAP. I can tell you not sure if I am coming back",

I say usually as one dinner trip, it took us close to 45 min to be served and tables that came in after us were served before us and we saw one couple leave after waiting for a while. Service is a hit or miss, really depends on the day and who serves you. We have seen bad and we have seen great but keep in mind it isn't a five star French restaurant when setting expectations. Decor is a bit dark and dated. Not a big deal for us, we will continue to visit as we heart their mapo tofu. Mangolian beef with the soft wraps and chinese broccoli with oyster sauce are also on our reg list.  Often comes up on Groupon, we usually buy one our two.",

    "text": "For Chinese food this place gets a three (3 yelp stars) from me.  I love the Chinese Cabbage and that was about it.  The Beef Dish I ordered was too salty and the Beef was over cooked though I do not think that was the determining factor   it tasted too plain  for my dish I rate it 2.55 yelp stars.  The Pineapple Fritters were perhaps made exactly as they were supposed to be though I did not like them.  The batter was too thick, some were overcooked and some were undercooked (batter gooey on the inside) 1 yelp star.  The service was A-OK as in 3 yelp stars.    The Fish Tanks, Lighted Tree, Red Display Cases with carved tusks and Ceiling in the Bar show some potential in Decorating!    They had a good Monday night crowd for a Monday night and were doing a lot of takeout.  Not much concern that I only took one bite of my HUGE Dessert, nor when I told them I did not care for it and no offer to comp it!  It would NOT have helped me rate the dine any higher though.  I would eat here again if Charlotte did not offer any better Restaurant choices!",

Since this is no cheap buffet place, we were seated to a table and had two menus, one for lunch and the other specials.  I choose the special, which was spicy shredded meat (forgot name) with celery and carrots with pork fried rice and egg roll.  The table with provided with complimentary bowl of crisps with sweat sauce and mustard sauce; they were not stale, so kudos there.  I also ordered a sweat tea (came with lemon), it was sweat and not watered down.  The meal itself was indeed spicy, but not too overpowering since I didn't sweat.  The fried pork rice was very good and the shredded meat with veggies complimented one another.  The egg roll was fat and yummy.  Overall, it was all very good and was able to clean the plate.  The menu and prices provided during lunch is what you would find at many other Chinese restaurants in the area, so there is nothing unique.  However, the flavors and how its prepared is definitely better than some in the area; this place is worth another visit.",

If you grew up on the west coast or somewhere that has a large china town you will be severely disappointed as you have been with all Chinese food you've tried in Charlotte.   I'm not even sure where to start, I'm still mourning the 30 dollars I just threw away. I ordered several things. I'll start with the beef chow mien. It was very soupy and did not have any noodles? Very strange. Moving on to the veggie spring rolls. Since when do veggie spring rolls include shrimp? New to me. The onion pancake was incredibly dry. I've always just bought these frozen from the Asian market and fried in a pan but have never had one that was dry. Remaining items, pot stickers, generals chicken, and white rice were incredibly bland and rice was so dry it was pretty much inedible.    Maybe I hit this place on an off night, but if you're looking for a new good Chinese place I say keep walkin' don't bother.",

(Other than Little Ceasars, Mamma Rosas in Pineville & Chucky Cheese).  Yah, I'm old.  I remember when Winn-Dixie was still in Carmel Commons.      Family owned.  SUPER FRIENDLY managers.  Gets busy on weekends.  VERY fast take-out service.  Once bumped into Jim & Tammy Baker during lunch.   Standard \"American\" Chinese food.  Poo Poo platter fun with the flaming sterno cauldron.  THEY DO HAVE A REAL CHINESE MENU, but you'll need to ask for it.    Bar Area waiting.  Kids love the multiple fish tanks.  Fun place to people watch.  Don't worry if your kid spills fried rice all over the floor.  They won't fret about it.    Always ask for the house made mustard and duck sauce if you're getting take-out.    Bummed Baskin Robbins closed. . .as for years we'd stuff outselves on Beef & Brocoli and then waddle down for a pint of Mint Choc Chip.  BE CAREFUL about drinking and driving.  CMPD and even Pineville patrol the area on a regular basis.  Better to get a cab than put yourself in that situation.",

Where different waiters/waitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order, then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further.. The crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic, like something I could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals ALSO were not deveined... And every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland... The only thing I enjoyed was the wonton soup! And then at the end of our meal, around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat.. Being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm.. A waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now... O_o  So we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold.. He never asked how the food was or anything, just \"this how much!\" And swiped the cards... Such a waste of money and time.. Worst Chinese food ever!",

I even suffered severe\" Groupon Guilt\" when the meal was over and the check came. To be completely honest I could not bring myself to use it on my first visit. The food had been too wonderful. The wait staff was too good.  I ordered 3 entrees that day...figuring I would take home the leftovers. I had scallion chicken made with dark meat chicken (your choice)  , fresh vegetables with tofu ( medium spicy) and chicken and broccoli . All were outstanding..  The atmosphere is hard to find anymore. Three large aquariums dominate the two levels of dining area. I chose a booth in the bar area that is right next to one of the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftanks.It&s=06a9fcb80e9891eafe9e9fc7aa4a2bf20089c06acfae0abe2d7ecd0a6673ac9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tanks.It</a> is soo relaxing to just watch the fish swim. You understand why Drs offices always had aquariums back in the 1900s.  If you are looking for a Chinese food \"fix\" this is the place. I am tired of the little dingy take-out joints that are  in every strip mall. This place is an escape to a more sophisticated era of Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. I also tried the lunch buffet and it was excellent. Enjoy.",

Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order.

Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us, I had to flag someone down and I said \"I think our waitress has forgotten about us...\" The man says \"what you want\" ummm to order? Hes like \"Yes, what you want just staring at us, no smile or apology. So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later. Had to wait forever for our check. I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked. To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor. No idea why this place was full. Many great chinese restaurants around, this is not one.",

Because I usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go. I was wrong. The wait staff leaves a lot to be desired, the hosts are great. However, the gentleman passed by me literally 8 times and did not refill my water for a good 15 minutes. I basically had to flag him down and tell him to please refill it. We ordered the sesame cold noodles. Which I love the peanut sauce but way too much soy in there so it came off extremely salty. Also we order the favorite shrimp (which is that sweet mayo shrimp) and sesame chicken. Okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting. The sauce tasted old and I couldn't even stomach to eat it. The side of broccoli was just drizzle with soysauce and salty!  the sesame chicken was average however I did enjoy how they didn't soak it in sauce. I asked for extra vegetables and we were charged more for it but got literally just a spoon full of vegetables. Jade Asian Fusion and Dim Sum tastes so much better",

    "text": "We dined here yesterday, at my brother's request for his birthday.  The atmosphere is nice, and we were greeted by a very pleasant hostess.  We were even seated by the fish tank; a real treat.  Our waiter, however, seemed to be having a bad day, or maybe not feeling well.  The service here is really hit or miss, either very good or really bad.  I ordered the Crispy Shrimp, expecting just that.  The waiter even warned me that it is spicy, which was fine with me.  What I received seemed to be maybe sweet and sour shrimp, I'm just not sure.  It was served with orange slices, in a big glop of gelatinous, sticky goop.  Nothing crispy or spicy about it!  It also had candied walnuts, which would have been great with a dessert.  I know a lot of people like really sweet entrees, I'm just not one of them, especially when expecting a crispy, spicy shrimp dish.  My brothers, however, enjoyed their meals; one had seafood lo mein, and the other a sizzling steak  (which is just a plate of meat and mushroom gravy, absolutely no vegetables!)  I got one shrimp down, and that was it for me.  My brothers each tasted a shrimp, but both passed on another bite.  The waiter never even returned to check on us, so I just ate a little rice to be polite while my brothers finished their meals.  The restaurant got kind of busy, and later the waiter finally showed up with the check, but didn't even comment on my basically untouched plate.  I asked him if this was Crispy Shrimp, and he sort of halfway nodded.  He did bring me a box, and at the price I paid, I decided to go ahead and take it, but I later dumped it in my brother's refrigerator ( a little extra birthday gift!).  I'm so happy my brothers enjoyed their meal, but I left hungry, with a much lighter wallet, and pretty disappointed.  I'll probably go back at some point, but will certainly hope for better service.  We all have our bad days, but even a simple smile would have gone a long way!  My advice is to try to make sure you know exactly what you're ordering, because the dinner menu gives little, if any, description and the waiter may or may not be helpful.",

Food was always hot, order was alway correct and always ready in the time quoted.  That has changed dramatically.  I thought the last time was a fluke but it has happened again.  I was told 15 minutes for pick up. Arrived 20 minutes after I ordered.  Food was not ready.  After 25 minutes my name was called and the order was incorrect.  The gentleman in charge told me I would need to take my order as is or wait another 15 minutes for the missing fried rice and soup.  Had to explain taking a carry out order back without someone's. Dinner was not an option not was waiting 15 minutes for something that should take less than five minutes.  Left 10 minutes later with my order and a \"free\" soup.  This is the last time we will order from Great Wall.  Wanfu is closer to our home and lately the food and service is much better.  Sad to see the  changes that have happened at Great Wall.  It was great.",

But what can you say, generally at Asian establishments, lacking service is usually the trend. However, if you are craving AUTHENTIC Cantonese food, this place is it!! This is a hidden gem that you do not know about this place. Sure you can order the regular Americanized Chinese food. But why when you can get pea sprouts, steamed fish, steamed chicken, Chinese ribs with bean paste sauce etc? A pretty cool aquarium inside with live reef. The only downer is our waiter never bothered to come refill over beverages. She kind of took our order, dropped down our food and peaced out;. I think this place is definitely short staffed, the owner ended up coming out to bring out our checks.",

Just for the food, I'll give a 4 star considering it's in Charlotte. (I'm referring to the authentic Chinese food menu.) The Jiang Ya (marinated duck) is my favorite. La zi Ji is also  decent.   The service was great for my experience. The waitress paid attention to what is left over on the table and asked why we didn't eat it and then exchanged a new one after we told her we simply didn't really like the flavor of the pork.   I'm giving five star here because I believe this place deserves more positive comments than It has now.",

I went to the restroom while I waited for them to cook it. I got an egg roll and soup. I came out and she was all ready. I said wow, that was fast. Usually and egg roll takes a minute or two to cook. When I got back to the office I found out why. First no spoon or soy Sauce. then the egg roll was soggy. They did not even cook it fresh. Yuck. It was so bad. The egg drop soup had no flavor either. I woudl pass this place by in a heart beat. Had they been busy I woudl say, oh they are busy, but there was no one in the place.

He thought he found a good place once on his lunch break and wanted me to try it for dinner, so we went.  It was aweful.  How can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls.  The sesame chicken was terrible.  The shrimp with garlic sauce just ok.  And the waiter was MIA after we got our food...we wanted to get some extra white rice at least and then our check at the end took forever, it was bad.  We also returned that wonton soup back to the kitchen since it was so bad.  Lastly, I did not think a tip was deserved so I made that known...and the owner was pissed off and made sure to tell my husband about it, but honestly I do not care.

    "text": "Five years ago we first experienced Great Wall and it was excellent.  Then it entered the land of yuck and for four years we have not returned until a couple of our neighbors invited us to join them.  We really did not want to eat at Great Wall, but did, just to be neighborly.  And are we glad we did!  The Charlotte Observer food critic had mentioned that they had a new chef and kitchen crew and it shows.  We both raved at how wonderful the food was.  Portions were very large, more for sharing than for one person.  Flavors were back with each bite bringing yet another certain spice or tang or texture.  I usually order the combinations like one of their two specials shrimp, beef and chicken and another variety of different meats.  Excellent!  The service was prompt and the waiter very authentic being a bit hard to understand but he accommodated all of our unique requests.  As to spicy, it was not, so if you are like us who prefer a kick to our food, we think you need to specifically go for extra spicy.  Their normal spice level was not detectable, but the food still was good.  Thank you for bringing back the excellent Chinese food and dishes from five years ago.  For those of you who have or had kissed off the Great Wall...come back and be pleasantly surprised.  I am holding my breath for a return visit hoping that our recent experience was not a fluke.  Oh I certainly hope not.",

We ordered General Tso Chicken, Garlic Beef and additional stir fried vegetable entrees.  They all taste the same. Dark brown sauce with too much corn starch and no spices. Garlic was not in the beef. Chicken should be a little sweet with a small kick of heat in a light sauce. I specifically asked to make it Szechuan level of  spicy. What we got was 3 entrees that were so gummy and bland. I look for pieces of garlic and ginger and found none. When I can make better stir fry at home using fresh spices that have a dramatic distinction between each dish, you know it's not a place you want to eat. Nothing authentic or Chinese about this food. Very poor experience and  totaI waste of money. Sad, as I  was really rooting for them. ;-(",

To find out that they haven't even started making my order. I guess they was waiting to get payment first before they started making the food. And if that is the case they should have told me that in the first hand.   Needless to say that I had to wait another 20min for my food to be ready.   I haven't even tasted the food yet so I will update this review after I eat.",

But I came back and am glad to say the restaurant is updated and the food was too.    The cook did great at preparing delicious meals that we knew and loved.  I ordered a meal no longer on the new updated menu and no problem they fixed it ! Lake Tung Ting Shrimp- jumbo shrimp with veggies in a light white sauce. It was delicious!  The hubs had beef with veggies and it also was very delicious.  I was surprised and very pleased that the restaurant finally offered actual brown rice. The use to offer rice with soy sauce and called it brown rice but now they actually serve authentic brown rice!!! Yeah   The interior dinning areas have had nice updates including fresh paint & new modern tile designs on the walls that brings this 1980's Charlotte landmark into the 20th century !!!   The staff are efficient as ever and well this is the Great Wall Restaurant I knew and loved for so many years.  Glad I came back - I'd say you should stop in and try it ... two thumbs up!",

The chicken lettuce wraps we ordered were decent, nothing great about them. The waitress was very nice. I ordered garlic chicken and my kid ordered orange chicken. The orange chicken looked decent and wasn't too bad. My garlic chicken tastes weird. The sauce and veggies that were in and on it were tasty but the chicken didn't have the consistency of real chicken. It had no real texture, was softer than bread, melted with one bite, and had a funky taste to it. It was clear that this was a seriously processed meat PRODUCT. Ewwww. I told the waitress and she brought her \"manager\" over. As soon as he opened his mouth, he had a major attitude. \"So you don't like your food\" he said in a snarky tone. I then said, \"This chicken tastes funny, it's not real chicken or something, the texture isn't consistent with real chicken\" He was visibly pissed then asked if he could remove the plate. He then said, \"Do you mind if I taste it?\" I said, \"Go ahead\". He then stuck his fingers in the plate, grabbed a piece and shoved it in his mouth. As he was chewing he said, \"You know, I had chicken from here earlier today with no problems\"  Looks like his taste buds suck! Then he said after swallowing it, he begrudgingly said that the chicken was a bit SOFT and he would remove it from my bill.   The waitress came back over to offer me a different dish but I declined and just asked for my bill. This place will never get on track if they continue to purchase \"pretend chicken\" and try to pass it off as the real thing. The \"manager\" need to be retrained or terminated. I saw they have a groupon to eat at their restaurant.....because they need business. I gave it two stars because the waitress was so nice. I wonder what is keeping people out of their restaurant?? Bad food? Bad management? The fish stinks from the head down. Don't eat here.",

So coming back from the beach thought it would be a quick easy stop for dinner. Except they dont have a dinner buffet at least not on Sundays oops. No worries i just went with the pad thai which as their menu states comes with thinner noodles than tradital pad thai. Not my favorite but the flavor and spice of the pad thai was delicious. Maybe one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Seriously if you like spicy you should give it a try. To me $15 is high especially when the majority of the dish is noodles and the shrimp were cheap small probably frozen. I'd go back with  a geoypon or if it was closer to $10 range.",

While i have been here many times for the buffet this review is for the selections off the menu. The Singapore Rice Noodle with yellow curry was really good. Plenty of flavor and satisfied my craving for noodles. Plenty of both shrimp and chicken. The shrimp were good but the smaller ones. We also had an order of the Pad Thai which used the same noodle I believe.  Loved how spicy it was and the waiter even asked beforehand if we were okay with it being spicy : I believe prices could be a buck or two less but will say that they give you plenty of food. We even had leftovers. Service was great and really enjoyed coming here. Will be sure to be back on another Sunday during lunch buffet hours and will update my review then.",

The entire reason that I lunched here is because my friend, Deanna, told me that it was such a good place for Chinese food. She has been going to this restaurant for 35 years.  I had the chicken steamer, which was okay.  The iced tea did not taste home brewed; it tasted stale.  Overall, nothing to write home about. I compare all Chinese food to the Chinese restaurant across the street from South Park Mall (Baudin?).   That steamer is much better there.   The Great Wall of China South was a big space with few patrons.  The patrons that I passed when we were leaving the restaurant were talking about the sanitation scores.   We gave each other a nod of disapproval.   I think this restaurant may be surviving on their legacy of days gone by.  In order to be great, they will need to up the quality of their food, update their decor, and correct their low sanitation score. I will give them a shout out for having decent service. Our server was pleasant and efficient, but just couldn't make up for the low sanitation score. This restaurant has their work cut out for them, but anything is possible.  I hope they make it because I know they are a treasured establishment in this part of Charlotte.  Deanna told me so.",

    "text": "Our friends invited us here for dinner  as they have been patronizing this restaurant for 11 years and really enjoyed the Chinese food.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and  the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.  The waiter we had didn't crack a smile and was very serious throughout the whole dinner service,  never asking if we enjoyed our food or if needed anything else. He was not friendly at all as were all the other servers we noted.  However the owner of the restaurant came and greeted our friends and seemed very friendly and happy. The menu is very nice with typical Chinese dishes and also chef's specialties Vegetarian, healthy dishes and   childs plates also are included in the menu.  The portions are very adequate, prices moderate and the food came out hot and plated very nicely  All  of what we ordered was very tasty.  Our orders included , egg drop soup , hot and sour soup,  wonton soup.  Our main courses were the kings tofu dish   a mixture of tofu,  chicken   shrimp and mushrooms,  a great wall  triple delight,  with chicken and seafood and a  spicy  curry chicken .  We also ordered brown rice instead of white rice and an eggroll as an appetizer for one. Soups were standard basic recipe as well as the egg roll but the dinners really very good  as far as sauces and seasonings. Fried rice would cost extra if desired We would certainly return to try other dishes and hope to get a friendly server next time.",

The food was really good. I sampled some of everybody's which is why I don't know what I had an allergic to. Ughhhhh. About 30 minutes to an hour later once I reached home I started itching profusely and then came the welps and bumps. Luckily I had some Benadryl on hand(life of a Mom). Hopefully I'm not getting any food allergies in my \"old\" age. But overall imtge food was good. Family loved it. It was really empty tonight, maybe about 10 people including my 4 but hey it's a Tuesday right??!!!! And Tuesday's are all about Tacos...maybe next Tuesday I'll stick to Tacos",

Lunch is very affordable and dinners, although a little more expensive, easily feed 2 - 3 people. The food is consistently tasty and service is okay although sometimes a little moody.  Dining area is a little dark yet roomy. A more authentic Chinese menu is also available, intended for its Asian guests but can be requested by anyone.   You can be comfortable ordering anything as everything is good. Request table beside aquarium if available. I find their spring rolls very greasy. This place is. . Not a Gotta Try but close.",

When our food arrived, which took forever, it tasted like fresh food had been mixed in with leftover and reheated food and none of the three meals we ordered were hot. They were barely lukewarm at best. Pieces of my chicken were really rubbery and there were hard, crunchy bits of rice in my steamed rice. The sauce was very tasty though and the broccoli was crunchy and dark green, it was probably the best part.   If they served fresh food that was hot, they'd have gotten 5 stars and won repeat customers but cutting corners and being cheap will always cost you in the end.",

    "text": "Its been about four years since I have been to Great Wall, reading a lot of nice reviews about them. I liked them back then, but I was not too happy yesterday. We had a party of eight, and two babies. We ordered a lot of appetizers and lots of drinks and entrees. Our bill was over 250.00  To start out, our waiter was not very happy nor attentive, but the restaurant was basically empty. He had no expression and when I asked him about certain dishes, he did not have much to say. We started out with Scallion Pancakes, which were very good. Crab Rangoon, hard fried and not much of anything in them, Pot Stickers, they were fine. Next for the Entrees, we ordered the Green Beans, I think there was just Hoisin sauce poured on them, off tasting, Two orders of Moo Shoo Pork, it was pretty good. Chicken and Broccoli, Chicken in Garlic Sauce, Steamed Chicken and Veggies, and Special Beef. A order of Vegetarian Fried Rice, and also Deep Fried Tofu. We had a couple of beers, wine, sake, cold and hot also. So everything was just mediocre. The hot chili sauce was so old there was no heat left in it and it was just on the verge of being thrown out. I liked my Chicken in Garlic sauce, but not enough to make up for Old tasting Fried Rice, and just not anything else that was outstanding. I was the one who suggested this restaurant, I guess you cant go on old reviews and memories of days past. I would not suggest it again....",

I like the atmosphere since it beings me back to the days of my upbringing.  Instead of a \"take out\" place with a few tables and chairs, Great Wall is more of a \"sit down\" place so I can eat without people trasping in and out.  My dear Daughter was with me and we were both pretty hungry.  They gave us a typical lunch menu with the combinations which include rice and an egg / spring roll.   I ordered the Beef and Broccoli, fried rice and an egg roll.  The Beef and Broccoli was typical and tasted great.  The egg roll was really tasty, not sure what was different about it, but tasted great.  My daughter has celiac and needs special accommodations and the waitress was very understanding and we were able to create a special meal for her.   Great Wall does a great job and we've not had a bad meal there.  I recommend it.",

The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chicken/cabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back.",

They charged us 18% tip on the total bill (food +tax) plus 18 percent gratuity which makes no sense when waitor can't ask you how's the food or do we need anything else.

My husband and I both worked in the restaurant business during college and know about good customer service. For the food: My husband had some sort of beef dish with peppers and onions and I had the chicken and broccoli. Both dishes were very hot which was the only redeeming quality, but were incredibly generic. Nothing stood out about them whatsoever. The spring roll served with the meal was probably the worst Ive had so far. Very bready and not fresh tasting like you would expect a spring roll to be. Wont be back. Theres too many other places with great food and good customer service!",

    "text": "We were looking for a good Chinese place and I saw the reviews for Great Wall of China.  We decided to try it on Sunday after church. It  looked like it might be crowded with all the cars in the parking lot but when we got in the restaurant was bigger than it looks and it didn't feel cramped at all. Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet.    The inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars, and large fish tanks and a bit of flair from the 80's.  One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb is the absence of sound. It honestly felt like family dinner time after report cards came out. Besides the occasional cough and banging of fork on the plate that was it. My wife and I actually felt uncomfortable holding a conversation above a faint whisper. Don't know what the deal was with that maybe the other customers were regulars and were used to the \"no talking while you eat\".  The food was average. It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce.  I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about.  At least the service was good. I noticed on someone else's review, they mentioned the service is a little over bearing at times. I couldn't take a sip of tea with out him trying to refill it.  All in all it was a very bland an QUIET lunch. Maybe since it was on a Sunday the food was a little below par, I'll have to try it again and order off the menu and see how it goes.",

There are much better Chinese places around...",

Food has always been good and is always consistent.  From the egg drop soup to the spring rolls to the entrees, everything is great.  I highly recommend the Shrimp and Broccoli, but really everything there is worth trying.  Wait staff is very attentive, bordering on too attentive at times.  Food comes out fast and hot.  The owner is friendly and enjoys chatting.  Good with large parties, there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your party.",

I mean who doesn't like Chinese Buffet?? Especially because you are not expecting a high caliber of food, you are just expecting to eat a lot of the common Chinese food.  The next time I went was for a lunch on Saturday. And honestly there is nothing special here. The service was lacking, the check was dropped off right after the food. The place did seem busy, which I think is because of the groupon.  The food is seriously lacking. It had a small menu with the classic \"Chinese-American\" fare. When the food came out I was unimpressed. My hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor. The shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp. It is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant. There was not one thing that I would even recommend to anyone. It was all so blah. They bring out these dishes in the beginning of fried won-ton pieces. First, that is so cheap, but also it made me nervous about the cleanliness of the restaurant... Do they wash the bowls, or just refill the bowls?   Also, the place is kind of dark, I think it needs a good overall cleaning.",

The ladies went ahead and I parked the car. The hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together. I know they just walked in ahead of me. I spotted them in the corner.  First impression: the place is old and in need of some updates. It was really dark inside. There were far too many employees on staff for a restaurant with so few patrons.     They sat us at a booth in the corner.  Our table was served the traditional bowls of watered down hot mustard and pink duck sauce...  the fried noodles were too done almost burnt, a disappointment.    We had four people at our table. I ordered Hot and spicy scallops, fried rice and an egg roll.  Two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls. One ordered chicken with cashews fried rice and an egg roll. The hot and sour soup was delicious and just the right temperature.   When the food arrived, the portion sizes seemed correct and the fried rice was tasty with egg, peas and pork pieces in it.  I'm sad to say that the rice was the best part of our plates. One person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered. The waitress did offer to get the fried rice.  My scallops were undercooked and stringy and mushy, I could tell they were almost done but just barely edible. It tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt.  The egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt.    The aquarium was nice and we enjoyed it for a few minutes on the way out. I had eaten here before and it was much better in the past. So they Great Wall is not so great. Maybe just have some soup for lunch. Sad to say I won't take friends here again.",

She was rude and annoyed by my and my boyfriend's simple requests (like asking for chopsticks). My boyfriend waited until he paid to speak to the owner because he didn't want anything to be taken off the check or to be given to us for the poor experience. The owner listened to us, apologized and thanked us for our feedback but as we were leaving, this lady who I'm guessing was a manager comes out with the server and starts to tell us that the server just came from Thailand and that she did nothing wrong, that she was kind and that everything was okay. We didn't understand why this was happening. We were explaining to that manager what had happened while the server that served us was in the back cleaning off our table making snide remarks in her language and sighing. This is when my boyfriend really got annoyed and told the lady \"the service was bad, the food was good but she doesn't know how to serve.\" To the owner, we hope that you can get employees that know the importance of respecting your customers and not to harass them as they are leaving after giving feedback about the service that was provided to them.",

When we got there we were told that her name was mixed up with another woman, and that we would have to be seated in the main dining room. Not a big deal, but when you're told one thing and get another it's not the best way to start a meal.   We ordered the crispy scallion pancakes, which were very good as an appetizer, and you get crispy noodles and sweet sauce for the table. I got the chicken lo mein for my dinner. Everyone else's food including mine, looked great, except for my sister-in-law. She was trying to be healthy and ordered tofu. Thinking she would get some vegetables, she didn't ask what else it came with. Let me tell you, it was only tofu, in some sort of brown sauce. It did not look very appetizing.   I thought for the  amount people that were there, it took a little long to get our food, but once it came out I was more than happy. We were also able to use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift card, but also know that the tip is added before you pay when you use one.

Shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer. Broccoli was.. chewy? Did not realize that the fried rice would come with pieces of pork, but it did, so watch out my non-carnivorous friends.   Also, apparently, in this part of the country, an egg roll is just a super fried version of a spring roll. Had no idea, I was imagining those spring rolls you get at Viet places, wrapped in rice paper, fresh.   Food took quite a while to come out, and no one brought us fortune cookies. If I'm going to have Americanized Chinese food, I want my fortune cookie. and now I'm craving fortune cookie. Dang it!  I suppose this is a great place for lunch, but only if you aren't familiar with real, good, Chinese food. I'm so sad right now.",

I loved the huge fish tank they had on display. From there, sadly, it began to go downhill.   A lady at the bar waved me to the dining room, and a waiter sauntered over to ask what I wanted to drink. Also he asked me if I wanted a menu......strange. After getting settled with the menu, I ordered 2 egg rolls, hoping that since it was between mealtimes I would get freshly fried ones. Nope, not to be. Cold, hard and greasy. So back they went, with a request for fresh ones, told the waiter I didn't mind waiting for them.  I ordered Sa Cha Scallops as an entree, with a small pork fried rice. The new egg rolls came out at the same time as the entree. I could deal with that, no probs. BUT....egg rolls were NOT fresh, they were warmer, and just as hard. Scallops were good and plentiful, presentation was good, fried rice was good also. The egg rolls were the turnoff.   I'm giving it 2 Yelp stars, but if you love good egg rolls, don't come here expecting to find them. Panda's Den in north Charlotte puts this place to shame.",

The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the \"Steamed Veggie Dumplings\" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The \"Crab Rangoon\" is okay. The \"Spring Rolls\" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the \"Sa Cha Scallops\" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back",
