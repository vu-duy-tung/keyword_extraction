The waitress was not knowledgeable about the handful of Gluten Free items on the menu. In fact I had to tell her that something was actually GF even though it was marked on the menu. I ordered the GF chicken tenders which were slightly warm. The water had a funny taste to it so I ordered a coffee with cream and sugar. She brought cream and equal and no spoon to stir my coffee.  I ended up asking the bartender for sugar which they had to go find because there was none behind the bar.   Very disappointed with the food and service.",

I didn't even give them a second chance at it. It's an Irish Pub. If you can't make a decent Reuben why have food at all. I had to eat something though so I went for fried mozzarella. That was awful as well.   The waitress, Lauren, was extremely nice and very apologetic about the Reuben. Her service was excellent.  On another note...  I was in town for a concert. My friend called in the early afternoon to see if they had anything going on there pre concert and they said no. Turns out the local radio station was having an event there for the concert.   I also received an email today that this establishment also failed to check me in through my OpenTable reservation.  HORRIBLE!!!",

I've been trying to get a refund of my ticket price because I didn't get even close to my money's worth due to a dangerously over capacity crowd, a glassware shortage, slow bartenders, and a \"breakfast buffet\" that never materialized.  I've been trying to resolve this issue with the manager, Mike Palmer, and all he did was offer me a coupon to return and \"give Fitzgeralds another try\".  The problem is that I don't want to go back and eat/drink in an establishment like Fitzgeralds.  I would simply like either the manager or the owner to call me, which I've requested at least a half dozen times since the event, but I still haven't heard from anyone.  Even if there is no refund, I would still like them to answer simple questions like why were the bartenders overserving patrons that night (I routinely saw single customers order 4 or more drinks at a time), how many tickets were sold vs. the max capacity of the venue, and what officials witnessed the crowd that night and deemed it safe to continue selling tickets or letting patrons enter the building.  Very dissapointing customer service, very irresponsible way to run a bar/restaurant.  Very upset customers.",

Our drinks were served up by great bartenders, the people were fun and not rowdy, and best of all, we weren't molested by weird dudes all night wanting to grind up on us. Secondly, we were treated like queens by the the regular Saturday night DJ that night as well. He took our requests, had shots with us and treated us like we were regulars. Most DJs in the city won't give you the time of day, but Botz was great, he really made our night. We have been back on Saturday night ever since and have had the same great experience.

Drinks made by a female bartender was good and the energy in the bar was fun. The next nite(sat) b/c we enjoyed ourselves the nite before, we invited another friend to experience this bar. Well this nite was horrible, a bartender by the name of Justin was so RUDE and COCKY all b/c I asked him for a lil bit more liquor b/c the drink was SUPER weak. I asked him very politely and he told me(paying customer), \"the drink wasnt weak b/c he made it\". My friend and I were in shock how bold he was.  Unless he tasted my drink, how could he tell me how it tasted? He refused to add more liquor, but he did add some nasty behavior along wit his sidekick wit reddish hair. They proceeded to embarrass me, the one w/ the reddish hair LIED and told a bouncer that I said things that I didnt say. A supposedly mgr on shift definitely wasnt any help and didnt care to provide humble customer service. So basically they called a bouncer to have me removed fr the bar all because Justin's ego was shot. Before I left, the so called mgr(didnt get his name) added a bit more liquor after I asked numerous times for a refund for the drink I didnt drink. Because I didnt want to escalate the situation into a physical altercation, I left the drink and the bar feeling disrespected, embarrassed, pissed,etc. I refused to allow how I got treated untold. So this is my first time EVER writing a review because I felt the treatment was so unnecessary. Justin must think thats he's the best bartender in the world and cant make a weak drink..so he lashes out like a spoiled brat b/c his drink wasnt satisfying. But to put the icing on the cake, I saw a couple days later that they had the audacity to still CHARGE my card and a full cup of weakness was left on the bar. But please believe they will refund my money b/c Im not gonna get treated like this by these barbaric men.  SHAME..SHAME..SHAME",

There was a table of Tennessee fans that were so upset they lost their game that they profusely badgered at the workers for reasons that were entirely irrelevant. They were so intoxicated it was embarrassing. The waitress kept a smile on her face and was as polite to them as she was to us. We came in for cold beer, good food and a smile on their face to finish off our weekend in town. Approximately half way through their meal, just as we were having our food delivered, they asked for their checks. As we were eating I couldn't resist the urge to eaves drop on the conversation going on next to us. Like many restaurants, there is a policy instilled on larger parties where the restaurant is allowed to apply a service fee to ensure that their server is given an appropriate tip for their service to the customers, which was applied to our larger party as well. Once receiving their bills I heard them complaining about the attached fee. The manager was called over as soon as the waitress was aware of the situation at hand. The manager informed them of the policy and once again the table was nothing but disrespectful and the least bit understandable to the point where they began raising their voices and causing a bit of a scene. The manager was very polite and I was baffled by the way she was able to maintain her composure throughout the entirety of her conversation with the disgruntled customer. I, myself, was beyond impressed with the amount of professionalism portrayed by the employees within the establishment throughout the conversations that took place and my loss of words for the blatant disrespect of the fellow customers. I will definitely be returning to the bar for a delicious Juicy J and buffalo chicken dip! Thank you for finishing off a great weekend with my friends and family.",

I think that is a nice convenience and a good idea. Seems like they have some decent drink and food specials. Lots of space.   I like it.  Also, they have a decent selection of Irish whiskey.

    "text": "As someone who's uncle owned an Irish Pub back in the day, I am so trying to like this place.  After a bad experience a couple years back I decided to give it another try.  What I experienced on a Saturday night was deplorable.  Just as before, the service was anything but the friendly, welcoming atmosphere that goes with real Irish pubs.  Bartenders don't have to have a big phony smile but neither do they have to act like taking a simple drink order for one person is a huge, painful ordeal.  Then, as I was watching a closely contested sporting contest on one of their TVs, the place without warning turned into a cheesy dance club complete with unnecessarily risque and provocative images across the TV screens and songs with distasteful lyrics.   This type of objectification of women has no place in an establishment that advertises itself as an Irish pub.  Not surprisingly, it seemed to attract some low level rift raft with poor manners and objectionable attitudes.  After a previous bad review, management did respond and asked for some feedback.  I'm ready to offer that now.  My feedback is this.  Close this place down!  Right now!  Okay that's a bit extreme.  How about then changing the name at least away from an Irish Pub?  As a gesture of goodwill, I'm come up with a number of suggestions for a new name.

But now that it's patio weather this place should definitely be on everyone's radar.  Stopped in  a small bite on the patio on a Sat afternoon. The wings were HUGE and delicious. We had the blackened parmesan and the the barbalo. I would recommend either depending on what you like. I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full after 4 of them.   The waitress was on top everyhing. We always had a full drink in front of us. Looking forward to my next a on their patio.",

Well, imagine or surprise when at 7:40, we still had no food and worse yet, no sympathy from our waitress. It took us telling her that we needed food or we were leaving for her to finally produce something from the kitchen. The food that came out was worse than the service... Pitiful turkey sliders with a smear of browning guacamole on top that looked like snot, rubbery boneless chicken wings and cold fries. The only thing I'd consider eating again is the fried mozzarella (hand cut & breaded according to the menu). Needless to say, we will not be back and advise you fine folks to stay away! There are way too many fantastic restaurants nearby (Merts, Roosters, BLT Steak, etc. etc.) to suffer through Fitzgeralds.",

This place was so fun. We arrived about 30 mins before the game not knowing how busy it gets. We couldn't find a table but we found a good little area to pop up shop for the game. The bartenders were efficient and friendly. The patrons were equally nice. One guy even gave up his barstool to let me sit down. If you're in Charlotte and love the black and yellow, head here...just get there early!",

I should be writing new reviews for the new places that I've been but I have to give a shout-out to Lauren S, the manager who reached out quickly after my previous rating.  Me and some peepz happened to be in the area so we dropped in to grab a few more drinks... opera at the Belk would've been pretty sweet, but $3 vodka happy hour wins when one is slightly already inebriated.  With no fat lady in sight, the night had just begun.    But this review is just over.  The place was really solid and the staff was perfectly fine.  Great service recovery.    dmo out",

    "text": "Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! I've only lived in Charlotte a few months and luckily I found this place not long after moving. The friendly staff already know my name and the bartenders are quick to ask me for a drink if they haven't poured my favorite already. Fitz is my go-to spot before or during Hornets games. Right in the heart of Uptown, you really feel the excitement on game days since Fitz is just a short walk from the newly re-named Spectrum Center. Great spot for any and every football game as well, college or professional! Fitz has a plethora of TVs always on the most popular games and great appetizers and entrees to enjoy during all 4 quarters.  Just save yourself the trouble of trying to decide what to order and grab a Fitz Platter-- wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, sliders, and fried pickles. Also grab an order of buffalo chicken dip, you won't regret it. Fitz has one of the best reuben sandwiches I've ever had, but if you're feeling bold, try the Shillelagh burger-- a burger with a reuben on top. Guy Fieri would be proud. Nice drink specials daily, $6 burger lunch on Thursdays, and if you're looking for a late-night spot Uptown, Fitz has you covered there as well! Trivia every Wednesday night and DJs Friday and Saturday nights. Noticed one reviewer knocked Fitz as being \"the place everyone goes for free.\" Hmmm.... why would you not? Fitz is one of the largest bars in Uptown and forces no cover on you for entry. Of course I'd rather go to Fitz for free, instead of paying $10 to get inside a place smaller than my bedroom like The Local or Connolly's. That's just common sense, and not a negative but a positive for Fitz in my opinion. Fitz has enough room to be a bar, dance floor, and dining room all at the same time if it wanted. While being there, I've seen several rooms reserved for private events like after work happy hours at a private bar, or one of the dining rooms reserved for a big game watch party. If you're ever looking for a nice event space, I'd definitely recommend giving Fitzgerald's a call. They have plenty of room to accommodate your needs.  Bottom line: Fitzgerald's has everything I'm looking for in a local pub and more. 10/10 will go again!",

Downey Jr., North Dakota for the wedding of two of my friends and decided I was in the mood for something to eat during the day before the wedding.  The idea of food in general is below me, there is literally no point.  In the literal sense. Literally.  You consume it only to need it again shortly.  I usually consist off a diet of heavy trade winds I keep in bottles and Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel (which doesn't count as food), so this is unusual indeed.  My comrades wanted authentic Irish and that is indeed what Fitzgerald's served up: Nachos with sour cream and chicken and guacamole, Fajitas with Beef and lettuce, and of course the staple Irish dish, a delicious cinnamon-sugar churro with a Corona Light to type it all off.  Baba O' Riley indeed!  If you're in the Charlotte area looking for authentic Irish look no further than Fitzgerald's for genuine and authentic Scottish food.",

Not sure if this is just a game day thing, but they have beer towers (~100 oz of beer in this cute little dispenser) of Yuengling, Miller, Blue Moon, etc for $20-22!!!!! That's like 6-7 beers right at your disposal! I've never seen this before so I think it's pretty neat. All the booths have TV's with the games playing that are built-in, which is also super neat.  As for food - it's pretty decent bar food. The boneless wings are good and I've also had the Carolina burger. Not very Carolina-y or particularly tasty, but good enough. Sweet potato fries were pretty standard, a little soggy. The atmosphere is pretty fun for night games - there was a DJ playing good tunes and we were partying everywhere. Overall a good place to watch football games and have fun.",

We got a booth and & started to check out the menu. I forgot how limited the late night menu is here.  We ended up getting a order of fried cheese & chicken tenders.    I gotta say, the fried cheese was just terrible! Not only did it have the appearance & consistency of frozen crud, it also tasted as if it had been fried in old oil that had been used to cook fish.  Yuck! It was so bad that  Tim sent it back & he never does that!  Thankfully the chicken was much better in texture & flavor - no yucky fishy taste.  The sauce was meh though - I got BBQ sauce and thought it was too thick & just didn't have a great flavor.   The service was pretty good and we did not have to wait long for food or drinks to come out. All in all, a good place to go for bevvies but they could stand to make improvements in the late night menu.",

There was also a large selection of draft beers on tap and you could order special layered beers too like snakebites and Black and Tans.   We tried the fried pickles, Chicken sliders and fries. Others in our party enjoyed the kabobs, Mac and cheese, spinach, mashed potatoes and a wrap. We all enjoyed our food and the portions were very plentiful. If we had not been staying in a hotel we would have leftovers for the next day.   The fried pickles were specially good and very reasonably priced at $6. The pickles were thick cut, breaded with corn meal and served with ranch dressing.   They also had a new cocktail list that looked good. I tried the Gaelic punch (they couldn't make my first choice) and it was so delicious I ordered a second.   Overall, the food and drinks were good, as was the service.

    "text": "Let me tell you about an amazing experience that went south because of a bartender at this establishment. I came to Fitzgerald's in Friday afternoon, March 16, with some friends. We had an amazing bartender, Tom, and I had a very enjoyable time. So, when a few friends suggested returning there on March 17, saint patricks day, it was a no brainer for me. The music was amazing, the drinks were flowing, and the people were beyond words. I was having an amazing time. The food at this place is good, so i decided to order some French fries and chicken. I asked the bartender how much the chicken  was, and he told me it was $10. I had the fries earlier, so I knew they were $3. When I got my bill, $16, I asked what happened. Simple math shows that $13 plus tax isn't $16. Now, it isn't a lot of money, but everyone works hard for what they spend, and when you ask about pricing, that's what you expect it to be. He scoffed at me and said \" what, am I suppose to know the price of everything here?\"  This idea is a novel one as he is an employee. Nonetheless, I paid the man, moved on, and tipped the bartender that bought me ketchup.  That's when it started. I waited for 25 minutes for a drink as he literally served everyone around me. When I called the other bartender, the one I had previously tipped, he told her not to serve me and then she refused to take my drink order. It took a stranger walking up and ordering my drink for me to get one. I would like to note that I was the ONLY African American in that area at the time. When another gentleman(African American), he also had to wait a long time for this bartender to pay him any attention. I digress. When I finally got his attention, and I said to him \" hey, I've been waiting a while to order a drink,\" he made a vulgar motion  to me and then said so what, and carried on. Truthfully, I would like to say that this is the worse part, but it's not going to be. I plan to call a manager on Monday, but let's face it; they won't do anything about this. I even mentioned it to a manager there at the time, and he said \" I don't know,\" and then kept walking. The other major issue is that this is a common occurrence here in Charlotte. I find that establishments such as these aren't held to the same standards of good customer service and DECENCY that I am used to back home. Does it disgust me that he treated his African American clients so poorly?  Does it disgust me that even after reporting it and writing a review, nothing will come of this?  No!  What disgusts me is that establishments no longer care that their people treat all other people as simple human beings. This was my first time to Fitzgerald, and sadly, it will be my last!!",

I was really surprised to see all of the space that they have because it doesn't feel big from the outside.  We basically just had beers and apps.  I expected a broader beer menu with some local choices but that wasn't really the case.  Nonetheless, the beer special of the night was $3 pints.  That's totally acceptable.  The only food we got was pretzel bites.  They came with queso and beer mustard.  Overall, I was pleased.  It was a pretty big basket and we were certainly satisfied.  The service was hit or miss.  Our waitress was pretty flighty.  I would return to Fitzgerald's.  It's not terribly fru-fru which I appreciate.",

And I really like that they validate parking after 5pm - a rariety in Uptown!  The happy hour is full of variety with plenty of options.The nachos plate is huge and definitely something to share. Smaller apps, like the ahi tuna or chicken fingers, are great for single serve. The only thing I've ever been turned off by has been the fried pickles. They taste as though they are simply tossed in flour and fried til brown... no seasoning to really speak of and a lack of flavor. But everything else is good to snack on!  My only complaint, and the reason for the 3 stars, is the service. I've been here no less than a dozen times and each time I typically get mediocre service and a few times, just down right rude servers. Coming from the service industry, if you are busy, no problem and I get it.   One insistance my friends and myself traveled to Fitz to start our Saturday night. The server was busy, which caused for slow service, but was friendly and you could tell she was trying. The manager James saw my friend in a birthday tiara and served us a round of shots - props to James for being awesome sauce! I still go here a good bit but know that if I have somewhere to be at a certain point, I usually dine elsewhere.",

However, the decor has changed, but it appears to be the same old Buckhead crowd (those that have just turned 21 or maybe 22 and are ready to drink till they throw up).  This is a great place to drink, but I wouldn't recommend it as somewhere to enjoy a dinner.  The music is very, very loud and the patrons are usually extremely drunk.  I've been here twice and every time I sit at the bar someone ends up spilling their drink on me in some fashion :)  I went to watch a Panther's pre-season game, but with the dj playing it really wasn't a very memorable experience.  I figured that at 8pm on a Saturday, they'd have the sound on for the tvs, but there was a dj playing and he had the volume cranked up at full force.  Warning: The layout is kinda weird, so when there's a crowd, be prepared to push and shove your way through a sea of people to get to the restrooms (which are located at the very back).",

After standing around and waiting for someone to clear out, we were lucky enough to get a table near the dj.   Beer was expensive, as to be expected downtown, but the spectacles were ceaseless. That is a GREAT place to people watch and have some laughs with your friends. The music was far too loud though; it made everyone succumb to a shouting match.

This place has zero zing... zero. There is nothing special about it and no reason other than the free parking to have a drink or eat there. Their best drink special of the day, a $3 Blue Moon, ran out by 8:15 on opening night and it wasn't nearly as busy as I have seen the old Buckheads get. .   The first Blue Moon I drank had an overwhelming taste/scent of onion as if someone cut an Orange with the safe knife or cutting board as they used to chop onions...gross. I did ask the server about it and so my second (yes I braved another) actually tasted much better.   I ordered the shrimp entree for $11.95. This was definitely an appetizer portion. I was served ten shrimp which were not very large on an appetizer plate with a side of cut up onions with a dash of mealy tomatoes and three small pieces (half of my pinky size) of browned avocado. I couldn't taste the lime and it was very-much under-seasoned. Eating a plate of mushy onions was not appetizing and therefore it mostly remained untouched on my plate. I didn't complain because I already felt bad for the onion-beer complaint but it was fairly obvious my side wasn't touched. The food quality was unacceptable.   Service was ok for a first night and I'm sure she probably was more than a bit nervous. A more nuanced server might have thought to comp the first beer or notice my side was still glaringly on my appetizer/entree plate...but I won't fault her too much since it was their grand opening and therefore an expected learning curve.  I will say the place looked nicer than Buckheads which is definitely a plus. I hope they get better...a lot better.",

However, their remodeled interior was beautiful!  Instead of small tables used for standing only, there are full tables that can accomadate large parties and multiple new booths along the windows.  I was also impressed that for an uptown location, they offer free parking at a parking garage right next door!  Just make sure to bring your parking ticket into the restaurant so you can have them make a punch mark.    The menu is extensive and the pricing is reasonable ($7.95 and up).  I was disappointed that the only drink specials on their grand opening night was draft beer.  Bleh.  I took advantage of the $3 Blue Moon but by 8 PM we were informed that they had run out.  Not very good planning!  In the future, I'd like to try out their \"Luckitini's\" which are cutely priced at $7.77.    On to the food, as I mentioned, the menu is full of options.  A lot of it is typical pub fare like fish and chips, chicken caesar wraps, burgers, nachos, etc.  I sampled their sweet potato fries and had some of the beer battered fish and chips.  The sweet potato fries were cooked just like I love - not crisp but lightly coated with butter and salt.  The beer battered fish was quite tastey and came with a side of tarter.  The platter had 2 ample sized pieces of fish so you'll walk out full!  The service was attentive.  We were immediately greeted when we walked in by multiple hostesses and our server checked in often.    If you are looking to watch a game, you won't be disappointed.  There were TV's in every direction I turned my head.    Overall, Fitzgerald's gave me exactly what I expected.  I wasn't disappointed but it didn't leave me feeling like it was anything special.  I was hoping for somethng different, and unique in uptown Charlotte instead it is a cookie cutter pub.  I'd go back but I wouldn't say I HAVE to go back.  It's definitely a lot better than what it used to be so thanks Fitzgeralds for taking us up a notch!",

Servers were mediocre, but it is a new place and they are probably still learning the ropes (like how to pronounce the Irish beer Smithwicks properly).    I just wasn't impressed, at all.  When you put the name \"Irish\" in your name, I expect more than a place that serves Guinness... the decor is very sleek and modern, but there is nothing sleek or modern about a True Irish pub.  My Smithwicks was served in a glass advertising some cheap, American beer.    The food was OK.  I was impressed they had vegetarian chili on the menu, and it was quite tasty, but nothing stood out from any of the five people's orders in my party.  Overall, it's just a really generic bar that's not a sports bar, or an Irish pub, or anything at all that would stand out in a crowd.  It reminded me of a hotel bar... you know, the kind that is just kind of convenient, but nothing out of the ordinary?  Because they are a sponsor of my favorite sports team, I may give them a second chance, but all in all, it's a pretty forgettable and bland establishment.",

After walking around for about a half an hour trying to find a restaurant to grab dinner and drinks at before seeing a show at the Time Warner Cable Arena on a Sunday night we found Fitzgerald's which looked like an Irish Sports Bar with a great outside patio area.  We made our way to the hostess stand and asked if we could sit outside, the hostess looked very overwhelmed and wasn't even aware that there were tables outside hat were open. We made our way over to the tables and pushed them together and waited for someone to come clean them off - after about 5 minutes we sat down and pushed all the dirty dishes/glasses/checks to the end of the table. We had to go up and ask for a waitress twice and finally someone came over and took our order - leaving the dirty items and without wiping the table off. Our waitress came back a few minutes later to inform one of the members of our group that their beer choice was out, but didn't bring anyone else their drinks...  Our waitress then took our dinner orders and finally brought our beers, the member of our group who had who's original choice was out, received their drink with sentiment floating around and setting at the bottom...  Food was decent but the whole experience left a bad impression on all of us,I doubt anyone will return to this establishment if we are in the Charlotte area again.",

All of their burgers were on special: $6 for half pound burgers and $5 for third pound burgers. I got the half pound Gouda mushroom burger with a side of broccoli. I ordered it medium, but it came out very well done. It was a little dry, but overall pretty good. Nothing to rave about. I can't complain because it was only $6 (and huge!), but if I paid full price I would be a little let down. Tip: order your burger medium-rare if you want a juicy burger.   I recommend coming here when they have specials. Other than that it's your typical bar/restaurant so don't expect a 5 star meal.",

We were finally able to find a spot in Fitzgerald's parking deck and saw signs that they validate inside. Very convenient! When we got inside it was jammed pack and every table was taken and the bar was backed up and full but somehow we managed to get drinks in less than minutes. Kudos barstaff! My real amends goes to a female manger. My boyfriend and I were in awe of her work ethic. She found us a small table and bussed it herself. I was so worried the food would take too long and we would have to leave without eating but it only took 15 mins or so for three separate apps! Kudos kitchen! The manger came back around with some waters for us and she must have been able to tell by the panic on my face that I felt like I needed to rush and she held out her phone and showed me the concert schedule... JT didn't actually go on for another hour and a half! I was so thankful. I was able to relax and enjoy my food and drinks. While my boyfriend and I continued to sit there we watched as this selfless manager ran countless trays of food, bussed tables, bartended, barebacked stocking bar items, and handled manager duties with waitresses checks at their computer station. I mean I've never seen anything like it. All in all well done to the entire establishment. I take my hat off to your entire staff! We appreciate the hard work and excellent service. We will be back no questions asked!",

But as for late night, I had a blast. The dj was awesome and he had the videos playing to the music all over the bar. He played some great throwback along with top 40. There were good specials going on and the bartenders were really friendly. We just danced all night which is just what you need sometimes!   We loved it so much we got tickets to the NYE party!

    "text": "I've been trying to update some of my older reviews lately. While on the book of face today, I saw a flier for Fitz's three year anniversary party and thought it was time to re-visit this one.   Why this place wins: it's the closest restaurant/bar to TWC Arena AND they validate parking for the Wake Forest Garage. So, don't throw your garage ticket on the dashboard and remember to bring it inside with you. And when you bring it inside, don't forget to ask your server or bartender to validate the ticket for you.  Leaving the arena after a big event is always a pain, but especially know because of all the construction outside. I'll usually walk over to Fitz's for a drink after a game or show and wait for the traffic to clear. The patio is fantastic for people watching.  Menu-wise, I think the food has gotten better over the years. I usually order the Drop-Kick Chicken Sandwich. Buffalo sauce and bleu cheese make everything delicious. App wise I go with pretzel bites (beer mustard and queso dipping sauce FTW) and the wings. I mix hot and teriyaki sauces. I haven't had the chipotle mango, but it's next on my list to try.  Service can be hit or miss here. I've had good and not so good experiences here. This is a Penn State and Steelers bar. Steeler Sundays are nuts. Get there early. They also have IC Light for game day.  Looking at how this place has developed and changed over the past three years, I  would say this place is somewhere between a 3.5 and 4. I think they've earned that extra star.",

Unfortunately, this process was cumbersome - at best - since half the yuppies in Uptown were using the bar / stools / floor as space to lay their jackets / bags / laptops as they stand in crowds around the now-obsolete bar seating.  Once seated, I became a ghost.  Like a wind-swept trinket buried in the desert sands, the longer I waited, the more forgotten my existence.    I attribute this to a complete lack of professionalism on behalf of the server(s) who made little effort to actually work and maximum effort to socialise with friends at the bar.  Secondary to this is a hostess who, against all odds, exerted inhuman levels of apathy in rectifying this issue as it unfolded before her very eyes.

It's a great place to drink and they do have some good food on the menu, but the reuben is not one of those things.  I continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte with a place I thought would have a good reuben, an Irish spot. I was quite wrong. The corned beef was terrible - it was this rubbery substance that was clearly boiled, poorly, and didn't have any flavor at all. The sandwich was soggy as the standard marbled rye wasn't crisped up at all, and the kraut just didn't add much to the sandwich as it lacked the proper tartness required. The sandwich was covered in melted cheese, but that can only do so much to make up for the rest of a bad sandwich.  Fitzgerald's is a good spot with decent food and a great atmosphere - just don't make the same mistake I did and order a reuben.",

    "text": "I recently visited Fitzgeralds on a Friday night with some friends. When going to the bar to order, I saw that they had a special that read \"$3.50 Select Ales.\"  I ordered two, then watched as the bartender poured out two Miller Lites.  When she brought back the drinks, I explained that Miller Lite isn't an ale at all, but a pilsner (which is a style of lager.) She first asked \"What's the difference?\" When I explained the differences, she shrugged her shoulders and said, \"That's just what we call it,\" then walked off.  Beers can be split up into two categories: lagers and ales. Lagers (which include pilsners) use a bottom-fermenting yeast and have what the casual drinker would describe as a \"crisp\" taste, and ales (which include IPAs, porters, and stouts) use a top-fermenting yeast.   Even to the average beer drinker, this doesn't make sense. Getting a Miller Lite when you order an ale is like getting a tuna sandwich after you ordered the caviar.  At best, this is marketing laziness, at worst it's an outright lie.",

I came here on Thursday to give their burger lunch special a shot ... $6 1/2lb & $5 1/3lb burgers.   To start our meal off, service was extremely slow. I was in about 1:45pm, after the lunch rush already had gone through, so this was pretty disappointing in and of itself. When I ordered my burger, I made sure to ask the waitress if the burger \"temperature\" was True to order, as they're usually always more well than you order. She assured me it was very True to order, so I went with medium cooked 'Shillelagh'. Burger came out with not one speck of pink in it .. but service was taking so long I didn't even bother sending it back or I would have been going on a 1.5 hour lunch break. The patty was so dry it ruined the burger for me complete, I ended up just eating the corned beef/saurkraut off of it and leaving half the patty.  Overall, very disappointed with lunch, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a good burger. Maybe I'll give something traditionally Irish a try next time and hope for the best.",

The place is large but filled up quickly. They offer a big bathroom with lots of stalls which is nice. Our service was good. Our server was pretty slammed. We had a few Dos Equis Ambers and ordered some nachos (without chili)  and some pretzel bites. You get free pretzel bites with your Yelp checkin!!! The bites were okay and the nachos were amazing.

I felt pressured to make a decision so I just took the mahi tacos.  They were okay after the server brought me a few tartar sauces to doctor them up.   I was looking for a complimentary dip for my sweet potato fries.  The best she could offer me was a side of ranch dressing.  No cinnamon butter, honey butter, honey or anything like that.

The cheese stick things were ok but the breading was really over cooked as well. The crab dip one (which I didn't eat) the guys said it was good. Most people regardless of what they got they said it was ok not great. I got this bbq burger and it was over cooked I asked for medium and it was well well well done and cooked the flavor out of the food. I don't know what everyone got as I'm not going to ask everyone their opinions when several people have less than good responses. Someone got the black bean burger and said the same thing. One other person got something with shrimp and said it was really good which was kind of surprising. Our waitress was awesome but honestly that doesn't make up for the food quality.",

I called the bar earlier in the day and asked about reserving a booth for the game, they told me that they don't do that. Now keep in mind they don't know it's me who called and asked about reserving a booth. So me and the family are sitting there at a booth that we happened to lock down when we got there because it wasn't crazy packed this weekend and the party in the booth next to us leaves. So they clean the booth and put a reserved sign on the table. U wanna talk about pissed and I took a pic to prove it. I don't know who these ppl were and I don't care. If your gonna do it, do it for everyone. Stuff like that really grinds my gears, I don't know if I want to come back to this establishment after that. The food was really good here too. Smh",

So I'll comment on my experience with the staff.   We're do I start the staff was awesome the food was awesome. We ordered wings and potatoe skins. The buffalo kind I ordered were too spicy but the manager (I think) came over and kindly gave me the less spicy order for free and let us keep the fire ones. My friends ate those and loved them as well as the bar b que. I apologize for rating you on someone else performance and again I must say the staff once inside the bar were awesome. Therefore the next time I'm in Charlotte I'll definitely be stopping in. Awesome awesome bartenders and food annnnd DRINKS.",

Standard bar food; wings, dips, sandwiches, salads, etc. I didn't order any food, but a few took others did at the table did and it took forever and ended up getting compt.   I had their $3 mimosa which was so heavy on the OJ and not even a nice pour in the wine glass. I also got a bucket of bud light which was $25. $25 for a bucket really?....

Fitzgerald's is a sports bar with just enough of an Irish twist to peak my interest on game day. When I walked in, the main room was extremely spacious with generous TV coverage end to end. The owner, Kyle, immediately welcomed our party and had us seated quickly.   Once we found a nice booth area, he inquired on which Games we'd want to watch, and ended up letting us split our viewing to an array of matchups which was most welcome considering we're fantasy football fanatics.  Throughout the day, we had mimosas, which I have yet to find a rival in the Charlotte area for. Poured quite strong, however they weren't offputting considering the ratio of OJ to champagne. This is how ALL mimosas should look; brunch spots take note!  The burger I ordered was cooked to my exact specification, and had a sauce that was extremely zingy and unique. Huge fan and must find out what comprises this sauce!  Overall, the servers were attentive and personable, the food was exceptional, and the owner was a very kind and hard-working individual; often carrying plates to customers himself and mingling in between encouraging his staff.  This MUST be your fantasy football headquarters outside of your own couch and TV!",

The lunch special said $6.  When we received the bill it said $6.99.  Waitress said the sweet potatoes were an extra $.99 which she said was stated on the menu. It probably was but she should've told us because most people focus on the menu item and not added charges listed elsewhere.  The waitress had the manager remove the charge which was nice.  We didn't mind paying $6.99.  It was just the principle(sp).    So my bill comes to $6.50 with tax.  I give her $10.  She gives me $3 back.  What happened to the $.50?  I hate when they do that. So, of course I deduct the $.50 from the tip.    Wait, I have more.  My co-worker pays by credit card and sees a 4% service charge on her bill. Apparently because she paid by credit card?  Again, waitress said nothing.  Maybe it was in fine print on the menu? Who knows.",

    "text": "Fitzgerald's is the place to end up for many reasons. The first obvious reason is because they validate parking! All you have to do is buy a beer and boom your parking is paid for. A genius way to beat the high prices of parking around uptown. The parking lot you need to find is the Wake Forest deck, which is just down the street from it.   Another reason to stop here is if you are a Steelers fan (or Penn State). Game day here is the Steelers HQ. So weekends when there is college and pro football it's going to be a hopping place. Charlotte seems to have a LOT Of Steeler fans.   Throughout the week, Fitz has some really great deals including their burgers that go on special on Tuesday. Make it out for their pint night and play some trivia. They give away really awesome prizes!   Also make a pit stop before a Hornets game and buy cheaper food and drinks then when you walk into the stadium and prices skyrocket. Don't forget to enjoy their outdoor patio seating that's nice and perfect for watching the streets of Charlotte!",

    "text": "Was uptown for an event at the Spectrum Center this past Monday night, (yes, Monday Night Raw baby!) so decided to drop in for a bite to eat before the event, instead of paying big arena prices for small arena portions.    Upon walking in the front door, was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated without a wait which was nice as it was already pretty busy and people continued to file in after we arrived.  Was cool to see that it was family friendly, as there was a nice mix of groups, pairs, adults and families with kids there that Monday evening.    Our server was very pleasant with a constant smile and was attentive without being overbearing, which is always a plus.  Never had to wait too long for a refill or wonder if she was on break (we have all experienced the \"case of the disappearing server\" at some point), as she came around multiple times to check on us and make sure all was good.  The manager also came by at one point, which is always a nice touch, especially when they pitch in to help clear a table or remove dishes, as it shows a team approach which is always cool to see.   Usually not a fan of Irish pubs as I find the food selection to be lacking for the most part, but must admit that Fitzgerald's completely changed the paradigm as their menu selection offered a wide array of sports bar favorites like nachos and wings to the rarely seen warm crab dip to old Irish pub standbys like Fish and Chips and Reuben sandwiches.   Ended up getting the crab dip, an order of nachos and the free pretzel bites that was offered with the Yelp check in coupon (thanks Yelp!).  Crab dip was very good, as were the pretzel bites, while the nachos were lacking on the chili as the chip to chili ratio was waaaaaay off, so a miss on that one.    Overall, the friendly service, abundance of tv's, cleanliness of the restaurant, solid value, and great location (parking is validated with purchase), this was definitely a solid 3 1/2 start experience, but great service always gets a round up from me, so 4 stars it is.  Will definitely give it another try as the menu has tons of choices to explore and I am looking forward to checking out the drinks next time I am there as well.  Fitzgerald's, congrats on making me rethink my viewpoint of Irish Pubs as if they are like you, then I definitely will be giving them more of a shot in the future!",

The hamburgers will get you through the night of drinking, but there are far better places to eat within walking distance. Eat first and then come here.  SATAN'S BREATH burger is HOT...HOT...HOT!  You will pay that night and a day later. It tastes good and that makes up for the cold fries.",

The platter contains all my favorite things. Nice and hot too!!! Mozzarella cheese squares melted into long strips as you pulled it apart. The sweet and spicy wings were everything!!! Shout out to Paul Booker. Everyone should try the Mac and cheese plate. By far my favorite dish especially if you add salmon. Salmon was cooked to perfection. Shrimp Po boy was nice and crispy, full of flavor. Finished with a tiramisu cup life couldn't be sweeter!!! Thanks for the great service and experience Fitzgerald's.

Our server was pleasant and quick with the drinks.  She left about 15 minutes after we sat down, however, and things turned awful.  We were harassed by 3 different homeless people for money.  Granted, it's not Fitzgerald's fault that homeless people come up to people sitting on their patio. However, they didn't take an active role in getting the homeless people to leave until one actually went into the bar.  They care about themselves not being bothered and not the customers sitting on the patio.  Around 1am we were told it was last call and asked by a bartender if we wanted another drink.  By 1:10 our tabs were all closed but we remained on the patio talking and finishing our last call drinks. As with all drinking, we took turns going into the bar to use the restroom.  At 1:30am we were told that we couldn't go in and out of the bar (even to use the restroom).  At 1:45 we were told by a bartender that the bar closes at 1:30 and the sign in the window and google (which both say the bar closes at 2am) haven't been right \"for a long time.\" The entire time this was going on, the bartenders were sitting inside at the bar with a \"friend\" watching us. They were rude every time we used the restroom. They were rude about us being on the patio.  They were rude about picking up our glassware from the patio. At 1:55am they apparently got sick of waiting for us to leave and we watched as the bartenders ran up the street with the friend they were sitting at the bar with to make last call at another bar (which they told us they wanted to do earlier in the night).  The staff here do not care about this place or the perception their actions leave with the customers.  I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out $100 bills with every beer (which was only slightly above room temperature btw). There are far too many better options uptown to waste your time at a place that does not care about your business.",

Bad service and mediocre food again at best. Seems the same every time i go.  I like the servers and bartenders but not worth the money when there are much better places to go downtown for lunch or dinner. may still go here for late night as they do really cheap drink specials some nights but thats about it",

    "text": "We came in at about 4:30 and ordered the Friday Special salmon in dill cream sauce and sweet potato crusted chicken. Seating was immediate and service was prompt and attentive, personable, yet not obtrusive. We drank draft Harps while our food was prepared. I absolutely LOVE draft Harp. There's an added taste of the Irish Sea: a salty, mineral-rich freshness which I don't taste in the bottled version.      Our food came quickly and was absolutely AMAZING ! We expected bar food, and instead received high-caliber cuisine unmatched by anything I have ever eaten elsewhere. My fiancee used to dine at the Tower Club, and this food matches the food prepared by a chef trained by Julia Child.      We had recently had similar entrees at a regional winery, and this food was so remarkably superior it was mind-boggling. The rather large piece of salmon was cooked perfectly: moist flakes of juicy flesh melted in my mouth. The dill sauce was a perfect complement, letting the flavor of the fish shine.The chunky mashed  potatoes were marvelous: a burst of garlic flavor, followed by spicy deliciousness with a creamy lingering finish... like a fine wine, there was a complete sensory trajectory. The asparagus, we both enjoyed, evidenced the chef's New Orleans training. My fiancee's chicken was extraordinary: the combination of sweet potato, red peppers, onions and mango was spiced superbly (cinnamon ? allspice ?); the chicken was cooked to perfection: tender and moist.       Our dinner was rounded out with draft Guinness and chocolate chip cookies soft and chewy and fresh from the oven, served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce which married perfectly with the stout    The meal was so extraordinary that I did something I have never done, namely, ask the waitress to convey to the chef that this was the finest restaurant meal that I have ever been served. The chef, Deacon, came to our table and we were able to compliment him and his skill and thank him personally.      The decor, ambiance and service were fine. The food was EXCELLENT ! ( Odd to us how haters rate this place too loud and too quiet and ignore the Irish food on the menu !)",

We were there 45 mins & had to ask for our food, we never rec'd any refills on drinks. My fish was cold & It took 15 mins for me to get it back and it was just reheated. The microwave only takes 30 secs & the fish was just lukewarm. They could have at least given me a fresh one. I had asked for no mash potatoes & rec'd it anyway. The waitress told us that the special included honey glazed carrots, she was wrong. I found that out when I asked her why didn't I have carrots. She said that she forgot that it's asparagus today. Never asked me if I wanted or liked asparagus. She forgot the mac & cheese & when she brought it to the table she just laid it there and kept moving, no \"I apologize\" or an explanation. She never apologized or even looked at me when she brought the fish back to me either. The mac & cheese had some type of string in it. After poking & proding it, we still couldn't figure out what the object was floating in the mess of velvetta they call mac & cheese. She must have been having a bad day because it was written all over her face. The buffalo chicken sandwich had some shaved almonds on top of it. I assume it was supposed to be almond crusted, which wasn't on the menu. One of my friends had to go in the kitchen and get our ticket where she found the Mgr & the waitress chatting it up & laughing. She also hadh to stand over her while she closed out our ticket. She laid it down on the table and said \"Oh, he gave you a 15% discount for the food and stuff\". Really? He could have graced us with his presence. We were there an hour and 15 mins and there were only 3 tables ahead of us and they waited just as long as we did, some even longer. The Mgr never showed his face, unless it was the gentleman serving tables. I've heard the same complaints from other associates. They won't be in business long at this rate.",

Quite possibly the coolest MF I have ever seen, on par with Samuel Jackson, greeted me with a slight head tilt and a faint smile. This man was wearing sunglasses inside and shredding a Dj turn table while pumping soap and handing towels out. I was at the urinal vibing to no diggity down to my soul in the most epic piss I've ever taken. When finished I saw a collection of every candy and gum that you could imagine along with cologne, condoms, lotion, and raw unadulterated swag.

Despite it all the waitress was sweet and we tipped her well. Save your money!  Overall we have found some excellent food and service in Charlotte. Sauceman's for Barbeque was outstanding and 5Church was a great meal with top notch service. Each deserves their own review.   As for  Fitzgerald's Irish Pub?

The chicken sliders were very tough and hard to eat.

Steelers fans are one-of-a-kind and can be a bit much so hat's off to Fitz for being the official Steelers bar in Charlotte. I'm sure they catch a lot of crap but they handled it very well.

    "text": "Meh. That is the perfect way to describe Fitzgeralds.  The place is not all together bad, but with a plethora of both restaurants and bars in Uptown; why waste your time with this place?  I've been for both drinks and dinner and both experiences were truly 'Meh.'   The food itself is not bad, its bar food-- the same stuff you get at any bar and its good enough-- but when the food takes forever and comes out cold-- kinda makes it hard to judge the quality.  The servers also seem not too inept with when it comes to being attentive or really serving at all.  I am sure there are good servers, but my experience was not so.   My friends came before me and ordered their food at the bar.  When we got a table they told the waiter that they were going to go tell the bar-- he said not too, that he would close out their tabs and transfer their orders to the table.  This was clearly not done as their orders sat at the bar for about 20 minutes before they were brought to the table.  This was only after asking repeatedly for their orders (since all of us were pretty much finished ordering).  He assured them again and again that the kitchen was working on it and they were just backed up.  Finally, the waiter brought the orders to the table and simply explained, 'yeah, they were sitting up at the bar.' No apologies.  Judging by the ice cold french fries-- the orders were sitting there for a while-- which seems a little unsanitary to me . . .   So in conclusion, Fitzgeralds is MEH.  Go somewhere else.  There are PLENTY of bars and restaurants in Uptown-- several serving up the same kinds of food and atmosphere as this place.  For that reason, save your time, your money and your taste buds from an evening at Fitzgeralds.",

Since it was a Wednesday they were playing trivia, which probably starts somewhere around 9-9:30. We got there after the second round of 4, so we just played along, but not competitively, which was disappointing because they looked like they had some pretty great prizes.   On Wednesdays they have $3 drafts. They also have Woodchuck on draft, so I was pretty excited.   I ordered the chicken and cheese sliders, which have just chicken, bacon, and cheese. Doesn't that sound really good? Well it was. I ate 2 of them (they come with 4) and took the rest home for my husband to enjoy.   Nicolette ordered a massive burger with a lot of things on it, and a salad, that never came out. When she told our waitress, she immediately brought it out, and took it off the bill. It was a lot of food, but it was good for me because my sliders didn't come with a side, so I got to partake in Nicolette's fries. They were good, but could have been cooked longer, because they were kind of on the mushy side.   Overall, I had a lot of fun here, and if you can play trivia on a Wednesday, I would come out and have some fun!",

The drinks are pricy and the scene and crowd isn't quite as exciting as other bars in the area.  But it does have a great location. It's in great proximity to the Epicentre and the rest of uptown, and the friendly staff and good bar food make it just above average. Go for some wings and to catch a game and you won't be disappointed.",

I don't think I've ever had anything like it. Extraordinarily rich and decadent. Double layered. Thick, creamy mascarpone. Heaven on my tastebuds.  Can't wait to try the goatcheese burger!!",

    "text": "This place looked like a fun place to watch a game, but the service was a bit lackluster. We were sat at a table outdoors, but it took about 15 minutes for a server to clear our table and greet us. Even after taking the dishes away, there were still several cheque folders on our table from the previous party. For an Irish pub, the Fish and Chips were very average. One member of our party had sediment at the bottom of her beer, but they comped that beer, so they earned some points there. A lot of places in Charlotte were closing early that night for \"staff outings\", so we landed here as our third or fourth choice. I'll try a different dish next time. The pork sliders looked very good, as did the burgers.",

    "text": "I was never in here when it was Buckhead, but we stopped in Fitzgerald's over the summer for a beer before the Roger Waters concert.  A month or two later, I got a gift card as part of a silent auction package from the MS Society's Great Gatsby Gala.  What better day to use than when going to two events at the arena in one day?  We stopped in here for dinner between the Charlotte Checkers noon game and the Charlotte Bobcats 7:30 game.  I had the shepherd's pie which was probably the best version of this dish I have had.  The grilled asparagus as my side was very good too.  My friend got the Guinness battered fish and chips, and while he said that the fish (cod) was good, the fries and slaw left a little to be desired.  Our waitress was only okay; definitely not great service but not bad.  The place is huge so there is plenty of room for events before or after uptown events and it is really close to the arena.  If you drive, parking is free in the Wake Forest parking deck after 5pm. The only negative here is that they do not have a whole lot of beers on tap apart from Guinness and Miller Lite, but they at least have Fat Tire in bottles.  More local beer would make this a great place.",

    "text": "Now, I have to say I've only been here once for a Yelp event and I'm not sure if the chef that made our dinner is their house chef or a guy they brought with them... That being said, I'll comment more on the layout, service and overall vibe...  There is plenty of bar seating which likely makes this a cool place to come hang out... There's even a separate section with another bar up on risers and a dining area directly across from it... They do not have a way to cordon that off from the regular restaurant noise, though, so if you're trying to rent some space there, I would keep that in mind...   Their restrooms were pretty clean by Uptown bar standards and there were about 8 stalls, so I was definitely surprised and pleased with that... Normally, the lines are huge at a place like this, but that's got to help...   I'm going to tell you, the servers here were some of the best that I've encountered... Quick, frlendly and a lot of fun... They really seemed to want everyone to have a great experience and it showed...    They validate parking from the Wake Forest lot, so yay for that!  Who likes to pay for parking?  Not this lady...   I'll have to go back again to make sure the good food was really theirs, but I'll make sure to do an update when I get around to it!  Until then, this looks like a safe bet for some drinks and a nighttime hang...",

Even though Fitzgerald's replaced Buckhead's (a long time Charlotte staple since I've been here) I was taken aback at all the changes they made to the inside of the place.  They've classed it up a bit to make it much more than a bar... it's better suited for meals now.  It was funny being greeted by a hostess since I was just used to just going in and barring it up.  We were just planning on picking up tickets for an upcoming bar crawl, but we ended up eating dinner here.  The menu is quite large with some authentic Irish dishes.  I tried the Fish & Chips....  Usually I don't really expect much having been through my share of over-breaded, badly fried fish portions... but the breading here was nice and light with the fish perfectly cooked and moist.  The fries were nice a crispy too... way too many places present you with some cold, limp fries.  Lucky for us, Wednesday nights are Pint Nights!  all pints are $3 (with exception to Guinness... which made me somewhat sad).  It was still a good time.",

We sat at the back bar and were treated like family by Dina and Zane.  They totally hooked us up ;)  From the abundance of Steelers fans and flat screens, to the beer selection and great food, we felt welcome. They even played cool music whenever there was a commercial break in the game.  Garage parking is free and conveniently located right next door.  Will be back for sure!",

My bf and I sat at the bar in the back and the bartender was super sweet. She poured us great drinks and provided great service. I got the fried pickles (free upon checking in with a $5 purchase) and bf ordered fried mozzarella and side of fries. Soooooooo good. Seriously some of the best fried pickles I've ever had and they were lightly breaded so it wasn't so greasy! The fries tasted like Arby's curly fries minus the curly part. The fried mozzarella was some of the best I've ever had (& I love mozz sticks). These were in the shape of a triangle and had so much cheese in them. I would come back just for these. The atmosphere was great too, we were there right before a Charlotte Hornets game and it was crowded but not too packed. We had a great time and plan to come back!",

She also had no clue how to pour a B&T even though the spoon was right there next to the tap and other bartenders were using it.  Regardless my $9 drink tab was $19.50 when it arrived, the bartender headed for the hills so I just paid it rather than wait any longer.  As for the food, the Reuben was soggy but good.  Really liked the corned beef.  The blue cheese dressing was the consistency of milk with some tiny bits of something that I assume was flavorless blue cheese.  Too many other choices down there.",
