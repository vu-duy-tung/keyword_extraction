There is no way that it is better than the Qdoba across the parking lot. It's basically the same thing. But this is True of a lot of Mexican food - it seems like you pay double if it comes with a plate. Someone has to wash a plate. So maybe that makes sense.  3 people - no alcohol - no drinks (water) - no appetizer - 3 entries and the bill including tip was over $50.00. Fast food Mexican without the plate for the same meal would have been less than $20.00.  Maybe it will be better 6 months from now - I'll keep you posted !",

    "text": "I've tried making guacamole at home with everything Cantina 1511 uses for the tableside preparation, but it must be a mystery, because theirs is impossible to recreate. The menu is extensive and loaded with more choices than Netflix on a good day. The recent menu redesign has lots of bright colors and looks like a Post-It note cram session, prompting many bad memories (geology finals) and the waiter promising any kind of guidance with the menu/counseling for bad exam experiences. Service: 1. Redesign: 0.  The menu breaks down into different categories: comida autentica mexicana (which lists Mexican specialties in Spanish) and Tex Mex Standards. Picking out just a few tacos from the Magnificent Seven is tricky, but the pescado frito (fish) taco is pretty spectacular. I like the creative fish tacos or the carnitas, but the ancho chicken salad is my favorite. Tossed with chopped romaine lettuce and garbanzo beans, the flavors are familiarly Mexican, but the dish is fresh and just as filling as an enchilada. Prices are a little bit higher, reflecting a quality difference with other Tex-Mex joints, which I think is pretty justifiable.  The inside's a little noisy, but just like the menu, the paper mobile decorations and a banging Spanish poster of Gone With the Wind are a contemporary update of the Tex Mex cantina. Whenever I'm in town, my sister and I make a point to stop here.",

    "text": "Another place that is a local favorite that I am just not down with.  I will repeat what other reviewers have stated - overpriced.  Meaning, the exorbitant prices are not justified by the quality of the product or the experience.  I am perfectly content with Azteca, Monterrey, etc. - fair prices for a mixture of beans, rice and meat in some form of a tortilla.    On a Sunday at 11:30, there was a sparse crowd.  We were seated immediately by a guy who was rubber-banding crayons for kids (don't get me started - I am going to start eating at titty bars to avoid breeders and their ill-mannered spawn).  Our server was friendly enough, minimal chatting and kept the fresh drinks coming, so points for that.    The food: A small bowl of super-salty tortilla chips, from what I imagine was the bottom of the bag.  Mostly broken pieces, but the waitress did bring a new batch with mostly whole chips once she saw the basket of chip shards/dust.  Served with salsa, which I didn't eat any of to save room for the queso Queso - $9.50.  That's right - that's a 9.  Almost $10 for a crock of barely melted cheese and a few onions thrown in for texture.  You would think it would taste like cotton candy, sex and hundred dollar bills for $10.  Nope.  Cheese.  Just cheese.  And a couple of onion slices.  Served with warm flour tortillas to go along with our over-salted chips.  It's cheese, so I ate it, but it wasn't in my top 10 queso list.  Putting it in a small, fancy crock with a tea candle under it doesn't justify the 1000% markup.  Fail.   Carne Asada Steak Burrito - $12.75.  The burrito was HUGE, like took up half of the plate huge.  And while I am a big believer in the theory that size matters, this was a lot of burrito.  I noticed that it was served with slaw, lettuce, tomato, sour cream and guacamole on the side, and being used to the aforementioned mexican joints, I wondered where the rice and/or beans were?  They are stuffed in the giant burrito, along with corn, peas and carrots (?) and the steak (which was fine, nothing special).  It was good.  I ate about 1/3 at the restaurant and ate the rest for dinner.  It reheated well and was okay.  I had not been to Cantina for many years, the last time I went they cilantro'ed the shit out of everything after I had asked for no cilantro.  After yesterday's visit, it will be many more years before I return.",

The guacamole made fresh at the table was pretty good, I only wish it had some more tomatoes in it.  My meal was not very good - the chicken and spinach enchiladas.  They were really bland.  Not much seasoning.  I had to dump a bunch of salsa on they to even be interested in eating my meal.  The beans seemed like they were not totally cooked all the way, as they were sort of hard.     Quite honestly, I remember the food being better at the other location.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night?  Or maybe the other location is better.",

    "text": "My dining experience at Cantina/Stonecrest last week was above average, rating a 4 out of 5. While it was a Monday night, the restaurant was packed. I ordered a margarita at the bar while waiting for my friends and my table. Once we got seated, we joked about how no one wanted to wait on us because we looked like we were having too much fun. Finally, we got our chips and salsa (fresh!) and placed our orders.   I am totally addicted to nachos. The messier the better! And, it's great value at Cantina if you're watching your pennies, which I am!   The nachos that I ordered was a huge portion. Enough for two people easily. Fresh guacamole and sour cream was not spared in the least. I had to order jalapenos (forgot when I originally placed my order), but they were brought out quickly. Freshly sliced and spicy!   I order Tres Leches cake off the menu. It was dry with a whipped topping that I expected to be homemade and fresh, but seemed to come straight from a can.   Cantina is definitely one of my \"go to\" places. I loved how they can make a mean Jalapeno margarita if you ask them and if you're going out for Restaurant Week, make sure Cantina is on your list. Of all the places I've visited over the last few years during Restaurant Week, Cantina gives you the best for the value!",

It came with roasted tomatoes which were very oily in my opinion.  The tres leches cake is NOT like a traditional Mexican dessert. There's a marshmallow spread on top which makes it very sweet and takes over the whole dish.  Service was good and the food was ok.

    "text": "My husband brought me and my mom here for Mother's Day lunch as this used to be one of my favorite places as I loved their drinks. He made reservations almost a month in advance. When we arrived, there was an abbreviated, pre-fixe Mother's Day menu, which we were not made aware of in advance.  I was a little disappointed that I could not get the Barbacoa I'd always liked so much. We were initially a party of 3 and my son said he couldn't make it so we went ahead and ordered our food, After waiting a really long time and no food, my son suddenly appeared. We put in an order for him as well. After waiting another excruciatingly long time, a server appears with a plate of food. ONE plate. It was the dish my son had ordered. He arrived about 30 minutes after us, and got his food first. Since it just so happened that he and my mother ordered the same choice, he gave the plate to her so she could start eating as the server promised that the rest of our food would be right out. However, at the time that she FINISHED her plate and the rest of our food hadn't been brought out, I caught the eye of a hostess checking tables (as our server was nowhere to be found for long periods) and asked her to please check on the rest of our food. 5 minutes later, the rest of the food comes. My fajita platter - which was some dried out chicken and mushy peppers and a single flour tortilla, was cold. Not even lukewarm, but cold. I immediately had to flag down another hostess, again, our server was elsewhere for long periods, and asked her to get me a manager. Manager comes, apologizes for the \"kitchen\" mixup and says he will remake my meal. FIVE MINUTES later, I have a piping hot fajita platter in front of me, this time with TWO WHOLE flour tortillas. Yay? Nay. While it was hot, it was bland and unseasoned. Not sure how tex-mex ends up unseasoned. We were all so disappointed with this experience they completely ruined my mothers day luncheon. We are not interested in returning here again. Not even for the drinks.",

I once again asked to find out what is was. Really? I ordered it based in his description and it came out and was different than what he said. Normally, I'd send it back but was starving. Wasn't bad. It was mostly fish, we think. It included small potatoes croquettes, some type of cheese mini burrito, I think swordfish on a chip. We each ordered one taco, the crispy pork. I asked how big they were in case they were the small ones, I'd order two. His answer was \"regular size\".   I ordered it anyway and was a nice size and very flavorful. The rice and beans that came with it was DELICIOUS! I'd go back, but they need to school the staff on what the food is and their descriptions. I know a lot about food, but I'm no ethnic expert.

That is a True test when it comes to a \"mexican restaurant\" and Cantina definitely doesn't disappoint when it comes to their guac!  It is fresh, flavorful and spiced to perfection!    As far as everything else is concerned....it is just OKAY, in my opinion.  It is a trendy, mexican-fusion restaurant so you get what you pay for...and you pay quite a bit!  Everything is typically pretty fresh and tasty but I don't know if the prices are justified.    Maybe it's just me, but I can't fathom valet parking and waiting an hour for mexican food.  I like my mexican food straight up, authentic and dirty and so the \"hype\" around this place is just a little corny to me.    The parking lot is too small for the volume of guests but they DO take reservations so that is a good thing.    All in all it is a fun, good place to eat but make sure you have realistic expectations before going!  And, remember--the guacamole alone is worth the visit!",

We all ordered drinks from the bar and they were watered down as if they were sitting there. Got 1 order of chips and salsa and never got a chance to get a refill. One of the girls was missing her dish. Couldn't even get the server to tell him. Finally told him and he said they will make it soon. After 15 mins she still didn't get it. They finally came to give her her food and she told them she didn't want it anymore because of the wait. That is ridiculous for her to not have her plate of food and to wait that long. One girl ordered guacomole appetizer and didn't even get a chance to ask for chips. Terrible. Food isn't even good.",

It was full of black beans and little to no chicken at all!! Not to mention, the guacamole sides that came with the chimichanga was so small (maybe a pinch of lettuce and a teaspoon of the tomatoes). Compared to the CANTINA 1511 at the Park Road Shopping Center, which is great btw, this restaurant drops far low beyond the \"restaurant acceptable\" range. If I had to say, McDonald's or a Chinese Buffet would probably be better than what I experienced/ate at the Cantina 1511 at StoneCrest. Never going back here again. Waste of my money. I could have gone to the Nothing But Noodles or ChickFilA across the street and actually enjoyed my food. We took a to go box home only to have it thrown away.",

    "text": "To be fair, I wrote an e-mail to the General Manager first, and he didn't respond after over a week so here's my update.  Went for lunch a week and a half ago, it was for my daughters birthday lunch and she loves Cantina 1511 as does my whole family.    The restaurant had a large number of flies, so much so that they impeded my families enjoyment of their lunch.  The flies were pretty bad during the chips and salsa stage but got worse when the meal arrived.  They asked to be moved and they were accommodated.  Once they moved a Manager (female) came over and offered a lame explanation about it being summer and flies are to be expected.      They finally left after paying for their meal which couldn't be eaten because they were pretty disgusted because of the fly issue.  It was a slow lunch day and not many people were in the restaurant.  They left after splitting the bill with the other party, the bill was around $60.00 ($28.22 which was half the bill).     Normally we like the restaurant and my wife who isn't a complainer her opinion is that she doesn't want to go back, which, I'm sure isn't what they want to hear  My kids didn't want to eat the food they boxed up and brought home because of the memories of the flies.  My wife has worked in restaurants for many years and I am in the commercial food industry, and we know there are sprays out there that can eliminate flies.  The managers explanation simply doesn't cut it and it sounds like she needs some retraining on how to respond to customer issues.",

I ordered a meal that did not list raw tomato as an ingredient because I am allergic to it. When my meal came there was raw tomato all over it. I said something to the waitress who snarked at me that she would send the manager over.  The manager never appeared nor did any drink refills. We had to flag the waitress down to get the check as she was busy standing near the door starring out into space. They really need to check on their staff. This girl was rude and inept at her job",

    "text": "This is my 2nd bad review of this restaurant, the 1st i did via open table back in august 2014 but chose this way since it is more visible and again it is my 2nd bad review and perhaps it will be noticed more by the restaurant. My husband and I decided to do an impromptu supper/movie date night. The restaurant next door had a 1.5 hour wait, cantina had none so we chose to go there. We were sat immediately and noticed that the seating had changed as did the look of the menu. We waited, and waited at our table and were not acknowledged at all by anyone.  My husband and I are very patient, we both worked in the industry and understand things can get busy but it is expected that someone should have acknowledged us, even if it was to say \"ill be right with  you\". I looked at my cell phone  after being there a bit and said to my husband \"if no one comes in 3 minutes were are leaving\", I waited 4 and we got u p and left. We stopped by the hostess stand to let them know why we were leaving and decide to walk to one of the other restaurants in the plaza. The manager did chase us down and apologized (which was definitely appreciated and warranted) but we had a movie to catch and were not happy, it was too late. This is the 1st time I have ever walked out of a restaurant, it was the 2nd time we had a huge issue with service. I do not think we will be back, we waited a long time between our last disappointment and this time and were let down again. Again,we understand things happen but I can tell you that one of the 1st tings I learned in every restaurant I ever worked in is, patrons should be greeted in some capacity as quickly as possible (within 3 minutes).  Perhaps this is one reason they had no wait while their competitor had 1.5 hours.",

    "text": "I would've given this place 5 stars because the food was probably the best Mexican food I'd ever eaten but the service wasn't up to par.  Granted that we went during the Queen's Feast, which we totally forgot that it was going on.  I've worked in many restaurants and have also worked in a nice restaurant that participated in Charlotte's Queen's Feast and I know how busy you are but I also know that you shouldn't make your guest feel rushed ESPECIALLY since you didn't spiel the Queen's Feast specials to them and they ordered off the regular menu.  My boyfriend, daughter, and my baby went and waited for 1.5 hours (we were told before hand that the wait would be 45 min!)to be seated.  The hostesses were nice and we didn't mind waiting but with two kids that was quite a long time considering we were going to eat at the Firebirds next door but decided on a different restaurant because they told us the wait would be less. Any way, once seated our server was a male and right off the bat I can tell he was rushing us, my boyfriend asked if there were any specials and he told us they didn't for that day.  Never once did he informed us that it was Queen's Feast and the restaurant was featuring a menu for the event.  He got us our appetizers and our entree's (very quickly)  and everything was delicious.  I got the Frontier Fajita with Chicken and Steak, it was probably the best Fajita dish I've ever eaten and it came with all the condiments I would have wanted to add to my Fajita.  The seasoning was perfect and the portions was excessive.  My boyfriend got the Barbacoa dish and he is a big fan of Barbacoa, he said that was the most delish dish of Barbacoa he's had.  My daughter had the kids dish, Chicken Quesadilla and fries, she really enjoyed her dinner. We didn't finish most of our foods and asked for to go boxes. The server came by a few times to see how  things were going, he offered to box up our food for us.  I knew he was probably busy and weeded and was unsure if I wanted him to box our food up but my boyfriend said \"yes\".  I was still eating so he boxed up my boyfriend's dish, my daughter's, and our appetizers. My baby needed his little hands washed so I left with my daughter to go to the bathroom, When I came back, my food was gone, I assumed our server boxed it up for me while I was gone. We ordered the Quatro Leches cake and it was divine. It was perfectly made, very buttery and moist with I'm guessing is a marshmellow type topping that's slightly browned on top. My boyfriend went ahead and paid for our dinner and I have to say, it certainly didn't hurt our wallet!  Great food for a great price. My boyfriend asked if ALL the food was in the bag and the server said yes so we didn't question it. But before my boyfriend can even eat a bite of our dessert, our server came back and asked if he can box up the dessert, my boyfriend's response was \"umm no, I'm still eating\".  I know you are busy but you as a server still need to ensure your guest have a good dining experience. I was ready to go at that point ,  We left Cantina and went home. When we got home and checked our food, our server did not box up my fajita. The food was also just thrown in the box. I was very disappointed as I really didn't get to eat too much with having to take care of my 8 mth old. I was really looking forward to finishing my dinner at home! There was a lot left too....so I was a sad bunny with no fajita. I had to make me some noodles instead!  So over all, I like the restaurant and love the food, but...the service could've been better,  And I know its restaurant week but your service should never be less. We left a good tip too...we always do.  We will be going back and hopefully the service will be better. :)",

The fish tacos aren't amazing, but are decent.  The chicken is good as is the pork.  Other people at my table had the fajitas and burritos and everyone left happy.  We got the table-side guacamole too and that was pretty good.  The margaritas are good quality even with the house tequila.  So overall its somewhere around a 3 or 4.  I gave it a 4 just because I feel its better than average. I don't think you'll be overwhelmed, but not disappointed either.  Its fine for kids and groups.  May be a wait on weekends as lots of people go here pre-movie theater.",

    "text": "After discussing lunch plans and deciding that we were  long overdue for some Mexican food my girlfriend and I decided to give Cantina 1511 a try.  For starters, the hostess sat us in a relatively unoccupied section and then sat subsequent patrons right next to us.  Although we were seated before the party next to us they got waited on first.  A few minutes later, Tim, our waiter materializes to taken our order.  Tim did take the time to help us navigate the menu and pointed out the main categories which was helpful.  After careful consideration, I ordered the two tacos - a carnes asada and whatever the duck one is called.  My girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas Verde.  Interestingly enough,  the fresh-made-to-order food came out not even 10 minutes after we ordered.  We barely had time to enjoy the greasy and over-salted chips that tasted of old cooking oil and salsa that tasted slightly worse than Old El Paso.  My girlfriend's entree arrives on a skillet with a pile of something under a pool of runny cheese and a another plate with two pitiful looking soft tacos (my entree).  We had both ordered black beans which were void of any real flavor and a complete disappointment (don't get me started on the Charro beans).  A minute or two into digging into her meal, my girlfriend realizes that there's chicken in her enchiladas.  We soon figured out she had been given the wrong entree.  Despite the mistake, the entree tasted like something you might get at a Senior's Center on Mexican food night. Thankfully she is no longer vegetarian.  We quickly flagged down the waiter and explained the mistake.  He said he would check with the kitchen but then showed up a few minutes later with our check.  Needless to say, we'll not be giving this place a second chance.",

    "text": "This is one of my friends' favorite restaurant because she cannot eat flower or sugar in her special diet and they offer her a pretty good selection. Thus, we have been here a couple of times before. Today was a perfect day for us to eat outside in their patio but I was alittle disappointed in the service becaue the server seemed a little out of it and it took him some time to take our order. The inside of restaurant is a little dark and noisy for me at times but the setting is, after all, more bar and grill. We always order the  Top Shelf Guacamole where they make it fresh in front of you. Normally it is very good but today it was a little salty. You really don't need to order this as an appetizer because their complementary chips and salsa are great and addicting by itself. I had the Tacos Marco Polo which is shrimp, jalapeno bacon and caramelized rajas with pico de gallo, and melted cheese served with tomato saffron rice and black beans (I did not have the cheese nor the beans). The taste was wonderful as evidenced by me finishing both tacos and half of the rice. It was a little pricey for two tacos though ($11.00). My friend ordered the Cantina Nachos for $8, which she said was a good deal for a huge portion of chips with chicken, onions, peppers, black beans served with pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole. . . it did not look appetizing to me but she said she liked (although she did not finish much of it). I am sure we will be back but it's not on the top of my favorite food list.",

This time i had a Creative Loafing deal and decided to try the Stonecrest location. I was definitely underwhelmed. We had a reservation for 7:00. When we arrived we were promptly seated. I immediately felt like i was at Chuck E Cheese or Red Robin. Kids Galore!! So much for date night. Our tables were so close together it was a little uncomfortable.   We ordered the Fajitas for two with Steak and Beef. The little tapas they brought out were pretty tasty. The fajitas were a little overpriced in my opinion. We maybe had 10 pieces of chicken on a platter of zucchini, onions and mushrooms. $30 for some veggies is a little crazy.   I would maybe go back but not likely.",

I brought out of town family. 3 of us ordered the Barbacoa - which was highly recommended by our server. I thought the meat was very salty. I was surprised when my other 2 family members who love salt said the same thing.  Then I knew it wasn't my imagination.  We made mention to our server and she apologized.   My margarita was heavy on the sour mix and not terribly authentic.  For the price, there are many other lower priced options in the area.",

I walked over to a Wendy's and ate a hamburger so i didn't expire during the wait.  Service was good, food was excellent and fresh Mexican fare. The margarita flight special at 15.00 dollars equates to a 21oz margarita. Not a great deal and a bit showy for my taste. Variety is the spice, but I can do one margarita at a time if it costs half as much.",

As for the food I ordered a chimichunga it was okay but I wouldn't order it again.  It was as if they are trying too hard to make it different, if that's the case the succeeded.  However, I think they should have focused on making it better.",

Both dishes were good and a lot, I ate maybe 1/2 of mine and so did the person I was with. The prices are good for the amount of food you get. It's the drinks that are pricey! We had ordered 2 of the margarita flight specials which we only liked 1 of the 3. I agree with Brett R.'s review, for $15 you're better off getting a full drink.",

Apparently they changed ownership and I visited the restaurant with my husband again a couple of weeks ago. It was a waste of our time and calories. The only good thing was the service. The chips tasted old and their red salsa tasted like everyone else's, straight out of the bottle. I read that their green salsa was incredible, so I ordered it, and it was a shame! It tasted straight out of the bottle too. I am Mexican, I would know! I ordered a burrito and it was okay, nothing out of the ordinary as it used to be. Definitely not worth my trip to this place, when I can most likely find fresher food with more taste at some spot down central avenue. I wasn't looking for authentic, I know that is hard to find, but I was looking for quality food that is unique in taste and savory. Not coming back again!",

We waited an hour for our food (at lunch), had no chip refills (we ordered guacamole and queso) and no drink refills. We paid for our food before it even came out and when I brought all of this to the attention of the manager he said he 'would give a few of the girls free guacamole coupons'. Needless to say, I was less than impressed and would rather go to one of the twenty other restaurants in the area for lunch in the future.   Oh and there was no apology for the terrible service and timing.",

I'd read mixed reviews about this place was I'll admit I was a bit skeptical trying this place but I was actually very pleased with my visit.   We arrived a little before 6pm and the place wasn't too packed, we were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt and attentive. The chips and salsa arrived first. The chips were warm...always a good sign! And the salsa was good too! It wasn't too chunky or full of cilantro it was delicious! We practically inhaled the first basket!    I decided to try the S'Western Nachos with chicken. The nachos come topped with your choice of chicken or beef and black beans, queso, caramelized onions, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. I ordered the half size portion but it was MORE than enough for a good meal. They added a lot of chicken, almost every bite I had included some chicken. I loved them! I would absolutely order them again....but next time with a margarita because I'll have more time!   I'm going to have to go back and try something else off the menu but so far they win my approval.",

    "text": "Our group was accosted by the manager who continued to escalate the situation to the point of making everyone in the room feel very uncomfortable.  We had a very large group of 26 and rented out the private room for a birthday party.  After dinner everyone asked for their tabs and absolute confusion among the wait staff ensued for over 20 minutes.  They were asking everyone what they had and it was crystal clear that something had gone wrong with their ticketing system or ability to operate it correctly.  Everyone grew impatient and as tabs were brought out in waves (in some cases 1 by 1) people were asked if it looked correct to them or if they saw any mistakes.  Those that felt their bill was correct then settled up and exited as it was late and many in the group had baby sitters at home waiting on them.  As one of the last remaining couples, my wife and I were finally handed our bill.  We gave our card and while we were waiting for our card to be processed the manager made his first appearance of the night.  He approached the group and let everyone know that there was $40 in random food and drinks that hadn't been claimed and gave an ultimatum that someone pay it or it would be added to the minimum requirement ($800 required to reserve the private room) which everyone knew would fall on the husband of the birthday girl as he had made the reservation.  Immediately and without argument the birthday girl's husband stepped right up and said \"no problem, I got it\" as he took the marginal check and signed it.  At this point several couples felt offended by the way in which the manager approached the group, it was as if he was accusing us of stealing.  We began to let the manager know that in fact everyone had happily worked with the staff through what we deemed to be a blunder on their part and tried to make the best of a bad situation.  He took great offense to this and said that in fact it was our fault for everyone not remembering what they had. Our group had been waiting for close to 30 minutes to cash out at this point and no one was in the mood to be accosted and talked down to.  The back and forth escalated with the manager becoming more and more standoffish until finally when you could cut the tension in the room with a knife, his wait staff stepped in to intervene by physically stepping between him and our group (who were all still seated) and pointing out that we had already paid his $40 demand.  I have never in my life witnessed a company representative behave in this way and many in the group, especially the women, felt threatened and intimidated.  It is also worth noting that the sum of the bills among 4 of the last remaining couples totaled over $500 so it is hard for me to believe that the sum of the other 9 couples bills totaled less than $300 to meet the minimum.",

But get at least one dish that includes their shrimp. Best I have ever had anywhere, including NOLA!  Do yourself a favor and get a Papa Grande Margarita.  This was recommended to us by our very fun waiter, Max. We had a delightful meal and drinks and will be back. You should give them a try.",

Its awful, the food is OVER SALTED, its plain salty. The chips salty, the queso has to many sweet onions that overtake it, same with the stake quesadia,  the burrito and tacos are non edible. I ordered the steak burrito and did not eat it. picked the meat out, packet with undercooked rice and stale cold tortilla.. My wife ordered the enchiladas swissa verde and the chicken was boiled and dried out. It had a disgusting taste to it. I tried to take a bite but the smell made me gag.The beans are undercooked and so is the rice I'm sure to the casual chain eating diner they may be o.k. with this place but if your a foodie. stay clear.

    "text": "Awful service. My wife and I used to come here for lunch once or twice a month a few years ago and the service was better. Now we have been back twice recently and both times (different servers) were frustrating to say the least. The first time was last week- my mother in law's wine took about 20 minutes to get to us despite the waitress saying there were no customers at the bar. The queso dip we ordered also took about 20-25 minutes to get to our table. Only one person received water at our table. Our entrees took an abnormally long time to get to us. I understand it's not necessarily the waitress' fault but she made excuses for everything and long drawn out ones. Basically everything took forever and we were left at our table without water or refills on salsa, beer and wine for extremely long periods of time. We all left complaining how disorganized and frustrating the experience was. The waitress did convince the manager to take off our queso from the bill which we appreciated but it would have made us feel a lot better about the situation had the manager come to speak to us about it as well.   Then today my wife and I decided to give it another try as we used to like the chopped salad as a lunch option and we thought maybe they had just been having an off day before. My wife ordered an Unsweet tea, the young waiter brought her a sweet tea. It took him a while to come back to the table. We both ordered the soup and salad combo. They got hers right this time but I only got a salad, no soup. We were both clear on what we wanted but it just didn't seem like the waiter was \"all there\". Like he was tired and unfocused and didn't want to be there. He also forgot our refill of salsa. When we were done with our meal it took forever for anyone to come check on us. We were sitting there with our food pushed away ready to get the check. The manager even peaked at us and saw us sitting there but still no one came. Finally we got the check and couldn't wait to get out of there because it took so long.  The food is decent here but it really does feel like there is an issue with the management that trickles down to the lack of urgency and quality of service with the waiters. The staff acts like they don't really care that much even when it's not busy. The overall sense of service in this restaurant is not good. There needs to be more management and accountability with the staff.",

    "text": "Don't come here with a party larger than 5. We were here for a dinner, with a party of 15. We arrived here at 7pm were sat, and our waiter took care of our drinks. Unfortunately, I believe it was also our waiters first table of a vast size. After sitting for about an hour, our meal orders were taken, and they came out in a greater than timely manner. Then we ate.....and played the waiting game. Our poor waiter was left to himself to divy up the checks (spilt between 5, all seated in order and not changing). He came back with our checks, which were not split correctly, besides one couples. Then, that couple paid (over $100), and the manger came and said it was confusing and wanted to split the rest of the check between everyone, at $25 each. This did not appease anyone, especially the people whose meals were less than $10. Finally, after about 45 minutes of trying to figure this out, the manager FINALLY came out and made us retell our orders one by one. This was a whole ordeal at a table full of previous servers that could have been easily avoided.   Additionally, the food, it was just sub-par (will give props to the table side guacamole).   Overall, there are plenty of different restaurants in this complex or other Mexican restaurants in the area to satisfy your craving.",

    "text": "In the last year in a half, I've noticed a marked decrease in quality at both the Dilworth and Stonecrest restaurants.  At Stonecrest, our cold sides for fajitas were put under a heat lamp and the lettuce was all burnt.  Who does that???  The other thing I noticed, at both locations, they prepped the plates way in advance of the main dish and stuck it under a heat lamp until the main dish was ready.  The top of my beans were singed.  This is on more than one occasion, too.  The heat lamp appears to be akin to a microwave in a bad restaurant here.  In Europe, they bring each dish out when it's ready so no heat lamp is necessary.  I wish we'd be more like that in the US rather than trying to hold up dishes to serve altogether.  It rarely works.  Someone's dish is going to be subpar doing it that way.  The last time we ate there, so many things were wrong, we complained to the mgr.  We are generally not complainers.  I will say the management made it right.  They comp'd the entire meal.  However, we've struggled to have the desire to go back - we even have a 50% off coupon to use!!!  At Dilworth, the wattage in the pendant lighting was so bright we were squinting the entire time (not joking.)  We even sent an \"anonymous text message to the manager\" about it.  It was horrible.  Also, the music was so loud, we were practically screaming at each other.  Restaurants, please, if you have to scream to hear yourselves talk to each other, the music is TOO LOUD!  I'm not an old fuddyduddy.  I enjoy some good ambient music, too, but it's not a freaking disco!  It's too bad the quality of the food and atmosphere has decreased.  It used to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Now the desire to return escapes me.",

We were there to celebrate a birthday, two people ordered the crab and avocado quesadillas without bacon. One order came out perfect, the second did not have one piece of crabmeat in the quesadilla. Politely tell the server whose response is, 'I'm so sorry, the kitchen is killing me tonight. I'll be back with a new one.' A new meal is delivered BUT it now has bacon in it... the server again apologizes, says we will not be charged for this meal. We ask for it to be wrapped up to go as everyone else was finished with their meal by now. The manager comes out not to apologize or deliver the new order but to show us 3 opened quesadillas to argue about the existence of bacon! After many words about her lack of customer service or managerial skills, not only were we not offered dessert to celebrate the reason we were even there, we were promptly delivered our checks. NEVER GOING BACK! The manager on duty was named Stephanie although I can't imagine her holding that position long... there are so many options in the area for great Mexican food, avoid this restaurant at all costs. It was the Stonecrest location. On a more pleasant note, we then went next door to Firebirds, had an amazing server, great drinks and dessert. After discussing with her what happened next door at Cantina, she brought our birthday girl another dessert on the house to take home with her. THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE, THATS HOW YOU CREATE A RAVING FAN! Not only will I tell everyone I know about the horror of Cantina, I'll also be singing the praises of Firebirds and Victoria. Go see her, she works Saturday evenings - amazing customer service!",

Seriously, it is huge  & I cannot eat it all.   I also enjoy their enchiladas here...although, they recently changed the menu and I can no longer get my fav enchilada so that was a bit of a bummer.

Our waiter was a pain and did not want to tell my mom the price of the brisket that is no longer listed on the menu. After asking about 5 times and him constantly expressing his dissatisfaction with the restaurant taking it off the menu, he finally gave us an answer. My mom loved the brisket...she always does.   I ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and it was yummy. You can't really mess up table side guacamole since you can tell the waiter/waitress what to add. For my entree, I had the Crab and Avocado Quesadilla. Nothing special and it came with no sides. Although it isn't listed on the menu, the quesadillas come in two sizes (small and large). I think I got the small, but who knows.   Cantina 1511 used to be on my list of places to go every time I return to Charlotte but I think this will be my last time.",

I've tried different ones every time and never been disappointed. Had a blood orange margarita last time and it was very good. The only weird thing I will say is their takeout option. You order then show up and the hostess directs you to this tiny computer next to the bar and right in front of the kitchen. It's extremely tight and you are in the servers way the entire time. Probably would make more sense for the hostess to get it? That's my only recommendation. We will likely eat here many more times due to it being walking distance from our house.",

We've been here before where we've waited 30 minutes for our food only to be told the waiter forgot to put it into the system so he just submitted it and it'll only be a few more minutes... we've sat with empty water glasses for what feels like an eternity... had rude waiters that don't know their own menu or specials... the list goes on... it's honestly like the servers here have never eaten in a restaurant themselves and don't understand the level of service they should provide. Because at the end of the day, it's just not that hard... good service makes up for pretty much everything else that could go wrong...it's just so essential and so missing from these restaurants.

They use orange juice, and that's all you could taste.  I ordered fajitas.  The platter was huge, but they only gave you three tortillas. Fajita should be simple--protein, onions and peppers.  The condiment plate had pickled carrots and onions that overtook the rest of the condiments.  They could simplify the dish, and it would be better.  My companions dish was inedible.  The manager was fantastic and offers a free desert.  We got the tres leche,  one of my favorites.  It would have been good, but they added marshmallows or fluff all over the top.

We were both very satisfied, al though I would have ordered something if I were her. We both have bit of a sweet tooth, so to end it all off nicely, we ordered the 'Cuatro leches'. Holy *%#&, we both LOVED the desert!  So, if you want good tex-mex in a casual, yet excellent service ambiance, then you have to go here.",

I've eaten here a few times and the first couple were pretty delicious (LOVING that queso fundido) but the last time was so salty, I couldn't even eat. I sucked down tea like I'd never had a drink in my life just trying to put some moisture back into my tongue. With the over-salting and the high prices, I'd much rather go to another Mexican restaurant where it feels more authentic and rich, and where the food seems more genuine and tastes tons better.  Just wish I could take that queso fundido with me...  I will also say that if you happen to wander in late (a big no-no for me, but sometimes things happen) they won't turn you away and they serve you with the same courteous and friendly behavior as if it were the middle of the day.

    "text": "To begin with, I don't understand Cantina 1511's apparent fetish for playing Mexican music at ear-bleeding sound levels. My wife and I were in one mid-week evening after the crowd had departed and were one of only a handful of tables occupied in the entire place. We literally could not hold a conversation sitting 90 degrees from one another at a square table. When we placed our order, we also asked that the music be turned down to a moderate level, and I swear our server was overjoyed to have an excuse to turn it down.  That said, the food was OK, not great. As transplanted Californians, perhaps our standard for \"great\" is a little higher than someone else's, but the food was serviceable. I just don't think it justified the prices charged. The brutal truth about Mexican food is that, for the staples (enchiladas, burritos, etc), the costs are minimal, the degree of difficulty in preparation is  minuscule, the time required to plate up an order shouldn't take 20-30 minutes, and it shouldn't cost $8 to $10.  That night, the service was rather prompt but other visits we have seen very slow service. And at all times, the damn music was just obnoxious.  I'd return, but only to sit outside, and not anytime soon. To those of you who love Cantina 1511, mazel tov. I'm happy for you. I know there is a better job being done in Charlotte, though.",

I hadn't been to a Cantina 1511 since it's East Blvd days so when I was in South Charlotte to meet my husband and mother-in-law for lunch, I was all in when she suggested we meet at the Rea Road location.  We met at 11:30 and were one of about 3-4 tables.  My husband and MIL had ordered queso dip before I had arrived.  They do their own interperation of queso dip, its not the delicious goodness you find at all other Mex restaurants and it was just ok.  Service was decent, a polite young girl took our order after I arrived but that quickly went downhill after more people started coming in, though it was far from busy.  Towards the end of our meal, I ended up going to the waitress station and grabbing a water pitcher as both my husband and I were completely out of water and hadn't been checked on in quite some time.  My MIL had the cobb salad and didn't have any complaints.  My husband had the Enchiladas Tejanos.  He thought it was oily and overall not enjoyable (the man rarely complains about anything.)  I had the Enchiladas De Pollo.  It completely lacked ANY kind of flavor and was drowned in the queso dip.  Literally tasted like a plain rolled up tortilla covered in cheese and not in a good way.  Our waitress didn't even ask if everything was ok when I clearly hadn't eaten half of what was on my plate and obviously didn't ask for it to be boxed up.  Wanted to like this place as a location opened a short while ago at Park Road Shopping Center, just .25 miles from my house.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and wouldn't go back.",

We ordered two house margaritas which were awesome! We were paged after about 15 minutes and seated. Once we were seated we received chips and salsa and asked if we needed a drink refill, which we did. After reviewing the menu, we chose the pork tacos and chicken fajitas. While we waited we enjoyed the fresh chips and salsa, which had a kick, which I loved. The smell in the restaurant was great so we were anxious for our food to arrive. The pork tacos were amazing! The pork was moist, almost melt in your mouth and had chopped pineapples which added a great flavor. And, the fajitas, best I have had in a long time! Piping hot, great grilled veggies, and accompanied with warm tortillas and a great assortment of sour cream, cheese, guacamole, and a few other items. What a great experience and I look forward to getting back to this location!",

I am not sure if it was lack of training or simply her lackadaisical demeanor.  There were crushed chips under at least 40% of the tables with no effort to clean between diners.  We were given some \"gluten free\" chips and told they were out of regular chips.  WOW!!  Later in the meal these BAGGED chips were swapped out with not fresh fried but room temperature house made chips.  The server took my empty glass to refill my tea.  While she was away with my glass a server delivered our food, we at that point asked for silverware.  WOW!!  Jessica passed our table five times without returning my tea.  Twelve minutes later after she had passed the fifth time she returned with another glass of tea.  Cheese dip was good, and dinner was very good.  Though not what I ordered with the server.  Food is well worth the trip, but doubt I will be returning due to the extremely poor service.",

A really tall gentleman came by because I think the server might have picked up on my frustration. He brought out the salsa!!

It didn't take long to get a seat, but it took forever to be acknowledged by a server.  We sat out in the patio, which is probably the best part of the restaurant that night.  It shares the patio with Firebird next door, and they had an acoustic guitar guy playing.  It's great ambience.    Since we filled ourselves up with movie popcorns and soda, we didn't per se have dinner.  We shared the tortilla soup and the shrimp & crab ceviche.  The ceviche was ok; the soup wasn't much to write home about, it was more like a tomato veggies soup than tortilla soup in my opinion.  For beverages, I had a white sangria which was more sweet than strong.  His dragon something was very much like a mojito and was better than my drink.  All completed with a set of dirty silverware.    In all, Cantina serves the purpose of a decent place to eat that has some kind of an atmosphere.  Definitely not the best of anything, but it's an ok option.",

He left and came back minutes later with chips and salsa (delish!!) and our beer followed closely behind. He took our order at the same time.  We ordered the tableside guac (which was delicious) and our mains. our waiter showed up again minutes later, and made the guac for us. He left and we dug right in! he came by to see if it was to our liking and we said it definitely was.  our meals arrived a few minutes later.  He was the type of waiter who knows when to approach the table, and when not to. He was there before our drinks were empty, and came by to ask how our meals were. When I asked if I could box the rest of my meal (the chimichanga is massive) he said he would do that, and also throw in the chips and salsa and the guac.  Our meal (3 beer, table side guac, chimichanga, and 3 steak tacos) came to 57.38 with tax. This will definitely be our goto Mexican! Especially if we can have Hunter as our waiter. I really can't say enough good things about him! He was absolutely incredible!",

All you have to do is close to right and it is delicious.  They easily took care of that.  I have the Johnny Carnitas Tacos and they were amazing.  The service is what blew me away.  They really know how to take care of the customer.  We sat in the bar area and were immediately greeted and our drinks were taken care of.  They told us all about the margarita options and the servers knew all everything about the dinner choices.  It was truly a wonderful experience that I look forward to experiencing again.  Tip top service, beautiful surroundings, and excellent food.  You wont be disappointed.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

Anyhow, the waitress and hostess were both friendly and accommodating.  Both of us starving so I immediately ordered the guacamole that's prepared table side.  Nice little touch, always consistent in flavor and enough for 4 to share. A good value for $8. My entree of redfish(really, redfish is back?) was cooked perfectly, tender and still juicy.  It was smothered with roasted artichokes in a garlic butter sauce. I love garlic but somebody overdosed the sauce making it bitter and slightly displeasing.  My wife's brisket enchiladas were tender, slightly sauced, and plenty of food. We had ordered house margaritas with Patron.  Pretty good in tanginess but for a $12 drink I would not expect to have sour mix or OJ.  It takes away from the tequila. We will return, food is usually good and plentiful, but I have to question the value. Totally not related but what is up with kids dining with headphones on and watching IPads?  Can't parent talk to their children during a social dining experience? How are these kids going to learn to act in public? Really; don't get me started.  Maybe we should share the no smoking in public and tack on no electronics at the dinner table!",

    "text": "I have never been a fan of Cantina and I finally discovered why I love their menu but don't like their food.    Do I sound a bit odd?  Let me explain.  Cantina claims that they serve authentic Mexican food and they do not.  They offer authentic categories of Mexican food, but having lived and traveled extensively in Mexico this is not it.  Someone mentioned \"pretentious\" and that is part of my issue. A lot of flash, garnishment and slick service, but the product is not authentic at all.  Their menu is fantastic.  Such variety of common Mexican foods.  Their taco menu is the best and that is where I go when I end up here.  The tacos are in two categories: their recommended versions, different takes on toppings.  And the mix and match option whereby you can order which ones you like at at discounted price.  BUT...even some of the tacos are \"jazzed-up\" into unusual concoctions.  Some are odd to me.  And so are the other categories, like enchiladas, quesadillas, burritos.  I keep trying other things in the hope that it will be SOMETHING I like, but fail every time.    My discovery is that, the meal items, they all are \"sweet\".  Caramelized onions dominate many of the dishes and even those are sweet like they were cooked with balsamic vinegar. The pickled onions they liberally put into dishes really clashes with the food itself.  On the other hand, most of the food is bland, take the salsa and beans.  Just not to my taste, but the rating is because my odd taste preferences clash with those of my son's family, which includes three grandchildren and many others that just love 1511.  And they do have a following, but I am not one of the followers.  There are many far more authentic Mexican places that are not fancy or pretentious.  If you are looking really good Mexican, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Great! If you're white and have never left home.  Seriously disappointed. Menu touts authentic Mexican food but the servers walked out of the Abercrombie and Fitch catalog and the only Brown faces are relegated to bus boys. If you're selling me Mexican food, hire Mexicans to cook it, sell it and serve it and let the white boys do the dishes. Speaking of diversity, do any African Americans work here? No, I don't want to see pics of you and your black friend.  Let's start with the salsa. Tastes like it uses canned tomato sauce. I asked for and added fresh cilantro, lime and salt and it was Not quite nearly edible.   I ordered 2 tacos: duck carnitas and Baja fish. They were both covered in some terrible pink picked onions. The duck taco had 2 extra ingredients...half an avocado and an inch long piece of bone that I had to fish out of my throat.   There are a million ways to make this taco better but step 1 would be stop trying to be so pretentious. Mexican food is humble elegance. The fish taco was unimpressive, after I excavated it from it's pickled onion tomb the fish was dry. This was served with a slaw that tasted fresh and was the only actual GOOD thing on the plate. It was also served with black beans (no seasoning, no taste) and some white rice with ugly canned peas and corn it it. Like they bought the cheapest frozen veggies they could find and threw it in.  The very white manager came by to see how I enjoyed my meal. I asked him what region of Mexico their food was from....he couldn't tell me.....he did mention all the cooks are Mexican when I told him this is white people food dressed up like Mexican food for people who have never traveled and don't know any better. He offered to comp my meal, I declined. He insisted on telling me how they roast the tomatoes for their salsa and all of the food was created by Mexican chefs.   Don't waste your money. Not authentic, flavor profiles lack cohesion and originality, if they have real Mexicans working they hide them in the lowest paying jobs while profiting off their culture.",

You simply can't go wrong with the Prima Guac @ Cantina!       I've had excellent service while sitting at the bar here for lunch.  I've had very lackluster service as well.  Either way, the staff at this establishment is always welcoming ,and friendly.  There's also plenty of parking in the busy Stonecrest Shopping Center.  If you live and breath in Charlotte, North Carolina, then I'm sure you've at least heard of Cantina before - if you haven't been down here to the Stonecrest location, give it a try, its got the same savory Tex-Mex flavor as the original location @ 1511 East Blvd!",

I was a little off put by the fact that this night they had run out of steak and scallops but I suppose these things happen from time to time.

She huffed  and walked us to our table. I have run restaurants and would certainly want to know if guest were being treated like this by the restaurant initial contact. I asked for a manager...one showed up 20 minutes later...sorta so late we just chalked up the visit to a joke. Food was fair Music was Great. We've been to Cantina many times...this was most likely our Last Visit. Go at your own risk...new ownership has really let thing slip. PM",

There was so much queso on top of my enchiladas that it made it extremely hard to eat. I might as well have just ordered queso as my main entree. The side of rice that was given to me looked and tasted like fried rice from a local Chinese restaurant.   My service was outstanding and that is probably the only thing that was great about my dining experience. I definitely will not be returning. If I want some Mexican food, I will head to Central Ave. for some authentic food.",

Seconds after we had been seated we were brought chips and salsa and drink orders were being taken.  The meal itself was also brought out very quickly.  I ordered their chicken fajitas and we ordered a side of con queso cheese.  The cheese was very good, though it was served a bit cold, and the fajitas were excellent.  The fajitas were served with lettuce, guacamole, tomatoes, cheese and picked onions --which were interesting but very good!  The fajitas were served on a traditional sizzling cast-iron pan and were absolutely wonderful.  That consisted of onions, peppers, chicken --the standard fajita plate.  My wife ordered a chicken burrito and was quite surprised when it was put on the table --it would have been difficult to fit this thing through the Channel Tunnel in Europe!  The burrito was gigantic --and very tasty, too!  Overall this was a great experience and we really enjoyed the food.  The service was second to none --though the restaurant was pretty slow.  I felt the food was a bit pricy; however, the service and great taste offset that and therefore I felt the price could be justified.  I cannot wait to go back!",

Our last visit was this week and I think it will  be our last. We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the Enchilada Verde. We were disapointed with both. The shrimps on he fajitas were smaller than ususal and the vegetables were thinner than any other time. The plate was full of caramalized onions.  The Enchilada Verde was not even close to the description on the menu. According to the menu, the plate is prepared with spinash and mushrooms. Yet , the plate we got was nothing but a combination of melted cheeses.   The service was ok but nothing special.",

    "text": "Allow me to explain my ratings: 4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the revamped menu (read: PRICE HIKE).  Cantina tends to be my go-to place for Mexican. More because my daughter seems to love it here, and it's hard to please the culinary habits of a picky 5-year-old. We never go wrong here. We love the service - the waitstaff always seem to be personable, and I always appreciate management coming around just to say hi - and the food, a little more upscale take on more traditional Mexican fare (as opposed to, say, Tex-Mex, which is traditional, yes, but more akin towards Yanqui tastes, so you know) that always hits the spot.  So when I saw the menu had changed, I cringed. Menu changes often mean bad things, like some of your favorite plates have been unceremoniously removed from the menu. Alas, some of my favorite taco plates are no longer an option. Still, there's plenty more to chose from, and I did enjoy the shrimp and scallop tacos.  However...lunch the other day was $55. SERIOUSLY? Between my 3-taco plate, my wife's chicken quesadillas, my daughter's quesadilla's, a bowl of plantains, and a pint of beer, that all came out to $55, not including tip?   Wow. I can afford to drop $55 for lunch, but I object on principle. There better have been about 3 or 4 more pints of Negra Modelo included in that bill.  Oh well. You'll likely see me back at Cantina, except this time I'll be a bit more judicious about what I order, just to satisfy my frugality.",

But get the guacamole. The spinach enchiladas were also good, if very cheesy. The black beans were a little salty.  The corn fritters were talked up by our server, but they didn't really deliver, and I'm unsure I would serve them as a desert. The peach dessert was much better, probably because we are in Cackalack while they are in season!  The service was outgoing and friendly, helpful and quick to attention. Good service.  This is Mexican that is supposedly fancified, but it seems mostly you're just paying more for stuff that seems to be modestly better than the cheap, gut-busting stuff.

We came here on July 4th as we were going to the movies in the same center.  First we had to wait 10 minutes to be sat.  Now this would not be a problem had it not been for the fact there where only 5 tables in there.  There were almost as many servers as customers so you kinda see my point here.  The person who said he was our server was to busy so someone else came to get our drink order. Again waited 10 minutes for them,. Next we placed our order and waited 20 minutes for our food.  Not unreasonable,but considering the amount of people there, kinda surprised.  My girlfriend is a little picky about thinks so when we go to a Mexican restaurant she always has the same thing, two cheese enchiladas with diced onion on top. I know everyone has there own version of things, and they claim to be authentic Mexican food, but NOT EVEN CLOSE.  The enchilada sauce looked and tasted like it was tomato based. It had similar flavors of enchilada sauce but that's were it stopped.  I had the steak chimichanga and it was a lot of fat on the steak.  At least for my taste.  When the manager came by to see why she didn't like it, he was very defensive and almost seemed rude about claiming, this is how we do it.  Well I get that but then how can you say your authentic Mexican if you do it your way.  In short I don't recommend this place and we will never come back.  It's a shame this doesn't have negative stars on it",

Since this change in hands, the food quality has dropped off a bit. It's still good, but not as good as it used to be and for the price you pay there, that's not a good thing. The one thing that bothers me most about this place and will probably cause us to seek out a new Mexican restaurant in our area is the fact they have a \"lunch\" menu that's really just a shortened version of their dinner menu with no break in price. There are no \"lunch specials\" like you'd find at any restaurant, but especially a Mexican restaurant. We have one more \"living social\" type coupon we're going to use up there and then we're done.",

I was served two crispy burned pork loins floating in a bland \"peanut\" sauce that tasted like it belonged more on a Thai menu.  The plate was over sauced, the \"queso mashed potatoes\" were bland and as hard as a rock...  Then there were the slightly burned, out of season asparagus, no crisp to them, just limpy old food.  To make matters worse, my wife's dish was inedible.  She was served, no joke, instant rice with dried peas and carrots.  They at least squeezed some lime juice on it.  The vegetables in the soggy tortillas were over cooked to the point that they were little rubber bits of bitter tasting vegetables.  We're not picky eaters, but this honestly was an insult served to us on a plate.  I would have sent it all back but our server quickly grabbed our plates and bagged it up for us after she saw we weren't eating.  This was honestly the worst meal I have ever been served that came out of a professional kitchen.  Take my advice, drive five more minutes down the road and go to Senor Tequila.",

It was shrimp and scallops with some kind of corn and cilantro aioli? (Maybe lol). He warned that we probably shouldn't share, but we decided to anyway. He was right. Two shrimp. Two scallops. On a PILE of corn. On top of that the shrimp were tough. (Also not worth the price. Close to $30) So I ordered some some chicken dish that was a chicken breast filet with a small wing attached? (Again maybe...lol). It came with potatos and peppers. It was a little bland. I'm glad we had a great waiter. Other than that it's nothing you should be in a hurry to get to.",

    "text": "Today we enjoyed a late lunch at Cantina 1511.  We were in the super South Charlotte area, and I never turn down unlimited chips and salsa, so we ended up here!  I have been to other Cantina 1511s but never this location.    We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and it was pretty slow so we had a choice of tables.  Chips and salsa came quick, I asked for the spicy salsa and they brought a habanero that both me and my husband loved so much we had refill 3x!  We loved our tacos, I had a carnitas and a pulled chicken taco, he had three other types.  I especially enjoyed the slaw it came with, I wish it came with more!  The rice and black beans also had amazing flavor.  It was also mixed with a few peas, carrots and corn.  I'd definitely get their tacos again!  Service was ok- my husband had to ask for his drink as it was forgotten.  With how quiet it was, that surprised me!  Delish food, for sure, but I was somewhat turned off by the 91% sanitation rating hanging when you walk in.  Hopefully they will improve that soon!",

Love the habanero and their regular red sauce.  Great service, fair prices, all the staff is very nice and friendly. They are fast, very great attention to detail when orders are customized. Vince, great guy as well, i think he is one of the managers, very professional and I've seen him on the floor making sure everything is in order, he even took care of a to-go order for us once and I point this out because we are from Puerto Rico and you don't really see managers working hard and hands on.   My wife loves their chips too and we buy them in catering domes for us or for any party or get together that we are invited and we really make a huge impression.",

During the call, I made them aware that we had a special request for a more secluded table because due to a medical condition.  I was hoping for a corner table or even one that stretched along a wall.  To my surprise (and delight!) they seated us at one of their glass-enclosed tables.  It was like having a room all to ourselves!  Our server, Matt, took amazing care of each and every one of us.  He kept our drinks and chip baskets full.  Our meals were perfect and everyone had a delightful time.  I cannot say enough about the top-notch service we received here!

    "text": "My husband chose to celebrate Father's Day dinner here, so we finally revisited this popular destination located in Stonecrest at Piper Glen.   This used to be our go-to Mexican restaurant in town, but got sick of the long line and opted to go elsewhere for the longest time. Well, this time around, I made a fairly early dinner reservation in advance...and we slid right in!  The place seemed a little more colorful this time around. Think they might have redecorated since our last visit? Still, some of the booths seemed marked up with crayons/pens (probably by children); and they were in dire need of renovation!   Anyway, we were escorted to a huge booth by the window (love these huge booths!); and we began our Mexi fiesta with the complimentary Nachos and Dip.   For my entree, I ordered the 3-Tacos platter (\"Johnny Carnitas\", \"Carne Asada\" and the \"Korean BBQ Beef\"), which of course, came with Mexi Rice and Beans. Well, all I can say is WOW. Can't remember the last time I had tacos that were THIS good...all three tacos were equally Dee-Lish!! I also loved their rice, and even their beans (given that I'm not a fan of Beans). Here, they also offer you the option to choose the type of tacos AND the type of beans!  My husband chose the Enchiladas de Pollo, and my son had Ancho Chicken Quesadillas...and they both seemed to love them as well.  The service was good. Not exceptional, but not bad either. Surprisingly, the place wasn't as bustling as I expected it to be...especially for Father's Day. But as we were leaving, close to 7:30 pm, I noticed that the crowd definitely got bigger.  Overall, we had a truly fulfilling, satisfying meal. We left thinking that maybe we've given up on this place a tad too soon. Yep...we'll be back!",

I picked up on his accent and we struck up a conversation about Boston/New England as my husband and I are from there originally, as well. Really nice guy!  Food was very good. We ordered table-side guacamole and queso. We're eating low-carb so our server brought us veggies to dip instead of chips. My husband ordered the Steak & Chicken fajitas (sans tortillas) and I had the carne asada. Everything was delicious!",

Granted the original was on East Blvd, but I believe the menu is similar.  The dining room is such a large space, there are dividers that have curtains so maybe you can rent out corners or pockets of the restaurant for private parties.  There's a revolving door as the entrance which is totally unique to a restaurant in the \"burbs.\"  I bet 90% of the people use the side doors anyway - Maybe a Charlotte thing, but the only revolving doors I've come across are uptown (and hardly anyone uses them as well).  We were greeted at the host stand and promptly seated (we were also there on an \"off\" peak time... 4:30pm so super early dinner.  Our server was friendly and we had a nice meal.  I had the enchiladas suizas and my  mom had two tacos.  Since we were there early, the restaurant felt a little empty, but it seemed like more and more people were coming in as we were leaving.  It was also a weekday.  Never-the-less, I'm a fan of this option here in Stonecrest, granted there is a Chipotle and other fast food options.",

    "text": "We go to the Cantina at Park Road quite a bit since we live close to it.  My Husband and I came to the Cantina at Stonecrest for a Surprise Birthday Party.  The food was good, this review is strictly based on the service and experience.  The reason for the two star review is because of the bizarre situation that occurred when we finished eating.  The waitstaff did a decent job with our big party, but didn't keep track of what we ordered.  At the end of the meal we waited for a really long time for our checks.  Before our checks were brought out the staff asked what we ordered.  It was really unorganized and confusing for everyone trying to leave to get home to their children.  We left at different times due to some couples having to get home to relieve babysitters.  After everyone had paid and half of the party had left, the manager came out and announced to everyone that we did not meet the $800 minimum for reserving the room and there was a $40 tab worth of drinks that needed to be paid.  We thought this was so wild because the wait staff didn't put those unclaimed items on our checks.  We had no idea there was anything that was not paid for and we would all more than gladly cover the tab.  The manager did this in front of the party instead of just pulling the gentleman aside that had reserved the room.  It was really embarrassing and unprofessional.  We also found it hard hard to believe that we didn't meet the minimum as each couple (13 total) spent an average of $75.    I absolutely hate giving a two star review but the manager didn't apologize and it made the end of the evening very awkward and uncomfortable for our entire group that had just spent a lot of money.",

Not sure what we got. It was a small pot if melted cheese. Not slightly melted, but a liquidy mush and if there was chorizo in it it was so finely chopped we couldn't see it. We expected to be able to wrap the cheese into the flour tortillas we got but instead, we could only dip them because the cheese was so loose. It tasted like cheese whiz with salt.  We waited about twenty minutes for the two bartenders to see if we needed another round but they ignored us. One yapping about himself for a half an hour with two women and the other just running around past us about thirty times. Even after we stood up to signal we were ready to leave it took too long get the check. Terrible food and service.",

The waitress called the manager over (I don't ever ask for them) and he was apologetic and offered an appetizer and faster service, great on his part but I was set on leaving.

As I've stated before cantina's fit and finish is quite good, it presents like a Disney theme restaurant. It wasn't too busy on a Saturday at 5:00. We ordered the kids chicken burrito, kids chicken quesadillas, steak burrito bowl, and fish tacos with queso as a starter. The food itself arrived in a fair amount of time and service was friendly and attentive. The food itself was more of the issue this time our. The queso was actually quite good. The burrito bowl was soupy however and the beef over cooked and dry. The chicken in both kids dishes was a bit spicy for little people and also very dry. The fish tacos was the line bright spot which my wife reported as very good. When we got the bill I was also surprised to see that the queso was $10, which was more of my fault as I should have looked at the price when the server offered it. Still though a little pricey for some cheese. In all I might not make it a point to go back when in the area again as there are lots of food options around that need exploring.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here on a Sunday evening. We arrived at 7:30pm after seeing a movie at the Regal in the same complex. What a disappointment honestly! We didn't select this restaurant based off of Yelp reviews, but instead we came here out of convenience.  We started off ordering two house margaritas on the rocks, 1 with salt and 1 without. Both came with salt and I was disappointed but didn't even point it out to the waiter because I didn't want to be \"that person.\"    We didn't order an appetizer because we had popcorn at the theater so we smacked on the complimentary chips and salsa which were tasty. Chips were crisp and lightly salted. Salsa may have been jarred or homemade but had a kick to it.   We decided to try the date night special for $25 where we could each pick an Entree from a limited menu and then could share a dessert. I ordered a chimichanga with steak and specifically asked for no sour cream. My husband ordered a chimichanga with chicken with everything on it.   The food came out about ten minutes later. (Almost too fast?) The waiter handed me what seemed to be the correct plate until we cut into it and found they reversed our orders. So then we had to switch plates and I had to scrape the sour cream off of mine. This may not seem like a big deal however the sour cream was touching the slaw and lettuce in addition to touching the beans and queso that was spilling over the chimichanga. I personally abhor sour cream so I was really annoyed.    Then I noticed I had about a teaspoon of guacamole on my plate AND no pico de Gallo. Meanwhile my husband had generous portions of each. I was pretty annoyed at this point. The waiter bought me a tiny thing of pico de gallo which was appreciated. Honestly the food wasn't very good anyway and the guacamole tasted pretty bland.   The churros that accompanied the meal took longer than the meal did to come out and that's probably because they were over fried. The Melba sauce served on the side tasted like something poured out of jar or bottle and was extremely sweet.    All in all, I was very disappointed with attention to detail and the taste/quality of the food served. We will not be back.",

The food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. The manager did apologize and gave us this weird dessert that no one liked. The store was not busy at all, and we saw a lot of other people looking around for their food too.  Would not recommend to go go any later, if this was the case at 515.",

The Drag N Berry was very syrupy/heavy but had good flavors and was heavy on the alcohol. Would have rather had homemade lemonade with a shot of something but they were out of lemonade. Love their taco selection - great combinations. I had a puerco al pastor, that had pork and pineapple (yum) and another that was brisket cooked in red sauce. They have a couple of good Mexican beers on tap, and had $3 blue moons as the special. We had a very nice relaxed meal with an attentive waiter. Try it you'll like it!!",

Typically, I wouldn't choose to go to a Mexican place for an expensive dinner since I believe you can get really good Mexican food for cheap at other places, but this place had good reviews and was worth a shot so we went.  Everything we had for dinner was delicious.  We started off with the guacamole.  I was at first disappointed with the small portion, but as soon as I saw the portions of the rest of our meal, I was glad I didn't waste my appetite on just the first course!  I had their salad while my husband had the soup and both were very tasty.  We were already getting pretty full from appetizers when our main courses came out and they were just...OMG.  If you go, you MUST try the short rib.  Juicy, tender, full of flavor and HUGE!  We ended up having to take most of our meal home because we wanted to save it for another day!  The server was also so amazing and attentive.  I mentioned I was allergic to nuts and the dessert they had slated for the Restaurant Week menu had nuts and he was able to replace it with the bread pudding instead, and the bread pudding was literally the best that I've ever had in my entire life.  I would go back just to have the bread pudding again.  Again, I tend to be pretty critical of places and even some of my favorite places I've only given four stars, but had such a great experience here, it definitely deserves five stars and another visit!",

I think Cantina 1511 is ridiculously expensive, given the quality of the food!  Again, the food isn't bad though.  It's just average.  Let me give you an example.  I went there to eat with my wife and two kids.  The kids are under 10 years old.  We ordered some guacamole for appetizer, I had a beer, my wife had a mixed drink, the kids had lemonade.  One of the kids had one taco, the other had the quesadilla appetizer for dinner.  My wife and I each had a regular entree.  The bill was $71!  I can think of a lot of better meals we all could have had for $71!  This is the second time I have been to Cantina 1511.  Friends of mine seem to really like the place.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "Thanks to all the Yelper's,  as we chose this restaurant for tonight's adventure.  You ask why I call it an adventure......because you never know the service that I am going to receive.  I started today's adventure via yelp, I investigated a few reviews, visited the website via yelp, and then placed my reservation online for 7pm.  Being that this was our first time here we arrived promptly at 6:54pm, we were greeted by three lovely young ladies at the hostess stand. We were seated immediately, in what I will refer to as the Tarzan room. (they must have known of my wild adventures in previous posts on yelp)  Our servers name was Ryan, he was very kind, polite, and efficient with his tasks of serving our needs of tex-mex food.  He asked if this was our first time in and of course, we replied yes. He was familiar with the specials and stated that if we needed any assistance with the choices he would be very willing to assist.  He allowed just enough time to look over the menu, and returned promptly to take our order.  Tonight's meal included 2 beef tacos, and the Mexican City Steak Fajitas. ( I have included a picture of my meal) Our drinks were Coke and water, he was very prompt with the refills.  The restaurant was very busy tonight, but the food was hot, fresh and very timely in it's arrival to our table. Unlike many of my other dining experiences, it is becoming less of an adventure and more of a tour of how a restaurant should be, efficient, and friendly.  The tortillas were very nice, fresh, crisp, and the salsa was very pleasant, not too hot, not too mild.  As momma bear says.....it was just right.  The music other Yelper's speak of was not much of a concern to us as we were in a separate room away from the main dining area. Our conversations were easily heard and was not too loud as others suggest.  When the meal came out, the portions were very reasonable, it was hot fresh, and very appealing.  My senses were blasting.  From the  sound of the fajitas, the smell of fresh cooked vegetables on a very hot skillet and the taste.....oh my it was delicious. ( It looks better than my photo as I did not want to use the flash)  The texture was very good, and I enjoyed the small side plate of fajita accessories which consisted of cheese, sour cream, lettuce, dices tomatoes, carrots, guac,  and onions. I needed more fajita bread, and our server had these delivered at no additional charge.  Based on this experience, I will provide 4 stars, it was less of an adventure, and more of an enjoyable night out.  Thanks Cantina 1511, for providing an easy and enjoyable meal, and for all you Yelper's who have not tried this place, go ahead, give 'em a try.  They have a beautiful patio, good food, nice atmosphere, and good service.  I may just have to use this experience as my gauge for 4 stars, I just can't see how tonight could have been much better.

I made a reservation thinking it would be packed (wasn't). Our waiter was pretty impatient and wouldn't stick around to hear 3 people order. He showed us the drink menu but kept walking away before we could order. He snapped at my mom when she asked for a regular margarita instead of telling him the name of the one she wanted. He asked her to refer to the menu that he previously showed her. It was pretty rude and awkward. Her margarita ended up being straight sour mix and it the worst drink I've ever seen prepared (just graduated college and those bars make a better marg).... We kept getting baskets of chips that were only crumbs, which was frustrating. When we got our food it was a lot. The ingredients seemed fresh and well prepared. I wouldn't say it was anything special though. The price is pretty high for what it is. I probably wouldn't go back and from the looks of it they probably won't be there much longer. Next door had a lot more business. Poor service, expensive food. Do not recommend",

As someone who lived in Texas for most his life and relocated to Charlotte by way of the northeast I was in great need of good Mexican.  Sadly I never got the chance due to logistics.  The food maybe good but I never got the opportunity to eat.  Upon arrival at 6pm my party of 4 were told it was to be 30 min.  Well that's acceptable.  45 min later we finally asked the status and the repose was 10 more min.  Where's the apology?  Well 10 minutes pasted and still not seated.  In actually a party of 5 whom arrived approx. 15 min after our arrival was seated.  So needless to say we walked.  A restaurant makes money on turning tables and Mexican restaurants typically do a great job at this due to the nature of Mexican food.  However, Cantina 1511 does not have logistics and management in place.  I hope to give it another go as the Mexican food choices in Ballantyne is very limited with Cantina 1511 cornering the market.  Know that my review is only to help as I want this place to succeed.",

We went last night, for the first night of QF 2013 and had a blast. Our waiter, Javier, was attentive and really wonderful. If we go back, we'll ask for him again.  The food was amazing. For the first course, they serve you guacamole with your chips. For two people, you get a smaller bowl of guacamole than they usually make tableside, and it was really just mixed together at the table, not anything else. At first I was hoping for more, but I was only able to eat about a third of my entree by the time it arrived so really, the amount ended up being more than either of us needed.  I ordered the jicama and avocado salad for my 2nd course. It was HUGE! My husband ordered one of the soups which was also a generous portion. By the time my main arrived, the non-vegetarian enchilada dish, I was already nearing full. I ate a respectable third, but needed the rest to go in order to enjoy the Bananas Foster chimichanga they served along with ice cream at the end.  For wine, we had a bottle of the Pinot at $13, I think it was. For our normal dining out experience, it was a tad pricey (we normally don't eat anything but a main, maybe $15 per person) but for a Queen's Feast splurge the meal was generous and delicious, and the service was great.  Be sure to make a reservation, though! The place was packed.",

The highlight of the meal to me was the salsa and queso. The queso comes with a little tealight to keep it warm. If that tealight goes out have someone re-light it soon, because the queso will become thick and not easy to eat once it gets cold.   Overall a great place for some Mexican, but I think I would rather go to a more authentic restaurant.",

This week I had the chance to go two nights in a row. Both experiences were wonderful--the service (thanks Stan), the drinks and the food. I really like the made fresh guacamole. My coworker from Peru liked the habanero salsa so much she got some to go. Maybe it won't always be twice a week, but I'll eat at Cantina 1511 again.",

    "text": "Well, after perusing the Queen City for burritos and free chips and salsa on any occasion, Cantina 1511 has popped up on my radar a few times. Known for pitchers of sangria and fresh, tableside guac, it might as well be a bulls eye.   We've stumbled in on multiple occasions to this location. Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Optimal time for us is a weekend afternoon. Not buzzing with margarita vultures and other seekers of neon drinks with umbrellas in them. We're just here for the food, typically. However, I've seen quite a few neon blue margaritas floating around. They must be doing something right. Just not my cup of tea....er...booze.   My wife and I love the mushroom and goat cheese quesadilla. Perfectly simple and just enough pungent flavor to keep everything interesting. The goat cheese works perfectly with crispy, buttery outer shell of the tortilla. It's somewhat phyllo-esque upon each bite. So flaky and fragile. The mushrooms could be sauteed a bit better, but the flavors are all there. Huge win.   The tableside guac is an absolute win. Perfect amount for a table of four or two starvacious diners. Balanced well with tomatoes, onion and citrus. I'm not a huge fan of guac that has too many additives. Cantina does it up right. Smooth avocado and the rest of the veggies take care of the chunky aspects. My only gripe is the chips they give you to dip with. Not flat. All folded and intermingling with one another. I want my chips to be separate. Playing by their own rules. Not hugging one another. The flavor is all there. Just too much fraternization.   Love Cantina. Now, to expand my horizons and check out some of this ever-present booze they have going on. Cheers!",

The first time was no big deal - they brought out beef nachos instead of chicken and so we had the waitress switch it out. The second time they messed up on my wife's quesadilla and brought out chicken instead of carne asada. When we told the waitress about the mistake, she did not know that carne asada was different than chicken. When she got her manager she asked if she could send a carne asada quesadilla home with us. We said ok, my wife can just eat at home. When we got our bill, they charged us for the quesadilla that they were sending home with us. Even though my wife wasn't even going to be able to eat her food at the restaurant, they charged us full price. We had a coupon so we used that to get a discount. When we were leaving the restaurant, the manager stopped by and I let her know I was disappointed that they charged us for the quesadilla she said she was sending home with us. She just offered to give us our coupon back and never once apologized and made us feel like it was our fault for the mess up. Very terrible customer service. Needless to say we won't be going here anymore.",

I do, though, want to warn y'all about their online ordering - I've used it about 3 times now, and they've never got my order correct. Tonight, for example, I ordered 2 Ancho Pollo tacos, no pico de gallo and not lettuce, and then another 2 taco plate of 1 Ancho Pollo, 1 Marco Pollo. What we received was 2 orders of the 2-taco plates, both with 2 Ancho Pollo tacos with everything - so they didn't affect the modifications to the first order, and they got the 2nd plate only half correct. When I've ordered by phone, the order has always been correct, so I guess I'll forgo the online ordering if favor of the good old fashioned telephone - since clearly they don't have their house in order there.  Love you, Cantina, but if you're going to enter the 21st century, I encourage you to get it right. It's just annoying to offer online ordering and get the order more than 1/2 wrong.",

We ended up walking out of the place we were currently eating at and booked our table at Cantina before we had even paid the chevk. Chips are outstanding, margaritas are fresh and I'm never disappointed. Our server Scott was very friendly and incredibly helpful with picking a tequila. It might not seem \"authentic\" since it's a chain but it certainly is. If you're looking for good, fresh tasting Mexican, this is the only place we've found in Ballantyne that delivers A+ every time.",

We had the fajitas. I was not really that impressed at all. The fajitas were just okay, we've definitely had better at chain restaurants in California like El Toritos. Someone here on Yelp said the chips and salsa were good - and I would strongly DISagree! They were passable and the salsa was NOT. The salsa was pretty much for local gringos, not at all for California gringo transplants - we LOVE good Mexican food, and I don't think I will return here. If you want good authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place. If you want \"americanized\" Mexican food, then this is a good spot for you.

Chips were crisp and yummy. I had the mushroom quesadilla  which was outstanding.  Like I said, I wouldn't recommend sitting in the bar area unless you have to.

He brought out chips but they were out of containers for the salsa so we had to wait about 10minutes for salsa and I will say it was well worth the wait! The salsa is delicious! We ordered the house margaritas that was also really good and fairly strong! So the reason for the 2 stars, the delicious salsa and margaritas. Now for the food.....I ordered the enchilada suiza.

The staff quickly got us one of their private rooms pulled together and had us seated. Honest people: 1 Liars: 0. The food was ridiculously amazing. Everything from the at the table guacamole with bacon and jalapenos to ever entree was dilicious. Our waiter Stan M. #1107 (this guy needs a promotion) was very courteous, funny and had an all around approachable and comical personality that made us feel at home. We all left full, happy and the trip made our evening. Will most definitely be going back for more of their dilicious food!",

    "text": "STOP MESSING WITH CHIPS AND SALSA!  So on two recent occasions I've been here and the chips are different.  I, like many others, am a huge fan of Cantina's chips and salsa.  Chips are salty white corn tortilla chips and salsa is just plain awesome.  Family went on Saturday morning and were given these cheap crappy unsalty bland YELLOW corn tortilla chips.  You know, the ones you get at most cheap Mexican restaurants.  The first time this happened (maybe four months ago), I pointed it out to the waiter who effectively told me I didn't know what I was talking about and acted all coy.  When it happened on Saturday, waitress told me sometimes the new people overcook the chips.  I don't know if the restaurant runs out of the good chips and has to settle for the crappy chips but there is effort being made to conceal the fact that they are using inferior chips.  A conspiracy I tell ya!  Anyway, for real, the chips and salsa are the main reason I come here, and if I'm going to be flipping a coin every time I show up as to whether I'm going to be happy, I'll have to find somewhere else to eat.",

Once seated, our server Luke was definitely helpful and on point with his drink and taco suggestions though.   We had the street corn as an appetizer, total waste of $4. Corn on the cob (probably the smallest I've ever seen), lathered in oil and a sprinkle of cheese. I was expecting at least a juicy piece of corn and all the things that would make it almost worth spending $4 for & even more so \"Mexican Street Corn\". I had the shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and opted for sweet plantains instead of beans ($2 upcharge). Tacos were pretty tasty (that's what the one star is for), plantains were burnt on some ends and they were all stuck together. Saffron rice would've been good had I not chomped on a few hard clusters of rice.   I went back on yelp and saw the South Park location had better reviews - because I really wanted to like this place,  I'm willing to give Cantina 1511 another shot but at the South Park location. One star for the tacos alone.",

After dinner was over, we looked toward dessert (it was Valentine's Day so some chocolate seemed appropriate) only to be informed that 3 of the 5 desserts listed were also unavailable- apparently a major menu 'revamp' is in the works, but for now you can basically have some key lime pie.

We love the burgers on the menu, I believe these were added to the menu in the past year or so. The guacamole made table side, the quesadillas, fajitas, tacos - everything is fantastic.

This location is seriously in my no fly zone just based off how bad the service is here. Our food has always taken way longer than it should and some part of our order is inevitably screwed up. The wait staff and front desk are super friendly, but god help me something needs to change about the dine-in service.   Aside from the service, Cantina 1511 doesn't do anything particularly well. The Margaritas are usually over-priced and too sugary. The food is fine, but not anything better than any other Mexican restaurant int the Charlotte area. Truthfully, the only reason we went this weekend was because it was close, and we are SUPER lazy.   I wouldn't necessarily recommend against Cantina, but I wouldn't go out of my way to tell people to go here.",

It ended up being a high top table and they just cleaned off the cups and plates from the people before us. It's first come first serve for that whole area - there's booths, the bar, and a few long tables. The queso was really good and filling. I got the chicken quesadilla and I am not kidding, it was THE BEST quesadilla I've had in my life. Definitely coming back when I'm in the area again.",

    "text": "Ok, I'm going to start of by saying our waitress was super friendly, and my friend and I received our lunch fairly quickly.   1. The Guacamole: Cantina offers table side guac, which is great for those who love their guac freshly made. You can't really mess up guac, or maybe you can. In this instance, she did. The guac was flavorless and kind of soupy. I'm not sure how the soupy part happened, but it did. Maybe the pico de gallo was missing cilantro or something? SOMETHING WAS MISSING and I can't put my finger on it. And I won't. I'll never order their guac again.   2. Chicken Tostada Salad: According to the menu, this salad is piled high with marinated chicken breast. Um, where was the chicken? I barely received any and I for sure didn't receive any marinated chicken. The chicken on my salad looked like cubed chicken that came out of a can. Totally underwhelmed and disappointing.   3. Churro Bread Pudding: What in the bland heck is this? I've never tasted a dessert that had absolutely no flavor. Our waitress suggested it to us and said it was the best dessert on the menu. Well, if this is the best dessert on the menu, I don't ever want to taste any of the other desserts. Ever.   If you couldn't tell, I love flavor. I love spices. When I go to a Mexican restaurant, or any restaurant, I expect for my tastebuds to be happy.   Maybe if I ordered a taco or a burrito, maybe I would have had a better experience? Who knows? I don't know - and I will never know, because I will not be back.",

No fault of hers but food service is a team effort. We were there at 4:00 on a Monday afternoon, the restaurant was not busy. Dirty tables all around our section of the restaurant that were not attended to. Both of our orders were wrong but we didn't bother to complain because it seemed pointless and figured no one would help since everyone in this restaurant had a \"one for all\" mentality.",
