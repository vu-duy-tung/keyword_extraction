I normally wouldn't harp on it being a game night. But the place was Empty. Smh. The wings were hot and charred. The sauces were tasty as well. Hung had the Q platter with the ribs/sausage links and for sides baked beans and  okra. I had the pull pork plate with the mac and cheese and okra. The BBQ was all well seasoned and easy to consume. The MAC and Cheese was very creamy and had a homemade taste. Okra was crisp and fresh. Overall good experience. Appetizers were reasonable $6-10 and entrees ranged $12-$20. Overall would return.",

It's that freakin good.   After I ate the dam sandwich I didn't remember why I was there in the first place.   All I was thinking about was that delicious lip smacking sandwich.  Wait, what was I talking about again? Oh yea the freakin brisket,  I couldn't tell you how anything else was because I can't stop thinking of the brisket,  brisket.   Now get off your fat ass and get to the stadium to eat.",

    "text": "I was introduced to Queen City Q as part of Feast Food Tour's \"Soul of the South\" tour. Our group was served pulled pork sliders and craft beers with our choice of any and all of their six sauces, and they were amazing! These sliders were tender, flavorful, and served with a nice slaw on top between a perfectly toasted, slightly buttery, bun. The sauces were delicious and unique, too. The food was so good, my sister and I decided to come back for dinner the next day.  For dinner, I had the light meat chicken with a side of collard greens and corn maque choux served with Texas toast. The corn maque chouz was buttery, spiced well and delicious. The collard green were overcooked and bland. But the chicken was the most disappointing. It was dry and flavorless. So so so incredibly dry, even the sauce couldn't revive it (it ended up just tasting like the individual sauces). Though I'm sure they're likely not known for their smoked chicken, I hate paying money for bone dry chicken. (I always have chicken at home and manage to keep even light meat flavorful and juicy.)  However, despite the mediocre chicken, because very few people come here for the chicken, I'm sure, the corn and the pulled pork sliders were so good, I gave them four stars.",

Their veggie burger was very basic and a little boring. I would stay clear of it, there are many other places in town that make it way better! However all their sides are amazing!  Great hush-puppies with honey butter, fantastic fried okra, and great mac & cheese!    If you're a vegetarian, I recommend just filling up on sides. It's totally worth it.",

    "text": "I had the good idea to come check out this place as a way to wait for traffic to die down after a Bobcats game...  I couldn't have picked a better place!   I love the layout... There are multiple bars with plenty of seating and enough televisions to ensure a comfortable viewing from any place inside... One of my favorite things is that they even have specials on the weekends!  $1.75 for domestics is a great deal on a day when most places get rid of their discounts... They have a great showing of local brews as well... Everyone from Birdsong, OMB, NoDa Brewing and Four Friends are in the building and they have quite a few NC players as well...  Big Boss, Carolina Brewing, Foothills, Highland, LoneRider (YUM), Natty Greene's and RJ Rockers...  I love all the craft brewing in my state!  The servers are lots of fun and actually dress in Bobcats gear on game nights which I thought was a pretty cool touch...  I believe my female bartender's name is Jody and I know the guy's name was Joe... They were both helpful without hovering and provided wonderful suggestions...   Since the first time, I've been back twice... lol  The first time I had the Q Burger... It's a mixture of ground beef and barbecue as a burger... It was absolutely delicious... The sweet potato fries were out of this world as well... Nice and crisp with no residual greasiness... The boyfriend had the pulled pork with the macaroni and cheese and french fries... (He loves his starches...)  The sauce he used was uber tasty... I think it's called PoPo Bonz or something like that... It was sweet with a kick... I actually stuck some on my burger and it was yummy... The next time we went, they were offering the late night menu... I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, but had a raging headache, so I couldn't even eat... No problem, guys... Let me tell you, the food heats up for a second go round awesomely! lol  I popped the bun in the toaster and the barbecue in the microwave with the collard greens... Those greens are probably my favorite thing on the menu now... Bold greenery flavor with a nice peppery undertone... Mmm...  The last time I stopped in on a Thursday to watch the draft... (Note: $3 Guinness on Thursdays!) I had a smoked sausage hoagie this time with the collards again as my side... They were just as good as before... They make their sausage in house and it was some of the best I've had...  It was fresh and absolutely out of this world satisfying... It comes with mustard and slaw, which wasn't all mayonnaisey... It was a perfect meld of flavors...   They also do a trivia night, either in their back room or on the patio if it's nice enough... Fabulous!  They have a live band on Friday and a poker game on Wednesday...  This is absolutely one of my favorite places...  I totally recommend it...",

She took our order and made 2 more visits during our time not including the delivery of our check. Again the food was good, but the wait staff this afternoon was more interested in socializing than attending to the guests.",

    "text": "This place makes its own sauces, which is always a good sign for a BBQ joint.  All of the sauces have a bit of a zing to them, and the Southern tendency toward vinegar-based sauces is well-represented.  Nice selection of local and craft beers both bottled and on tap (lots of IPAs, too, for you hoppy fans).  A selection of innovative cocktails is also available, including a pomegranate martini that goes nicely with the food.  The St. Louis style pork ribs are tasty and tender.  Pulled pork is very generous in portion (you'll probably take some home) and excellently spiced.  Caesar salad is fresh and comes with thinly sliced parmesan on top (like it's supposed to), although the dressing itself is a bit bland.  I highly recommend the hushpuppies, which are divine and taste great alone although they are served with honey butter.  The pork rinds are clearly those crispy ones out of a bag, but served warm with a seasoning that we spent the evening trying to identify.  Definitely a mixture of sugar and pepper, but also something else with a bit of a zip (chili powder?).  Inexpensive and low-carb snack if you're drinking beer.  The corn maque choux is outstanding.  Basically it's what happens when Cajuns get a hold of creamed corn.  A bit of onion, green pepper, tomato, bacon, and possibly a hint of jalepeno mixed into corn niblets in a cream sauce.  One of my companions had the baked beans and said they are very good, also.  The \"Texas toast\" is a little sad.  Basically just some lightly browned butter toast with nothing special about it.  Meh.  There are flat panel TVs mounted up over the bar and over the dining room, and we were able to watch one of the Women's World Cup matches while we ate.  This restaurant is also notable for being open on a Sunday night, which seems to be unusual around here.  Our waiter was extremely accommodating of our large group and split checks, and very informative about the various dishes available and the cocktail ingredients.  Prices are extremely reasonable for good BBQ, and I recommend this place for tourists and locals alike.",

    "text": "BBQ as good as it gets in the Queen City! I would eat pulled pork and ribs every single day of my life if I could and Queen City Q is just another reason to do so.   I'm going to skip all the nonsense and get right to the food. The wings are my favorite by far and not because the pork, ribs or brisket aren't just as good but because I am obsessed with grilled wings. Their wings at \"The Q\" are slow-smoked and grilled so they have that perfect charred crispiness on the skin and the meat that just falls off the bone. My favorite sauce on the wings is their Super Hot BBQ but beware!: It's pretty spicy!  The pork is very tender and fills you up easily. The sauces served on the table for you to slather on your good pork eats are finger-lickin' good. The side dishes are a-plenty (there are about a dozen) and my favorites are the mac-n-cheese (duh) and the corn maque choux. (It's a spicy corn. If you've read my reviews you know I get down with the spice!) I personally thought the baked beans were a little too tomato-based for me and the green bean casserole was too cheesy but I've seen some people throw down on that stuff.  The ribs are also another fave of mine. I usually don't order ribs too much when I go out but I had these the first time here and continue to order them almost every time I go back. The meat is incredibly tender, the sauce is sweet and you can taste the smoked goodness in every bite.  I haven't had too much of the menu here because I find it difficult to stray from the best of what I've found so far. I did, however, try the banana pudding. Oh man, was it good! Next time, I'll be sure to try the caramel bread pudding.. I'm sure I need that like another hole in my head but why not?!  *Warning: If you come here to eat on the healthier side, you ain't doin' it. It would be more of a disgrace to come to a BBQ place like this and WANT to eat lean.   The service is very attentive and every waitress I've had has been very sweet. The decor is like uptown barn chic with rich, red walls and wooden tables and booths.  The dining room is very comfortable but it's HUGE! The Q is located where old Lavecchia's used to reside in the 7th St. Station building across from the arena. If you aren't in here during lunch when it's slammed it may seem a little slow but only because it's such a huge space to fill.   Another great bonus: They have a massive beer selection! I don't take advantage of this enough, unfortunately, because I'm always a fatty when I go here and just throw down on BBQ. The 2 bars are loaded with dozens of bottled beers (each priced around 4 or 5 bucks) and a pretty hefty draft selection as well. You would have to come here several times to try the majority of their beers!  Queen City Q is a must for lunch if you work nearby in the uptown area: Super quick service and food delivery when you're on a tight schedule. It's also great for before or after a Bobcats/Checkers game or concert at the arena. *They validate parking for free so it's actually cheaper to pop in even for one beer to get that ticket stamped! Or you can make a fun sports night of this place too. They have quite a number of TV's so you can easily enjoy apps and entrees while sipping on delicious beers and watching a game. If the weather is warm, there is also a bangin' patio right on 6th street for people-watching and sun-basking. I could definitely see myself enjoying a few brews out there with friends on a pretty day!  Bottom line, peeps: You can't go wrong here... especially if you're a BBQ nut like myself! I seriously crave their smoked goodies on a weekly basis.",

    "text": "I was expecting there to be BBQ on every corner since that's what everyone said Charlotte would be like, but I guess there aren't too many in Uptown. Queen City Q is just a super short walk from Times Warner Cable Arena.  There was a Bobcats game the night that we went (3/6/13) but we must've got here before the crowd since there weren't too many people there yet. It is located right next to the Lynx railway tracks. It has a small outdoor patio but the inside is fairly large.   Stephanie was our waitress and she was very friendly. Matt also came by to fill our water as needed. He stopped and chatted with us for a bit about Charlotte and the South. I LOVE how everyone is so GENUINELY friendly and so eager to help or answer any questions as soon as we mention that we're visiting. I love California but this place is just knockin' my socks off with all the southern hospitality! :D  I ordered the hand-pulled pork which is smoked for 16 hours ($12). All entrees come with two sides and Texas toast so I chose the sonia salad (a southwestern salad made with lettuce, corn salsa, black beans, and tortilla strips that is tossed with chipotle ranch) and the sweet potato fries. They give you a ton of pork! Yum! I had lots of leftovers. Be sure to try the different sauces that are on the table. I have to admit that I only tried the Eastern NC sauce. It was the first one I picked up to try and I was in heaven. There was no need to try the others. I am a huge fan of anything vinegar based and that sauce definitely has lots of vinegar! :D It has a little kick to it too. I drowned my leftovers in it before taking it to go. The sonia salad was surprisingly good and you can't really mess up sweet potato fries so they were naturally good as well.  The bf got the St. Louis style pork ribs ($10, $15, $21) with the mac and cheese and the Eastern NC bbq slaw. The ribs were tasty, the mac and cheese was yum, and the slaw was vinegary just like the Eastern NC bbq sauce. These weren't exactly fall off the bone type ribs but they were still good.   The place wasn't that cheap considering that it's BBQ, but they give huge portions and everything we had, tasted great. We're in Uptown for the next couple months so I'm sure we'll be back.",

Queen City was the second restaurant I visited and it definitely did not disappoint.  I got the Big Q platter where you get a choice of three BBQ proteins, I got brisket, ribs and pulled pork, along with 2 sides, I got fried okra and bean casserole.  The brisket was definitely the star of the three meats.  It was tender and moist, probably due in part to the huge amounts of sauce they put onto it; looking back I'd probably ask for the sauce on the side.  The ribs were decent, definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was packed with flavor and just enough BBQ sauce.  It had a good smokey flavor and had a good lean meat to fat ratio. The pulled pork was a bit disappointing.  While it had a great taste, it didn't have a smokey flavor even though it was supposedly smoked for 16 hours.  Further more the pork was very dry and could have used a bit of sauce.  But over the three proteins together were satisfying and in huge portions. The sides were very comforting, something that could have come out of grandma's kitchen.  The green casserole was savory and delicious.    While this place probably isn't the best BBQ place in Charlotte, as proclaimed on their website, it's definitely a place you should visit if you're in town and have a craving for BBQ.",

I sent the sausage back because it was cold. When I got it back it looked like it had been run over by a dump truck. I had to cover it up with a napkin because it looked so awful and was burned. I sent it back. The next one was even worse. Burnt to a crisp and dripping with grease. The waitress said \"we smoke our meats\". Cigarette smoke no doubt. The pulled pork was in a pool of tasteless grease and it had NO FLAVOR. The toast had no butter on it. The BBQ sauces spilled a teaspoon of water on my plate before the sauce came out. It was not worth the trouble. Don't expect any help from Manager Ryan. He was not helpful and made a smartass remark to me as he walked away after my complaints. \"Enjoy your dining experience\".  DO NOT GO HERE. It cost over $21 and there was less than $5.99 worth of food. They will rip you off.",

From a waitress brining us the check while I was still eating my entree, to a waiter calling my husband \"chief\" multiple times during our meal, to the food taking 30-40 minutes and the sides coming out wrong 3 times for one dinner plate, or forgetting to add any sauces and condiments to our to-go order, and so on. Despite all that, we attempted to go again tonight, hopeful that the service had improved. Did I mention that we really like the food?  When we arrived at 7:10 tonight (Saturday night), there were quite a few open tables and some tables waiting to be bussed - but we were told there was a 20-25 minute wait.  Since there were so many open tables, we asked the hostess why there was a wait. We were told that that the servers were overwhelmed and they couldn't seat any more tables. Given our history with poor service, we didn't want to take the chance on another frustrating dining experience, so we left to eat elsewhere.   So disappointing.",

The interior is pretty cool with multiple bars, a few more intimate booths, and sky high ceilings. This place was much bigger than I expected.   The pulled pork plate was great, the pork retained its juice well and was not dry at all (I'm looking at you Smoke). Nice smoke on the pork as well. I really enjoyed their signature BBQ sauce. It is an eastern Carolina vinegar sauce with more of a tomato sweetness and viscosity.   The sides are what you would expect from a BBQ place. I had the mac and cheese along with the hush puppies. Both were good, but nothing memorable.   I hope to see Queen City Q stick around for a while.",

    "text": "Food: AWESOME- 5 stars Service: Apathetic - 2 stars I have traveled to 50 countries and every state in the union and I ALWAYS try the barbecue, wherever I am. I travel the country every week and usually have 'cue at least once a week.  I've tried it all.  Growing up in Texas, my mom and dad took away my bottle and stuck a pork rib in my mouth!   Being my first time, I tried the Big Q platter to get a taste of a few things.   1. The pulled pork, while just a bit dry from sitting a bit too long, was excellent and plentiful. The basic Pork sauce is a nice mix of tomato and vinegar. 2. Quarter Chicken, Dark meat. Mustard sauce was just the right spice and the chicken was tender and juicy with just the right smoke. 3. Pork Ribs. THE ABSOLUTE BEST ST LOUIS RIBS I HAVE EVERY HAD. They trim them cleanly so they're just the right size and they have a nice char on them from the grill. A light cover of caramelized sauce is the perfect crust.  Baked beans are sweet and the chunks of sausage finishes them just right.  As for the service.....it was after the lunch hour 1:30 or so.  I was waited on by no less than 4 people and they ALL had the most blase attitude. Standing around. Not doing much.  Friendly enough but not interested in me just what I wanted. I had to specifically ask for drink refill. Only about 8 customers there at the time.  I wanted to ask them: \"Are you ignorant or apathetic?\" To which I expected them to reply: \"I don't know and I don't care.\"  What was so clear is that this is how they're managed. I understand wanting to be relaxed in a BBQ joint but this is a strong business with a large kitchen and lots of seats. It needs an energized crew to create a welcoming \"buzz\" in the place. They're pumping out 70 rock hits from Pink Floyd, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, etc. Let's enjoy the environment and not feel like a bunch of 20 somethings have no where better to be.  Again, the 'cue is top star food. Too bad the service doesn't match it.",

We ordered the pork sliders and and the pulled pork dogs. Food arrived promptly which was nice, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. The pork on the sliders was dry and tasted like it had been sitting around a while. The fries were limp and barely warm. The slider buns overwhelmed and further \"dried\" out the sliders. Maybe the slider bread would have been better  if it had been toasted. The pulled pork dogs were equally dry and very salty. The house chips were just plain bad. My friend convinced me to try one. I wish I hadn't. They tasted like they had been fried in old grease. Pretty bad. Our lunch seemed to be made with no love. We were very disappointed. We thought about complaining, but the foul odor from a pile of cigarette butts that the table across from us had created (on the ground under their table) was drifting our way, so we decided to just get our check and leave. (Where's the manager on duty? Is anyone running this place?)  I hope Queen City Q can get their act together but we won't be heading back anytime soon.",

The ribs were cooked exactly the way I like them, moist but not gross with a weird texture. The apricot Bbq sauce was out of this world. The wings were jerk seasoned and ok at best. They seemed overly fatty for my taste but still very flavorful. The star of the happy hour for me was the pulled pork sliders. Put a little popo sauce on them and you won't be able to stop eating them until their finished. It's not your typical NC Bbq joint and that's ok can't wait for my next trip.",

We sat and watched as the bartender chatted with another employee at the other end of the bar and when he was done picked up a cell phone and talked on the phone ignoring the customers.  He then waited on a few customers at the other end of the bar still ignoring us.  When he finally decided to wait on us, I asked for a glass of water and a menu and my sister asked for the beer list.  He gave my sister the beer list and went to the other end of the bar and made a few drinks and chatted with people.  Never gave us a menu and never even looked at us again.  We thought about going over to the hostess and getting a table but I really wanted to see how long he would ignore us. (He was not busy) We watched as a group of people came in after us and sat at the table in the bar area and were waited on by another server.  They had menus and drinks.  We finally decided to leave and he probably didn't even notice.  Saw a lot of great reviews but I guess we will never know.  First and LAST time I will go there.  BTW went around the corner to a different restaurant and had great food and service.",

As my friend and I must try to the wings everywhere, we didn't stop here. We did 6 Po Po wings and 6 jamiacan jerk.  Can I say the Po Po wings are the best wings I have ever eaten in Charlotte?  Well screw you I just did boom!  The jamiacan weren't that bad either as they didnt have that over chivey taste.  Unfortunately we both ordered the brisket ( i would have liked to see another entree), but it worked out in a way.  The sweet potato fries were amazing and the brisket was cooked very well.  We marveled at how well the brisket was.  The only problem I had was the suace was a little too tangy, but my friend thought it was great.  To each their own I guess.  The price wasn't too bad and this will def be a place i repeat.  The only problem I had was parking as there was no parking on any roads that day.",

They were turning over a lot of table last night - Checkers game so lots of Checkers fans there before the game.  Saw a couple of Christmas parties (one in a private room).  Again, no issues with service.  Food was super (buffalo wings, brunswick stew, chicken tacos, ribs, bbq - all yummy).

I've been to three other places with similar offerings that I would choose over this place. I'm just saying.   Anywho, even though it's not the best in the city the food was still good.  Ive been here twice. Once I ordered the smoked wings which were really good because I love smoked wings, but the flavor I ordered was like it wasn't there at all. This most recent visit we started out with the queso. What a let down. It was like dipping a chip in cheesy water or some type of fluid. Note to self don't get queso from a BBQ place. We moved on to the smoked chicken plate. It was decent. The chicken had a nice flavor to it, but nothing to phone home about. It would have been nice if the chicken was pulled instead of on the bone.  I got the hushpuppies and eastern Carolina Cole slaw with my meal. The hushpuppies were the star of this dish, because the honey butter they serve with it is amazing. The coleslaw on the other hand.... I'm a Carolina girl, so first of all we call it red slaw or BBQ slaw! Second of all it was way too spicy to even enjoy, and I like hot!  I probably won't be back here unless it's free lol.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Queen City Q in downtown Charlotte, a short walk from the Time Warner Cable Arena, home of the Charlotte Hornets.   Dora here. My first Hornets game ever! Too bad they lost that night. :)   This BBQ joint/sports bar serves all of our BBQ favorites, burgers, tacos and more. During our visit, most visitors were sporting their Hornets gear while filling up before the game.   We opted to try a few menu items and share: Brunswick stew, hush puppies and honey butter, and Carolina Classic Nachos.  I never pass up Brunswick stew when it's on the menu, and I am glad I did not pass on this one. This stew was outstanding, with just the right mix of meat and vegetables and a flavor that kept me going back for more. I think next time we visit I could make my whole meal on this Brunswick stew.   Dora here. Hmm. I hear you, but I'm quite sure on our next visit, you won't be able to resist the lure of the Que. :)  The Carolina Classic Nachos was loaded with three types of meat (pulled pork, smoked chicken and brisket), lettuce, tomato and chips.   I have nachos at many places, but these nachos have to rank in the top two or three. What separated these nachos from the others had to be the white queso, with just the right amount of kick and mixed well with the different meat combination. In addition, the serving portion is huge. Both of us ate on it, and still weren't able to finish.   Dora here. Huge and delish! I love chili nachos, but the chili version tends to be heavy, so I appreciated the lighter variation. The chips didn't taste overly salty while I ate them, but I could've downed a gallon of iced tea after dinner.   Service was quick and friendly, even jammed with people.   We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Bloggers",

The only thing that was kind of a bummer was the sauces they were very watery and had so much vinegar in all of them. Other than that would recommend to anyone trying to get some good bbq in uptown Charlotte!!! I will for sure be back to enjoy more of the Q",

    "text": "Came to NC for a wedding and after flying almost the entire length of the US we were hungry and looking for something good. Jen found Queen City Q on Yelp and we decided to give it a try.  We had the Q platter which if you are undecided is a great option.  We started with the chicken and bacon quesadilla which was awesome.  The platter was awesome and the brisket, which past experiences have delivered dry and bland, was actually really good.  you could seriously taste the grill which I loved.  my opinion on ribs, which also come on the platter, is that the minimum requirement is that they fall off the bone, after that it's all up to the sauce.  The regular sweet sauce is right up my alley and I loved it, but if you like variety they have 5 or 6 more versions right on the table for you to try.  The topper was that our server along with all the other staff were very friendly and helpful to us tourists looking for things to do.  Even other employees that were doing their side work or.other duties didn't seem bothered my our questions and took more than just a minute to stop and visit with us.  What a great reflection upon not only the restaurant but Charlotte as well.  Anyone looking for good BBQ and very friendly staff must go to Queen City Q.",

It's got a good sized patio area to enjoy the nice spring/summer/fall weather, as well as many tables inside. They have a vast beer selection, which is always welcomed by me. Their BBQ is pretty good, and competitively priced to other BBQ joints around town.    The several times I've come, I've always gotten the hand pulled pork entree. You just can't beat that deal. It's $12, and comes with 2 sides and texas toast. The pork has always been tender and cooked/smoked well. I've yet to have dried out pork here. Their Mac N Cheese is delicious, as is their green bean casserole & hush puppies.   If you're Uptown, I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot!",

    "text": "Continuing on my food tour of Charlotte, Wednesday night found me at Queen City Q. The place was hopping (meaning it was an electric, sort of party atmosphere) but grabbed take-out. I ordered the Medium plate which included three meats and two sides. I chose ribs, chicken and links. And my sides were greens and mac'n cheese.   The meats: 1) ribs were moist and tender to the bone. They weren't \"falling off the bone\" but I don't like my ribs like that anyway; 2) chicken was very flavorful and had that wow-factor; 3) links were nothing short of AMAZING. I don't how they do it, but I've got to say it was probably the most delicious smoked link I ever had.   The sides: 1) Mac'n cheese was just o.k. That bar was set pretty high by this other place I wrote about in another review; 2) Collard greens were some of the best I've had. They were properly prepared and very flavorful. Those are just two of a list of side dishes all of which I can't wait to try. But in general three sides I always use to represent a place are greens, mac'n cheese, and yams/sweet potatoes.   Overall 4-stars for Queen City Q. I'll definitely be back!",

The name and the reviews got me. Obviously, I was not familiar with Uptown Charlotte, or I would have known what I was walking into. The locals probably already know what this is and have calibrated for it, but for those of you coming from out of town... This NOT, I repeat ... NOT a BBQ place. It's a pre-event stadium/arena wings and beer place.... And in that department I think they probably score some pretty high points. But the name says Q. I had the brisket sandwich. It had no smoke coloring, no smoke flavor... And my guess would be that it was cooked 3 days prior to it being served to this sucker. It was surrounded by Sysco French Fries... And packed between a pretty ok roll. So that's it... Stay away if you are looking for legit Carolina Q... If you're just looking for a decent beer selection and some wings, then by all means give it a try. I give it two stars for misleading me with the name. If they were called \"Convenient Arena Wings N Beer\" I probably would have upped the rating two a 3.5. Hope this helps.",

    "text": "I'm quite surprised that more good BBQ doesn't exist in Charlotte! I would have thought, Southern city = Great BBQ. Well, not the case here in Charlotte, until now that is.  Queen City Q is really a great BBQ joint. I had their Brisket for lunch, and let me tell you that it was AWESOME! Super tender, melt in your mouth, and very flavorful!!! Had Mac and Cheese on the side and viola! there was some great BBQ!  Come to find out that it was THESE owners that started Mac's BBQ. BUT, they left to start their own BBQ joint because the owners of Mac's just didn't adhere to the vision. We've been to Mac's, and felt that their BBQ just didn't cut it. And in comparing the 2 briskets, it was UNFAIR, because Queen City Q's knocked out Mac's with one punch!  Thankfully, Queen City Q is walking distance from my Uptown office. Hopefully, others will discover this great BBQ joint. It is off the beaten path, but WELL worth it. Go check it out for yourself. You'll be glad you did!",

    "text": "Look, opinions run strong in this area around BBQ.  I get that.  You may have another and that's okay.  But, for me, I'm thrilled that Queen City Q is open in downtown Charlotte!  Perhaps you can find better BBQ if you want to drive to Lexington or somewhere else in remote areas.  But, I guarantee the difference isn't worth the fuel it takes to start your car or the grain it takes to feed your horse!  This place serves good pork BBQ and several other great meat/entree options too!!  The ribs, brisket, chicken, and even the smoked sausage are all really good!  That's one reason that I love to come here with a group, and just buy platters to share!  I like it all!! Check out that Super Q Platter, get a beer, relax and \"pig\" out!!!  Speaking of beer, take a look at the beer menu!!  Wow!  Lots of craft beers to choose from and maybe try a new one!!  There are 40+ drafts and then lots of bottled beers too!  For me, I'm happy to enjoy my favorite - OMB Copper!  I've eaten a lot of food here, and can tell you that you won't go wrong whatever you order.  It may not be how YOU would make it, but then, you aren't eating at home, are you?  From the appetizer list - the Deviled Eggs w bacon (mmmm), their own Pimento Cheese (another mmmm)!  The hushpuppies  served w/ honey butter are really good, and then one of my favorites - the fried pickles!    There are several great sides to choose from including mac-n-cheese, collard greens, and baked beans w/ Neese's (a Greensboro, NC company) sausage - these are all winners for me!  They have two different kinds of slaw - Low Country and Eastern NC BBQ slaw.  I'll bet the Low Country is good, but I can't get by the Eastern style! And I'll stop there with the sides, cause there's quite a list.  The restaurant has lots of room and the wait staff has always been very attentive!  If you need to hold a secret meeting, or maybe just a private function, they have a room you can reserve.  You can tell, I really like this place!  And to think that it's in downtown Charlotte!!  It is adjacent to a parking garage. And, it's right on the light rail line, so if you uh, don't want to drive home... or if you'd rather ride the rails... you can!  And there is a Charlotte B-Cycle dock right outside the door.  Lots of ways to get here!  So, just get here!",

After eating there I can tell you I will definitely be back (probably after going to hockey or basketball games).  Our waitress was really nice and super attentive but not in that \"if she asks me one more time if i need a refill i will lose it right here\" sort of way, and our food came out to us really quickly. Now usually when my food comes out that fast I question whether or not I should eat it, but I was starving and it turned out to be a good choice in the end. I got the BBQ tacos with mac and cheese and enjoyed it, but added some extra sauce to the tacos myself. They have a few sauces on the table to choose from, which I really appreciated.   It was also cheap and my friend was able to get wasted without spending too much money.",

The wait is the hardest part..... sat down with a group of 6 and it was 10min before a waitress came to get our drink order.  It was then another 20min before she came back for our food order.  Finally after 50min of waiting we were served our food...... but never got a drink refill.  Only reason we stayed is the conversation took our minds off the hunger and time.  Food was good though!  I had the pulled pork plate which was good and the eastern bbq was good too (though would have preferred to seen some Lexington BBQ sauce).  Portion was a great value for the price.  I had onion rings and fries as a side.  Onion rings were good, but not the normal rings I would have expected.  These were really thick cuts, but good.  If they can figure out the service I look forward to eating here again and trying some of the other BBQ options.",

It was really good, can't complain one bit.  The girlfriend actually got a plate of the pulled pork and I stole a bite off her plate (sneaky).  It was good, smokey, moist, etc.  All things as it should be.    Seeing as how this place is the newest of a few uptown BBQ places that are popping up uptown I think I will certainly be back for more.  PS.  Midwood is still my #1, sorry but it's True.  I have to get in my car to get there though :)",

The pulled pork had a really nice smokey flavor, and the sauce selection was really on par (I'm a vinegar-based fan myself). I would say that quality and taste-wise, Mac's is the most comparable. Is it better than Mac's? I'm not prepared to make that judgement yet, but it's saying a lot that I didn't walk away thinking \"Mac's is better.\"  Oh, and based on our server's recommendation and the menu's confidence (it is listed as \"Best Mac and Cheese\"), I got the Mac and Cheese. I have to say, in a city with a LOT of really good Mac and Cheeses, I was thrilled to discover this one really is outstanding.   The staff was friendly and knowledgeable (surprising given the place just opened), the atmosphere is pretty chill and fun, and the bars (plural) look prime for game watching. I was also impressed by the draft selection, with the best-of-the-best domestics and imports right along with some excellent local brews from OMB and NoDa Brewing.   If a few weeks pass and this place lives up to the promise I think it has, this review ought to get bumped up to a 5 star.",

They didn't change the layout so much from La Vecchia's.  Bars are still in the same spots, they have booths and tables and high-tops available too.  A number of large TVs make it seem like a cool place to watch the game.  Outdoor seating will be great in the summer!!  Close to the arena this place will be hoppin during basketball season!  The interior seems lighter and brighter now - super cool red walls and Western-y decor.  Firewood for the smoker (I didn't see it but I didn't really look) on display visibly in the dining room!  Each table has on it several sauces to try.    I had the BBQ platter which came with two sides - I tried the macaroni and cheese and the green bean casserole.  The pork was smokey and tender.  I like to eat mine sans sauce to really taste the flavor.  But I did try the sauces, there was a mustard-y one, regular and a spicy one.  All were very good if you are a sauce person.  The macaroni and cheese was creamy and delish!  The green bean casserole was savory and had tons of fried onions on top.  All portions - super plentiful.    Probably they will validate your parking if you ask - for the parking garage.  We walked so we weren't in need.  So I will definitely be back to this great spot!  Super convenient and very nice service.  Best Q in Charlotte?  Sorry that honor still goes to Midwood Smokehouse.  But this establishment definitely tops Macs in all areas.  I want to try the brisket next!  If their brisket comes close to Midwood then there could be a tie......",

    "text": "Queen City Q is a fairly recent addition to the Charlotte BBQ scene. Located close to the 7th St. light rail stop, it's a perfect place to ride & dine. A few weeks ago Calvin and I walked uptown from our house, participated in a twilight 5K race and had a great dinner here before taking the train back home. If you don't live close enough to walk or take the train, parking is validated in the adjacent deck. In addition to a huge indoor dining room and full bar, there is a nice patio where we sat.  We decided to share an order of the onion rings appetizer and The Q Platter - you could choose up to 4 meats but since we love BBQ pulled pork we doubled up on that and had the brisket and the ribs as well. All of the meats were smoky, succulent and tasty, particularly the St. Louis ribs. It was also a portion big enough for a third person!  Queen City Q has a wide variety of sides including all of the usual suspects plus a few innovative additions like corn & edamame salad. Our chosen sides, mac & cheese and BBQ slaw, were good choices but I'd like to return to try the greens and sweet potato fries. Salads and tacos, two types of chili and Brunswick stew are also offered. I also like that they include Texas toast with the entrees - yum! I look forward to dining here again and trying more menu items!",

While we were here, we got to sample some brisket prepped a couple of different ways.  Both were excellent and offered very distinct flavor profiles!  I ordered the pork plate with mac & cheese and BBQ slaw.  The slaw was very fresh and tangy.  The mac and cheese was absolutely creamy and delightful.  And the pork...  it was most excellent!  Wish I would've gotten a little bit more bark on my plate, but that's not a huge deal.    We got to talk with the owner and the pitmaster.  Everyone was very helpful and polite.

    "text": "Tagged along with a friend to try this place out the first week it opened. Perhaps it was just the opening week kinks, but overall it was all sorts of \"Meh\".  Prior to its inception, everyone had been raving about Queen City Q because it is apparently the brainchild of the same person who founded Mac's. This may seem sacreligious to all a' y'all, but I've always found Mac's to be vastly overrated amongst the local Barbecue community ::dodges rotten tomatoes and pulled pork being tossed in general direction:: Sorry! I just think there are better options out there. (See: Bobbee O's, Midwood Smokehouse)  Still, I approached Queen City Q with an open mind and an open heart. After al, I love me some barbecue! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the \"best Mac and Cheese\". The pork, while plentiful on the portions, was nothing to write home about. Just your basic pulled pork, with the Uptown prices. The \"best\" Mac and Cheese? Hardly. Pretty arrogant of a place that just opened to call run of the mill Mac and Cheese the 'best' on their menu. My friend had the beef brisket, which was decent (again, I've had better), and we were offered a sample of their St. Louis pork ribs which were great for the price (free!), but were greasy and fatty -- I don't see myself paying the $12+ to get it for an entree.  In short, Queen City Q isn't terrible, but what it lacks is the \"I'm definitely going back for......!!!\" factor. For everything I tried there, I thought to myself how it tasted better at Midwood Smokehouse, just a mere 2 miles up the road.  Will I go back? I'm not hurrying to go, but I'm sure I will find myself there again for whatever reason. They did seem to have a very good beer selection, although I wasn't drinking this particular evening. To win me over, however, they are really going to need to step their game up with their food, and then I will gladly re-review.",

And what is a bbq place if i dont get ribs. The ribs were good but it wasnt like i never ate ribs like this before.   The atmosphere was nice they had a lot of TVs there.  The one thing i would suggests is that to get the sweet tea! Now that was really great!

The baked beans were too sweet for our taste, good southern style I suppose. I opted for the burger which stated on menu \"cooked to order\".. I was not asked nor did I say how I wanted it cooked and it came out well done. The bun was HUGGGGE compared to the size of the burger... 75% bun 25% burger.. would have worked if there were a bunch of toppings, but not for a cheeseburger with 2 pieces of bacon... the bacon was super good thou. The burger was dry from being cooked to well done and was disappointing, I wouldn't order it again. Ordered it with the mac'n'cheese which was super good.. creamy, good cheese crust on the top. The next day had a few bites of cold pork and the mac and they were just as good, if not better, than the day before. Next round I will stick to the BBQ.",

I read the reviews and although some were unflattering, my wife and I decided to try it for ourselves.  Were we glad we didn't pay much attention to the reviews. We went there in the afternoon to see if we wanted to comeback for dinner. What we found were very friendly staff and a nicely laid out restaurant which the great smell of BBQ.  So later in the day, we went for dinner and brought a friend. We got right in at about 6:30 on Friday. They were busy, but had a few tables open. The service was very good and friendly.  Now the food. The ribs were delicious! They were smokey but also finished on the grill with a nice crispy finish. Just the way I like them. They didn't fall off the bone which is a no-no in the world of BBQ.  We also had the wings, brisket and sausage. All had a great smokey flavor and the 4 different sauces complimented the meat instead of over powering it. The sides were good as well. The meat was tender and very tasty.  I told my wife if I would have eaten there earlier in the week, I would have been back several times during the week. I'll be back in Charlotte next year and the Queen Q will be a must stop place!",

Everything else was just kinda bland. The menu has many choices, but nothing was really that great.  This place feels corporate, without unique flare.  BBQ restaurants need to be a little \"dirty\" and not so put together.    The beer and bourbon selection was nice.    The bartenders were very nice and attentive, even with a large crowd.  I do not recommend eating here.",

The bar seats about a dozen, and there are several TVs around the perimeter for easy game/event viewing.  I had the classic pulled pork sandwich--the tender pork being so plentiful I had to ditch the bun (good, I'm sure) in favor of a fork and knife. Your choice of sauce awaits on the table. Luckily, I had just enough room after the main event for a side of their \"best\" mac and cheese and light, crispy coleslaw. The beer list was solid and offered a nice spread of N.C. brews. Our server was friendly and efficient.  For me this was a quick walk from Time Warner Cable Arena (right off the light rail line, too) and an inviting post-game-chow option. It's a nice casual dining addition to the Uptown area.",

    "text": "In town for one night and decided to try this because I wanted BBQ and the reviews were good. I assumed the \"Best in the city\" claim wasn't accurate, but I now have to assume it isn't even close. I walked in at at about 7pm in a Saturday night and the place was mostly empty. I should have left right then, but I stuck with it.  First the food, it was ok. I had a platter so I could try a few things. The pulled pork was fine, nothing great, but fine. The ribs were pretty good, a little tough, but no problem. The brisket was just awful, easily the worst I have ever had. It was dry and tough and I'm not entirely sure it had been smoked at all. Absolutely avoid it. The mac and cheese was good, the onion rings nothing special.  Next the beer. They had a pretty good beer selection. I had a local IPA, I-77 I believe it was called, and it was quite good. But, the beer wasn't near enough to fix the real problem.  Shortly after I ordered, a young woman got on a mic and announced that she was sorry to interrupt the football game, but she was going to sing some songs. What the hell? What kind of BBQ place has someone come in with an acoustic guitar and play a set? She might have been fine in some hole in the wall bar, but not in a BBQ restaurant. It was awful. She played at least 10 songs, and played loudly enough that you could not ignore her. I have no idea why they thought it was a good idea, but if that is a typical Saturday night, it is no wonder that the place is empty.",

The waitress was very nice and the food was excellent! I am a very picky eater and I enjoyed every single bite.  The potato salad was yummy (even though I dislike onions). The brisket sandwich was delicious. I drank water but my husband tried the brewed beer which he enjoyed. The music was 70's Rock and the train really wasn't as annoying as the guy behind us that was smoking and the smoke coming right at me every few minutes. The people beside us brought their little dog and we thought that was nice. Very casual atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place!",

There was some confusion with our beer order -- BF ordered an IPA and very clearly received a brown ale -- and one of the waiters was a little argumentative when we pointed it out.   Food was a little hit and miss. The nachos were great! (Although an upcharge on $14 nachos to get about 1/4 cup of guacamole is a rip off.) Apricot chipotle wings were average -- the sauce was way too sweet with no spice. And, last (and coincidently least) was the tuna taco. I know, I know. Why'd I order a tuna taco at a BBQ restaurant? I was asking myself the same question after tasting it... The taco was cold and flavorless.   We'll likely be back -- you can't beat their offer to validate parking in the uptown 7th Street Garage just for stopping in for a beer or some food -- but will be wary of the tacos.",

We started with one waiter who took our drink order (of water), waited about 10 minutes, then had some other waitress come over to take our drink order. We then had the hostess come over to take our order. She didn't know the difference between the two Cole slaws on the menu and continued to tell us it was her 2nd day. I ordered a cup of the chili, but received a bowl of \"chili mac\" when our food was served.   As much as I would have loved to eat that, I can't due to celiac disease. I proceeded to tell the hostess (who delivered our food) that I had ordered the chili, to which she looked completely perplexed.  She walked away and then came back to ask if I had ordered a cup or a bowl. It was a brisket chili..... without brisket. I asked for the check immediately, knowing it would take a while to get and of course we were charged for a bowl of the \"chili mac\" instead of a cup of chili.   My bf ordered the \"pick two\" with ribs and brisket, Cole slaw and sweet potato fries. He said the brisket and Cole slaw was good, but the ribs were less than average.   I've never left a restaurant hungry and irritated before. I hope I never have to again.",

The BBQ itself is a mixed bag, it's kind of doing what Midwood does by having something for everyone and not really staying True to Carolina BBQ tradition. The pork and chicken is OK, the ribs are very good as is surprisingly the brisket. The greens here are very good. Service was spotty on our visit, borderline inattentive and did not bring our beverage order but the bar staff resolved it directly when I approached them and it appears to be an issue with a particular server.

She took our drink orders and gave everyone ample time to review the menu and returned to take our order.  Being a large group it seemed like we have a variety of items, pulled pork platter, pork sandwich, sliders, nachos, quesadillas, etc. and everyone enjoyed their meals.  Overall I heard some complaints about the fries, not being cooked, and the nachos lacked meat.  They were a pile of nachos.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pork was okay, not my favorite and my fries were raw...which was very disappointing because I love me some good fries.  As for the cole slaw I would pass on that, pretty dry.

I opted against the sampler plate and went for a full order of the ribs.  Definitely the way to go.  I really love the vinegar-based BBQ sauces in North Carolina.  Prices are a bit upscale, but the overall atmosphere is worth it.  I can understand the complaints on service, while not the case for me, I had to advocate for some other patrons getting ignored.  Would definitely go back when in town, and think y'all are lucky to have another BBQ option in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I've worked uptown for years and finally made it here for lunch with a friend last Friday. As a BBQ fiend, I was excited to check it out. Upon entering, I immediately loved the atmosphere - two separate bars on either side and all kinds of tables in the back with an overwhelming (in a good way) smell of barbecue. Mmmmm....  We were promptly seated, even though it was just after noon and the NCAA games were on. Our waitress was prompt and friendly in the beginning, but we had to flag her down after our food came just to get more water. Eh.  Onto the food! I figured I'd start with the basics on my first trip and went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($9) which came with slaw (I ditched that) and a side, so I got the first one on the list - mac & cheese.  It arrived pretty quickly, and the first thing I noticed was that the bun was HUGE. I grabbed some sauce off the table - they give you 6 options - and went to town. Without much (any?) sauce on the sandwich and with way too much bun, the sandwich itself was kinda dry. It was also so unwieldy that dipping it in sauce wasn't possible, so I just kept putting sauce on the sandwich after each bite... I know, classy. The mac & cheese was pretty darn tasty and creamy.  Overall, the atmosphere was great, the service was a little iffy, and the sammich was tasty, but Mac's and Midwood still have it beat - however, a solid option for BBQ if you're uptown.",

The waiter suggested mac and cheese and baked beans for sides. The beans were really good and the mac and cheese was pretty good too. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and did a great job.   While not everything knocked it out of the park, the service, ribs, and brisket took this trip to a 5. I don't want to suggest the other stuff was bad by any means, though. I couldn't justify giving great service and terrific brisket with really good ribs anything less.",

I figured I'd have a seat at the bar like I always do when trying out a new place.  It looks like they have two bars here...one to the left of the door and one to the right.  I chose the one to the right.   I was  presented with the draft beer menu and they have a great selection of craft beers including many local beers.  They even have a chalkboard on the wall to support the local beers but sadly, I was disappointed when Triple C was not on that list.  They also have a very extensive bottled craft beer selection.    They have quite a few options with the menu but I was here for the 'cue...just regular pulled pork.  That's what I ordered with sides of green bean casserole and slaw.  It wasn't even 10 minutes  from my order time that my food arived.  The plate was full.  The barbecue was flavorful and could easily stand on its own.  But there were 4 sauces to choose from to add additional flavor.  None of them really stood out to me but that's ok since the 'cue was amazing.  For the sides, the grean bean casserole was tasty but the slaw was about average.  Service-wise, it was great when I first got there but I ended up waiting for a 2nd beer and again for my check.  Also the bar is cramped.  Chairs or lined up right on top of each other.  Overall a good experience.  But please, get some Triple C beers in there!!!!",

    "text": "Queen City Q was just what we needed after a long day of traveling. The beer selection is large with lots of NC brews. The pulled pork plate was huge and cooked to perfection. The collard greens were especially tasty and just salty enough from the bacon they were cooked with. They have a bunch of great barbecue sauces here--one from every major barbecue region. Use the eastern NC sauce with some cholula hot sauce. They have a ton of TVs and a few big projectors which makes it a perfect place for watching NCAA tournament games. The service is fast and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. Even though it's a huge restaurant the quality of food and personality of the staff made it feel like a small hometown barbecue joint to which I will definitely return.",

The meat is piled high and topped with a lightly dressed cider cilantro slaw.    While we noshed, Chef Dan \"Boone\" Gibson chatted with us about the evolution of the restaurant.  Boone's laid back, down-to-earth demeanor transfixed us all-it felt like we were sitting on his back porch drinking sweet tea as we chatted about his mom's baked beans and his aunt Nell's mac and cheese.  I'm a big fan of sonya's salad with shrimp.  I'm not a big fan of the service, which is consistently lacking.",

    "text": "My 6 & 9 year old nephews would argue the reason to come to Queen City Q is because of the Mac n' Cheese. They aren't wrong, what is often an after thought at other barbecue restaurants is art here. The macaroni is never watery, the cheese is consistent thru the dish & there's just a touch of crust on top.  You may think I'm ignoring the meat of the issue. Pardon the pun. The Q slow smokes the meat that you will smell driving up 7th St parking deck (yes they validate). Rather than start a religious war amongst the regional styles The Q serves the hand pulled pork naked and provides, eastern, western, South Carolina mustard and their own house sauces. Pork isn't the only option here there's brisket, ribs, chicken & local sausages. If you're real hungry pick 3 or4 for a platter. You can bring your vegetarian friends to choose from the variety of sides. If you're in a different mood get the flying tuna tacos with Asian slaw. There's plenty of craft beer to wash down your choice.  Inside you'll find the place is rustic upscale combining local barn beams as accents to a casual seating area reflective of the uptown location.",

There are two bars, one is just dedicated to local brews, but you can sit at either and order stuff (the bartender may have to make a quick run to the other bar).  The Q has a decent offering of bar food and BBQ so you can definitely find something on the menu that will wet your whistle and curb your appetites.  Plenty of TVs around to catch a game there if needed.  I was sorely disappointed how many UNC fans I found there one night during an NC State v. UNC bball game.  I was severely outnumbered, but I am glad my wolfpack pulled out the win and broke the losing streak curse!  Everyone is super friendly and nice here, including the bartender who made sure that we got our $$'s worth out of the shots we ordered (wondered why it was taking so long) but the bottle was out and the guy didn't want to give us some (half ___(insert wording here)'ed shots) so that was why we waited a bit.

So naturally, I had to check it out.  This is not real barbeque....I would never pay $15 for real barbeque either. I should have ran when I saw queso on the menu.  If you're in town on business and you're from the midwest, this place might be fantastic! But if you're used to smoking a pig in your backyard and dousing it in vinegar or going to a mom and pop shop that hasn't been updated since the '70's you won't like it.  I only had the barbeque here once and it was severely under-seasoned. The service wasn't extraordinary either.   It's mediocre, that's all I can say.  With that being said, BBQ King off Wilkinson is said to be some of the best 'que in the Queen City. And honestly, I prefer Cookout's bbq over Queen City Que's.   If you're uptown and looking for barbeque, don't. Unfortunately this is not where they serve the good stuff.",

They serve cheer-wine too which is always a great option here in charlotte.   As for the food it was nothing to write home about. I got their chili burger with fries, and hush puppies.

It was also a little difficult to get her attention when we needed her and that was a little annoying when ordering drinks. But we did go on a busy night so it was understandable.   The food was pretty good. The sweet potato fries were great!! The basket was a good portion for sure! We got the pulled pork dinner with 2 sides and it was enough to feed 2 people! The mac n cheese and hush puppies are wonderful! Now for the BBQ.. I personally was not amazed by it. I am not a fan of vinegar based BBQ sauce and that is the only kind they had. It was a little disappointing. I heard nothing but good things and the BBQ just fell short for me. A few people at our table got the jumbo wings (they were reg. sized wings) and the flavor was great! They are prepared with a rub and not wet and it was great! Overall the average price for just a dinner with no apps would be between $11-$15 and if you like vinegar based BBQ you will like this spot.",

    "text": "I went to Charlotte for the weekend, and went here for lunch with some friends of mine yesterday. I really enjoyed the food here! Queen City Q is located right across from the Time Warner Arena stadium; it has an inside and outside area to eat at. We chose to eat outside since it was a beautiful day, plus you can get a good view of downtown Charlotte!  Our waitress was really nice and prompt. Service was on point for sure! I got the Q's platter which was three meats, two sides, and Texas toast. I got pulled pork barbecue, brisket, and ribs for my meats; fried okra and Mac and cheese for my sides and of course toast to go with it. Everything was delicious! The meats were cooked perfectly and the sauce there was to die for! It was very sweet and tangy. Their Mac and cheese was also some of the best I have had in awhile. Cut made me think of the max and cheese these old ladies used to make at my church when we had a pot luck or something!   All in all the experience here was great, and the next time I come to Charlotte I will make sure to be back!",

However, I will say that the proximity to the light rail caused a bit of a nuisance as the train would pass.  Our table of seven started off with a dozen deviled eggs which turned out to be the perfect amount. I then ordered the Texas Brisket entree with mac & cheese and collard greens as sides. To drink I ordered Larken's Patio Punch which I found to be a bit sweeter (and pinker) than I had envisioned.  In general, I would say everything was remarkably unremarkable. Nothing was bad, but nothing left a lasting impression either. I had barbecue out of town last weekend, and Queen City Q was a notch below in my opinion. I probably won't go out of my way to come back.",

The okra was cold. The only thing that was good was the salad and homemade chips. I'm a Texas native. Good brisket need no sauce and is tender. The sauce is just extra flavor. When you have to use sauce and it's still tough and dry there's an issue with cooking and quality. I'll pass on Queen.",

I know it's not too typical to order chicken tenders at a BBQ restaurant but the heart wants what the heart wants! With the chicken I was able to taste the different bbq sauces that were available on the tables and was a bit underwhelmed. Maybe I didn't shake them as much as I should but they were runny and honestly all tasted the same. I also had the hush puppies which  didn't do much for me, I felt they could use a bit more seasoning especially within the batter.",

Goes well on its own but if you need sauce, the simple vinegar and red pepper is the way to go.  Smoked chicken came with mustard sauce and was fantastic. Again not overly smoked and was juiced and very tasty. Could do with a bit more as was that good.  Pork ribs had great texture but were pre sauced with a sweet tomato based sauce which was a bit incongruous relative to the vinegar and mustard varieties.  Overall this place surpassed expectations given it's a city center joint. Worth a visit.",

Food was better than the last BBQ place I had gone to, but hey I'm from Texas I know what real BBQ taste like. The brisket was good, everything else was meh. Mac and cheese was not great, fried pickle was good.   Service was horrible, i didn't get to put in my drink order, she left to get the first order of drink rather than waiting for 3 people to put in a request. When we were done eating our food we were waiting to get our server attention to get a to go box. But what was funny how we asked a server who wasn't our server,didn't want to get it for us.  He pointed where our server was, who happen to see she should attend our services. Not only that but our server was so stupid that when we asked for the check she said can I get you another beer. Had you checked on us earlier maybe, but not when we asked for the check. Duh, common sense.  Servers eat in front of the customers, they mingle and drink in front of our faces and you see the hostess flirting with the bar backs. Had I known this was a mingle for people who hated their jobs and wanted to hang out, I would have gotten my food to go and and not see a social place where people just want to sleep with each other after work.   P.s we were the only table they were serving!",

    "text": "I love the Q.  I think I've been there a couple dozen times.  There are so many great things about it.  First of all, the beer selection.  It's definitely one of the top 3 beer spots in downtown Charlotte.  If you want a local beer, there's no better place to try them ALL. And they keep their beer menu up-to-date which is important with such a rotating list of seasonals.  The food is fantastic.  It's not the cheapest BBQ places around, but it's definitely the best downtown.  Heck, I'm a vegetarian (well, pescatarian...) and always find plenty to eat on the menu.  A great selection of salads, the fried pickles are super tasty, and they have some outstanding fish entrees, such as tuna tacos and a tuna \"burger.\"  I visit frequently before and after arena events, especially when the Charlotte Checkers are playing!  There is only one reason I'm giving the Q only four stars, and it's simple:  Thursday nights.  You see, they have trivia there.  And while usually I'm a fan of trivia, it's absolutely, positively, the loudest thing ever.  I don't know why the guy running it believes that you need to have giant speakers and boost them at 98 dB, but he does (yes, I used a decibel meter to see how loud it was, that's loud!).  It's painfully loud, and there's nowhere in the place to go to avoid the noise.  Blaring music, yelling into the mic.  It's just unpleasant.  I've walked in there twice on Thursday evenings and turned around and left because I couldn't handle how loud it was.  So, as long as you don't go on a Thursday evening you are sure to have a great meal, an awesome beverage, and a great time at the Q!",

Not the common tale for a lunch crowd, so I was intrigued to try me some BBQ.   The space is rather large. Tons of tables in the main dining area, two separate bars with ample seating and even a private dining area with space for about 25-30.   The service was very snappy. Quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Our server seemed to be able to carry 3 pitchers at a time and still pour sweet tea into our glasses! They've definitely hired some seasoned employees.   I ordered the open faced brisket sandwich. A gratuitous portion of brisket on texas toast. Very simple, which I appreciate, and no frills to try and mask the flavor of the meat. Just some grilled onions on top for good measure. The brisket was tender and smoky. It's impressive to me that a place in Uptown is actually smoking their meats. Not an easy feat and only attempted and successfully executed by a handful of joints in town. My hat's off to QCQ for this one. Served open-faced, but easily picked up and smashed into your face for the more adventurous.   The beans were ok. Nothing special. I did appreciate the inclusion of Neese's sausage. Standard for some bacon or a few bits of pork fat in beans, but sausage? That's a high-five all around.   Great job, QCQ! I'll be back!",

    "text": "Queen City Q certainly knows how to cook up an animal but I think it says more that our vegetarian friend loved it too.  Sure, the pulled pork is delicious.(I like to coat it in both the PoPo and Q Pork sauces for maximum flavor.) So are the sausage and the chicken. The ribs are tasty, though they often have broken bones. The brisket...usually too fatty for me but the parts that are meat are alright.  If it's your first time out I highly suggest getting a Q platter to split with someone(s) so you can try many meats. But the sides. Oh, the sides.  GET THE BAKED BEANS!  That deserved its own paragraph. They have sausage so they aren't veggie, but they are amazing and I want to bathe in them. The green bean casserole is great and has a little kick. I'm not a huge baked mac and cheese fan but I always seem to steal some off someone else s plate. I have it on good authority that the hush puppies are also a winner. Beer is a side too, right? Because they have lots of it and the tap list is always dotted with local choices, often of the harder to find variety. All in all, the Q Is a great place to go if you have a hankerin' for a meal that will stick to your ribs and put a smile on your sauce-covered face.  Also, they validate parking in the garage next door, so fear not about uptown parking, even on Bobcats game days.",

I dropped by one night and the place was dead, so I tried last night (Friday) and was pleasantly surprised to find the place filled with all kinds of folks.  I decided to sit at the bar and order a BBQ plate...............wow, was I surprised.  The bartender, as nice as she was, wasn't the best one I've ever had....good intentions, but slow on delivery mainly because she was both serving customers and getting drinks for the dining room.  Decor wise the place had been repainted, but other than a few items on the wall and some old wood covering up some parts of the room, not much different than previous tenants.  When dinner arrived, it was a H U G E amount of pork!!!!!!!!!  Not the mention the 2 sides added to a mound of food I could not even attempt to finish.   But it was good!  Very good.  All of it.  So I ate what I could (this plate is big enough for 2 people) and took the rest home.  FYI:  Like Brixx next door, they'll pay for your parking upstairs (a plus)",

They had a ton of beers on tap including Birdsong and NoDa brewing.    After scanning the list of bottled beers, I saw a Woodchuck. Score! But when telling the waitress that I was going to order that she asked about the bottle...kind of like nobody ordered that. I asked her if they had any ciders on tap, and she said they had Crispin. I love cider on tap, so of course I switched. (FYI they didn't have that on their menu, so I'm glad I asked.)   We hung out for a while at the bar, which was pretty relaxed, got our parking validated and then left. Our bartender was pretty good, I think she knew why we were there (parking for Free!).

They validate if you park in the garage directly above them, but the sign on the sidewalk was  hard to read and we parked in the garage directly across from their sign instead.  No big deal, we learned.  It was a small price to pay for a delicious BBQ dinner.  I had the Texas brisket, which was very tender and tasty.  Topped off with some banana pudding, it was a meal I definitely enjoyed.",

    "text": "Mmmhmm. Sit me in a comfortable but modern atmosphere, and give me a toasty plate of pulled pork barbecue with two delicious sides and I am one happy camper.   Queen City Q is certainly making its way into my top choices for barbecue in Charlotte. And that is no easy task!   Allow me to break it down for you...  The space: It's quite expansive with lofty ceilings, a large bar, and plenty of high tops and booths. And, they validate parking in the adjacent lot, so no worries about paying an arm and a leg to get your Q!   The service: Quick, efficient and friendly on all accounts.  The barbecue: Succulent, tender pulled pork in a delicious sauce. Plus, there are four sauces on the table, so whichever region of 'cue you long for, you can make happen.   The sides: I selected the mac 'n cheese and edamame and corn salad. Both were equally tasty...especially the corn salad. Hey - I needed something healthy-esque on the plate!   The price: Super affordable and fair. Considering that Uptown offers a dichotomy of restaurants, upper crust or quick sandwiches, Queen City Q is a nice respite in regards to both price and environment.   Viva la Q!",

The portion sizes are large, with prices lower than most of the restaurants in the area.  _______________update__________ I've been back several times over the past few months, and am extremely happy with the service now. There's attention on the tables and guests making the experience enjoyable again.   _______________old and now outdated________ I give it 2 stars based on the service.  I've seen several changes in management, and have talked to some of the servers about this.  The owner seems to be present more often but overall service doesn't happen by the servers.  Every time i've gone, the only person to check in on our table have been food runners/kitchen employees.  I have yet to have a server refill a drink without being asked (and on occasion more than once).  I have had issues with my bill the last 2 times, which was corrected, but why did the server not notice the incorrect prices?    I haven't been in several months now, and waiting to see some reviews of improved attention to service.",

With that said, I honestly feel as though the vibe of the place is just negative. The managers seem to treat their employees like slaves almost. This young man was on the floor cleaning a spill and the owner with white hair just walked all over him completely oblivious to his employee cleaning a spill in HIS restaurant. All he did was go to the bar and talk with his \"big shot\" buddies. Im only going to mention this but there were another two incidents where I feel like the managers were being disrespectful to their employees. It's disgusting. If I saw this on my second time dining here then I am sure folks see this all the time. I dont support restaurants that treat their employees with disrespect this was my second and last time dining at the Queen City Q.",

We had to get their attention and we were the only ones waiting. Our waiter was rushed and rude and there were very few people in the restaurant.

My issues with the place are the bright lights and sometimes care-free attitude of the staff.  We rarely received a smile and never was asked if we would like another beer while we were eating, even with empty glasses in front of us.  I'm all about 20% tips when the service is great, but some of the staff needs to step up their game if gratuity is important to them. Also, let's dim the lights a little, it wasn't cleaning time or last call. Ambulance, service and good food all go hand-in-hand, even for a sports bar.",

The atmosphere is traditional southern with a fun, modern Uptown twist; you always feel comfortable and welcome. The management and owners are always friendly and quick to welcome patrons and guests.   So, the food, right? Amazing. I'm not from the south; I grew up on brats, steaks, and fish boils as a token staple... However, I cannot mistake good food and the Q has it. I suggest the mac and cheese (duh) and the brisket. The meat is slow smoked to perfection and is extremely tasty and tender.  So, when is the opportune time to head to the Q? Well, anytime but specifically as a precurser to your Uptown escapades, to catch some sports action, to play Thursday night trivia, to pre-game before your favorite event at Time Warner Cable Arena, or to enjoy a comfort food packed evening.",

    "text": "Decent barbeque located uptown. I think since moving to the Carolinas, I've become quite picky when it comes to barbeque. After a fun night at Discovery Place, we decided to try Queen City Q.  Customer service was okay, but we did have to keep asking other servers for refills. I felt like when her server did stop, she was constantly in a hurry or also running a drink to another customer.   The food was good,  but not the best I've had. I was pretty hungry. We ordered the hushpuppies and pork egg rolls as an appetizer.  The hushpuppies were good and came with a honey butter. They were greasier than others I've had which kind of turned me off. The egg rolls were better.  They had a nice smoky taste, but I wish they came with more sauce. For my main course, I had the smoked chicken with collard greens and Mac and cheese. The chicken was tender and was smoky. I also appreciated they cook it with the mustard sauce, which is my favorite sauce. The greens were probably my most favorite part of the meal. They tasted like they had been cooked all day with a ham hock and were full with flavor, with just the right amount of vinegar. Mac and cheese was good.   Average barbeque joint with average service. It is probably the best barbeque uptown since there's only one other one I can think of.",

The service typically goes very slow-- although there are times when you snag a good one. Tonight they magically started charging for their dipping sauces. Fifty cents per half filled 2.0 OZ cups-- that won't ever happen again. Our family of six had a 20% gratuity added to the bill...why? So bizarre-- and we'd never get away with this in our hospitality based business. If you're craving bbq--give it a try and you be the judge. Today was the last time I plan to be apart of the shenanigans.",

NC bbq is unique and this place rocks it!  The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and you get to choose a side from their huge list of options.  I ordered the collard greens which were so good I could have eaten only the greens and been happy.  Our group also ordered Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries and loved all of it.  They also offer several vinegar sauces on the table which are fun to try. The service was great. The location was awesome.",

Here is why: This most awful place I have been to during my 2 Months + in Charlotte. Walked in across the street from work and entered the restaurant- no hi, eye contact or any acknowledgments from either the lady at the kiosk or even the manager who was nearby. I was told it'll be 15 minutes. I got my buzzer and waited. After about 25 minutes I see people that came long after me were being seated. I asked the Kiosk person and she said \"because they were more than one person but you are one!\" Really! So how long more - she answered \"don't know\". As I was trying to understand their logic the manager walked by.. So I asked him and he said the same thing. So I am being penalized because I am just one customer ? I asked. He said yes, that is how it works, Really!   I returned my buzzer to the manager and left the restaurant after about 30 minutes. I told him that you his was not good customer practice and That i would hesitate to go there - He said fine!, REALLY!  Listen, I care about the food where I eat but more than anything else I value the customer service. This place has NONE!",

Weird ambience there...they literally were playing \"cops\" on the tv (with an investigation on drugs or something). So weird. I kept looking around like, why is this on?   I'm giving 2 stars and this is solely because they have a good amount of beers, and a full bar. Drinks specials too! So that's how they are getting two stars on me. If you want good bbq...go to midwoods. Still hands down the best bbq in Charlotte! I've tried everywhere",

Believe me you won't be able to eat the entire serving. It comes with pulled pork on it. Which is smoked to perfection. There's always enough sauce/condiments to go with the chips. The chips are always fresh. Also had a serving of 8 deviled eggs. These are the best in town...hands down. The egg white to filling ratio is just right. The filling is seasoned well... not bland like other places. I've also had the brisket in times past. It's a nice, tender, smokey piece of meat. Queen City Q is in a perfect location just one block over from the Spectrum Center Arena when you can catch a meal either before or after a game or concert. If you park in the deck right beside the restaurant, take your parking ticket in and they will validate it for free!",

And always brought family and friends because of the wings. Today I had a horrible experience and literally never have had a bad one. There was no host or bartender when I arrived. When I finally spoke to someone she referred me back to the hostess we'll cool but I want a beer while I wait, extra money and a tip for you, nah. She wasn't friendly acted like she was completely bothered. I get to the host stand she completely ignores me I'm first and she turns to the couple and tries to seat them. The manager who i didn't know was the manager at the time was not friendly either I tried to have small talk she barely cracked a smile or entertained me in my opinion just RUDE. Her name I believe was leisl Conley. Whoever took my order over the phone didn't mention they don't do all flats okay that's fine just tell me that don't let me be surprised when I check my bag. And if it's an extra charge whatever. Anyway my experience was horrible I still left a tip for the host which I shouldn't and nothing but .50 for the bartender who never checked on me and took forever to come out. What a horrible experience makes me want to never return no matter how good the wings are they made me feel like shit and that's not worth a penny.",

Additionally, they boil their brisket (ugh), sear it, then slop sauce on it... Totally gross. I would have thought that they'd have improved their brisket with the new menu... NOPE!  I get that chicken prices have increased but to reduce the customer wing experience by 50% (not accounting their reduced size, too) is ridiculous...

So I guess the first time really wasn't that memorable. Anyway after we were seated that's when I realized how familiar the place looked. I remember I had the brisket a few years ago and I want impressed. So this time I got the pulled pork and I'm glad I did. I also loved tasting the vinegar based Carolina style BBQ sauces. I'm from NY so the BBQ sauce in most familiar with is the kind in the bottle from the grocery store like Kraft and this was a nice change of flavor profile. The rib sauce and queen sauce were my favorites. I drenched my pulled pork with the sauce. It's quite addicting. I also tried the cup of chili which is made with brisket and comes with tortilla chips. It's topped with melted cheese, green peppers, red onions and sour cream. Now this is a great way to make mediocre brisket and make it great. The chili was full of flavor and delicious. We also ordered a dozen wings. Half apricot Chipotle and half Carolina mustard both were nice and juicy. I wouldn't have minded more sauce on the wings though. Also it's a bit expensive for a dozen wings at $12. They weren't particularly large either. Our server was very nice and attentive. The decor included a lot of wooden surfaces. Kind of like a modern saloon.",

It offers one unique aspect in that it is located in the middle of uptown rather than out in the 'burbs like most of them.  Country cooking, urban setting.   We came in on Sunday for lunch and found the place to be pretty empty, which was a little surprising since we got there just after 12.  There were some good drink specials going on including $5 bloody marys and some $2 local craft beers.  There was a brunch menu but nothing on that menu looked all that interesting so we opted for the classic pulled pork.  The menu had all kinds of good looking sides to go along with it.  I'm talking collard greens, onion rings, sweet potato fries, bbq slaw, hush puppies, baked beans, etc etc etc...   There were several different varieties of sauce on the table to suit different tastes.  The Eastern style is always my favorite and theirs was pretty tasty.  Once it was all said and done, we had the really good down-home meal that we were hoping to get when we walked in.  We will definitely be back to this place and I highly recommend it if you're in town looking for good barbecue.",

BBQ sandwich comes with slaw on it but they will put it on the side if you request it. There are 3 or 4 different bottles/styles of sauce that you can saturate your BBQ sandwich with. I chose the Queeen City specialty sauce. You also have the choice of a mustard base sauce and Eastern Carolina style. Once I got waited on the meal arrived quickly and the service was excellent.

I keep stopping by simply for convenience.  I had high hopes today as I went with a group, some first timers and no one was impressed with the food or service.  Most of us got the pulled pork which was pretty dry and bland and i've come to expect that here but the lack of service today is going to probably keep me from coming back.  Once our drinks and food were brought out there was no other sighting of the waiter until our checks were dropped off, no refills on the drinks, no asking if anything was needed, etc.",

    "text": "First off, I have to say this with a fair warning...this is based on an experience I had with their food truck at the Rural Hill Food Truck Rally. I have not been to their physical location, but after sampling the food from their truck, I don't think I want to make the effort to go there. You can argue that the product is different because it's served from a truck rather than their restaurant, but that's no excuse for the cruddy product I received from them.  I waited on line for about twenty minutes at their food truck before getting to order. I wanted to try a variety of stuff so I got a pulled pork slider ($3) and a turkey wrap ($5.) The pork was extremely disappointing, though the quantity of the food was worth the price. The slider was a tiny bun filled with pulled pork and a pickle...no slaw, which was sad. Yeah I know it's a small slider but they could have put a tiny scoop of slaw on it! The meat itself had no smokeyness to it at all, and the meat was tough and dry. Definitely not what I expect from BBQ down here in North Carolina.  The turkey wrap was a huge disgrace. Now I didn't bother asking what was in it, so I can only blame myself for having to eat what was given to me. Their turkey wrap was not smoked turkey, which is what I would assume from a BBQ joint. This thing was a wrap filled with turkey salad...a very mayo-y turkey salad. The mayo overpowered this wrap and made the overall product very runny. I definitely didn't taste any turkey, as the heavy mayo stood out most of all.   Based on some dry and flavorless pulled pork and an over-mayo'd turkey salad wrap, I have no intention of going out of my way to visit Queen City Q's brick and mortar location. You can blame it on it being a food truck, and that they were out of their element, but if that's the case they shouldn't be selling their wares from a truck if that causes it to be substandard. Maybe in the distant future, if the situation arose, I would be willing to give them a second chance, but that is a big maybe.",

It had a good smoky flavor with the right amount of bark which I love.  The flavor of the BBQ was tasty and didn't need any sauce except for it being a little dry. The collard greens tasted good but were overcooked and soggy. I came in for a late lunch so maybe it was it sitting longer. The coleslaw was pretty bad to where I could barely eat a bite. I know coleslaw can vary a lot, but it's rare for me to not be able to eat it.  It was very heavily soaked in a sweet apple vinegar. Even when I tried to drain the vinegar with my fork the vinegar flavor was so overwhelming I couldn't eat it. I would come back and give these guys another chance, but it's not on my favorite BBQ list either.",

Sometimes it's nice to take a stroll though and revisit old friends.  With a name like Queen City Q, you better be packin' some big guns. It's as if you're aiming to not just create great BBQ, but almost emphatically looking to represent the city. While that seems like a great strategy, it has great potential to also backfire.   Most locals know BBQ. And most locals have their favorites. There is already a benchmark and any new Q joints are always scrutinized. While the opinion of the best is subject to debate,  I'd say it's safe to say Queen City Q can hold their own.",

I didn't have time to really give the place a look-over, but as a to-go service, I was impressed. The orders we all together at the front and very organized and labeled.

    "text": "I can't imagine what it would take to ever drag me in this dump again.   Hostess up front is clueless. She was almost trying to convince people not to wait. (I wish I had made that decision, in retrospect) After finally giving my name and getting a pager, I just watched her botch interaction after interaction with each new customer as they arrived. The ones that left were the lucky and smart ones. Then instead of busing off, or having someone bus, the now vacant 2 and 4 tops, she bused off an 8 top and sat a party of 7 that arrived well after us.   We got smoked wings and deviled eggs as appetizers. The eggs were bland, and the wings, supposedly finished on a grill, had zero char on them.   I got a combo of three meats. Only the ribs were passable. The smoked sausage tasted like a Hillshire Farms kielbasa, if the kielbasa was shoved up someone's ass and left to die for a few days. Inside was complete mush. The brisket was dry, with no trace of a smoke ring.  The picture of the sandwich attached was the \"brisket\" sandwich my daughter got. They should be embarrassed to let anything leave the kitchen that looks as grey, dried out and dead as that meat looked. The waitress comped the sandwich off the check, at least, and was the one person in the restaurant that actually knew what she was doing.   If this is indicative of the dining experience Queen City Q offers, then it's no wonder their outpost at Concord Mills closed so rapidly! Save your time, save your money, and choose any other of the multitude of restaurants around the neighborhood. Seriously.",

We stopped in earlier this week and saw a sign advertising their Taco Tuesday specials (strange for a barbecue restaurant, I thought, but I was intrigued). The sweet tea was great, perfectly sweetened, but overly priced at $2.95. The hush puppies were great and the honey butter that accompanied them was great as well, however it was odd to me to dip the very oniony-tasting puppies into the sweet butter. There were many options on the menu I wanted to try but ultimately I decided to go for the Taco Tuesday special ($2.50 tacos), getting one chicken taco, one bbq taco, and a side of macaroni. The tacos were great, with slaw and a lime wedge on the side. The macaroni was pretty good, but not anything spectacular. Overall, I would say despite some downfalls, the restaurant was great and I would definitely come back - there's still more on the menu I want to try!",

    "text": "Stopped by here a few years ago, when I worked for Merrill Lynch and they sent us to Charlotte for Training.  After talking with a few folks, and getting recommendations for the best food in the area, Queen City Q came up a few times. The firstt time, a group of 8 of us went our for drinks and BBQ, as my firm gave me $60/night to spend on food, I ordered 2 entrees, and still could not max out my allowance. The experience was amazing, as was the food.   When I found out I'd be traveling to Charlotte for a wedding, I told my wife about this place, and the two of us took our 15-month-old toddler, who although made a mess, enjoyed her food. I strongly recommend Queen City Q for lunch, dinner, drinks with friends, a date, or to watch a game.  They have a great selection of beers on tap, the service is friendly and attentive, and the place is clean.  We had trouble finding this place while driving, so my wife called them, and one of their employees stood outside on the phone until we found it. Now, I'm craving BBQ!  The only recommendation I would make is to better differentiate their BBQ sauces, as there is no way to tell the difference.  Adding this to the menu, with a description would be a great help. Also, recommend they add a hot sauce!!!",

The pulled pork and fried okra were delicious but I completely fell in love with the collard greens. Also, the staff was very friendly, the ambiance was nice and casual, and everything was very reasonably priced. They also had a large selection of sauces which I appreciated (all of them were really good). I'd definitely love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone.   They also have a nice craft beer selection!",

    "text": "I like the atmosphere of Queen City Q. When we walked in we were immediately seated. The service as  a whole was great, our server was friendly and attentive and was able to provide recommendations really well. All the food came out really quickly.. We ordered hush puppies as an appetizer and they were tasty along with the honey butter that came with it. By the time we were finishing the hush puppies our food came out. I ordered the Baby Q (2 meat 2 side) platter with Ribs and Brisket and I wanted to also try the pull pork so I ordered a taco for $3.99.   The ribs were ok not my favorite the ribs weren't fall off the bone or anything and were really fatty and didn't see to have like one stream line bone all the way through which made them not enjoyable to eat.. The sauce was really good on the ribs so I was happy about that.. just not what I expected..   The brisket however wasn't too pleasant either has it was hard and tough to chew and also came out semi cold with the platter you only get 2 strips/slices of the brisket I feel like there should be more that comes with it.. I used their Queen City Q sauce on it which made it ok to eat.  The pulled work taco was by far the best thing that I ate today and the portion of pulled pork was a good amount and i used a different sauces for each bite.  My 2 sides were collard greens and baked beans. The collard greens flavor was good just the greens seemed to be super mushy and the baked beans were madd sweet and tasted like the baked beans you make when you make pork and beans and weanie..   Overall 3/5 service was great food was ok because of the taco I'd be inclined to try again..   *** Suggestion if you wanna try multiple meats I'd say get multiple tacos there $3.99 a piece so you could try the different meats minus the ribs of course. That's what I'd probably do next time around .",

I'd certainly come back but a few other barbecue joints in Charlotte (Sauceman's and Midwood Smokehouse to name a few) are better. We started off with the Pimento cheese dip which was excellent!  It is served chilled and with what seemed liked homemade chips to dip with. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. To me the pork was a bit dry as was the bread it was served on. They were also a bit stingy with the coleslaw they put on top of the sandwich. I've had many a sweet potato fry in my day and these were just OK. I've had better and I've had worse.  On a positive note, the service was top notch. Our server was very attentive, stopping by frequently (but not too frequently!) to either refill drinks or ask if we needed anything.",

I tried them for lunch the other day with a friend and will definitely be back.  I'm a Mac's Speed Shop fan and it's really hard to tell the difference between the two.  That's a good thing, because that means I can now get great BBQ in Uptown. Q's BBQ is very moist and tender, with sauces on the side to add to your taste.  I'm a huge fan of mac 'n cheese, and theirs is excellent.  My only complaint with the food was that my sandwich fell apart after a few bites - the bun just couldn't hold up to the juicy pork and sauces.  I'll have to try a platter the next time.  My friend and I were in a table off to the side, and our server seemed to forget about us.  She never once checked back with us once they delivered our food, and we had to flag her down to get our check.  I only hope service will be better on my next visit!",

Granted, I might be a little biased after being separated from 'que for a while, but I was not disappointed by this place.  We shared the Q Platter with brisket, ribs, and pulled pork, with the Corn maque choux, green bean casserole, and (of course) mac n' cheese as sides.  First off, the platter is a TON of food.  We finished off all our delicious sides, but we had quite a bit of meat left over.  All the meats were great, but my fave was the pulled pork.  CC favored the brisket, but some things never change.  The sides were all great too, but the real stand out was the corn maque choux.  Wow.  That stuff was awesome.  I'll definitely stop by again when I'm back fown in Charlotte.",

I ordered the brisket platter with two sides (baked beans and cole slaw). When the waitress provided the food, I stared completely perplexed at the pieces of meat in front of me. Was it brisket or some mystery meat? Let me say, the \"brisket\" (mystery meat) tasted as bad as it looked. The meat was tough and was served with some sort of sweet tangy sauce on top. Unfortunately, the sides were also bad. A can of Busch's baked beans would have tasted better than the baked beans they offered. Complete waste of money, I took a few bites of everything and was finished.   On top of the poor food, the service is abysmal. I came into the restaurant during the middle of the day and no one acknowledged me as I waited to be seated. The staff were standing around talking. After being seated, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to come to my table and take my drink order. Please note, there were only 7 other patrons in the restaurant.

It didn't have a ton of fat on it but it looked and tasted like it was sitting in grease. The bread was soaked in fat from the meat. We couldn't stop talking about how bad this sandwich was.

We sat on the high tables near the bar and had a view of a handful of TVs with sports games on.  For our appetizers we ordered the Deviled Eggs & Bacon which was very good as well as Southern Fried Pickles of which we were kind of skeptical of eating at first but actually really enjoyed those.  For our entrees I had the Texas Brisket and she had the Slow Smoked Chicken.  I had a piece of Texas toast added to my plate as well as two other sides.  Overall this place had decent food but wasn't amazing.  My girlfriend didn't love her chicken but the rest of the food was good.  I enjoyed my brisket although it was a bit tougher than it should've been for being True barbecue.  We would recommend this place to anyone looking for some barbecue in downtown Charlotte.",

It is in close proximity to Time warner cable stadium which means a short walk for those who are too obese to make the trip. The environment is interestingly a rough, casual bar like setting with much outdoor seating and clean surfaces. The serving staff is nice and did a good job but confusion emerged after they didn't know they were partnered with Charlottes mll team. The food was good but had drawbacks. The BBQ was good, tons of rich southern flavors perfectly paired with a wide range of appetizers. The one issue however was we were stiffed on the dang Coleslaw, I mean who can eat a pile of juicy barbecue without its right hand man? All in all this is a good place to eat but it's a little pricey, so if your willing to spend the green pay a visit to the Queen!",

    "text": "Queen City was recommended to me by a Charlotte local. I tested him by asking him what made it special, the meat or the sauce? He said, the vinegar marinated meat, and sauce is for sausage and chicken! Right then, I knew I could give his recommendation a try. I did, and there was no disappointment! I ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer, they were good w/ a little bacon garnish on top. Entree was the Super Q sampler....(don't be fooled by the last word: sampler) it was a sampler if 4 grown men ordered an entree each and decided to share with the others type of sample. 4 full size servings of your meats of choice! And, 2 side items which I tried the fried okra and Mac n cheese. The sausage was made in house and tasted great w/ the mustard sauce grilled on there. The brisket was great as well! My hat goes off to the ribs, they had a nice caramelized char of the vinegar and rib mop sauce so you didn't need to add any add'l sauce( fall off the bone good), and lastly was the vinegar pulled pork, also no sauce necessary, but feel free to pile it between the Texas toast that comes with the dish! Everything was great and the service was outstanding at the bar (Callie was my waitress/bartender). I paired the meat with the Red Oak Amber Lager, and it was just a bit sweet to punch down the acidity of the vinegar in the meat! If you're near QC, you gotta try it, 4 thumbs up!",

This place has all kinds of barbequed meats, even excluding their acclaimed Carolina style barbeque, (which is a noun).  This was my second time eating here, but the first time I only had a chicken sandwich and mac and cheese (both of which were fresh and delicious).  This time we shared a Queen City sampler which included some killer St. Louis style ribs, a decent piece of barbecued chicken, a good sausage, and some tender brisket.  I also had the mac and cheese again along with some green bean casserole. Our service was mostly good but got a little slower the longer we were there as the place got crowded for a Charlotte Checkers event.  It is a great pre-game spot with plenty of local beers on tap, all of which are $3 on Fridays.  All in all, Queen City Q is a pretty good barbecue place uptown, and it is nice to see a restaurant finally doing well in this location.",

    "text": "More and more I am reminded how awful people have it in the south. The food here was so disappointing, we left after an appetizer and one drink I had to share. Why only one drink? Well, I would have ordered my own, but our waitress never offered or returned. Seriously. Why is service such garbage in the south? Here's how the experience here went... We were searching for a place to eat while visiting Charlotte for the day. Yelp reviews led us here. So we walk in and are greeted swiftly. Place looks clean. Open feel. A few tables were seated in the bar, and in the main dining area, there was only one table. The host puts us at one of those half booths in the corner. First sad moment....not crumbs, but pieces of food all over the booth and bbq sauce smeared all over the table. While I get up to wash my hands, our waitress swung by and took a cocktail order and appetizer order. I didn't see her again until after we were halfway done with the appetizer. Chewing on whatever she had been eating in the back, she comes by to check on us. I'll admit, she's nice enough. But where I come from, you would be fired for ignoring a table for more than two minutes. We had the pimento cheese....I'm told this is a must have in this part of the country. Tasted horrible. Like salty canned cheese mixed with cream cheese. I've been promised that ill get to try the good stuff one of these days cause this wasn't it. The cocktail arrived after our appetizer. My friend who ordered it, couldn't even choke it down. I have 8 years bartender experience under my belt....so I'm familiar with a bad drink. This was a pre mixed long island. My friend who ordered it, physically cannot drink pre mixes due to a medical condition. Neither of us want to touch it. And after waiting another ten minutes for a server....I'm done. So as soon as she's back around I hand her my card and she settles the bill. She INCLUDES the full drink we've been unable to drink in the bill. You just don't do that in customer service.  In conclusion- attentive service was so lacking....I only SAW our server twice. Food was unremarkable. I felt cheated walking out of here. We found another place.",

It's got that slick downtown look but the kitchen is kicking some amazing pulled pork sliders!  They weren't the shredded up, over-sauced bit I've come to associate with pulled pork--these were closer to sliced pork, with a tangy cabbage/greens topping and were simply tasty. At $2, pretty darn big, too. I ruined mine by trying to eat with a knife and fork though; just hoist it up by hand, potential sauce stains be damned. Fries are crispy and well-seasoned too, and look to be hand cut. The owner has a great backstory as well--I was told he went out of his way to hire people who were unemployed. Not transitioning to another job, but who had been looking unsuccessfully for work for months. Well, he sure picked the right ones because the food is great, the staff is friendly and the service is quick. This is going to be a lunchtime staple. And it's right off the seventh street station, so you don't have to futz about parking, but if you do, they validate?? Love!",

I read one review where it said the wings were slow cooked and the meat falls off so I was hoping it would be as good as McKoy's wings on South blvd.  I live down the street so I was hoping for something closer.   I called in for take out and was recommended the jamacian jerk and chipolte apricot flavors.  I brought the order home, opened it and found the majority of the wings were burnt.  Now I'm a guy that usually likes wings a little dried out and don't mind it a little burned.  It's too bad the flavors were also very bland.  I wasn't even sure which flavor was which.  The wings don't really seem like it was slowed cooked either, just seemed like regular wings.  I probably would have been better off getting wings from Fuel Pizza.    One good thing is they gave me two large blue cheese jars with the wings.  I guess they know you would need a lot to cover the burnt taste and the lack of flavor.  They also have a lot of different beers so it might be a cool place to drink.  That also leads to me believe the reviewers that liked the wings were drunk.    Not sure if I want to even go back for anything else.  If it's southern comfort food, Merts has them beat and it's right around the corner.  I had high hopes since it's close to me...disappointing",

    "text": "Bring on the BBQ!  I was intrigued by Queen City Q as it continued its transition from LaVecchias and whatever the steak place was called that was around for about 2.5 seconds.  Having spent four years in Texas, I'm always on the lookout for some down home cookin'.  The decor is very casual, leveraging the same footprint LaVecchia's left, but adding small country touches like wraught iron and old wood accents.  Plenty of tables, but also enough space between so we didn't feel completely on top of those next to us.  The actual menu was a bit different from their online menu, so don't get your heart set on anything too soon.  I went with a friend for lunch, and both of us were very happy with the experience.  I ordered the 1/4 plate chicken entree, and the chicken was so juicy, I wanted to cry.  Seriously, I don't know how they did it, but I've never before had chicken so moist.  Accompanying my delicious bird wasTexas toast and two sides; I chose my BBQ staples: green bean casserole and macaroni & cheese.  The green bean casserole was lovingly enveloped in a light sauce, with a final touch of cheddar and fried onion crunchy topping.  The macaroni and cheese was also top notch.  Nothing was overly greasy or heavy, and I felt very satisfied and full with my portion size.  My friend ordered the brisket sandwich (yes to the grilled onion topping) with BBQ slaw and said it was great (although he was surprised by the open face-ness of his sandwich).  Worth noting: someone across the restaurant got what appeared to be housemade chips, and I almost walked over, introduced myself, and started eating off his plate - they looked that good.  And was that a blue cheese dipping sauce with it?  If not, get on that, Queen City Q.  When I received the bill, there was a $3 surcharge for white meat with the chicken; I hadn't noticed that extra fee anywhere on the menu, so I asked about it.  Turns out they typically charge that for the 1/2 order of chicken, so our waitress took it off before running my card.  I appreciate her taking it off, but I've got to wonder why it was there anyway, since I neither had been told about the extra cost (the menu gives the option of white/dark), nor had I ordered the 1/2 plate.  Makes me wonder if it was an honest mistake or an attempt to make a few extra dollars.  That being said, my experience was delightful.  Way to go, pitmasters!",

    "text": "Yum!  We went on a Friday and there was quite a bit of the happy hour crowd in the bar area, while the restaurant area was pretty sparse. Now, not being a native to Charlotte the word \"BBQ\" to me hasn't meant pulled pork, it's meant any kind of meat grilled and slathered in BBQ sauce.  So for me when I think of BBQ I think of ribs.  Delicious, juicy, sweet and tangy ribs.  The St. Louis style ribs here are quite tasty (if a little more peppery than I prefer) and slathered in sauce and totally reasonably priced.  I ordered a medium plate but could have done fine with a small plate.  The mac and cheese was totally tasty, and of course the sweet potato fries that are all the rage right now were tasty too.  They have this absurd meat plate where you can get 4 kinds of meat and 2 sides, my cousin had that and was basically immobilized (in a good way). It's totally a nice, clean, casual place to have bbq and brew.  And for the fam factor: no proper changing table, but there was a little bench by the door in the ladies room where I could feed and change my baby in peace.  I love the little touches like that which make a place more family friendly.",

Busy bar, \"club\" type music, \"fancier\" country fare (if that makes sense - this ain't no paw's country cookin') and a generally more \"uptown\" clientele. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, if pricey, food - pulled pork with a bevy of sauces to choose from, wings, mac & cheese, hushpuppies. It might be a tad ambitious - the night I was there (granted it was a Saturday night, right before a Bobcats game), the service was slow and it seemed like the kitchen was very backed up - I wonder if they have too many tables.",

Pork sausage was AMAZING.  Juicy and cooked perfectly, I wished that there was just one more piece on my plate.  The sauces on the table complemented the pulled pork perfectly, with each providing a different, distinct flavor.  Add the sweet potato fries that were crunchy, not soggy, and the baked beans, which had little bits of pork, and you've got bbq heaven.  Just a step below Mac's Speed Shop, but still great!",

    "text": "Went to Queen City Q after going to Imaginon with the kids for lunch. I ordered the brisket my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I also got the wings with their hot sauce. The wings were not to my liking. They are suppose to be smoked ad then grilled but they were very slimy feeling with zero crispiness. The sauce was not what I was expecting being a sweet vinegar sauce with some spice to it. It probably would of been good on some pork but didn't do it for me on the wings. The blue cheese was good but did not compliment the sauce at all. Then the brisket came out large strips that looked like they were grilled which I didn't really get. They were pretty tough as I could not get through it with a knife it just shredded the meat. I have had good brisket and this is some of the worse I have had. No crust couldn't really see a smoke ring very tough not a lot of flavor. The mac n cheese was ok and the hush puppies were ok. The hush puppies are an actual side you have to order and not just part of the meal like every other BBQ place I have ever been to. I would of given 2 stars but my wife game me some of her pork and it was pretty good. SO if you have to go just get the pork and skip the wings.",

    "text": "Checked out Queen City Q before a Charlotte Hornets game.  Just a short walk from the arena, this place is a great option to feed Q fanatics.  Our group ordered a large Q Platter, which is a sampler of the meats they offer.  You can select 2, 3, or 4 different meats.  We went with the large and chose brisket, sausage, pulled pork, and chicken.  We liked all, but the favorites were the sausage and pulled pork.  The brisket was okay, but a different style for the Texans at the table.  Fried okra, mac and cheese, and onion rings rounded out this healthy dinner!  All of the sides were really good.  Atmosphere is nice.  Big, open rooms and a huge bar.  In spite of the pre-game crowd, service was friendly and prompt.  The only downside is their skimpy selection of beer if your taste is more on the Pils or Kolsch side.  They have several craft offerings.  Overall a great experience and look forward to returning.",

Since I was by myself, I grabbed a spot at the bar and was promptly handed a menu from the nice bartender. Asked for a local recommendation for a brewski and decided to go with the Coconut Porter from Noda.   I wasn't too hungry for lunch, but I didn't want to have to buy anything at the airport, so I went with the two tacos - one pulled pork, one brisket - and a side of onion rings. Well, my order wasn't exactly right when it came out, but if you're going to mess up this Southern girl's side order, fried okra is the way to do it. The breading was perfect and they were fried a nice golden brown. Not too gooey on the inside, but not dried out either.   The tacos were a filled to the brim with meat & fixins. Both were drippingly delicious. They have a variety of sauces as most BBQ places do. I tend to stick with the sweet sauce. It added just the right amount of sweetness to each taco. I don't recall what he ordered but my dining mate that was sitting a couple of stools down also had some tasty looking grub.  Would I come back here next time I'm in Charlotte? Definitely!",

That's a win, win for me and off I went for and early dinner. I had such a great time that I stopped by for lunch on another day and also visited just for an adult libation or two or three.  I'm delighted to say these folks earned four stars from me.  I loved the draft list.  Expect a nice selection of local brews.  Whoever selected the beers also made sure there was a nice mix of styles of beer.  That's not always the case and I was impressed.  There is also a substantial bottle list.  Nothing goes better with Q than beer so the start of a good meal is in place.  As I was traveling by myself, I sat at the bar for all of my visits.  That was good news for me because most of the time my bartender was Andrew.  He was friendly and efficient and a great conversationalist.  He also knew his beer. He would have been perfect if he looked like a Victoria's Secret model but hey, I guess you can't have everything!  On one visit I tried the DEVILED EGGS & BACON as an appetizer.  For $4 you get 4.  They were delicious with a big spicy kick.  On different days I tried both the SAUSAGE and the BRISKET.  You know the Q is really excellent when the meats can stand on their own without any additional sauce.  That was absolutely True here.  Both were tender and juicy and packed with flavor.  As with most Q places there is a long list of sides.  I sampled the CORN MAQUE CHOUX. HOUSE CUT FRIES, EASTERN NC BBQ SLAW, and HUSH PUPPIES. All of them were fine but OMG the corn!  I think I moaned when I tasted it.  That's embarrassing!   Expect a platter here with two sides to cost you $12-$16.   The portion sizes are just fine and you'll be full.  When I visit Charlotte again it's certain that I will return.",

I had the good fortune of coming here for the first time with about ten business associates, so I got to try many things.  The pulled pork is really the standout...it really doesn't get much better.  The sauces were decent...but I don't like to need a sauce...and luckily...I didn't.  I liked everything from the decor and ambiance, to the food and libations.  There are however, room for improvements...and that's a great thing!  If I already love your food and the atmosphere...a couple of tweaks only makes you that much better!  The service and the brisket...meh.  The service has been hit and miss on my several visits...but mostly decent.  Like other reviews have mentioned...you just get that...\"I'd so rather be doing something else\" vibe.  Guess what...acting is part of serving...and you'll get better tips.    The brisket was a bit done...and not exactly tender.  Grant it...I only tried it once...but I love brisket...and know the art-form it takes to take a tougher piece of meat to tender and succulent (yea...I heard how strange that one sounded too).  It may have been an off day...but I probably wouldn't order it after that experience.  Lastly, the beer.  Just say yes!  Sweet Josie...I have a hard time choosing any others past you.  You certainly fit in this cowboy's holster.  Giddy-up!  Try:  The Corn Maque Choux for a side  Avoid:  Domestic beer",

The only problem I had was trying to decide which of their many sides I wanted with my meal. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Sigh, I really liked this place. My third time there. Mostly has been pleasant servers and always get the veg burger. Actually, my second coming on my lunch break and the first time was really nice. This time, however, when I walked in on my lunch break, there was no host/hostess nearby. There were a couple of servers meandering around and one who looked like the actual hostess sitting at the bar eating. I finally just seated myself at the bar for fear that if I grabbed a table, I may be ignored. I was anyway. Only having an hour for lunch, and having already spent 15 minutes walking there, I needed to order something quick and simple. Finally, someone who was either one of the kitchen staff or bartender came around and took my order. Not real friendly. He also served the food. That was the kicker. He actually came from around the bar, plopped the plate on the bar, and slid it across to where I was sitting. By the way, there were two tables in the entire place, it was after 2 in the afternoon, so being busy or overwhelmed isn't an excuse for poor service. Won't be back.",

If you not hungry you will by the time you get to the ground floor.   Queen City Q is really nice spot to chill before the game or any event and after. Tons of beers on draft. Nice bar selections and great mixed drinks.   Now the food. I love their pull pork sandwich. I'm just a pulled pork fan but not every one does it right but they do. I love their ribs and you have a selection of sauces at you table to choose from. The staff is great and friendly. If you in uptown you stop by.",

The servers are very attentive and never leave you feeling forgotten. The place is clean and has a nice city/casual vibe. You'll see everyone from families, couples, business professionals, young and old. My husband raves about their hand pulled pork sandwich and I'm a huge fan of their pulled pork quesadilla. They have a variety of sauces to switch it up a bit on return visits and their hush-puppies are SO good with what I think was honey butter. You know it's good when you eat it and you don't even know what it is (lol). Outside seating is available and I like to take advantage of that; along with their house wine by the glass. If you like your banana pudding cold, have at it. A friend and I tried it and it was good but served cold with mostly pudding. I hate that I skipped over the bread pudding but will definitely try that next time. Lastly, I love that it is across the street from First Ward park. You can get your grub on and then go walk it off. Just go! You won't regret the visit.",

They have 2 bars, so you can easily find a seat - and they had $3 NC drafts on a Friday night (not sure what their other deals are).   The food - well you can smell the smoke from the 7th street station and that gets your mouth watering. I had their pulled pork sliders, a couple of smoked wings and their homemade chips. It all left me wanting more. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu and their sauce selection!  Staff was friendly and they validate parking in 7th street station.

I had their hand-pulled pork with collard greens and mac n' cheese, and it was as good as BBQ gets!  The restaurant itself is a nice casual family-oriented place with TVs to keep the men busy. Seemed like a hot spot for young professionals such as myself. Definitely will be revisiting this place in the future!",

I wasn't disappointed. BBQ chicken with Carolina mustard BBQ sauce. This type of sauce was new for me and greatly enjoyed. Tangy and vinegary. The smoke on the chicken was natural and subtle. I had two side--collards (not the way I like them since they were a bit too sweet) and corn choux (something different for me as well and mighty tasty). Service was cordial and efficient. Ate outside but what I saw of the inside restaurant is appealing. One other thing:  Yelp shows restaurant open for only an hour. Big mistake as they have regular business hours. Restaurant should reach out to Yelp and change so as not to deter customers from coming. I'd like to return as well.",

Walked in and the decor was great, I loved the layout. You get to look right into the kitchen and the out-window is pretty much table-side.   Grabbed the dinner menu and a drink menu and was pleasantly surprised to see a pretty large selection of beers and specifically craft beers. My eye immediately caught the beer \"hop drop'n roll\". I thought the name was clever and thought I would try it. It didn't disappoint.  Then I looked at the dinner menu and asked the waiter what he recommended and he pointed me to the Q-Ban Sandwich, I chose the Mac and cheese as my side. The restaurants spin on the Cuban sandwich. Had pulled pork, beef brisket, 3 large juicy pickles, and a top layer of ham it was a perfect mix . The food came out quick. The pickle, and the added SC BBQ added made a perfect sweet sour tangy taste and I fully recommend you try it for yourself.",

My husband and his mom shared one of the Q platters. HUGE servings of four types of meat. They had the ribs, chicken, brisket and pulled pork. The only thing my husband didn't love were the ribs (he thought they were too smoky). But my mom ordered ribs for her dinner, and she loved them. So, I guess it's a personal preference.   I had the brisket and it was perfect. Not too much sauce, and the meat was tender and had a ton of flavor. I think everyone ordered mac and cheese for their side, and we all loved it. My husband had the baked beans with sausage and was really happy with that. The sausage wasn't overwhelming and the beans had good flavor. I had collards that were pretty good. Not as good as what I make at home ;), but still delicious.   We didn't get dessert, but we started with the pimento cheese dip and housemade potato chips. Both were amazing! I was expecting a warm cheese dip, but it was cold, full of flavor and delicious. The chips were sturdy and perfect for it,",

And what's better than BBQ? BBQ ribs, apparently not at QCB. I ordered a rib entree that came out not even hot. I was craving for some good ribs, but my ribs were hard and super disappointing. They felt like left over ribs from the day before. I tapped it with my fork and it was hard. You could literally throw that at someone and kill them. I had to use my knife to get the meat off of the bones. The meat was far tender and good. Even Applebee's and Chili's ribs are better. At least their ribs' meat fall off the bone without me having to use my knife. TERRIBLE!  The potato salad was also a disappointment. I'd rather go buy potato salad at Walmart, but that wasn't the issue. The cole slaw was so tasteless, and I didn't like it at all, so I had asked the waitress to change my side. She told me she wasn't allow to and had to ask her manager first. She disappeared for a while and came back and said the manager allowed her to, so I asked for the onion rings this time. There was this worker standing beside our table the whole time that I was complaining, as if he had nothing to do; obviously he was listening to us. He handed me my onion rings and I have to say, they were alright.  So, the manager took her to the back and even if I didn't hear him, anyone could've tell he was yelling at her. I guessed he didn't allowed her to change my side, but she did it herself. He stood at the corner looking at us for the rest of the time. Seriously? If he had something to say, he needs to say it to me, not stare at me.  So our ticket came out and we were charged for the onion rings. REALLY?   I don't even want to write about this place anymore.",

The bartender at our hotel recommended it to us and we were excited that it was only a few blocks away (I definitely needed that walk home!) I had the beef brisket with Mac and Cheese and coleslaw as a side. The brisket flavor was absolutely melt in your mouth incredible. I also loved that they offered both vinegar coleslaw and mayo based. I was pleasantly surprised that I happen to like Lexington style best.

    "text": "I went here just last night for the Queen City BBQ, Bourbon, and Beer Festival. I don't think it really was a festival though. I imagine the rain had something to do with it, so there was not crowd-gathering corn hole tournament. To be honest, upon walking into the restaurant, it didn't seem like there was a special event going on. There was an impromptu table topper with the specials.   I was really happy with my meal: a crunchy, coleslawy shrimp taco, bbq slider, sweet crispy potato fries and a beer flight. The bbq was smokey and toasty. I tried some of the eastern sauce (NC style vinegar) and it was missing a little pizzaz but was still a great compliement. Very good local and craft beer selection.   Considering there was live music, it wasn't crazy loud just a guy playing some other guy's tunes. The space was not at all like any bbq place I've been to. Not at all smokey, carpeted, or lodge-like. It seemed like they should open it up as a dance hall on weekends. I really think a contra caller would set this place off.  Be sure to park in the 7th st. station parking deck!! Other decks won't take Queen City's validation... That may or may not be a well known fact",

A good way to test out a bar-b-q place is to try their pulled pork sandwich which is what I did the first time I ate there. I was amazed that a place uptown could produce tender pork with so much smoky flavor. Their sauces compliment the pork very well too. Stop by next time you're in the area and I guarantee you won't leave disappointed.",

    "text": "I have came here a few times and I think it's time to have an overall opinion of this place.  Food 4 stars They just made some changes to the menu, which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint.  Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better, 6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth, pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better.  The kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs, I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor, but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn, which tastes even better the next day.    Service 3 stars While I never had bad services here, I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order, which I think for a newer joint like this, a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.  Same with beer suggestion. People, this place has a beer selection!  Again, the bartender has always been ok, but an extra wow factor can make a difference.   Location/Atmosphere 3.5 stars This used to be levacchia. Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much. Making it a little nicer and bigger than what you think a BBQ joint should be.  It is huge frankly.  It is right next to the light rail stop.  They validate parking which is great for arena events.   A little disclaimer: I met the owners, who invited a few people to taste the new menu.  Is my review skewed because of it.  Never. But I learned a few things about the place and felt the heart they put into everything.  And it makes me want to see this place strives. I mean, they actually promise they will always have the Panthers games on, with volume!  Come and try them out. Budget conscious alert: 3 words. LATE NIGHT MENU. 2 more words. DRINK SPECIALS. After 9 or 9:30pm. I know y'all are not in bed yet.  Oh wait, 2 more words. FREE PARKING!",

While we waited for our food, we were able to take advantage of their beer selection-they had beers starting at $1.75/each (I guess they do this on Saturdays, not sure what their other daily specials are). My sister and I ordered the pulled pork and it was amazing. They provide a decent variety of BBQ sauce and for the price, it's really hard to beat. Service was quick and efficient as well and I will definitely come back the next time I am in Charlotte (4 1/2 stars).",
