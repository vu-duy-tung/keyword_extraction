We had 2 servers show up at our table and think we got the short end of stick. She was not attentive. My husband got his meal and was almost finished eating before she came back to the table. When I got her attention, she said I didn't order anything for you. Not sure how that happened, but she better be happy that my husband paid the bill.  He left her a tip and I would not have. We asked for ketchup and she came back sat least five minutes later with packets of ketchup, saying \"I couldn't find a bottle.\"",

    "text": "Really let down by this new spot in Uptown. First impression: decor was neat and different, made it seem like a fun atmosphere.  It wasn't too crowded for only being a month old, but we waited about 10 minutes for a table for 2.  We noticed they had a raw bar and we decided to order steamed shrimp to start and it was very disappointing. No flavor and overcooked but we gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe a bad batch.  We ordered the shrimp and grits which was alright at best, seasoning was pretty good,  but the plate was just \"alright\" (other than the bread that came with the order which seemed almost 2 weeks too stale).  My order was the 1/2 chicken plate and it may of been the worst chicken I've ever had...and that's a big claim.  It was so dry, you couldn't swallow the meat without water and the flavor was so plain, cardboard may have had a little better taste. We actually had to take some seasoning from shrimp and grits to put on the chicken to make it some what edible.  The small waffle that came along with the plate was burnt to a crisp, the fries seemed like frozen grocery store fries.  The only decent part of the plate was the beans and Cole slaw, which weren't the best I've ever had, but helped the cause of the meal.  I'm not one to complain about food to the waitress's or at restaurant so we powered through our meal and left with a smile.  No complaints about the service, very nice people; the decor and the prices were really great, but based on our dinner, it would be hard to get me to come back here.",

    "text": "The only reason this review gets one star is because the wine was good and 1/2 price and the bartenders were able to actually fulfill an order. 'Surly' would be a good descriptor but in comparison to our server, who was probably high, they were little angels.  Our food order was never put in. Our second order of wine was spilled on the floor - only to not be mopped up by anyone. I mean, I would have been able to find a mop and clean it up faster than the employees. And - I doubt anyone would have noticed a customer looking around in closets for a mop because NO ONE seemed to be looking after the place as a whole.  When I brought this to the attention of the host, I was told that we could leave if we wanted and sorry about what happened. But I'm hungry and sober. Seems like the opposite of how a bar/restaurant wants their patrons to leave. Shocking. Avoid this place like the plague unless you want to risk red wine spilled over you followed with a side order of hunger.",

But the service is terrible and there's 0 customer service. After waiting almost 2 hours for a table we go to the hostess stand to check and see that the hostess had taken the wrong cell phone number down and had given our table away. We tried to do ask a manager but all he said was that we could wait some more (30 more minutes?!) or split us up between booths. Finally we were sat and ordered food. That ended up being a disappointment too, a friend and I ordered breakfast potatoes and they were burnt to a crisp. Inedible. Another friend of mine waited 30 min for her potatoes after not receiving them with her food originally. They looked normal and edible and drastically different than mine. We called another manager to the table and showed him what was being served (I mean so burnt you should not and could not  serve it) and he apologized and went to the kitchen to get more. I appreciated it but I still don't know what the kitchen thinks food is or why the wait staff would think it was okay to serve something like that. All in all a disappointing experience, especially one for a birthday. I might just be back for drinks",

Was told that arriving at 6:00 \"you'll be fine.\" Pressed a bit, she amended that to, \"You shouldn't have to wait more than 30 minutes.\"  Hmm.  When you have 8:00 performance tickets, that doesn't work. Restaurants -- even hip ones that have created an \"excited buzz\" around themselves -- need to be more considerate of customers' needs and schedules. And so we'll be spending our money elsewhere.",

The most memorable thing about the visit was that the staff seemed very disjointed and unaware about pretty much everything.   Our group of four was seated pretty quickly and we approached by a waitress who brought us all waters as we decided on our drink orders. They have a great selection of different kinds of Bloody Marys, and we all ordered a different one. After about 7-8 minutes, the waitress comes back and announces that they don't have the ingredients for the Bloody Mary that I ordered. I was taken aback that A) They did not have the ingredients and B) It took nearly ten minutes to figure out. I just went with a standard Bloody after that.   Drinks came out and we had some questions about the menu, which we MOSTLY answered by the waitress. I chose the Grillades and Grits and was not disappointed. The chefs and cooks certainly knew what they were doing even if no one else was on the same page. We wrapped things up pretty quickly after that as two of our group had to catch a flight.  Overall disappointed with the confusion throughout the visit, but for a newer restaurant with very good food, I would like to give them another chance at some point.",

The restaurant is very big and open, but I felt like the decor did not match what was going on inside. It's this cool trendy decor but there were TVs everywhere with labels for which sports games would be shown and there was a DJ playing club music... all of this was happening during Sunday brunch. Definitely a bizarre combination of things.  Anyway, I ordered off the brunch menu and was really pleased with my selection. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was excellent and my waffles were pretty typical waffles. I was full afterwards and they were delicious. My suggestion is to serve 100% pure maple syrup with meals as opposed to the high fructose corn sugar syrup. For an upscale restaurant uptown, I was expecting real syrup.  I also ordered a cocktail - it was a berry drink with limencello... yummm. It had real crushed strawberries and excellent fruit flavor. It was also pretty strong, which is good. I loved that.   My total bill was around $25 including tip (and I always tip at least 20%). This is good for a drink and a full meal.   I will definitely be back to Ink N Ivy. I think they're still trying to work out some of the \"new\" kinks as well as communication among staff. I do recommend giving it a go, as the food and drinks were delicious.",

The manager came up and apologized and did the manager thing but seriously f'ing up a meal twice, come on guys. Over it. The only thing they have going is the ambience but it's still a cluster.  Second time, last night for the fight. I came dressed nice, had a jacket on and didn't look like a scumbag or any type of person that is going to be shady, which I've seen plenty of them go through these doors. First off, I called, they didn't answer had to call again. I finally talked to someone and they were charging a $20 cover for the fight. Which to me I don't understand at all but whatever, then they said we have tables available and put me on hold. Then when whoever came on I couldn't hear them because their phones were static and I kept saying hello and nothing. Not my daily. Fix your phones!  So I walked down there, I asked how much is the table. They said $400. WTF!!!! $400 for a table for what? For nothing. None of the $400 even went towards food or drinks. Help me understand how on earth this is reasonable?? And whoever paid for that is dumb. I haven't been in a while because of my first experience so I wanted to check it out again. He said either way it's $20. I'm not paying $20 to stand and see with a bunch of other idiots. So I ended up leaving.   I will never be back again.

But I'm to old to stand all night and deal with excessive crowds and pushing. Their is barely any seating, unless you sit on the restaurant side-- which kind of runs into the bar. The atmosphere is nice here and it's decorated nicely.But it's a really busy spot and gets crowded really quick. We also had to travel around the bar in a full circle because none of the bartenders made the speciality drinks listed on their menu. Like what do you mean try another bartender? Luckily I came comfy and not dressed to impress. I think I will have to pass on visiting here again, not my crowd and I don't feel like going on a \"where is Waldo hunt\" for a drink on YOUR menu.",

    "text": "Overall 3 stars. We went on a Wednesday night for a friend's dinner. The place had a good crowd, but the majority of it was at the bar, certainly not overly busy. The best thing about this place was by far the atmosphere - the decor is fun and eclectic and the patio is huge.  If not for the environment this would have been a 2 star review.   Service: Our waiter was very nice but not very aware of our table space. We had collected a pretty hilarious amount of cocktail glasses at the end of the table which were not picked up until the very end of dinner. Additionally, our oyster plate took up the majority of our area and was there about 30 minutes longer than it should have been.   Food: Ink N Ivy seems to be a better place for bar-style appetizers than for sit down dinner. We started with the mussels which were the first disappointment for the evening, being overly cooked and served with stale bread. The curry sauce served with it was good, but didn't compensate for the mushy mussels. We ordered the nachos which had large slices of jalapenos and were my highlight from the menu.   For entrees, our table ordered the pasta jambalaya, chicken sandwich, maple glazed salmon, and grilled scallops. Reportedly, the chicken sandwich was good, but the jambalaya was a huge disappointment. The salmon and scallops were on par with the mussels - flavored well, but severely over cooked. The scallops had a rubbery texture and the salmon was dried out. Very disappointing for a meal that had so much potential.",

My drink was poorly made as well as my girlfriends that were with me, and when I politely sent it back she told me, \"to go ahead and look at the wine list\". So that told me in itself not to order drinks from her again. Overall the experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't exactly serene either. She also proceeded to yell across the restaurant to our server saying that \"I didn't like the drink and to ring in the wine\". It was extremely unprofessional. I believe her name was Michelle.",

    "text": "Update: On 8/25/17 I returned to Ink N Ivy with an out of town guest, because of my previous experience at the restaurant. As always the atmosphere was perfect. It was a Friday night so there was pretty decent music playing, a little louder than normal which gave it more of a lounge/club feel which I enjoyed. On this particular night we had a server name Allison (per my receipt) and she was absolutely terrible and was not attentive to our needs at all. I was quite shocked by the extremely poor customer service we received on this particular night. We literally had to flag her down if we needed anything and she brought us our checks without inquiring whether or not we were ready for them. The food was also nothing like it was the first time I came, and our grits were cold.  I ordered shrimp and grits, which was quite tasty and seasoned perfectly, however as I mentioned the grits were cold. My friend had crab cakes and grits which she barely touched because she wasn't satisfied with the taste or temperature. I am not sure I would give this place another try after the experience I had last night. That is why I am changing my review from 5 to 2 stars. However, if you are looking for a trendy spot with decent music on Friday and Saturday nights, this isn't a bad choice. I just hope you receive better customer service.  Ink N Ivey is one of the best restaurants I have honestly been to in awhile. Its super cute and trendy and the customer service is outstanding!!! The genetlemen at the valet desk were nice, however the hostess could have used some work, she wasn't the most friendly but she wasn't down right rude either. We had the best bartender name Hayley, with red hair. From the time we stepped up to the counter to order a drink while we wait, all the bartenders took note of us and kept checking in to see if we were good or needed something. We ended up staying at the bar even when our table was called. My sister in law and I ordered a seafood platter which was just ok and not seasoned the best, but the presentation of the food was awesome. The food did take quite some time to come out but honestly we were drinking and talking so that wasn't too bad. The drinks are reasonably priced and honestly so is the food. The platter we got was a little pricey, but that was because it consisted of oysters, mussels, shrimp and a couple different kinds of crab legs. It was definitely a special treat. Even the servers walking around were pleasant and helpful. I will DEFINITELY go back!",

Our waiters during those visits were literally non existent, it got to the point where anytime a runner or random waiter would bring us something, we'd just start placing random orders for things knowing it would take forever to be relayed to our actual waiter and then brought over. Yeah, the patio area is nice overlooking the park, and it's def a Sunday funday spot, but it's gotten to the point where dealing with bad service on top of average food just isn't worth it.",

The hostess seemed unsure about the wait and they seemed frustrated. She wrote down my name and number and put it on a list.  She warned me that the kitchen was backed up and that brunch was limited. I was disappointed because I specifically came for brunch. After waiting 30 minutes I went up to check myself she said there was still a wait. I told her to take me off the list.  After sitting on the patio a few minutes a sever came over and got us drinks while we waited. I was very happy that they were so gracious even while I was waiting. The patio is very nice and the view is amazing. We sat at a patio table and we had to order lunch because they ran out of brunch. The food took about 20 minutes to come out, which I wasn't happy about. I got the oyster Po boy and a fries. My fries were cold. The sandwich was good but the baguette was way too thick. I got the $2 mimosas and a Poison Ivy to drink. Both were good! Great service but this restaurant needs help in the kitchen.",

The eggs Benedict were ok. My Eggs were over cooks which bothered me. Then again it was SUPER busy that day. However no excuse. Regardless I'm still willing to give this place a chance.   I recently seen the patio! It's stunning. Best time to visit is during the evening. You can see all the beautiful lights uptown. Also, don't forget to bring your dogs! I'm looking forward to bringing mines!   With summer around the corner, I imagine this place will get packed!!! No they don't take reservations so arrive wicked early to enjoy!",

We have never ordered food here because their menu is very limited and doesn't have any healthy options.  They also have an inside bar and seating, which is very big, with lots of TVs, so it is a good place to watch games and you can usually get a spot near whatever game you'd like to watch.",

For an appetizer, I got the Mac n Greens and WOW. I always thought I was weird because growing up I loved that combination, but when I saw it on the menu here I got super excited and had to try it. It was soooo good I could have eaten 10 more bowls if my stomach had room. For my entree I had the salmon with asparagus. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the asparagus was just how I like it. Next time in Charlotte I will be back. Oh also I really liked the drinks they had that were like an adult Capri sun. Gotta get one of those again.",

The music was bumping definitely a good place to come for those who still wanna keep the party going from last night. The hostess group made several recommendations. The waiter didn't he was busy and not available. I would of been very upset if I wasn't so engulfed in my conversation and the person I was with. It took a while for the food to come out, but it was a good portion size and good food. I had the chicken and waffles which are bone out chicken strips and the waffle is light and fluffy. The omelet was noted by my friend as being good. He ate all of it or cleared his plate. This place is fun, modern and sleek. I recommend for brunch but don't expect great service do expect good food and nice decor.",

I had reservations, but it was smart to inform me to save everyone time.  Despite having reservations, the wait was still longer than anticipated. I was here for a birthday party and decor was provided, which the restaurant gave no fuss about putting out in the manner prescribed by the birthday dinner hostess. The only issue with service is they kept calling us \"sweetie\". A little petty, but this is not okay.   The downside was food. I had nachos and they were luke warm. So were the fried oysters on my friend's salad. Aside from mussels, nothing was particularly tasty. Much room for improvement with food.  The best part of Ink N Ivy were the intangibles. It has an overall good vibe. The venue is VERY large. Great place for a big party. There was a also a mixed crowd, old... young... all races & religions. Background music was a upbeat pop from the 99 and the 2000s. I would come back by here to hang out. It surely is an amazing happy hour spot. If you're starving, choose elsewhere. If you're ready to be social, Ink n Ivy is the way to go.",

Place was rather loud and busy; seems a popular spot for happy hour.  I ordered a Poison Ivy cocktail to start.  A bit too sweet from the syrup for me, so I switched to white wine after my first cocktail.    For appetizers we ordered a dozen oysters and the fried cheese recommended by the server.  However, server came back and said they ran out of the fried cheese.  The oysters were good.  For my entree, I had the daily special of clams & linguine.  It was average.  The weird part is when a member of our party attempted to order a beer.  The first beer he attempted, they told him they ran out.  The second beer, they said they were out of glasses.  What? Then, they attempted to serve drinks at our table that we didn't order.    Seems this place has some quirks to work out.  We did stay at the bar for an additional round and a snack and its festive atmosphere to do so.",

Medium rare and hot. Shared with my friend so I get to tried some waffles and chicken. I know that it's made with buttermilk but has a seasoning that I can't put my finger on.. waffles was light/airy. Chickens was crispy.. Steak was seasoned right. The meal was overall enjoyable!

Margarita Mimosa- not bad, but I'd stick with the regular mimosa.  My Meal..  Small Salad w/ ranch- Excellent! I got the mixed greens, cucumbers, and cheese. Incredible it was only $3. Located under sides, it seamed like a full size salad to me. What a great deal!    Mac-n-cheese- was very disappointing. It had a smoked or bacon type flavor.  Seasonal Veggies- very good for the first order, however the second order was way over salted.   My friend's meal..  Shrimp and grits- mehh! She ate the shrimp and the toast.

For my food and a couple of martinis, I was pushing about $45. However, if you want to grab a bite before a night out then this place turns into a lounge with a DJ after 10:30pm or so. So the $45 would actually be the cost of club hopping if you went to multiple spots uptown.   Overall, I think this spot is a cool addition to the Charlotte nightlife. Not to mention, the Shrimp and Grits are AMAZING!!",

I have been here several times, typically frequent on Sunday's at the bar however this was the WORST experience I have had (also if it matters it was my birthday). Sooo we arrive around 10pm, not really a big crown so we get seated rather quickly. The server comes (I won't state his name), takes our drinks orders and 10 mins later returns to take our dinner order without drinks in hand. I view it as a simple oversite bc I love to grant people the benefit of a doubt however it only gets worse. 15 additional minutes pass and our drinks are served. I am dining with a vegan who has a dairy allergy and advices the server of this however when the food finally arrives, there is feta cheese in his Brussels sprouts. The remainder of the dinner was only saved by the amazing atmosphere and other servers starting small talk. I hope this is viewed by someone on management bc honestly I would hate for my favorite go to to become a past tense venue.",

They have a large list of \"social eats\" or big sharing dishes on the apps menu.  Our group of 5 chose to order a bunch of social eats and get individual salads. The 4 grilled Caesars went over well as did the 1 chopped ivy salad. Our share dishes included the Seared Ahi Tuna Wantons, Grilled Brussel Sprouts, Edemame, and Fried Calamari, and Lamb Lollichops. Portions are generous, the food came out hot and tasty. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the comfortable evening. Service was four stars.",

    "text": "The patio vibe is awesome. We visited for Sunday brunch. It was pretty crowded both inside and out. We sat outside with a short wait.   We were greeted and given drinks promptly by our server, Emili, whom we adored. The $4 Bloody Mary bar was full of variety in both mixers and additions. The $4 double mimosa might give it a run for its money.   I contemplated ordering the smoked chicken salad wrap or the steak salad. They were out of the wrap, so I went with the salad. I ordered my steak medium but it came out well done. It tasted fine, so I did not send it back. The flavor was good, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Nothing special. The buffalo chicken sandwich my hubby ordered was a huge portion, cooked well, and was very tasty. I ordered a side of fries with my salad. The brunch menu side of fries is $3 while the lunch menu side is $5. We were charged $5, but they fixed it to $3. Apparently, one of the menus need to be updated.   There are multiple $6 parking decks around, with immediate parking beside the building for $8. We were lucky to find a parallel spot right in front of Romare Bearden for free. From what we've heard, they don't validate for parking costs.   Overall, we will be back for the cool vibes, drink specials, and the hip crowd. Especially when the weather is nice.",

They brought use bowls of ice water for the dogs and kept checking on them to make sure they were okay.

Food is decent bar food but the service leaves A LOT to be desired.  The hostess staff mimics the hostess staff from the movie Date Night, rude and stuck up in a way that is pretty comical but still not appropriate for what you would expect a front of house staff to be. To be fair, we've always had great, friendly waitresses.  They have a good variety of beers and mimosa deals on Sunday's but that's if you can even get a table. We stopped for brunch one day and were quoted a 3 hour wait. 3 hours?!!! Entirely not acceptable for a casual bar restaurant. When we were walking out the door to another restaurant all we saw were open tables, waitstaff standing around, and a good amount of people who decided they wanted to wait hours for a table, so clearly understaffed in the kitchen as well.  Sigh, this place has huge potential being in a great location and having great ambiance but they need a major revamp on the staff.",

I got a chicken salad wrap for lunch with the seasonal vegetables (zucchini and yellow squash). The yellow squash was so hard I couldn't even pierce it with my fork! I got done with my first half of my wrap and actually really enjoyed it, but after I took 1 bite of my second half of my sandwich I nearly choked on a huge piece of rock solid fat. I tried another bite and got several more pieces in my wrap. I lost my appetite and asked for the check.  I paid for a full wrap and side and ate half a wrap and picked the zucchini from the side dish. I wanted to like this place because of the location and I heard they have a Bloody Mary bar, but they have some serious improving to do first.  Also, while I was trying to eat a customer was complaining right next to me to the bartender (he had every reason to, but not the best eating environment). He was upset because the kitchen messed up his order 3 times and he was just ordering to go on his lunch break.",

When I got the dish the eggs were fried hard and the grits had the consistency of rice. We told the waitress and she promptly sent it back for real eggs Benedict and better grits. What I got back could have been worse. I got eggs that were over easy and grits that resembled rice. I didn't send this back because it was obvious that this restaurant did not know how to do such a simple breakfast item. We did have great wait staff and the drink specials are excellent.

I did have one server that was great but other than that it's a joke. They have a bar manager is that more concerned with hitting on girls than helping the staff. Which brings me to my next point. the bar staff does not seemed to be properly trained to handle high volume. I have been here 5 times and every single time the bar is a disaster.

I enjoyed the chicken and waffles while my husband devoured ship and grits, both of our meals were great! I also got a Bloody Mary from the Bloody Mary bar, I personally love Bloody Mary bars and thought 4 bucks was a steal! Would definitely return! Great weekend in CLT, thanks Alyssa!",

After being seated, Case greets us with a warming smile and takes care of everything in a friendly and welcoming attitude. First visit was amazing and will not be my last. What a great atmosphere and friendly staff. The classic nachos definitely hit the spot.",

Unfortunately, I can't confirm- we sat the bar, bar was only semi-busy, bartender and bar-back passed by us several times without acknowledging us.

We turned away, leaving our names but with little intention of sticking around. Door man intervened as we were leaving to tell us to just go sit at a table when someone eventually got up. That was an awkward and annoying experience overall. He assured us it wouldn't be the full wait.  We didn't go take a table, just stuck around and waited about a half hour and were seated. Gave me plenty of time to absorb the absurd decor of the restaurant. Food was fine for regular bar food, but I felt as though it was attempting to be presented in gourmet fashion. In that context, I didn't enjoy. The cocktails were excellent.   Disorganized unprofessional experience. I like the other restaurants this group does bc they stay in their lane of 'bar food' which is where it belongs. This place has a tacky appearance and tries to be something that it's not. Good drink spot, awful food spot.",

    "text": "I gave it one star because it wouldn't let me give zero.  Where to start?  Of course this place opened with a lot of hype but I was admittedly skeptical.  I'm familiar with other \"restaurants\" from this ownership group.  They are clearly better at running a bar than a restaurant.    Walking in the door my first impression was the decor is tacky, but it's unique so that counts for something.  It wasn't very crowded so my friend and I got a table right away.  They had an impressive looking Bloody Mary bar going, I didn't feel like making one myself so I ordered one from our server and had them make it.  It was solid, kinda hard to screw those up.  So we ordered from the brunch menu since it was early afternoon on a Saturday.  And this is about as far as we got....  After about an hour or so we told our server (who was nice and I felt bad for her) that if our food wasn't ready we were leaving.  About this time I overheard a nearby table discussing with a manager about their wait time and the food they just received was cold.   Our sever had not returned after about another 10 mins so I left cash for my drink and we walked out.    Wouldn't bother me a bit if this place doesn't make it.  Too many great options in this town so wasting time here again will be a hard sell for me.",

I had the poison ivy, the inkwell, and a Bloody Mary so far. The inkwell was very strong and I wouldn't recommend it, but others were great! I also had the pork quesadillas with goat cheese which were amazing! The second time I couldn't wait to try the goat cheese burger and was pretty disappointed. I'm a goat cheese fiend and you couldn't even taste it. The burger itself was really good, just wish I could've tasted the reason I ordered it. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu though as food quality is very good! However, if you go on a weekend expect it to be packed! Lunch time during the week is the least busy I've seen it. On Sunday they have a Bloody Mary bar that is amazing!",

With plenty of vacant tables, I was surprised at the 10 minutes it took to seat my party of 1 for lunch. I wasn't interested in a seat at the bar.. never heard of a 1-person lunch? Confusing.. As far as the menu.. there was nothing that screamed \"try me!\" But that could be my lack of appreciation for oysters. IMO the prices for the starters are on the high side, but such is uptown dining I guess. I planned to order the shrimp tacos, but per my server's suggestion I tried the salmon BLT instead. It was delicious!! I really enjoyed it, nice twist on a burger. I got a side of fries which were nothing special, but there was also an option to substitute so that's good.  All in all, I would return and try other menu items, I hear that the fried oysters and the shrimp tacos are good so I want to see for myself. I also would love to see what the dinner menu has to offer.",

I didn't recall the food being great the first time I visited. It was good, but nothing that made me have a craving. We shared some small plates. There are meals too if you want a full meal. The brussel sprouts were amazing! They were crisp and there was a spicy sauce drizzled on top that took them to the next level. I also had the spaghetti squash fritters which were okay. And I also tried some roasted potatoes. They were okay, but pretty basic as far as flavors go.   This is a cool place to hang out at after work or before a game.",

Their food...... yeah just drinks. They need to revise their food menu a bit and knock up the quality of their ingredients. At over priced and doesn't taste that god honestly and I have had dinner here 4 or 5 times.  They do give you a nice size glass of wine!!   It is a good place to come hang out with friends for a drink, even though their nickname is the Chilis of Uptown.",

Overall, we really like the vibe, the eclectic menu, the drink variety, and the location. I haven't had a meal here that I didn't like, and this is a great place for a date night, lunch with friends, or a big group - very accommodating space. However, where Ink N Ivy needs to improve is with the friendliness of wait staff. More often than not, I've gotten the impression that I'm bothering the server just by being there. I don't know that I've ever walked out and thought \"wow he/she was really pleasant to be around.\" Maybe that's a nitpick, and maybe that's part of the vibe they're going for, but I have not yet had a friendly, non-transactional server. Hopefully they improve in that area because this restaurant truly is one of our favorites!",

We didn't mind that much since we didn't make reservations and expected that with a nice and trendy restaurant in the heart of downtown.  We were able to find a spot right at the bar to get drinks and converse while we waited. We were greeted right away by the bartender and didn't have to wait at all, which is nice especially since once it gets later on a weekend it becomes harder to get a drink at the bar because it gets so busy.  I had a moscow mule and I was very pleased with it. Once we were seated, our server greeted us right away. Excellent service! My friends picked from restaurant week and I decided to just get calamari and edamame. I love calamari and was not impressed. It was ok. It was room temperature and there was not any seasoning in the breading. Thank goodness for the sauce or else it would have been extremely bland.   I would suggest this for a happy hour or pre-going out drinks spot. It's fun once it gets a little later at night. So go for drinks, bar atmosphere, and the patio",

I was shocked to see that there was no seasoning. In addition the burger was room temp. I was severly disapointed. My friend ordered the brunch salmon and breakfast potatos of which both were dry and also lacked flavor.   My waitress was sweat though.",

All of the food was very well done and m, thankfully, they seem to care more about quality than presentation. The food was EXCELLENT. The wings were okay / a bit smokier than I wanted but still good.

ALL OTHER bartenders especially the ones up front in the main bar are SUPER SLOW and they have their faces like they don't want to work ( why come to work in the 1st place!!??) It literally took more than 10 mins when there were only few people waiting for a drink, they were just chatting like there was no work to do.   Keep on mind I've been coming here at least 10 times and they all have been always slow. I guess fight night had it for me and I had to post a review at last .",

Areas of improvement which are to be expected with popularity and it being the first weekend are the waiting times to be seated ranged from 45mins to 2 hours depending on group size. Ambience outside by the bar was very nice. Inside setting and atmosphere was very nice the food ordered was quick to be severed.  Appetizers were quesadillas and honey siracha wings were were both very impressive. Main entrees fillet mignon one serve well & other medium well along with lumb fresh crab cakes and potatoes. Drinks were an apple martini without the cherry and a crown and ginger. They were small areas of improvement but that's what to be expected when it's your second night being open; but overall the food was very tasty and the atmosphere lively with a large crowd.",

However, I would not order a drink other than beer or wine. I ordered a cocktail named \"The Gentleman\" ($13) and received what I can only describe as a $3 well drink. The glass was filled with ice and mixer. The amount of whisky was so thin that it barely tinted the glass. I should have sent it back but drank it and it tasted like a $3 well drink. My wife ordered a gin martini that also came with lots of ice in the glass. Who puts ice in a gin martini? It could have been a bad bartender or this place has cheap ownership/management trying to squeeze margins with watered down cocktails. Also, the staff was a bit rude as our waitress literally threw the check down in front of me at the end of service after she stopped at our table every five minutes asking if we wanted to order more drinks. Our waitress didn't know the difference between a gin drink and a whisky drink as she placed my wife's gin martini in front of me and told me it was my whiskey drink. I said, \"I believe the whisky drink is the brown one in front of my wife.\" Her response was, \"then switch the drinks.\" Not a big deal but when the drinks are full of ice and the waitress doesn't know the difference between basic alcohol, it tells me all I need to know about the quality of the cocktails in this establishment. If I go back, I'll order a beer (I assume they don't water down the beer) and save my cocktails for a place like Copper on East Blvd or the Punch Room Uptown.",

We had a group of 9 people and it was a disaster from the beginning.   1) We were seated around 8:15PM with no silverware. 2) We proceeded to order a bottle of wine. We were told there was only 1 bottle of Sauvignon Blanc left so it would be a few minutes while they chilled it. We waited ONE HOUR. Meanwhile, we walked up to the bar to order a bottle of wine and got a bottle immediately in a bucket of ice. We shared this information with the Manager. 3) We all ordered appetizers and asked for plates and silverware. We never received them, so we ate the food with our fingers. 4) When it came to the entrees, half of the table got their entrees 30 minutes before the other half of the table. 5) I ordered grilled salmon. Initially they brought out my order and it was incorrect. They realized this before putting it on the table and took it back. 6) 30 minutes later the grilled salmon was served. I cut into it and it was raw in the center. I walked up to the manager with the salmon, showed him the salmon, and he shared that this was the correct way to cook the salmon. I asked him to cook it for longer. He was incredibly rude when speaking to me. 7) After paying the bill, I finally got my salmon back.  The entire dinner took nearly 3 hours from the time we were seated to us leaving. We expressed our concerns to both the waitress and the manager. They did comp a bottle of wine for the table and a few entrees which was nice. However, the experience was very disappointing as we were celebrating a friend's birthday. I would not recommend this restaurant unless they improve their service.",

We were both not impressed. Based on those 2 things I wanted to give this place 3 stars and leave. But I said we had a main course and maybe we could save the review. The drink tasted just like club soda only. the shrimp tacos were very bland. we order the salmon and the goat cheese burger for a main course and OMG!!! it was so good. everything about it was good. scallop potatoes are a must. the salmon was so tender. the burger was great  (I don't eat beef but BF said it was amazing lol) So overall, I would say the vibe is nice at the place and i can see why lots of people go, just don't order apps. It was also a little pricey for my take but hey I tried it out.",

I showed her the yelp message I got, manager came out and said \"Well I guess your meal is in us today\". Quick & easy :) The last time we came, most of our party disliked their food. Could've been an off night, idk. This time everyone liked their food. I had the crab cakes with sauteed spinach and mac & cheese (mac & cheese could use some tweaking). Quesadillas, burgers and nachos were also ordered and everyone was happy. Atmosphere is still great. They have a good vibe overall. Will be back again. Hope the service and food will mimic my 2nd time here. Oh and my drink was on the house too. Not shabby at all :)",

Then the server seemed to have an attitude the entire time serving us. The food was terrible, we started with the spinach dip and it taste like it came out of a microwave. For my dinner I had the Ink Burger, it was bland and burnt.  I've never had a bad burger in my life, this was a first for me. And then the signature cocktails were very underwhelming as well and very expensive for what your paying for. It seems like this place doesn't put any effort into make the actual operations good, they just rely on the look of the place and location. Overall, this experience was a waster of time and money. I would not recommend coming here, there are much better options throughout the city.",

    "text": "3.5. I came to Ink and Ivy with some co-workers during the week. There were 6 of us, so I called ahead to make a reservation, however they said they didn't take reservations- dumb. We arrived around 1:00pm and waited about 10 minutes for our table. It was on a Friday and the place was pretty packed.  The inside of Ink & Ivy was pretty funky.  It was a mix between a cocktail lounge, bar and restaurant. They have plenty of big TVs throughout, which is great for sporting events and they have a HUGE outdoor patio. It was cold so we sat inside, but I imagine this place will be popping once it warms up.  My group was greeted by our server upon seating and we were made aware of their Friday drink special- $5 Titos. Score! The menu consists of a variety of different options- from seafood (a lot), salads, soups and sandwiches. I heard the menu changes for dinner and they also have a raw bar.  I ordered the tomato soup and the grilled cheese because I felt like being a kid. Others got the pulled pork sandwich and salads. The \"creamy\" tomato soup was super chunky, but had great flavor. The grilled cheese on the other hand looked pathetic. Everyone laughed and said it looked like they ran over to the 7-11 and purchased white bread and threw a piece of cheese on it. For $11 I was expecting something better. My coworkers said the pulled pork sandwich and salad were good through.  Overall, I hope Ink & Ivy does well in this location as it was totally lacking something in this space for a long time.  I'm not sure if I'll be back in a hurry for food, but the patio and drinks are worth a visit.",

This time when we walked in there was four people at the host station and not one of them acknowledged us. We were the only people standing there too. So we stood there waiting for them to be done talking to each other.   Then they sat us at a table and it was so loud it was a bit ridiculous. The football game was on which was cool but at every commercial their DJ would blast his music so we pretty much had to yell to talk to each other and I would understand this if we had gone to a club but it's a restaurant.     We got two appetizers, shrimp tacos and the fried cheese. Both were really good! That fried cheese, Wow!! But then we ordered food I got the BBQ platter, which was smoked chicken, ribs, pork and andouille sausage, I was very excited for it! My fiance got the chipotle lime chicken. Both were underwhelming. Everything on my platter was bland. The andouille was ok but everything else wasn't worth it. And his pasta was just very lime-y, again not worth it.   We talked to our server and she told her manager. He came over to us and was very nice and did take my meal off the bill. We really appreciated it. We really wanted to like ink n ivy because our first time there was so great! But we really aren't sure we'll be returning.   We happened to go on their first official night open, we were looking for somewhere casual and new to try before we headed to a show.   We sat at the bar inside which was packed. The bartender was very nice but very overwhelmed, first nights are hard! We got a drink menu and food menu. They had a number of specialty cocktails and tons of small dishes and hand helds to eat OH plus a raw bar! I got the poison ivy cocktail which was sweet but delicious and my boyfriend got the Morgan's mule also good.   We orders spicy fried oysters and shrimp tacos which were on the \"snack\" menu. They were good sized portions and the presentation of each was lovely. The fried oysters were just spicy enough and served with black bean pure and salsa, I would definitely get them again. The shrimp tacos came on corn tortillas and were a little spiced but not overwhelming. We decided we were still hungry so we got the quesadillas to split. They can come with pulled pork or chicken and we opted for the chicken which I was so happy with. The quesadillas were amazing and I would go back just for them!   All in all service was great and the food was delicious. It was a little pricy but what can ya do, it seemed worth it for the portions and quality.",

We got waters and ordered a Tequila mule. 5 mins pass, 10 mins pass, 20 mins pass and I finally went to the bar and reordered my drink because she didn't bring it. Then she comes over when she saw me with the mule and says \"sorry I forgot your drink, they gave you cherries right?\" -- so that shows me she remembered my order but failed to even put the order in. Then I ask for a second one because I knew it would take her forever to come back to order another one and the one she brought tasted soooooo gross. She said she made it the right way... not to mention she's the type that comes to the table once every 35 mins. Thennnnnnnn we asked for the check and she brings us the wrong one. It was half of the price of my actual bill. And I had to tell her it was wrongs she gave me a bill for $36 and my actual bill was $70. You almost lost money. Emma needs a lot of training. And I do mean A LOT OF training. I would've given this place 5 stars because the food was absolutely delicious and the guy at the bar was GREAT when I ordered my drink.

The decor inside was very modern and nicely done.  I ordered the Gentlemen's Choice mixed drink and my husband a beer. Unfortunately my drink fell a bit flat. Just tastes like watered down whiskey. No berry flavoring what so ever.   We walked outside and fell in love with the outdoor patio! Super cool seating options. Plus the views overlooking Romare Bearden were stellar!

    "text": "I had a lot of hope for this place, as it is right across the street from my work. The menu seemed to have good options for lunch and to be reasonably priced, even if it was a bit uninspiring.   After giving them two tries for lunch, I think it's safe to say I will not be back for anything other drinks in the future.   On both trips it took 40+ minutes for our food to come after placing our order; and that's despite the restaurant being at maybe 60% capacity. The service was pretty good, but that wasn't surprising since they seem to have about 15 or so waitstaff running around. I just don't understand how it could take so long to bring out a sandwich and side for 3 people.   The food: first trip I went with what is usually a safe choice and had the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. It was easily the most monstrous chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken breast on this sucker was twice the size of the bun. Overall it was pretty good. Fries are the extra thin cut variety and a bit over cooked.   On the second trip I had the BBQ sandwich and mac and cheese for the side. After waiting 45 minutes, our plates finally arrived and two of us received fries for our side when we had all three ordered the mac and cheese. At least the server apologized and quickly brought out two additional sides of Mac and cheese. The fries and the mac were both burnt, and the mac was completely flavorless and basically inedible. The bbq sandwich had good flavor, but was so oversauced (despite coming with sauce on the side) that it fell apart the first time I picked it up, and became a knife and fork affair from the start.   I'd like to give them a better rating since the service was friendly and adequately attentive, but the kitchen staff completely ruined both experiences for me. I guess with this ownership group's track record on food at their other restaurants/bars I shouldn't have been too surprised, but that doesn't ease the disappointment. There was a lot of potential for this place with the great location. However, it looks like we're cursed with another place that has put all of its attention into maximizing their profit on the happy hour crowd at the expense of putting out even a decent product from the kitchen.",

With the help and assistance of Sarah Ikalowych, the Events Manager, the event turned out to be a huge success!! The outdoor slab high-top table was reserved for us, which was the perfect gathering area for our group.  Everyone enjoyed the wide variety of delicious appetizers...chicken quesadillas, chips and salsa, and chicken fingers with dipping sauces)..with the chicken fingers being the overall favorite.  They were delicious! We cannot thank everyone enough at Ink N Ivy for being so cooperative and accommodating. I highly suggest this venue if you are planning to host an event.",

    "text": "Went for brunch the last weekend of January and overall we were disappointed. We all had looked at the brunch menu online only to arrive and be told they no longer off that menu anymore. Fine. So we all ordered, I got the shrimp omelette and it was a complete letdown. It had 3 jumbo shrimp in it and the rest was just egg. I've had a shrimp omelette at many places and I get shrimp in every bite. My son got a kids meal grilled cheese and fries. He got his grilled cheese but by the time he got his fries he was almost done eating. Mind you he's 4 so he wasn't eating very fast. And they were cold at that. I don't exactly remember what the others in my party ordered but none of us were impressed with our meal. It was simply underwhelming. I wish I would have checked yelp prior to going but lesson learned. We did enjoy the mimosas and will go back for those but will likely leave to go have brunch somewhere else where the food is much more enjoyable.",

We visited the bar and had Dane give us great drink service despite the fact that the bar was crowded and busy. We meandered around, explored the outside seating area, and kept up with the games on the various screens (they're positioned pretty high, so they don't intrude on your good times if you aren't into sports). Such a diverse crowd in every way, which is always refreshing for me. Within the 45-minute wait time, we were seated and had menus in hand. I had crab cakes with grits and spinach - outstanding! My husband had jambalaya (served over spaghetti), and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Both of our adult sons had sandwiches (buffalo chicken and steak) with fries that disappeared before I could even try one (haha). Music was lively and loud, but it was after 11, so we expected that. Totally enjoyed the whole experience there!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place as the atmosphere and decor was so interesting. However this was the worst dining experience I ever had. We waited for 15 minutes after being seated for our server to take our drink order, drinks then took another 20 minutes to arrive. When ordering first course, my friend asked what the market price was for the chef select oysters. Our server responded with well what's your budget? This was an odd response and very unprofessional. Once she returned with the answer to his question, she said is that price okay with you (in a very condescending way). The rest of the meal was similar, everything took forever and the service was not attentive. We received our oysters and were waiting for a while for our friends' order to arrive. The manager walked by and asked how our meal was going my friend said just waiting for our oysters. The manager came back in less than 2 minutes with those oysters. They must have just been sitting in the kitchen. Once our main course finally arrived my order was wrong. There was chicken instead of shrimp. The server apologized and asked if I wanted to keep the chicken salad to take home. I told her no thanks I do not eat chicken. She came back with the blackened \"shrimp\" salad. The kitchen took the chicken off the salad, put shrimp on there and served me the same salad. I know this because they forgot a piece of chicken. Food should never be brought back into the kitchen and served again. This is a violation of food safety. The manager then comped us a dessert because of this HUGE mess up. We waited around 25 minutes to get a frozen coffee cake. After we got the bill, the server came by with another server who was very unprofessional and said how was your meal? We said eh (what else were we supposed to say at this point). Trying to say something positive, we said we really liked the atmosphere. The other server was like what about your server wasn't she great. This was completely unprofessional, and given the circumstances it felt harassing. Not only was the server not attentive throughout the meal (ordering more drinks, refills of water), the food took forever, my order was wrong and then served the same salad instead of a new one.   This is inexcusable regardless of how long its been open.",

She took our order, the food came quick and she brought us a refill. She never came back to our table. Why???? Because she and 3 other staff members just stood at the drink station and talked and laughed. When I finally got her attention after several tries she finished her conversation and came over to see what we needed. I gave her a bit of advice....MAKE YOUR MONEY!!! I was not impressed with the food and terribly disappointed by the lack of service. To have a restaurant in a prime location does not give a pass for giving good service. The crowd was ok, the price was average, the music was ok, the food was ok. If the service was better, I'd go back. With the service being as bad as it was I don't think I'll be going back.....",

I've been here a couple of times  from their opening week until now and after a couple of visits, I am definitely now set on my review. Pros: music is good (great ambience if you like a lively crowd with good top hits), they have nfl ticket, great modern decor n outdoor area. Cons: Their food is mediocre and overpriced... I've ordered several times and they have  gotten my order wrong multiple times. The food runners don't seem to know where they are going with their food, often running around dropping plates off at the wrong tables ( I've had to send back my food back twice), servers appear to not be well trained as they kept forgetting to ask certain questions during food orders and forgot to place several drink orders, my food came out cold, I've also had drinks charged at a different price than was in the menu, and after all this trouble during my last visit we didn't have any management come and address us or take anything off our check. I've been a server for 7 years and understand that new restaurants have to work out their kinks, however after several weeks this restaurant still needs to work on quality of food and training their servers and food runproperly.  Overall ordering food here is more of a pain then it is pleasurable.... Come here for drinks at most!",

    "text": "First impression. There was a hostess texting on her phone and made us wait while she finished her obviously important texting before she made an effort to seat us. We asked for a table on the patio and she said it would be a twenty minute wait. While we were deciding whether or not we were willing to wait, another hostess walked up and asked if we were being helped and was able to seat us ( at one of the many empty patio tables) immediately... lol.  The patio was awesome. Overlooks the park. Beautiful night. Folks had their dogs and a mixed, friendly crowd are the positives. Lots of tvs on to the college football games and it was nice to watch the christmas village going on in the park. Waitress was adorable and obviously trying very hard, but managed to get all three rounds of drink orders wrong. We felt so bad for her that we all just drank what she brought and made it work. Lol again.  Now for the food. Onion soup was almost unedible. Flavorless with burnt cheese on top. Chicken sandwich ok. Blackened shrimp salad very mediocre. Mussels with a curry sauce was cold with stale bread for dunking, like 5 day old stale tasteless white bread, couldn't even attempt to use it to soak up the mussel broth if it WAS warm. Lol again.  So my advice would be to treat this place as a bar, not as an option for dinner, and don't be picky about your drink order. We spent $150 on pretty bad food and the wrong drinks but the patio and atmoshere was enjoyable. Not sure how far location will take this place, but I hope they'll pull the food up to par and they make it because it could be a great asset to the area.",

The experience was so bad it would take days to explain. The only good thing that came out of the two hour debacle was that the manager ended up at least reducing our overall bill.   Honestly when your server disappears for so long that you have to go to the bar to order a drink and ask the hostess if she clocked out and didn't tell anyone because she was literally nowhere to be seen that is not a good sign. The other people in our group said they have experienced this bad service each time they have been there. I heard they are opening in Charleston.  Perhaps they should fix what they have before trying to expand any further.",

Our waitress, Paige, dropped off our food and we didn't see her again until we were finished with our meal and were ready to pay. The food was just okay. I ordered the steamed shrimp and my other got the pork belly mac and greens. Nothing special about either plate. There is a DJ playing decent music and the cramped bathrooms have attendants.

    "text": "Ink N Ivy used to be our go to lunch spot. We loved sitting out on the patio during warmer weather and the food was great. The service was always terrible...but it I thought of the service like you think of an ex. You're not on good terms, but what they got going on looks good, and you think that they've changed and it's going to be different.  Spoiler alert: It never is.  The location is great for warmer weather. The patio is perfect to hang out and drink at.There is a big banking scene after work, and before Knights Baseball games.  The lunch specials were great and had a lot of options.Also, they had gigantic mozzarella cheese sticks that were unreal.  So since it's been colder we haven't been over to Ink N Ivy, but we decided to give it a try. We were shocked to find out not only did they remove those cheesy pillows of heaven, but the menu removed all of our favorites. It now sways towards the vegetarian side. So, for the meatless lovers out there, I feel like the miso cauliflower, cauliflower sandwich, or multiple Brussels sprouts options will be your jam.   However, not impressed with the lack of creativity or options in the lunch menu. Out of 7 avid lovers of Ink N Ivy, 3 of us ordered the fried chicken, while 4 of us ordered the burger. I think that speaks for itself.  I hate to be negative an entire review so I am going to give some positives: The squash fritters were delicious. They were softer than I expected, and had a delicious cheesy and onion flavor.  Service was...wait for it...great! Our server was very apologetic on the menu change and offered great modifications to the menu items based on what we wanted. He was very attentive.  Hopefully the menu can change to accommodate some old favorites into the new vegetarian focused menu.",

I entered this establishment the other day around 8pm, sat down and was handed a menu by the hostess. My friends and I proceeded to sit there waiting, and waiting, and waiting...for 15 minutes. We asked a passing server to kindly send our server to our table to take our order. By this time, we were all ready to order. We sat there for another 2-3 minutes with no contact from our server.   At this point, I'm done; you lost my business. If this is how the staff performs here, please retrain them. That kind of service is unacceptable.",

When we walked in we were told the wait would be very long, but then the manager saw our large group and leaped into action - accommodating us on the patio with a massive collection of tables. It was greatly appreciated and a very pleasant surprise/first impression.  Our group was taken care of all evening - the drinks were flowing, the food was good and nobody had an incorrect order. Impressive!  My only complain would be with the dish I ordered - the crabcakes. They were very runny/smooshy for crabcakes. I expected a bit of a crisper crust on the top and bottom and more of a solid/flakey consistency from the crab. This felt more like a soup ball? Either way, it tasted fairly good.  I'm a much bigger fan of this Charlotte location than I am the Charleston one. I'd visit again if in town for work - especially for the cocktails!",

The chicken and waffles were ok. The salmon Benedict was not the best. It was supposed to come with glazed salmon. It was dry and the poached eggs were cooked all the way through. All of our food needed a generous amount of salt.  Chad was helpful and tried to make up for our table's complaints.",

We had a roped off area outside, food, and plenty of staff dedicated to helping just us. The staff were attentive and quick. The food was surprisingly delicious!! They had AWESOME chunky guacamole, which I was not expecting. We also had meatballs (packed with flavor and moist), sliders, and caprese salad skewers (fresh and delicious). I was super impressed with the food.  The space is decorated in black, green, and purple so the decor is bolder than most Charlotte bars. The music gets louder as the afternoon and evening goes on. Our event ended at 7, but many of us stuck around after the event, and the place was packed by 9. The crowd seemed to mostly be drinking, but we did see some guests eating inside.   Ink N Ivy is not really my scene, so I don't think this is a place I'll frequent, but I did really enjoy spending and afternoon on their patio. Their waitstaff were great and they were well suited to handle our large group effortlessly.",

We ordered a second mimosa and it never came.  Before we asked for the bill she told us that they ran out of champagne, and once we got the bill; she then said she would take the drink off the bill (of course because we never received it) She rarely came by to check on us, and she NEVER refilled our waters. The menu was not up to date with their current prices, the $2 listed mimosa for the weekend was actually $3 or $4, which is fine, but the correct information should be listed.   We had such high hopes for this spot, but we were pretty let down, a server can make or break the experience. Good luck.",

We were seated in the section of the best waitress I've encountered! She was bubbly, sweet and awesome! (Hate I can't remember her name ). I ordered the salmon BLT with the au gratin potatoes. The salmon was grilled to perfection. I didn't taste any added seasoning to the filet, other than the light char from the grill. The bacon....mmmmm, bacon  added smokiness to bring up the flavor.  The toasted bun and garnishments made it a total package.  Potatoes and cheese are always a win with me! My friend ended up eating half of my side (and she ONLY wanted a taste...smh).",

They have two bars, in door and out door seating, and plenty of tvs to view NFL or what ever you enjoy viewing at the bar.   So Saturday night me and my friend visited this place, it was super packed, so very good following after opening just days ago, and they had Titos vodka on special for $5, (my favorite vodka). The bar tenders was very friendly. But the delivery of the drinks were a little slow maybe due to the amount of people.   For food I ordered the Tuna Poke appetizer it was delicious and fun to eat.   I would return this Sunday for NFL viewing, and to keep warm while tailgating.   It's a must try in Uptown Charlotte!",

The staff is friendly and attentive. As of this review, it's the new place to be \"scene\" in Uptown. Many Panthers players hangout here (for whatever that's worth). Fri & Sat the place is wall 2 wall packed (obvi) but not so much where you can't maneuver. The patio is my favorite aspect of this place! Spacious, modern, and colorful. The patio overlooks Romare Bearden park. Although feel free to go casual, I've noticed most people are semi dressed up, just sayin!",

We agreed to just be sat at that point. We sat down in a corner table outside when another server came to try to give us water when the manager stopped her to say she can't serve us. I went back in to say that we could sit inside if necessary, where I overheard the manager and hostess saying we were being \"picky\" about our seating. At that point we felt as though we were an inconvenience and we'd get adequate service at another institution that would like our business.",

During the week; the drinks are amazing (a little pricey) but are equal parts unique and delicious. The food is okay, not as good as I was expecting but I didn't completely hate it. I had the \"sweet Thai chili\" sauce on my first visit and was obsessed.   Brunch however, was not the best. Myself and my friends love brunch. Half price mimosas and new food is our favorite. But I'd say out of 100& enjoying the food, we maybe 60% really loved it. I had a lunch item (Steak sandwich) and it was okay. They had the Chicken and waffles and WHY DO YOU PUT A BONE IN CHICKEN NEXT TO A STACK OF WAFFLES. I understand food art but I mean really why. The sausage/maple gravy sauce was boss though. Also, cool bloody mary bar.  All in all, It's a great spot to hang outside with friends. They have great seating, cool chairs and insta-worthy spots everywhere.   I won't be going back for the food, just those 2 dollar mimosas and the views.",

The pork is lightly smoked but full of flavor. Service was excellent and can I now please talk about the decor because I would like to just bathe in all of it. The wood walls with chandeliers and pugs in tutus on the ceilings and nanaste elephants tattooed with traditional tattoo and meatballs sculptures--- ah it makes my stimulus so happy :) I also hear how it becomes a night club and I can see that, DJ even there on a Sunday afternoon.

I can picture it becoming a tourist spot, busy before and after sporting events but I don't see the Uptown crowd embracing Ink N Ivy for too long.  I went with a few girlfriends for lunch as a party of three. Our server was attentive and was able to answer our questions. Everything moved pretty smoothly and we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time for a weekday lunch.  The food is okay. Seems like glorified, overpriced bar food. There's nothing special about it that sets it apart from any other casual spot. I ordered the Thai Mussels (more spice than flavor) and we three ladies split the Classic Nachos with Pulled Pork. My bill came to $20 and I was still hungry by the time I got back to the office.  I'm clearly not the target market for Ink N Ivy.

We went here last Tuesday and we are still waiting on our food. Our server was MIA for 45 minute increments. We managed to get our appetizers 50 minutes after we ordered them. The nachos were good, so congrats to them on that, I guess. Overall we were less than impressed and have ZERO intentions of going back.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying our waitress Mandi was absolutely awesome and I give her 5+ stars!  She was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I absolutely love the atmosphere here as well. Awesome booths, awesome decor and cool bar area. I had a cup of tomato bisque for an appetizer. The flavor was very good but it had more the consistency of a salsa or marinara. Pretty chunky for a soup but flavor was good.  I also had the mussels and they were very good but the bread that came with them was not very good. Extremely crunchy and kind of crumbled into dust as I ate it. Good bread is a must for the mussels dish to sop up all of the amazing sauce! I also had one of their signature drinks which was delicious but strangely tasted (and felt) like it had no alcohol in it....weird???....but still delicious.  The main reason I give only 3 stars is the bread and the host staff. When I got there, there were about 4 young people standing at the hostess station having a great conversation but didn't seem to notice, or care that I had walked in (OK, I'm no Jennifer Lopez so I guess I can't blame them LOL!). Luckily I spotted my friends and proceeded to our table. But when our party of 3 left, still there were at least 4 people at the front door host station but no acknowledgement whatsoever, or \"thank you\" for coming in....oblivious.  I will definitely try this place again as it has a great vibe and atmosphere.",

So we called for reservations but they don't take them. We got there and they seated us within 10 min. However we waited about 45 min after ordering our food. Everyone enjoyed the taste of their choices: burgers, chicken pot pie daily special, BBQ, salmon salad, chicken wrap, etc. Only issue was our chicken pot pie special was barely warm. Waitress was fine, but then got flustered with our concerns. Then Andrew the manager checked in on us and he was awesome. He truly wanted to understand what happened and make it better. The place is still new with growing pains. Food great, decor awesome. We will be back.",

Ceiling decor was second to none.    I had a great time, but mom and dad's experience was just okay.  Mom got a burger, but the bottom bun was soggy and it ruined the burger experience.  The mac and cheese side was uninspiring.  It seems like they take cooked shells and then just add a sauce on top of it.  The sauce is too liquidy to stick to the pasta, so you have to spoon the cheese sauce onto the pasta to get a good bite.  Dad got a buffalo chicken sandwich, but I heard him say that it was heavy on the breading and light on the chicken and spent too much time in the fryer.    Mom said that when everything clicks here, Ink n Ivy is a solid 4.5 stars, but they consistently can't deliver the full package.    Oh well, at least I got a great nap!",

I had high hopes for my sister's birthday because I had heard some good things of other locations. However, we couldn't have made a worse choice. Not only is their service staff incredibly unprofessional, their \"security\", or glorified bums, escorted a heavily intoxicated woman out of the establishment, and physically threw her to the street without anyone to help take care of her. The same security watched the girl, for the better part of 20 mins, get surrounded by a bunch of drunk pigs, and even encouraged them (group of 4 white men) to take the intoxicated girl with them in their SUV!!! Whereas I realize it is not the responsibility of the business to inhibit bad decisions, there is a difference between that and promoting a rape-culture. The same security guards stared down all of my 4 sister's as we left, as if they were unclothing them with their eyes while smiling about it. Having read some other reviews about their security... It gives proof that their management is not doing ANYTHING to prevent this type of behavior from taking place.   This is a TRASH business, ran by scumbags! There is no excuse for this behavior. Their management should be ashamed of themselves. If you support any Ink + Ivy, you are indirectly promoting behavior like this and should truly reconsider your life.",

There were so many open tables at Ink N Ivy I was floored because the service was impeccable, the food was phenomenal, and the drinks were spot on.   I made a reservation, thinking this place would be swamped, but I still suggest the reservation - it's never bad to have. Because it was February we didn't sit outside, but next time I'm at Ink N Ivy I will absolutely be partaking in the patio seating!

They all pretty much start off a $9 it's about $4-$7 to add a protein. All the salads are pretty interesting too! The kale salad comes with garlic-herb vinaigrette, white beans, feta cheese, piquillo peppers, pumpkin seeds -- it was good! The ivy house salad had balsamic vinaigrette, apple, goat cheese, sunflower seeds, chick peas -- again really fresh and tasty.  I will definitely be back for the salad!  4/16 came back for some cocktails tonight. They have $8 double titos and sodas on Monday!!",

I haven't been a fan of their food in the past but they have completely overhauled their menu. I ordered the grilled salmon wrap and it was delicious.   overall cool vibe and great if your looking for fun atmosphere, good music, and great drinks! This place has one of the best views of uptown Charlotte and it's a short walk to the Romare Bearden Park and the BB&T Baseball stadium.  If you have out-of-town guests visiting Charlotte, take them here.",

I'd recommend Ink N Ivy as a start out place because it can get too rowdy at night.   Also, I previously went there for lunch during one of my first meals in the city. I didn't know any better than to have lunch there. Not many people do that and now I can see why. It's a little over priced and the food isn't that good. However, the view outside is still very nice during lunch. I got the pasta there and it was very average. It seemed like it was frozen before and just heated it up.   Overall, a good place to check out for night time outing.",

We decided to get a table since we wanted to order some food. Their menu includes nachos, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, tacos, etc. I decided to go with the blackened fish tacos and my friend got the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were pretty good but not something we would want to come back and get again. To drink, I went with the Bloody Mary bar. Since it was almost 3pm, there wasn't really much left for me to make my Bloody Mary with. No lemons, no limes, no old bay, no pickles, no worcestershire sauce, and no horseradish. I'm sure I could of went up to the bar and asked for it, but decided to just work with what was there. My friend ordered a double mimosa and our other friends just got vodka & sodas and coronas. Overall, it was an okay experience. I think I enjoyed it more the first time I went there but will maybe try again for brunch.",

I am staying off of Tryon so I was going to be brave and take the train into Uptown to meet my favorite boss for cocktails as she  knew what NEGRONI WEEK meant to me back home. It was a week filled with a craft cocktail called a Negroni. It's a simple cocktail made with 1oz sweet red Vermouth, 1oz Gin and 1oz Campri but what makes the week great is local bars take some if the proceeds and give them to local animal shelters or rescues for kittens and puppies. Even though it maynit be the same here I could still have a cocktail that I love.   We walked into Ink N Ivy and it was packed. A nice young man and lady were waiting on us and we ordered two waters with lemon and two Negroni's. Well we got two waters from two totally different young men wirh no lemon. We asked for lemon 3 times. The young man and lady came back and asked foe our drink order again and you can tell they had no idea what the drink was and asked us how to spell it. We not only spelled it but I showed them a picture on my phone. But what we got was Vodka and cranberry juice garnished with lime.   They had three bartenders behind the bar and not a one of them looked up the recipe at all. After waiting on the wrong drink and lemon for water we left without my beloved NEGRONI. That was Wednesday of last week. I know you are asking why did it take me this long to write a review. Well on our way out we spoke to the manager Jim about our experience and he gave us his card and told us that if we emailed him which I did that he would learn about the cocktail and reach back out to have us back. It's Sunday and I still haven't heard from him.   Sadly...I DID NOT ENJOY MY INK AND IVY experience and sadly I won't be back...",

Update:  To be fair, I did not give the establishment the ability to correct by bringing it to their attention. But...  multiple people were in the process of cooking and delivering the meal and were either uninterested or un empowered to send back if this was not the usual quality of the wings. But \"Everything\" was off including what tasted like ranch with blue cheese crumbled in it.  I was going to ask for the blue cheese that I ordered until I hit the crumbles. It was my first time there and from out of town.  Seems like a great place and could have other items that are of quality.",

The service was ok and I liked the spin on the mozzarella stick.  I also enjoyed one of their cocktails.   My rating of a two is because during the lunch hour there were these flashing lights in the restaurant.  Totally distracting and if I had a vertigo issue I would need to leave.  The lights also flickered throughout the dining area a few times.  This may just be due to construction in the area.  Either way it was annoying.",

Loving the atmosphere here, it's always that great contagious energy and the food drink list is on point.  Pros Raw Bar - check  Tapas variety - check Crafty, out of the box cocktails - check Near high end spirits that make you happy - check Music - check Beautiful staff - check  Comfy patio for people watching - check Restaurant gutsy enough to change gears on the late and bring out that lounge feel with a valet dude, black rope & bouncer - check  Swaky sexy cool - double check  But chill enough to watch tv on any angle or view point - hell yes!  Food must try - the spicy fried oysters, fried cheese and smoked quesadilla as tapas. Also the salmon was so big & juicy well seasoned and perfectly cooked.   Brunch - needs improvement Seems consistent with reviews, a week ago I went for brunch and the grits were disappointing. Also seemed like brunch staff didn't have a good system as 4 waiters asked is \"this your order\". It was kinda funny but presented as a potential improvement also because it was early, 11:30am. Overall I expected a better menu, it's pretty short on options, I will stick to lunch & dinner.   Drinks - make your way thru the menu, you can commit to that if you made is this far down my review",

We been sitting there for about an hour and fifteen mins, we noticed people coming In WAY after us and getting their table. I decided to ask the hostess on our wait time status and she could not even find my name on the wait list, she said someone must have deleted it. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU GO THERE AND THEY PUT YOU ON THE WAIT LIST PLEASE CHECK ON YOUR STATUS AFTER 15 MINS OF WAITING!! Seems that we was not the only people who name got \"accidentally\" deleted . The waiter came to our table 3 time ( NO LIE ), that was to get our order and drinks (because we was waiting so long we already knew what we wanted to order), bring us the food and gave us the check . I had the maple salmon with mac & cheese and green beans. My salmon and mac & cheese was over cooked and the green bean was under cooked. My 1st time there around that time was just not good.

I came here after working a 12 hours shift so I was pretty exhausted and accidentally mispronounced something (because I was so tired) and he was like \"oh maybe you need water not a drink\" in a very rude way, not a funny 'haha' way.  My friends and I all looked at each other in disbelief.  Then he comes back with our drinks and their drinks and theirs are fulls and he gives me mine with it less than 2/3 full and my friends and I were in disbelief again. So my friend and I went up to the bartender and showed her what he gave me and she was like \"so? What do you want me to do?  Remake it?\"  We said yeah because who knew what happened to the rest of my drink or what he did to it.  Then she went on to explain how we're wasting the bars money and kept saying things to make us feel bad. It was so weird. Their atmosphere is really cool though and their food is really good.  Their chicken tenders are some of my favorite, along with their honey mustard.  I'm not a huge fan of their mixed drinks though.  I hope they get new staff soon!",

The manager offered to bring us something to munch on like fries. I completely understand the gesture, but no, I want the food I ordered. That may make me sound like a jerk, but when you spend $100 on food, you kinda wanna eat that food in a timely manner.   The food itself was a 3/5. Not enough actual food but what was there was good enough.",

    "text": "Came here around 11:45 on Sunday for brunch. (This is the only reason the review isn't 5 stars) We asked to sit outside considering it was 75 degrees and there were tables open. The hosts said there would be an hour wait for outside seating, so we sat at the bar. The group who was directly behind us was told it would be an hour wait for outside as well, but as we sat at the bar we saw them being seated outside... not sure how an hour wait went by in only 5 minutes. Kind of irritated, we asked the bartender if we could be seated outside, and we were immediately. Hmm, interesting.  At noon, we ordered mimosas which were fantastic - $2 for the champagne pour, and $4 for the wine pour. I ordered the chicken and waffles which were pretty good. The chicken was a bit over cooked but was still delicious.   The atmosphere was great. Outside seating was the place to be with views of the park and all of the buildings uptown. They had a DJ playing house music (which some people on yelp didn't seem to like, but we did) which reminded us of some spots in DC. Our waitress was awesome and admitted that she was pretty swamped with tables, however still gave us the full rundown on specials and what not.   Being newcomers to Charlotte we weren't sure what to expect, but after this we'll definitely be back for brunch on our next visit.",

She felt although the pretty young ladies could pull them off, some of the skin shown was a tad gratuitous. We scoped our bartender pulling her shorts out of her behind a few times. Some of the shorts were shorter than others, and my wife felt the waitress wearing the normal shorts looked pretty and and sexy. I on the other hand saw nothing  Drinks were good. Our happy hour bill came out to $27 for 2 drinks and 2 beers. Damn this town is getting expensive. Not sure if we'll go back because there are so many options uptown.",

    "text": "For what Ink N Ivy is, its a good bar off the ballpark. Not exactly my scene, but for the location and some drinks outside, it works. There is a large indoor space that has basically a front and a back. The back is more for dancing/late night drinks, where the front is more for sitting in a booth and a little quieter. The outdoor patio offers a mix of both worlds, but the con of this is you hear two different types of music (the back and the front don't play the same tunes). However, the outdoor space is great to sit back with friends and enjoy a nice drink (or food). One pro, I typically only drink wine which is very hard to find at bars like this. Their wine was actually pretty decent!",

Our waitress was the sweetest and most accommodating server, and I wish I could remember her name!  I hate to give low ratings, but this place gets more hype than necessary, in my opinion. The worst part is how loud the music is during normal dining hours. The inside is really cool and HUGE, but the music is at club volume, so having a conversation or even trying to enjoy your meal with music blaring is not enjoyable. Also since it has the \"club\" atmosphere, there was a group of girls that were causing a scene and were clearly wasted grinding on whatever was moving which I don't need to see when eating. One guy was getting kicked out because he was so intoxicated. Both of those situations just made it an uncomfortable dining experience at 8 pm. The food wasn't bad, but not memorable either.  Now if I were looking for somewhere to party, or a cool patio to hang out on, I might come here. The patio has a nice view of Romare Bearden Park and the Knights Stadium. Overall, not my first choice, but I'd give it a second chance for a night out.",

    "text": "I am visiting Charlotte and the front desk clerk of my hotel suggested this restaurant. I started my meal with the fresh chopped salad, and it was chilled and delicious (just as it should be).   I followed that with the Salmon Entree, and it was cooked to perfection, and full of flavor.  I caved to my sweet tooth (I know, I started out so well) and for the Red Velvet wedge!  It was a huge slice, but oh, so, good! (no I didn't finish it all).  My waitress Chelsea was fantastic and was very attentive, polite, and timely.    I will say that if you are ever in Charlotte and want great food, you should check this place out!  It's a must.",

    "text": "Cool decor, great service, lousy wings, and the most expensive drink I never had!  Dude...I left my...$21..top shelf..Strong Island beverage on the table...in error.....I can hardly talk about it. Ouch! Ohhhh the pain! (dramatic fake cry fed by real emotions)  I ordered a top shelf Long Island iced tea, which I lovingly refer to as a Strong Island. The 1st one I received tasted very weak so I returned it and had it made again. The second one was a wee bit better, but still weak and I just figured, hell, I'll get another if necessary.   Baaaaaybeh...I got that check and it said $21 for the beverage. First, I attempted to clear what must have been good morning crust and dyslexia from my eyes, it didn't work. I nearly had a heart attack. Never in my hungry and thirsty life have I ever spent $21 on a single beverage. Why? Because..WHY!? That is a WHOLE BOTTLE from the ABC store! That's why. Because that is 2-3 bottles of wine from Harris Teeter! That's why!  Worst of all was when I took a potty break. I came back to the table, packed my belongings and did a photo shoot at the front of the restaurant, with the ladies at my table, as my golden chalice of a drink was left alone to condensate and become more watered down, plummeting into a fast descent to the over iced underworld where drinks go to die. Basically I forgot my drink on the table and never finished it.  Luckily, I'm not bitter at all.   Chicken wings-were a 1 out of 5. The sauce was not spicy at all and it was kind of loose opposed to being thick and clinging to the wings. Also, the wings had a lot a chewy fat on them which is always scary.   Caesar salad- nothing special, weird aftertaste.  Our server and the manager were great to talk too. They get a 5 out of 5.  That is all.",

    "text": "Avaerage at best. The atmosphere and design of this place is very nice. Really open space with a great patio area and DJ that plays decent party mix music. Honestly the music wasn't what I listen to but hey it might work for you.   So just to put it out there, they do not take reservations unless you have a party of 20 or more so be prepared for that. Me and a few friends came for brunch on Sunday. They do not have a bottomless mimosa option, however, they do regular mimosas for $3 and double mimosas for $6. If you want to buy a bottle of prosecco/champagne it's 15$. I sat at the bar waiting for my friends so I had a couple mimosas and the bartenders were very nice. Once my friends came we got a table on the patio.  Great view of the city on the patio. Anyways. We got our mimosas and it kinda went downhill from there lol. Everything just took a really long time. People who ordered appetizers took awhile and it took awhile for food. It honestly took a minute for mimosas as well. When we got our food, not everyone at the table had their food at the same time so I felt bad for them.  Majority of the table ordered the salmon Bennie which the \"POACHED\" egg had no yolk running out of it. Clearly we asked for a hard boiled egg because that's how it came out. Personally I ordered a fried egg cooked medium so I had a little yolk..or so I thought. My egg was hard boiled too. The flavors were good but the seasoning wasn't consistent. I had the potatoes and some were well seasoned and some tasted like plain potato.  Idk if it's because they were busy that everything took long and food came out eh...ok but it was a disappointment. Maybe it's better here when it's not busy but the food is nothing to brag about.",

    "text": "So we stopped at Ink and Ivy to grab a bite to eat after a class, we were looking for somewhere we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful evening.  My friend had been to Ink and Ivy before for drinks and wanted to try their food.  We were greeted by the hostess stand and told that the patio was full and that we could go to the outside bar, but they only had a partial menu.... No offer to wait for a table in the patio.  We chose to go ahead and sit at the outside (covered patio) bar.  It wasn't crowded and we were greeted by the bartenders. We sat at the end of a long hightop as the other tables were further back in the bar area with poor lighting and not much of an outdoor view.  The bartender gave us the bar menu and asked if we would like some waters, we replied yes (it would be another 30 minutes, after our food came out before we got our waters.....with lime because they didn't have any lemons).  I decided to order a Moscow mule since Tito's was on special...... When it was finally delivered we were informed they didn't have any copper mule glasses because they all got stolen during St. Patrick's day (ummm that was 6 weeks ago).  We saw the bartender hand another customer a full menu and asked if we could order off that menu (since we had wanted to sit on the patio)... He got us the full menu to order off of (since it wasn't busy). I ordered a fried chicken sandwich with herb potatoes as a side.  Everything looked great until I took my first bite of sandwich and bit into dark gray/brown meat..... Not even sure it was chicken.  At that point I was don't with my chicken sandwich and chose to eat only the potatoes...which were good but not great.  My friend said her food was ok but she probably wouldn't come back for the food.        In short..... Nice patio and bar area, service was fine, but a little slow considering the lack of bar customers. I wouldn't recommend eating here...just come for the bar if you want a outdoor place to eat.",

    "text": "The service was THE WORST service EVER in LIFE! We have NEVER experienced such unethical behavior ever!   Last Saturday, from the moment we walked in to celebrate our friends' birthdays, (who both came in from out of town) the host Alvin told us it was an hour wait. It took 2 hours. We requested to be seated outside. When our table was ready, we hurried to pay for our appetizers at the bar, two women sat down at our table. When we told the host, you'd think he'd ask them to move. But he didn't. What was the point of having a pager if it's first come, first serve? We were seated inside. (Not as requested)   He told us he'd comp our deserts as an apology. So we ordered desert. Eric, our waiter was unaware of the situation so he grabbed his manager Myles Colbert.   Myles, was extremely disrespectful, rude and treated us like we wanted freebies. (If we did, we wouldn't have paid for our drinks and dinner.)  Myles was unapologetic about how we were treated and told us the poor experience is normal. He also kept saying, \"I'm not comping you the desert!\"   Honestly, it wasn't about the bland deserts, it was about your host recognizing what he did was wrong and wanted to make up for it. As a manager, the professional thing to do is honor your employee's word. It's not our fault that he had no authority to do so. We find it unfair how Myles belittled Alvin and called us liars. He even insists we write a bad review on the business. His exact words were, \"let me give you my business card\".  He LITERALLY threw the card at me.   The waiter Eric felt so bad for us and tried to pay for our deserts himself. Thank God there's still good humans out there with feelings.   The food and drinks were okay, so don't expect too much if you decide to experience it for yourself. Expect to walk in there and get treated like a number. Then you'll be fine.   Service as you can see was horrible. They're just so busy that they don't care. Once another trending spot opens up, they'll start to care. Since they're new in town they feel like it doesn't matter who returns and who doesn't.  I've been a business owner for 18 years and the success of my career wouldn't exist if it weren't for my loyal clients. Retention is everything. Makes me wonder if Tom and Tyler knows how their business is operated while they're not around. I did reach out to Tyler. Hope he puts an end to it.",

The waitress didn't even come to check on us and we had to constantly wave down any other waitress around us. As we were all ready for our checks we had to wait even longer and some of the receipts were wrong so we had to wait for her to go back and change it which took a while. I suggest to not go here for food but for the drinks which were good and the only thing they didn't take forever to bring. Overall I will never come back here for food.",

After reviewing their preverbial \"report card\" I read that they were \"dinged\" for common sense things like improper hand washing and chefs not properly covering their hair and beards and also leaving their personal car keys and belongings near food prep areas. I wish I could say this is small stuff, but this is often times how norovirus and other food contaminated illnesses spread. Soooo chew on that for a moment.  As for the look and feel of the establishment. I will echo what many others have said...it's trendy, young and in my personal experience...all three times that I have been here the wait staff has been courteous, maybe not prompt.... but courteous. Anytime after 9 PM on weekends gets a little loud and has the feel of a club. There's even a velvet rope outside with a line waiting to get in. Music is loud, crowd is young...food is suspect. Oh yeah and  the last few times I was there, they ran outta simple, yet key ingredients to make the most basic cocktails. I wouldn't say not to go, since everyone talks about this place, but I also say don't have high expectations.

    "text": "I came to Ink and Ivy for Wine Down Wednesday's. The first experience was pleasant. The wine was wonderful and the price made it even better. I also ordered the Salmon Sandwich and it was delicious. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly. As my friends and I were leaving it started to rain really hard so we decided to stay and get more drinks. The 2nd experience started off not so good. The host and a server acknowledged that there was some tables available but was told us a 20 min wait would be needed. So my friends and I proceeded to the bar to wait. Immediately after walking away from the front and placing an order for drinks, our table was ready. We sat in the corner near the front windows and it was very hot! There was flies flying around and I wasn't a fan. I decided to order a dessert and ordered the cheesecake. I was brought a key lime pie. I made the server aware and she brought me back a cheesecake. This was not a homemade cheesecake. Definitely tasted like a frozen cheesecake from the grocery store. I won't be getting dessert here again.",

I have been multiple times for lunch and I do enjoy their fried chicken special on Mondays (when it is not over done) and their shrimp and grits on Wednesday is also quite good. They add in peppers which is lovely. They are pretty creative with their drink specials as well, which I can appreciate.   I have only been here once after hours for drinks and to socialize. We enjoyed it but the service was not great, they brought the wrong wine, and it took a while for them to get us our appetizers. When I let the waitress know that the wine was incorrect she huffed and puffed as if it were my fault she brought the wrong type of wine, which was frustrating.   The ambiance is neat and I appreciate the decor. Overall, not my top choice to go to for a bar scene, it is pricey and the service is spotty but for a quick lunch it is a good spot.",

I had heard very good things about Ink N Ivy but noticed the overall 3 star rating on yelp and admittedly I had some reservations about it after reading some reviews. After having such a great experience I decided to take a poll from the other 3 people I was with and they all rated the meal a 5. I gave it a 4 but am going with the majority!   The place is casual with a classy side and has a menu that suits all occasions.  Thw service was fast and the staff very friendky. Food was high quality and fresh. I will return and will definitely recommend to others!",

I ordered dinner, was served a buffalo chicken sandwich instead of what I ordered.  I make it a point to not send food back, but I had to. I come to nc once a month for business and need to eat.  In the next 5 mins I was served a fruit punch water instead of the knob creek Manhattan I ordered.  Then my new order of food immediately came out.  I took one bite- wow raw chicken!  Not fully cooked, salmonella raw chicken.  At this point I was embarrassed for giving this place a second chance and getting burned on my drink and 2nd round of their attempt at food.  I spoke with a manager and he wanted to get me another drink to smooth this over.  No way, third try already burned from a terrible drink and 2 terrible attempts at food.  Not his fault, but I'm never giving this place a try again.  If you have any respect for your body I wouldn't recommend this trash heap.  Drug test your staff or close the doors!  This place is not just giving bad service, it's risking the health of its patrons.",

The best part is the specials on the bottles of champagne but at this point I don't think it'll keep me coming back. The wait staff is ok, some of them are really nice and welcoming...others aren't. Overall I'd go back for the mimosa specials but I'm likely to eat before I go.",

After waiting a total of an hour and 20 minutes the food finally comes out- the salmon was dry and over cooked, the grits were cold, dry and hard as they'ed been waiting for an hour and 20 minutes until the salmon was cooked. The crab cakes were very small but tasted okay.   The manager apologized for the delay- sensed our frustration and comped our meal.

The atmosphere was great. I ordered the house salad and chicken quesadilla. The food was seasoned well. And the wait staff attentive. I'll definitely go back for happy hour to try their cocktails and sit on the open patio.",

We asked to speak to the manager and he was just as rude.  The chicken was so dry, our food had no flavor and the tables around us were also having issues with their food and service.  Table next to us found hair in their food.  Should I go on?",

You can literally be standing at the bar waiting to order, and the bartender will look at you, and then continue to play on his phone for 5 minutes, like they are trying NOT to care. The most unorganized clusterf I have ever seen, they literally can't even figure out their phone systems to answer the ring.  They have had a reputation for the worst service and food since they opened, and almost a year later its the exact same.",

Out of the table of nine, the only thing I heard that was decent was the burger that a couple of the guys got. I, unfortunately, picked the shrimp poboy, big mistake. Get this...upon inspection, I could tell that they took the boiled shrimp that they use for the shrimp cocktail, breaded and then fried it. So, it was basically cooked twice. The breading would come right off because of this, and the shrimp itself was tasteless and tough. A couple of other people got the smoked chicken. They were disappointed as well. Why? The chicken had absolutely NO smoked flavor. Other than that, our waitress was great.",

We ordered fritters for an app and 2 salads for dinner, all of which were amazing. We were confused on arrival because the restaurant is in the process of updating their menu. This new temporary menu seemed to be a bit limited and didn't contain any of our go-to dishes. About 1/2 way through our meal, Jim the General Manager, sat down to ask us how our meal was. We explained the food was great...but what's up with the new menu?! He told us that they had surveyed many of their guests and paid attention to their yelp reviews, and found their old menu was too lengthy and confusing. He then asked us what app we had ordered, and said \"No, you need to try the Green Mac,\" then proceeded to go get us an order so we could try it. It was amazing! Shout out to Jim and our server who was great! Also, there was another manager who helped us and she was super nice as well. Great job Ink N Ivy! We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I realize they just opened, but the service was horrible and the food was not that good either. There were 5 of us and we asked for a table on the patio. There seemed to be about 5 hostesses and none of them communicated with one another. We asked if they needed our name and we were told no, they would come and get us. We then watched as tables opened up and they sat people that came in after us. We then asked about it and another hostess told us they needed our name to put us on the wait list. We then waited 30 more minutes, were finally told there was a table... a hostess walked us to the table and as we got to it noticed another hostess had sat another party at the table. They then sat us at another table which was dirty and cleaned it as we sat there. A hostess gave us one menu and 3 place settings (for 5 of us). We then sat there for 10 minutes until I finally went in and asked for a manager.  I told the manager our experience and she said she would get a waiter right over and was sorry. A waiter did come over and we placed our drink order. 2 of our 5 drinks came 10 minutes later. We waited another 10 minutes for the other drinks.  We ordered our food and it came out at a reasonable amount of time. It was very basic.  The decor was cool and the location is great. I hope their service and food improves, because it was a sh!t show! I'm not surprised that it's the same company that owns Hot Taco... another restaurant that is a mess",

We got the smoked wings, calamari, potato skins for appetizers. For entrees we got the shrimp linguine and the goat cheese burger without the goat cheese and sub for cheddar! It's possible guys! Lol it was delicious there was bits in chorizo on top of my potatoes that gave it an extra kick. Everything was amazing! It barely fit on the table and I wish I couldve tried everything on that menu foreal. We also tried two fruity cocktails which were fantastic. They were the poison ivy and the truth serum. They were both fruity and you just can't get one. We're extremely satisfied with everything from the service to the meals. We will definitely be back and with more people!",

The environment is LOUD, And i could not have a conversation with my table. Also one of their toilets was clogged and overflowed with something nasty, and not attended to.",

The food came out pretty fast and my chicken sandwich was huge and looked great.  The chicken breast was very thick and chewy, they should probably use a thinner chicken breast.  The fries were pretty good, so just ok for me.",

The menu has recently changed from the large selection of restaurant quality small and large bites, to a slim selection of light pretentious options.

My friends and I did the RB st pattys day crawl and this bar was listed as one with specials ($4 bud light, $6 liquor).   However they were ripping people off.  I ordered a bud light and was charged $6.  And the lady was a real B when I asked why it wasn't $4 like it was supposed to be.  Then my friend ordered a whiskey and coke and was charged $8 and again got attitude when he asked why it wasn't the $6 special.  They advertise as one of the bars with the beer specials but they are defnitely not and are just stealing people's money.   First visit was for lunch and it was ok but I would never go back just for food.  Over priced and not that great.  Head across the street to Valhalla.",

Literally sitting to be addressed for the most basic of things: water, bread, utensils. Nothing!   Finally a waitress comes over and doesn't have to ask for drinks because Ive gone to the bar before she made it to me. We ordered fries, those were cold. Why the hell is there a raw bar when everyone can look over it. Gross. The Mac and Greens were good. The nachos were good. I had to ask for more cheese.

My first visit here was for drinks and dinner before the Panthers Thursday night game and arriving at 6:30pm I'm not sure what I expected but the place was extremely packed! Hey the more the merrier ! Until you want a drink from the bar and its Amazing Race challenge to get a drink. I cant blame the place for being packed, it was game night and Ink N Ivy is the newest and hottest spot downtown. The outside bar and patio was great even with the crowd. It is definitely an unofficial networking event after work hours lol. The beer, wine and cocktail menu has a great variety and the prices are pretty much the going rate as far as I can recall.  The inside dining area and bar is very nice! But crowded as well but less crowded than the bar. All of the wait staff was great! I really wish I could remember my waitor's name but he was awesome!   I heard the food was really good and was glad I could eat dinner even in the madness on the patio. We order a lot of appetizers so we could just share with everyone in our large party. The Nachos with pork was great!! They were a big hit with our group and was gone quickly! The Quasadillas with chicken were pretty good but the sauce that comes on the side was really good. I really wish I paid more attention or drank less when I was there lol The Chicken wings are great as well!! They were a big hit for our group.   Overall this is a great spot for game day, after hours or the even a dinner date before the crowd gets there. There was a DJ playing inside, I'm not sure if this is an every night thing but it was a nice touch and he wasn't overpowering with his music. Cant wait to come back  for another Panthers pregame or even dinner to try more of the menu. I heard the oysters are awesome!!",

Food - Worst was the wedge salad with steak - steak fatty and not edible, hidden under blue cheese dressing, our friend kept spitting the meat out - no one wants to eat a mouthful of fat.  Tuna tacos - bland with no toppings - raw, not seared, with tasteless cream sauce.  Steak tacos - must have been same steak as on salad.  Roasted broccoli side was not roasted and sitting in oil & water.  Turkey bacon avocado wrap small and best of 4 meals except for hardly any bacon and avocado.",

Hard for bartenders to keep up with perimeter tables.  They should have servers assigned to bar tables.  I got lucky last night & today!  I had St. Louis Ribs. Good temp, flavorful & Mac n Cheese worthwhile.  D's Lime Chicken was challenged with Pasta (not angel hair as listed and no notice of sub) & chicken at different temperatures (not warm), but good flavor.  Today for 1pm game & good brunch menu.  D again got not warm, 40-45min turn around on a pork sandwich.  So grits and sandwich not to temp but still delish.  Room for improvement but not hopeless.  The BBQ in his sandwich was better than the BBQ in my Carolina Benedict (delivered quickly and at temp). Kind of like dark, crispy vs. white, chewy.  Good flavors either way. Grits are good and hearty.  Waffle Cornbread needs sugar, but that's a regional thing.    So, still a great experience.  Patio great, servers, hostesses, managers everybody is doing their best.  Great location.  As long as service stays positive and food is at temp... Menu, flavors & vibe are enticing.  Music note... I'd like to hear different music at noon on Sunday  than I heard at 1am on Saturday Eve.",

There is a large first-come, first serve table that can accommodate a large group, and a nice-size wrap around bar to grab drinks.  The drinks are somewhat reasonably priced.  They don't have the largest selection of wine, but the one I was drinking was pretty good.  Bar wasn't packed, yet it was a bit slow.  The outside bar doesn't have a waitress, but they did look like they had a roped off section for drinks/private parties on the patio that did have waitress service.  Seems like a pretty cool place for a special event!  I think the best part about this place was the view overlooking the park.  I think this is a great spot to meet a friend for a drink after work in Uptown.  I would like to come back and try the food!",

    "text": "This place has a great atmosphere.  Awhile back they had a terrible health score.  We had avoided it  since but decided to try it when our condo complex  scheduled an event.  They've brought in a new manager to address the issues.  It appears he has some work to do.  My ice water had a piece of plastic in it, like the wrapper off the top off a bottle.  When I ordered a vodka soda and the bartender picked up a glass to mix it in, the glass was filthy and she was going to use it!  She put a wedge of lime in my husband's drink when he had requested a lemon twist and she had verbally verified his request.  I assume the health grade issue was what required that she put on latex gloves before putting the garnish in the drink. Couldn't she just have speared it with a toothpick?  The gloves were creepy. As we walked across the patio my husband stepped in gum.  I know the restaurant/bar can't be responsible for rude guests that throw gum on the floor, but it added to the ickiness of the evening and contributed to the overall sense of a complete lack of attention to details. The place was not crowded, so service should have been sharper.  I can't imagine what it must be like on a packed summer evening. In all fairness, I raised our issues with the manager and he offered to buy us drinks.  We declined, suggesting that what he needed was to better train the employees and get them to refocus on attention to detail and customer service.",

It has amazing art work on the walls and a huge outdoor patio. The food was amazing and their cocktail menu was huge and had some unique selections. I got a buffalo chicken sandwich which was bigger than my head!!! The Salmon BLT was cooked perfectly and the salads can feed 3 people. But the best thing there was the French 5 onion soup, blew my freakin mind!!! A+++ $-$$",

I expected it to be packed before a home game (and it was), but we were still able to get good, fast service at a standing table by the bar. It had an awesome vibe, especially for a football pregame, and I appreciated the lively atmosphere and plethora of panthers fans. $3 mimosas also hit the spot and are on par/better than other offers in town.  The surprise here was with the food! I expected a good atmosphere and solid drinks, but my shrimp creole omelette was innovative and delicious. The creole sauce was on point, and they did not skimp on da shrimp. Would definitely recommend checking their brunch out!!",

A couple coworkers and I are constantly on the search for lunch joints that are convenient, with decent food (we keep our expectations realistic) and timely service. After being consistently underwhelmed here, we talked ourselves back into lunch today. Food took forever, and came out cold. The server only came by once in an hour long period (the manager took our drink order and food runners brought the food). We repeatedly asked for our checks from the server AND floor manager long after we had finished our meals and they both kept saying okay, and never returning. We sat with empty glasses and plates in front of us for 45 minutes. We understand it was lunch hour rush, but every table around us had come, eaten and left within an hour, like a typical uptown lunch should be. Lunch shamefully took almost 2 hours today, with almost an hour spent waiting for our checks.  The only saving grace here is the trendy ambiance. We won't be returning.",

You don't have to wait to be seated outside, you may find a table open or you can kinda stand around and it's cool. DRINKS: avg price $10ish+ I tried the \"Truth Serum\" which was good, I stuck with those all night and every time I've went (been there 3 times now). It's a tequila drink, try it out if you like tequila! They do have some specials during the week, daily so check before you go. But the best one in my opinion is Monday - it's like $3 off specialty cocktails or something like that. FOOD: we didn't have a main meal there just some apps. We tried the quesadilla which was so good! And also their sliders. Good too. SERVICE: when there's a big crowd you may have to flag someone down. If your with a big group all on the same bill, there will only be one waitress for your whole group and you are only allowed to order with them. Which is kinda silly. Just a heads up for big groups!",

They also do not validate parking and so it cost me 12$ for an hour to park in the lot next to the restaurant. Really disappointing.",

    "text": "The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the first time I went was a pretty good experience, and the decor is cool, but then again I just had drinks...I should just do 1 1/2 star. The first time I was here, I came with a group to watch the Panthers vs. Cardinals game, we were sat right away and our server quickly came over and was very friendly. I dont think they were offically suppose to be open that day so it was a nice change to watch the game from the EpiCenter. The place became packed quickly, and we could tell, our server was hard to catch at times, but i've been a server, so no worries I know what its like when your slammed and they were only serving drinks. There was a station set up out on the patio for snack like food, but the kitchen wasnt open?!?!  The beer selection was great, enjoyed several Jam Session (my fave local brew).  That was then...flash foward to New Years Day 2017.  A group of 5 of us met for dinner, again got sat right away. Most of us orderd drinks, I decided to try the Captain Mule, figuring it was similar to the Moscow Mule, our server Chazz (yes, Chazz with 2 Z's...cue in Will Ferrell--Blades of Glory) asked me if I knew it had Captain Morgans in instead of Vodka, yes, thank you Captain Obvious! So you know the signature copper mug right? No, he brought it out in a pint glass and said \" We don't  have any copper mugs, sorry\" the glass felt like it was just out if the dishwasher and needless to say the ice melted quickly and my drink was watered down. Total fail! Thats the best part of the drink! Another girl at our tabke ordered a cocktail that had Jameson in it, which shockingly the had ran out of Jameson, so her back up drink was suppose to have a lime taste, she had to ask for limes.  When our food came out, the fries were so cold we asked for fresh fries, I had the Po' Boy, it was average. A friend of mine ordered the Chicken Ivy and barely touched it, it too was cold snd didn't taste right she said....nothing worse than bad tasting chicken. I dont think anyones food was hot like it should be, warm at best. We've all been servers and HATE complaining but we were so disappointed with this place, I highly doubt we will return, sadly not even for drinks if they cant make their signature drinks well. We had high expectations and they all failed. It was 6:30 when we met for dinner and it was so loud we felt like we were in a club and had to scream at each other to talk, our server aka Chazz the Spazz was all over the place and seemed lost at times. Maybe this place turns around. They have a long way to go. Oh, and lastly I commented on their Instagram page about this today and it was deleted...hopefully this will stay!",

    "text": "Never met such a slimy and cowardice management team. We paid $44 for two tickets to the Halloween party the bar was throwing. Come to find out, this sketchy mismanaged dump was not charging a cover fee up until 10pm. They advertised that wrist bands after 10pm would be required and anyone already inside the bar by 10pm would have to pay the $22/ticket to stay. That was absolutely False and I ended up paying the $44 for tickets (in advance) for no reason at all. When I confronted the manger at the bar to see if I could get a refund (because tickets were evidently not required), he stated \"that's the gamble you take when you pay cover at a bar.\" What???? Incredibly rude, unprofessional and deceitful. Will NEVER go back to ink and Ivy.",

Saturday, Dec 10 walked and asked for a table for two with estimated 15 min wait, no problem. Got a drink at the bar but 45 min later still no text regarding our table. Spoke to one of the many inefficacious hostess there and clearly they forgot to text us instead of an apology they said we were just about to call you about open seats at the raw bar(they had been open the whole time) after refusing they said then it will be a 45 min wait so that would have been a total of an 1 hr 30 waiT. Clearly we left. Poor customer service and lack of basic apology for clearly an error on there part. Plenty of other uptown restaurants to patron.",
