There is nothing like Rhino Market and Deli in Uptown Charlotte unless you count Dean and Deluca which doesn't count 'cause it's a chain and it is just completely different.  if you haven't stopped in this wonderful place yet, please do. You can pick up some ground coffee from a local coffee roaster, a bottle of wine and some cheese for your after work dinner party and a damn good sandwich for lunch all in a day. They have fun gift ideas, plenty of local options and even a local beer map for purchase. All the while the best feel good music of every decade is playing. Today I heard some good ol 2000s R&b with Aaliyah throwbacks. In regards to the food, The ingredients are always fresh, the bread perfectly toasted, and the veggies bursting with color and flavor. The meat isn't too bad either, they definitely provide a healthy portion! I I cannot really compare how incredibly efficient the whole order counter, pay counter and then pick up counter are. The employees are all in sync and by the time you go to pay, you head to the pick up counter and your food is already rather quickly.  Again, please stop in if you want all all around good lunch experience and not simply just lunch.",

All should feel at home in here. They sell specialty drinks, deli items which are available late and have a bar all while playing all genres of music. I believe Ice Cube was playing last night when we walked in. We were surprised, lol. It was pretty awesome. They have a little seating other than the modest bar inside and out. The cashier girl was kind and told me that this was a new concept for her as well when she came from up north.",

So if you want made to order food you order at the window on the right at the middle aisle. You then pay back at the bar and add some coffee (lots of choices) and then pick up your food with your paid receipt at the other window towards the back right of the store. I always worry about the procedural aspects of these markets but this worked smoothly. I ordered the sausage breakfast burrito which was the perfect size. Substantial but not huge. Next time I'd try it without the salsa just because I don't want that little bit of sweetness it provides but it was good either way.",

I almost didn't want to finish the second half so I could enjoy it later. It's a very well oiled machine and they do a great job handling the rush for lunch. While we were there they cycled through at least 90 orders in about 20-30 minutes.   Very pleasant staff as well and the guy eating the almond butter with a spoon in between cashing people out was a good talking point!    Great place for a quick lunch stop. My only suggestion would be to put chips on both sides of the aisles so if you forget to grab a bag you don't have to fight through the line to grab some. However, it is a mistake you would only make the first time you go.",

Well, make sure you place your order with the cashier at or before 11:59am, because she knows and follows the rules and they do not serve breakfast in the afternoon.   Is it 12:04pm? Did you ask nicely? Doesn't matter because they definitely do not serve breakfast in the afternoon!   Did she ask the kitchen if they could prepare your breakfast order? Of course not! She has a watch, and if that watch says it's 12:04pm, that means we are already in the afternoon and, guess what, they do not serve breakfast in the afternoon!  Did she do all of the above with a fake smile on her face? Yes, she did. Did that make the whole experience even worse? Most definitely!  To conclude, if you want to interact with emotionless robots, this is the place to go. If you want to interact with human beings and eat breakfast at 12:04 on a Sunday, go to Not Just Coffee a block away. Which is what I'm doing for the rest of the week!",

It's such a great spot to grab a quick sandwich, stop in for bottle of wine to take home for dinner (from a surprisingly diverse bottled wine and beer selection), or cozy up to the bar and hang out for a while sampling their revolving selection of craft beers. For breakfast or brunch, I absolutely love the Le Monde (egg, sauteed spinach and tomato, melted havarti on rustic sourdough). For lunch, it's the Big Wheel (hot pastrami, swiss, creole mustard, sliced pickles, pumpernickel).",

    "text": "Was in Charlotte for the Half Marathon and as I was walking to the Expo from my hotel, I had my eyes out for a place where I could pick up a quick, healthy lunch, preferably a sandwich. I saw this place as I was walking and based on the reviews, it was Yelp approved.   I've never been to a place like this before (supermarket and deli combo) so walking in I was kind of confused. I saw seating so I was like \"Do I just sit down? Will someone come to get my order if I do?\" But then I saw other people forming a line towards the back and as I peeked my head in that direction, I saw a small window for orders. I stood in that line and reviewed the menu as I waited. I ordered the turkey sandwich on whole grain which consisted of turkey, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and Dijon vinaigrette. After I ordered, they handed me a hand written receipt and told me to pay up front. It didn't make sense at first. Why couldn't I just pay right there? But I quickly understood that the concept was to give customers the option to buy other items within the market and pay as one total up at the front registers. Ok got it! I did grab a bag of BBQ Lays on my way to the register.   Right after I had paid, I went back to the pickup window and my order was announced within a quick few minutes. After I picked up I looked around to see if there was any open seating. There wasn't and even if there had been, I was once again confused. No one had asked me if this was to-go or takeout. I didn't know if I was allowed to sit in there or if that was for customers who specifically stated that they wanted to eat it there? Again, confusing setup.   So anyways I took my sandwich and chips and threw them in my backpack figuring I'd find a public area to eat. Luckily for me, it worked out well. Less than a block away there was a very pretty seating area outside of the Wells Fargo building. It's right by a pretty water fountain and there are many open tables, mostly filled with downtown (or uptown as it's called in Charlotte) coworkers eating lunch together on a Friday afternoon. I really enjoyed dining there!   As for the sandwich, it was pretty average. Nothing you can't make at home, but it was what I was looking for. Overall, just a tiny step above Subway. I'd recommend this as a decent place to grab a bite to eat with coworkers if you work nearby. Other than that, meeeh. Average meal and semi-confusing setup warrants a 3 rating from me.",

Here are my top reasons! 1. RETAIL DRINKING! Love, love, love paying retail for wine. No need for explanation.  2. Great sandwiches and salads, made with love, reasonable pricing and you can eat healthy while you cancel it out with a bottle of bubbles. 3. Self serve coffee, locally roasted and freshly brewed. 4.

    "text": "This is a groovy joint. I say groovy because I'm writing this review as I sit at the RM bar listening to 60s R&B. I have my laptop on WiFi and plugged in to the super convenient/considerate power outlet (the bar has several) as I enjoy a breakfast burrito and cup of coffee. Groovy seems like an appropriate descriptor.   I'm a neighbor of the original Morehead location so Rhino's concept was not new to me. You have the same delicious food, wide selection of beverages, and inviting atmosphere. What's great about the uptown location is that it's a nice change of pace to the usual uptown rest stops. Uptown has plenty of coffee shops, delis, bars, and convenient stores. But Rhino is the only place the combines them in to one (and does it well).   If you are in for breakfast, try the burrito! For lunch, the tofu you sandwich! Have a coffee, have a beer, have a coke, or whatever. You can't go wrong, there really is something for everyone here.",

    "text": "I used to frequent this place on a regular basis ... bring folks there... ( $$$$) have meetings there ...sometimes I'd be there daily ...but no more ...food is still good and there are some folks that work there that are really fantastic ( some of the great employees have left as well so the shift is even more prevalent ) so if you do decide to go fine ...this review is based on customer service atmosphere and my and my friends experiences ...so instead of writing a novel I'll break it down simply:  1. An employee ( a friend of the owner ) was disrespectful to me , other regulars and the staff on several occasions . When it came to me personally the other employees apologized for what he did ( not even going to relay what it was because it still makes me mad )  because they knew me and when he finally came back after the staff said hey you messed up he got mad when I was talking to him ... so he still thought he was right. This also goes with my number 2 and 3 . No repercussions ( friend of the owner )  2. An employee advised I could get a beer because the taps were closing soon ( mind you I had a few friends with me and one was there from incident 1 listed. So another employee when going to the bar walks up to me in my personal space ( like way too close ) and said taps are closed . Which wouldn't had been an issue but they way it was done ( the disrespectful pseudo intimidation  ) which I laughed off because he really didn't want to go there... and it was silly ..my friends were like ... \" you know him ? \" I stated no my first time seeing him ..are they teaching the new staff to be terrible ?   3. The owner had a dispute with one of the vendors and called him a black mutherf*****  in the store ( the vendor was not there ) some of those staff members were ethnic and they heard it of course ...while I heard he apologized later .... anyone who is comfortable enough to do that has said and done much worse about staff , customers etc in private. And the tolerance for bad behavior.  There are other issues some told to me and I've experienced but the last 3 really sealed the deal. They benefitted from common market closing uptown and failed to understand what made that place great. Oh and too cheap fir heaters outside... ( thought I'd throw that in too )   I wish well to the good folks that still work there but I will not ,unless there are mitigating circumstances ,support this business.",

We ordered two Chicken Torta's (one on sourdough bread - toasted and the other one on a poppy seed bagel).  The sandwich would've been amazing (it had all the right ingredients on it) but the chicken was unseasoned and large (cut in big pieces, I would've liked it shredded).  If those two were aligned, then I could've given that sandwich and the experience overall a 5.  Other than that, the customer service was good - no complaints there.  We said we would return to try something new from their menu and give it another shot so we shall see upon our return.",

When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Eric. All the staff are so friendly and I love that they offer the same, trusty selection of beer, wine, and other beverages. I ordered the chili and it was had great flavor and was very meaty/hearty. This location's bar is bigger, which I liked. I also love that they maintain their eclectic wall coverings, which works for Rhino. If you haven't been here, check it out! I think the only downside is parking, but that's to be expected Uptown.",

We ended up getting a lemon blueberry white chocolate cookie (Sweet Girl) and an ice cream sandwich. Both were great.

It lacked flavor, so I added a few condiments on it to add a bit of flavor and it was much better. I like the space and would visit again to order different sandwich.",

They do have a deli counter to order food such as sandwiches, salads and soups. Everyday they offer a special sandwich that changes and a vast variety of drinks, chips and snacks. I went for lunch today and ordered a chicken torta and found the sandwich very basic. I was expecting more spices and exciting flavors, but instead it was a plain chicken breast with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and jalapenos. I will say that this was not my favorite sandwich and would have to give it another go.",

It is hard to find breakfast for under $5 or lunch for under $10 anywhere uptown so this makes it a special gem.   The market is also amazing with anything from wine, craft beer, kombucha, muffins, snacks and even Girl Scout cookies! With the exception of the cookies, there is a considerable markup on those products but the convenience softens the blow.   The cashiers are always very friendly, and even if there is a line, the chefs in the back move quickly.   If you are lucky, they even have live music on some days.",

    "text": "So excited to see another Rhino location.  I've always loved the Moorehead location and glad to see some of our Charlotte favs moving into the Uptown area as more condos and apartment buildings become available.  Right off of Church Street, this location is across from Romeare Bearden Park and is a nice addition to the little strip (along with JJ's and B.Good).  Just a stones throw away from Latta Arcade.  The new location is not as \"lived in\" as the Moorehead location, but I\"m sure it will be in time.  There are a bunch of tables, some limited outdoor seating and a full bar located in the middle of all the action.  The aisles with all the food stuffs are in the middle and the kitchen off to the right.  Moor drink coolers line the back walls but it really is a cool place to sit down, have breakfast, or grab a sandwich.  I would be curious to see what their lunch rush would look like since there should be a lot of uptown workers coming through.  My last visit here, I did a saturday event at BB&T Ballpark and then walked up here to grab a delicious omelete.  It was also pride weekend, so the store was decked out with rainbow banners across the bar seating.  The staff here are super nice and it's just a relaxed place to hang out.  I definitely love their french toast.... well basically all their breakfast items available on the menu.  Confession:  it was 9am and I had a beer, but hey, it WAS Saturday.",

You don't know where to look first.  Do you check out the awesome craft coffee selection? Or perhaps you want to belly up to the bar for a cold craft beer. Hungry? Slide back past the isles of awesome wine and craft beer to the deli and place your order for some really good artisan sandwiches.  Grab a seat, a beer, or coffee and enjoy the atmosphere.  Before you leave browse the many natural and organic products.  There is something for everyone. They carry environmentally conscious products with healthy vibes.  We bought a ton of hard to find craft beer to take home and also had a couple sandwiches on several visits to this location over a couple days. The staff are always so helpful and courteous.

The seating was plentiful but definitely more geared towards a lunch crowd (lots of small tables all in a line) vs. the original which offers a wider variety of seating types and has a cozy factor that makes you want to stay and work awhile.   I like the location of uptown Rhino, which is very convenient to the museums, Romare Bearden Park, and many of the offices. However, due to its urban-ness, parking is hard to come by. Street parking is your best bet, but there isn't a lot. It's also metered, so during the day, it costs.   We went on a Monday evening around 7pm and found out it was trivia night! We didn't play, but were able to carry on a conversation while it was going on since it wasn't crazy busy or overbearingly loud. There was good energy and I would definitely go back with a group :)",

    "text": "So, I only visited this location to hang out with some friends, but it was a good time.   The parking wasn't hard at all because there's a deck right behind it. Totally convenient. I rode the elevator down and walked right inside. Perfect for a rainy day or cold weather.  They had plenty of good wine offerings, the food that my friends ordered looked delicious (but I didn't try any), they have lots of fun snacks, the music was enjoyable and there was plenty of space for us to spread out and chill for a bit.   If you're in the area and looking for a cool place to just sit around for a bit, this is a great option.",

I love the concept of the place and although I don't drink they have beer specials as well as breakfast foods and sandwiches they prepare to order. They even have a water bowl for your fury friends outside!",

    "text": "I went here on Wednesday around 4pm. Wasn't very busy. I've heard good things about the food, but didn't really understand how it works. I sat at the bar by myself and kind of looked around confused. Is it a grocery store? Is it a restaurant? Is it a bar? I know what the name of the place says so DUH.....so if you want to eat there you go and order from the window and they give you a number that they yell out when ready.  The music is the right volume and a good vibe. I def could not hear my order number though from where I was sitting. The bartender got it for me.  Beers were on special for $3.50 if it was under 5% alcohol content.  They have a couch and other seats as well not at the bar. Not a ton of seating.  They have daily specials, live music on certain nights.  As far as the food I got, it was good. I only ordered the portobello sandwich and it was good.  I only saw a few people working but they were all nice. I was there about a hour and some customers came in to by six packs of beer. I'll go back",

    "text": "I dig a good deli / market & was so happy that Rhino has another location near my job. Thankfully, a fellow Yelper took pics of the menu, so I could check ahead of my visit & decide what to get. Who loves a good Reuben?! ME! So I decided to go with this lovely sandwich for my first visit. I don't know why I decided to get a medium sized bag of pork rinds, because when my sandwich came out, I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat everything!  Heaping mounds of beef & sauerkraut - YUM! The bread was so good, too! Decent sized sandwich!  Plenty of snack & beverage choices in the market. Friendly employees & good prices!",

    "text": "Truly a top notch market and deli with so many local goods. My husband and I love this place and come here pretty much on a daily basis. Awesome breakfast sandwiches (I love the Le Monde on toasted wheat, he loves the egg bacon cheddar on an English muffin) and lunch/ dinner sandwich menu. Several vegetarian options as well as daily soup rotation with house veggie available daily. Very solid wine and beer selection and a cozy spot to grab a local draft beer after work. Did I mention they carry King of Pops (including Pup Cups for our furry friends), Golden Cow Creamery, and Pasta and Provisions?! Every staff member is so friendly and truly seem happy to work there. My only wish is that they had a rewards system!",

They play fun music and have eclectic products.  The food Is ok, nothing special, and a little overpriced.  The chicken torta is the best sandwich, but for me it's too much bread and not enough ingredients.    It's in a convenient location which is a plus.  The staff is really friendly.",
