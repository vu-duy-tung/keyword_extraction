The fresh bread that came with it was exquisite.  Although on our second visit, the over was down and we didn't have fresh pita bread.  Get a second over because the fresh pita bread is a strong selling point.  The meals went from 3.5-5 stars.  The Kebab was ok.  I would give it 3.5 stars.  The lamb special on the other hand was amazing and deserves a 5.  Unfortunately they don't have that all the time.  We had some of their sandwiches as well and they were around 4 stars.  On average I would give it a 4-4.5 stars, but I bumped it to 5 because they are consistently good.",

    "text": "Great food, great service and great variety.  What prevented a 5 star rating is the lack of sauces, tsziki style, spicy creamy unique sauces crafted by the chef would push the food to it's potential.  The pita is doughy and delicious, but it needs a unique flavorful authentic sauce for dipping.  The shawarma was very very delicious, and the plain greek style sauce served with it was good.  But where are all the flavorful spices and herbs concocted to make sauces for the kabobs, rice, anything you want?  We asked for a house hot sauce and received a standard chili pepper relish. Grilled veggies were delicious, but the mixture of celery, onions and carrots was just too reminiscient of the base for chicken noodle soup.  If I lived around here I would come back.  The outside seating is very relaxing, the staff knowledgable and very sweet.  I would recommend you try it, I've had shawarma many times, the meats here are delicious.  We wanted more of the other things to make the food amazing.",

It's always a pleasant experience to dine here because everyone is so nice, and the service is wonderfully efficient. Move on to the food, shall we? Simply delicious. From the hot, fresh pita & creamy hummus, to the chicken kebabs / shawarma; and everything in between that I've tried, it's all fresh & yummy. If you're a vegetarian, fret not, because they have some terrific veg options as well. As you scroll through the menu, you may get over ambitious and want to order everything, but refrain from doing that because their entree portions are quite large, and you don't want to fill yourself up so much that you miss out on the assorted baklava & tea for dessert ;) The ambiance of the restaurant is casual; it's simple, clean and comfortable. Go check 'em out, and you'll be dreaming of kebab je too!",

I have three requirements for a fantastic meal out 1) The food is hot and fresh 2) The place is clean 3) The service is good.  I felt like all three of these were addressed wonderfully on Saturday.   The waiter was great, he answered my questions about our food with a lot of enthusiasm. The place was clean and bright - an open kitchen is not an easy thing to pull off but go to watch your pita being freshly baked.   Really though - the food was the real spotlight for me. Everything we had which consisted of the Mixed Grill and a Vegetable plate was spot on. Everything had a brightness to it - a truly magical zing - the flavors were so fantastic. I enjoyed the hummus so much that when the waiter walked away I stuck my finger in the bowl to get the last dollop. Also the falafel was flavored very nicely and fried to a crunchy fluffy perfection. We do have plans to return soon and try the rest of the dishes on the menu.  Recommended to diners that want to try something different without feeling they are out of their comfort zone and people who just enjoy a really good meal.",

The dolmas / dolmades, falafel, cauliflower, fool, lentils and onions and baba-ghanoush where all amazing!  And to make our evening even better than the food...

Our waiter was super helpful including bringing out a sample of the meats and garlic and tahini sauces. I had never even heard of shawarma until I saw the Avengers movie.

Light, fluffy, bread pillows came out of the oven right across from where we were sitting. I've only ever had pita with hummus, so this was new to me... and now I'll never go back to stupid pita. Our waiter told us the bread is so light that he's actually seen it lift up in the oven!   My coworkers and I went for lunch, and it's good thing we got there a little before noon. We pressed our noses to the glass cases as we walked through the restaurant to be seated - good thing the desserts were on the opposite side. Most of the seating is tables up to 4 seats, but we were able to snag the 5-seat table in the back.   We started with the BREAD and hummus, which was fantastic... probably the best I've had in Charlotte. For lunch, I got the Mixed Grill, which was a lamb kebab, beef kebab, and chicken kebab, and I swapped out the rice for a falafel upcharge. They accidentally brought me the rice, which was awesome since it was light and sweet (cranberries and carrots on top). The grilled veggies were okay, but I was much more focused on the meat, falafel, and rice.  it's a good thing I don't live closer to Matthews, or this could become a problem.",

But when the owner is away, then service is lack luster. It's the typical \"when the cat's away\" scenario. It's sad because I know that the owner needs time off as well, but I don't like to go unless the owner is there.",

    "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, you need this pita bread in your life. It's actually a moral imperative at this point to hoof it on down to Matthews and experience it because, if you haven't, you are truly doing yourself a disservice!  But it's not just pita bread that makes this place great--it's the kebabs, the shawarma, it's the you-pick-four vegetarian plate that filled up even my crazily carnivorous tummy! Everything I've tried here has been well-seasoned, expertly prepared, and served hot and heaping by some of the funniest and friendliest waitstaff I've ever encountered. The staff and the owner seem to be truly passionate about making sure diners have a great first impression of Lebanese cuisine. I was hooked from the first bite and have never been disappointed as I've worked my way through a fair bit of the menu.   Highlights for me are: ***the baba ghanouj and tabouleh (authentically awesome) ***the fresh pita bread (remember, moral imperative) ***fried cauliflower (never a better way to eat cruciferously) ***a second basket of pita bread (because you will be fighting your fellow diners for it at some point--so awkward!) *** mixed grill (order the lamb kebab like you do your steak so as not to risk drying out the deliciousness) ***shawarma hummus plate (you will have leftovers, just don't forget the pita bread!) ***spicy potatoes (the sexy, exotic version of home fries) ***date bar or pretty much any pastry in the case (really can't go wrong here)  Things to know: ***the inside dining space is small, so if you have issues with personal dining space, best sit outside if the weather permits ***the mixed veg blend served with entrees is different than most places (seasoned blend of carrot coins, celery, onion, and green pepper)--some folks complained about this, but I thought they were delicious and a refreshing change ***the restaurant is busy, so get there early for dinner ***parking is at a premium in this busy shopping center so be prepared, but it's worth it!  Enjoy, folks! Pita Bread for President in 2016",

Poof - I just turned you into a shish kebab and transported you to Matthews! When you first enter, you will instantly be drawn to the large case loaded with kebabs; they are truly beautiful to look at. And right next to it, some beautiful pastries. The appetizers are simply amazing -  Moutabel (creamy and smoky), Musakaa (a meal in itself), Fried Cauliflower and warm Stuffed Vine Leaves - all of it served with warm fresh baked bread. You could easily make a meal of just appetizers and a salad!! Any and all of the kebabs are good - so pick your preference of chicken, lamb or beef. The entree portions are served on a platter with enough rice and roasted vegetables to feed a small family. My first experience with Shawarma was very tasty - hints of vinegar and cinammon from the marinade - though maybe just a bit dry. I love that you can bring your own beer for a fifty cent per bottle fee ( just bring a growler to get through that loophole!). 4.5 Stars rounded up to Five. Definitely worth a field trip to Matthews!!",

My waitress was incredibly helpful as I had no clue what to pick! I was presented with a HUGE plate of food and every bite was phenomenal. I love the ability to pick and choose so that I was able to get exactly what I wanted and sample a few of their different dishes at once.  Service was wonderful - my server Courtney was awesome!

    "text": "Hey, the food was good, alright? But last night shows us how our memories and senses are affected comprehensively. And in the case of a Yelper like me, that includes the commute, how the day was, the fact that I forgot to mention eating out with friends to the wife all counts.  Yeah, I forgot. So when my wife texted with delight regarding the food she was cooking right before I got off work to go to Kabab Je Rotisserie & Grille, of course I panicked. As I was driving, however, after carefully reminding the wife how I already told her that day (though not sure if I did) and promising that I would be home to eat as well, I ran past a ditch just before getting onto Independence. I do not like Independence. In fact, I don't want to go anywhere that I have to get on Independence to get to.  Anywho, I got there, met my friends, made a new friend named Syed, had a fine Shawarma sandwich and hurried out. To be honest, the shawarma sandwich was good but not great. Nothing exceptional. Don't get me wrong. It's tasty, and most importantly, affordable. I remember it to be just 5.99. But it was a decent size. Actually, the plate would have been too big for me because yes, I did have my wife's food at home. As for the service last night, it was also okay. Nothing bad. But also, not exceptionally good. The fact that you can bring your own beer with a 50 cent charge per bottle is good. But I don't know if I'll drive 40 minutes down to Matthews just for that.",

Ever since we moved from Montreal, the wife and I have been looking for some decent Lebanese food here in Charlotte. I may have just found the spot.  The place was relatively empty when I walked in just shy of 2 o'clock for a late lunch take away. After quickly scanning the large menu, I decided on 2 sandwiches: the meat schawarma and the chicken shish taouk.  The meat schawarma was made with perfectly seasoned and moist shavings of lamb. The shish taouk was a combo of larger pieces of chicken, a garlic sauce explosion and some tangy, tasty pickles.   I was really satisfied with both sandwiches with a slight nod to the schawarma on this visit. Plenty of desserts and pastries to try here and I will definitely return with the wife. I just hope that this kabob place becomes a popular Matthews location and does very well over time.",

Our server Kelly asked if this was our first time and we said yes. He stated we should tour the front to see the rotating swarmas One chicken , One beef ,one lamb . The smells just called to us while we looked at all the kebab variations from salmon,shrimp,lamb,chicken and beef. She asked if we would like to sample the swarma and we said a resounding yes. Everything was fresh it was hard to choose. So we choose beef lamb & chicken. It was AMAZING ! For appetizer we had the hummus which I was Leary about but it didn't disappoint . Creamy and delicious. The pita bread was made fresh and steamed when we opened it. Pita & hummus together was addictive. Kelly was extremely helpful,friendly and knowledgeable about the menu . All the staff were. We tried all his suggestions which were all on point and rocked our palates.hubby had the beef lamb swarma sandwich with  taziki . It was sooo good. I had the swarma chicken sandwich with their garlic sauce. It was also very good I want that recipe. Weill definitely be regulars. Thanks fo an amazing experience @kebabje.com",

In any new place I always ask the server's opinion - she suggested the Mixed Grilled Meat plate so, I did. I was then brought to  a loaf of bread with nothing else to dip it in or anything - I had to ask for it. She brought me a little box of \"so called\"garlic butter\" One taste and I put that soured strange looking mixture away.  Then came my food.  1) The rice was of the most inferior quality I had ever seen and even prepared so incorrectly that it tasted like saw dust. I could not stomach it even with olive oil. 2) The veggies were the most tasteless grilled veggies and with no seasoning at all. I ate only a small green beans. 3) lastly the meat - I tried the \"lamb kabob\" first. still no taste - it felt like chewing on a block of rubber eraser. No seasoning, no taste whatsoever. Then I tried the Chicken which turned out worst than the lamb - tasted nothing like chicken. and finally I tried the beef kabob - the one every mediterranean restaurant gets right. No luck, this place managed to even ruin that kabob. I mentioned this to my server and received no response  Still hungry I asked for a bowl of Lentil soup so I have at least something to eat. The soup was more like a watery yellow mixture of something non-lentils tasting - worst part, it was so so salty that I could not eat more than 5-6 spoon. My mouth is still salty   So, I asked for my check, received the full bill, tipped the server and exited Kabob Je Rotisserie and Grille for the last time.   A real wast of my time and money and a disappointing experience as a person from the region who is used to the real food of the area.",

    "text": "Been to this Matthews spot a couple times now and have been impressed every time.  I usually go with a friend that orders for all of us and we just eat a big feast of delicious food - great for family style sharing, or if you want to bring a date, you can keep your plates to yourself (but what makes food fun is the sharing IMO).  Kabab-Je is tucked into the Sycamore Commons shopping center right off of HWY 51 and Independence Blvd.  It shares the same space as Best Buy and Costco, so the parking lot can get rather busy, but I've never had trouble finding a spot.  In the summers it's nice to relax (get coffee next door or ice cream). There's a good size fountain and benches in the parking lot to hang out around.  Staff and servers are very friendly and genuinely there to make your experience a good one.  They are ready with suggestions if you haven't dipped your feet in the cuisine before - or just make sure you are with Tonya P or and equivalent expert on food matters.  Falafel, hummus shawarma, and the fried cauliflower are just some of the many delicious things that you can get here.  Kababs are always tender and juicy.  Large dessert display for after, but we almost never have room for dessert since the meals are so filling.  Need to go back and try more menu items!  It's a big one, but don't be scuurred... just keep coming back to try new and exciting flavors.",

I was blown away by how good everything was!  We started with hummus, pita (so good!), and falafel, which were all delicious.  My 3-year-old kept asking for more falafel! We actually went through 2 orders of falafel.  I can see going back to this place just for falafel and pita.  I ordered the kid meal pizza for the kiddo and a chicken kabob plate for myself.  My kid's pizza was fresh from the wood fire oven and big enough for an adult.  She was only able to eat one piece since she was so full of falafel, but declared it yummy.  We asked for fresh tomatoes on the cheese pizza, which she loved.  The chicken on the kebob plate was moist and flavorful, as were the grilled veggies and rice.  Our dining companion had a salad with shawarma steak and declared it fantastic. We ended the meal with a piece of chocolate cake for the little one, which despite being full, she managed to polish off.  The adults shared piece of coconut case and it was good.  The service was good and the staff very friendly.  My only complaint is that they have bottled soft drinks and not fountain, but hey, no place is perfect.  For Middle Eastern food, you can't go wrong stopping here.  I am still full as I write this review 6 hours later, but I am finishing so that I can go eat the leftovers and relish in the flavors again.",

If you catch it in the evening sometimes you will even get them absolutely freshly made... the IS the best. mmmm The meat shawarma sandwich... oh my. This is one delicious reasonably priced meal in-and-of itself! It is also an easy meal to take with you on the go but will also fill you up.  The hummus at this place is fantastic! Meal by itself on a cheat night. :-) I have yet to have anything here that is not worth coming back for many times over.  Even the baklava!  Do yourself a flavor and stop by the wonderful place tucked in a nice space near Lowes and Best Buy in Matthews!",

I can't keep track of how many times I've eaten here, but since my husband and I went here for the first time, I don't think it's been over two weeks in between our visits.   The pita bread is made in house and almost always comes out warm and crispy. The hummus is also made in house and tastes slightly different every time, but absolutely delicious. I could eat my body weight in their pita bread.   My husband almost always gets the shawarma plate which comes with really delicious meat (lamb and beef), yellow rice and roasted vegetables. The plate is HUGE and could easily be shared. I really enjoy the shawarma sandwich and the garlic sauce is very tasty.   It's easily become our favorite Mediterranean spot.",

But, if you're looking for outstanding Mediterranean food served piping hot by the nicest wait staff I've come across, you'll love this place. For lunch yesterday my wife and I had lamb kabob sandwich's with spicy potatoes. While the sandwiches were delicious, the potatoes were in a class all their own. They literally exploded with flavor in your mouth. I will never go there again without ordering them. Lastly, whenever he's there, the owner always comes over to your table to see how everything was and to chat for a few minutes. A lovely man. All in all, one of my favorite places to eat in the greater Charlotte area. By the way, unlike most restaurants down here, it is quiet enough at Kabob Je to actually hold a normal conversation. Just another reason to go.",

Parents review: everything was really good - the spicy sausages, felafel, tabbouleh, roasted cauliflower. The chicken lemon rice soup is the best value on the planet (under $4). The entrees are enormous so we split 2 among the 4 of us. We liked the mixed grill with the garlic sauce and the kofta. They don't serve alcohol here but we saw several people bring their own bottles, don't know if there's a corkage fee. The last notable thing about this place is the service - outstanding!!

Well, first and foremost OWNER Yaser can't be more involved and vested in the betterment of this place as well as its growth and more important than anything else OUR SATISFACTION!  2. It's a GREAT FOOD EXPERIENCE story, sometimes I feel I am visiting Lebanon while being in this place  3. Prices are right if not underprice, but Yaser's (Owner) goal is impress with food taste not by Ambiance it seems which seems to be working well so far, and I peeps ally could name so many places that I go only for Ambiance yet the food sucks no doubt but in this place it's all about food, taste and feeling welcome -:) Arabic Hospitality  4. Location is key  5. Nasim the Moroccan Chef behind it all -;) He is a very nice Chef and down to earth and really cares about every single person to be satisfied and have a wonderful eating experience  Keep up the EXCELLENT work ya Chef Nasim  Now to be a fair I have to keep reminding Yaser of the following: 1. Staff more for weekends -:) it can be a pandemonium if you're not there , last time I was there 7/25/15 I was afraid you may get a heart attack because how much you wanted to make sure every single table is served well and Ina  timely fashion and that all are happy !!  2. Lebanese music when you used to play it made this place feel more AUTHENTIC!  3. Few tweaks of ambiance could turn this place to Fine Dining Experience and I'm talking another type of experience that I usually don't look for in Arabic places, but have secrets only seen in Detroit and Cleveland   4. Alcoholic beverages?! Unless religiously can't which is perfectly understandable -:)  LAST BUT NOT LEAST!! In reply to one of the previous review about food falling to the floor and being picked up again to be reserved!! LIAR AND NOT TRUE!! Been here more than 50 times and never seen anything of this sort !! Must be another competing restaurant owner's comment !! Sometimes service was slow and other times receipt inaccuracies or order inaccuracies BUT NOTHING YOU DON'T FIND IN FINEST RESTAURANTS IN Charlotte !! Eat with confidence his place's owner is a very honest person! Simply going through growing pain exactly like Charlotte now -:)  I am a big fan and will always be coming back for the same wonderful experience and Arabic hospitality -:)  Proud of you Kebabje -:) B.

All the dishes were poorly seasoned and the portion size was tiny compared to the price. We would have gladly paid the price if the food was any good, but this wasn't the case. After a few months many friends have told us that the place had improved tremendously and we just had to give them a try again . So against our better judgment we went back.  The portions have improved but the food was still sub par. The vegetables that came with our entrees were boiled instead of being grilled and included celery.  Kinda tasteless and unappealing.  The variety meat platter was overcooked and all the meat except the chicken was dry as the bottom of a shoe. The only thing that was semi tasty was the salad, that came with the meal. Needless to say we will not be going back.",

The fresh pitas are so amazing- so fresh watch out for the steam when you tear into it. For the entree I ordered the falafel sandwich and tabbouleh- authentic and delicious. When you order the iced tea- ask for mint and lemon. Prices are so reasonable. Will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "I had read great reviews of this place so we decided to try it out one rainy Sunday afternoon. I ordered a vegetarian plate (hummus, lentils, a salad and more-ask your waiter for help, they explained all dishes very well) and my husband got the lamb. I've never cared much for lamb but this was delicious! I tasted cinnamon and other spices that worked SO well with the very tender meat. It came with a stew of veggies and was more than two people could eat. In fact, both dishes were huge. They also bake their own pitas there, and they are fresh, warm and tasty - perfect for dipping . We took hope a few desserts, the baklava, a date cake and a piece of chocolate cake. All of the food was delicious except the date cake (like a super buttery fig newton-it was just too rich with not enough flavor).  The only downside was service. We came at an odd time, around 2pm. I always find that to be the absolute worst time to get good service (rush is over, check out & servers seem to get busy with side work) so I'll let it slide. Plus, they sat us in an odd spot near the bathroom/kitchen area so we were out of sight, out of mind (and they forgot/lost our ticket). They did try to make up for it with a wonderful cabbage salad & hummus apps for free. That cabbage salad was one of the best things I've ever tasted, and it's not even on the menu. The chef was just trying it out that day as a special. Everything tasted so great and the compensation for the poor service gets them 4 stars, and will go back for more. I love it when I leave a restaurant and can't stop thinking about going back for days. This was that kind of meal.  The atmosphere is pretty good if you're not seated in the back. I like that the kitchens and baking area are open. There's a lot to watch and while our server wasn't attentive, I have to say that the others were very concerned about us and made sure we were well taken care of. I'd recommend this place anytime for lunch or dinner. Just know that you can split any meal and leave full - probably with leftovers.",

Since moving from Michigan in 1989 to Charlotte we have really missed authentic Greek, Mediterranean, and Lebanese food.  This place completely satiated our missing the food in Greek town.  The hummus is the smoothest, tastiest we have ever had. The pita made in the restaurant before your eyes  is piping hot and delicious.  The Kebabs are spiced to perfection.  The most incredible part of the experience however was our waiter Raymond.  Knowledgable, friendly, efficient, attentive, polite even though the restaurant was slammed with patrons.  Raymond's recommendation of the mixed Grill Kebib was spot on.  I hope the owners know what an extraordinary asset Raymond is to their business.  This is a top notch cuisine experience. We live in North Charlotte but will definitely return for the food and the experience.",

    "text": "My wife and I have eaten here at this bustling little Mediterranean joint at least twice a month since we discovered it thru Yelp nearly a year ago. It has become one of our favorite Charlotte restaurants and we have yet to be disappointed. Dining is a little tight inside and lines form early so expect a wait if you get there after 6:00 in the evenings.   All of the the food is fresh, flavorful and plentiful. The star of the show is the pita bread made fresh continually in their conspicuous stone oven and is served fluffy and hot! Unlike many other similar restaurants, it is included with most entrees. You will and must add the creamy smooth hummus though which you can buy as a side for around 5 bucks it as part of the four item veggie plate for around $11.   Speaking of the veggie plate, we always order it along with the 3 meat combo at $17. We always choose the hummus, falafel, grape leaves and tubouleh on the veggie plate (all are fabulous) and the kafka, lamb and chicken skewers as our meat choices. The chicken has always been tender and tasty, as has the lamb, which they recommend be served medium rare. Love the yellow rice that is prepared with raisins and sliced sliced carrots, squash, mushrooms, onions and peppers.  We've enjoyed all of the soups (especially the lemon orzo) and salads. The beverage choices are limited however, especially the soft drinks which are canned. The tea is okay. Lastly, the desserts look scrumptious in the display case and are very good but are not made in house and are too pricey for such small servings.   Service is always attentive and knowledgeable of menu choices. Sanitary rating is consistently in the high 90s and Yassar, the appreciative owner, is always on on-site greeting guests and orchestrating his restaurant the way a conductor does a symphony. He is one yet another reason we love this place and will continue to return.",

    "text": "I had eggs this morning: 2, over medium with a touch of chili powder. I like eggs a lot. They're full of protein and fats, and when your on a low carb diet, those are you're end all be all of comfort.   The reason I preface my review of lunch with what I had for breakfast is I want you to appreciate how hungry I was. When you cut bread and sugar from your diet, staying satiated for longer than the run time of a long movie is pretty much out the window. The plus side is you can eat more without gaining weight on account of your body not being able to rely on that sweet sweet sugar for energy.   The negative? When you do wait, like I did, for a traditional meal to eat (to be fair, I fell asleep watching lectures on YouTube. Don't judge my Saturday) you get super hungies. So I'm yelping, and  I find this well reviewed kebab place about a 15 minute drive down 74, or in charlotte terms, down the street. I could really go for some lamb at this point, so I throw on some clothes and hit the door.   I pull into Sycamore Commons, a shopping area I frequent, so imagine my surprise when the Google box directs me to this secluded little alcove behind the Best Buy, replete with shops and a massage envy,  and a sweet frog. Amongst them is the kebab place.   The hostess seats me outside facing the fountain. The set up of the main dining room is slick, because no matter where they seat you, you walk by a deli style display case featuring ready to cook skewers of beef, of chicken, of salmon to whet your appetite. The outdoor seating area has nice stylish large umbrellas to keep the sun at bay.   The menu is classic Mediterranean, all lamb and mint and tsaziki. I ordered minced lamb - which comes in a kebab and is served with basmati rice, a tabouleh salad and hot tea. If you recall the opening paragraph, you'll remember the low carb thing, and wonder why I didn't sub out the rice for, like, a chicken wing or something. Well i, in fact, did sub it out for the Spicy Lebanese salad.  Then the spiral downward started. My order came out, and boy howdy was it wrong. The first transgression: no tabouleh. I love tabouleh. It'd been over a year since I had it, and my excitement to have it again was severely dampened by the distinct lack of it on my plate. I did get rice, though. Rice I didn't want because of the low carb thing. I tasted it. It was good. Exceptional even. Especially the carrot slaw they had on top. But still, low carb is in effect,  so I couldn't actually enjoy the rice.   Second transgression: the Spicy Lebanese salad, which came out as a side was fine. But it was out as a side and not the rice substitute that I wanted it to be. I ate it. It was pretty good, not quiet what I wanted it to be, but solid enough.   Third transgression: as I approach the bottom of my salad i have decided not to complain (because God clearly wanted me to have that rice and not tabouleh, otherwise he wouldn't have put the rice and not the tabouleh in front of me). I look again at the fountain. It's very nice, calming. Relaxing.  Three spires in white plaster or stucco, can't really tell from where I am, with water cascading down the bronze or tiled (again, can't tell) centers. It's a good fountain. I bite down on my salad, and to my horror, there's a crunch that matches no other crunch in the salad to that point. And the crunch has a bitterness, and a dryness. I spat that bite out to reveal splinters of charred black something. I was now upset.   No tabouleh? Forgivable. Rice when I can't eat it? Cruel, but I can look past that. But burned splinters in the salad? A bridge too far.   Now you're probably thinking that this is a 1 star, no recommendation review. You'd be only half right. I'm not going to recommend kebab-je because they made a Slack first impression. However they should thank the server, because no sooner than I brought the various transgressions to his attention, did he not only comp my burnt splinter salad, but he did also bring me to-go tabouleh, which is second only to during the meal tabouleh on the tabouleh depth chart.  Plus the kebab was tasty (could've used a dipping sauce, but I liked it). And until it was burnt, the salad was good. And the rice was delicious. And my water cup wasn't empty until I left.  I probably won't be back for a while, though.  *P.S., the owner has apologized and invited me back. Adding a half star to My review for the consideration. Also the tabouleh was among the best tabouleh I've had. Easily one of the 3 best salads in Charlotte. Adding another half star for the tabouleh alone.",

They have a very nice patio area and the interior is nice as well. Great spot to go with friends or with a significant other.  The chicken and lamb kabobs are very good. I didn't care for the beef kafta. It seemed like it was just ground beef on a skewer. The falafel is very good - crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The garlic sauce is out of this world. I put it on everything! The pita is good and is great to stuff everything in to make a wrap. The saffron rice is flavorful and my favorite type of rice. The mixed vegetables are really good but the carrots tend to be undercooked which is a disappointment as they are my favorite. The tabbouleh was good to add to my wrap but I probably wouldn't get it alone. I really liked the fattoush salad- comes with pita chips, cucumber, tomato and other stuff- the dressing was really good on this.   If you haven't been here then you should go! Great introduction to authentic Mediterranean food.",

My family got the 12 skewer meal with lamb, chicken, shrimp and salmon! They let you mix and try different skewers. It was more than enough for a family of 6. I also tried the chicken shawarma and Kafta sandwiches and they were very filling. The grilled chicken wings in garlic  were a great addition to the pita, hummus and we also added tabbouleh for appetizers. All of the flavors were very strong and lasting and the food is more than filling! Very family friendly and the veggies are fresh. They have great customer service and were very accommodating. We were too full to try dessert but I took a pic to at least let you see!",

He is someone who is very good at remembering faces and names and seems to truly enjoy taking care of customers. The food is amazing. There are times when I follow a vegetarian diet and there are many choices. The falafel and fried cauliflower are well seasoned. You can get them alone, as a platter or as a sandwich as with most of their items. The vegetable stews and spinach pies are also great choices. For those who eat meat, the kafta kish kash and lamb platter are very good. The lamb is cooked all day and many nights is on special. The shawarma is moist and cooked perfectly. It is not the premade \"slab o meat\" that many places use. It is great on the salads and again, available as a platter or sandwich as well. There are kids items for young ones as well as manakish \"pizzas\" that fulfill the need as well as those beautiful fluffy homemade pitas that come to the table still steaming. The wait staff is always on point and happy to explain some of the more exotic menu items. If you are not ridiculously full from the large portions, consider one of the homemade desserts and some Lebanese coffee.",

We stopped by last Saturday and have since visited with other family members on Wednesday.  As some photos show it has a deli type display where you can look at the food and ask questions...and they are very happy to help answer.    On both visits our waiter was Sammy, he is such a nice guy and really helpful in giving information and answering our questions.  Visit one we shared a mixed kabob plate and everything was very tasty, we loved the garlic sauce. :)  We also shared a Fattoush salad which was very tasty and a large serving.  For desert we had a bun/cheese dish served with rose water that was very good I just have no idea what the name was.  Visit 2 we had the feta salad which was good but I liked the Fattoush better.  We again shared the mixed grill kabobs wich again we cooked perfect!  For appetizers we got the Batata Harra which I liked but I wish it wasn't so oily, the first time I ahd these was in GA and they were crispy and almost like they were baked...  We brought my son and his wife, both gave it 5 stars....we all will be back and soon.",

    "text": "The best thing about this place was their hummus.  It was definitely made in-house and it had the perfect amount of lemon, garlic and tahini.  It wasn't bland which tends to be the case in most places and it was very creamy.  The bread served with the hummus was definitely unique.  It was a big pastry puff  that was filled with steam/hot air.  It was fluffy and lightly salted.  It was a nice alternative to the typcial pita bread.  The rest of our dining experience was not as great.  The menu was a little challenging to follow as it just seemed all over the place.  I ordered the chicken kabob but it didn't mention what it was served with other than a side of garlic.  My husband ordered the kabob wrap and again, no sides were mentioned.  My chicken kabob was served with rice and some pickled mixed veggies (both were not very good).  The kabob itself had so much potential but it was undercooked.  The meat on the skewer was fleshy and it bounced back when I touched it.  The inside was a light pink color and not heated all the way through.  I lost my appetite pretty quickly but didn't want to say anything as we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for a whole other meal to come out.  It took way too long for the first meal to come out so we weren't about to wait for another one.  My husband's wrap was good but it was very small and came with no sides.  At least we will know this for next time.  He could have/should have ordered two and a side to go with it.  The service was subpar and everyone seemed stressed and unorganized.  The restaurant had an awkward lay out and super bright lights.  It was an uncomfortable dining experience overall.  There is a huge deli section in the center and then an exposed kitchen in the back and somehow a few tables positioned around the deli counter.  I think they will likely work out some of these issues but as of right now I am not impressed.  I was so excited to see a Mediterranean restaurant in the Matthews area but this place has some work to do.",

Also tried a beef lamb mixture which was really good as well.   Staff is very friendly and knowledgable about the dishes. We will be back without a doubt. Updating my review to 5 stars. We have been to this place numerous times now and it is always excellent. The beef kabobs are my favorite and the humus is the best I've ever had!",

For appetizers, we had the Moutabal (Smoked Eggplant dip with freshly made pita bread) and Batata Harra (cubed sauteed potatoes).  Both were excellent. For entrees, we had the Mixed Grill (kababs of kafta, chicken and lamb), and the Falafel Sandwich.  The kababs were served with their special garlic paste.  Oh my!  That put everything over the top.  Both dishes again were outstanding.    20min wait to get in at 7:30pm.  Totally worth the wait. To top it off, the owner personally came to our table twice and I shook his hand and thanked him for everything.    We'll be coming back again for sure!",

I have other good falafel in the area, but this had the full package.  The warm pita at the start could have been a full meal.  I almost forgot to mention the very attentive service.

In addition to my lunch being so delicious, my server, Tyler Meadows, was a joy. He is so friendly and helpful, and it was a pleasure having him wait on me.

The cranberries in the rice also compliment the dish very well because it adds a sweetness in the midst of the smoky and garlic flavors -- I really like garlic so that's why I add the garlic sauce to it; you don't have to. ALSO the hummus. My goodness that hummus is good, and when you pair it with warm freshly made pita bread *speechless* So good. Highly recommend.",

I read in Charlotte magazine that the pita oven was custom made and couldn't fit through the door, so they had to make a hole in the wall to get it inside- all the trouble was worth it, because the fresh pita from that oven is amazing. Two people can easily stuff themselves to the point of discomfort for about $20 on pita, hummus and \"sandwiches\" (more like wraps), or spend about $16 for an entree and have enough food to take home for an entire second meal later. This place reminds me of the DC suburbs or the Bay Area where the best multicultural food options are usually in nondescript locations. Kabab-Je forever!!",

We were quickly seated outside on the patio where we were greeted by a very friendly waiter named Ray who informed us the restaurant was Lebanese. As we looked over the menu  our waiter brought us out a little sample plate filled with some different meats and sauces so we could experience some flavors before we ordered. The girls wiped the plate out before I even could get a piece. Well from there on out everything we ordered was was awesome. The smoked eggplant dip with fresh made warm pitas,chicken wings, shrimp kabob, chicken wrap,3 meat kabob dinner and a childrens pizza. One tasted better then the next. After dinner I had to try a True Lebanese dessert a warm cheese with wheat germ crushed and rose water syrup wow what a different and delicious dish. Food is great, service was even better can't wait to return.",

It's a very cute restaurant with an open kitchen and counters filled with the neatest salads, desserts, finger foods, etc.  We came for lunch and it was pretty busy but we did not have to wait for a table.  They have indoor and outdoor seating which is really nice.  We sat indoors because it was a bit hot outside.  Our waiter was incredibly helpful, well-spoken and he brought us samples of the shawarma--which we had to try after Robert Downey Jr seemed so interested in it in the movie The Avengers (we had never tried it).  It was so good!  They have excellent hummus, salads are perfection, and if you don't get the pita bread you are seriously going to regret it!  We had the cauliflower sandwich, shawarma sandwich, falafal and salad, all were tasty.  We will definitely be back!",

We ordered the hummus which was DELICIOUS and smooth, drizzled with olive oil and served with freshly made pita. We also ordered the friend cauliflower, and chicken and lamb Schwarma. Everything was perfect! There is also a deli area that looks like you can get food to take home. Would definitely recommend this place if you love good fresh Mediterranean/Lebanese cuisine.",

She's vegetarian and I'm pescatarian so it's always hard to find a place for us. The set up here is cute and quaint almost reminds me of a little cafe. I ordered the scallop entree and she ordered the veggie entree. The scallops were good and the basmati yellow rice was good, however it's almost like they added extra everything to the dish. The zucchini and squash were overbearing and the cranberries in the rice were unnecessary. The kebab itself was great and I would love to try their falafel one day just to try. I feel like now I know how to properly order and maybe one day will come back to give the place a try.",

Over used squash.   The lamb/beef mixture skewer was 80% Low quality hamburger and 20% lamb. Still no seasoning.   The steak skewer, although no seasoning, was the best. Still small, but tasted good.   Glad I went to try it out. But I will not return.",

I had a friend that would always cook me authentic Lebanese foods (tabouleh, fatoosh, moujaddara, Kafta, ect.) and this place tastes exactly like all the greatness she would feed me. I tend to lean towards the veggie plate, which offers four vegetarian options, and my boyfriend always gets some kind of wrap/ sandwich such as the chicken shawarma and we both love everything we have ever had from here. Everything is always fresh, delicious and full of flavor. This is easily going to always stay in a regular rotation for us whether it's dine in or takeout.",

This event gave me a chance to try a large cross-section of Kabab-Je's menu at a fairly low cost. I'm really excited about this event series, and I look forward to the next such event.   Kabab-Je serves Lebanese food, which is fairly similar to other Mediterranean cuisines, but they have different items from Le Kebab Grill or the recently closed Lazeez. Among the dishes I tried, I think my favorite was the kofta kebab, which was flavorful and perfectly cooked. I also liked the spinach pie, baba ganoush, fattoush salad and kibbeh, and even the stuffed grape leaves, which are usually not my favorite. The moussaka was an interesting dish because their version is very different from the Greek dish of the same name; it's roasted eggplant in a red sauce, while the Greek version is more like lasagna.   Overall, my meal here was a fun experience that allowed me to try a lot of excellent food. I'd eat at Kabab-Je regularly if I didn't live on the other side of town.",

The grilled chicken kebab sandwich with no pickles- love. Spicy potatoes- love (they are not spicy in heat but called spicy bc it has spices). My husband loves the lentil soup. Great place, great healthy food options. The only thing I would change is that the pita bread on sandwiches be fresher.

We split the beef shawarma plate and chose rice instead of potatoes.  The shawarma was tasty and lean even though it had pieces of lardon thrown in (which I picked out) to keep it moist.    For dessert we tried the fig square which was kind of like a less sweet fig newton.  Would go great with coffee but was a little too simple on its own - this being a critique from an American who is used to overly sweet desserts.    Overall though \"loved it.\"  They've only been open since July and I hope they keep going strong because I'll be back to try a falafel sandwich and the mixed grill platter!",

The manager is truly one of a kind. He is always walking around checking on tables and making sure everyone is satisfied.   I am absolutely in love with the food. The hummus is truly one of a kind. Amongst my other favorite appetizers include the grape leaves, the sausage and the chicken wings. The sauce on the wings is the perfect blend of lemon and garlic.  The chicken shawarma sandwiches are great! I also love the kabobs. I never know which kabobs I want so I always get the mixed grill which allows me to get a chicken, lamb and a kafta kabob. The kabobs go great with a side of the spicy potatoes.   When it comes to price, you can't beat this place. The portions and taste are well worth the prices. I'm not sure why some of these other reviews say the food is overpriced. I guess they're just used to McDonald's dollar menu. That says a lot about their taste in food.    If you want authentic Lebanese food in Charlotte, this is the place to go! Trust me, I'm Lebanese and this place is as legit as it gets. I personally love sitting outside enjoying this great weather. If you're new to the cuisine or grew up on this food, trust me, you will not be disappointed.",

The owner is always present and greets every guest personally and frequently visits the tables to make sure everything is satisfactory.   The eggplant el-rahib, foul, and tabouleh are our staple appetizers. The lamb shank entree is to die for. It is flavorful and falls off the bone. The chicken kabob sandwich is also another favorite.   You really can't go wrong with anything here.

They assured me I was safe, so we decided to try it. We loved it so much, we went back the next night and brought some hummus to a friend, who loved it too. We also got a cooler to bring some back to Jacksonville. I had the same thing both nights,  the veggie plate, where you choose 4 items from 7, I believe.  Our server's, Allison, suggestions were spot on. I enjoyed every bite. My wife tried the Chicken Swarma sandwich and loved it with the pickles, but really wanted more hummus the next night.  Probably the best hummus we've ever had. If you are ever in the area, we highly recommend this restaurant.",

There are no free soda refills, if you order soda it comes bottled and it's $1.95 per bottle so be prepared.

My server was overwhelmed and attempted to gloss over poor service with disingenuous engagement. The space is too small for the current layout (prep stations, grills with refrigerated cases surrounding them in the center.  Each time staff showed customers deserts in the case, their backsides were in my space...not nice EVER but especially when you're attempting to enjoy a meal. Once the owner left the floor, I was subjected to a ten minute exchange between the table behind me and a young man behind the refrigerated cases in the food prep area.  Obviously not aiming for ambiance although my check reflected a price that represented an expectation of a pleasant atmosphere.  If you can feel the effects of servers repeatedly swishing by the table, something just isn't right. I hope these detractions will be corrected as I would definitely consider a third try due to the positive aspects, maybe an earlier dinner.",

    "text": "This place is the best middle eastern restaurant in Charlotte without a doubt. The bakery in the middle of the restaurant  with their food display is amazing. You know the food will be amazing when you have a lot of middle eastern people eating there.  We ordered a bunch of things. warm grape leaves, baba ghanouj, zatar, mixed grill and a cauliflower sandwich. The baba ghanouj  was just fantastic. I really could taste the smoke inside it. They served this with a huge freshly made whole pita bread. Gosh I dont think I have ever eaten pita bread that tasted better! The grape leaves were great. Quite a different flavor from the other places where i have eaten grape leaves. It had this pickled taste. Zatar was ok. But we had too much food and took most of the zatar home. Mixed grill was great. The side of rice and vegetables was sublime. I have no idea how they made the  veggies taste that good. Cauliflower sandwich was ok. I just wanted to try something different and ordered it. I would think the falafel would be better for vegetarians.   The service was crazy good. The waiter was super attentive and seemed to genuinely want to make ur meal super pleasant.  Cant wait to go back and try more things on the menu.",

The thing that happened next is the reason that I have not been back.  They proceed to take it to the back kitchen and not even five minutes later they come back with a new spit of lamb and it's dripping wet!!  I was shocked and disgusted.  I would love to go back because the food was good but I can't get over them just washing off the lamb and bringing it back out.  I'm sorry it's taken me so long to post folks.",

Everything we've had is great (esp the kababs) -- but the garlic sauce is ridiculous.  I was surprised at some of the negative reviews here, but noticed most of them seem to be clustered around the time they opened back in July.

The portion was very large for only 10.5 and the meat was tender and flavorful, although mild and spices the lamb itself was tender and flavorful. The service was great as well. I went again last night and the food was pretty average or even bad. The shwarma on the vertical rotisserie looked very tempting so I ordered beef and lamb shawarma entree unfortunately the meat was so dry and tough it was approaching beef jerky texture and dryness. The vegetable medley that comes with it was also extremely bland.  Had to soak it in lemon juice and salt and garlic sauce in order to get the entire meal down. Again the service was excellent so at least they're consistent in that department but I doubt I will go back given that shawarma is my favorite Middle Eastern food and theirs is horrible.  I have now been here several more times and the food and service has been above average. That is why I am raising my review from 2 stars to 4 stars. Overall I suggest going there other than ramadan buffet.",

Since then I have recommended and taken many of my friends to Kabab Je. The owner Yassar makes you feel at home when you walk in the door. His staff is so courteous and polite. Everything is so good.

Prices are great.  Tonight's special was LAMB SHANK with almond brown rice and braised vegetables for $10.95. Felt like a high end plate that could've cost $18.   The pick 4 veggie platter, also $10.95, had many options to choose from but our waiter allowed me a choice from the appetizer menu not even in the veggie listing. Very accommodating. The PATATAS HARRAS were perfectly crispy, but light on the garlic. However, do yourself a favor and add a side of GARLIC SAUCE. It is so lemony and amazingly delicious! I could've eaten it plain. It made everything even better. The HUMMUS was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of salt. And the best part is that it comes with a freshly baked poufy pita. The FALAFEL, while a bit softer on the inside than I usually prefer, had great exterior crunch and very good flavor. We also tried the FRIED CAULIFLOWER, which is tossed with tahini and nice, but next time I'll try Tabbouleh or their version of baba ghanoush for a little more flavorful options.  MANAKISH CHEESE AND ZAATAR was interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but it was a bit greasy and limp for my tastes.   I ended the meal with a PISTACHIO BAKLAVA, which is not made in house, but comes from the finest baklava bakery in the US (Shatila). I prefer Shatila's finger baklava, as it has more crunch than typical, but it was still a nice ending to the meal.   I wish that Kabab Je weren't so far from where I live because I'm going to be making the trek for this food often.",

I'm not a big red meat eater... unless it's bacon :-)  Took baklava, pistachio baklava and date thingy home for dessert. All were excellent. Sat in the back near where the food was picked up. Waiter Mahmoud (sp?) was very attentive and polite. Owner stopped by a couple times also. He apologized if it was too noisy where we sat but we thought it was great. It was like a meal with a show, and we were in the middle.  He keeps his staff on their toes running that restaurant like a well oiled machine.  We will be back for sure.",

The shawarma bread and garlic sauce were great for tearing off little pieces and making mini bites with the chicken, and rice. Overall very satisfying to the pallet, and I I liked that I could eat the majority of the meal with my hands.

Our waiter, Kelly, was not only very friendly, but also highly informative about the menu and the restaurant.   He made us even more excited about the menu options and all the sauces.  The atmosphere here is cozy.  It really does have a Mediterranean flare.   They are doing everything right here.   A few people came by our table to make sure our food was okay.

    "text": "My only reason for driving from Hickory to Matthews, was to have lunch at Kabab-Je. This would be my first foray into the world of Lebanese food.   My server, Mr. Hunt, pushed expensive menu items. He neglected to mention the many reasonably priced daily specials.   Later, while I was eating, I heard another member of their waitstaff describe their specials in great detail to an adjacent table. There was one special that day including hummus, mixed lamb and beef shawarma, and vegetables for $8.95, which was EXACTLY what I wanted. I almost lost my appetite. SMH! Hearing about their many reasonably prices daily specials that weren't offered to me, made me displeased.   MOUTABAL APPETIZER, $5.50, 1/5. Taste: Tahini & Lemon. PITA BREAD, 2/5. Taste: Nothing. Unsalted. LAMB SHANK, $13.95, 3/5. Texture: Tender. Taste: Nada.  STEAMED VEGGIES: 0/5. Taste: No seasoning, so no taste. Bland.  SAFFRON RICE: 3/5. Taste: It's sad when the rice is the most flavorful thing on the table. DRINKS: 20 oz. bottled Coke. 2 x $1.95 = $3.90.  The primary reason for the low scores was because - NOTHING WAS SEASONED! Nothing, zip, nada, not even salt and pepper was used to prepare dishes. How does one serve a middle eastern dish, the home of bazaars and the world's spice trade, without one iota of spice, salt, or pepper? An African American auntie from the deep South could teach their chefs a thing or two about seasoning food.   SANITATION: 96.5%. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.cdpehs.com%2FNCENVPBL%2FINSPECTION%2FShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx%3FESTABLISHMENT%3D129772%26esttst_cty%3D60&s=8dd7a4653998b4aac9e2742f210c129525125a784314192c1222bc46cc673207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">public.cdpehs.com/NCENVP...</a>  BILL: $25.27. After tip: $32.00+. This was about twice what I wanted to spend for lunch. Totally not worth the price - or the drive to Matthews.",

Couple of months ago, my parents were visiting from out of town and they were wondering if Charlotte had any Middle Eastern restaurant to try. One of my cousins who lived in Charlotte longer than I have, suggested Kabab-Je Rotisserie & Grille, so we went.   Traditional Mediterranean fare. I'm talking about warm dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), foul mudammas (an ancient Middle Eastern bean dip) and an irresistible kanafeh (golden phyllo with a base of gooey N slightly salty cheese, and topped with spiced syrup).  Give Kabab-Je a try and you won't be disappointed!!  Four and Half Yelps!",

I thought I knew what was up in the world of hummus. Then, I went to Kabab-Je and had their shawarma hummus plate. My world was rocked, y'all. My mind blown. Every bite of hummus I'd ever had was brought into question. What was this crap I'd been eating and how does Kabab-Je make hummus so good it puts all others to shame?   Part of the magic is the meat (a combo of beef and lamb) they pile on top. Warm and flavorful, freshly carved from the giant kabob spinning at the front of the store. The freshly baked, warm, fluffy pita bread doesn't hurt either. Still, I think they must be sprinkling crack or MSG or something else addictive on top of that hummus. I just can't get enough! Good thing all that is only $8.95.   After every visit, I find myself thinking about when I can go back again without embarrassing myself too much. Is lunch and dinner in the same day too much? Asking for a friend.",

The atmosphere is busy and space is a bit tight but in my opinion it's intimate and quaint. The tables are located around where food is prepared, which made me feel like a part of the experience.   The service was wonderful. Our waitress was there when needed, and didn't hover. She was very attentive.   The food was phenomenal! Man, you get so much food for what you pay, and the food tastes so fresh! We got falafel and the fried cauliflower for appetizers. That cauliflower was to die for.   I had the chicken kabob entree for lunch...it came with two big chicken kabobs, basmati rice, and delicious grilled veggies. I also had the pistachio baklava. I thought the size of the baklava would be what I'm used, triangular and about 4 inches in length, but it was a two-bite surprise. It was perfect!  I can't wait to go back!",

The Tabboulieh was the best ever.  I thought I made fantastic tabboulieh but this was so much better.  We both had the Lamb Shank which came on a bed of rice and veggies.  Our waiter told us what kind of rice it was, maybe Basmati but I don't think that is what he said nevertheless my husband nor I are big rice fans but by the time we finished our meals later that evening back in the motel where we ate every morsal. The Pita was light and freshly made.  It was good enough to take an extra one with us.  I suspect we will make a trip sometime soon just to eat there.  Lastly the owner was there and it is obvious from his demeanor how much he cares for people including his staff.  He told us about his daughter attending law school in Columbia where we live.  His zest for life spreads to restaurant.",

I tried the falafel twice and it was the tastiest I've had in this city, by far. The shwarma with hummus ($8.50) is excellent, I ordered it with a combination of both chicken and beef-lamb shwarma on it, both meats were tasty and moist the humus was primo and there was more food that I could eat.    Henny the waiter was professional and personable both, a nice change of pace  from the typically friendly but clueless service we see so much of today.  btw they open every day of the week",

    "text": "I was recently visiting family in NC and my daughter insisted we have lunch here. So glad we did! The food is authentic and amazing! I had the minced lamb kebab! Delicious! You have to be open to the real deal here! Lebanese at its finest! No fake American altered cuisine! You get to watch them prepare your food fresh too! The food case was so beautiful in the center of it all that I had a hard time deciding what to order! Lol!   I over heard someone not happy with their dish and the server was extremely accommodating to replace it for them right away! I could tell it was the flavor and not the dish!!!!! Remember, you have to have the palette for authentic cuisine! This is no run of the mill place!    The owner went out of his way to greet us. Since my daughter frequents the place, they were very attentive, but I noticed that all the guest are treated that way too! I loved the flavors of my food so much that I had to score a container of spice to bring back to Arizona! They have a small selection of items you can purchase and the staff will educate you on how to use them. I've used this particular spice, not sure the name of it, the tag came off during my travels, on everything from my morning eggs to my chicken, fish and of course LAMB! Wow!   Lastly, it is a great place for inside or outside seating, large or small groups except call ahead for parties over 10 so they can accommodate you accordingly. Great place for the family! The granddaughter was happy at the young age of 2 1/2 yrs old!  Seems to be ideal for catering, but not sure if they offer that. Just ask!  This will be my first stop when I return to NC in the future! Can you open one in Scottsdale??? I haven't found a good Lebanese place here yet!   Enjoy!  Pamela",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. My only (selfish) gripe: why isn't there one closer to uptown?  Kabab-Je is a Mediterranean restaurant with a focus on the Lebanese cultural region. So, a lot of healthy ingredients- olive oil, garlic, lean meats, mixed veggies. Everything is made fresh in-house.  I tend to over-order here every time. The problem is that I just want too many things. I really love all the sides, so I will typically get a veggie plate. I usually go with stuffed grape leaves, the smoked eggplant dip (moutabal), falafel, and the potatoes. If I'm with someone, I like to do a veggie plate, plus hummus, and kababs of some sort so we can split it all.  Bottom line, I don't really think you can go wrong with anything you get here. There's a reason this place lands so high on the Yelp Charlotte Top 100 list every year. If you're unsure about the menu or have questions, make sure to ask. Everyone is so nice and friendly. I highly recommend coming with a group of friends, so you can order a bunch of things and share.   If the Matthews restaurant is not convenient for you, they also have a location over in Stonecrest.",

Lebanese food, as it was explained to us, is not hot-n-spicy but delicious, nonetheless, with flavors textures, and recipes common to the region.  I think they basically cooked the menu for us: potatoes, hummus, kebbeh, stuffed grape leaves, fattoush salad, falafel, musakaa, tabbouleh, babaganous, fried cauliflower, chicken, steak and lamb kabobs.  My favorite?  The kebbeh.  Ground lamb surrounded by goodness and fried to a crunchy exterior.  Mmm.  Service was spectacular.  Thank you,  Kate, for how you handled my end of the long table.

There's a nice outdoor patio you can also enjoy. It's a nice dining atmosphere, clean and simple. The servers are so friendly and helpful in describing the menu items if needed.   Most of the menu has helpful descriptions but what you need to know is everything is delicious and you just can't go wrong. We loved the fried cauliflower appetizer, a big portion, a whole cauliflower cut into chunks, not breaded, just slightly crispy on the outside, drizzled with a yogurt tahini mild sauce, delicious!  For lunch I chose the meat schwarma sandwich, a pita rolled with meat slices, pickles, and veggies with a sauce, then crisped and heated, so good! They also offered sandwiches and plates with falafel, chicken, kofta, tabouli, salads, and more. My sister with severe diet restrictions eats here often.

The menu is packed with plenty of freshly prepared options, but they always offer daily specials at a great value.  They bake their pita bread on site and that Tahini sauce they offer is out-of-this-world!  If you need two, it's totally worth it to pay for an extra sauce because you will probably be asking for a to-go box and will want more sauce with your left-overs!",

    "text": "Went here with a foodie group last week and wowza. This place is out of where I would go to casual grab food as it is a trek for me, so I used this opportunity to try new things out of my comfort-zone. What a spread we got devour! I will note my favorites with an asterisk.  FOOD: - Hummus Dip. Made in-house and creamy fresh taste. - Smoked Eggplan. Made in-house with a Tahini paste. Wowza!  - Fried Cauliflower*. Fried with a tahini sauce. If I knew how to make this. I'd be in trouble, as I would have so much gas. SUPER delicious! - Kibbeh. Ground lamb crispy shell, filled with lamb onion mix. Filled. - Moussaka. Delicious stewed tomato with spices.  - Tabbouleh. Parsley salad with tomatoes. - Fattoush*. This is my favorite salad. Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, onion and crispy pita chips. I do not know what the reduction dressing is, but it's so delicious. - Spicy Potatoes*. Fried, cubed potatoes, tossed in spices. Again, if I knew how to make it I would be in trouble. It's so yummy, I would be as wide as I am tall and it would all be worth it. - Kafta**************. This is a mix of ground beef and lamb, grilled on a skewer. This is my favorite dish here.  - Chicken Kabab. Seasoned chicken cubes, grilled and still juicy in the center. - Beef Kabab. Seasoned beef cubes, grilled to medium-well perfection.  The skewers / kababs come with safron rice, grilled veggies on the side.  ATMOSPHERE: It's a family run restaurant. The staff is attentive and friendly. Ample parking as it is situated inside a strip mall area. Close to 485.  I will definitely come back and make the trek, it was so worth it.",

Tasty, well-seasoned chicken with creamy, smoky sauce, Lebanese pickles and crunchy lettuce, all wrapped up in a crunchy grilled wrap. The depth of flavor was much more than expected. And each sandwich was just $5.25. There is no side with it, but obviously the charge is reasonable. We also had hummus and pita. The hummus is a good portion, and topped with yummy whole chickpeas, garlic, oil and spices. Our total bill was just over 16 bucks, and well worth it. Can't wait to go back!",

I started with a Fattoush salad to start, then for my entree(actually a hot appetizer) I had the Hummus Shawarma with mixed meat(chicken, beef & lamb) with the home made pita bread and it was delicious.  Finished the dinner with a Lebanese coffee and a pie of Baklava!!!  I grew up in the Detroit area and we had plenty of good Lebanese restaurants, so I knew what I was looking or and this place did not disappoint!!!",

We were greeted and seated promptly upon arrival and our server Tristan was excellent in helping us understand the menu and making recommendations. We started the with humus which was excellent!  Will definitely start every meal with their humus and pita bread. We tried another hot appetizer which we really didn't care for ( just not our taste not restaurant fault). Tristan offered to exchange it for another selection which we did and were very pleased with or next choice. We split an entree and we were stuffed. The food and service were both excellent!  Plenty of food for the price and we will definitely be back again!  The only downside was they do not serve alcohol.   It's a small space so very intimate dining experience. Our server, Tristan, was Johnny on the spot the entire time and you could observe the other servers in close proximity were on top of their tables as well!",

It is located inside of a plaza in Matthew that I had never been to before, a pretty nice little area. The restaurant itself was very nice, very clean. It was fairly crowded the night we were there which surprised me as it was a Wednesday night. I ordered the vegetable plate with grape leaves, hummus, moujaddarah and falafel but was brought Moutabal instead. I was sad not to get to eat the falafel but didn't mention it as it really wasn't a big deal. All in all the food was delicious, it was my first experience so I have nothing to compare it to except for the hummus which was amazing! It was so delicious and fresh I could have eaten my weight in hummus easily. Our friends even placed an order to go before leaving. Definately a place worth trying.",

Whenever we visit a new restaurant that offers food from another country we always look to see if the clientele are from that country and we've never been disappointed when we see that occurring! This establishment has a very loyal following of folks from the Middle East and Lebanon and now we know why! We are still working our way through the menu and loving it! Everything we have had has been very good! We took my parents, who aren't big on anything different, but went with us and absolutley loved it and are ready to go back!

The owner Yasser always shakes your hand and welcomes you like you're family. The chefs are good and the servers are wonderful. I personally recommend Henny Danny Stefanie Ray and the one with a tattoo on her neck. Those five always have a smile on their face and continuously check you and make sure you are happy, answer all your questions and taking care of from the time you walk in until your walking out with a nice full belly. The restaurant has done a complete 360* since the first opening. So needless to say I'm a very happy customer and as well as my family. Big thanks to Yasser Henny Danny Stefanie Ray and the young lady tattoo neck also the chefs. You guys have turned this restaurant around completely and many of us are very thankful. Keep up the great work you guys. Yasser you've got yourself one amazing crew.  One happy family/customer Joe Hartsfield & Family May 21, 2014",

Salad was soaked with oil:/  the server had forgotten plates and utensils, so we waited 13 minutes for that before we started our appetizers.  Next, we finally got our food.  We questioned if it was 2 chicken kebabs or if it was something else....because both were labeled differentlt.  We questioned the server to make sure we got the right food...he actually picked up the sandwich and squeezed it with his hand....touching it.  What the heck?????!!!!! Then said oh its chicken.  At this point he was crappy towards us so I spoke up and said please make another one because u touched the sandwich with ur hands.  I mean would u eat it after it was touched?  Our adana kebab was burnt literally burnt and dry.  We were so frustrated that we didn't return it.  For four people, it was way overpriced.  We had a very unpleasant experience and will not be coming back.  Perhaps for people who don't know real Mediterranean food, this is good.  They didn't take anything off the bill, not expecting them too, but the food was way off par:/  touching the food and not offering an apology, not cool!  We prefer another hole in the wall place where the food is on point and about half the price.  First and last time eating here.",

Totally shareable and everything else- while very flavorful- will pale in comparison. It's a taste I never knew I needed in my life. If you don't it, you are missing out. Anytime I get it, the table next to us is like, \"Oooh, what's that?\" The eggplant dip was very good and so was the Tabbouleh- which we get every time and it is good as a left over when the other salad doesn't hold up as well.   Word of warning, the pita wraps are good, but have a lot of pickles. I like pickles, but it's an intense pickle experience. Get some fresh pita if you order take out. It's negligible in price and you have to ask to get the fresh stuff.   I have also never had bad service here. It get's busy, so if you are coming with a group, be prepared to wait a bit, but it's worth it.",

Every time we get the mixed grill to share (3 kebabs - 1 lamb, 1 kafta, 1 chicken served with saffron rice), the falafel appetizer and hummus. The chicken and kafta kebabs are my favorites - but the lamb is really good too (very tender). Falafel with tahini is fresh and delicious. And the hummus. Oh my. The creamiest hummus I've ever had. The portion is the size of what you buy at Harris Teeter, so you definitely get leftovers. Be sure to ask for extra pita for the next day!  Again, I love this place for takeout and only for takeout. I don't love the dining room/ambiance of the restaurant, but I'm happy to bring it home!",

We come from foodie cities (New York and Miami) so we explored the food scene here and are grateful to have this place near our home. Weve been to Kebab Je on several occassions and they never dissappoint. They are consistent with everything they do. The food is fresh and delicious and the service is fantastic. The place is well maintained, the staff are always friendly and I usually see the manager/owner well involved. You can sense passion, love and pride in their food and service. This is a special place and it has made us loyal customers.   -Do try their hummus. it is fresh and you can order \"to go\" to keep at home. Theyll throw in pita bread pieces along with it.  -Their baklavas are a perfect treat to end your meal. its small and tasty and well worth it. my fave is the pistachio baklava.   -Always include pita bread with you meal. they make it fresh, and deliver it while its still warm and puffy. Delish!  We can be very critical of a place, and explored many restaurants in Charlotte but Kebab Je are always on point and we always leave satisfied and happy. I recommend it to everyone.",

Sure the pita oven draws people in and it's great bread but the meat dishes are awful.     My kebabs... All three were burnt and dry.   The server was aloof,  and the food in the counter looks like they dumped it out of a can.   I tried the tourshe,  and it was gross.     I won't be coming back.   I prefer flavor and quality more than anything.   Prices are way off.... By at least 2$ a dish.     There was no follow up from the server after the 3 mistakes,  which makes me not want to come back ever.   I'm happy to eat elsewhere.   Unfortunately True Mediterranean is not here at this place and needs major revamping.",

We picked Kebab-Je because we were SO over the same ol' same ol' and the overflowing number of effusively positive reviews of the food & service. We are so glad we did.   First, the service really is stellar. The host/manager asked if it was our first time here, and when he found out, he sent us out complimentary samples of the chicken and beef/lamb shawarma & sauces, then sent us a complimentary plate of hummus with our falafel appetizer! He also did a robot dance for our 4 yo son, who was absolutely delighted by that. Even if the food was awful, the service was so great we'd have come back anyway. Our waitress was also super attentive & on point. Never had to ask for a refill and she brought us a kid cup of water for our son when he finished his juice, again we didn't e even need to ask.   But the food... With every bite we said OMG THIS IS AMAZING. First, the falafel: I didn't know falafel could taste this good. Ditto hummus. The tahini sauce is divine. I ordered the shawarma plate, which was incredible. The basmati rice was saffron yellow with raisins in it, delicate flavor. The grilled vegetables were seasoned with I have no idea what but perfect. My husband got the braised lamb shank and it was falling off the bone, melt in your mouth. He said to tell you all, \"THE HOOK IS OFF HERE!\" As in, it's off the hook delicious. The portions are huge. I was ravenous and couldn't eat half my plate. It's not cheap, but the price is on par with any Applebee's. The food and portions are light years better value than any such boring chain restaurant. This is clearly some nice family's pride and joy and it shows. Eat here. Luxuriate in the foodgasm to follow. It's worth it.",

I can only speak for the vegetarian food but of course there are plenty of meaty options for you carnivorous fiends. The hummus is smooth and creamy and so much tastier than anything you've tried before. Portions are pretty huge and prices are incredibly cheap for what you get. The service is personal and efficient. Overall, this little place is well organized, run with care and attention to detail. And it's yummy.",

Because I follow a somewhat healthy diet (lots of protein, nothing fried or breaded) means the abundance of Matthew's fast food restaurants is out.  I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Kabab-je for lunch today.  I ordered the Shawarma entre plate that came with saffron rice and vegetables.  My co-worker got the vegetable plate.  Both portions were HUGE.  I probably was given 8-10oz of deliciously-prepared meat/lamb.  The service was also prompt and the restaurant was clean.  I had water to drink and my bill came out to $14, a bit more than I'd like to pay for a weekday lunch.

The tabouli and spicy lentil soup were wonderful. Fried Cauliflower with tahini sauce was tasty. Chicken kababs were also good. The baklava was flaky, buttery and not too sweet.

I did when I ordered the Smoked Eggplant appetizer, you can't be let down by the quality of their food. Whether you get the assortment of kebabs, a lumbering lamb shank, a couple meat pies or a falafel sandwich, you really can't go wrong.  Also, HIGHLY recommend their Kanafeh for dessert.

The only problem I had was the lack of respect shown from the cook to the servers, I observed  him yelling at them,  and also as I was asking my server questions regarding the food,  the small cook proceeded to constantly call his name until he had to leave me for a few moments  he excused himself,  but what upset me is the fact that the cook saw him speaking to me,  I feel it would have been more appropriate to wait until he had answered all of my questions  and got my order. Still haven't  decided if I will go back.",

We stumbled upon this place after some shopping and what a great find!  They always have a crowd and I understand why....it's good.  I sit outside in the heat but the awesome staff keeps you well hydrated with their attentive friendly service and there is usually no wait.  The decor inside is cozy with a case in front showing all of the meats and desserts ....odd but forgivable.  One of my favorite appetizers is the cauliflower.  It's fried but simple and delicious.  Their hummus is super creamy and tasty.  I usually opt for the veggie platter which is 4 samples of their veggie dishes.  All are rock stars.  The lamb sausage is insanely good but honestly my absolute favorite is the smoked eggplant and a side of extra garlic...yup garlic!  It is whipped into a magically delicious creme that is out of this world.  I mean I have gone out of the way to get this simple but delicious food.  It's good.  Keep it up!",

The Eggplant El Rahib was superb! It was creamy, light, very tasty, having it with the naan bread which was hot and puffy was a perfect way to start a meal. I ordered beef Kabab in medium rare. The rice and the grilled veggies were spot on but the beef came out well done. I decided to take them as is, instead complaining. When Julia, my waitress passed by my table and asked me how the dish was, I just mentioned the beef was well done. Up to my surprise she immediately turned to the kitchen and asked the cook to grill two more beef kabab for me. This small family restaurant cares for customers and wants to provide the perfect food and great dining experience far beyond some big names. That's why their food was so good. As dessert I ordered Pistachio Baklawa. Again, it was delicious, not overly sweet like other Turkish eateries, buttery, fragrant. I had to buy a few more and carried the Styrofoam container by hand, up and down a few flights and got them to my office in NYC. My coworkers liked them very much and were amazed how a family restaurant in Charlotte could do a classic dessert better than the most of New York's. Thank you, Julia.",

I ordered the chicken schwarma and veggies, the fried cauliflower as well as the Moutabal (smoked eggplant). Having eaten a lot of Lebanese food over the years from east to west, north to south, I have an insatiable craving for certain flavor combinations and spices typically used. I found the food a little flat for my liking.  I was disappointed that the chicken was dry, the veggies were swimming in soup as if the grill was not attended to and they put a lid over warm grill top to steam the veggies. Expecting the cauliflower to pop in my mouth (spices and how its prepared), but instead it was chewy and tasteless, so I asked for more yogurt and garlic sauce to liven it up a bit. The smoked eggplant was good with good smoke flavor and the pita was fresh and warm. I believe these folks may have had a rough evening, it was packed and the waitstaff were hustling around quickly. If you ever make it to Michigan, try LaMarsa in Farmington Hills, Pita Cafe in Oakpart and everywhere in Dearborn.",

The food thus far is very delicious :) Favorite meal is the lamb kabob entree which comes out very juicy and not over cooked. Now we bring our friends here.

We started with the hummus and pita bread and it was fantastic.  Perfectly flavored, the fresh pita bread compliments the hummus wonderfully.   I am somewhat of a picky eater, so I went with the grilled chicken kabobs, fries and added grape leaves for my husband to try.  With the first bite, I knew we were in for a treat.  The chicken is hands down the best chicken dish I've ever had at a restaurant.  Perfectly seasoned, fresh and delicious.  My husband demolished his food in record time, which is always a good sign.    The atmosphere was excellent.  We loved looking in the glass cases to see the different food options and watching them fire up the pita bread before serving it.  The service was probably the best we've had at any restaurant in Charlotte!    Atmosphere  Service with a smile  Delicious food that I'll be dreaming about   Try it - you'll like it!",

    "text": "Have you ever tried Lebanese cuisine? If not you need to and the Kabab-Je Rotisserie & Grill is the place to go! When trying a new cuisine for the first time it's essential to have a knowledgeable and patient server! And we had a truly \"dynamic duo\" of Brianna S. and Henny.   We sat outside, on a beautiful PINEVILLE afternoon and experienced a culinary adventure. While perusing the outside menu, a patron began telling us why we needed to try  Kabab-Je, including a tour of the restaurant. If I didn't know better I might have thought him the owner but when I saw him eat and pay his bill....he was another happy Customer.  We started with 2 apps, the Hummus and Batista Harra (spicy potatoes). The potatoes were sauteed in garlic, coriander and chili...absolutely delicious. But the hummus stole the show! The creamiest hummus to ever past my lips. A slight splash of EVOO and a spring of mint accompanied with fresh baked warm pittas from their oven.  We both opted for a hot sandwich, my Bride chose the Chicken Shawarma and I, the Meat Shawarma sandwich. The chicken was served on a grilled pita with delightfully seasoned chicken with pickle and a flavorful garlic sauce.   My Meat was a combination of lamb/beef on a grilled pita wrapped with tomato, pickle, parsley, onion and tahini sauce. Seasoned perfectly without overpowering the meats flavor.   A word of caution: the portions are generous, so expect to take some home but be assured.....a couple of mouthful's and you want to try everything!  An additional word of caution....don't want to drive to PINEVILLE? A new location will be opening soon in the Stonecrest Shopping Center but I wouldn't hesitate to drive to Concord (from Waxhaw) for food this delicious and service which is .....OUTSTANDING!  What are you waiting for........  **Our second visit was for dinner and was as enjoyable as the first visit! I ordered the Lamb Shank served with a fresh tomato, cilantro and onion sauce. Lamb was slow roasted to fork tender and the sauce a perfect balance to the lamb.The saffron basmati rice was a bit clumpy and short on flavor.   My Bride ordered the Meat Pie (Lahem Bi Ajeen) and didn't care for it's flavor. Began our meal with the hummus and fresh baked pitas.   Our server, Tristan, did a professional job of answering our questions and was inconspicuously attentive on a beautiful Saturday evening. The Service Team\" has got their \"hummus\" together!",

From the moment we (party of three) sat down the service was top notch. We started with the hummus & pita bread and it kept coming hot and delicious. You can see the pita being made right there. I had the lamb shank comes with rice and vegetables. Amazing flavor the lamb was so tender did not need a knife (only $15.00). My two lunch companions loved their food and we all look forward to returning for more delicious food and wonderful service.",

    "text": "Holy moly, this place has been so close and I have passed it by TOO many times. First of all, we went on a Sunday afternoon - (always a tough time to get in somewhere at this hour without fighting the post-church, Sunday errands crowd). It was jam packed. There were lots of big parties waiting, so my son and I were able to sneak in and get a wee little table right in front of the door. (It was a little annoying since the main door kept opening and we'd get really drafty). That said, our server was amazing - very attentive and great with the kid (my child is 6 years old and can sometimes be finicky with food/drink choices). We ultimately got the roasted eggplant appetizer (Moutabal). That and the bread would suffice for a meal - but I ordered the Shish Tawouq as well. (My son got chicken nuggets and fries of course). Everything came out quick and was absolutely fresh. Honestly I agree with 90% of the other reviewers, there is nothing that will ever beat the super-hot, super-fresh pita that comes out pre-meal. The crowd was really impressive as the wait was overflowing out the door. The \"garlic sauce\" aka Lebneh was so crazy good - I would have devoured my kid's fries in it if I wasn't already overstuffed with my own meal. The whole ordeal cost about $30 and was well worth every penny. Honestly, I never touched the veggies or the rice that came with my Entree, so you could just plan on taking home leftovers and this place could feed you for a couple of meals.  Service was impeccable and I will definitely be back.",

I am also a lentil soup fanatic and their soup is very good. I probably would have licked the bowl if no one was looking. My husband ordered the Kafka sandwich- which is always one of his favorite Lebanese dishes. He said that the meat was very good and not dry. We took a few pieces of walnut and pistachio baklava home with us and I wish that we had ordered a few more. I love Lebanese food and get so excited when I can can find it around here. I'm just so glad that we found a new favorite spot!",

I love trying new foods so I was super excited, but nervous for my super SUPER picky eater of a boyfriend. Our server was wonderful: she asked if we had ever dined with them before or if we had ever eaten Mediterranean food before, to which we replied no and no. She gave us suggestions and even brought us samples of the shawarma before we ordered. I ended up ordering the beef/lamb shawarma, which came with rice and veggies. It was soooo delicious. We were super pleased that he could order substitutions for his veggies. He got the mixed grill kebabs with rice and spicy potatoes. We were both really pleased with our meals, and for him, that's saying a lot. Everything is so flavorful and the meat was to die for. (We're big meat eaters). I brought my leftovers to work today and it's just as good heated over! We will be returning!",

I've eaten here two times. On my first trip I had the chicken shawarma. No hot sauce (Harissa) or garlic sauce was added and it had green pickles??? And only a few pickled turnips. I've been eating Lebanese food for 25 years and I have never seen an authentic Lebanese shawarma with green pickles. Where are the onions and tomatoes? Maybe a sprinkle of Taboleh? This is trendy Americanized food. The second trip I requested my shawarma with NO green pickles. The waitress said she would ask the cook but they normally don't take special requests. Is this a Seinfeld episode? No Shawarma for Me! Also, a shawarma should be properly wrapped so that the upper cover slips off and then the lower cover can be torn away in a spiraling motion thus keeping your fingers clean. I gave them two stars because the pita was home cooked and the wait staff were polite whilst telling me to stuff it.",

From the opening in Matthews to the addition of the Rea Rd location, two things have amazingly remained consistent over the years: fabulous food and stellar service. Although I admit a particular fondness for the Matthews location, both deliver particularly wonderful kabobs, hummus, and tabouleh salad! All wonderfully authentic, fresh, and perfectly prepared always.",

The waiter raised the bar from good place to eat to memorable experience.    Brought desserts home as too full at end of meal.  They look delicious!",

The menu was more extensive than I was expecting, haven been to a number of Mediterranean places in Charlotte with limited menus. We ordered two eggplant dip appetizers, both wonderful, and the accompanying pita tasted fresh.   We ordered a mix of dishes, myself choosing a meat pita sandwich, which I found too large to finish but had good flavor and relatively fresh-tasting ingredients.   I'd give 4 stars for the food, but an overwhelming 5 for the staff's service. I'm not sure my tea ever got below half a glass without having a prompt refill.",

I have had the Lamb Shank, Vegetarian Meal, Shawarma over Rice, and plenty more. I have always been completely pleased with everything. They serve fresh, HOT Pita bread at your request.  Its totally awesome.  I recommend this place for every one. Date night, families, entertaining out of town guests.  Restaurant: Clean! Not a super large space, but that adds to the charm. Its so authentic, it is like being submerged in the culture. Management: Always present and genuinely engaged.

It was served with a huge side of fluffy pita.   The sandwich was large. The garlic sauce on it was a bit overpowering. It may have been better with a hummus or tzatziki type of sauce. My bill was around $10, and I was able to take half the food home for dinner.   Awesome. I'll be back for dinner to try more meals.",

I wish they'd give the picked veggies and olives as a garnish on the table like our favorite Middle Eastern place back in northern Jersey. My only other suggestion for improvement would actually be an expansion if possible. Kabab Je gets too crowded on certain times/on certain days. Their outdoor seating is wonderful (love the fountain view) but needs many, many more fans (the two they have aren't cutting it in this Charlotte heat). Overall, though, Kabab Je Rotisserie and Grille is absolutely awesome and I cannot wait to visit again and again. We've been eating this type of cuisine for years and had access to very authentic Israeli, Lebanese, and Palestinian food for decades (in NYC and Chicago). When we go for Middle Eastern food we always order lebneh (fresh white cheese drizzled w/ olive oil). That being said, Kabab Je's Lebne was the BEST we've ever had!! Super fresh and thick...I'm craving it now just thinking about it.",

Everything that we ordered was just amazing, loved loved loved the Albanian sausage, a bit spicy but so flavorful.   The pita bread just keeps coming and is free. Staff were also super friendly as well.   I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Not sure I can summarize all the different things I've ordered that were fantastic, but the shwarma, hummus, chicken sausage and lamb chops should not be missed. It is a bit odd to find a place this delicious deep in the suburbs, but Kabab has perfectly seasoned meats, delicious hummus and wonderful service.  I have yet to try anything that was not at least \"good\", with nearly everything being worthy of their rating. Their Yelp review is now some weird anomaly, this place is great. One of my favorite's in Charlotte.",

Huge portions, and consistently good. I normally get the chicken shawarma platter. Sometimes the chicken can be a little dry because we often dine late, but it still tastes great. I especially like the falafel and the garlic yogurt sauce. I wish there was a better use of space because the seating is tight and often there is a wait.",

So amazing, shared with my husband and a friend and they both agreed it was fantastic.   Last time I was in I took a few desserts to go to share with friends. They had a salted caramel creme brulee dessert. Wow. Pretty sweet to eat the whole thing by yourself but so delicious that I managed on my own.   This is definitely one of my local favorites!",

Needless to say, (and I'm saying it anyway) we were seated immediately.  What I believe was the owner and another waiter pulled out our chairs for us to sit down.  Uh, a million points for that.    The atmosphere is nice and it's open.  You purposely see your meal being prepared as opposed to being seated at a kitchen entrance where you aren't meant to see, hear, smell your food until it's placed in front of you, but unfortunately (in most cases) you do.  I had the lamb sandwich wrap thing and my friend ordered the falafel wrap.  I tried hers and it was very good.  It was fresh and distinct in flavors.  My wrap was great except for the lamb.  It tasted as if it had been frozen and seemed a bit on the fatty side.  So, bummer.  However, I want to go back for dinner and try their kabobs and all that other jazz.  Hopefully, that'll bump them up a star or two.  Definitely will return and get the full experience.",
