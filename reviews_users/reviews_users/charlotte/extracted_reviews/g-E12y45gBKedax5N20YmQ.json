    "text": "We stopped by The Burrito Factory for lunch based on all the reviews we read. I got one each of the fish, chicken, & steak tacos. The fish tacos aren't part of the Taco Tuesday deal, but I still wanted to try it. I have to say it was my favorite. The spicy chicken was not spicy at all. The steak taco wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected & had a strong flavor of I believe cilantro (but I could be wrong in that). I topped my tacos with guacamole, pico de gallo, & sour cream. I did like the green & orange sauces I received to go on the tacos. All of the staff were friendly and there was no wait time. I'm giving 4 stars because although not as flavorful as I expected the tacos weren't terrible and I would return to try out one of the burritos.",

    "text": "Whaat? Where have you been the last 17 years, Burrito Factory and why didn't you send a tweet/carrier pigeon/smoke signal when you opened? My husband and I ventured down South on a grey Sunday, but it was all smiles and sunshine in the Burrito Factory. The owner was super friendly and walked us through the whole menu and told us his story (we asked).   I was so excited to not only have a place with several delicious homemade salsas - some without Cilantro - HALLELUJAH!!, but also California style burritos that as far as I know aren't anywhere else in town. For me, the most exciting thing was that they had Sopes. Not sopa (soup) but Sopes, which is kind of like an ultra thick corn tortilla fried which is used as a base like a tostada. It's only made in certain parts of Mexico, so until now, most of the Mexicans who owned restaurants in Charlotte were from non-sopes territory apparently. At the factory, they top their sopes with spiced pulled chicken on top of the beans and I usually like mine with ground beef, but they're so nice I'm sure they'd customize. They also had a number of really good looking salads that I will definitely try. Even their chips are delicious, and their tomatillo salsa and an orange creamy chipotle sauce is to die for.   In addition, they had flavored waters (like uncarbonated soda) and the pina colada was really delicious. We got a horchata to go as a dessert. :)  It's exactly what you want a burrito place to be - fresh ingredients, unique combinations, great salsas, fair prices and delicious salsas. Perfecto! My only complaint is its location, but word on the street is they're looking into a location somewhere closer to uptown (Dilworth maybe)? Can't wait!",

They don't have hardshell tacos so I ordered a softshell taco with fish and lettuce and tomato jalapeno sauce, and a few other toppings.

    "text": "After just moving here from the west coast, my husband and I havr been in desperate need of a good hand-held burrito joint. He's from San Diego, and we are both rediculously picky when it comes to mexican food. So, we were very excited after ready all the great reviews on yelp. Unfortunately,  we were both extremely disappointed. I give it a two star because I'd be willing to give it another chance, but it'll be a while. If I were asked \"Do you want to go to Taco Bell or The Burrito Factory\" I'd ask, \"Which is closer?\"  I'm a sucker for little \"whole in the wall\" joints so the decor and the location didn't bother me. But I was immediately turned off by the way you order. I thought if you ordered a burrito it would just come with everything on it that was listed, but it's just a typical conveyer belt like ordering counter. You have to ask for all the toppings individually. It also set me off that the only types of cheese they have are, feta, mozzarella, and nacho cheese sauce? How is this an \"authentic californoa burrito\" without jack or cojita cheese?   After my confusion at the counter, I finally got my bean, rice, and cheese burrito. Meh! That's it. Absolutely no flavor with the rice or beans, and the tortillas aren't fresh. I thought the only saving grace would be the salsa bar, but each salsa was just as bland as the next. They had no flavor, and no spice. What's the point of having a salsa bar if they all taste the same?   My husband got the tofu burrito (we are both vegetarian), and it was the worst cooked tofu we've ever had. If you are vegetarian DO NOT get the tofu burrito, it is wet and slimy. Terrible texture, and as bland as the rest of the meal.   I'm willing to give this place another shot based on all the amazing reviews, but I have a feeling this is not a good place for a vegetarian. Even with all the veggie options, it's not worth it. If the rice and beans are flavorless, even if I order another dish I'm worried it's not going to get better.   This place might have great meat dishes, but based on the flavor and quality of ingredients, this is in NO WAY \"California style burritos\". This is just another americanized, bland, burrito joint. Nothing special.",

Ok, give me several minutes to go find that size souffle cup, wait you need a lid? Let me wander off again to go get that. Before they had a salsa bar. Now, they gave one cup half full for my daughter and I to share. You need two salsas? Yes, one for each of us please. Thanks for the cold, runny cheese dip by the way.

The food is solid and it's certainly better than most burrito options in Charlotte but it's not as good as I was expecting based on the reviews.  You get a lot of food for your money here and for the most part, I enjoyed my burrito. However, I wasn't crazy about a lot of the sauce and salsa options and that's an important part of a burrito. They have several different hot sauces so I was initially pretty excited when I saw the salsa bar but I had trouble finding one I really liked. They all had a strange creamy taste to them and none of them were really spicy. The habanero one is the best (you have to ask for this one) but I've had better habanero sauces before. The spicy chicken on my burrito was fresh tasting and tender but it also was over salted.  In summary, it's a good place to go if you're craving a burrito but I'm not sure it lives up to the five star ratings I keep seeing.",

I needed food fast, safe food that wouldn't haunt me in the morning. Pickings in the area seemed scarce.  When, 'lo, a burrito champion revealed itself for the win.   I had a delicious chicken burrito with black beans and guacamole. It was fat; I was happy. My only disappointment were the lackluster chips. I have been spoiled by the variety found in wheat chips, and TBF's were just too plain jane.   But, what made TBF such a pleasant discovery still was that, despite it being late and there being only two customers, service was beyond exceptional in this rundown stripmall location.  I was greeted upon entering, and offered a taste of a curried chicken they were featuring. Delicious. The hospitality, warmth, kindness I found in TBF, not to mention the cleanliness and presentation of what is otherwise a fast-food joint, bumped them from an a-ok to man! I want another the next time I'm in town. They even have Jarritos, my non-alcoholic comfort drink during hard times.   I left calm and content, ready for the next day's intensity.",

I was in the area a couple of weeks ago and thanks to my yelp app, I saw that BF was literally a hop, skip and jump from my location. I went in and noticed that the place was empty which may have had something to do with the fact that they had a sign posted on the door stating their A/C was down (mind you, this was during one of our heat wave weeks). I looked at the menu really quickly and decided to go with the juicy chicken burrito.  What I immediately found odd was that I couldn't see any of the ingredients. I had to rely on the list that was posted on the plexi glass in front. Maybe they were keeping the ingredients covered due to the inside conditions (no A/C and all) but I was really turned off by that. I like to be able to see what I'm choosing! The guy who was working behind the counter was very friendly and made sure that I was aware of all my meal and sides options.  However, I wasn't all that satisfied with the taste of the burrito. I couldn't place the whether the 'different' taste I experienced was in the tortilla or rice but I was not a fan. I am more than willing to give this place another try and will probably stick with the tacos on my next go-round.",

I actually checked its reviews on Yelp which helped solidify my decision to check it out after a long and painful meeting at my credit union.  Anyway, I got the chicken curry burrito and a fish taco, and my girlfriend got two veggie tacos and an order of fried plaintains.  I got a normal fountain drink and she got horchata which I took a sip of and it was quite tasty.  My burrito was excellent.  They have a ton of options to add, so I tried pickled red onions, hot salsa, shredded cheese, iceberg lettuce, and diced hot peppers (not sure which kind of pepper, coloring seemed like a mix of jalapenos and Thai chiles) to go along with the curry chicken, black beans, and (delicious) seasoned rice that came standard.  On the fish taco I got some more of the diced hot peppers, raw red onion, hot salsa, corn, and diced cucumber.  Both the burrito and the taco were delicious.  I was shocked that I actually even preferred the taco, which surprised me because it contained tilapia, which is a relatively bland fish, but everything else I added worked perfectly with the well-cooked, tender fish.  The burrito was also excellent but I ate the taco first and had a hard time finishing it because it's very large - think Qdoba-sized.  I really appreciated how they briefly pressed it in the tortilla steamer which helped keep it coherent and added a slight bit of crispness.  Their prices are very reasonable and we will certainly be back.  The only thing that detracted from the experience (but not so much as to knock it down from a 5-star rating) was the ordering process, which was a bit chaotic as they had two line workers handing off between helping us and preparing takeout orders so it could be a little confusing at times.  The gentleman working the register was very courteous and warmly greeted everyone who walked through the door.  Overall it was fantastic and I can't wait to get back.",

I ordered the \"Bambas\" salad but then was basically asked to assemble my own salad, instead of them just putting together the pre-designed salad written on the board.  The tofu had a weird seasoning, and gross slightly-luke-warm temperature.    If I got a burrito I would obvi be more satisfied, but the line moved so slowly that I don't think my rating would have been much higher.    Bottom line: burrito or bust, and be prepared to wait!",

    "text": "I literally signed up for Yelp just to review this place, because I was so disappointed and am hoping for answers from the establishment. The employees were very friendly - although overwhelmed, and the one salsa available at the \"salsa bar\" wasn't terrible. Because of the food though, this place deserves a 1.   I'd been so excited to try this place forever - I always drive by it. Today I saw a \"tacos 1$ Tuesday\" sign and decided it was the day. I stood in line, got my food, and the result was underwhelming to say the least. I am so saddened by the food, I don't understand how the reviews are so positive! Maybe it was an off day, I don't know.   The vegetables (pico de Gallo and corn) were fresh but not ripe enough, aka pretty tasteless. I ordered two bean and veggie tacos, and was charged full price as \"veggie tacos are not part of the deal.\" This didn't make sense to me, considering meat is more expensive than some lettuce and corn. It would've been nice to have a note or a warning made b4 I chose that option. Just a note, because overall the employees were super friendly and made the visit almost worth it.   I also got a salad with chicken, and to my horror, apparently the only option is shredded chicken? Like the oily, putrid lunch meat shredded chicken in greasy red tasteless oil. Is there an option for grilled chicken?   Thirdly, the salsa bar was non existent.   I ended up eating my non-grilled, cold tacos out of starvation and trying to pick at lettuce from my disappointing salad. (It should be noted, the shredded chicken meat was so foul and so mixed in that the taste permeated the entire salad and I had to throw it away. I couldn't eat any of the veggies without tasting foul chicken.)  I hope to try this place again and see if it's better. At the moment though I really feel cheated out of my $.   Sorry, Burrito Factory. I wish I would've enjoyed it. I've eaten at Mexican and South American and Central American joints all over Charlotte and beyond. I love everything from Qdoba to Sabor to authentic food trucks on the side of the S Blvd. My family even owned a popular Latin restaurant here b4 selling it to retire.   So, I don't know what palette Burrito Factory is catering to, but if you tend to like authentic and tasty burritos or tacos... or yummy taco salads, this isn't the place :( .",

The rice is not seasoned and it should be because the majority of the burrito is rice. They are very sparing with the beans and the chicken.   Last time we ordered from them (estimated wait time of 30-40 minutes) the driver called 50 minutes after placing our order to say he couldn't find the address in his GPS and was still at the restaurant. When he finally did arrive the cheese fries we had ordered were cold and the queso was congealed.",

When we first drove by (had to do a U-Turn) it appeared they were closed as I didn't see anyone in the parking lot.  Once we got there the parking lot was definitely empty but the sign said open.  Once we arrived inside this local place I was impressed with the customer service we received.  These people are very friendly and we had the pleasure to get to know the manger on duty Issac.  Such as great guy and was really interested in hearing about our experience as well as information regarding Yelp.  We probably had a 10 min conversation discussing YELP alone which we always are gratefully to give our experiences since we have the BEST YELP ambassador in Asheville (Kipper !!!!)  Onto the meal as that is what you want to hear about right?  My wife was looking for a Gluten Free (GF) meal but had nothing on the board labeled as such...BUT they accommodated her by making her a bowl with the ingredients she chose.  This made her very happy.  HAPPY wife = Happy LIFE.  I chose the steak burrito since they were out of tamales which I was really craving but they were out.  HOPEFULLY on my next trip they will have these for me to try!.  The meat was tender and all of the ingredients including the rice were on point.  The habanero sauce was a nice touch of heat.  We also had chips and queso which were yummy.  My only wish was this was about $1-$1.50 cheaper per item which would really make this 5 stars in my book.  Great place give it a try you will be glad you did and support the locals!",

They don't have anything labelled Gluten Free (GF).  When I asked, they were more than happy to accomodate.  They made me a bowl, a steak burrito without the tortilla, not on the menu.

They are SO nice and you can tell that they LOVE what they do and that they LOVE their food. What's NOT to love about a big burrito with very fresh ingredients that YOU choose! They'll make anything you want and the way you want it. No skimping here!  Not the fanciest place, but you get one HELL of a deal always served with a super friendly face, with yummy food. Doesn't get much better than that! People are really starting to discover this place so you may expect waits at peak times. Highly recommended!",

The prices are OK, the food is OK, the service is wonderful, the environment not the greatest to look at. So, yeah..pretty much not a charmer. However, I am still interested to see how the $1 Taco night are. So, I will be returning on a Tuesday night and maybe I might change my mind and add or possibly even reduce the rating by a star. But one thing is clear, the owners or if they are not the owners and rather workers, are def. trying their best and are super friendly.",

This place stands out on South Blvd where there is a surplus of Tex-Mex and California style food establishments. This is a usual quick lunch spot for me. On Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos and they have a massive burrito which will rival any Moe's or Qudoba burrito. Unlike chain restaurants The Burrito Factory actually sells fish and tofu, plus different types of tortillas. The salsa bar here is 2nd to none in Charlotte, The downfall about The Burrito Factory is that their chips are harder than what I'm sure anyone is use to, though they may pile them up with whatever you order they should really work on that recipe.  The Manager/Owner is very cool and hip to what's going on. Overall if your looking for a Big Ass Burrito at a great price and your on the South side of Charlotte you have to stop by The Burrito Factory.",

Although the outside is somewhat blah, the interior is clean and designed with a somewhat trendy feel & TV for your enjoyment. Upon arrival, we were a little confused at the layout, where to order (being the only ones there), but was questioned by the cook  who stepped out behind the counter. We ordered one chicken burrito & one chicken quesadilla w/ chips & guacamole. Being there is only one cook, things do move a little slow, but everything is fresh & you select you additional items from behind the counter, that included cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, onions, etc. We paid and hit the salsa bar, which offered a variety of flavors. Although others Yelpers enjoyed, we thought some were a little too hot, too bland, etc. nothing seemed to hit the perfect mark. And, the soda machine offered no ice, so the owner/manger took our cups to the back to fill with ice, strange.  However, the food & chips arrived fresh, hot and were delicious. The chicken burrito had rice & beans, along with the additions and was great. The chicken quesadilla was just as good. Both fresh chicken, great rice & beans! I did enjoy the guacamole, but do wish I enjoyed the salsa as much.   I would love to give them a 3.5, but that is not an option. I will be back, knowing how things work, but recommend to those first timers, don't be in a rush & try everything..",

Instead we get The Burrito Factory. I usually select local, one-store, type businesses over the chain ones for two reasons, to support local business and because they are usually fresher, better and made with more love than those chain factories.  Unfortunately, The Burrito Factory didn't have that local feeling I was looking for. Now, their food is NOT bad by any stretch of the imagination. But there really wasn't any real flavor or soul to speak of. My burrito was very bland despite the fact that I added nearly everything they had to offer. My mother ordered a couple of tamales and they literally just plop two tamales on a place and put some weird cheese-base sauce over them. Nothing else... That's not how you serve tamales.  The day we went they had a local Latin radio station truck outside, which is how we noticed the place and decided to stop. Unfortunately, aside from what looked like an excessive number of servers and what I think was one of the owners and his buddies, there was nobody there but us.   Their menu is simple and has some good offers. One of the cool features is their salsa bar, which has some very unique salsas you usually don't see anywhere else.  Not a bad place to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",

Salsa bar was a nice touch but for me the only one that had any flavour was the factory hot. Habanero I believe. Even for a seaoned chili head I will give warning- take it slow. Ordered a bit too much on my burrito which I was warned of, caution to the wind I said!! Still great taste even if my eyes were watering :)  The food could use a bit more flavour but at it's price point I'm not complaining. BTW, the manager or owner-not sure is very friendly and helpful. I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Really surprised at how nice this place was. I expected a dump and got a very pleasant first impression. Inside looks a lot like Chipotle, although nothing will ever beat Chipotle's burritos in my very biased mind. They had interesting toppings so you can choose a Mexican or American style wrap. Their salsa bar was cool, although I didn't really care for any of their salsas. I think one of them was actually a little rancid but it didn't turn me off to the experience as a whole for some reason. I got the chicken burrito special which came with chips for only $4.99. Can't beat that! Will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Great FRESH Mexican food.   We ordered the curry chicken burrito (special for 4.99) and the shrimp burrito (8.49). You pick your toppings from the back side of the glass counter (like Chipotle, Salsarita's and Qdoba). It's a tiny place with small trays of toppings. They had fresh and pickled jalapenos, fresh guacamole and a few basic burrito fillers. Unlike most chains, they serve Tilapia, shrimp and tofu. You also have the choice of wheat OR flour tortilla. We were told that soon quinoa will be on the menu.    Pro's: fresh ingredients, lots of flavor, assorted salsas at the salsa bar, good value, friendly service, healthy choices (tofu and wheat tortillas). They serve burritos, tacos, salads and quesadillas. Kid's menu too.   Con's: One person working the counter (don't go if you are in a hurry), chips were thick and a little stale.   I would have given them a 5 if their chips were better, the serving size was a little bigger and the service was faster.  They just opened and will have some teething pains. I hope they make it.  Comparisons  Salsarita's = TBF had fewer choices but the food tasted better with the exception of the chips. Wish they had fajita veggies.  Love the fresh jalapenos.   Chipotle = Same as above. Service was WAY BETTER than Chipotle. TBF had smaller portions. TBF has queso and Chipotle does not.   Phat Burrito = TBF has more flavor and a more interesting menu. About the same interior size but no awkward line out the door like PB. TBF has more windows and feels cleaner. Salsa bar is better too.",

A shining star in a desert of Central American \"burrito special with rice and beans for $5.95\" restaurants.  A bit like the Californian burrito joints that have gone mainstream like Chipotle and Moe's, BF has a menu board of various meats and recipes already put together, but this is America and if you want to add or remove, you go right ahead.  I opted for the Curry Chicken Burrito and asked for extra tomatoes and onions. It was extremely tasty. For my wife, I got their veggie burrito with extra cilantro and she absolutely loved it.  Chips were great - maybe a little thicker than I like. Salsa bar was decent. The pico de gallo was really great - not hot at all. Yum.  I wish this place every success!",

Tuesday is 99 cent day Thursday is One Price day $7.49 (I believe)   The different sauce that you can get with your meal are great. From mild to hot.

The chips were also pretty flavorless.  I don't know what everyone else is eating here, but it can't possibly be what we ate. Hard pass indefinitely...

Okay so I do have more to say, but that pretty much does sum up my relationship with Burrito Factory.   I, like many, first stumbled upon Burrito Factory through yelp and also because of their, wait for it, $1 Taco Tuesdays!! That's right. ONE DOLLAR. With that dollar, you get the most seasoned and flavorful meat I've ever had in a taco (choice of chicken, ground beef or pulled pork - YES to all) and a hearty serving of chips. You also get over 20 different ingredients at your fingertips. Mine are always filled with lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, onions, cucumber, corn, feta, pico de gallo, habanero sauce, fresh jalapenos and pickled jalapenos. I like it HOT! Guacamole and queso are available for a small charge. I recommend queso. Always queso. ALWAYS. Also, on Thursdays, EVERYTHING on the menu is $5.49!   So what has kept me coming back (basically twice and week.. And way more than I'd really like to admit)? Well aside from the food, of course, the people are some of the sweetest I have ever met. I'm actually writing this review because we've reached this comfortable, embarrassing zone of our relationship where the employees recognize me. Today, one of them asked why don't I just start working at Burrito Factory since I'm always here (see.. embarrassing). Well, Burrito Man, that would just be feeding an addiction that I'm already having trouble quitting! Plus, I don't see how that is a good business choice on your behalf, as I would eat everything I touch.   Can this place get any more magical, you ask? Why yes. Yes, it absolutely can, because they have a SALSA BAR. Made fresh every day and filled with a variety of yummy deliciousness! I always mix the pico de gallo with the green sauce (properly named as the tomatillo mild) and that is my happy place. The first time I came here, I tried every single sauce that they have. One was out and one of their employees actually SAW that I didn't get that one, brought it from the back and to my table, without me ever saying a word! Mind you, this isn't a full service type place. It's casual. It's fun. It's delicious.   Basically, I will probably keep coming here every Tuesday for the rest of life.   Recommendations 1. Taco Tuesday 2. Nachos with Pork 3. Cali Style Chipotle Shrimp Burrito",

I have been here (or taken out) food a few times. The tacos are great and are a buck a piece on Tuesdays. I have also had the burritos, which are about the size of my head and have the same density as a brick. Also the meals come with chips and access to a salsa bar. Everything I have had is fresh and you really get a good bang for your buck.   The decor is pretty simple and nothing to really write home about. Either way, it gets the job done. Also the few times I have been the staff always seems a bit overworked. However, it was never enough to keep me from coming back. Keep up the great work churning out awesome food!",

I recommend this place to all my friends looking for a quick, affordable, somewhat healthy choice for lunch lol.",

If you like burritos, you need to come here. They give you fat burritos that are jam packed with goods. Got the price it's an amazing deal.   Tacos are also good but if I had to choose, I would go with the burritos. I strongly recommend the fried plantains as well. They taste authentic. They don't mess with it, it's just fried and served.",

Very affordable, with a $4.99 special every day, and $0.99 taco Tuesday.  I recommend the Cali chicken curry burrito, AMAZING!  This place puts Moe's and Chipotle to shame, they don't even hold a candle to one of these burritos.  I honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to eat another burrito from one of those chains again because it just won't compare and it'll be more expensive.",

Sour cream and guacamole are extra. Queso dip with chips and the slightly spicy special (orange) sauce are a must.  The service here is much friendlier than it necessary for such a solid deal on tacos. I've enjoyed a hearty burrito here in the past, but find that I don't veer to far from my spicy chicken tacos these days. Only thing I would change would be to use a different serving utensil for the meats so that you wouldn't have any residual liquid poured into the taco, as it makes it a bit messy. Really though, this place has it dialed in for a good Tuesday lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Finally got to try the Burrito Factory for the first time the other day.... I see why people rave about it now.  For a [Taco] Tuesday, they had a steady flow of customers, but never really a huge line out the door, unlike some other (cough, cough) places.  99 cent tacos only applies to chicken, pork, or beef tacos, but I had a regular priced fish taco that was super tasty.  Also tried the chorizo queso dip with chips... I can probably eat through a bucket of that stuff and die a happy person.... just don't open up the coffin anytime soon...  The restaurant itself is nothing glitzy... the focus is on tasty food that only sticks around a little bit cause people keep consuming it so fast.  I want to say the place has the bones of a Long John Silvers or Captain D's... but they've painted away the blue and white with black and gray.  A few tables can be pushed together to accommodate large groups, but probably only 1 or 2 large groups.  I noticed some extra chairs stacked on the side, so it's a bit of a free for all in the dining area.    The staffers are super nice and want to make sure you have the best experience possible. We got there at 8pm... and totally forgot it closed at 9pm.  They didn't rush us out or anything... so we only really \"got it\" when we were the last ones there after a mass exodus to the doors.  I'm sure they were tired from all the tacos they had been slinging all day long....  I need to come back and try other stuff on their menu... what I tasted so far was really great.",

The employees were pleasant and served everyone as quickly as possible without making you feel rushed to choose the variety of toppings.   I ordered three tacos (2 spicy chicken, 1 beef) and I was pleased to learn that I was supplied with a nice amount of meat on all three. I also appreciated that the meat remained covered until someone wanted it (it's the little things, that make my tummy smile).   The food was good and filling. The only missing was a side of salsa for the chops that came with it. I will definitely be returning to try a burrito in the [near] future.",

Decided to order in spanish. They could barely hear me due to the loud music.  Got to the register, and paid $15 for 3 tacos, chips & guacamole and a soda. Like whatttttttt!!  I wouldn't complain, if the food was at least edible.  The presentation was nice but my steak tacos lacked flavor, were super wet and cold. ... the guac had absolutely no flavor. . & the chips, well they wrre soggy. . Couldn't even finish . It wasn't even worth it .",

There may be a long line but they are very time efficient and it usually goes pretty fast. It's set up like a taco buffet, two things I cannot resist! They have every topping you can think of and the choice of chicken, spicy chicken, pork, or beef-all delicious. Your tacos come with chips so no need to order extra! The size of the tacos may seem small,  but don't be fooled, once you have the toppings and chips, you will be more than satisfied! I have not tried anything other than the taco Tuesday deal but the whole menu looks really good and definitely worth trying!   The staff are sooo friendly, especially the first guy you hit who asks how many tacos you want. He is constantly smiling and can't help but put a smile on your face too.

The most important part is the food though.... and it was good enough to go back again.  I had the California wet burrito - which means it has cheese sauce and French fries on it as well as your choice of protein.  It was filling and I left happy.    My biggest complaint is that the French fries weren't crisp - they had sat for too long on the fryer.",

    "text": "After having this joint bookmarked for months, my wife and I finally decided this was the perfect Friday night to venture down South Blvd and see what the hype was alllll about.   I opted for the fajita veggie burrito with steak. Plenty of options for toppings, all of which looked fresh to death. Also decided to give the chorizo queso a spin. The best part of the Burrito Factory experience? SALSA BAR! This is without a doubt the best salsa bar in charlotte (sorry all of you Sabor lovers, don't hate me). The green salsa was my overall winner, but you can't go wrong with any of them. The steak on the burrito was cooked to perfection and had a great carne asada flavor. I think the chorizo queso might have been the real MVP of the night, though. The perfect blend of cheese/chorizo with the perfect amount of spice. I'd endure the 50 million stop lights down South Blvd on the reg just to get that queso.   Pro tip: all burritos/tacos come with chips. Perfect way to try all of the sauces.",

    "text": "In a former life, I lived near Montford and I would drive past this place all the time without giving it a second thought. Thank God for Yelp. 4.5 stars strong? I had to come see what all the fuss is about.  Dollar tacos on Tuesdays? Yes please! They do beef, pork, and chicken options for the special. I went with two spicy chicken and a beef. Sidenote: the woman in front of me got a salad. Listen honey, you're doing Tuesdays wrong. I love the long laundry list of toppings you can choose from here. I can't really think of anyone else who does this. I was really impressed by the size of the tacos. At a lot of places, a Taco Tuesday special is pretty skimpy. Not here. My tacos were loaded.   Another bonus: THEY HAVE A SALSA BAR!! You know my motto, all places should have a salsa bar. Hell, I would put one in my living room if my roommate would let me. Wonder what she would do if she came home one night to find a salsa bar in place of the coffee table? My tacos came with free chips, so I was super happy to try #allthesauces.   It was pretty warm in there for lunch, but it was 103 degrees outside. Every place in Charlotte is warm right now in this heatwave. I didn't mind it a bit. I enjoyed eating my lunch alone and watching all the action in the restaurant. All the workers were really nice. There was a pretty steady stream of people coming in and out for lunch.   I don't live near here anymore, but I will definitely be coming back. It's well worth the drive. My only regret is that I never gave this place a chance sooner. However, that may be a good thing or else I would weigh 300 pounds.  Kudos, Burrito Factory. I really dig what you guys are doing here.",

On the recommendation from a few awesome fellow Yelpers, my husband and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  First thing I noticed when walking in is the salsa bar! Salsa bars rock!  There are few tables in there. We ate in but I got the impression most people ordered to go.   We decided to split the California fish burrito and a side of chips and queso. I was a little nervous at first cause it took a little time to get the burrito together....what i didnt realize was it was becuase they were frying the plaintains on the spot!! The burrito was ginormo (thank gosh we split it cause i was full for like 8 hours after!) and had rice, beans (half black, half pinto), tilapia, pico, and plaintains. Super messy, yet super delish! The queso was that white queso and was really good. I love me some queso!   Good thing for me is that soon we are moving really close to th Burrito Factory......bad thing for my workouts cause Im gonna have to amp them up to compensate for discovering this place!",

I took that chance to get both a big chicken and cheese quesadilla and big meaty burrito.  Both came with chips.  The chips were good but the salsa bar was of the refridgerated variety.  While that's obviously good toward keeping things fresh, the problem was everything was so near the freezing point that you couldn't each your chips with salsa.  The excellent queso stepped in for a save.  The two entrees were bland and the seating area left much to be desired.  All in all, it's not bad but not so good as I'd want to return.  It's a home grown effort with out the million dollar budget chain restaurants use to get the details right, I know.  It's when a small mom and pop's joint still manages to get the details worked out, you have found a winner.",

    "text": "Had the pleasure of eating my first Shrimp Burrito at the Burrito Factory (BF) - incredible!  As a recent transplant from Arizona, I've been on the search for GREAT Mexican flavors, and the Burrito Factory has it.  The chicken and steak are very good, and the shrimp is cooked to order in a wonderful chipotle sauce.  Featured are the typical fillers of a Quoda and Chipotle - black/pinto beans, rice, pico, guacamole - but BF takes it to a whole-nother level with 2 choices of fresh cheese, fresh chopped cilantro and jalapenos, and other sides you won't find at the chain restaurants.  To compare with other very good fresh burrito/Mexican flavors in town (Phat Burrito and Cabo Fish Taco), BF sets itself apart with a well-balanced mix of authentic Mexican spices/flavors.  To top it off, you get a generous portion of homemade corn tortilla chips and access to a FREE homemade salsa bar.  The salsas attest to the skill and authenticity of the staff, showcasing a wonderful bouquet of roasted peppers, onions, and spices.  The inside decor is every bit as clean and sleek as a Chipotle with the simple casualness of a real California-Style burrito joint.  Also, the staff is friendly and helpful.  BF gets a 4 out of 5 for excellently prepared food, great flavors, and a level of authenticity that simply can't be found in other fast-food burrito joints in town.  If you have an adventurous palate or are looking to experience True Mexican flavors, the Burrito Factory is a must eat in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Okay so I'm conflicted about Burrito Factory. I'd probably give 3.5 stars if that was an option but it's not so I'm sticking with 3. There are a few things on this menu that I'd give a higher rating to. The nachos for example I really love. You can put basically anything you want on them to build your own and that's awesome!! The burritos are okay. We've tried the steak fajita, the chicken, and the california wet burritos. The first two lacked any kind of real flavor. No spices or salt or anything else appeared to have been used. However these burritos are packed full of ingredients and they don't skimp. The California wet burrito is better but again just okay. They give you salsa, and they have these other sauces. The orangeish looking sauce is my boyfriends favorite. He always wants me to order extra extra of that stuff as he can't get enough. It will save the burritos lol!! The plantains are good (hard to mess that up) and the queso is good but could use jalapenos in my opinion. We order delivery from them frequently and the poor delivery guy apparently has issues. He's really nice but sometimes I feel like he lacks awareness. He's delivered to us like 4 maybe 5 times and he still calls to ask exactly where our complex is because it doesn't show up on his GPS. I really am going to need him to update his GPS or use google maps!! However our food still always arrives pretty hot so that's a plus, the negative is my sour cream arrived melted into a soup so I just don't order it anymore lol. This place is a convenience factor for us so we'll probably continue ordering from here on occasion. I feel like if a few kinks were worked out this place could really shine.",

    "text": "Just moved to the neighborhood, saw this place was well reviewed and tried it.  I am not entirely sure I can eat Mexican food anywhere else now.  Let's start with Taco Tuesday. I have a favorite Latin street food place in Charlotte that has $1 tacos on Tuesday, too, and as another reviewer said, you can tell they're $1 tacos. Not Burrito Factory, nope. They give you the same tacos as any day of the week. Beef, chicken or pork, lettuce, queso blanco and the freshest pico around. And chips.  For like $.50 you can get salsa with it. I don't know about you, but a meal like that is a good value. A meal as DELICIOUS as that for less than $5? Amazing.   The tacos at Burrito Factory are so good, it's hard to get anything else. But the name isn't Taco Factory, so I highly encourage you to try their burritos. We've had four varieties so far and can tell you the California Wet Burrito is our favorite. It's CRAZY BIG, though, so expect to have some for leftovers.   Their guacamole is as good as the table-side fresh-made guac at expensive restaurants. And their salsa...HOLY CROW IS IT AMAZING. My favorite is the guajillo, husband loves the tomatillo, and we both enjoy the habenero, but it is genuinely hot. Like, make sure you have something to drink nearby hot.   We are still working our way through the menu, but I have to tell you you will be hard pressed to find better food, greater quality and nicer people than at the Burrito Factory. Give them a try.",

    "text": "I've driven past this place tons of times. I made a mental note to check it out, after I saw the yelp reviews.   Ambience: The restaurant is off South Blvd and Archdale, but very easy to miss. Walking in I was happy to see that the place was clean. There are 7 or so tables. No frills, just a simple layout. The health score was a 96 (A).   Food: The menu had something for everyone. Beef, chicken, tofu, shrimp and fish. There are a couple burrito styles. They offer nachos, tacos, and quesadillas, as well as salads. I opted for the Cali wet burrito, subbing shrimp for the ground beef (meat, queso, beans rice, pico and FRIES!). Since I got shrimp, they were cooked fresh to order. This made the wait time a little longer, but I'm fine with that. The burrito was HUGE! Stuffed! I added cilantro, guac and extra cheese. My bf got the veggie burrito, the squash and zucchini were sauteed to order.  The only reason I docked a star was the stale chips, ugh.  Service: There was one man working, he was very pleasant. He did well juggling cooking our food and filling other orders. He was a little slow moving. But it was a Sunday and we were in no hurry.   All in all, we'll definitely be back. $20 for a filling meal, drinks included. I could only finish half of my burrito.",

They come with lettuce cheese and pico now which is good but any additional topping is extra. It use to be only sour cream and guacamole extra.... but I like traditional tacos with cilantro and onion so will opt for the way it's severed vs paying extra for each topping.   Overall I'm disappointed in there Tuesday taco menu, as service seemed to drop last time we were there. However, don't get me wrong. Their queso was still on point and they serve free chips with your order. I guess you can't beat that.",

You are able to choose from a variety of toppings such as lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, onions / peppers, and hot sauce. Now my husband always goes for the hottest sauce restaurants have, and this one was his favorite! Towards the bottom of the burrito he actually started getting red in the face .  Then, they hot press your burrito so that it stays together and nothing falls out. Huge plus! When we checked out they gave us chips with both of our burritos! Chips included.... what?!

I remembered coming across this place a while ago but by the time I got there it was closed! This time I picked a way earlier time and I was ridiculously happy. I went with the Burrito Al Pastor. It was supposed to have pork and all the fixings like guacamole, sour cream, rice, beans and cheese. They actually didn't have guacamole this time which was a bummer but the man making it offered to slice up and avocado and put the slices on it so of course I obliged. Might I add his cutting skills were A1! I asked him if he could cut it in half so I can take a pic and he was delighted to do so. He even helped me style the food so I can get my foodie fix! He was great! The food is not only great but the prices are super fair so yes I'd recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "The food here is delicious! Always on the lookout for a good shrimp burrito my partner suggested we stop here before heading back to Atlanta. We both grew up in the West/Southwest and know what Mexican food should taste like.   She loved her shrimp burrito! She was still talking about it when we drove away. The secret ingredient seems to be their yummy chipotle sauce.   I'm a vegetarian so I was glad they had the tofu burrito. The rice in my burrito was perfect! It took me back to the days when I would sit at my neighbor's table and she would say \"Here mijita, have some rice\". Like home cookin. Yum!  Also, the creamy red salsa and creamy green salsa are on point!   I had one of those Jarrito (pineapple) sodas I used to love way back when and I was in heaven. Our meals were tasty and filling at a fair price.    The restaurant was humble but clean (the women's restroom was tidy). The service was excellent. It's clear that they take pride in their food.    I highly recommend this place.",

EVERY Thursday we order the same thing (shrimp burrito) and pay the $5.49 price . Well for some reason today , I get all the way through the line to pay and the lady says that shrimp is excluded and that it has ALWAYS been that way. Mind you there was NO sign specifying this. Another lady comes along and says \"we tell everyone that it's only for chicken, beef, and pork\". Well she nor anyone else told us that when we came in. We didn't have a problem with paying; HOWEVER, i informed her that we come every week and pay the same price, so this is a policy that is new. She then begin to argue me saying that it's always been this way and I never paid $5.49 for my shrimp burrito on a Thursday. We've noticed lately they have been taking things away and adding on extra charges without proper signage or notifying their customers. More specifically on Tuesday's and Thursday's . It's SHADY. Needless to say this was my last visit there , which is unfortunate because we have been loyal customers and think they have great food . Very disappointed in the customer service.",

The tacos were absolutely delicious they came on corn tortillas with your choices of beans and toppings!!! I also love this place because it is vegetarian friendly if you don't want meat you can get tofu which is a huge plus. You also get chips with access to the salsa bar. The chips provided to me were not so good they tasted over fried and oily the salsa bar was good though because it allows you the option to try a variety of salsas. I'm happy to say that I found a great place to grab Tacos on Tuesdays!!!!",

I was beginning to get worried about the burrito scene in Charlotte. if you like a giant (and i mean HUGE) California style burrito, this is exactly 100% without a smidgen of a doubt where you need to go get your fix.   The staff is always friendly to everyone that walks in the door, and fast at what they do as well. All of the veggies are fresh and colorful, and they offer some unique options that other burrito spots do not; like banana peppers and these delicious pickled red onions that add a nice little sweet bite to your meal.   The menu offers more than just your average burrito, too. My advice: try the curry chicken, pork, and wet California burritos- ypu won't be disappointed there. Also make sure you make it out for Taco Tuesday, where you can grab pork, chicken, or ground beef tacos for 99 cents a piece.   Oh yeah, don't miss out on the salsa bar. Everything is made in house, and the guajadillo and tomatillo salsas come highly recommended. I love this place, as it's become a go-to for me and my friends!!",

The environment is definitely a dive but most dives have THE BEST FOOD! Similar to Moes and Chipotle, this places offers a massive \"wet\" California style burrito. Food is fresh and prepared to order. Reasonable priced with ongoing daily specials.   Not only is the food good, the customer service is absolutely amazing. The staff is outgoing/friendly and willing to go above and beyond to make the customer feel welcome.",

Delicious!   Great Flavors all around.  Salsa bar?  Yes please.  Fyi the medium is an americans version of HOLY SHIOT my nose is running, \"may I please have some sour cream nice sweet chica behind the counter?\"     Decor is trendy and urban. But seriously, are we here for the decor or the food?   Give me a picnic table and paper towel dispenser on the table and I am happy.    If you have any doubts, I promise they will fade promptly as soon as the counter lady says hello.  If not, then shove that awesome burrito in your mouth, shut up and enjoy.  You can thank me later.",

    "text": "Not much to look at from the outside, but the parking lot decor isn't as important as what is inside. I'll echo some of the other Yelpers, this place rocks! I try to skip  carbs, so I avoided the rice and bean filled burritos. I ordered a salad, and had several choices of protein. I went with the steak, which was a great choice on my part. The toppings bar took a beating, I told the woman behind the counter to load me up with all the hot stuff, especially the diced fresh jalapenos. My wife ordered a shredded pork burrito, with no hot stuff. We are the odd couple.  After receiving our meals, I headed to the vaunted salsa bar. Other places might have more choices, but few have more creative choices. Regular & spicy pico de gallo, several mild to medium salsas, and a few with some heat. My favorite was the Guarillo, a medium heat orange colored smooth salsa.   How was our meal? Que delicioso! I chose the lime mint dressing for my salad, which blended well with the flames shooting from my bowl. The only complaint I had was that the lettuce could have been cut smaller or maybe shredded. Otherwise, my salad was far better than the other Mexican places we have tried. My wife's burrito was huge, she only finished half, she took the rest home with most of her tortilla chips. I rarely give 5 stars, tbf came pretty close. Maybe if one of the staff wasn't wearing a Jets cap, they would have gotten all 5. My wife is a Jets fan, I see enough of that crap at home. We will be back.",

    "text": "Here's all you need to know about Burrito Factory in two words: Taco Tuesdays. Fresh-made, delicious tacos with your choice of fillings for a buck apiece, and they aren't skimpy with the ingredients. Choose from chicken, spicy chicken, marinated pork or ground beef (if you're boring) protein, and a plethora of toppings.  Being my predictable self, I go for the heat with spicy chicken, diced jalapenos, hot pico de gallo, queso fresco, lettuce, salsa, fresh cilantro and cheese. Skip the .75 extra guacamole in favor of the addictively sweet heat of their creamy green tomatillo sauce, free on the self-serve bar. Seriously, it's so good I always take some home in the little clear containers. Oh yeah, free salsa and chips with every order. Since it's so good and prices are so cheap, please also bless the tip jar and go home happy and satisfied.",
