To make things even worse, the Goat Haleem sounds great on paper, what the menu description conveniently leaves out is that all ingredients are pureed together. It's like a tiny bowl of mushy meat and vegetables cereal! And way too expensive for the portion size.",

The green chutney that came with the food was really good as well and we had to bring some with us for the left overs. The owner came out to greet us and asked for feedback which was nice since they want to improve. I would definitely visit this place again.",

Also found staff to be friendly and responsive.  Nice that it's right next to the movie theater.   This is my new fav for kabobs in Charlotte.

For the mixed veggies they used totally different vegetables which included broccoli and cauliflower, not good because they cooked it too long and the veggies turned mushy and the dish was much smaller.

It's been difficult to find excellent dining experiences since moving to this side of town but Royal Biryani & Kabob is really good, and it's very affordably priced, too.  They have been open a month and it shows. It is almost a model in disorganization and confusion but the staff and owner are helpful friendly and accommodating as they get their sea legs in this endeavor.  The food is excellent enough to make up for any startup inconveniences!",

While the meat was well seasoned, it was very over cooked and required a dipping sauce (ordered extra) to get it down. The naan, when it eventually arrived half way through the meal, was tasty.   If it wasn't for the poor service, slow delivery, modest portions, bad cooking and over inflated prices, it could be a nice place. I hope I just had a rare bad experience. But from now on I'll just to back to Pita Kabab Grill.",

    "text": "This place is arguably THE most authentic Indian restaurant in town. We went to Royal Biryani and Kabob this past Saturday and here are our thoughts:  The Good: - The Food:  is arguably the best Indian food we have had in Charlotte. We have tried The Taj, Copper amongst other Indian restaurants but if you go by the sheer authenticity and quality of of the food, Royal Biryani and Kabob wins, hands down. To our knowledge, there isn't any other place that offers more authentic Indian cuisine in town.  The Bad: - Service : We dined in with 2 kids and 2 adults. They do not exactly have dedicated serving staff. They had 2 folks handling the takeout and dine-in business at the same time. Our food also took forever to arrive, it almost seemed like they were giving priority to their takeout orders.  - Space: Do not come here for the ambience, there is none. The space is spartan and the service, like mentioned above fairly non existent. The advice to the owner is that perhaps they should invest in dedicated wait staff.   I hope the owner can improve the dine-in experience, because the food is simply amazing.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here last night first impression was it is a takeout joint with places to sit and eat if you wish to. We decided to eat in the waiter came and took our order and offered us a pitcher of water. I ordered the butter chicken which was fabulous and very tasty and my husband ordered the chicken Haleem which he said was delicious. Only problem was we didn't get any rice and these are gravy dishes and are in dire need of rice so I asked the waiter for some and he looked at me a little odd and said OK but the rice never came so I asked a different person for rice and eventually rice did show up. I checked the menu and it appears that rice is separate for a charge of $4.99 which in my mind is ridiculous. A fellow I believe is the owner came over to us and said they made a change in that rice  is now not extra but you still have to order it. We also ordered the garlic naan which was very good and had an appetizer of the vegetable Samosa which was good if not a little dry and spicy. I ordered a cup of chai tea which took a while to get that was very good. All in all I would say the food here is excellent but they are disorganized which I am sure they will work out with time as they said they had only been open for 30 days. On a sidenote I just ate my leftovers for lunch and they were just as good as it was last night. We highly recommend this restaurant for very good authentic Indian food.",

I received my food, then our appetizer came 5 minutes later, followed shortly by my wife's haleem and probably 10 minutes later my son's biriyani came out.    No glasses, water is bottled and $1.20, which costs more than their canned soda offering. A pitcher of tap water would be fine, but wasn't offered. Something to keep in mind if you order something spicy... Mango lassy came in small styrofoam cup.   Would probably order again for takeout, but the meals seemed lacking. Order a kebab and that's all you get, $10 for a couple chunks of meat. $14 haleem, same deal. No bread, no rice, no veg, everything is ordered separately. Kinda hard to make a meal without spending $20/pp ordering multiple things and $50-60 is a lot to spend on takeout.",

Got a comment from the owner today after an year of my post which clearly shows that either he is misinformed or is clearly disillusioned..there is seriously something wrong..however my review is based on the quality of biriyani we had an year ago..not sure if that improved..",

    "text": "Oddest experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Greeted by, food order taken and bill given by 2 kids, both probably under the age of 13.  Presented themselves well but still really weird.  Seems to be family run but the food is not authentic.  Paneer kathi roll tasted like a sad imitation of a Big Mac with raw paneer and raw onions, with 1 lonely green pepper and tomato piece added in.  Vegetable Biryani was still wet and much spicier than requested.  Update following the business' comment: I still stand by my review.  Apologies that I miscalculated the girls age; but the boy who greeted us and took our order was still young.  I've never heard of a Kathi roll being a \"cold sub\".  If you are trying your hand at fusion food then you might want to consider actually describing it.  I hadn't realized that a spice level 5 out of 10 was considered spicy, I thought that meant medium.  Good to note!!!    As for letting my server know - if I thought I would have liked the taste after the changes then I would have bothered with the effort.  Previously I hadn't bothered mentioning that the raita that was served was so sour that I actually believe it had gone rancid.    We came here on the recommendation of a friend.  They liked the food (take out), we did not.  My feelings and feedback on the restaurant have nothing to do with my outlook on life. I wish you the best and much success.",

All the dishes I have tried have been delicious, full of rich flavors, and made with clearly high-quality ingredients. The menu isn't huge, but there is certainly plenty of variety to suit different preferences. The dining room is small, but I myself have gotten take-away here, and noticed that many people seem to do so, leaving ample room for dine-in customers. I love Indian food, and have dined at many Indian restaurants, and I can honestly say that Royal Boryani is among the best I have tried. My elderly parents also have loved it both times they have had it. It's definitely a favorite with our family!",

They have the ajwain seeds on the wrapper that make it taste like it's out of a sweet stall in India. Amazing! The bread is without a doubt best bread in Charlotte. Garlic naan and aloo paratha with that butter. Tasted like some bread I ate in Chandigarh a year ago. Kadai paneer made the right way as well. And to top it all the service was impeccable. They even gave me an extra mango lassi to go. The mango lassi was amazing as well. Can't wait for my next trip for more.",

We shared the outstanding lamb biryani and bhindaloo goat (a few bones but lots of flavor) but the real surprise was the kashmiri naan.  Soft and warm naan with coconut and honey in the middle.  This is Northern Indian at its best, and you can get it spicy to taste on a scale from 1 -10.  The staff was kind and helpful, led by a delightful young host/waiter/son of the owner, who was most enthusiastic.  They've only been open for 4 months but we are definitely going back.  Their secret is that they do not skimp on spices (curry, saffron, etc.) - not just heat, but the flavorful spices that make the difference between standard buffet fare and truly good Indian food.  One of the best Indian restaurants we have found!",

I was told for a tandoori chicken order it came with four legs and two breast. I got two drumsticks and two breast it's literally 2 tablespoons of rice. I then checked the seekh kebab and it look like someone did not know how to make it. It's not actual kebab. It looks like falafel. I don't even know what to call it. I will post pictures. I was charged $50 for those two dishes and a chicken tikka masala. They definitely over charge here for mediocre food. The tandoori chicken and the seekh kabob were both dry. The chicken tikka Masala was 7/10 but hardly any chicken in there. The only positive about this place is when you ask for mild in spice, they provide it.",

I've been about five times in the past month in a half. Each time I've tried something different and everything has been delicious. Their lunch specials are fantastic. Dinner menu is of course a little more expensive but you get a bigger selection. So far the Kadai curry and biryani are my favorites. If you like Indian food, go here! You'll be so glad you did.",

Had a traditional curry with chicken (if ya can't do a traditional curry right then what's the point being open) and it was spot on.   Located corner of Sardis North & Monroe (in the shops by the movie theater). Just thought I'd share. Would like to see this place stick around. The owner is a gem.   Just my two cents.",

We spent about 2.5 hrs. in the restaurant and we've got two kids under the age of three, so, that sort of time frame doesn't work well for us. The food is incredibly fresh, authentic, and clearly made from scratch. I would be thrilled to eat Royal's food again (and again), however, I'm putting them in the take-out category from now on. Order your food about an hour before you intend to pick it up.   Of note, the interior is very clean and staff are friendly and clearly care about the quality of the food. It has the feel of a family-run restaurant, in a good way.",

I had the Chicken Tika Masala with soup, naan, and a special dessert. The naan was perfectly soft and luxurious, the soup was herby and full of flavor, and the chicken was tender and juicy. I am so happy we have a new place to go and fill ourselves with this wonderfully heart-warming food. There's no doubt that this food has been prepared with love and care. I plan to go every week for lunch which was reasonably priced for such amazing food.    Update: April 3, 2019 - The food here is amazing, as always. The community needs to come out and support this amazing chef's dream so I can keep eating it!  This has been a weekly haunt for me since I found it 7 months ago and it is just as good as day one.

Like the restaurant before, the menu doesn't say if rice comes with the curry.  I wanted to be sure to ask for rice.  It did come with the meal because the total didn't change.  I ordered the vegetable Shahi korma that has a nice amount of veggies.  Usually I'd order chicken and ask for some veggies to come with it.  The spice level ranged from 1-10.  I picked 5 for a halfway point which was sensible.  I could do a 6 next time.  The garlic naan met my expectations.  The food was much more appealing to the eye.  I will return for more.  I'll probably get the Kadai, carrot halwa, or the supreme rasmalai next time.",

A Chili Garlic Naan, a Butter Roti, and a Butter Naan. We were getting full so we only had the Black Buttery Dahl. Which was a lite brown but needed more seasoning. The Chili Garlic Naan was so delicious ! The wait in between courses was way too long. Cannot figure out why, it wasn't busy and the Dahl would have already been cooked. Friendly waitress. Just needs some fine tuning .",

You can also tell them, on a scale of 1-10 how hot/spicy you would like your dish. Samosa Chat is an excellent appetizer.  The vegetable biryani comes with two great sauces and is huge; enough for 2 meals or leftovers. The garlic naan is crispy and delish. If you like Indian food, this can be your go-to place, especially since the prices are reasonable.",

The lunch special comes with soup or salad, naan bread, rice, and the dessert of the day. They ask you about spice level when you order and also after you've had a chance to try your food which I've never encountered before but really appreciated. I would definitely suggest giving this place a try.",

    "text": "After ordering takeout a few times, I finally tried Royal Biryani in person. There were some hits and misses but overall I enjoyed the experience.   This is not a fancy place, but the homey family atmosphere created by the manager (? owner?) and her playful children running around made our night happy. Our 3 yr old started playing with her 3 yr old. The people at the table behind me turned around and started talking to us. The table on the other side of us joined in and before long the entire restaurant was having dinner and conversation together.   The service was good and the food was hot and fresh. I ordered two plates of the JADUEE GOBI because the first plate was so good. I asked for the first extra crispy and it was. And it was delicious. The second wasn't quite as good since I didn't specify that but still nice flavor. Good onion cilantro tomato sauce mixture. A little spice (I chose level 5 of 10), a little tart, a little sweet. Pretty well rounded.   The FISH CURRY was very fishy tasing, which is common to every Indian restaurant I've ever eaten fish curry at. Overall the flavor was good and the rice was right    The ONION KULCHA was clearly homemade, which is nice. However everything about it was a fail for me. The onions inside were still very firm and raw. The dough was uncooked and thick. And the only edible pieces were around the edges. This could've benefited from a bit more time in the tandoor.   I will come back for the Gobi though.",

    "text": "Not my favorite Indian Cuisine. I live right around the corner from this new spot, so I thought I'd give it a try. The samosa's are huge so they give you 2 verses the smaller ones, I prefer. I did manage to eat most of them because those were decent, but really oily. I didn't care for anything else. I've labeled my pictures so feel free to read away.   The Paneer Kathi roll was huge, but it was cold like an egg salad wrap. It was also a little sweet so I didn't enjoy that at all.   The Tikhe Paneer taste similar to chili chicken without the meat and spices. It was a little spicy, but it taste like hot sauce and oil. No herbs at all. I didn't like this dish either.   The Vegetable Biryani was okay.   Samosa's were decent just very oily and thick. I prefer the appetizer size.   Garlic naan was good, but anybody can make that happen, lol.   Overall, I would not give this place another go. I don't eat meat, so I couldn't try the popular tikka masala. Maybe their curry dishes are better, who knows?  All I know is this place doesn't  compare to Jaipur Indian Cuisine on South Blvd. or Hyderabadi Biryani House off Lancaster Hwy.",

    "text": "Update ---  They've added some serving staff so ... 5 stars!  ---  The food is really good and so are the We've been multiple times and tried several dishes - chicken tikka masala, chicken/veg bhindaloo, Shahi korma, shahi minced paneer, malai kofta, Garlic naan and aaloo dhaniya paratha. All were really good, but I guess my least favorite was the bhindaloo. It could have used a little more flavor and heat. I would still try it again at a higher spice #. Shahi korma was my favorite (even though I nearly burnt myself up with an 8).If you're afraid of heat, no worries. My husband likes dishes on the milder side and his dishes (3s & 4s) come out to his liking.   The only cons on this place are the location (strip mall-ish) and the service. Location is what it is and we don't mind. Service is my reason for 4 stars and not 5. There's sometimes just one person taking orders, serving, preparing deliveries, answering the phone, and working the register. That can result in some slow downs. They are in the process of hiring more servers, kitchen staff, etc. so I think the service will absolutely pick up.   Overall, the food is fantastic + service issues will be corrected soon with additional staff. Will add a star when that happens. I am looking forward to eating at this place regularly.",

We both loved them! They were huge, full of flavor, and succeeded at satisfying my craving. My mom also enjoyed them. They came with 2 different sauces, one green, one like a dark brown. The green sauce brought out the flavors in the food more. The brown sauce was sweet but also enjoyable. I would definitely recommend.",

We ordered the Aloo Gobi, Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Biryani, plus two orders of Garlic Naan. The staff was on their A game tonight. Even the chef came out and did table checks. We ordered everything with a spice level of five and we liked the fact that the Tandoori came with sliced chili's so we could go up a notch or two if we wanted. Next time we will try the spice level of 7 and see where that leads. Alicia liked that the Tandoori Chicken was juicy. I liked that the chicken in the Biryani was tender. Karl liked everything. It's a great little restaurant for a date night.",
