    "text": "I left Bang Bang Burgers somewhat unsatisfied. Usually, any burger joint that offers a variety of different styles of burgers makes me content but this place just didn't fulfill my expectations. The dining experience was the same as one would have going to a five-guys or a burger-fi. Their choices of burgers incorporates a lot of Asian fusion so I give them a thumbs up for trying. I had the \"Gangnam Style\" burger and thankfully chose their double patty option (additional couple of dollars). Even with double patties, I felt like I was paying way too much for the amount of meat I was getting. Yes I know it's organic-grass fed beef and I believe it ---but for the price, I don't know if it was quite worth it. Even though the burger had some greens (too little, in my opinion), the pork-belly and the beef patty combined made the burger overly greasy. Three out of the four in my party got the \"Gangnam Style\" burger and we all agreed that the burger wasn't all that great. My girlfriend even had somewhat of an upset stomach after her dining experience at Bang Bang. Peculiarly, the highlight of my visit here were the onion rings which were crunchy and delicious but not over-battered, so I can recommend those. Still, at any burger restaurant, the consumer shouldn't be raving about the onion rings over the burgers.  Overall, a \"meh\" experience. I am open to the idea of coming back and trying different burgers but for now, it'll be at the bottom of my list in places to visit when I go back to Charlotte.",

That's because its' hidden away in a tiny plaza on the corner of 7th and Pecan, between a subshop and a Caribbean restaurant, and I have lately been kicking myself because I've been driving past this tiny little burger joint for the longest time when I should have been eating there. Bang Bang Burgers has been pumping out some of the best burgers in the Charlotte area for a little over a year now - creating a menu of both solid favorites like bacon burgers and other more exotic concoctions, all featuring the freshest ingredients with little gourmet touches to make your tastebuds explode with flavor. If you like a regular old burger go to Five Guys. If you want something with just as much meat but with a ton more flavorful options with a reasonable price, go to Bang Bang. Two Bangs, because the Bang is not only in the buck (price) but also the flavor, as your tastebuds will savor, and thank you later, gator.",

The mix of toppings in addition to the original flavor is impeccable at this burger place. I'm not even tempted to look further for the best burger in Charlotte.",

And there it was, my delicious shake shack type burger made with Pat Lafrida beef!!!   Today when a co-worker and I were talking about where to grab lunch I quickly thought of this place and off we went.   We were greeted by a super enthusiastic employee who explained all the menu (wish I could remember his name!), the beef and the general awesomeness that is this place!   I ordered the hangover burger and it truly was burger perfection. We had a little issue with the ketchup bottle exploding all over the table and the same employee as above quickly helped clean it up and then the owner came over to make sure we were ok and we started talking.   He was so passionate about his business that even if the food wasn't to die for I would go back just to support him! But that won't be an issue sine I'll be back again and again since the food is bangin'! (Sorry- I couldn't resist).",

Walking in, the decor is cozy and inviting. Ordering at the counter, the staff was friendly and helpful suggesting a few of the most popular burgers. I ordered the Pimento Burger, I'm a sucker for anything having to do with Pimento, well cheese in general, but you catch my drift. Colin ordered in the safer side, deciding on the original 'bang, bang' Our friends orders the 'hangover' and 'Cowboy'. The burgers aren't cheap as far as burgers go. You're looking at 10ish bucks- so not bad especially for the quality of burger.   Sweet potato fries, fresh local burger buns and maple ranch dipping sauce. YUM! This place was surprisingly good. I'll for sure be returning.",

    "text": "I ordered an apple compote burger and a 22oz OMB.  Service: For being an order-at-the-counter style, service was quick. The server was friendly in advice off the menu, being my frist time there.  Wait time: Food didn't take too long to come out, though I was in on a Sunday and it was not busy (two other tables). I want to say I waited about ten minutes for food.  Burger: The burger toppings were delicious. A delightful combination. The patties themselves, I felt, could have been better. They seemed like the same variety you find at a Burger King. Though not terrible, for the price I felt like the meat should have been fresher. There were also only two temperatures, medium or medium well, that could be obtained. This wasn't a deal breaker, but I almost always get a medium rare. Again, the patties were too small to be able to do this. I would have liked to see a freshly packed patty.   Side: Sweet potato fries were just so-so. About a fourth were burnt and tasteless, the rest were fresh and delicious. I won't make assumptions as to why, just was the way it was.   All in all, it wasn't perfect but it was still quite good. I will probably stick to Cowfish or Bad Daddy's for my burger retreat, but if I'm ever need of a good burger on that side of town, I'd stop in again.",

They use mondo sized portobella mushrooms which is lightly battered tempura style and top it off with large onion rings. A little on the greasy side but full of flavor with their signature bang bang sauce. For a veggie option it's the same cost as a meat option which I don't see how that is fair. I usually order it with sweet potato fries with a sweet maple white sauce but the sweet potato fries are always over cooked and rubbery.   If you've ever been to a Zoe's Kichen or Panera that is how this restaurant is set up. But the atmosphere reminds you of a Chipotle. You go in, fall in line and order and they give you a number as you wait at a table of your choosing. Service is very friendly and helpful with their menu.",

The burger was DELICIOUS... even though It had onion strings, jalapenos and ghost pepper cheese on it, you could really taste the juicy meat (Pat LaFreida's beef... the best!). Everything was cooked perfectly (bun, patties, onion rings).... rings were tasty! My wife got the mushroom Swiss burger, which had nice thick and long strips of portobello over the swiss... which she ever much enjoyed. My son got the kids burger with bacon and cheese and ate the entire burger (not small). If you plan on eating there, it's a but tight (not a large seating area), and there were plenty folks getting take out. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend this joint.",

    "text": "Honestly...not anywhere near to what I expected. Another disappointment of a North Carolina establishment of food. Not excited about this, but one thing. The ranch.   Alright, we literally planned this for weeks and a group of 10 of us showed up. Ok it's a smaller place and seating for the time we went wasn't an issue, but it definitely could have been, so I am thankful for that.   I ordered the weekly special which was the chimichurri burger and it sounded good. I got this over the TNT burger based on the servers recommendation. We spent over $150 before we go any further.  So I ordered EXTRA crispy fries. They came SOGGY. I asked for MEDIUM cooked, it was WELL. These are two critical errors in a burger joint. They ask me specifically of how I want my burger cooked and then it comes out wrong, then that's on them not me. When I asked for extra crispy fries then they are not even stiff they were soggy and lumpy. UGH. The flavor was fine on the special actually so a star for that.  My friend next to me got the pimento cheese burger and added burger. It was good and add a star to this review.  Here is why I didn't say anything. I didn't eat anything all day. I hate sending food back as a matter of purpose and waste. Purpose it should be done right the first time. Ok we are not perfect fine. And then I didn't want to literally waste a whole meal in the trash. And no one came to check on us to see how our food was so I couldn't even say anything anyways.   The ranch was good. Another star for that. Honestly I will give them another try. I'm just annoyed my burger was over cooked and my fries were soggy and halfway cold. Well till next time.",

    "text": "Wowie Wow Wow Wow! This was my second trip to Bang Bang, and i had my burger cravings satisfied to the max. I ate here the first time, perhaps 2 years ago. I always knew I would return, but kept putting it off.   This trip I decided to try something else other than the onion, bacon and cheese deal. So I went with the TNT burger with all the spicy accouterments like ghost pepper cheese, jalapenos, and Sriracha mayo (on the side). It was hot, but not uncomfortably so. I dumped a little too much mayo halfway through, which had me reaching for my drink more often- but the taste was still delicious. It's certainly not make your nose run hot, if you are a person who likes some heat, you'll be able to handle it.  My little one pegged this place as her favorite burger spot in town the first time we went. I liked it, but I wasn't so ready to give it that designation. But now? Oh yeah- it's up there. Who knew a youngster would have better sense to choose before I would! Lol!",

Excellent quality beef from NYState, chargrilled to perfection and buns made in Charlotte. Came with lettuce, tomato, red onion, awesome homemade pickles and bang bang sauce.  When the onion rings came out, I thought they were not crisp enough, wrong! They were great, crunchy fried outside and just right on the inside. The wife had the small bang bang burger and fries and we both had a soft drink. The price for all was $30. Steep for us , but we're willing to pay a premium for great food (on occasion).  The staff were friendly and patient with us while we decided what we wanted, (as this was our first visit). They must be limited on space, they have storage shelves and lockers in the hallway to the bathroom and in the bathroom. The shelves were all covered with black cloth. This made it look better. The bathrooms were clean and in good order. I will visit again when I'm in the area.",

    "text": "So, who has Charlotte's best burger? Yeah, I'm not throwing my hat into that debate and proclaiming a winner. I will say Bang Bang Burgers is definitely in the conversation.   This place is kind of tucked away in a little strip mall on 7th Street. The menu isn't huge, but it's still a burger lover's dream. For you non-burger folks, there are a few options for you. Key word: few (chicken sandwich, salmon blt, quinoa black bean veggie burger, and salad). I usually get a mushroom swiss burger or the bang bang burger (bangburger sauce is a must). I'm a big fan of the onion rings here. Parents, kids eat free on Tuesdays.   I love the presentation. The burgers come out on little wood cutting boards. Local beer options. The workers are really friendly. This parking lot can get kind of crazy during the day. If you're trying to go left on 7th Street coming out of here, make sure you exit on the Pecan Street side and hit that red light. It'll save you the headache of trying to pull out into the 7th Street traffic.",

I thought that was a very good idea. Although, I should have known if I would have paid more attention to the pics that many of you all have posted lol.  My burger was fantastic! It was one of the best burgers I've had that wasn't cooked by my wife or mother-in-law (seriously they make the best burgers!). I liked how they set it up where you add the toppings and sauces to your specifications.  I also ordered the onion rings instead of the fries. The onion rings were top notch. If they weren't the best I've had, then they were definitely in the top 3.   All in all, I enjoyed my visit and intend to come back soon.",

I personally thought it was a great combo even with the cashier's warning that wasn't a very popular duo. The egg was cooked nicely as over easy, even though I saw some pics on Yelp with an overcooked and unappetizing egg. So the burger was great and filling. I upgraded to the onion rings and I shouldn't have. The wife got the regular burger and fries, and I ended up eating more of her fries than the rings. There was too much batter and it ended up ruining the onion.  However, I did ask what type of oil they use to fry their items due to a nut/soy allergy, and they indicated using a blend of canola and rice bran oil. After a quick google search on rice bran oil, I found out it's good quality oil with some health benefits. So if I'm going to eat fried food, might as well eat some healthier cooking oil. The interior and atmosphere is nothing special as it's more of a fast casual spot. Glad I tried it and would recommend it, but only warrants an occasional return for me.",

The icing which is served with the sweet potato fries was very... cheesy, I guess would be how to explain it, It wasn't good but that is just my opinion. My burger was good but like I said, it's the same burger as anywhere else, nothing special. The sweet potato fries got all of my attention, they were good but nothing special. The restuarant itself was okay, clean, the staff were polite, and helpful when I wanted to dip my fries in ranch instead of cheesy cream cheese icing. I'm guessing the grease upset my tummy so, I probably won't be returning. Still worth a visit if you're a fan of Guy Fieri!

And my taste buds sure were happy that we did.  Walking into Bang Bang Burgers, I had no idea what I was going to order. But as soon as I saw the specials sign with the Mac and Cheese Burger, I knew I had to get it. This burger was topped with housemade mac and cheese and bacon that was drizzled with honey and sriracha. It sounded like such a good balance of flavors that I just couldn't resist. I ordered it with two patties and with a side of the sweet potato fries. The burger was really juicy and I loved the flavor of the burger and the sweet potato fries were super fresh.  The staff here also delivered great service. Since we had never been there before, the cashier let us know what some of the more popular burgers were and next time I am going to go with their award winning Pimento Burger for sure. Not to mention, the staff here also brought out our food super fast.   We got to the shopping center a little after 1:30PM on a Saturday and were happy to see that there were some available spots to park. But I wouldn't be surprised if the parking here gets tough. There were even flyers on the tables in the restaurant warning you from parking there and walking across the street, because you might get towed or get a ticket.",

My wife sat down with our kids while I was ordering and one of the employees almost kicked her out of the table. Will not return.",

Cost $12.50 (fries and drink not included)  The place was packed, but only had to wait 10 minutes to get a table.. an additional 20 before we got our food.  First impression: small small patties... almost as small as a $1 burger patty from a fast food establishment.  Taste: Great! Not the best I've had, but very good!  After I finished my burger.. my friend looks at me.. \"you still hungry too huh?\"   Conclusion: Great tasting burger, but it was too expensive for what it was! The small patties left us still hungry! I don't see myself coming back to eat here again.",

I ordered the Pimento Burger, he ordered the Bang Bang Burger. We both ordered their advertised \"fresh cut fries\". I'm a huge french fry junkie and never pass up an opportunity for fresh-cut.   The service was friendly and the we waited less than 10 minutes to get our order. The burgers were very good. The buns were awesome. The 3 star rating is from the awful fries. They may be fresh cut but they just weren't the type of fresh cut that appealed to me. Apparently they use some type of batter that makes a thick coating on the fry making them too crunchy for my liking. There was no potatoey taste.I could only eat a few. Now, many people may like that \"style\" of fry but imo, Arby's has better fries than this place. When I think of fresh cut fries, I think of Five Guys, Thomas St Tavern and a handful of others that I like.  I plan to revisit BBB but next time I will get the Onion Rings. They looked better.",

Local beer on tap and a choice selection of sides like fried homemade pickles, hand cut fries, and house made onion rings round out the menu.

The menu includes two draft craft beers and three or four canned local beers. You can get the drafts in 12 or 24 ounce mugs. I think the girl behind the counter said something about a beer special on Tuesday or Wednesday. She was very friendly and answered all my questions.   I decided on a double burger of the cowboy style (onions, cheddar, bacon, and BBQ sauce) although I added an egg. For a side I substituted the standard fries for sweet potato fries for a dollar up charge. The burger was quite messy and I don't think I was a fan of the thin burgers though, it made for a slippery mess. The fries were decent, but there were a bunch of those little tiny scrappy pieces. They seemed more greasy than I prefer, but maybe that was from the burger.  I would return, but I'm not going to dream about in the mean time.",

    "text": "For today's review we headed south of Charlotte to the Elizabeth neighborhood. This neighborhood was named after Elizabeth College, a small Lutheran women's college founded in 1897 and is now the site of Presbyterian Hospital. Bang Bang Burgers is tucked into the back corner of the Twin Oaks Shopping Center, our second visit here. Dora here. So many cool looking restaurants in this area to tempt us along the way!   Service was speedy. The Fried Pickles appetizer appeared within minutes. The fried pickles were worth the return visit, a combination between a dill and sweet pickle served with a homemade ranch dipping sauce, cut into spears with heavy batter. They had to be one of the best fried pickles that I have ever tried. Dora here, The Best. Fried. Pickle. Ever. Sweet and sour warred on my tongue. Why don't more places fry sweet pickles?   My Bang Bang Burger was served with American cheese, lettuce, tomato and their famous Bangburger Sauce while the onion rings were also served with the Bangburger sauce for dipping. The burger was moist, ample size, and charred well. The onion rings were good but I preferred the Maple dipping sauce that came with my wife's sweet potatoes fries.  Dora's Cowboy Burger was served with sharp cheddar, bacon, and a smoky BBQ sauce while the sweet potatoes fries came with the lick-your-fingers-delicious maple dipping sauce. Dora here. Burgers are my go-to, and this burger was OK, not great. It was missing drip-down-your-chin juiciness. Presentation was beautiful, and the fries were sweet and moist. They would have been great on their own, but the maple dipping sauce rocketed them to awesome.   I would rate this establishment 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to try Bang Bang Burgers for some time since they opened, and since I finally tried them, I've already been back in less than a week.  Yes, their burgers are THAT good.  My husband and I have had their guacamole, cowboy, Seoul, and one special burger (an outstanding fried green tomato/avocado/arugula burger).  My brother and his wife joined us the second time, both of them getting the hangover burger.  Their burgers are juicy and delicious, even if they only cook them to medium or well doneness.  I didn't realize the guacamole burger didn't come with cheese, so next time I'll add pepper jack for an extra kick.  And thinking of their fries and onion rings is enough to make me salivate. Their rings are coated with a tempura batter and fried till crispy.  Their fries are thin and very crispy as well.  While ketchup is a mainstay, I prefer to dip my fries and rings in their homemade chipotle ranch.  Yum!  They showcase beers from local breweries (Old Meck) and serve them in frosted glasses.  And service at this little place is super friendly.  We'll definitely be visiting Bang Bang Burgers more regularly now!",

I had the bacon cheese burger and my wife tried the the salmon burger bowl. Let's start off by saying the bacon tasted old! As if it were sitting there since they opened up this morning \" hoping it's not an old batch from last night \" which is why I gave this place 3 stars. The burger meat and cheese tasted fresh and was good! I personally love fries and these fries were awesome! They reminded me of 5 guys burger fries. Now for the salmon , it did taste fresh but in my opinion lacked some flavor not much cause the salad dressing gave it some kick. A bit too oily for my blood but passable. $10 for a bacon cheese burger , $14 for the salmon burger bowl. Most likely will not be passing by again. I can go to 5 guys burger and get a bigger burger for the same price!",

But what really did it for me was the $7 chicken \"tenders\" and fries basket that we got for my son - the \"tenders\" were shaped nuggets (think McDonald's). After mentioning it to staff, they admitted that the menu may be misleading, but that was it. While both my husband and I weren't unhappy with our food, there wasn't anything that impressed us either. We usually go here every couple of months, but we won't be back.",

Speaking of the fries, they were perfectly crisp and cooked perfectly. They were a great complement to an awesome burger.

    "text": "Burger places are a dime a dozen, and a couple times a year a new one pops up somewhere in the Charlotte area. Most are decent enough, but very few stand out from the crowd that pleasantly surprise me. And now every trendy micro-chain tries to stand out with a wider variety of ingredients, sauces, or meats, all of them trying to offer a wider array of options for every appetite. Options aplenty, but the flavors themselves are sometimes blandly the same from one place to the next, which just isn't acceptable when you could have the same result on your grill at home.   Yet every now and then, I get a seriously good burger that makes me want to sing its praises. Bang Bang has some seriously banging burgers. The patties are flavorful, juicy, and large. I tried the aptly named Hangover burger, about $10 with a large side of fries. The toasted buns held the mountain of fresh toppings. You can taste when something was cooked hours ago and just reheated, or freshly made to order. Bang Bang does it the latter way and your tastebuds reap the rewards.",

Booths, tables and TV's on the walls. They brought us home made potato chips and sauce which was very tasty. This is a burger place. If you love burgers like I do, you will be very satisfied. Food was perfect and delivered as ordered in about 5 minutes. So glad I got a chance to check it out.

The Seoul burger was wrapped in two huge lettuce leafs that made eating it maybe half as messy as it could have been. The burger was great with the kimchi really popping against the ground beef. The broccoli was broccoli, but just having a lighter option as a side is nice.  I left feeling lighter than when I came in.",

The toppings were the largest downfall - the bacon was pencil thin and pretty over cooked, the lettuce and tomato were not what should come on a $12 burger.

I think they're fishing with dynamite due to their location, so it's unlikely they will improve - but some small improvements would go a long way value wise.",

Maybe 7 or 8 highly battered and grease-soaked onion rings- probably not cooked in hot enough oil.    Conflicting thoughts. Pro: tasty burgers. Good fries. Major non-food con: men's room was old and not particularly clean- water on floor, paper towels on floor, room itself overdue and in need of renovation. Men's room also used for restaurant storage- curtained off shelves (space tight in restaurant I believe). Not sure if the conditions I saw carry over to the condition and cleanliness of the kitchen area. Excellent food wins though.",

I ordered a TNT burger and a friend ordered the Mushroom and Swiss. With multiple TVs the atmosphere was family-friendly and noise levels were at a medium. The burgers took less than 10 minutes and I was pretty impressed with the presentation. They have the top bun on the side of the burger allowing you to view all the toppings. Overall, the TNT burger had a kick to it due to the jalapenos, but the fried onion string was more on the side of fried batter than fried onion. The Mushroom and Swiss burger was very neutral flavor so I gave my friend some jalapenos to add a fresh taste. Not the greatest burger I have tried but definitely worth trying out!",

You want a sunny side egg on top with onion straws and ham? Yep, they got that too. I'm more of a burger \"naturalist\" meaning that I appreciate something that's simple and a burger that's much more than just throwing 5 weird toppings on it; hold all of the extra shit, it's unnecessary.   The fries are good, but nothing groundbreaking and it's nice that they have a few draft beers to choose from. This is a counter-order style restaurant, so it's fast and casual. In addition to being casual, it's extremely crowded on the inside with tables stacked on top of each other. It's also not the cheapest with each burger costing around $10 and doesn't include fries or a drink. Plan on dropping $15/person.     While it's a good burger spot, it fails to really stand out among other establishments such as American Burger Co. and Cowbell. A solid 3/5...You won't be disappointed, but you also won't be blown away.",

While sitting in the car waiting for my family to arrive, I pulled up their website to see exactly what we were getting ourselves into. Keeping reading to learn the secrets about this Gem.  Have you ever heard of the saying \"The proof is in the pudding\"? Well when it comes to Bang Bang Burger, the proof is definitely in the name. I was able to experience this Gem for the first time with my family and let me tell you we weren't disappointed one bit.  Dukes Bread, owned by Adam and Ellen Duke, is a local bakery here in Charlotte. What makes them so special in the Bang Bang burger experience is that the brioche buns are shaped by hand from scratch with real butter and King Arthur flour, making them fresh. Let's just get one thing clear this is not just any ole flour, we're talking the first class section in the flour bizz.  What stood out most to me was, as I'm ordering my food I caught a glimpse of the menu and it read \"Voted Best Burger 2015, 2016, and 2017\". I instantly fell in love! They definitely have my vote for 2018.  I selected the Cowboy (cooked medium well) which has sharp cheddar, bacon, and Bang Bang's homemade BBQ sauce.  Since 1922 the LaFrieda family (experts in making Bang Bang's juicy burger patties), a third generation meat vendor in North Bergen, New Jersey has been offering different cuts of every source of protein you can think of.   Earlier I said that the proof is the name. Why is that? My dad paid for three adults meals (a burger, hand cut fries, and a drink) and one kid's meal, he spent a little over forty bucks. Now tell me that's not a steal.",

I quickly wrote down the name and saved it in my notes.   2 months later I finally came to see what all the fuss was about & omg the fuss is real I got the Swiss mushroom burger with spicy mayo & home fries. I absolutely enjoyed the burger. It was so juicy!! Also the cheese platter boards are so cute, it adds the perfect touch.  Service was quick - no long lines. Sunday around 8pm is the perfect time to go. I def plan on going back to try their other burgers",

Their beer selection is also spot on and they have a couple taps featuring local brews.   I enjoyed the black bean quinoa burger and LOVED the green bean salad. Ted had the cowboy burger with fries. I snuck a few french fries and had serious side envy. The fries were perfectly seasoned, crunchy and hot. Yum!

    "text": "Let's see, you show up to Bang Bang and don't order onion rings? YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, SIR/MA'AM.  Yes, the burgers are the showstoppers but the onion rings are bonafide scene stealers. They are lightly-battered rings that are fried in such a way, your taste buds will rejoice. Yes, I'm being awfully dramatic in describing onion rings but they are just that good.  Now, back to the burger. I went the classic route and ordered the bang bang burger because when in Rome, am I right? It also comes with bang bang sauce which you need to fully slather on top of your burger as well as use to liberally dip aforementioned onion rings in. I'm not usually a pickles on my burger girl but bang bang makes their own pickles and that changes everything. The pickles were/are lightly tangy and crisp. I would've been very happy with a heavy-handed portion of the pickles on my burger.  I asked for my burger to be cooked 'medium' and it was juicy and perfectly cooked. Needless to say, I inhaled the burger. After finishing off the burger, I was satisfied and didn't feel like a gross overeating beast (like normal).  They offer burgers of the week as well as weekday specials such as 'half off craft beers' on Wednesdays and 'kids eat free' Tuesdays. The interior is short on space and can get pretty hot inside on a warm day. There are a couple of tables right outside for outdoor dining.  Thankfully, the menu isn't that extensive so I'm pretty confident in being able to try every single one. I cannot wait to go back, I'm already planning on taking a bite out of the cowboy burger!",

Not many burger joints keep me coming back but Bang Bang's creations are unique and exciting to the type of person who is sick of the average five guys standard.  I recommend the hangover burger which is amazing complete with potato bacon hash.   In addition the cowboy burger is incredibly delicious as well with a truly unique BBQ sauce that come on the side.  I also enjoyed some of the old burgers they had which featured porkbelly but I'm sure they are constantly changing up the menu.  I've also heard they have many off menu items and I'm sure they can pretty much make a burger anyway you like. Lastly, the fries here and other sides are all great which only add to the experience.  BONUS:  they have Mexican Coke by the liter in a glass bottle for any of you Coca Cola aficionados out there.  Enjoy- I know I'll be back many more times!",

I didn't know this place would be set up like a Smashburger so I was a little surprised when I walked in.  I was picturing a Bad Daddy's or Cowbell for some reason.  Nonetheless, the decor was cafe style, they had a couple large screen TV's showing some type of sporting event, fountain sodas, etc.    The menu was easy to read behind the counter and there were roughly 10 types of burgers to choose from.  My husband went with the basic \"bang bang burger\" and I opted for the \"guacamole burger.\"  I was given the head's up from my fellow yelper that they would allow you to do a lettuce wrap so that was my \"bun\" of choice.  I also upgraded (for $1) to the sweet potato fries.  The food came out pretty quickly so that was a good thing and there were plenty of fries on the side that made me happy!  My husband's first impression was that the sandwich was all bun, very little meat.  My burger wrapped in lettuce was almost like a strip of a burger instead as opposed to a big hearty piece of meat.  Do you know those dollar chicken wraps you can get at McDonald's?  This was very reminiscent of one of those...The burgers were lean alright...almost too lean!  However, they were good.  Of course I love the fact that they come from a farm that does not use hormones or other additives in their meat.  I think the quality was far better than any normal \"fast food\" place but I wasn't expecting to compare it to a Wendy's or McDonald's so that is really not the point...  The burgers were juicy and definitely had good flavor but I would get the double if you are even slightly hungry.  I think the double would still only equate to a quarter pounder so you can definitely handle it.  It appears that all the burgers are served with their coveted \"bang bang\" sauce, which I am pretty sure is 1000 island. It was still good.  The fries were hand cut which I thought were awesome.  Unfortunately, the sweet potato fries were pretty soggy.  The maple glaze they offered with the fries was scrumptious.  All in all, it was Ok.  The owner was very friendly and told us all about his adventure as a new restaurant owner.  It is certainly not easy to start a new business!  I wouldn't say this concept is brand new to the Charlotte area so he may have his work cut out for him...the location may or may not be to his disadvantage.   He made it clear this was going to be all about the burgers.  He wants the burgers to speak for themselves.  They have a couple other options but he plans on removing salads from the menu.  This is a basic burger joint.  Burger. Fries. Soda. Beer.  Love it or leave it.",

Load up on the side of fries if you're looking to be full(er). 5-star for flavor, 3-star for price to portion\"   You order at the counter and there are a variety of burger options (for vegetarians and omnivores) although some additional toppings are limited for vegetarians (i.e. The Seoul burger which has bacon fries kimchi and no option to remove the bacon). I got the Quinoa Black Bean Veggie Burger with a side of the Quinoa salad.   Everything about the burger is amazing. The sauce is on point with the cheese and the sweetened pickles adds a nice flavor to it. The BUN is the best part! It's so soft and fluffy. No complaints at all on how it tasted. Not too salty either.   I'd say the only downside is that for $9.5 you get a burger the size of your fist. It's small...and at Cowbells you can definitely get larger portions for about the same price. I'm not sure why it's that expensive for a veggie burger (not using organic ingredients either) but would consider lowering the price. I hesitate on giving it a 4-star because it's just so good. 5-star for the flavor, 3-star for the price to portion ratio.",

    "text": "The way people talk about this place, I had to check it out! The menu is pretty simple with a handful of burgers of which you can choose a single or a double. They have about 2 beers on tap and a couple of others in cans. My boyfriend and I ordered the Pimento and the TNT and split them. Our favorite was the Pimento. Just pimento cheese and fried pickles but oh so good. He ordered a double of the pimento burger, but came out as a single. I can only do thin burgers so they are perfect as singles here. He would have liked a little more meat. Fries were perfect.   The cashier was nice and friendly and even warned us when the beer we ordered had not been very well received. She gave us a sample before letting us commit.   Honestly after all of the reviews and Instagram pics I have seen about this place I expected it to me more life-changing. However, it was just a pretty standard burger in my opinion. Something to be said for consistency though! I will definitely come back!",

They use local buns and everything they have there is homemade including all their sauces. The burgers were delicious. My TNT burger wasn't as spicy as I would have expected but it was still good. We also ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer, they have  tempura batter (I think) which is slightly different from others I have had.

Everything about my burger was perfect... ridiculously soft and flavorful bun + great blend of beef cooked to a good temperature + interesting toppings to compliment. You can easily tell that the owner is incredibly passionate, and making burgers is his craft. I actually got to meet Joe during my visit - he is a really nice dude who loves what he is doing. His enthusiasm for his product is unparalleled.   If you're ever in the area, or even if you have to drive an hour (like I did), definitely stop by... You won't be disappointed.  Side note: I had the 'Elvis' Burger (burger of the week) with Tempura Fried Bananas, Peanut Butter, Muenster Cheese, Banana Peppers and Bacon.... SO dope.",

I ordered the PORTABELLA & GRUYERE Burger, got a double, and asked for it \"medium.\" Well it came well done. Strike one.   Now a \"double\" here would equal most places Half-Pound burger, so get that if you're hungry (which I definitely was)! Was it tasty? Yes. Was the bun fresh and soft? NO. It was a tough chew, and I wound up leaving half of it on the table. That will NOT win you many admirerers Bang Bang! What sets others apart is the quality of the bun.....and this one really, I hate to say it, sucked! It just did. Could have been stale....I don't know. But I do know is that I couldn't eat that bun. I scraped off the meat and ate that. That was decent, and the mushroom and cheese was pretty good.  But I mean, come on Bang Bang, that bun was stale and you know it! And yet you served it.   Overall a \"meh\" experience. IF you want a GREAT burger, go to Cowfish, Diamond or the LIberty. All do great burgers!",

I ordered the Bang Bang Burger and upgraded to the grass fed beef. It came with cheese, lettuce, tomato, homemade pickle, red onion and for lack of a better descriptor, \"special sauce.\" This was a really good burger. On the side we shared the fries and the edamame, sweet potato salad. I liked the salad - it was a nice departure from typical side salady things. The fries were hand cut in-house but I just like a skinny, crispy fry. These tasted good but were on the soft side.  BBB is certainly pricey but if you upgrade to 100% grass fed beef you're going to pay more than usual. Obviously they are interested in good quality ingredients (like canola fry oil) so you should expect to pay more. I'll go back.",

The menu varies, but it does have permanent burger combinations (and a couple non-burger options).  My faves are the guacamole burger (think this is a permanent option) and the apple compote burger (relatively new).  But, seriously, any burger is going to taste fantastic.  I've had the regular fries, sweet potato fries, and house-made chips as a side, and theyre all great.  PRO TIP: get the regular potato fries and ask for the maple dipping sauce for them. The maple sauce usually comes with the sweet potato fries, but, damn, they are bangin' good with the regular fries.  Make this place a regular spot!  Actually, don't. That means I won't have to deal with a crowd ;-)",

From a taste-perspective, Bang Bang Burgers gets five stars.  The reason for three stars, though, is because of how annoying the business model of some of these craft burger places are. We get it, your burgers are far superior than the concoction that McDonald's passes off as a burger, and 90% of the people coming here are fully willing to pay $10-$15 for a burger and fries meal (I certainly am). The problem is always the portion size. If you lift, workout, or are anything but paper-thin good luck getting full off of these portions. Why not charge a little more and provide normal portions?  I do believe that the place had an option to add an extra patty, but that really does not help since, unless you have eaten here before, you have no clue how big/small the burger by itself is. Why would I order an extra patty just in case?  Again, great food, but poor portioning. Please, just charge a bit more for normal portions.",

Yelp let us to Bang Bang Burgers. The vibe of the place seems pretty hipster but with tons of families in for the food. Overall very chill and a neighborhood feel. We didn't try any of the craziness on the menu, but stuck with a good ol' bacon cheeseburger and fries. I have to say the burger was good but honestly I feel like I'm still looking for that awesome local burger place. It didn't wow me in the least; good but not memorable. What did wow me were the fries. Hand cut and fried to perfection (a little salty for my taste but still so good)!! Seriously I went on and on about how good I thought they were. I will definitely come back and try some of there other items and of course to get my fry fix!!",

My bread was also dry.  The pictures and descriptions of the sides are also deceiving.   The edamame side is mostly sweet potato.   The picture shows mostly edamame.  Not the best burger in Charlotte.  No wine.  Some beer.  No waitress.   It's a fast food joint.",

Fresh cut fries or sweet potato fries, and onion rings to die for on the side. Can't go wrong. Also, they only serve local brews, so that's a nice perk.",

Ingredients were fresh and bbq sauce was unique but delicious. The hand cut fries weren't as good as id hoped. They were fried (obviously) but didn't have too much flavor in and of themselves. I was gonna go with sweet potato fries but I decided against the $1 up charge. That's probably on me. Seating feels a little cramped as they try to fit a lot of tables into a small space. But it's not uncomfortable. I dig the vibe though and would stop in again if I was in the area.",

Don't underestimate their chicken club--it's just as delicious as the beef and veggie patties! Ask for their sweet and tangy bang bang sauce is perfect on everything, too!",

Whatever sauce they had on it was flavored well. I got the mushroom and onions which fell a little flat. Not too flavorful and overall pretty greasy. Our 15 month old did love her grilled cheese sandwich but I felt like that was pretty greasy and a little overly burnt. And there were a few flies hovering around and some mustiness to the air. I suppose for the type of place it is I shouldn't expect that much. The servers were friendly and everything did come out promptly.",

So, here is what I know:  1) Environment: atmosphere is great - mix between a restaurant and a stand-up take-out joint; about 5-6 TVs, all on different channels - including one for kids (ooh, Paw Patrol, yes please!); clean; tons of paper towels, condiments; clean and tidy bathrooms.  2) Staff: Wonderful. Efficient, friendly, ever-present but not bothersome.   3) Food: I'll say this - delicious enough that I am already thinking about the kind of burger I am going to get next time. I thought I was going to get a menu item this time after reading about it online, but, when I got there, I saw the Special: Sloppy Joe Carolina Burger. Really? How could I resist THAT? Homemade sloppy joe, homemade coleslaw, cheese, onions...good Lord. It was incredible. Love the fries - homemade with skin but not overly cooked/burned like at some places, and certainly fresh.   4) Drink: I should have gotten a beer - loved the selection. But Fountain Drinks were plenty - and the ice was nice and easily chewable.   5) Price: Little on the high side - so may not want to go on a daily basis. I got the special with only one patty for $11 and with fries and a drink it was just under $15.   Overall - excellent. I cannot wait to eat there again.",

I ordered the TNT Burger, and it was delicious. It was perfectly cooked. It was pretty spicy. It came with ghost pepper cheese, fried onion straws and sliced jalepenos. The siracha mayo came on the side, so you can control how much or little you want on your burger. The fries were great too...the perfect sidekick. I had the sweet potato fries and they came with a slightly sweet dipping sauce that I want every time I eat sweet potato fries.   The service was friendly and the all employees seemed to get along well with each other too which is something I always try to take note of.

My boyfriend ordered the TNT with fries which he demolished. That's saying something because he is a slow eater. I barely got a bit in! I got the salmon salad and sweet potato fires which was everything and more. Delicious and a great size. We were stuffed afterwords! The service is great and it's a very family friendly, relaxing atmosphere. Definitely planning on coming back here again to try the other items on their menu! Two thumbs up.",

Bang Bang was recommend...so I thought I would give it a go (again).  The customer service was great, especially considering that we arrived less than an hour before closing. The cashier encouraged us to take our time and dine in.  I ordered the Bang Bang burger sans tomato and lettuce...well done. When my burger arrived quickly I wanted to believe it was due to great service. So, here's where it gets tricky. I fully understand that a burger cooked to an internal temp of 160 is considered well done, even if it's still pink. Ugh, I know that, but I am not a fan of it. I get it. It's angus beef and you don't want to overcook it. Yet, there's something about the \"a little too pink\" patty that gets me every time.   However, the fries were perfect...really perfect. The bun from was a great pair, which was from Duke's Breads. And, they serve Fanta (while I'm not a fan of the history of this drink it is delicious).   I'm still in search of the perfect chargrilled, but Bang Bang definitely provides a few things that invite me to return.",

With so many burger and fast food places nowadays it's hard to find a burger done right. Bang bang    Burgers though, they do it right!   Upon walking in, we noticed the place was packed so we were a little worried we wouldn't have a place to sit but luckily as we got done ordering a table opened up. Even though they were busy, our food was out in 5-10 min. I ordered the single bang bang burger- medium with sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked well on the out side and perfectly medium/pink in the middle. If I was super hunger, I'd definitely try the double, but the single filled me up just fine. The sweet potatoes were crispy and had a great bite to them. They came with a white sauce which at first I thought was ranch but it was sweet and complimented the sweet potatoes so well.   You know how sometimes you try a new place and you want to try something new every time you go there- well, this isn't the case, I've found my perfect burger and I want that every time I go there.",

    "text": "More like 3.5 stars for me.  :)  We rarely go out for lunch on purpose on Saturdays or Sundays.  There has to be either a)extra cash flow and/or b) a good reason.  Going to Bang Bang Burger this past Saturday was because of both A and B.  Upon walking in, I was a little throw off by the decor and the interior set up but I quickly remembered that it's just a simple burger joint.  So then the decor made more sense.  Ordering was easy.  The menu isn't that extensive, yet, but I'm sure as they find their \"voice\" if you will, it'll grow.  I ordered the regular cheeseburger and hubs ordered another burger...I forgot.  The cool thing was that when I asked if they could just skip using a bun on mine, they told  me they could do a burger wrap.  Huh??  OK!! Let's try it.    My little burger lettuce wrap hit just the spot.  It was just the right size of meat to lettuce ratio and the meat quality was great.  It melted in my mouth.  My Hubs burger, on the other hand...was all bun...hardley any meat.  Where's the beef??  Reading the reviews, they suggest getting the double meat and it would be better.  We also order a beer (yes in the middle of the afternoon..why not?) and mine was GOOD! I think I got the one with the Monkey on it.  LOL! Can't remember the name.  The Bang Bang burger sauce was nothing more than 1,000 island dressing...which they admit to, but they make it in-house.  Sorry but it threw me back to my McDonald days and eating a big mac and it's \"special sauce\"...aka....1,000 island dressing.  I'll pass....  We spoke for a long time with Joe and we loved his passion for really wanting to bring a different type of burger joint to CLT.  We liked Bang Bang and will come back if we're ever in that area.  Great little addition to that area.",

The burger was cooked just right and had tons of flavor.  The Guacamole ranked right up there with the best I've had with a nice blend of advocados, shaved red onions, and corn salsa.  The sweet potato fries were really good but there are other places in Charlotte that have better.  I did like the fact that they are hand cut and still had the skin.  I don't think this is the best burger joint in Charlotte but it definitely ranks up there.  If I were in the judging business - which I'm not - I would put Kickstand burgers a notch above Bang Bang.  Another edge Kickstand has over Bang Bang is the ambiance.  Bang Bang has more of a fast food feel while Kickstand is more of a sit and stay for a while restaurant.",

My friend got the burger with kimchi in it, but it wasn't anything special. I think I will have to get double patty next time because the single patty burger didn't fill me up that much.   Cons: I really wish this place was bigger. I had trouble finding seating the first time I went. Also, the fries are pretty plain, nothing that special. Too many fries for the size of the burger.

I was worried it might be too spicy for me since their menu says it is spicy -- but it was not spicy at all.  The pork belly was tender and paired well with the burger.  I got my burger cooked medium and I devoured the whole thing pretty quickly.  After such a hefty burger, I thought I would feel uncomfortably full and/or food coma would set it soon after...but that wasn't the case at all.  I'm surprised more places aren't offering a burger like this! Oppa Gangam Style!",

    "text": "First off, whoever thinks these burgers are flavorless definitely has their taste buds all out of wack. Secondly, yes the meat isn't a steroid induced pile of cow, but that's why they have doubles. Giving a place a bad review due to an issue that you could have easily solved is pretty sketch. The pictures of the burgers are everywhere! And are True to size. Which is exactly why when I saw the meat size and heard my tummy rumble I opted for the double. So let me know when you open a restaurant, I'd love to complain about your forks not being shiny enough or some other nonsense.  Now onto the actual review.  As a California native, a meatatarian, burger enthusiast and an explorer of new or underrated restaurants, I was MORE than impressed. I LOVE a good burger and have been searching for the best in Charlotte for a while now. Bad Daddys definitely had the lead on that one, until now. There are 2 key elements to a good burger, the meat and well, everything else. Now having a delicious one or the other is enough to impress me, but having both? You win this round, Bang Bang.   I ordered the TNT burger because it offered something called wasabi cheddar. Being disappointed with any other Charlotte restaurant cheddar anything (processed cheddar sauce is blasphemous to the cheese Gods), I was a little nervous but wasabi makes the acids in my stomach bubble and that's ok by me. The atmosphere of the place was very calm and clean. You can tell it's new because with burgers that good the place should have been packed! We drank our delicious White Rascal (awesome selection of beer) and then in comes a ray of light from the kitchen. This burger was served on a wood plank with a hefty serving of fresh cut fries and all the fixings on the side which I loved. My burger came with deep fried jalapenos and onions which were fried to perfection. The bang bang sauce was pretty good but I completely ignored it once I discovered the amazing wasabi cheddar. Finally! A Charlotte restaurant that treats cheese with respect.  I slathered my crispy bun with wasabi and went in for the kill. Bite one caused a river of meat juices to fall onto my plank and more importantly into my mouth. WOW. The meat was beyond juicy! I almost thought I was having steak how juicy it was. Going for the double was the best idea I had all day! How that monstrosity fit in my mouth I'll never get! (That's what she said). They put what I believe to be pepper jack on the meat and was it delicious! The cheese dripped from my burger like it does on a TMNT cartoon pizza. I was in heaven. Those deep fried jalapenos and onions were definitely the cherry on top. They took onion rings to a whole new level. The fries were fresh and crisp and did a great job of supporting this succulent beast. Every bite, every juice drop down my cheek, every sniffle from the wasabi was like watching a pegasus gallop into the sunset.   The only thing that could have been done better was the pricing. It was a bit more than we expected to pay for burgers but we seemed to care less and less with each bite.  That being said, they've earned the 5 stars. They were so good, I wanted to Bang Bang the chef.",

I had the guacamole burger, medium well, with fries to go. The presentation was very good, and I appreciated the ketchup and ranch being placed in separate containers. The care and attentiveness of the staff was great as well, both on the phone and in person. But, the place is difficult to get into and out of in that strip mall, and there was hardly anyone at their place. The burger wasn't as amazing as I'd been lead to believe, the patty had no flavor, the guac and ranch/onions did add an interesting flavor but not enough to hide the flavorless patty, which I guess I could understand if you don't want too much coming at you, just different tastes I guess. The fries just plain sucked, I wished I'd substituted to quinoa. Not bad if you're in the area and don't want burger chain, maybe trying one of the other burgers will be better??",

The ingredients were fabulous and the taste was probably one of the best burgers we have had of recent. But I got the portobella burger thinking it was a portobella cap as the burger. I do not like hamburgers really and that was a slight  disappointment to realize that it was just a few mushrooms on a patty. My boyfriend gladly ate my patty. I wish we would have eaten there because our fries were cold, but that is to be expected in togo orders. The menu is extremely limited. The food is good though all in all just wish there was an actual portobella burger, not a burger with mushrooms on it.",

When I first heard of this place I figured it was just another burger spot jumping on the bandwagon with average burgers.  Charlotte rewards safe, chain like, average food establishments, and I thought that's what I would experience.  This is not the case.  It's a small, counter service, gourmet burger joint.  The food is presented very nicely, but it's the quality that really matters.  A friend and I tried two different burgers and a couple different sides.  Everything was clearly hand crafted and the additional care they take in the kitchen came through in the taste.  This is better than bad daddy's and better than five guys, and currently rates as my top burger in Charlotte.  Any foodie needs to visit and check this place off their list, it's worth it.  I'm happy to see an independent, food first place have great success in our city.  I'm so sick of seeing chains pop up and do well.  Reward the independent risk takers that clearly contribute to the culinary development of this city!!!",

The place was busy and we essentially got the last table that was immediately available but it is not a large place. Then we waited and waited.  We noted lots of other tables waiting too... The food seemed to come out in sporadic little clumps. We noted other tables would get an entree then a few minutes later another entree would arrive. After about 30 minutes a burger arrived for my husband and then about 5 minutes later my burger arrived... A bit odd. We didn't special order anything and it was burgers so I'm not exactly sure what took so long. I had the pimento burger and fries and my husband had the TNT burger and BBQ chips.  All was very tasty and fresh. Another odd thing was the \"plates\". The burgers are served on a cutting board with the fries/chips in a metal fryer style basket...this was awkward for the servers to carry and also on the table. Would I eat here again...yes.

    "text": "Located in one of my favorite neighborhoods, this is a great meeting place and of course, burger joint. The staff is knowledgeable and the owner is super cool. They served a free in-house BBQ potato chip appetizer while we waited. My friend got the Bang Bang Burger with their signature Bangburger sauce on the side with sweet potato fries with some kind of maple sauce. I got the Seoul burger with kimchi (of course) on a gluten free bun with hand cut fries. Both dishes were to die for. I had a little bit of everything (but for a bite of my friend's burger) and could have eaten ALL the fries and chips on my own. Even the beer recommendation paired with my slightly spicy burger made perfect sense. The only thing they (or rather, the private supplier) will need to work on is the oopsie bread, aka gluten free bun. I know they're hard to make sturdy enough for a heavy wet burger. I'm just thankful they have the option at all.",

    "text": "I gave Bang Bang a try last weekend and it was just OK, but worth more visits. I agree with some of the other reviews about the ratio of beef to bun - heavily skewed toward bun.   The guacamole burger had a great presentation and the accompanying BBQ house chips were great. The flavor was there, but it left me craving more guac, corn, and red onion.   I appreciate thinner beef patties, but the bun was too much. I am not a fan of the bun itself; it was a bit too airy. I prefer a bun on the denser side that holds up to a burger and all the toppings.   The staff was great; they explained the menu to us and were friendly. I also liked the feel and decor - warm and inviting.",

    "text": "The hubs and I decided to try this place out on a particularly icky rainy Sunday afternoon. Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that.   We tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it. Well except for Chinese broccoli, but that's another post.).   So final opinion is that this is definitely the best burger joint we've seen in CLT so far, but it could use a few improvements like smaller buns for singles and a build your own burger option on the menu.",

    "text": "We went here for a good burger.  I have Celiac disease and need everything strictly gluten free, so finding a good burger can be challenging.   Their food was great.  The gluten free bun (made by a local baker) was especially good, perhaps the best part. I got the (GF) cowboy burger with a side of the edamame salad.  The burger was well cooked and the bacon nice and crispy. The salad had a nice, bright, citrus flavor.  The burger patty is pretty small but the cheese was stretchy and good.  I felt there could have been a little more of everything, and left a bit hungry.    If you're celiac, no fries for you, but that's not uncommon.  One server knew more than another about providing food for me, but she stepped in and helped out and all staff were very considerate and welcoming.   My dinnermate got the normal fries with the bang bang burger and thought both were very good was well.  He got a double, which seems to have been a good idea.  There were only two beers on tap (and no other adult beverages to be seen) so that was limiting, but it was a family environment and there are plenty of places in the area to grab a drink.   All in all, I'd definitely go back.  They were attentive and the food was good.",

Also, it's kind of a buzzkill when you hafta pay for extra condiments which make the meal you're paying for better.  If a burger with a tiny bit of Gochujang mayo versus one with a decent amount makes the burger that much better you shouldn't have to pay extra.",

Atmosphere: order at the front, sit down, and they bring your food to our table. It's an upscale fast food setup, like a Zoe's Kitchen or Panera.   Burgers: I ordered the daily special, which was a burger (I upgraded to the grass fed beef), Mac and cheese and Sriracha dusted honey bacon on a bun. The burger by itself was mouth-watering and the bacon was a great mix of sweet and smokey. The Mac and cheese was a good consistency with hint of relish. I absolutely loved the burger and it was not too filling. My husband got the Seoul burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed.    Sides: the broccoli and garlic was very good,however I was hoping for more. The only downside to our visit was the French fries, they were a little too greasy for my liking.  Overall, this place was a great find....will definitely stop by to try more delicious burgers!",

The restaurant is small and parking can be a hassle but it's worth it. I'd like to compare Bang Bang to a smaller less expensive Bad Daddy's.",

The burger itself is very well seasoned and was cooked perfectly to the requested temp - medium well.  I had the special of the day, the Carolina Panthers Burger, which was topped with sharp cheddar, pulled pork, BBQ sauce, coleslaw, and fried onion strings.  Each component was done well on its own. My wife even commented about how good the bun was.  The french fries were also fantastic!  I hate undercooked, soggy fries and these were thankfully the complete opposite.  There are few things better than a perfectly crispy french fry.  The restaurant is smaller than it should be.  It's a fast-casual setup, but maybe a little too casual. The back hallway was crammed full of supply shelves but they were tastefully covered by black curtains. The men's room also seems to serve as a storage space. There were CO2 tanks, a ladder, and other similar accoutrements.  I understand the need to store these things in plain sight but it will be nice to see this place at its full potential in a proper restaurant space one day.",

I just had to cheat to get the whole experiences.  At any given day, you will see the owner whose famously created his weekly burger at the restaurant.

The burgers were super-juicy and DEE-Lish...and so were the fries.  I even liked the overall rustic-style presentation (check out my pics).  I also had to try their \"Cheeseburger Eggroll\"...Very cute concept, with cute presentation as well!  The only thing that can be improved is SPACE.  The place was very small, and way too crowded for comfort.  I could hear every word the people next to me had to say (and vice versa, I'm sure).  I think the owner should think about expanding this little burger joint to a bigger facility, possibly even opening up several branch locations.  Yes, THAT good!  PS**I spoke too soon...I just checked their website, and they do have a second location in Southend Charlotte now!",

The burgers are grass fed and taste so amazingly fresh, and the combinations of special burgers are simply awesome! I had the pimento cheese and fried pickle burger that was so tasty it lacked nothing and needed no additional toppings!  My husband had the Seoul 2 burger with Kim che , pork belly, and  Korean style pickles, and Bulgogi sauce. This burger had so much going on but was loaded with flavor!  In a word, Delicious! Only downside, very dark parking lot.",

Medium not great.  Wonderful service, nice folks, great French fries but over priced mediocre burgers. The kids menu was well priced and kids seemed to be very happy there which made their parents happy.",

Burger was moist and perfectly cooked and bun was soft and lightly toasted. The onion rings were not to my liking. They were battered instead of crumb breaded which caused them to be very greasy to me. I'll definitely return when I'm in the mood for a really good beef burger.",

Flavors were on point, juicy, great grilled flavor, cooked medium just like we ordered. You can tell the it is quality meat. Fresh brioche bun was excellent as well. Toppings were good, cooked properly, but the small quantity reduces the amount of flavor they add to burger. Sweet potato fries were tasty, they come with maple sauce that looks like marshmallow fluff. Fries could have been a little more crispy, sauces were great ( we ordered an extra side of chipotle ranch as well).  Service was good, food was prepared quickly. Place was about 1/3 full. Several people sitting and handful were in and out getting to go orders.  My one qualm was the size. The burgers are not that big. For $10-12ish dollars for a single patty (add $1-2 surcharge depending on what side you get) I wasn't really full. I'm sure the double patty would take care of that, but it cost 3 bucks more.  Bottom line, one of best burger patties I've ever hard, solid toppings, great bun, ok value due to size of burger and small amount of toppings. We will go back, but I still give Bad Daddy's the edge.",

Fries being fresh cut and crispy made it the perfect well balanced indulgence. The integrity of the burger itself prevails here so the idea is to use as few toppings and sauces (ie ketchup) as necessary so that you can appreciate the quality of the burger. And it works- beautifully! Please come to South Charlotte!",

Very good first visit and looking forward to returning  Update 5/18:  came back and food was again very good. However, this time we waited an eternity for our food. My best guess is 25-30 minutes for 2 burgers and fries. Luckily I was with my lovely wife and we weren't in a hurry but these are burgers and fries it should never take 30 minutes. For that reason, dropping down a star",

The menu offers burgers that will blow your mind and taste palate as well.  It is kept very clean in the dining area, but the bathroom could use a bit of TLC.  I absolutely LOVE their salads and try to have one at least once per week.  The lighting is what I would call \"mood lighting\" with booths that have TONS of space and tables to meet your dining needs.    Recently, I called in an order for a salad and when I arrived a computer glitch didn't send the order to the kitchen so it wasn't ready.  Mike, the cashier, apologized and gave me a 5 dollar discount on the order as well as a free beverage.  I didn't ask for this nor did I expect it!  It was unexpected and rare in the fast food industry to have this type of awesome service.    This is a business that works hard to keep your business!!  I would recommend Bang Bang Burgers to anyone wanting to try a place that offers quality product at reasonable prices with EXCELLENT service!!   Let Mike know he is doing a great job!!  He defiantly earned my repeat business.",

The TNT burger was the best, make it a double with lettuce/tomato/guacamole and it was to die for.  I also got the quinoa side salad instead of fries.

Today I had the awesome Bang Bang Burger, rather bang bang salmon because you know you can substitute salmon or black bean burger for any of the burgers. PS. Get it with the cilantro mail. It is amazing!! I had my usual side of quinoa salad. It is the best quinoa salad and Charlotte in my opinion. I'm leaving another review of this awesome establishment because I wanted to make SURE that I and point out one of their newest staff members. Well, as I have found out she's not new to bang bang, but she is new to this location, the location that I frequent all the time. Her name is Noel. She is charismatic and funny and sarcastic (if you give it to her she will give it back in a friendly manner) LOL. I've been there once or twice in the middle of the kids night on Tuesdays. With all of the kids and families it is organized chaos to say the least. She handles the families and the kids and the busyness with an incredible friendly and thorough and professional manner. She is very knowledgeable and informative to returning families as well as new families. Do yourself a favor and come to this establishment, bring your kids to the establishment and tell Noel that Dave sent you.",

Bingo!  The place is small inside, so I have a feeling sometimes it gets quite busy. You order at the counter and then seat yourselves.   We ordered the Gangnam style burger and the pimento cheese burger. We got one with regular fries and one with sweet potato fries. The pimento cheese burger was definitely the hero. The gangnam style burger wasn't as great as we had hoped. We expected a bit more from the pork belly. The fries were perfectly crispy and yummy. Bang bang sauce is a must.   Overall, great burgers. Next time, I think we will get a double pimento cheese instead of two singles to split b/c the pimento cheese was the star.",

We placed a detailed order over the phone and were able to pick up in just 10 minutes. Unfortunately, when we got back to the house my friend bit into his burger and discovered that it was medium rare. When we placed the order we had requested well-done. I called the restaurant to let them know about the issue and told them I could come back to pick up my correct order. They were very nice and even gave me a $5 gift card for the inconvenience, along with replacing the burger.  Once we got the correct order it was absolutely delicious. My chicken sandwich was cooked PERFECTLY (not dry, like many) and their sweet potato fries were delish.  I will definitely be back to Bang Bang Burgers. Even if their food wasn't so yummy, I'd be back just because their customer service was so spot-on.",

It was a little busy when we came but that was no problem. It was nice seeing everyone enjoying their food and conversations.   The lady who took my order was very friendly. I learned something new when I placed my order. When I ordered my burger, she asked how I wanted my egg cooked. I have never been asked that before. I have had countless burgers with eggs and never have I ever been asked how I wanted the egg cooked. I felt ridiculous asking her what her question meant, but I decided to ask anyways. She did not laugh, she enlightened me on what it meant. I learned that how I like it would be considered \"medium\". She taught me something and I was super excited about it. I ordered the Hang Over Burger with fries and my sister ordered the Chicken club with sweet potato fries. The food was DELICIOUS. It came out in decent timing and was presented in a nice manner! We loved the presentation. So different then a lot of places. Highly recommend.",

There is a small parking lot out front of the tiny strip mall where this restaurant is located and street parking on the side streets if needed. We easily found parking out front, but we came during the week.   Once you go inside, you order your food at the counter, they give you a number, you find a seat, and they bring you the food.   There are notes on the tables that make it seem that it fills up and can get very busy, but we came here on a Wednesday night before the dinner rush (5:30pm) and we easily found a table.   I ordered the pimento burger and my friend ordered the bang bang burger. All of the burgers come with crispy golden fries!The bang bang burger had a spicy bbq sauce that went perfectly with the bacon and cheese. I fell in love with the pimento burger flavors and will definately be ordering it again!",

By that I mean burger with cheese lettuce tomato and onions. I did add the bang sauce. I have to admit it didn't actually do anything for me. It seemed complicated. So many different textures and flavors that didn't exactly meld together. None the less the burger was good by itself. My wife got the mushroom and Swiss and loved it so that's a plus. She also got the sweet potato fries which were pretty great. I got the regular fries and honestly they left me wanting to add salt. There was no flavor to them at all. Overall we want to come back and try different burgers but consider adding some kind of salt or seasoning to your fries. Definitely worth going here.",

(Thumbs up) we came around 1pm on a Tuesday and it was empty. They have gluten free burger buns for those who like that kinda of stuff, lol....Overall this place is a must do, i will def be coming back to try other burgers. Thanks guys!!",

Location: this eatery is located on the back end of a small shopping center, not hard to find. They have seating outside, but I chose to sit inside. The booths and tables are relatively close, but not uncomfortable. I love the fact that the menu is simple, easy to follow. Food: I got the hangover burger with chicken. It was delicious. It was hot, the bun was toasted just enough, my egg was like I asked it to be (over medium); just overall great! It came with hand cut fries (so good) and a mayo based sauce that was also good.  This establishment bet bonus points for having Texas Pete on hand! Service: the staff was really friendly; no complaints.  I'll definitely be back on my next trip to the Queen City.",

It's not a very big place so seating is somewhat limited if there's a crowd. The interior is average and we felt comfortable dining in. My cheeseburger was good--juicy and just the right size for me. Although I ordered it well-done it was delivered to me medium-well, but that's okay because it was still very good. My fries were average. Our wait time was pretty short.  If you're in the mood for a burger I'd suggest you give Bang Bang Burger a shot. We might stop back in if we are in the area, but I find it somewhat pricey for a burger and fries and thus we wouldn't make it a regular spot to eat.",

The cashier casually reminded me of their awards when asked for recommendations so no pressure! I decided to go with the pimento double cheese burger with a side of fries. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium, grabbed my drink and waited patiently.  When the burger came I slathered some sauce on with the little spoon and dug in. Surely it couldn't be as good as advertised right?!? Wrong!  This burger was all that and a bag of chips! Probably THE BEST burger I've had this year.  Perfectly cooked. All the flavors worked. Like a party in my mouth. Oh and the fries...the fries...crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   I know I just set the bar high....but they can deliver...right?!?",

I should have asked the name of the woman helping me at the front but I forgot.  I got the weekly special and the burger was quality and tasted delicious. The presentation was equally great. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wanted a medium burger and mine was pretty well done. It still tasted amazing but that's an important thing to me. Definitely stop by for a casual meal (saw a lot of people stopping in to pick up to-go orders and I bet these babies are good with some red wine)..",

My kids have eaten here quote a bit and like it.  Here is my assessment of the pimento cheese burger:  The fried pickles had so much breading I could not taste the pickle, took them off the burger after the first bite - there are a lot of fried pickle in Elizabeth, so if you are going to do them they better be right.  I would have like some more pimento cheese, it had mostly melted off the meat when I got my burger.  That being said, the burger is delicious...I want them to get the other things right, I want this place to stay.  Fries, also, are very good, I mean close to five guys good.   Taste and seem homemade.  Fix the toppings guys, I love this place and want to be walking to it ten years from now",

This came with the Bang Bang sauce which, like others have stated is basically 1000 island dressing (I liked it better with just ketchup & mustard). The second time (last night) I tried the Cowboy burger. While I was waiting for my order they gave me a sample of some of their homemade BBQ chips which were quite tasty. I really enjoyed the Cowboy Burger, the BBQ sauce tasted homemade & had a little kick. The homemade fries here are also really good. The staff & owner are very friendly & welcoming. They are also very helpful with any questions about the menu. I live right across the street from this place so I think I will definitely be back.",

They had basic burgers for the less adventurous in my group and some more exciting ones for those of us who like to try new things. I really love that they use Duke's Bread. He's a lovely local gentleman who I get my bread from at the farmer's market. There was also a specialty burger using Olde Mecklenburg Brewery beer for beer cheese. They have to local draft selections, as well. It's order at the counter style so it can be a quick in and out if needed. The fries were great!",

    "text": "I've been here twice, once to dine in and tonight I ordered to go. The first time around I ordered the guacamole burger. It was delicious! While we waited for our food they brought out a sampling of their homemade BBQ chips - also delicious and appreciated. My friend ordered the same thing, but was disappointed in the size of the patty in proportion to the bun. I didn't mind. The burger and toppings to bun ratio worked just fine for me. If there had been more meat, I probably would have needed more guac to compensate. Just saying.   Tonight, I ordered the Seoul burger. After an incredibly long day at work, it was amazing. Though, I was searching for the bulgogi sauce. I'm not so sure it made it onto my burger. This time I definitely noticed the petite-ness of the patty. I would say that the bun extended over the beef patty by about an inch. It is a pretty great bun, by the way. Even with the beef deficit, it was tasty. I will order it again. Like others have said, you kind of need to order a double. A single is probably only 1/2 of what you want out of a good burger and also kind of a tease. The bang bang sauce is dope. It's like 1000 island's cousin, but really, who cares? Eat it. You'll like it.   I don't have much to say about their decor or the physical layout. It's fine, nothing particularly special or memorable. I don't know about you, but I go to restaurants to eat. So, unless a restaurant has a sanitation issue, I couldn't care less about how it looks. Both times, the staff have been friendly and super helpful.",

    "text": "I really think Bang Bang Burgers burgers are the best in town. Bang Bang is little place on the edge of Elizabeth/Plaza Midwood in a weird little shopping center across from Crisp. It's one of those places that looks like a place you would definitely pass on by if it wasn't for the Yelp reviews. I was really hungry when I got there so perhaps my judgment was slightly impaired so I tried it a second time to be sure. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger (upgraded to 100% grass fed beef), a gluten free bun (not, gluten sensitive but limiting wheat in my diet these days) and of course the fries. The burger was just soooo good it's hard to adequately explain in words -- and the fries, only slightly less wonderful than the burger, did not disappoint. Everything, EVERYTHING! was ridiculously good. I left feeling like I just had one of the best meals ever (because, at the end of the day, is there anything better than meat & potatoes?)  With my \"upgrades\" I spent about $15 and it was well worth it.   When I returned, I ordered one of the veggie burgers. It wasn't bad at all but it was what it was. If you are a meat eater, do yourself a favor and get the burger @ Bang Bang. Enjoy!!",

The pimento cheese was creamy, but a bit bland. I could've done without the fried pickles on it. They were sweet and a bit soggy. I was hoping for salty and crunchy. The housemade chips and ranch were really good. For 3 people, we spent about $45 on burgers and drinks. I found that to be a tad expensive, mostly because this isn't exactly a sit-down restaurant. There's no patio and it's a small space. You order at a counter and get a number. So, I feel there are better burgers with better atmosphere for that kind of cash. On the plus side, it's kid and family friendly. I suppose if I'm over that way and need a quick bite, I'd try it again.",

It is all highly overpriced for what you get.  I've had better, less expensive burgers elsewhere. It's also a big turnoff that you have to pay extra for grass-fed beef. I won't be returning...",

The double seems like the better choice if you're hungry.  I loved the taste of the burger and the fries and the customer service was awesome but it just seems like something was missing. I left not feeling satisfied, maybe it was the value, portions, etc.  Ill surely go back and try some of the other combo's but when I want a burger, Bad Daddy's and Liberty will continue to be my go to spots.",

I've tried the Cowboy burger and the special Mexicali burger.  Both were great.  I've seen some complaints on the burger size in other reviews and they are definitely smaller than some places (I'm guessing 1/4 pound size for a single); however, I certainly find the size to be sufficient when you pair it up with a side item.  The overall quality of the meat is great, and the ingredient combinations on the various burgers are excellent.  I'm a big fan of sweet potato fries and this place has the BEST ones I've had, especially when eating them with the accompanying maple white sauce.  I don't know exactly what's in this sauce but it is heavenly.  The only real knock I have on this place is it's located in a strip mall, and has a vibe similar to Five Guys or any other chain.  Great for lunch or hanging out with your bros, but I wouldn't take a date here.",

Chef Joe makes this place awesome and we loved talking with him; he even gave us free samples of their hand-cut sweet potato fries with maple syrup/sour cream/mayo dip, and BBQ chips to try. This is the first place we'll take family and friends when they come to visit us in Charlotte!",

They get their beef from a butcher in NYC and it is very good. Not a huge patty but you do have the easy option to add a 2nd patty. Their buns are from Local Loaf in the 7th St. Market. Two things are great about this. 1st the bread is so good!! it's got good texture and a flaky buttery top. It's made fresh everyday. 2nd is that it's from Local Loaf.   The ambiance was cool. Nice contemporary lighting. Nice wooden eating tables and planting of seating. They also had a good beer selection. This is a great addition to the burger scene in CLT.  Oh and really good fries too!",

Today I killed the curiosity and decided to go in- I ended up ordering the bang bang burger. Let's just say it wasn't what I expected.  It was good, I love that it's grass fed beef and all but flavor was really lacking with this one.  I didnt look into what bang bang sauce was, but its thousand island dressing..... not even what I imagined! I would've told them to hold that mess!  I'm also going to agree with a few others and say that a lot of bread comes with this smaller portioned burger patty.   It was sort of slow while I was there-  so maybe that explains the boring attitudes from the workers, the cashier was friendly though!  Im not rushing back,  slightly disappointed :(",

The set up is simple. The menu is simple. A simple menu has perhaps allowed them to focus on what they do best. The burgers were amazing!   Each burger is cooked to order, with simple ingredients (hand made pickles were my favorite topping). The flavors were perfect, they tasted so fresh, down to the tomato and lettuce. They also have an array of simple sauces that come with certain burgers, or you can request on the side, they pack a lot of punch! I think they were homemade? They were so yummy.   I loved the sauce that came with the Bang Bang Burger, and the BBQ with the Cowboy Burger was amazing. They topped the burgers perfectly.   The fries were also great! Though I had to put a little extra salt - they were nice and crisp.   Nothing was overly greasy, burnt, or undercooked. I dare to say it was a perfect meal.   I can see the complaints about price over quantity. I agree it is a tad over priced - but luckily for me I left full and happy. Maybe opt for the double if you're super hungry ( though I suppose this doesn't help with the price predicament).   Service was fast and friendly, I will definitely we back. I was so pleasantly surprised. Thanks yelpers for convincing me to try!",

Since it was our first time, the cashier introduced us to the menu and their beer selection.  I settled on the Bang Bang burger, medium, single patty.  It was the perfect size (I cannot stand thick patties) and cooked to perfection.  The meat was so juicy and flavorful.  I tried the Bang Bang sauce by itself- it's some sort of relish, mayo, concoction- and I didn't really like it but when I spread it on the bun it brought the entire burger together in a glorious way!  These guys really know what they are doing!  I liked that the fries were homemade but I would have preferred a little more uniformity.  By the time I got to the bottom, my fries looked more like little shreds of potato.  But whatever, I went for the burger and I was not disappointed.  I can't go without mentioning that no one at our table said a word as we were devoured our food.  There was no time for conversation- my only focus was savoring each bite!

Okay, well...I wasn't so merry after walking out of Heist Brewery while overhearing the hostess tell someone there was gonna be a 1:45 minute wait. I would have disappeared from hunger by then so no thanks! Note to self...reservations exist for a reason! But that's a whole other review. To be continued. Back to BBB. Rolled up around 8ish. It's your standard seat yourself setup for fast food. Nice crowd. As a matter of fact there was standing room only. Mama always said that was a good sign of good food! So we order our food to go as there was no place to seat. The space in this place is limited but that's okay we accept it & move on. The atmosphere is laid back. We put in our orders which are promptly taken. Service is decent. By the time it was almost time for our food to be up the crowd had thinned a little so we decided to dine in. The staff had no eye rolling or sucking of teeth about this change. Thumbs up. Food came up fast. Thumbs up. I ordered the Hangover burger med well w/a over easy egg & side of fries. OMG! Fries...delicious! Hurry up and review the burger you say?! I was saving the best for last. Their burger hit the bullseye for what a really great burger should be. The only metric I'm using for this is my taste buds & not some snobby foodie scientific method. Its just a damn good burger. Period. I'm a ketchup freak and there was no need 2 apply. FYI get your beer fix somewhere else though b/c a 12oz local beer ran around $7! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOuch.So&s=12e5ee7c36137bbf233ad8037a55612f50e6b47238e1675ab5715acd346a6a86\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ouch.So</a> people come for the food,stay for the burgers.",

House made chips are pretty good. There are a number of toppings to customize your burger. Quick service, easy to park, straight forward. It's one of my go-to burger joints. Oh! And the burgers are served on delicious locally made brioche buns!",

Second trip... burgers were smaller. Again, $15 bucks for a double, fries and drink. Third and final visit... burgers were literally the size sausage patties. The bun  had plenty of room all the way around.  The waitress tried to tell me the longer they cook the burger the smaller they get. I ordered them medium. For me Elizabeth deserves a much better burger joint, and a much better price point. And the bang bag sauce is 1000 Island dressing. Nothing fancy.",

I had the bang bang, my son the cowboy, wife had a burger bowl with the upgraded grass fed beef and daughter had the cheeseburger egg roll. We had BBQ chips as an appie. All aound solid. Good local beers too. I am a medium rare guy and was at first disappointed when they said medium was a low as they could go. I asked for as close as I could get to medium rare. Gotta tell you, they got close. Juicy, reddish, and tasty. Fries were excellent. Bang bang sauce is like a spicier Russian dressing. If you aren't a kid person, avoid Tuesday as it is kids eat free night. We didn't know and just stumbled into it. Eorkwd out well since my faughter ate free!  Would go back, and recommend to anyone in a heart beat.",

As delicious as hospital food is, I needed a walk and something good.  To put in perspective I was exhausted and anything would have probably been pretty good, but WHOA.  I got the Hangover and WOW!  Some folks throw an egg on a burger and declare it fantastic.  It enhanced  the burger sure, but it was the meat.  Some claim to have the meats... They do.  Clean, lush, seasoned, perfectly cooked. I don't care where it's from.  It's the best pure burger out there.  The bangbang sauce works well with the fries.  I can say it has been a while since I got FRESH hand cut fries done right.  If you're going to bother do it right.  They did.  How eye opening was a simple late dinner of a burger and fries?  I was back the very next day.  This time I gave in to the lure of the pimento burger. It had fried pickles.  First time ever I had a fried pickle that was worth a damn. They made me like them and educated me to the fact that they don't have to be overcooked over salty pucks.  I'd like just a side of those sometimes.  Other people swoon over them but they should let BangBang convert them.     I was more than pleasantly surprised and try to recruit as many diciples as possible to this semi hidden gem in Elizabeth.  Atmosphere is relaxed and not quite as divey as my regular haunts. I can take the upgrade. Service was fast and friendly.  It all pales compared to that burger.",

Broccoli and garlic had minimal seasoning and I would pass.    My only complaint was that the single burger patty was so thin (smaller than a mcdonalds single burger party) that I really did not taste any burger flavor.  This is a shortcoming as if I truly want to taste the burger I would have to go elsewhere or get a double burger.  The flavors of the other items were great - just add a bit more meat.",

I walked up to the counter, got a hello from the cashier and a single question \"have you ever been here before?\"...\"No.\"...\"Great!  Welcome!  Let me walk you through the menu.\"  They have nice variety of burgers that all come with fries (I hate having to pay $9 for a burger and then having to pay additional for a side).  For a slight upcharge (between $1-$1.50), you can get a different side.  Their other options aren't all fried whatevers.  They actually have items like quinoa and broccoli!  I chose to do the upcharge for broccoli and it was really good.  I just went with the Bang Bang burger.  They were happy to sub the cheese for me.  I think next time, I'm going to try the hangover.  I'm a sucker for a burger with an egg on it.  Burger wasn't massive, but a decent size.  Perfect for me, since I'm not in a competitive eating contest eating a triple patty burger the size of my face.  Burger tasted great.  Good flavor and nice and juicy!    The food came out super fast.  I got my burger To-Go, and I got my food within 5-10 minutes (just long enough to watch a little TV and read a few things on my phone).  Overall, I was satisfied with the taste of my burger and side.  The service was great for to-go orders.  I don't know if the super casual ambiance would draw me in to actually eat there, but I'll definitely be placing more to-go orders in the future.  Thanks for making my list for repeat burger joints in Charlotte!",

The burgers here are fantastic for fast-casual, and their sides are solid as well (fries, onion rings, and - get this - broccoli when you're feeling marginally healthier). I generally call ahead while on the way there, and my order is always ready on arrival as little as ten minutes later.  I go with the TNT Burger (which, since a menu shakeup early this year, is genuinely spicy) and have turned a number of co-workers on to it as well. They offer single and double patties, and the single is generally more than enough for me. I've done the double patty a couple of times and it tends to 1) overwhelm the rest of the preparation and 2) leave me somewhat uncomfortably full. I switch between the fries (which should be eaten while warm, since they lose a lot as they cool down) and onion rings (which taste great but are just a bit oily and can weigh me down post-meal) as a general rule, but can attest for the healthier alternative as well. The broccoli is al dente enough to deliver a nice crunch. Which is cool and unexpected at a burger joint.  I can't speak to eating there since I always do take-out, but it seems like the folks who are doing so are having a fine time for the bare-bones environment.  Food grade: 5. They make some fine burgers. Experience: 4. It is what it is, and and issue in this area is wildly outweighed by the burgers.",

    "text": "My coworker and I have been in a long disagreement over the best burger in Charlotte. There was a time a couple years ago that I thought it was the 704 burger from RiRa's, but they have sadly since let me down. So when we were planning a lunch catch up we decided to take the trip down to Elizabeth for bang bang burgers. Parking in the area is not easy. We arrived at 11:40 and were just barley able to grab a spot in the complex. We arrived and it was pretty empty. I ordered the special which was a blue cheese burger and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries and the dipping sauce were amazing. For the burger, I really loved all of the toppings. Everything was fresh and flavorful. They also do an amazing job not over cooking the thin patties. However, my mind was not blown. I did not love the bun. I felt they were dry and didn't complement the burger very well. I did love the vibes and definitely do not regret my bang bang burger lunch, but I'm still waiting for my favorite burger in the queen city.",

It wasn't overly busy when we arrived but I appreciated the dedicated parking that allowed us to get right in without driving around the block a dozen times like a lost dominoes pizza delivery person. (Notice the gender neutral noun- you're welcome ladies) Ordering was a cinch. Small deliberate menu and it really shows off they do a small number of items really really well. Ordered the hangover burger with tempura onion rings. Burger was phenomenal. Juicy hot and super flavorful even without the bang bang sauce. Adding the sauce just made it even better. I also got a side of pimiento cheese and it was sensational as well. Presentation was nice on a carving board with a metal basket of onion rings. The rings were light and crispy and delicious. I can't find one thing I didn't like. We will definitely be back to enjoy another option.",

I had their burger at the Moo & Brew festival but if I am being completely honest, I was feeling pretty good after all those beer samples. So I couldn't write a review because 1- I wasn't sober enough to critique it and anything would have tasted divine at that moment, and 2- I wouldn't have remember what it tasted like.  Hands down the best burger in all of Charlotte. It's a walk up and order style restaurant with maybe 3 or 4 taps.  The lady that took my order was helpful and gave me the run down on the most popular burger. I of course ordered the Bang Bang Burger with a OMB Copper.  First, what is that Bang Bang sauce because I want to put it on everything. Wow!!! And second, where has this place been all my life. It is no surprise that they have won the best burger at the Moo & Brew fest two years in a row. If you haven't ventured out to Elizabeth to give this burger a try, you're missing out!  Cheers to extra hours at the gym and becoming a regular at this joint.",

I follow a mostly Paleo diet, so most places I go I have to find something on the menu and make a dozen changes to it (burger no bun, no cheese, no sauce, extra veggies ...). So I love that this place has a burger bowl that is more than big enough to fill me up. It comes in a huge salad bowl which is great for mixing, and comes on a bed of spinach with cubed sweet potatoes, avocado, bacon, tomato, onion, hardboiled egg, and a grass-fed beef burger patty for about $13. It's a ton of food, and I usually can't finish it all so I ask for the lemon-olive oil dressing on the side and pack up about half of the salad in a to-go box.   And the last time I was there, I had to wait a couple of extra minutes for my food to be brought out after my boyfriend's was brought out, so they gave us a small gift card to apologize for the inconvenience. So sweet!",

The menu is small (I like places that do a couple things well, instead of bunch of things mediocre - Thanks Bang Bang!) and I was just looking for a quick snack.  Their onion rings are super yummy with a nice crisp to the batter and thick cuts of tender onion.  Really hit the spot, especially paired with a cold, local beer.  Service was friendly and fast and the restaurant was clean.  The employees are quick to clear up the next table, which is great since this is a limited dining area. Parking is a B---- in this lot.  Very limited spaces and I'm told to be very cautious where you choose to park, as they definitely tow.  Oh!  Get the Bang Bang sauce.  On everything.  you're welcome ;-)",

Download the \"Stealz\" app on your phone. It's easy and worth free fries. Their fries here are good! And they have like 3 flavors (reg, sweet potato, and a garlic kind?). *BURGERS: they have different options listed that you can alter which what kind of bun you want, meat you want (you pay extra for grassfeed beef, but nice to have that option). Also have vegan options. Build your own options. *BEER: they do have like 2-3 drafts usually from somewhere within the area. One night they have a special on a pint but I can't remember which night. *SERVICE: every time I've went we've had someone nice and patient. You order at the counter, pay, sign/tip on the iPad, and they bring your order out to you. *TRY: their fries, I like their sweet potato fries which they serve with some kind of good sauce on the side. I also like their pilmento burger, so if you like that cheese they have a good one they top on their burger (not too runny/melted some places).",

It was  literally the same size patty for double the cost.  And it could be just me, but I felt like the place was still trying to define itself... Like it wanted to serve \"high class\" fare with a \" low class\"  ambiance. Unfortunately,  the only thing high class about it was the price.",

There's not a ton of options, but the ones they have all sounded really good. I ended up getting the Cowboy burger, but was actually disappointed - to me the \"BBQ sauce tasted way more like tomato pasta sauce. So in reality, I just had a bacon cheeseburger... But a really good bacon cheeseburger. The bun was perfectly toasted, the bacon was perfectly crispy, and the patty was actually just a tiny bit over medium. (I requested it medium, and they were closer than other burger places we've tried.) My husband ordered the guacamole burger and loved it - and his was actually a prefect medium. (He decided to not get the ranch dressing that normally comes on it though.)  The Bang Bang Sauce is awesome though!  We also ordered onion rings and sweety potato fries.  Skip the rings (slightly underdone and super greasy), but the sweet fries were really good and they come with their own sauce (maple cream - definitely try it. )  The patties are pretty thin, and it's a little expensive for what you get, but all in all, we were happy we tried it, and will likely be back.",

I truly believe they have changed their source to lower quality to handle the higher demand they've received recently.

Nope - it's just a perfectly cooked patty between two halves of a golden poppyseed bun, served with the usual toppings and a side of special sauce. But it's quite simply one of the best meals you'll have in the Queen City.  After reading on a local website about Bang Bang's claim to the Charlotte Burger Title, we dropped by on a recent Saturday afternoon and were pretty much blown away. My kids, picky eaters to the last, devoured every last bite of their burgers, and were raving about the meal for days (OK, maybe just hours ... but that's still huge). My only complaints were the fries (overdone and bland) and the very limited beer selection (just a couple of taps and one local brew in cans) -- not nearly enough choices to wash down this fabulous meal.  The restaurant itself is nothing to get excited about.  A cozy little dive in an unassuming strip mall on 7th Street, it has limited seating, but tables turn quickly. Which is a really good thing, because you'll won't want to wait for these fantastic burgers any longer than you have to.",

They were cooked to order, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. The fries were also good and there were a ton of condiments available. The prices were more than reasonable and everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful.   Two things that would've made this place better - a bigger beer selection and better desserts. We bought a cookie to share but it was so dry and hard that we ended up throwing it away.   All around, this place was great and we will be back soon.",

While all the ingredients where definitely fresh, the size of the patty for the price you're paying left a taste of rip-off.  $13 bucks is $13 bucks for a burger, regardless of whether you spend it at cowbell, or bang Bang.  You're definitely not getting your $13 worth here.",

Unlike most burger joints which disguise mediocre meat with a slew of random toppings, Bang Bang burger patties are in and of themselves quite tasty, so the toppings are supplementary.   The patty was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and placed between a deliciously soft, toasted  bun. It was burger perfection! I found the pickles a little on the sweet side, but overall, it was a great burger experience.",

Unfortunately the fries have been off the last couple of times - they're harder/crispier now. The innovation is also less frequent, with weekly specials usually recycled from previous ones.  Look forward to continuing to drop in from time to time, but there are also several other good burger places around now that may be worth trying.",

    "text": "As often as I visit Spa & Nail next door, I have to exercise some serious willpower to not visit Bang Bang more often than I already do.  The burgers here are a real treat. I like that the menu isn't vast and expansive -- it makes me feel as though everything that is offered is curated and intentional. I've sampled a handful of the burgers over different trips and I've always been pleased with my choice. My go-to is typically the Hangover, because I can't turn down a burger with a fried egg on top. On my last visit, my date had the Bleu Burger on special, and the bacon jam/bleu cheese mixture on top made my eyes roll back. So good.  The only things keeping me from giving Bang Bang five stars are due to my gluten free lifestyle. Since a basic burger and fries won't work for me, I add a GF bun and swap quinoa for my side, and it tacks several dollars onto the bill. I'm not bothered paying around $10 for a burger, but as my total price starts creeping toward $15, it makes for a pricey lunch. Also, I understand that the gluten free buns are baked locally. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but in this case I really wish Bang Bang would go with a national supplier -- the GF buns here are dry and fall apart in my hands, while the Udi's buns at Smashburger always hold up and have better texture and flavor.   To end on a high note, though, I'm all about the new rewards program Bang Bang has started. It's linked to your credit card, so you don't have to carry around some sort of loyalty punch card in your wallet or recite your phone number -- as long as you use the same credit card each time, your rewards are automatically tabulated. Easy peasy.  Oh! And you can order Bang Bang through Postmates, too, if you need a burger but can't make it out to Elizabeth.",

Inside, a menu and order counter greets you with specials and their classic burgers. The food took a little longer to come out than we may have initially anticipated (especially considering there were only 2 other people in the dining room). The burger itself was flavorful, but the french fries weren't much to write home about.

They were very reasonably priced for a counter service burger restaurant ($12-13 for double burger with fries), and the quality and flavors were amazing. I tried a double kimichi burger with a side of fries. I would highly recommend getting a double burger (1/2 lb.) because it's worth the little bit extra. The burger patties were extremely juicy and seasoned perfectly. The bacon fried kimchi was very flavorful and all of that wonderful kimchi flavor and bulgolgi sauce absorbed into the patty and made for a wonderful Korean inspired burger. The burger was garnished with some green onion and pickled cucumbers to cool your taste buds.   I was also impressed with the side of fries. They were a generous portion and came out super fresh. I love fresh, house made fries, and that is exactly what you get at Bang Bang Burger. The fries reminded me of Five Guys minus the grease. Overall, Bang Bang Burgers has delicious, great quality burgers and fries for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend trying them, and I will definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I am going to go ahead and start off by being blunt, then I'll try and soothe the wound. Bang Bang is extremely overrated and overpriced for what it is. I have given it multiple tries. It just is not the best burger and you leave wondering the following: 1) why you just paid an arm and a leg while you're 2) still hungry 3) not satisfied 4) questioning what the hype is.   I have had fries, a burger (prior to being vegan) and since being vegan have had the burger bowl with the black bean burger and no cheese. Portions are fairly small. The black bean burger is tasty enough but nothing unique.  The salad portion was small and toppings were not plentiful enough. But the lettuce was crisp and nothing was poor quality.   As for the environment itself, the staff members have always been friendly and it is always clean inside. I especially love the girl who always chats with me about her being vegetarian and me vegan. She was very easy going and accommodating when I had to make my order a little more complicated.   It is definitely not the worst place but I can see spending that amount on a meal elsewhere can benefit my hungry stomach and craving tastebuds more.",

    "text": "I found out about Bang Bang a little over 2 years ago because of their spectacular sliders and big win at the Moo and Brew festival. 2 years ago I said to The Lady, \"We should check that place out!\" It's taken me 2 freaking years to get over there. Why didn't anybody yell at me sooner? We had a group of 6, and on a Saturday night at about 7ish we were able to push 3 2-seaters together without inconveniencing anybody. I don't know if this is always the case, the place is relatively small. This was the type of menu that makes you look at one option say, \"That looks good\" and then another and say \"Oh, that looks good too!\" and another and just say \"Well $h!t.\" So I asked the girl at the register, and she suggested the Gangnam Style burger, and I opted to stick with the fries as my side because Yelp told me to.  All burgers are served on a wooden board that has a hole cut out for the burger cup, a really simple but nice presentation. All 6 of our orders came out in about 7 minutes, which was perfect.   Now, they have a warning on their menu, but the least they cook their burgers are medium. I'm a medium rare guy, always have been, but there's not really any arguing here. And frankly, you would never know the difference. These burgers are out of this world good. I especially loved the subtle spice in the Gangnam Style with the pork belly. I could eat this every day and never get tired of it. Their fries are also to die for; super crispy and well seasoned.   Honestly, this is probably my new favorite burger place in Charlotte. Can't wait to go back and try more of their creations.",

If you are a fan of burgers then you will soon be a fan of Bang Bang as soon as you visit!  Upon arriving you'll notice that as far as curb appeal goes they aren't trying too hard. They have their sign and a few small tables outside making it look like a typical small cafe. Inside is very calm and inviting. Their menu is super simple and they even have a flat screen previewing what your burger will look like. And the pictures are spot on unlike what you see in a pizza commercial and what you actually get.   You get your burger and fries (included) on a wooden plank and have ample places to choose to sit. The booths are super comfy and there is room for large groups at the tables. They have three TVs all unfortunately located on one wall so only half the restaurant can view them.   It's hard to choose which burger but all of them will leave you satisfied. And if choosing a burger isn't hard enough choosing one of their many sauces will be tough too! Don't forget to drink a local Charlotte beer while you're at it!",

Used to have a burger bowl that was the bomb, removed it from the menu. They charge about $13 for a burger, fries, and drink meal here and it's not worth it.

Entering inside found the line up to the counter was towards the right, but having missed it we thought a waiter would seat us inside. But it was a self order restaurant. The menu was small and easy which saves you the trouble of going to through pages of exotic food with hopes of getting back something close! My friends and I ordered a couple of TNT beef burgers and chicken sandwiches with sides. We took an empty table and our food came within a really short wait. The burgers were extremely tasty and juicy. The sides were not perfect- the French fries looked shabby and the onions rings thick with excess flour. Towards the end of our meal, we started taking smaller bites since everyone of us wanted to extend the relishing taste of the juicy burgers on our palate and rather take smaller bites than finishing early with empty plates.  Looking at the reviews we initially thought the place would be a fine dine restaurant but it was a modest place serving great delicious burgers! Definitely recommended for any foodie! Or Burgerie!",

    "text": "Right now, at this point in time, this might be one of my favorite burgers in Charlotte. I hesitate writing that as I live for burgers but this place really made an impression on me. To start, the lady that took my order was incredibly helpful, and that pleased me. I must have looked confused because she chimed in with some of her favorites, some great options, or letting me know that I can create my own. So, thats what I did.   I created and ordered a double, bacon, swiss, avocado, and mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. As I read on the menu, and what struck my fancy, is that the burger meat is from the \"highest quality, Black Angus whole muscle cuts of short rib & chuck, produced by NYC's own Pat La Frieda!\" I like that they are conscious of the meat they are using. I don't know if it's where the meat came from or what, but it was delicious. It was very very juicy and flavorful and I had a hard time putting it down and breathing during my bites. Also, I liked the toasted bun and the fries were so good, not soggy or cold and the perfect compliment.   The amount of food was more than decent and the presentation of the food was cute with the little cutting board and basket of fries. It also came with the 'bang bang' sauce, which I didn't use on my burger but did dip some of my fries in it and it was good but I wouldn't want to take away from the burger by using it too much or pouring it on top.   The other menu options look pretty tasty, I have to try the pork belly burger, and the other specialty burgers all look appetizing. I will say, food and service is a 5 for me but the place itself is probably a 4. It's on the smaller side and is an order upfront, get your drink, sit down and then they bring it to you, smashbruger, type set up - but smaller. When I've gone there were only a few people and still felt myself having to consciously maneuver around, so I could only imagine how it would be with just a few more people. If you like burgers, this is a place to go!!",

One or two perfectly cooked La Freida beef patties, delectable toppings depending on your choice of burger, and freshly baked buttery toasty bun. Melt in your mouth goodness. God, I want one again right now and it's 9am as I'm writing this.   My wife had the Bang Bang Burger and I had the TNT burger, both were fantastic. The burger came plated on a cutting board and accompanied with a single serving sized fryer basket of fries.   You order at the counter and they bring food out to your table, so you can save a little on tip compared to a full service restaurant.  Overall, a new favorite. We will be back.",

Also, there wasn't enough of the 'Asian\" topping - slaw, sauce and mayo - to really add any flavor to the already bland burger. That being said, the toppings were DELICIOUS and if there were more, I think it might bump the rating up a bit.  The fries were typical, nothing to write home about. To me, this burger was not worth $10 except maybe in size.  I would return ONLY if some friends or family wanted to come here just to be social.",

The Gangnam Style burger is my favorite - it is a Korean style pork belly with a cilantro onion slaw, soy vinaigrette and gochujang mayo. It's sweet, a little spicy, and sooo good! It doesn't feel heavy so I can eat it without feeling guilty (or super full). They also have build your own so that my fiance can eat his basic bacon chili cheeseburger. Their chips (with a light bbq seasoning) and fries are also delicious.",

The food was undoubtly tasty. I enjoyed my burger alot. The sweet potato fries were a little soft, but the dip was great. While I am a fan - the price point of this place is a little hard to swallow. Definitely a splurge for a burger. I can have 2 burgers at 5 Guys with this price and 5 Guys burgers are great.

    "text": "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I just ate the highest quality burger of my life at a place where you have to order at the counter and the burger only cost $9.  I was immediately impressed upon ordering at Bang Bang Burgers. I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints! I don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome.  The sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter.  Overall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.",
