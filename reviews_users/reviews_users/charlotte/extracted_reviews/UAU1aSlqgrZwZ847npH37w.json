Well Tavern on the Tracks has got your back. This bar is kind of a home away from home for the aforementioned areas. I really dig the decor of this place. It really screams: Look at me I am a great old school bar.   I stopped by to watch the NBA Finals game seven between the Lakers/Celtics. Just moving from Boston, I was rooting for the old home team. It was not meant to be as Lakers lead by their lead punk Kobe took out the Celtics as payback. This was a great spot to catch the game. The beers where cold and the food was pretty good. I really wanted the wings, which looked awesome, but decided to try the Steak in the Grass sandwich, basically steak with melted cheese and spinach on top. It was might tasty. The staff was top notch.  So if you are in the mood to catch the big game or cold one jump on the train and check out TT!",

    "text": "It's probably a safe bet that I've spent more money and more time at Tavern on the Tracks than any other bar or restaurant in Charlotte.  It used to be a once a week spot (at a minimum) for me.  My review may be slightly biased, as I now know the owners and I know several of the employees quite well due to the time spent there.    The thing that Tavern does the best is food.  They have, in my opinion, the best bar food in Charlotte.  Some bars do one or two things well, but Tavern's menu is varied and every item on that menu that I've eaten has been consistently good.  The food is the reason I go back.  The beer selection is just OK, but the food is where it's at.    If you've just moved from upstate NY and are joining the 3/4 of Charlotte's population that is also from upstate NY, then this is the bar for you.  You can watch the Bills, the Sabres, the Yankees and drink Labatt Blue to your heart's content.  You can find beef on weck and delicious stuffed banana peppers.    If you're a fan of the University of Michigan this is the place for you on Saturday afternoons during football season.  It is the home of Charlotte's chapter of U of M boosters.  There is a stuffed wolverine on display at Tavern to show their love of Big Blue.    There seems to be a pretty quick turnover of servers here.  The really good servers stay and become great bartenders or get the busy shifts on the weekends.  Service can sometimes be an issue here, but it's never so poor that I avoid eating here.  Menu highlights for me are the stuffed banana peppers, the fried ravioli, the meatball sub and the black bean burger on a pita.",

    "text": "Went there last night for the second time this month. The first time was fine, nothing to complain about there. Last night, however, literally gave me nightmares.  We got there around 9:00 and decided to sit at a high top table instead of the bar. There was one in the back corner by the door and a few arcade games. It was fairly crowded because trivia was going on, and we just sat there and played along for a few minutes, which was fine. After we'd been there for about ten minutes, we saw a huge black shiny thing moving on the wall. It took me a second to realize it, but what we had seen was a GIANT cockroach crawling up the wall not five feet from us. It was crawling in the other direction so, while we were a little creeped out, we kind of ignored it and kept talking/trivia-ing. Then my friend's eyes got big again and he was looking right past me, so I turned around and there was a second roach crawling on the wall behind me, but this time in our direction. We jumped up and walked over to the bar. The bartender asked us if anything was okay and we told her no, we had just seen a few (turns out there were others that I hadn't seen) cockroaches crawling around in the one corner. Instead of apologizing to us, she just said, \"that's not us. it's not our fault, I swear!\" and she kept making excuses as to why it had happened. I went home and cleaned my apartment from top to bottom. Needless to say, I will not be going back to this place.",

    "text": "Considering Tavern On the Tracks is just a hop, skip and crawl away from my house, it is indeed A-OK for me.   As the other reviewers said, the patio is pretty vast and a nice stop in the warmish months. This particular bar gets a ton of Panthers traffic before and after the game, which can be irritating if you just want to grab a sandwich on a Sunday night. But hey, they didn't invent football! That being said, the service can be spotty after a game considering the servers are doing their best to, um, cater to the drunkoids on the patio.   Besides the overall environment, though, I've had some pretty good eats and drinks here. The drinks are pretty standard - full bar and a multitude of brew options (mostly big brand beer here). I have been fairly impressed with their eats, though! The Toasted Ravioli is just smashing before or after you're smashed. This is important, folks - yes, it tastes good even if you're not drinking. I've also enjoyed the Turkey Pita and the delicious berry mayonnaise that accompanies it.   TOTT, a solid place to grab a bite, watch a game or just watch the hammered Panthers fan take down a bucket of beer and a messy burger. That's entertainment, for sure!",

Slow service AT FIRST, but once the waitstaff settled on which waitress was going to take care of us--wonderful!  I went with a group of 6. Everyone got something different. I tried the 1/2 beef on weck with 6 wings (of course I'm going to get the wings). The 1/2 beef was surely a full size--it was huge! Delicious beef on a toasty bun with au jus.  The wings--the wings were melt-in-your-mouth awesome. I tried the Caribbean flavor, and I instantly felt like I could hear the waves on the beach and steel drums playing. Yeah, that good! (not breaded but flash fried).  The beer specials were great, $2 miller lites which everyone drank.   Great for groups, to catch a game (lots of tvs), etc.",

I was not disappointed. The bar quickly filled to standing room only with more than 75% of the patrons donning some sort of Buffalo Bills paraphernalia. All 20 some TVs was showing the Bills game......to say the least, I felt at home. I had their Beef-on-weck, a single order of their wings prepared with the Gold Rush sauce and a side order of fries. The beef-on-weck was good, as well as the wings, but in my opinion, still not at the level of Buffalo. I will say though that being here for the game definitely made me feel as if I was sitting in the Rockpile in Ralph Wilson Stadium.",

Server gave us our check early and as soon as we paid they shut the lights off and would not turn them back on while we finished eating, music off also. So then the mgr comes out and ask us to leave at 2:10a, even though he sees us still drinking. Then he makes faces and noises as a child would. Then he locks the door and gawks out the door window for the next ten minutes. I will never recommend this place, contacting corporate and never returning again. It was my first time and my last!",

    "text": "So a graduate from UB moves next door to a Buffalo bar- some call it fate...   I have been to Tavern on the Tracks a mere three times and had vastly different experiences.  1st- The Sabres were playing and I needed wings ...oh and Blue Light. The bar was crowded and filled with Buffalo transplants. The cheers were obnoxiously wonderful- kind of like you were back home in HSBC arena. The wings were Duffs inspired. Crispy check. Franks Red Hot Sauce based check. Overall I felt for an instant I was 10 hours away.   2nd - The second experience was unlike the first although great none-the-less. I enjoyed literally one of the best Bloody Mary's I have ever had on the patio with my friend. It was a beautiful sunny day and the patio was filled with a fun younger crowd. If you're in need of a Sunday afternoon Bloody Mary you can't get much better than this!   3rd- One would think the third time would be a charm but not in this case. All started off well - I ordered one of those delicious Bloody Mary's (granted it was more of an end of the evening drink-but I couldn't resist) and again, it was delicious. My friend ordered a glass of wine. Her wine was corked - and while they did offer to open a new bottle she decided to give up and focus on food. She ordered a mini veggie pizza (TOT is not the best place for a vegetarian)... and my other friend asked the waiter how large the portion of calamari was (to which he responded we had more than enough food for three people)- so she ordered that. The food took forever- but it was late night so we patiently waited knowing that maybe the fryers took awhile to heat or what not.   Granted Buffalo pizza in my opinion, is not very good - my friends pizza was much much worse. I have tasted better things out of the freezer. The dough itself was scarily white -looking almost uncooked. The veggies were not cooked- just overall the pizza was a mess. The calamari was in a word-scary. The portion was super small - when we asked the waiter about this he snootily said \" well Ive had plenty of women eat it as their meal\"...I mean my friends and I are not behemoth ...and since one is a vegetarian it was only two of us eating it anyway- I just thought it was a very rude comment. The calamari are kept whole- meaning you are eating a tiny little fried creature with a body and tentacles ...it was a little much for me.  The sauce was an Asian sauce that was way too sweet so if you do order the calamari ask for marinara -as it was much better with that.   Overall I am going to call the third experience a fluke- and keep going back for wings- and Bloody Marys.",

Can't vouch for what they thought of the food but for me, I thought it was alright...nothing memorable/special.

    "text": "My husband and I visited the tavern a week ago for their Monday Wing Night special. We were promptly greeted and sat outside on the patio. However, when given the menus, the waiter failed to tell us that they were already out of wings at 6pm. This would have been great to know prior to looking through the menu. Nonetheless, we ordered and I should have known that my food was going to be wrong when the waiter didn't write anything down. We ordered the chicken tenders meal tossed in wing sauce. However, we received the wrong flavors and a side that was picked for us (we didn't know it came with an extra side besides fries and the waiter decided we would get coleslaw - we later asked for it to be changed). Upon telling the waiter that I received the wrong flavor, he attempted to remove all of the food from the table, including my husbands food who had already started to eat and was okay with his wrong flavor. We refused and the waiter said he would go get the manager. The \"manager\" arrived (and I say \"manager\" because he was actually the cook) to figure out how to fix our problem. The cook brought out the right flavor of tenders for me however, there was a very long piece of hair cooked into the breading of the tender. The real manager then arrived at my table and offered to cook me more tenders and assured me that I would receive a discount. At that point I no longer wanted any food- only the check. I received the staff discount which was about 50% off and signed off on the receipt. Now to my surprise, I check my back account they actually charged me the full amount. This visit which included no wings, poor service, miniature tenders, hair in my food and being overcharged is completely unacceptable.",

Hundreds of people were going in and out from 6-8 for a few minutes each to pick up a tshirt. In the SEVEN MINUTES I was parked in Tavern On The Tracks parking lot they put a boot on my car. They knew this event was going on and instead of sharing their 50 space parking lot for 2 hours on a Wednesday night when no one would be at their restaurant they decided to make a quick buck booting people. I go there often and will not be going again. You just got $120 from me to get the boot removed but you could have had much more if you continued to have mine and my friends business. Shame on y'all.",

She called the towing company and said they would waive the fee when we picked it up in the morning (she was super understanding about the incident). The towing company refused to release the car without payment and said nobody had the authority to make the agreement to waive payment. I called Tavern and spoke with Dre, their dedicated person to handle towing incidents (because they need one), and he essentially told me I was stupid for not reading their signs and even though I was a patron and bought several beers and some tequila at their establishment it didn't matter since I went to another bar down the the street during the night. I told him that they were providing a horrible customer experience and I didn't understand how they could do this to paying customers (I had receipt of our purchases). His response was that he didn't care about my business or if I ever came back. I understand that they want paying customers parking in their lot, but punishing these same customers if they go anywhere else is ridiculous and their customer service is horrendous. Who tells a customer they don't want their business? I will never go back, but I guess that's what Dre wants.",

It's like they used two whole breasts of chicken and cut them in half to make 4 tenders. Also, my (non-vegetarian) friends swear by the black bean burger.  And you get the great service you'd expect at a bar.  Fast drinks, servers are attentive, and there are plenty of tvs that they're willing to change to whatever sports u wanna watch.  One of my favorite bars in south end.. I almost hesitate to post such a good review cuz I don't want it to get overly crowded   I'm sure the other food is good, but I can't help but order the chicken tenders every time I come here because they're that.

They get a lot of complaints on their parking but there are several easy to read signs that clearly say their lot is for their patrons only, and I've never had a problem. The absolute best chicken tenders I've ever had. Authentic blue cheese and Buffalo style food. Their drink specials are always pretty good. I pretty much love their entire menu. Besides the chicken tenders, my favorite items have to be their Tavern quesadilla, all of their sandwiches and their brunch is always good. Service is good, some servers are better than others. Always have a great time here, especially during football season. It's a must for all upstate New Yorkers if you haven't been yet!! It does get very crowded on Sundays though so if you're planning to watch the game, come early.",

    "text": "This business is drowning and now I know why. Instead of making every effort to improve the quality of their business they rather make a business out of their private lot. Sad? Yes, to the extreme. If your car gets towed, don't bother asking the towing company for info about their towing business because they'll give you a nasty attitude for simply asking questions. Why the nasty attitude? Because the more questions you ask, the longer it will take them to tow your car which slows the business down when they could be towing more cars for more money. Also, don't bother googling the phone number and address from the towing sign because the information is fake. They don't have a True cost on the towing fees. It will all depend on your attitude and interaction with them. For me, it was going to be $225 cash to remove the boot from my car. If I use debit/credit then it's an additional 20% added which would make $270. For that price, I could get good seats to a Panthers game or an Apple Watch. Good thing I wasn't dumb enough to withdraw cash for them. They tried to charge my debit card but, because I have a good relationship with my bank, I was able to dispute it. The whole process took about a week to resolve. Do everything possible before giving up your hard-earned money to this sham. I understand the owner has the right to protect his property but if I'm a paying customer then I shouldn't have to go through that, ever.",

I call the number and reach a very rude and shady \"manager\" who keeps repeating the phrase \"$350 cash, \"420 card\" over and over again and not listening to any questions I ask. I have a friend bring me to the lot to get my car. The lot attendant was a nice man and he made the unpleasant situation bearable. Ran into a couple that also got towed, who also went to TOT and bar hopped, and had a receipt to prove it. They said they had tried to speak with the TOT manager and was given some attitude and really shady answers. Seems like the tavern is in bed with this towing company. I mean, if you tow over 15 cars a night at $350 minimum, you're definitely making money off this scam.

They towed my car and when I apologized and told them I honestly hadn't realized I couldn't park there unless i was EXCLUSIVELY going to Tavern On The Tracks he showed me the sign and physically had to unfold it before it was readable. Once we got to the towing lot in the sketchiest part of Charlotte they wouldn't let my friend walk back to get my car with me. He told me that only the person who the car was registered to could walk back in their dark, sketchy parking lot. Then he threatened to call the police on us! These guys are disgusting, pathetic, sorry excuses for human beings. They sit in the lot and watch you walk into bars but they don't warn you or make sure you understand what those parking spaces are for. Tavern either needs to charge for the damn lot or ask people where they are going first (like they do at the other lot around the corner for AAP, slate, and all those places). Absolutely disgusting scam and $350 to get your car back. I will literally never go there again. Completely ridiculous.",

We ordered the Tracks Quesadilla and the wings (I believe it was Gold Rush flavor). The quesadilla was delish......pulled pork inside with a side of ranch for dipping. So good! Didn't eat the wings because by the time I looked over, my husband had eaten all of them already! Guess they were good!   Great place for bar food, sports, and good drinks!

We probably sat at the table for five minutes until our server brought us waters and then about five mins later asked us for our beer orders. Drinks probably took a total of 10 mins.. decided to order nachos. After the order was placed the server then told me that they were out of the cheese for the nachos so she suggested queso instead. I decided to try the queso on the nachos since it's all they had. It was decent not bad the nacho portion was very small ( I also work in the service industry and at my job our nachos are 9.99$ and you get wayyyy more). All in all, the nachos were just ehh. Had ordered another beer took about 10 mins for her to finally bring the beer over. When she brought me the bill there was a 3$ queso charge... FIRST OF ALL...I should not have been charged for the cheese when they had nothing else to go on the nachos so no. The server didn't apologize nor did she tell me that the queso would've been extra since they were out of shredded cheese that came with the nachos. So will not be coming back. The atmosphere is eh and the service is poor considering they weren't busy in comparisons to other uptown restaurants.",

Myself and my boyfriend came here with my sister and her girlfriend last night for pride weekend and witnessed one of the most homophobic acts I've ever seen. We came here because it was the only place in the area that didn't have a line around the corner... which in hind sight should have been the first sign. We were all sitting at the bar and noticed a staircase that looked like it led up to a rooftop (which isn't unusual in this area as most of these bars have a rooftop). My sisters girlfriend said she'd go check it out to see if it was crowded before we all moved from our spots at the bar. She wasn't but halfway up the stairs when a man that was drunk out of his mind YANKED her by the crotch and told her to \"get the fuck out you dyke.\" It was so aggressive that she almost fell down the stairs. When we all rushed over to see who this man was, turns out he's the OWNER! I literally thought we were being punked. I guess the upstairs area was closed but there was NO sign or rope telling you not to go up there. When we returned to our seats at the bar to obviously close our tabs, a few of the bartenders said this kind of thing happens all the time with the owner and offered her a free drink.... WHAT??!!!

We arrived at 7:00 and asked for a table to get a quick bite before our show at Amo's.  We were told there was a wait because the kitchen was backed up. We should have left and tried another venue but stayed and took our chances.  The hostess ended up scratching us off the list because she said \"she couldn't find us\" but once we got that straight we were seated and ordered our food.  Two of us did not order, the other two ordered the Steak Salad.    Soon as we ordered the music went off and the basketball game came on.  Cool, I thought, we get to watch a great rivalry game.  But did the volume have to be on 11??  We could not hear each other and could not have any kind of conversation.  We sat there staring at the screen and each other unable to communicate.  Our food arrived about an hour after we ordered and the Steak Salads were of really good quality, so I felt it was worth the wait but with all the other issuse that night, it may be a while before I go back.

They hired a towing company that literally stalks the moves of any patron parking there and if you don't immediately go into the restaurant or immediately go straight to your car after leaving they will tow you. I was there for almost one hour and went to one bar for quick drink after leaving tavern and my car was towed. There was a lady in the lot that worked for the towing company saying she \"saw me\" not go directly into the restaurant because I was finding where my friends were parking. The fact any restaurant condones this behavior or treatment for their patrons is beyond ridiculous. Screw this place. Screw the owner. And screw the towing company. I don't normally use yelp because I know it ruins restaurants but I couldn't care less if this restaurant failed. I want my $300 back.",

I suggested we should go up by Tavern on the Tracks, which is an upstate NY staple that reminds me of home and the warm feeling you get of being at a pub.  The problem is my friends who are also from upstate NY were at Riverbank or whatever the name is of the new bar, so I parked at Tavern with the expectations of heading over to the Tavern  after I met up with them not knowing that there would be people looking to tow with the intentions of extorting 350 dollars out of me.  WAIT I OWE 350, FOR WHAT?  My car was towed for parking in an establishment that I have come to for years to watch Bills games that I felt like at home to find out that really I was being screwed.  The day before Thanksgiving my sons car seat was locked in a garage in some shit neighborhood because I parked in a stupid gravel pit and I didn't buy a stupid beer from you.  I wouldn't mind if it was a $100 for the tow, but 350.  Thanks for ruining my holidays with your extortion.  I will never support tavern on the track ever again as they have fell to the greed of the world.",

    "text": "Worst experiences here. Not only does their service absolutely suck and their food not worth anything, they are also overpriced and have a super sketchy parking service going on. I parked in the lot and was planning to bar hop but had to walk to helles and dunkel down the block to bring someone their keys first. I was back in less than 20 minutes and was booted.    The guy that was doing it had been sitting in a car in the lot watching people with his shoes off and sticking his feet out the window (his name was Anthony). As I'm trying to discuss how to get this boot off my car, the guy actually there doing the toeing comes over and interrupts me to talk to the guy about getting beers for them! Both of them are working and one in towing cars, but both driving and working, and they are drinking! Unprofessional and untrustworthy. The guy told me it was 120 cash or 144 with a card. I never once said I wouldn't pay, but that is ridiculous! I had to call my friend to come help me pay for it as I didn't have the money on my cards. However, after bugging him cause I was veryyy broke, he had told me I could split it between cards. I still didn't have enough that way so called my friend. My friend came over and got a little sassy, but he was being rude to her so it was justified. He didn't like her being sassy and when she said \"Bullshit\" about something he said, he then said \"Just for that, you can't pay by card anymore, only cash!\" And after saying that and being called out on it, started lying saying that his card reader wasn't working. Mind you, I had been next to him the whole time and without ever picking up anything the whole time, he magically managed to go from being able to take two cards to not having a working card reader. Liar!!! Then he kept saying that because the card wasn't in the name of the owner of the vehicle, that he couldn't take it! I repeatedly asked him to show me written proof of that law and to prove his card reader was broken and he refused.     She went and got the manager at Tavern on the tracks and the tow guy wouldn't stop fighting with me and wouldn't let me pay and threatened to have me towed then and there. He continued to lie and be disrespectful and untrustworthy. Once the manager came out, the guy lied and said he didn't say anything like it and that his card reader wasn't even with him but the guy with the truck had one. Eventually, my friend just went and got cash and I got the hell out of there. But I can tell you what, I along with all organizations and charity groups I'm involved with, will not be giving this place business ever again.",

In need of some libations, we all ordered beer, however, when they came out they were all slightly above optimum temperature and lacked carbonation. Think something may be off with their tap system.   Incredibly ravenous, we started with the salsa and guacamole. The salsa was fine, if you like Pace picante, but the guacamole was basically inedible. It tasted fishy and I am still a bit unsure why.   I ordered the black bean burger with a side salad. Yes, I know this doesn't set me up for success, but I was assured it was housemade, like everything else at this place, which is highly commendable. The actual burger was OK and the execution was kinda strange (it came on a pita). Side salad was meh.  The husband's fish and chips were absolutely delicious though! Everything was perfectly fried and tasted wonderful. Would definitely recommend ordering if you find yourself here.  Friends at the table also enjoyed the chicken wings and French dip. The waitress was nice enough to let us sample the wing sauces (our pal swears by the wings, but we don't eat meat, so we were intrigued). All the sauces were very good and again, housemade.  Understand my experience would have probably been better if I had gotten something fried, but if it isn't good, don't put it on the menu!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of TOT - its a simple no-frills bar that serves up some amazing food. When I lived in South End a few years ago my wife and I would walk here regularly as they always had decent beer specials and it was one of the few places open late for food. That still holds True today as my wife and I popped on on Wednesday night to catch the end of the Panther's pre-season game. I like that they always have Red Oak on draft as it is my wife's favorite beer, and they hold True to their northern roots by having some other beers on draft (like Lebatt) that you normally don't see in this area. For food, I always recommend the wings (gold rush is amazing) and the quesadilla (odd - i know, but it is really good!). Pro tip - if you order a bunch of wings to go, let them sit in your oven at 200F for a few hours and they will become fall off the bone tender. Just learned that last night. Anyways, my only gripe about TOT is what makes it great. It is a Buffalo Bills / Michigan bar which means they don't pull for my home teams and they can get crazy on game day. However, when we had the 'snowpocalypse' in 2015 and everything else shut down, they laughed and remained open - good for us because we could walk there at the time! While the bar scene in that particular area has become very competitive, don't hesitate to pop into TOT for a more relaxed and enjoyable experience.",

Right next to Amos', you can come grab a late night drink and snack after a show, and next to Gin Mill, so you can grab some food before/after drinking. Perfect.   It's a nice place to just chill with a few friends over a couple beers while watching some sort of sports game, or to plan some marvelous activity. Definitely a more toned down place, so a good place for a moment of recollection during a bar crawl. Bartender is nice. Drinks are cheap. Food is good for bar food and cheap. Atmosphere laid back. Park on the corner of Bland/S Tryon and the entrance is through the parking lot.   For future reference: Only a block from the Bland light rail stop, good stumbling distance.",

Occasionally we have stopped in for a Sunday game but it's a very one team kind of place.  Last night, the eve of the 4th, we had been uptown walking around, we took a cab home and asked to be dropped off here to grab a quick bite. The bartender took a very long time to get around to us, the room was fairly empty, and she seemed shocked that we wanted to order anything? We didn't really understand her suprise.  The quality of food was soooo bad, we left most of it on the plate. A hint to any server, if a customer leaves most of their meal behind, ask them if the food was ok or if you can do anything else for them.  We left, feeling very eh about both the server and the food. What a shame.",

I had a cup of chili (since it was cold) and some of the hand breaded chicken fingers in garlic hot sauce.  REALLY good!  Originally I was going to order my two picks separately, but the waiter advised me to get the combo which was cheaper and came with fries.  I always believe it's a good sign when people are trying to help you save money or get more bang for your buck [within reason]... I know at movie theaters they try to sell you more popcorn for a smaller amount $, but it's already high to start with!  No dice!  Back to Tavern.

The 'Steak in the Grass' filet sandwich with sauteed spinach is to die for. My friend also got a serious fried bologna sandwich. It was as thick as a hamburger, no joke.

They have some Buffalo Classics like Beef and weck and fried bologna sandwich.  I have to say, I was disappointed by their \"buffalo wings\".  They were severely lacking in sauce and they were very mild in spice.  The meatball sub was very tasty though...redeemed.    Advice to other fans:  This is a Bills bar.

The old school feel of this place reminds me of my northern roots (and with good reason since it is a Buffalo and Michigan bar). Despite the staple of Labatt's always being on special here (I believe), the French Dip with fries is the reason I end up here. A good quality shaved beef on a long roll with melted cheese and the perfect amount of au jus. The fries have the perfect amount of skin left on them. I have had a lot of inconsistency with service unless I sit at the bar which I recommend if you go in solo. However if you are going there to watch a game none of the bar seating really has a good view of a TV without twisting around. I do occasionally bike here and a bike rack under the deck would be appreciated. I also met a client here for lunch once and if memory serves, I was asked to use the neighboring bar's wifi (this may have changed).",

    "text": "I guess this review is 2 sided.  One side for the food (great!)  The other side for the actual bar (Meh.)  Food- The food is really tasty and pretty cheap.  Please order anything with blue cheese, it will change your life it is so delicious.  Chicken fingers are awesome too.  Burger is good, fries are good, bloody mary (though not a real food) is great too.  My only gripe is that they have Beef on Weck which is a total Buffalo thing but the roll the \"Weck\" wasn't right.  The whole point of the sandwich is to have a roll with rock salt and caraway seeds, this had neither.  Fail.   Bar- As a sports bar they need better tv's to watch said sports. It's a Buffalo/Michigan (NOT Michigan State) bar which is an interesting combo.   I went to college in Buffalo so it has a little piece of my heart regardless.  My husband went to Michigan State and got the evil eye on Michigan vs. Michigan State game day when we wore his MSU shirt.  I mostly go here because it is at the end of my street and laziness almost always prevails.  They have tables and tv's outside which is fun for an afternoon of game watching and drinking!",

We sat out there for about 10-15 minutes and no one had come to take our orders. So two friends went inside to get drinks from the bar. About a minute after they went inside a waiter came over and didn't introduce himself or anything just asked for our order. So I told him oh I'm sorry but our friends went inside to order. He got really upset going on about how they can't have people just going back and forth as they please. I said I'm sorry but they just walked in and described them to him. He went to look for them, comes back out really mad and says well I can't find them what do you want. At this point my patience was wearing thin but as it was my Birthday I really didn't want to spoil the evening. I calmly said oh I'm sorry they were ordering for us as well since we waited so long and no one came out. He stormed off in a huff. Needless to say no one ever came by our table again. I personally have never been to this particular bar before and to be honest I'm not likely to choose this place again. I understand people have bad days and it was pretty late but the reality is other bars were far more courteous that night and I'm more likely to frequent them instead. Besides the drinks were only okay...",

    "text": "Im an Ohio state fan so it's like stabbing my eyes out walking into this place on Michigan game day ( this is the Michigan and Buffalo Bills bar), but Tavern is one of my favorite bars in Charlotte. It's older, but has its charm. They have a nice sized patio and Lots of TVs. I've came here a couple of times and have nothing, but good things to say.   Here's the breakdown:  Drinks- they always have drink specials and on the weekends they offer $2 mimosas. Plus, they don't overprice their drinks.   Food- Yum! Everything I've had here has been amazing! I love the salmon BLT wrap- they load it up!!! The Buffalo chicken wrap is a staple item- can't go wrong with it and their wings are also tasty!! I recommend the goldrush sauce. All in all the food isn't gourmet by any means, but for bar food it's pretty good. Nothing fancy here.   Service- like I said, I'm an OSU fan, so if they can deal with me since Michigan fans want to kill me then this bar rocks!   Go bucks!",

Fantastic homemade mix. It's served in a tall, carafe... complete with celery, olive and pepperoncini garnish.   Pretty decent bar food here. This may sound odd, but one of my favorite things on the menu is the stuffed banana peppers. Garlic, bleu cheese, parmesan in a bread crumb mix melted provolone served with bread and balsamic glaze. I also like the steak in the grass. TOT does brunch on Saturdays and Sundays... including an omelet you can make your own way.  Dog friendly patio complete with TVs.

We walked in and sat at the bar, there were 5 male customers at the bar sitting around us and it was around 4pm. There was only 2 female bartenders working - both brunette and the bar itself had a few tables with customers but nothing too crazy. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes - the bartenders never acknowledged us for 10 whole minutes. One time one of the girls even got right in front of us to grab beer but she didn't look up. After about 5 minutes since we been there about 5 feet away the bartender sits on the ledge to talk to a male customer and didn't even look to her left to try to help us. Finally after 10 minutes of obviously ignoring us she walks over puts two napkins down and say hi how are you what can I get you? So we ordered a beer and a drink and she asked if we wanted to keep it open or close out so we said close out. She left the tab in front of us and didn't check on us again for another 15 minutes. We had put the credit card down as soon as she put the tab down because like we said, we wanted to close out. We had to wave one of the bartenders down to tell her to run the card she walked past us and ignored us and we had to wave the other bartender down to ask her to run the card. After she did - we closed Out, and we are never going back again. Customer service is everything - please improve your bartenders customer service skills.",

If you want good entertainment on a Friday or Saturday night, come out to watch the people who are unable to read the (parking for Tavern customers only) signs that are posted all over the place get towed or booted.

They had quite a few drink specials going on and lots of people were getting beer towers.  We stuck to some local craft beers.  I ordered the Tracks Quesadilla, which was stuffed with pulled pork and jalapenos.  It was surprisingly delicious, and super filling!  I also tried the Toasted Ravioli, which were essentially just mozzarella sticks shaped like raviolis, but they were good as well!  For a low key spot to catch up with friends or watch a game, I would definitely recommend Tavern On The Tracks!  Ask about their drink specials- they always have some good deals going on.",

They do have an outside deck that is nice, but the food and service is so so.  I feel like this place just hires young girls that don't know what they are doing to work the restaurant.  The problem with that is it attracts your frat boy crowd and the service kinda sucks.  My last meal I had there was the wings.  They cost $16 for 12 and there was nothing \"jumbo\" about them.",

So be aware on Sundays in football season. You can expect this place to be crowded due to its location. Right off the Blue Line and right behind All American and Hot Taco.   Nothing really to brag about. I do enjoy getting the nachos. Their wings are okay too. Nothing special but it will fill you up. It has a nice patio with plenty of tvs. The bathrooms are small and most of the time not that clean. But this place isn't claiming to be some fancy hip new restaurant. Tavern has been here for awhile and has stayed the same.   I haven't had an issue with service. It's never been phenomenal but I don't really expect that walking in. Read some reviews and make your mind up. If you decide Taverns not for you then there are plenty of other places to look too.",

I've been here three times now for food and football games, and each time has left me with a positive experience. Despite being crowded during games, they wait staff is always fast and friendly. I don't think I've ever waited more than 15 minutes for food here, despite ordering at halftime during a packed gameday crowd.  The loaded fries are a great snack to split. The wings are pretty good size, and are super tender. I'd recommend the gold rush sauce, it's dyn-o-miteeeeee. Another great option is the Salmon BLT wrap (my wives favorite); it's loaded with salmon, and cooked to your liking. If none of this piqued your interest, then I'd recommend the good ole chicken tenders and fries. They're huge tenders, and hand breaded .. not the cheating kind that comes frozen in a bag.   PS: This is a Wolverines (Go Blue) and a Buffalo backers bar!",

After seeing the Towing Racket they have orchestrated first hand makes me resent ever supporting their establishment. I parked in their lot because I was meeting a party of friends for dinner. Once parked, my colleagues called to let me know they were in the area at Hot Taco and to stop by for a quick shot before joining my party for dinner. I was literally at Hot Taco for 15 minutes when my party at \"Tavern On The Tracks\" called and angrily stated they just towed my vehicle. In disbelief I briskly walked to the restaurant  to see the tow truck pulling off with my car, while trying to understand how that happened so quick when I've always patronized their establishment and considering I work and live in the downtown area; but to take notice of another tow from the same company towing a guys car who parked there after me. The tow driver then stopped at the steps of the entrance of the restaurant and handed the round Latin bouncer some cash, from there I knew it was a set up. As a community we have to look out for one another but we also shouldn't support Businesses who deliberately take advantage of those who pay their bills, regardless of the night. All my colleagues at Wells Fargo Securities and friends who live in the South End area will unify and ensure Tavern On The Tracks doesn't benefit from the growing economy of Charlotte. Bill Acquario the community will not stand for this and we are all well aware this is a regular occurrence. $300 paid for a debit transaction to release my vehicle smh",

When we showed up we asked if the kitchen was still open before we were seated and they told us yes. We sat outside, ordered food and a beer. The waitress offered us a bucket of beer instead and we told her ok. When the food came out the wings were not cooked we had to send them back this was around 130 when the waitress came back she told us they could not re grill them or make more because they had already closed the kitchen so they took it off the bill. Than the waitress told us we needed to go ahead and pay so they could close the registers. After she brought the bill back they turned off the outside lights so we were left in the dark to finish our dinner and drinks. We asked a waitress if the could turn the lights back on and she said she would have to see and rolled her eyes. At 145 the manager came to the door and told us we needed to leave. We told him we still had a bucket of beer to finish that his staff sold us. We told him it was rude that he turned off the lights after we paid and he just said WOW! and walked away. He came back to the door every 5 mins and stared at us until we left at 2:00 which is when most bars downtown close. Even the Gin Mill next door still had a packed house. We will never eat hear again. Most unprofessional staff I have ever seen. The food sucked too. STAY AWAY!!!",

This bar is definitely not trendy.  Personally, I like it that way.  The food is good, the drinks are cheap, and if you live in the South End area, you can't beat the location.  Carissa is really the only bartender that's any good though.  She's the type that already has your next drink waiting for you before you've finished the one you're on.  The others are slow and kind of standoffish.  If you want a bar just to go, watch a game, grab some food, and just relax, this is a great bar to go to.  It never gets super crowded outside of the Buffalo sport nights and everyone there makes you feel right at home.  I would avoid the bar like the plague whenever teams from Buffalo are playing (unless you're a Buffalo fan), those people are obnoxious!",

They use waffle fries with just the right amount of cheese and plenty of bacon.  The ranch dressing for dipping simply added to its taste.  So good we ordered two!  The chicken wings are very good as well.    This is a restaurant in Uptown that has that local \"hometown bar feel -  a square wrap-around bar is the focus of the restaurant.  They have a full bar.  You can tell they had their regular customers as you saw laughter and camaraderie amongst the bar patrons.  Plenty of televisions to watch whatever you wanted.   There was also a few electronic games to play.  The service was excellent.  It seems as though its the same staff that has been there for years.  So friendly and helpful.

First off, we were stopped by a drunk guy at the entrance wanting to play \"rock, paper, scissors \".   So, we walk in and incredibly loud rap music was blaring with a lot of swearing.  I'm no prude but he, it's supposed to be a nice comfortable restaurant, not a college bar.    We were sat only to see 4 or 5 guys SLAMMING a boxing machine the entire time we were there.  Ok, now onto the food.  Took waitress recommendation for a Beef on Weck Sandwich (same as a French dip but on a bun, not hoagie roll).  Fatty roast beef, just gross.    Had buffalo chips as an appetizer.  They were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Out of Miller light on tap and bud light, seriously, both?    Fresh cut fries.....ummmmm, refried several times, gross.  Didn't even seem fresh cut at all.  Seriously, everything about this place was a huge disappointment.   I had fish, and it was undercooked.  I asked for it well done specifically.  The waitress was nice, that's about all I can say good.",

What is really at issue is the corruption in how this place conducts its business. What kind of place steals customers' cars from the lot and then charges them $420 to get it back? They even did this to a mother of two and tore the bumper off her car, causing over $1000 in damage, only to be given the runaround for two weeks before the \"towing company\" would accept any responsibility.   My car was towed as well, even though I was in the restaurant the whole time! Fortunately, I successfully contested the charge on the credit card, which I recommend you do if this happens to you.   What is happening is that the owner has decided this is how he supplements his income, as \"Carolinas Towing LLC\" is giving him kickbacks under the table.

I was craving some wings and John H. said it was decent.   So: Some really good Nineties music + cute waitresses + really good wings made with house made sauce (the Gold Rush has just enough heat) + Legion's Juicy Jay + great company = fun night.  Go for the wings and beer - get down and dirty - and leave your car at home!!",

    "text": "Yes, it's a Bills bar. Yes, if you park in the lot and don't immediately go in the bar you will get towed. Just know that going in and you're totally fine. This place has the normal grungy bar scene, is understaffed & the food is average at best.   When we arrived it wasn't very crowded, yet it still took our waitress forever to get our drinks, then another forever to get our food orders, then another forever to actually get our food. Catch my drift? And I'm typically a very patient person. Before it got crowded, our waitress did nothing but complain about how busy they were and that there weren't enough of them working. No one complained to her face, she just offered up all of this as a fact and not even apologetic.   Anyways, the food-the menu looked great and the food was your average bar food. The buffalo blue chips are literally potato chips with hot sauce poured over it with some cheese and banana peppers on top. I was hoping it would've looked like a little more effort was put into it. The best thing out of what the table ordered was the French fries covered in cheese, bacon, and scallions. I also ordered the bbq chicken flatbread, and it was a disappointment. My husband burger was just okay (per him). At the end of the night, our friend paid with gift cards (WHICH HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE! WTH?!?!). It took the bartender or whoever a solid 20 minutes to figure out how to calculate it....  Basically, I would only come back if my friends forced me to.",

Their wings are among the best in Charlotte (try the gold rush sauce), and it was here I discovered my love for the Buffalo staple known as the beef on weck. Nothing fancy but they provide friendly service and some great bar food. Please note that on Sundays if the Bills are playing you better go somewhere else if you want to watch a different game. Every TV will be dedicated to the Buffalo Bills. Also they are known to be very strict when it comes to parking in their lot so do not park there and walk to a different bar or you will likely be towed.",

Well I decided to look on Groupon for some money saving food ideas...since it's the holidays and I'm sticking to a budget AND guess what pops up first??? This baby...15$ for $30 worth of food AND there wasn't any restrictions on using the voucher for alcohol purchases. WIN WIN AND WIN!!! But back to the food and atmosphere. It was great. A Saturday at 5pm and it was the reserved day for Halloween and we got to see plenty of costumes. The waitresses here was even dressed up. Looking at the reviews of this spot and everyone raves about the wings and the special sauces. Hands down this was the best wings that I have eaten at any bar place in a very very long time. They were hot and fresh and cooked just the way I love it. Our servers Tiffany, Tim and Jeff in that order-yes we had three of them because we decided to sit at the bar, were absolutely amazing and engaging, which I love especially when seated at the bar. There are multiple televisions here and they also have a gold interactive game. This is a spot that I am definitely coming back to and hate that I've waited forever to get here.",

I asked the employees, bartenders included, how they sleep at night to which they responded \"we don't\". Don't fund this place. It is disgusting and filled with unethical human beings.

But it's not a typical frozen patty so that's a win.  3. If you get a salad - order it with the warm bacon vinaigrette dressing.   4. Wednesday is trivia night.

Food was a little lackluster especially the specialty mac and cheese, which needed a little more flavor. Chicken wings had a good variety of flavors available, and had a good thigh/wing ratio. Unfortunately ours tasted a little undercooked, perhaps they just were taken out a bit early. The crust of the flatbread we ordered was a bit overcooked. Overall a solid standard food experience. Service was good, especially considering how busy they were!  P.S Nathan Peterman should never pick up a football ever again. Circle the wagon",

    "text": "I came here to check them out for Charlotte Burger Week.  I went during the mid afternoon so I didn't have any trouble finding parking.  I do see how on a busy night it would be extremely difficult to find a place to park or even a place to sit inside.  I wasn't sure where the entrance was so I just went inside through the patio.  Still not sure if that's the main entrance but it worked!  I was promptly seated at a table by the bar.  There are no chairs with backs here, only backless barstools.  It's not that big of a deal, but I like having a place to lean back especially if I'm going to kick back for drinks and a football game. There's not much to the inside.  It's just a basic bar but be aware that it is a Buffalo Bills bar.  If you aren't a fan of the bills then you probably aren't going to want to come to this bar during football season.  The waitress was also the bartender and was very attentive.  She kept my drink full and made sure my food order was good.  I will say that the burger they had for CBW was impressive.  It it was a half pound burger on a brioche bun with blue cheese crumbles, Frank's red hot, and onion straws. (Plus the basics of pickles, onion, tomato and lettuce.)  It was $6 for the special and I ordered a side of homemade chips with ranch dressing.  The burger was juicy and delicious. I couldn't even finish half of it because it was so filling.  I took home half to eat later!  The house made chips were cold.  There were crispy but I would have preferred if they had come out hot or at least warm.  Considering I was the only person in the place eating, I don't think it should have taken 25 minutes to get my food.  Their ranch dressing was nice and creamy but they charged 75 cents for it.  I get it.  You have to cover your costs but at least tell me when I order it that it's going to cost extra.  Overall, the food was decent but I wasn't super impressed and  I'm not sure if I'll be back.  The patio did look really nice for drinks and I might have to come check that out with some of their famous bloody mary's I've been reading about on the Yelp.",

It was trivia night while we were there & the questions were really difficult to hear outside, so my mom & I decided not to play.  Anyways, the food here was a little better than I expected. I was thinking sports bar food just from the look of the place, but they actually have a pretty good menu with plenty of intriguing options. The food is above average, & you'll pay a pretty decent price, but it's well worth it on the patio.  I didn't know what to expect from Tavern On The Tracks at first; I mainly thought sports bar with average food. But I was surprised at how good the food was & how nice the patio atmosphere was. I can't speak to what the inside is like, but patio seating is a nice relaxing atmosphere to enjoy on a nice night.",

We each had a local NC beer here, which were both tasty and inexpensive at $4 a pint.  Our server was very nice, and not pushy when she found out we weren't there to eat dinner, but were just having a drink and enjoying the lovely weather.

He sent the burger back and they took the 2 halves and put them on the grill, which burnt both open sides of the burger, but still didn't cook the meat through. There is no way that this should be an acceptable \"fix\" for something that is undercooked. Our waitress even told us that the cooks are not good here and she has issues with them daily. Management should be aware of this and those people should not have a job. There are enough people looking for jobs that would be willing to put forth the effort needed in this type of position.

One of my friends who had ordered the same thing was regularly chugging down water and we both ended up not finishing (saltiness becomes unbearable when you're no longer starving).

    "text": "Stick to the basics. Don't be an idiot. The same way you don't wander into shady neighborhoods when you're away from home, don't order something you would get at a fancier place when you're at a sports bar. That being said, Tavern on the Tracks serves hearty and great versions of pub food classics. The trick to this is little fan fare (no pun intended), fresh ingredients and meals are prepared to order. All of your simple Gordon Ramsay stuff. The portions are generous and traditional, the way they should be at a sports bar.  Cheap beer. Cheap beer that is not Bud, Bud Light or PBR. Which means cheap beer that doesn't taste like used beer or give you a splitting headache and the runs. Tavern runs $3 beer specials on all pints pretty regularly, althought I'm not certaiin which days. This is a pretty large place inside, so if it's not game day or big minor league basketball game, there is no real issue with seating. As mentioned by others, this is definitely a Buffalo Bills bar which means I stay very far away on Sundays, since I'm a Pats fan and don't want to catch LOSER-itis. J/K! I could only wish there was a place this great as a home base for watching a Sunday game.  Very important, the atmosphere and people in here are decidedly WAAAYYY less douchey than at some of the other places in this neighborhood. You don't need a silver-plated spoon to ride this train. This is a very laid back bar and has a Northern feel to it.    Keep it simple and that's what the Tavern does. The buffalo tenders and wings here are some of the spiciest I've had in Charlotte. Anyone who says otherwise, did not get the \"steam-engine\" flavor. Even drunk, finishing all these will be difficult. For any pub, wings are the equivalent of filet for a steakhouse. The fish and chips is another fried greasy hangover comfort remedy that is a can't miss here. I've tried a few of the sandwiches and while not mind-blasting, they are satisfying. This restaurant serves fresh cut fries that are pretty average. While I always go for fresh anything, these fries are pretty limp most of the time. This is the one area that needs improvement. I cannot speak as to the quality of the hamburgers (a True pub food staple) as I rarely get them anymore. Being informed is a great way to ruin your fun. I've heard mixed reviews.  I'm not saying that if you order something other than wings or beef on weck, it won't be good, but don't be surprised if the pasta you order is not as great as your favorite Italian joint. In comparison, humble pub food AT A PUB will be the best tasting food to eat of all options. (This service announcement isn't just for this particular restaurant...its a general common sense thing, like put cold stuff in refrigerator). Not sure why I'm so ornery about this today.  I don't get the fascination people have with sitting outside on the patio to eat. Most of them don't even smoke. That also being said, the patio is nice and if I had friends, I might understand sitting out on a nice day to have a meal. However, the television sets out there look like something my Dad brought home in 1983.",

    "text": "Tavern on the Tracks is another good place for WNY transplants.  I don't frequent it nearly as much as I did when I lived closer.  One of the former co-owners opened a similarly themed restaurant in Fort Mill called Towne Tavern, but the menus have become more and more separated over the years since they aren't affiliated.  TOTT is a rare place for Charlotte.  It's much more of a blue collar bar than a lot of the places in the area that are more yuppyish.  The inside seems cavernous with high ceilings, a huge bar, a split level, and a big outdoor patio.  The building dates back to the early 1900s so it's rustic.  I used to see a lot of local celebrity athletes in there, but not so much anymore.    The food is mostly above par, but I think they may have expanded their menu a little too much and not everything is good.  The wings are extremely good, reminiscent of those found in WNY, but WNY's not as famous staple - the beef on weck sandwich - is not a True beef on weck.  The fish fry is inconsistent and the pizza, once served on Nirtsche's dough (a former nearby pizza place operated by WNY'ers) is now served on pre-made dough.   My wife ordered shrimp once and it smelled very foul.   There are some decent menu options though like steak in the grass.  This is normally a sandwich in WNY but the take on it here is that it is served as a filet with melted mozzarella and spinach and mashed potatoes on the side.  It's very good.  The pastas and apps have always been halfway decent too.  My recommendation is too check the Buffalo Bills and Sabres schedule and stay away when they're playing.  The parking can be very tight, so use the light rail if that's an option (that is why it's called Tavern on the Tracks).  There are some train themes going on in there too.  When an order is ready, a whistle sounds, and they also have a drink called \"Wreck of the Ole' 97.\"  Tavern on the Tracks is definitely a decent place to hang out, have some drinks, and eat some decent bar food.   If you're a Buffalo transplant, have the wings here, but go to Lebowski's for beek on weck and haddock fish fry's.",

    "text": "Truthfully I've only been a few times now but have yet to be wowed so not my first destination choice. First time I hit up Tavern was last football season and I was beyond excited to get to the bar to join my friends and watch the Niners game (Go San Fran!). The place was decently busy and we order a round of drinks. The service is good, no complaints there, but I was a bit turned off when a server asked us to quiet down when someone in our group dropped a swear word... apparently there was families in the bar but my first thought was it's a sports bar... in the midst of football season... during a playoff game. Nonetheless, we stayed the rest of the game and watched the Niners dominate. Yeahhhhh  : )  I recently went over after work and posted up on the patio with a friend of mine for dinner. They were hosting trivia that night, which I love, and we opted to play but couldn't hear any of the questions on the patio...bummer... but we didn't want to move inside since the weather was so awesome so we sacrificed our scorecard. I picked out the steak in the grass sandwich, which is a filet topped with provolone. Quite tasty and pretty much exactly what I expected. Hey, it's pub food... but I'd order it again.   On another occasion I had the buffalo chicken sandwich... this thing was massive and the chicken breast was bigger than the bun itself. Highly impressed with the portion size and loved the crispy coating on the sandwich.   I'd most likely stop by again to grab a meal if I'm in South End debating where to go but I'll probably stick to watching my games at another bar.",

Even after a Panthers away game there were maybe 7 people in the restaurant and a guy walked by the host booth where we stood and told us to seat ourselves. After 15 minutes we realized no one was going to acknowledge us so I went to the bar and told the bartender what had happened and she said \"WHAT?!who told you that? He didn't tell us he sat you\"  so I sat back down and she had someone come serve us shortly after. We ordered 2 appetizers and some entrees. 30 minutes later our entrees come out so I kindly told the waitress to please cancel our appetizers because obviously there is no need for them now. (Note she hadn't mentioned why they hadn't been out yet or what the wait was) and she said \"ummm I think the cook already made them\" and walks away. After that she never came back to give us refills on our waters, never asked if we had everything we needed or if the food was okay. Please invest in training your staff. I love your food but time after time I have came back in hopes of a good experience and you let me down over and over again. With ten people in the restaurant it's not that hard to provide a decent experience. We sat under the \"go blue boulevard\" sign on 12/3/17 at 7:30 pm",

    "text": "Not sure why, but this was my first trip here since 2008. Sometimes it's hard to give ratings to a restaurant/bar when you really only want to rate your experience with one aspect. So, my 4 stars is simply for the bar, specifically on a Friday because of $3 drafts. They had a few good choices too. I'll be damned if I can remember exactly, but I know I had an OMB Dunkel and there were a few others that sounded like contenders for the next round (maybe a Dale's Pale Ale?). Don't expect a World of Beer selection of craft beers on draft, but enough to make it a reasonable spot to return if you're looking for a dive bar feel in Southend with a few good options on the cheap on a Friday.  It's more of a grabbing a drink with some friends rather than a taking your special lady out type of place.",

Was I surprised! I thought this place was good for just bar food but they had an awesome appetizer selection (the hot peppers were terrific) along with steaks and pasta that was out of this world. I wasn't expecting much from their entree selection but was pleasantly surprised by the flavor on the steak along with the spicy cajun pasta they offered. I  This is the bar to go to if you're a Michigan or Bills fan ---get their early as it fills up (sometimes you don't even have room to stand comfortably)or if you're just looking to get you're drink on after work for some beers ($3 pints on Fridays). They have a spacious wrap around bar with good views of the tv's and a nice porch. Easily accessible from the Light Rail but sometimes parking can be a pain in the butt.",

First of all, the door is basically jammed, me having an ankle injury that day, didn't make my first impression that great.  I literally came shoulder first through the door.  I sat with some friends and took a couple minutes for me to get a beer.  There were some tv's and some stuff to look at, but seemed like no real substance to the place.

    "text": "ZERO STARS.DO.NOT.GO.HERE.  I signed up for Yelp just to WARN others.  I've lived in Charlotte for years and have never had such a terrible experience anywhere.  By far the worst establishment in the city.  My car was towed and the tow company demanded $350 cash or $420 credit to get my car back.  If I didn't get it by midnight it was an extra $75 fee and additional fees per day after that.  The bar and towing company are in on it together.  They have someone in the parking lot watching you leave your car in order to tow you immediately.  I was not the only vehicle to be towed.  When the others arrived they were told $350 cash.  When we told them we paid less, the Towing manager became infuriated and told them it didn't matter and tried to block them from seeing our receipt by putting themselves between us and the others.  The Carolina's Towing company car lot is in a very unsafe part of town with sketchy people roaming around everywhere.  Our uber driver said he witnesses this at $400 a car DAILY and would not let my wife and her sister (who was planning on moving to CLT) out of his vehicle because it was NOT safe.  Tavern on the Tracks should be absolutely ASHAMED of themselves (manager Robert) and I have no idea how the City of Charlotte allows Carolina's Towing LLC to operate in this unethical manner by taking advantage of its tax paying citizens!  Shame on all of you.  I'm disgusted and will never be back to this establishment.",

They had four bartenders working, which being a career bartender myself thought that was sufficient. All 4 of the bartenders seemed to be focused on the front of the bar closest to the patio. One girl stood between my buddy and I for a half hour before being seen. They took her order, but we sat there for another 10-15 minutes with empty beers. Finally the bartender asked my buddy what he wanted and he told him. I told the bartender that I would like a Blue light and put the drinks on my tab. He put my friends drink on my tab...but I sat for another 10 minutes before a different tender got me a beer. We both had 1 beer the entire second half of the game. It seems to me they were not prepared or organized to handle the crowd they had although it is the hotspot every Bills game.  This was the last time I will be at Tavern on the Tracks for a Buffalo Bills football game. I really like their food, and when their slow the service is ok and will definitely be back for a beef on wyke, but not for a game.",

Even though it was Friday they had a great drink special of $3 drafts, including my favorite Red Oak. We started with the ravioli appetizer which came out promptly and was generously stuffed with mozzarella and lightly fried. I had the steak, medium well with asperagus and mac and cheese. Even though slightly cooked past the medium well I ordered the meat retained the desired tenderness and it was well seasoned. As a huge fan of asperagus I was happy to see several stalks cooked at the perfect point between crunchy and soft. The only disappointment in the meal was the mac and cheese which was a cross between pasta salad and mac and cheese, but I suppose I could be spoilt with the creamy twice baked traditional mac and cheese of the south. The meal for the price point ($14 for my 9 ounce steak and two sides) was excellent and we will definitely return!",
