Each time, at various times of the day, we were seated immediately. Staff had always been wonderful and prompt and our food, amazing as expected. The only hiccup was the 1st visit with my son, he ordered a kids pizza and i ordered one of their salads, because I LOVE their salads, but instead, the server had accidentally entered in a Flatbread \"small plate\", - i let the server know, he left the flatbread on our table & let me know it was comp'd (obviously), and he'd go place the salad order rush. No biggie. The flatbread had mushrooms & spinach & since I love both I tried it and it was so good, I tracked down the server quickly & told him not to worry about ordering the salad, I was fine with the Flatbread & not to comp it. It was a simple mistake that they went out of their way to correct & worked out in my favor because I ended up with something I wouldn't have tried normally, but was so good my mom & I ordered it on our future visits lol along with avocado egg rolls (omg) and other apps. AND the manager came over & they comp'd it anyways. So, no issues there lol. If I'm at the mall, I'll go to CPK any day over the 'other' chain restaurant there.  :-)",

    "text": "I was recently diagnosed with Celiacs so while shopping at the mall and hungry my boyfriend and I wondered where we'd eat.  We saw a sign that California Pizza kitchen now had a gluten free menu so we decided to check it out.  As it turns out they had just started the GF menu a week prior.  I had the mushroom pepperoni sausage (GF) and Tim had BBQ chicken (non GF).    They have 4 pizzas that are certified GF and made in their own station to prevent cross contamination.   You can order any pizza with GF crust but they are made in the normal prep area.  They follow the strict guidelines of the Gluten Intolerance Group.   The head chef came out and explained all procedures in making their GF pizza to assure me that there would be no cross contamination and the manager brought my food out, explaining that he had washed his hands and not gone near gluten before serving my food.  I was extremely impressed with their customer service and dedication to providing a safe place to eat for those of us with Celiacs and gluten intolerance, unlike The Cheesecake Factory which has a GF menu but makes all the pasta in the same water, GF and regular, which defeats the purpose of a GF menu for Celiacs.    But back to the pizza!  It was the most normal tasting GF pizza I've had, it was actually doughy and wasn't brittle or super thin.  Even Tim said he couldn't tell it was GF.  I'm definitely coming back!",

    "text": "CPK, as some know it, is an upscale pizza chain.  Upscale from say a Pizza Hut but not too upscale, as you can dress casually.  At one time CPK was kind of special.  Now you can get their pizza anywhere from standalone locations, to airports (Chad E.) to your grocer's freezer section.  So, it was on this visit that I decide to NOT get the pizza.  As typical for any place near South Park mall at lunch, the place was packed.  Fortunately, we were seated quickly and promptly waited on.  Upon pursuing the menu and not wanting pizza, I came across my selection...Carnitas Tacos.  The order arrived at the table as two flour tacos w/ not too spicy shredded pork in the middle of each taco.  Topping these tacos was salsa verde, shredded lettuce, cabbage, red onions, and cilantro.  The dish does come w/ avocado but I nixed that topping.  W/ a squeeze of lime, these tacos were pretty decent.  Great flavor and filling w/out leaving you stuffed.  The side of tortilla chips was the only part of the meal that tasted overly processed...like corn flavored Baked Lays.    All of this for $10.75 was a little pricey for two tacos and chips.  But then again, you are in SP and everything here is a little pricey.  I recommend this dish as a great healthy alternative to a cheese laden pizza.",

So, three star you ask...Service. Very slow & the servers seem to be overwhelmed with the amount of tables they have or distracted.

They have a decent selection of pizza, pasta, and salads, the seating and orders are always prompt and service is usually pretty good.  Though it's outdoor seating is less than desired, the indoor area is nice.  Prices are reasonable since its in South Park Mall and it's much better than the airport version.  Salads are fresh and customizable.  The pizza cooked with a little burn on them, typical of an oven style.  They have decent lemonade too.  I would recommend this as a valid alternative if you don't want to wait at the Cheesecake Factory or Maggiano's and don't want to succumb to the bourbon chicken offered at the food court.",

In the grand scheme of things, I wouldn't suggest that its pizza is the best or anything, but let's just say that I'm partial to a few things on the menu and that's what keeps me coming back.  First off, I'm a big fan of the BBQ chicken chopped salad. I order it with extra avocado. That's usually my go-to. If I'm in a pizza mood it is usually something with chicken in it or possibly the carne asada. I'm not a huge fan of their appetizers, generally. I like that you can request honey wheat dough.  The service here isn't that great. And the wait times can be outrageous. I've had a couple of really bad experiences with wait times here and can honestly say that you should not come here if you're in a hurry.   But since I am a creature of habit and I've grown to like a few of the dishes, I'll be back. I think the dining experience can be ok here as long as you plan accordingly.",

Our waitress took our drink orders and I ordered a water with lemon as I always do. She brought our drinks about 5 minutes later and I noticed she did not bring the lemon. I asked politely if she could bring some lemon and she brought me one lemon slice on a plate....five minutes later.    I ordered some type of salad and specifically asked for no tomatoes on top. After waiting about 20 minutes for this tiny salad, it was delivered to my table with guess what, tomatoes on top! The waitress ran off before I had a chance to say anything. When she eventually returned to refill my water glass, I was picking the tomatoes out one-by-one. She managed to mumble \"sorry about the tomatoes\" before disappearing again.   Now, heaven forbid I was actually allergic to tomatoes! She made it very clear that she did NOT know how to listen. She did not offer to have the salad remade and I pretty much never saw her until she delivered the check.   I left unhappy and unsatisfied. It's unfortunate that decent customer service is so hard to come by. However, I will not be visiting this CPK anytime in the future.",

But the soggy exterior was not the most offensive part.  I took one bite of the pork taco and thought that the server got my order wrong. The inside of the soggy taco was filled with cubes of greasy fried pork! I thought to myself 'What in the world?' Oh and if the mushy oily texture was not enough of an insult to my pallet, let me add that the entire bite was bland.   The combination of the soggy taco and cubes of greasy fried pork left me speechless and grossed out.  The server came around to see how things were going and I told him I was expecting a different experience with pork taco. He asked me if I would like something else and I told him no. If the cook could destroy something as simple as a taco which is as easy to make as a sandwich, I was not interested in anything else on the menu.",

I was here for work so I have never been to this location before, but I have been eating at CPK since I was younger. As much as I love this place, I wish they would just come back with their Peking Duck Pizza they used to have!!  This location in particular, I sat outside for lunch and thought the patio was pretty spacious for shopping mall. The view was also nicer than some of the other ones I have been to and you are staring at a parking lot. The waiter I had was very fast and friendly as well, definitely a place I would stop at if I had to get food and be in and out.   I ordered the small plate wedges salad as well as the hawaiian pizza while I was there. The small wedge salad was pretty good, I mean you can't really mess up a salad so I can't complain. The thing I love about the CPK pizzas is the crust, it is not flavorless and always really sweet. Kind of like a Kings Hawaiian roll on a pizza, which is why I make a point to order the pizza everytime I am there. When I ordered this pizza at this location, the crust did not taste like it was supposed to and I was disapointed!! My favorite part is the crust and I did not eat any of it on this visit. The crust was kind of burnt and not very good. I was not very happy, but at least I do not live close to this location",

I finally decided to stop in, though.  The environment was nice and the servers were very friendly.  My favorite part of the meal was probably the complimentary warm bread.  It came with olive oil and had an great crispy crust.    For lunch I got the Waldorf Salad, which was huge, and it was pretty good.  I did not have a chance to try and of their cocktails, but I am not sure if the restaurant feels like the place where I want to go to in order to enjoy some drinks.  For a quick lunch/dinner in the mall after burning up some calories all day, I would definitely recommend CPK.",

We eat at the one at Lenox mall at least 8 times a month and never see anything like this. This CPK is horrible!!!!! Can't believe I have stopped here on the way back to Atl and waisted all this time!!!  To edit the manager ended up buying our meal and tried to make it right, but after 7 hours in a car and no food since breakfast with 5 more hours to go to get back home....... I would have rather been eating right now and paid than waiting for a recook!  EDIT: I am only going to edit this because the assistant general manager Mr. Bob. Mr. Bob I have to say you change my mind about the CPK here in South Park. Even though they messed up our food the way that you are and how personable you work and how nice you were and taking care of the whole situation plus more made us really enjoy our stay even though we had to wait for our food again. Thank you very much Mr. Bob we appreciate it and we will try again when we come back through.",

    "text": "Very disappointing and I didn't even eat there. My very first job was a hostess for a CPK and the people I talked to did an awful job. Once I made my selection on the prompt a girl picks up the phone and says, \"hello\"....hello? I'm not calling your personal phone! How about your name and where I'm calling? Duh! Then she couldn't tell me anything about delivery, said she should though and then transferred me to the guy who would. He was equally underwhelming. I asked if they delivered and he said yes but his delivery guy is out. That was it. So I inquired further...out delivering or out for the night and then he says out for the night. Jesus what is wrong with the youth nowadays. Most seem to have no work ethic and seriously lack common sense and customer service.  UPDATE: Within a business day the store manager reached out to me and apologized for my experience. He said they are currently undergoing a service training company wide. While I applaud them for this corporate wide effort this is definitely something they could do internally. Again, when I worked at a CPK we never had these issues.",

I used to love their roasted veggie salad and Cali club pizza. I was seated relatively promptly and started perusing the menu. Whoa. The prices tho... I ordered a half salad and a pizza and waited patiently. The food was all ok. Nothing mind blowing. Definitely not good enough to justify the price. The service was fine and the ambiance was fine. Everything was just meh. With the number of amazing local joints in the area dishing up great food with smiles, I don't know why I'd return. Save your dollars and go find a local spot.",

I drove over 30 minutes here last week to be able to sit outside and I get there and they say that they are not seating outside because they don't have enough servers. Such a bogus answer! So I can sit inside but that same server can walk my food outside. Not cool. So they seat us at this booth that is made for children. Not even enough space for 2 pizzas. Not a smart move on their part. I love the pizza here but this \"not having servers\" is starting to drive me away.",

    "text": "Normally, this restaurant has a great reputation.  In Florida, it was one of my favorite places.  Here in the Southpark location in Charlotte, it is actually really bad.  The last few times I went, the service was terrible, the hostesses rude, the food was bland and skimpy on portions, and the atmosphere awful.    The very last time I went, it was so bad, that I emailed the corporate office to let them know they are being represented poorly here in charlotte, and they sent me a couple of free meal coupons. So, this past weekend, I went there to give them one last try.  Upon arrival, I noticed quite a few tables out on their patio, and the day was glorious...74 and totally sunny.  Once inside at the hostess stand, I requested a table on the patio.  She told me they had \"stopped seating outside\", and it was 1:00pm??  I then said, well I guess we have to sit inside, which she then told me there was a 15-20 minute wait.  When I questioned all of this (since there were no people waiting, and the dining room was practically empty, she said they were short-staffed.    Wow!  Talk about your horrible management!  This is so sad.  I hate to see a good company go down because of horrible management.  Needless to say, I did not stay to eat, and will never return to this location again.  I do wish there was another Charlotte location in the Ballantyne area that had a different manager so they could be as wonderful as they are in other states.",

    "text": "I have been here multiple times and usually love it here. However last night I had family in from out of town and we stopped by the pizza kitchen after being told the nicer restuarants around the mall had over 2 hour waits. We were told the wait at the pizza kitchen was only 20 minutes and decided to add our name to the list. We came back 20 minutes later and were told it would be an additional 20 minutes because the current table they picked for us was still seated. Not a problem, we browsed another store and came back to be told the table was STILL occupied. We decided to have a seat and since the small waiting area was full, the hostess told us if we sat right outside they would come call us when it was ready.   After waiting a full hour from our original check in, we went back for the 4th time and the hostess told us our name was called, and when no one claimed the table they sat another party. We immediately asked why no one ever came to call us in the seating area and they simply said we usually recommend someone waits inside the restaurant. No apology, no further accommodations.   Needless to say we left and waited for the buzzer from maggianos to go off and had a MUCH more enjoyable experience.   I hope this was just a service fluke and not an every day thing, but it will make me think twice before returning.",

Back by Urban Outfitters and The Container Store, I would park elsewhere and walk through the mall.  Since it is located right next to the food court, parking is awful.  Even at 11:15, folks were starting the Battle Royale for parking spots (and the spots are narrow - my 4runner was taking up the entire spot - I would not park there again).    My lunch dates were already seated when I got there and the friendly hostess showed me to them - on a Friday at 11:15 there was a light crowd, but folks were starting to roll in as we were leaving.    I quickly ordered a diet Coke and since I had checked out the menu online beforehand, I knew I wanted to try the Caramelized Peach Salad which contained field greens and spinach (all tender greens, no tough or bitter), warm peaches, dried cranberries, gorgonzola cheese and toasted pecans with a white vinaigrette (I had them leave off the red onions).  Their salads can be ordered in 1/2 portions, which is what I got ($8), and it was more than enough for a light lunch.  You can add bacon, chicken, etc for an upcharge.  Everything blended well, it wasn't over-dressed, though the vinegar was pretty stout and I would not have been angry about having a few more pecans.  Nice portion with fresh ingredients, it was just right.    Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  He managed us and a few other tables (one was a large party of clucking females) with ease.  Little one's cheese pizza looked pretty darn good, so I will probably return again (*after* the holidays) to check it out.",

Being attached the South Park Mall, which I don't tend to enjoy....ever puts a damper on ever having to eat here.   I just don't like their menu. The pizzas are one size and barely serve as pizza in first place. The pies are all one size and lack in execution. The California Club, BBQ Chicken, Margherita, and Thai Chicken all sound good, but tend to be piled with too much and lack the done-ness I like. The only pizza I can really give honorable mention to is the Pear Gorgonzola. It's a nice combo and works rather well.   Worst part? Service. Shocking? Not really. It seems that they hire for ease rather than expertise. Multiple times I've experienced servers who were clueless or just straight up...not there. If you're in a hurry and need to get out quick, good luck. It's the biggest part of the business and also seems to be the part they pay the least amount of attention.   Up the service game, gents.

Not only that, but now you have to pay an extra $3 for bacon, which was always an included topping.  I wouldn't spend $20 on a pizza that would serve one person of average appetite very often.

We had to ask for every refill, and I don't remember him ever coming to check on us. When we asked for a second plate of bread (the first plate only had one small piece per person), he seemed annoyed. We finished eating and sat at the table for another 20 minutes. Not one plate was ever bussed from the table. They were out of avocados and several other items that we wanted. We inquired about it and the server said, \"Sunday mornings get really busy\". If Sunday mornings are normally busy, why not order enough avocados to last all day? (I know the fact that they are out is not the servers fault whatsoever, but he offered no apology for the inconvenience) The manager came over while we were having a big conversation and interrupted the person who was talking, rather than waiting for them to finish. Overall it was a mediocre experience and I will probably not return.",

The spiced pecans and champagne vinaigrette were especially good. My issue was with the pizza. The shaved mushroom and spinach pizza was soggy and gross. I took a few bites and just couldn't eat a mush pizza. I tried a piece of the BBQ chicken pizza as well. While not soggy, the BBQ sauce was sickeningly sweet. I wouldn't have normally dropped a restaurant rating all the way to two stars since a lot of what I had was good, but the pizza was bad and it IS a pizza place after all. Good pizza isn't rocket science. Stop trying to church it up and make a good, simple product.   If you should find yourself here against your will, go with a salad.",

As someone who tries to make health conscious choices when ordering from the menu yet always finds the selections unappealing, CPK's menu is like a breath of fresh air!!! The Pizza selections are great and the food is always excellent!   The staff is always extremely pleasant, probably due to the amazing leadership of management. Nina is simply AWESOME! Always fun and engaging, Nina is exceedingly personable and always makes sure you feel valued and important!",

He did this as he was leaving so we were constantly saying no no. Just the things we asked for. Don't add extra stuff onto our bill. Then when it was time for the check, he was nowhere to be found until he rolled up saying \"you want dessert, right?\" I realize they want you to spend more money at their establishment, but it felt like he was trying to trick us into paying for things we didn't ask for.

I really want the Thai chicken egg rolls from CPK, but we hate the one here in Charlotte...\"  After debating it for a bit and being unable to come up with something else that would satisfy her taste craving, we both decided to give it another try.  We were both surprised for the better.  I'm betting that there was a management change somewhere in the past year as this place seems to have turned around.  The glass and doors were clean of fingerprints (pretty good given it was 2pm on a Saturday, after a lunch rush) and the greeters were friendly.  The waiter missed a drink order, but when I reminded him he quickly apologized, made a joke and came running w/ the drinks.  Our salad was cold and crisp.  The food was hot and fresh and I was particularly happy with a California Veggie Pizza that had several types of vegetables on it.  I hesitated to order it as they different veg would require different levels of cooking to get to a good finished product but the kitchen staff pulled it off beautifully.  It was delicious.  I'll bump 'em up to 4 stars for now and will probably be back in the future.",

I picked my daughter up from school for lunch to celebrate getting into her first choice for college and thought we could order as takeout and ask if we could actually dine in so it would be ready when we got there. When we got there, we discovered that the restaurant wasn't open yet and we waited.  They were a few minutes late opening so the restaurant was completely empty.  I asked for a manager so we could see if we could dine in, since we were now starting to run low on time.  She responded by saying that take out was  for take out and that she could do it THIS time since it was slow.  The tone was condescending and she informed me that they do it that way because servers depend on tips.  I told her that was why I was asking BEFORE I paid for the meal so we could tip.  It was entirely too much drama so early in the morning.  Managers need to be trained to solve problems and not create them.  Your restaurant is completely empty and you act like it's a bother to seat me for lunch, when 'm stating that I have no problem tipping.  That just makes no sense...    The simple way to handle this would have been to say, \"Sure, I can transfer your ticket to a table ticket and have one of our servers take care of you.\"",

While our meal was being served, the manager came over and spoke to us. She was very knowledgeable and displayed great customer service. We ended the meal with the Butter Cake and the Chocolate Souffle Cake. Both were very tasty.   I look forward to returning tomorrow afternoon for my next business trip to Charlotte!",

    "text": "When you eat here, expect to feel as if you a bother to the employees. My friend and I ate here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and sadly I believe it will be my last visit.  The host area is unorganized and unattended. After another employee got the host a few ppl ahead of got seated and then we did. Upon being seated it took several minutes for the waitress to show up. (& it was not slammed, so being busy isn't an excuse)  Her demeanor and attitude was very unfriendly. Her service was poor. Meaning the amount of time it took to get our good and drinks, never once got a refill, and taking awhile to process our checks.  The only ounce of friendliness was when she dripped the checks off BC she was thinking about us tipping.  She acted like she hated being there.  And the the same attitude with the food runner.   The food itself was ok. I got the chicken wrap app as a meal and my friend got a salad. But in my opinion it's over priced for mediocre food and bad service. Do yourself a favor, save time and money and go to the food court instead.",

    "text": "Errr,, ummm,,, I'm definitely struggling for words here. I'm trying to comprehend how the pioneer of the Buffalo chicken pizza is now serving uninspired,  lackluster pizzas. Every time I took a bite out of my Thai Chicken and The Works pizza, I'm a bit dumbfounded how a popular place like this can serve severely bland tasting pizzas.     The food was so blah,, we ended up playing the \"would you rather...\" game.     A: Would you rather eat pizza from CPK or Pizza Hut?    B: Pizza Hut!!     A: Would you rather eat pizza from CPK or Little Caesars?     B: Little Caesars!!  Yes, it was that bad. I don't know if these guys are actually tasting their food, but whoever the head chef/cook in that establishment should definitely invest in some tastebuds.     Lowest rating would be a one star, but the extra star is for their service,,, the host seated us right away, we received our waters,, ordered our drinks and food in a timely fashion. Our server was on point and we were well taken cared of. Even my beer came frosty cold.   It's such a shame that amidst all that stellar service,, the quality of food eclipsed all their hard work. This CPK sorta did it for me, it'll probably take a bit til I step into one of these joints again. Hopefully it's not the case in other CPKs.     Weeeeeeeeeee",

I ordered water with cucumber, not your usual water with lemon. She kindly shaved me some cucumber. When I asked what's the Spiked Cucumber, she gave me full description and made it just as I requested. When I ordered my garden salad and asked for basic Italian dressing, she suggested an awesome lemon vinaigrette. For my entree I went with Shrimp Scampi Zucchini. Maybe I missed the description on the menu, but I was not aware it came with linguini, pasta I did not need. I told her I could pick around it, but she insisted and had a pasta free dish made. Her only goal was seeing me smile.  It's service like this you expect when you go out to enjoy a meal. No, it's not Spago or Nobu, but service is key no matter where you're dining.   Good food, but 5 stars go to Eva!",

Hopefully someone at corporate reads these reviews and can execute better service and decisions for those still spending dollars at CPK",

We arrived on Sunday afternoon and the place wasn't too packed. Our waitress arrived and welcomed us and before we could ask any questions she let us know what they were out of...Hmmm okay. Why are you out of so many options? Especially the specials?   They didn't have several of the special items, some salads or pizzas. That was a bit frustrating. I ended up ordering the wedge salad and the carne asada pizza.   The wedge salad was a huge disappointment. The iceberg lettuce was brown, the presentation was awful and the dressing had a bit of an aftertaste. I would not recommend.   The pizza was very underwhelming. It lacked flavor and for the price I expected so much more. The menu boasts of an awesome combination of flavors which include tender marinated steak, fire-roasted poblanos, cilantro pesto, yellow onions, mozzarella, monterey Jack and fresh cilantro. Served with a side of housemade salsa verde.  What we got was tough steak, salsa verde which lacked flavor and the crust was a bit wet and soft on the bottom. Not a fan.   I'll pass on the next visit.",

Everything on this pizza just works great together and its a nice alternative to my usual fave of getting NY style pizza in Charlotte.

I would always go there and order the same thing Tortilla soup and the greek pizza. Once in a while, when I felt adventurous, I would try something new.   However, this place was not the same. The tortilla soup was probably the only good thing I had. The greek pizza was ok and the hawaiian pizza was so bad that I could not believe it was even on the menu. It was dry and looked unappealing. Dominos makes a better hawaiian! Gosh that was harsh but I was really disappointed.   The service was not that great either. Our waitress was not very attentive and we had to ask her several times for things since she would forget. When ordering beer she had no idea which beer was which to her credit she was under 21 but she didn't even offer to check. It was just an overall bad experience. Maybe it was a bad day for CPK but I doubt I will return. Too disappointing.",

The Server, Susan  came by to ask about my meal after I had pushed it to the end of the table, barely half eaten. I told her that it was just ok.  She said that the Salmon was better and left to continue working.   Susan came back before I left to ask if I wanted anything else.  I regret that I did not ask to speak with the manager.  I should have also asked that at least the wine be taken off of my bill.  I wasted $25.00.  I do not plan on eating at CPK again.  I also plan on telling everyone that I know about this experience.

Then the main course of barbecue chicken pizza came. It tasted quite great.  While talking with my company, the waiter came, and instead of refilling my drink that had been empty for quite some time, he took my lat piece of pizza and the spinach artichoke dip away without asking if I was finished or if I wanted a box! (Which I did as I was still eating the pizza and planned on boxing the dip).  He then finally refilled my drink- halfway. That was the cherry on top-- after the whole mess of a night he only refilled my drink half way even though he had an entire pitcher at his disposal.

This visit the only thing I didn't enjoy was that the place has two entrances and the hostess had some difficulty determining who came in first (even though we were very polite when telling her that we had come in ahead of another group) they were on her list first so they got seated first. If a place has two entrances and they are getting busy, its a good idea to establish a line and stick to it. The only reason we were there was because our first choice restaurant had a 2.5 hour wait and CPK only had a 30 min wait. Anyways, once we were seated everything was good. Our server Elisabeth was great. We had the Focaccia bread and the Fried Macaroni small plate as our appetizers. The bread was good and the mac was ok. The breading on the mac was delicious the mac in itself was a bit lacking in flavor. We had three pizzas at our table - The Meat Cravers on orig crust, Jamaica Jerk Chicken thin crust, and Hawaiian BBQ. The Jamaican Jerk was spicy but very tasty! All three were really good. The flavored lemonades and teas were good. All in all, we had a good experience. Standard CPK from what we've experienced. Good food and good service and reasonably priced.
