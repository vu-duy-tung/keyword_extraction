Especially the urban cowboy and the Buffalo chicken wrap. That dessert with the warm cookie and the ice cream is crazy crazy good too. If you're having a good week you deserve it.  Back to the service! My hats off to the management team for hiring such a great lineup of the servers hosts and cashiers. I have managed teams before and it's not easy to get a team this well orchestrated right off the bat. Really really really well done guys. They were helpful, they were excited that we were here, they were excited that we have now returned for the third time in as many weeks as they've been open. They encouraged us to try new things, even let us taste a few things, and I am glad they did because it was all so good.  I'm glad this place is so good because I will continue to get to eat here for the foreseeable future! This place won't have any trouble at all staying in business and doing well! It's a great addition to the Park Road Shopping Center and our neighborhood. Keep it up guys!",

We recently stopped by this Park Road restaurant for a meal with our grandkids and found great menu choices for reasonable prices.  The Lime-Marinated Steak and Rice was tasty and tender.  The Turkey Crunch sandwich was outstanding.  Their secret is hickory smoked cooking. And serving is as good as the food.  Menu choices for kids will satisfy the most finicky of young diners but the grilled peanut butter fluff was a big hit. It's also the cleanest restaurant we've visited in quite some time.",

Atmosphere was excellent and I do think they will get their act together. I agree with the other guy...BGE = Burger. Would also suggest char those peppers and onions.

The chicken was well seasoned and moist, the vegetable side was cooked perfectly (not mushy and slightly firm), and the rice was fluffy and soft. Each entree comes with an orange roll - imagine a cross between a croissant the iced orange cinnamon roll.  I also had the fresh made strawberry lemonade, which was perfectly sweet and tangy.  I highly recommend this restaurant to someone interested in a well balanced & quick meal.  Prices are comparable to Panera Bread or Jason's Deli.",

This gave me expectations that the food would be pretty good, but it was disappointing.  I had the BALT (bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato) sandwich. The bread had been grilled like a grilled cheese, but whatever oil they used to grill it wasn't butter, because it only added grease to the bread and no flavor.  The bacon was not crispy and the lettuce was sparse.  I think the tomato was probably pretty good but the overall texture and flavor of the sandwich was disappointing. I had the broccoli salad as my side and I think the broccoli and grapes in it were fresh, but the salad had sugar or some sweetener in it that made it too sweet.  I did have a chocolate shake and that was very good.  I'll give this place another try with another dish because I liked the space and the people, but my first experience was definitely a \"meh\".   Oh one other negative:  This brand new restaurant only had the option to swipe your credit cards, which puts customers credit card numbers at more risk of being stolen than a chip reader or an NFC reader for Apple Pay or other contactless payment methods.  It really makes no sense that a brand new store would put its customers credit card numbers at risk by using old magnetic swipe technology at its registers.",

My mom and I stopped in for a late lunch and we were greeted with such warmness from the staff. We got the berry salad and the white chicken bbq sandwich with homemade strawberry lemonade. My mom and I were blown away by the flavor both our dishes packed! My moms salad had the best chicken and freshest berries. My sandwich was juicy and the flavor was on point! Crystal came out and checked on us several times, refilling our drinks and checking in on how it all tasted. To top it off she even sent over a complimentary skillet cookie! Major brownie points in our book lol! My mom is a major food critic and couldn't stop raving about how she had the best salad she's ever had at Urban Cookhouse! We will be back!",

It's like something I would love to cook for myself at home, but could never make it taste THAT good. They cook everything on big green eggs, which makes the flavor even better. They cater to your needs even though you order at the counter and always check on you and take care of you. Veggie quesadilla is my fav, but everything is excellent and I've tried almost all of it!",

I believe its a fairly new place, so the interior was modern, fresh and very open.  Its walk up service and number card system,  but don't let that give you pause,  because some full service restaurants could learn a thing or two about \"customer service\"  from this restaurant.   They were just very attentive but not overly so.  The food was  ery good too,  can't recall the names but you'll get the gist from the pics.  Its located in a cool part of Charlotte and competition is fierce,  but if they keep up the service with the very good food, they'll be champs.",

    "text": "Pricier than expected.  $25-30 for 2 for lunch is high to me for what the experience offered.  Salads are $9 and there's not much on them other than wet romaine.  Why is the salad so wet like they didn't even shake it after running it through water.  That's off putting.  The B(A)LT Sandwich is not very good.  I'm a professional complainer but it has serious problems.  The bacon is shiny because it's cooked in oil.  Bacon doesn't need to be cooked in oil.  When you cook bacon in oil and take a bite the first flavor that hits your mouth is cooking oil which defeats the purpose of using bacon.  On a BLT you should taste bacon!  Bacon is already the fat.  They are only adding oil because it cooks faster instead of taking the proper time to utilize a great product and cook it right.    Also \"on toast\" here means griddled in A LOT of butter.  So if you're non-dairy like me you want to order the toast \"dry\".  I ordered it dry at the register but still had to have it remade because they forgot.  As a sandwich if you don't get ham or turkey, which is extra, there's not much to the B(A)LT.  (A) is for avocado but it's just a teaspoon of light spread.    Rice pilaf side has butter so I can't eat it since I'm non-dairy.  Roasted veggie side is mostly mushrooms that have cooked down and released water so everything tastes boiled.  There's no roasted flavor on them and they don't look like they spent any time in an oven.  If it was just called sauteed vegetables I wouldn't have been bothered.  But when you say \"roasted\" it creates an expectation.  Not waiter service but you order and they give you a number and run the food out to your table.  They also bus the tables for you.  But possibly because of that all the tables were pretty dirty both times we visited.  Not just un-bussed tables but most tables had a lot of shrapnel from previous guests.  They could add self-service stations for customers to discard your own dishes to take a load off the food runners.  But without servers shouldn't it be cheaper than it is?  The first silverware I unwrapped was dirty.  After two visits I don't think I would go again.",

So I couldn't wait to see.what exactly n this eatery would offer. I thought it was going to be some fancy place that offered fresh and local eats. Much to my surprise it's very fast casual dining and the food is good. The menu isn't expansive, which is great for someone like me who can be indecisive when it comes to choosing a great meal. After perusing the menu, I landed on the lime marinated steak. I substituted the rice for the hot cheese pasta aka mac and cheese and the salad for the sauteed veggies. Everything was delicious. I'm pretty skeptical about mac and cheese are restaurants but their mac and cheese was really cheese (like the baked kind, not the velveeta cheesy kind) and had good flavor. The steak was already sliced when it came on the plate and it was flavorful and tender. The roasted veggies had carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, onions and zucchini and were well seasoned. The dish came with a warm orange roll which was delicious. The warm orange roll is as if a croissant and yeast roll had a baby.

    "text": "We decided to try something new today and have it postmate'd to us.  Their online menu looked good and the pictures from google reviews also looked good so we thought this would be a winner... we were wrong :-(  They got our order wrong so one (of our three) lunchers got no lunch because it was not what she ordered.  My order was correct, but it still left a lot to be desired.  i ordered a very safe selection of the grilled chicken meal with salad, rice and the little orange roll.  I figured how hard could that be?  The grilled chicken arrived chopped up, wrapped in tin foil, and  sitting inside my salad.  The salad was basic, nothing at all special.  Unfortunately, the chicken was also basic, dry, and without much flavor at all.  My goal was not to put it in my salad, my goal was to cut it up and eat it like adults do.  The rice I got was just plain, simple rice that lacked flavor... just bleh.  The little orange roll thing that they rave about was also just kinda bleh.  It was tougher than I'd anticipated, heavy and sugary with a faint hint of orange.  All of this was average at best, but the real shocker was their choice in carry out containers.  The weight of the food inside is literally too much for the container so the moment I touched it to lift it from the bag it was delivered in, it started ripping and denting and losing it's structural integrity... so much that I had to immediately set it back down or it would have bent and my food would've fallen on the floor.  Upon further inspection (because I simply couldn't believe how flimsy it was) it really appeared that the container used to be white and had been spray painted black?!?  I say this because the black paint was bubbly across the top, not smooth nor was it consistent all over the same container...  just weird and off putting.  If you can afford the rent in Park Road Shopping Center, then please up your carry out container game as the choice you made in no way accomplishes the goal it was produced to accomplish.  Nope - one time of this was enough for me, I won't be repeating this little debacle.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings about this place it has potential but kinda falls short right now. I agree with the one review that wondered why the Green Eggs weren't more visible, I too was expecting to see them cooking but they aren't really visible, not a big deal but it would be cool if you could see them.   On to the food. I ordered the Urban Cowboy. The flavor was very good. However, everyone at the table agreed it is a very small sandwich. Taking the bun off revealed they are extremely skimpy on the meat. The last one and a half inches of the already small bun didn't have any meat at all, just bare bread. Although this sandwich tastes good, for $10 bucks I probably wouldn't get it again, there's just not much there.   I was able to try the ribs, they were really good, tender with a good smoke flavor. One of our party ordered the BALT. they said it was ok but commented on how there was supposed to be avocado on it and there wasn't. Another ordered The Cookhouse wrap and said it was a little bland.   Overall we left not overly impressed.  It's not bad but it's not great either. Small portions for the price. That being said, it's a place I would try again in a few months after they work out the kinks and hopefully they will pay attention to what people are saying.",

The menu is simple with selections like sandwiches, larger plates, and salads. I opted for the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (my lunchtime favorite) and my mom got the BALT.   The service is super friendly, and I love the fact that the walls are lined with local items like hot sauce and honey for purchase. The fact that this places focuses on supporting local purveyors puts it very high on my \"return\" list. The interior is a bit cold both design wise and in temperature, but we found the outdoor patio to be very comfortable.   The food was absolutely delicious, and we both opted for the mac and cheese side. Cooking the meat on the Big Green Egg makes it incredibly tender, and really stole the show in what would be otherwise a fairly simple lunch selection.   I look forward to returning and trying even more on the menu (or maybe one of those take-home meals!)",

The ham was also overcooked but edible. The grilled pineapple was delicious and the broccoli salad awesome! The warm orange roll was delicious and different. The cheddar pasta (mac 'n cheese) was nothing noteworthy. First visit so I don't know if UC typically only has one employee to take orders, run the food, and bus the tables, refill drinks - basically do everything but cook. Chef salad had generous toppings and came with the delish warm orange roll. I will probably try them again but will stay away from the turkey for sure!",

If this is your hook, why hide it?  Instead, I was expecting something akin to a Japanese steakhouse all ablaze and smoky with my nose making decisions about what to eat.  But nope . . . is this just another joint cranking out OK food at premium prices?  Both our entrees (shrimp kabob and Buffalo chicken wrap) were overcooked and dry.  The seasonings amped up the flavor, but without it . . . boring.  The broccoli salad was moist and crunchy albeit the dressing was pretty sweet.  For two adults each having either a beer ($5) or wine ($6)  . . . reasonable prices on beverages, and a child portion of fluffer-nutter sandwich (awesome), our ticket was just over $38.00.  I think it was steep for what we received.   Their website states a commitment to \"Buy Local, Eat Urban\" ingredients.  Did they really buy the chicken at the farm down the road?  Which local farmer's market do they sponsor and purchase ingredients?  Tell me . . . I want to know.  I appreciate commitment to our local farms and will happily \"pay up\" for the consideration.  Urban Cookhouse has so much competition within walking distance, I say roll those damn cookers out and start grilling your asses off; especially, in the newly crowned high-rent district of Park Road Shopping Center.",

Walked in and it was an open and airy, loved the decor and focus on eating local and eating urban. The wood details, including a table shaped like NC gave this place a cool vibe. I was greeted by several staff members and was offered a sample of their strawberry milkshake. Yum.   While I waited for my friend to join me, I looked over the menu and decided to sit at a table and wait. A staff member offered me a complimentary adult beverage (wine or beer). When my friend arrived we went up to the counter to order, I ordered a local mix  and the half baked cookie and strawberry lemonade.   When my friends food arrived, I realized they were bringing me a wrap instead of salad, so I let them know I wanted the salad and they fixed my order. It did take a while for my salad to come out, but the manager and staff apologized and even gave me a coupon for my next meal to be free.   The salad was delicious. I added grilled chicken and it wasn't bland chicken like usual, it was seasoned and yummy.   The strawberry lemonade was delicious as was the half baked cookie. It did seem a bit pricey for both of those, but still yummy.   The staff took good care of us and refilled our drinks several times during our meal.   UPDATE: came for a second visit to use my coupon and found the staff very hospitable. Food special included pork tacos that were quite good.",

I got the shrimp & squash kabob plate which was served with a side salad and rice pilaf. The rice pilaf was made with cilantro and a lime on the side, which totally complimented the seasoning on the shrimp and squash. The dressing was a little sweet, but complimented the sharp cheddar on the salad. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the orange roll that's served with the plate. It was pretty good, and would probably be great on its own, but I didn't love it with this particular dish. I would've preferred a plain or buttered roll.   My only other complaint (and it's a tiny one), the seating is the most comfortable. The \"booths\" are made of these little benches attached to the wall...they're so close to the wall that you have to sit sit straight up, but they're not long enough to scoot away from the wall.   I'd definitely come back if in the area again.",

The wrap was a little messy and I was surprised that it didn't come with a side sauce or dressing. I asked the waitress for some of the honey mustard vinaigrette dressing and that was delicious.   The wrap for me was just okay. I love all the ingredients that come in it chicken, bacon, cheese and corn just to name a few. But the flavors for me were just all pretty average. The rice was seasoned well, but a little salty. I'd opt for a different side next time.   Overall, just okay in my book. I do want to come back and try a salad. Since I loved the dressing so much.

He was very friendly and accommodating and amusing!   We went outside on the patio and had a fabulous meal. The lunch conversation was suitable for NPR.  The weather was picture perfect and with the exception of an annoying fly or two, it was spectacular sitting outside. I had the plated chicken dish with a side of mixed vegetables and a salad.  The bowl of mixed vegetables was just not your average bowl of mixed vegetables. It was a WOW dish!   As everyone knows about this place, the plate came with an orange muffin kind of treat which caused guilty pleasure. All of the food was very scrumptious and I will be eager to return to bite down on more.  My only constructive advice is that the porch service could have been a little better. We were there for over four hours and saw a server outside only once or twice. (Perhaps she thought we had overextended our time??)  I am assuming that the servers were paying more attention to inside customers, although until I sit inside, I can't really comment.   I WILL say that people were friendly, the food was amazing, the menu offered a great selection, and the vibe was something that I could dig.   Maybe when Arlene is back in town, I will take her to this restaurant to see if she likes it as much as I did.",

I had a few good options and wound up ordering the veggie quesadilla. Most places where you order a veggie quesadilla, it comes with some cheese and maybe some beans and peppers... not this place! It comes LOADED with veggies: everything from broccoli to mushrooms! It was a large portion too and I left feeling almost too full. It came with all the fixins included: guac, sour cream, and salsa.   I was very impressed with the presentation of the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and attentive staff who checked on our waters even though this is an order and sit kinda place. Maybe it was because it was a weekend, but this place wasn't busy at all at lunchtime. I would definitely stop back here again. They also have beer and wine for a later meal :)",

I always got the lemon marinated steak plate.  You get grilled steak, rice, salad and a sweet roll for $10.  That is not a bad price for lunch around this area.  The steak always cook medium therefore it's very tender n juicy.  Great service, one of my colleagues's steak was over cooked and the manager exchanged for a new plate.",

It's my first time here, but I know I'll be back based on this first visit, so maybe another star soon!  I had the local (can't remember the brewery) watermelon lager.  I didn't really get the watermelon.  So I wouldn't get that again.  They do have a small selection of local beers and for a good sandwich shop that's enough.  They have a great selection of wine and I found a new \"current crush\"... The Floriography Rose.  So good.  I had already ordered the beer, but I appreciated the taste LouAnn offered me.  I ordered the El Cubano to go, with a side of cheddar pasta.  the pasta was ok.  Shell pasta, decent - a bit overdone, but it's pasta and cheddar cheese...What's not to love?  I added a little salt, not much.  The cuban sandwich had a southern spin with the white toast, but since I'm from the South and I love white bread  I'm ok with it.  In Miami I remember the long, thin crispy, soft bread hot-pressed with the ham, pork, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles for a thin, rich bite...such a good memory and I'm always looking for that, but...  I'll take Urban Cookhouse's version as a close second!  First, the charcoal-grilled meat is in the top 5 for grilled meat in the city.  Second, the flavors are there.  The yellow mustard, the crispy dill pickle and a lot of juicy, flavorful ham & pork.  So good and I will be back for that, but I'm excited to try other things as well.  I'm not a fan of seeing into the kitchen and it seems as if there is difficulty in communication between the kitchen staff and servers/managers so I hope that doesn't translate into errors on orders.  They have free-wifi which is great.  The music is background; pandora or something like that...it changes, but it's mostly older styles like 80's or MoTown.  I like the layout, plenty of inside space and a great outside patio.  I'm really happy for this addition to Park Road Shopping Center options and I look forward to visiting again!",

    "text": "\"Park Road Shopping center needs more restaurants\"...said no one ever.  Yet they managed to cram one more in!  Urban Cookhouse is a casual eatery next to the fancier Burton's.  It's one of those places where you order at the counter, they give you a number card and bring you your food.  I like it...it's simple.  I met a friend here for dinner.  The menu looked pretty good, with wraps, salads, etc.  I went for a wrap that had finely chopped turkey and sliced ham.  It was pretty good.  I also got this with a side of the broccoli salad (looked better than it tasted...was a little bland).  My friend got a salad and really enjoyed it.  Prices were pretty decent.  There were two big winners at Urban Cookhouse.  First, the Strawberry Lemonade rivals the one at Wendy's (which is awesome, by the way...like I didn't think i would find anything as good until my visit to UC).  Second, the service was really good.  While we were sitting, the staff came around a couple of times clearing empty dishes and asking if we wanted any refills.  I think this is a great place to go for lunch on the weekend.  Seems good for groups or families.",

There were constantly members of the staff checking on us and refilling our drinks.  They even brought out sample milkshakes for us to try.  The staff was very friendly as well!  I'm torn on the number of stars to give for the reasons below.  My husbands food came out way before mine and my parents and sisters food came out when my husband and I had completed our meals.  This was awkward because we finished eating 10 minutes before everyone else.   We weren't told that the chicken entrees take a lot longer until after we received our food.    I got the berry good wrap.  My husband got the Cuban.  We both felt the exact same way about our food... it was good but nothing spectacular.  We got the roasted veggies as our side.  They were really good but a small portion.  My sister got the turkey crunch and felt the same way about her meal.    My parents both had the chicken entrees with rice and salad and really enjoyed then and said their meals were flavorful and good.    Maybe if we decide to come back we will go the entree route.",

I had the lime steak with rice, and salad. It was cooked soo well, nice and tender and full of flavor. Oh, and it's $10! The two of us ate for $25, with drinks. Mine also came with this divine orange roll that's like a better version of a cinnamon roll. Every person who came into contact with us was friendly and warm. The gentleman who was working the dining room had a big personality and seemed to connect with every single table. We watched him work his magic with the many children dining tonight, even bringing an entire bowl of grapes to a child who wanted nothing to do with his fruit bowl. Clearly they care about the customers experience, which is nice to see in any restaurant. Thanks for turning around a dreary Monday with your positivity, we can't wait to come back!",

I loved this place because you can get a great tasting and healthy meal for ten bucks and that is really hard to find these days.  But it's not just the value that Urban Cookhouse offers that keeps me going back, it is the fact that so few places in Charlotte this type of service where I can go order at a counter and have grilled chicken, rice, and vegetables on my plate in like 6 minutes and it tastes great.  I love this location but really wish they had one uptown so I could go more often but this type of  place is exactly what I'm looking for post workout or if I just want to feel good about what I eat while also looking forward to eating it.  The crew inside is also great and extremely helpful and the inside is beautiful so don't take it to go!  We want this place to stick around a while so give them your business!  Food:  9.5/10 Value: 10/10 Service:  10/10 ambiance:  10/10  fast casual",

It was good, but pricy for the size of the portions. I left still feeling hungry or not satisfied.   The freshness can be tasted. I got the veggie quesadilla, filled with veggies it did not come with a side, and it was a little over $9. I did craved a few more bites of something.  Hubby had the cookhouse wrap with a side of cheddar pasta (Mac & cheese) it was good but he was looking for a more filling meal.   2 beers & 2 small dinner was $32. We left to go find a small snack or dessert .",

We went on a Monday and there were only a few customers there. Parking isn't an issue and it's very easy to find.   The staff was super friendly and helpful making recommendations. I ordered the white BBQ chicken sandwich with the cheddar pasta (mac n cheese) and it was one of the best mac n cheese I've ever had. My friend got the chicken salad and fruit plate and it was loaded with fresh seasonal fruit. My other friend ordered a salad and it was loaded with toppings and came in a huge bowl. It's definitely worth the money.   They also have draft and bottled beer and wine and really good looking desserts, but I didn't have enough room to try them. I will definitely be back!",

The Lady and I were here for a late lunch on a weekend and it was surprisingly empty - which made me raise an eyebrow for the quality of the food, especially for it being in Park Road Shopping Center. The space is beautiful and open with huge floor-to-ceiling windows and dark hardwood tables - their biggest table is in the shape of the state of NC. Gotta love all the nods to local stuff.   Food was brought out quickly (it's counter service), I ordered the Turkey Crunch sandwich with a side of the broccoli salad .The Turkey Crunch was wonderful - all flavors were perfect. The broccoli salad was sweet, but absolutely drenched (I feel like there was about 1/4 cup of the sweet-cream dressing left over when I picked out the pieces of broccoli). Too much for me, and it's a shame because the flavors were great. Just way too much of a good thing, you know?   Prices were decent for what we ordered, and we really enjoyed our experience. Devoured it all, which is always a good sign haha. Anyways, check out Urban Cookhouse for a quick lunch or any other meal! We'll definitely be back!",

The place was empty but clean. Similar dinning as Panera bread, but eclectic. There is a shared parking lot with the shopping center so you park wherever you can. The prices are decent and customer service is okay. They have share games you can play while you wait for your food, while you dine, or to play afterwards. I got a salad with the steak add on. It was a nice portion of Steak. It was tasty and very filling. I think it's a great place for the community. Enjoy!",

The price for the both of us to eat with drinks was relatively cheap considering the quality of the food. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious, and we plan on making this one of our go-to spots. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews! Highly recommend!!!",

When the sandwiches arrived my first thought was \"I didn't know these were sliders\". Well, they're not. They are just teeny tiny hogie buns. There was enough steak on there to satisfy me somewhat. The bowl of sauteed veggies was delicious but also a very small amount. My friend said his chicken was a little dry but he loved the broccoli salad. To summarize, the food wasn't bad but didn't do the Big Green Egg concept any favors. And we both left still hungry. At least the price somewhat reflects the tiny servings. I'm sure I will eat there again, trying something different.",

I've admired the great service, kind waitstaff as everyone was so eager to please and the food was always delicious! Tonight... not so much. It started with the person at register. She wasn't listening well to us and so I was concerned from the start. So drinks were missed (mistakes happen). We sit down and the food comes (partial). She didn't feel the need to bring the orange rolls out before even with the meal. She didn't get mine right -no apology on that or the orange rolls (mistakes happen but at least be nice). She comes out with rolls in a to-go box and my proper side. I then told her she may want to inform the chef that I found a nice bone in my chicken wrap. She looked at me funny and said ok and walked away. That's it! Again no apology. Usually someone walks around checking on drinks, see how everything turned out.. crickets. I'm so disappointed but overall not surprised as this happens often after a new place gets comfy. So In short, food is good but not great by any stretch like it was (maybe it was a bad night) but I'm hoping they step it up soon bc there is a lot of competition in park rd area and they need to stand out. We will definitely hesitate before returning.",

    "text": "Visited on their second day in business. Service was incredibly friendly and they were handing out samples galore so we could taste certain menu items. (We tasted a strawberry milkshake, the cookie dessert and the mac and cheese all on the house.) When we weren't sure what to order and were stuck between two items, they offered to let us taste a bit of one of them. The food was great (we had the chicken sandwich, broccoli salad, and lime-marinated steak) and loved them all. Definitely one of my new favorite spots in town.",

    "text": "Decided to pick up a quick bite for me and the hubs. The staff is very friendly and will offer samples of sides to help that final decision. Hubs got the grilled ham sandwich (which were 3 sliders) and we both loved those...the mustard has a little bite, but cooled down with the sweetness of the pineapple. He got the hot cheddar pasta (which is basically Mac and cheese)...it's was ok-I think I can make better at home.  I had the cookhouse wrap & it was a little disappointing...I took a couple bites, but it was a lot of lettuce and I had to look for the meat...I think they forgot to put the bacon, ham, and turkey in it?!?! I ended up fining a few chopped up pieces, but it's very few.  The broccoli salad was a hit-very fresh tasting. I wish there was a way to give 3 1/2 stars b/c 2 out of the 4 items we had were delicious, the others were meh.  I would go again, just wouldn't be making any special trips.",

    "text": "Awesome! Stopped in for a work lunch & the Urban Cowboy sandwich did not disappoint. The emphasis on fresh ingredients & how the food was prepared was what brought us there. The tenderness & flavor of the meat cooked on the Big Green Egg was incredible & everyone at our table was very pleased with their selections. Service was great & loved the feel of the restaurant along with the outside dining which is where we enjoyed our meal. Been back for lunch & dinner several times and whether the Greens (you've got to try the Pepper Patch w/lime marinated steak), the Wood Fired Shrimp Kabobs, or the Pork Tacos (I think that was a daily special) they did not disappoint! Was so pleased with everything I had to try the Half Baked Cookie, oh yea, it's as good as it sounds and loved how it was served in its own mini cast iron skillet. Going to try the Take It To the House option next for a gathering we are having at home. Definitely would recommend giving this one a try.",

    "text": "Tried this place yesterday. Always up for trying something new. Was not impressed and I'm pretty easy to please. The food is just ok. With so many choices surrounding this restaurant, they need to bring their A game. The menu online seemed fun and well thought out. I ordered the marinated steak sandwich. Tasted good, but very sloppy presentation, steak was about 3/4\" thick and there were barely any ingredients on the sandwich. This is a small but crucial detail...slice the steak very thinly and stack it so a human can bite into it. The roll was mushy and damp (use a heartier roll!). Had to eat with fork and knife. The fruit salad I ordered as the side was not appetizing looking at all. Mostly just apples and some pieces of shredded orange. Where is the attention to quality? Lastly, we went up to get more water and heard the clerk say to all placing an order that there was a 30 minute wait for food. For a counter service place, that's unacceptable. Our food took about 25 minutes for one quesadilla and the steak sandwich. The lady taking orders was not a good front of house person. Either she was frazzled or just not suited to the position. Don't assume people don't want their receipt and briskly move onto the next in line. Ask. And say \"thank you\", not \"you're all set\". The servers however were fabulous and knew folks were getting impatient.",
