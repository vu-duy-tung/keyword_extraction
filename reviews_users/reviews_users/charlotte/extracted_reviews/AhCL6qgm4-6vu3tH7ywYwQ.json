We were given excuse after excuse, an hour later we received our meal. We told the waitress to put it in a to go box as we were so upset. If I was one to walk out on a place I would have. The re was no apology, no comp, nothing. The food was mediocre. We will never eat dinner there again. A meal that should of taken no longer than 20 minutes max. If I could go lower than a 1 star on service, I would. And you wonder why a business goes under.",

They had all kinds of home cooked meals on the menu. I got the Phat Daddy burger (recommended by the server). Double patty w/ cheese, lettuce & tomato & a side of onion rings. Fresh and filling. One particular thing I liked about the assembly of the burger; the lettuce & tomato were fresh & cold while the patties were steaming hot (nothing worse than limp lettuce). The onion rings were pretty good but I've had better. The batter was a little thick. My wife got the BLT which she really enjoyed. They offer plenty of sides to choose from too. This place is also very affordable. Two for lunch, under $15 bucks. Not too shabby. Yes, I'll be back.",

I knew these folks when they worked at Cafe 6100 in the Southpark area, and now they own their own place.  The Phat Daddy burger is huge, flavorful and puts Five Guys to shame.  The pork chops are a specialty, along with the best mac 'n cheese in town.  The cobbler is to die for, and as we've found by visiting on different days, changes daily.  Bottom line is that it's not crowded (at least not yet) and the food is fresh and yummy.  The staff is friendly too!!.  It's hidden away in a small strip center, so it's easy to miss, so slow down when you are near Stallings and Old Monroe Road, or you'll miss it, and some great food too.  Two thumbs, way up!  Kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesdays with adult purchase of $5.00 up.  Tell them Rob sent ya!!",

I had their meatloaf and I have to say that there isn't many places that I have enjoyed their meatloaf but this one was as good as I have had. The wife had their fried chicken tenders and I got to sample them as well. WOW! I cannot say enough about the flavors of the seasoning and the only drawback is the fact that they do not yet offer fried chicken on the menu. They will they assured me as I am going to hold them to it and they better bread that chicken the same way they do the tenders because they were out of this world. I saw a gentleman sitting net to us in a booth that had a cheeseburger that looked very appealing and overheard just how pleased he was with it and how the flavor was so good. I might have to attack one or two of those my next visit which I hope is very soon.",

There was tables and booths, we got a booth and our server \"Sincer\" was attentive. Food was good, and I liked that you can mix and match and there is a lot of options. Great pricing too.

The service has been exemplary each time (we've been there 3 times now, and had the same super-nice and attentive waiter every time.) It's also very kid-friendly, which is good for families, and kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesday lunch and dinner.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food is a *touch* on the greasy side, so I always seem to find myself feeling it later. Obviously that doesn't bother me too much, though, given that I've been there 3 times in about 3 weeks... but I would just give fair warning that this isn't health food.",

    "text": "I saw another review on here that this place is hit or miss...for us it was a definite miss!! We were in the Matthews area for an appointment and thought we would stop by here to grab a bite to eat...now I wish we had gone elsewhere. When you walk in, there is no sign to seat yourself so you stand around awkwardly until someone walking by tells you to find a table. After we sat down, a server came up and took our food and drink order...that was the last time we ever saw our server on the floor until we got our check. Someone else brought our food and they had forgotten part of my order. When we told her that I was missing my toast, there was no response, she just walked into the back nonchalantly. We had no idea if she had heard us because of her lack of acknowledgement. Five minutes later, my toast came out, so apparently she had heard me. The food itself was mediocre...nothing to write home about but about what we were expecting. However, when we needed drink refills, neither our server nor the food runner were anywhere to be found. The restaurant had one saving grace...one server who was running his butt off serving almost all of the tables. He saw that we needed a refill and even though our table was not his, he stopped what he was doing and refilled the drink. He is the sole reason this review is two stars and not one. Before we got our check, I had to use the restroom...to get to there, you have to walk through the back, which brings you past what I can only assume is their freezer. I felt like I was walking through someone's basement. The bathroom itself felt like one of those gas station bathrooms where you stop at some remote gas station and they have to give you a key to use the facilities. I went back to the table afterwards and we sat around for a few minutes before our original server finally came back out and almost seemed surprised that we were ready to leave and wanted our check. Upon checking out, we wanted to leave two tips...one for our server (even though she literally only wrote down our order and gave us our check) and one for the server who gave us our refill when he was already busy with every other table in the restaurant. We wanted to let him know that we appreciated and acknowledged his hard work when everyone else was moving in slow motion (or had completely disappeared). The lady at the register acted like she was appalled and irritated that we would do that. She told us that our first server went on break and that's why we didn't see her. Not our problem! If she needed a break, then she shouldn't have taken our table. If we are ever in the Matthews area again, we will *not* be back, and I would never recommend this place to anyone.",

I've eaten mostly off of their lunch menu which has included, grilled chicken pitas, various salads including egg salad and burgers.   Their food is flavorless but I've consistently ordered from there in a pinch since it's so close to work. However, due to the complete rudeness of the staff I will no longer be dining from Phat Daddys. Upon this last encounter, I was treated like the biggest inconvenience when I arrived to pick up my order (this has been a common complaint among my coworkers but I've never directly experienced it). I was ready with card in hand to pay as I am aware that noon is an  exceptionally busy time for any restaurant. Not only did I get an eye roll from the waitress but a snotty reply to the most basic of responses. This was the last straw. If the food was better then I might tolerate it but, honestly, there aren't any redeeming qualities for me except for the location.     It also didn't help that the Pita I ordered was stale and the Chef Salad had an off taste to it.       I guess The Friendly Moose down the street will receive our business from now on.",

I ordered the western omelette with grits and a biscuit. The omelette was good but the fresh, fluffy warm biscuit was amazing and that's coming from someone who doesn't like biscuits. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The decor is a little run down and dark. Overall, an ok experience.",

When you walk in you can tell that the food will be good and that they have a regular crowd, a little older crowd but a good crowd.   The food was amazing! I loved my biscuits and gravy and my chocolate chip pancakes. And everyone else loved their food as well. The server was great and made sure the food came as ordered. They are very nice about making sure you can substitute things if needed, I always ask because I don't eat pork and that is sometimes hard at a breakfast restaurant.   I am taking one start away because even though they warn you with a little sign, it took forever for the food to come out! When it did finally come out it was hot and what I ordered, which is a good thing.   I highly recommend this place but you need to have a little bit of time on your hands...",

The actual waitress came and was very kind even though she messed up my order. We ordered the philly and the burger. Burger was squished flat as paper, burnt, and zero flavor. The philly had no flavor and there was something grissly in one of the bites. I guess you get what you paid for. We will never be back and if someone asks me I will tell them to starve rather than eat there.",

Don't be thrown off or intimidated by it's overly eye-roll worthy name, the cafe itself is a homey place you can bring your parents too for Sunday afternoon brunch.  My son and I crushed some breakfast here the other day and were happy with the service, the food, and the cleanliness of the establishment.  It's definitely not a show-stopper type place, but to be fair, it's really not trying to be.  The real standout is the value.

My most recent visit was mid May and I came here to get lunch with a friend. It was pretty busy since it was lunch time but we were still able to find somewhere to seat ourselves. She ordered a steak with green beans and I decided to go with chicken strips with banana pudding and fried okra as my two sides. I'm not exactly sure if the menu specified what sort of steak it was but when my friend realized it was a Salisbury steak, she was very disappointed. She also said the green beans were definitely canned. My chicken strips were tasteless. Ranch came to the rescue but I had to practically drown my chicken in the sauce. The fried okra was crunchy and you can taste the okra but it didn't taste like they seasoned it at all. Then came the banana pudding.. I had high hopes and they were crushed. It actually took a long time for it to come out and ended up tasting store bought.   Our waiter did a good job at being attentive. He made sure our drinks stayed full and asked us about the food often. It wasn't his fault that the food was disappointing and we didn't want to be that customer to complain so we didn't. But I most likely will not be coming here again.",
