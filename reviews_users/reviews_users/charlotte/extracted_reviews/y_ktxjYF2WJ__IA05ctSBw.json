I love the pork BBQ, cole slaw has a weird taste, my baked sweet potato last time was burned, they shouldn't have served it, baked beans are good, fries ok, cornbread is really not cornbready at all, but good taste, garlic bread was kinda soggy. We did take-out and they totally forgot one of our sides!!! I'm not driving back to get it either cause it was another cole slaw and it's not even that good. But I will call to let them know they should double check their orders!  Overpriced for the overall quality of food, but I like their pork BBQ, and I may go back for just that, but wouldn't really recommend someone eat there.",

The sliced pork & chicken were good - not slathered in bbq sauce.   Sides were beans (too much bbq flavor for me), ear of corn, & cole slaw (good, not too much mayo).  Cornbread muffin was good, but the garlic toast looked like a piece of old French toast - soggy, not crisp.    The salad bar was somewhat small - only iceberg lettuce & some spinach.  Ok, for an add-on, but not sufficient for a meal.",

The beef \"brisket\" was a flavorless pot roast and tasted like it had been cooked in a crock pot or boiled. Seriously. The mac & cheese had no flavor and tasted like hospital food. Golden Corral's version is better and I am NOT a fan of them at all. The cornbread had a good flavor but was too heavy and undercooked. The dry rubbed wings were fried The outside was crispy and flavor was decent but they were EXTREMELY fatty and that grossed me out. The only good thing was our soda from the fountain. Don't waste your money here. Go to Mac's Speedshop (LOVE THEM) Their wings are to die for!!",

Also the pulled pork was very greasy. Almost waxy. I'm sure the waxy parts could be attributed to temperature (cold!).  The salad bar has decent, sometimes odd, options, but there were things like egg salad dropped into cottage cheese and some pink marshmallow fluff? Not really appetizing.  Don't get the cornbread. It was a cold, gross tasting brick that was raw in the middle.  The fried okra appetizer is the size of a single side serving.  Anyway. The service was spotty. We asked for refills and they brought us the wrong drinks in to-go cups. No one seemed to notice the obviousness of our dissatisfaction. Full plates, yet signing the check.......  Our server was nice enough but it was just not worth spending money on ever again.",

The lady who took the order was very nice even though she had not worked at this particular store before.  My irritation with this restaurant is they had signs everywhere they were  \"introducing\" their new fried pickles of which I am a huge fan of and I ordered one serving for $4.99 to go.  When I got home, there was not even ONE pickles worth of slices and it was a very small pickle.  They were tasteless and the little coating was practically raw cornmeal that had slid off the pickle.  Instead of putting it in a take out box with holes to let out the steam, it was in a piece of like waxed paper and twisted shut.  Pickles are normally served with something like ranch dressing.  Not BBQ sauce. YUCK!  If you are promoting something you better KNOW HOW TO COOK IT!  Fried pickles should be golden BROWN and the cornmeal should have some salt and paprika or cayenne pepper.  I will never order these again.  Doesn't anyone ever taste the damn food they are \"promoting\"? What a shame.",

    "text": "Came here with some family for Father's Day, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Started out with the Redneck Egg Rolls, which are pulled pork, cole slaw, and a little jack cheese. The proportions of meat to slaw to cheese were just right, with the pork dominating the majority of the roll, with just enough slaw and cheese to provide some crispness and creaminess. They were fried well and not greasy at all, served with a spicy ranch for dipping. The sauce was pretty good, but honestly they didn't need it. Would definitely get them again.  For the entree, I went with the Brisket version of the Big Deal combo, which is a sandwich, side, and drink. I got mine on garlic bread with fries. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut fries as long as they're not soggy or greasy, and these were done just right. Sonny's garlic bread is always a winner for me as well, just crisp enough, while still being soft with a little chew in the center. The brisket was tender, flavorful, and juicy, and I recommend it highly.  The service was generally good, but had one or two hiccups. They forgot to bring out my brother-in-law's fries at first, but were quick to bring him out some fresh ones after we pointed it out. There was also a decently long wait to get refills on our drinks at times, but it wasn't a deal-breaker.  My sister ordered a chopped brisket plate with mac n' cheese and baked beans as her sides, and didn't really care for either of them. Based on past experiences, I'd tend to agree with her, they are decent but really just mediocre.",

I've never had a Cowboy egg roll before (pork, coleslaw in a deep friend egg roll) and it was pretty darn good even without the \"smoky\" ranch sauce.  I thought the brisket was very flavorful but a little on the dry side.  Speaking on things overcooked - the corn on the cob was like baby food.  I actually asked the girl for more cornbread (which is perfectly cooked) in substution of the cob.  I'm pretty sure that sat around in simmering water for waaaay too long. Mac n cheez, green beans - all southern style.   3 (or was it 4?) different BBQ sauces - I personally enjoyed the smoky sweet.",

They barely had any meat on them. And the meat was crunchy, I couldn't tell what part was the meat and what was the bone. The smoked wings were only okay, but nothing to bang home about. I got baked beans and potato salad with cornbread as sides and these were only okay as well. Nothing stood out and I paid $14 for everything. I would not recommend what I got at all.

I was very excited when my Wife and I moved to Charlotte 19 years ago, that there were multiple Sonny's  locations. I live within 5 minutes of the Arboretum location, which opened several years ago.   Now I have to say that I LOVE Barbecue, I have eaten Barbecue all over North Carolina (Eastern and Western), Georgia, Florida, Tennessee (Memphis), and Texas. Now I know this may hurt some feelings but North Carolina Whole Hog Style Chopped BBQ w/either Tomato Based, or Vinegar based sauce's are on the BOTTOM of my list. Memphis style Baby Back Ribs are hard to beat, and well as Texas Beef Brisket, and Sausage putting them at the TOP. BBQ is serious business in the South. So now you know where I stand.  The great thing about Sonny's locations, is consistency, and they aren't tied to a regional type of Barbecue, and they aren't trying to re-invent the wheel. The make GREAT Beef Brisket, GREAT Baby Back Ribs, GREAT Barbecue Chicken, and Great Barbecue Pork, and Smoked Turkey. You can have meats sliced or chopped, and they have MANY different sauces available. Some of the meat is so good, I wouldn't pervert it with sauce.   Another thing I LOVE about Sonny's is the BBQ Baked Beans, the Cole Slaw (sweet, and fresh) and their Garlic Bread. And if you like Sweet Tea, theirs is hard to beat.   The Arboretum Sonny's staff is nice and knowledgeable,  the restaurant is always clean, and the prices are always fair. I eat in the restaurant, and buy take out, and they haven't messed up an order yet.   If you are a TRUE Barbecue Fan, you will love Sonny's. Don't let any Butthurt North Carolina Mutts tell you any different. :-)",

All three of us had the pulled pork lunch special.   I love it that they serve lunch specials until 4 daily.   So many restaurants only do 11-2 and/or only weekdays.   Their cornbread is SO yummy.   Among us,  we had a wide variety of sides:  baked potato,  corn on the cob,  macaroni and cheese,  cole slaw,  and baked sweet potato--and all of them were great!   The pulled pork was extremely lean,  and I love their selection of BBQ sauces.   Will definitely eat here again when visiting daughter.",

Not that I went there daily, but it had been an Arboretum staple for me ever since I moved to Charlotte way back in the day.   Pleasantly surprised that in its place was a Sonny's.  Yes, it's a chain that spans over a couple states, but I've never really had any issue with the fact - I know some BBQ purists are rolling over in their graves as I type this review, but there is a reason why there are so many Sonny's locations.  Don't come here semi-hungry!  There is a lot of food to be eaten at this place.  I opted for the special (on a Tuesday night) for the all you can eat ribs.  The first batch were a little tough, but the 2nd batch fell right off the bone.  There are a plethora of sides (or on the menu:  \"Side-kicks\") to choose from, I went with the corn on the cob and the mac and cheese.  Needless-to-say... my fingers and mouth area were totally covered in sauces by the time I was done.  Since this location is brand-spanking new, the dining area is super clean and the tables are very shiny.  It was like a high end country saloon with a nice bar in the middle of it.  Because of the shape of the space, there are other little dining room nooks where tables were, but we opted for the high top near the bar.  Would I go out of my way to go to this restaurant?  Maybe not, but it's a good option whenever I am in the area.",

    "text": "I'm from Texas, and my friends here in Charlotte wanted me to try some BBQ (even if it was a chain). When we got there they weren't able to find a spot for our party of 6 (and a baby), so the host sat us at different booths.  Before we could even order or sit down, the manager came right away and sat us at a round table that fit us all. They were very nice to us and were apologetic.  I could tell they wanted to give us quality service.  Our server was Josh, and he was very professional and kind.  He got to us right away and took our drink orders.  He didn't make us feel rushed to order right away and even interacted with us being from Texas.  So customer service here from my experience is a 5 star rating!   The bbq- I like the menu options.  I ordered the sweet and smokey ribs with mac and cheese, coleslaw, and garlic bread.  The ribs were good for this being a chain bbq place.  I wouldn't say they were moist, but they weren't chewy either. They were just simple and good. The mac and cheese was very creamy in texture and cheesy. I like their coleslaw, it wasn't over tart. Garlic bread reminded me of Texas toast, so that was a plus for me! Overall I'd give quality do the food a 4/5. But mainly because I've had legit southern BBQ and it is more rich in flavor and soft in texture.",

I was in town for a while and my parents brought me here during my stay. The food was pretty good, our fries were a little cold when they arrived, but otherwise it was enjoyable. I got a pick 2 combo deal they were running for $10.99 and opted to add a salad bar for $2.99. I definitely got my money's worth in food.  The service is a little hit or miss at this location. Our waitress was very nice, but she would disappear for periods and we would need drinks or reorders and could not find her. I'm normally sympathetic because I worked as a waitress for years, but it was dead for a Friday night and there were plenty of servers on.  If you're looking for a decent meal while at the arboretum, it's a solid option.",

Maybe I looked like I'd been here before but I told her in two different trips to give me a minute to look the menu over.   My food (BBQ ribs ) was served on a pizza tray!   Not sure how that is even possible to eat your dinner on a pizza tray.  My knife kept cutting through the thin paper that separated my food from the metal tray.   Finally the hyper waitress brought me the check while I was still eating.  Basically that tells me there's nothing more for me .... she's done whether I was or not.  I have to admit I find that rude for the check to be left before I am done eating.  The food was meh... dry .,, but the experience sorta ruined the dinner for me.",

I have such fond memories of coming to Sonny's as a kid and eating the delicious salad bar. I was very disappointed in my experience here. We came on a Sunday night around 7pm and the whole place was dead, there were maybe 10 other patrons in the whole restaurant. The service was good, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I ordered pulled pork and my husband got the chicken dinner. We waited 25 minutes for our food, and when it finally came out everything was cold! My pulled pork and beans had a good flavor, but I couldn't handle that it was cold so I asked our server to pop it in the microwave. He brought it back 5 minutes later, and you could tell that's exactly what he did. The corn was the only really good and hot thing. Barbecue bottles were really sticky but mostly everything else was clean. I knew I shouldn't of eaten the food, because I got incredibly sick that night and couldn't stop throwing up. I'm not blaming the restaurant for that, since I'm pregnant, but I'm not sure the food had been stored and heated up properly so I was definitely concerned. I probably wouldn't come here again, overall I left unsatisfied and queasy.",

The same young man put me on hold only to have someone named Brandon answer the phone to say the manager is extremely busy in the back and can't talk to me and to leave a message. I stated I would hold, and Brandon proceeded to hang up on me. I called back, Brandon answered again and miraculously was able to get the \"oh so busy\" manager Alvin to the phone. Alvin did not seem at all concerned about the fact that two of his employees felt it would be amusing to play on the phone with customers as opposed to doing the job in which they were hired to do.

I ordered an appetizer, the Redneck Egg Rolls. They were fantastic! Richie said he eats them every other day, I believe it because they are great! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Everything was perfect. I will return for sure",
