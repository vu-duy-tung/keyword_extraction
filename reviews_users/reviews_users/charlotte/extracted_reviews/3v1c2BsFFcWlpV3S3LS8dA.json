The food is good, not fantastic let's face it.  I'd recommend the General's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and the Pork w Garlic Sauce.  I'd also stay away from the Sweet and Sour stuff - they mix it in for you, so you can't control the sauce to meat ration - bleh.  It's not the best Chinese food I've eaten, but then again, I've eaten a bunch of meals in China.  I would however come back and will continue to frequent the place.",

I am picky and like to leave out certain vegetables or change the sauce or alter the spiciness.  I have been able to do so and pleased with the outcome every single time.  In the hundred or so times I have been to Taipei Express (no joke) I have never had a bad experience.   I wish there was room for them to expand and build an addition, but there isn't.  Also, parking is hard to come by.  I always park in the next door lot, even though it says office parking only.  To date I've never been towed.  Also, little know secret, there is parking directly behind the building...but only about four extra spaces.    All in all, I am in love with Taipei Express.  MMM!",

But then I was introduced to Taipei Express by some friends with more CLT experience, and really, I haven't found a better quick dine-in/carry-out place better. I mean Fortune Cookie was OK because it's cheaper, but paying a little extra really pays off at TE.  They give you huge portions, enough for a dinner and a following lunch. The appetizers and soups are all outstanding. Any kind of the chicken specialties are winners, but what really impresses me is any dish with shrimp or scallops on the spicy side. They give you a lot  of tasty pieces, and I also love the option of getting brown rice on the side instead.  Their dinners will cost just about $8-10, and if you're sharing, even less. That makes their heaping lunch specials super awesome.  I like the Taiwanese-Northern Chinese style of cuisine, and this comes through. Only thing is, it's got a really small dining area and an even smaller parking lot out front. So it's best for a lunch run from the office or a quick grab of a big meal on the way home from work.",

You can't help but notice how shiny and clean the kitchen is when you walk in- sparkly stainless steel from floor to ceiling.  A row of men in while aprons tossing food in & out of pans...fire flashing up, big woks spinning around... but that's not even the stellar part...  the truly stellar part is that in all those years, ordering at least once or twice a month, they have never ever gotten my order wrong...  not one time.  These people have an attention to detail that is to be admired.  We discuss it everytime we order from there.   You can eat in there dining area, but it's small and the seating is not at all made to linger in, so we think it best to call ahead and take it home.  The food comes in these fantastic black plastic containers that do not spill or leak.  I really appreciate their thoughfulness in provinding above average to-go containers.  It's a huge portion of piping hot chinesey goodness, no matter what you order!  The rice comes seperate, white or brown.  Their egg rolls are yummy as are the crab rangoons.   They're only a dollar or so more than fast food, and it's usually enough to allow for left overs  :-)  It's not flashy, and there are no koi ponds or paper lanterns, but it's solid, reliable, enjoyable chinese food.",

The Sesame Chicken was juicy and the sauce was sweet and tangy.  I did not eat too much of the browned rice, but the chicken wings were crunchy, salty, meaty and tasty, especially with a splash of mustard and duck sauce.  The dumplings were massive, the biggest I've ever seen.  They were a little doughy, but the pork inside was nicely seasoned, and the sauce was delicious.    The orders were large as well.  I ate my fill last night, and still had enough Lo Mien left to have a nice sized lunch today.  For the money I'd say Taipei Express is a great deal, True its not gourmet, but it is good... the portions are large and the prices are reasonable.  I have to disagree with Jason L. on this one and give Taipei Express a thumbs up, try it for yourself, and let us know what you think.",

You can dine inside but it is casual and with counter service. The food is great - my favorite is the steamed dumplings and spicy sa cha chicken. It is an open, very clean kitchen that you can see. Service is fast and they have never once messed up my take out order.

The only \"downside\" is the fried rice...just a little too bland for my liking.   Most of their business is take out though they do have a small seating area you can eat in at. The parking lot is very tiny and can be dicey getting out of because it's right on Providence. The owners are always working and very friendly.

Not only is their food delicious, consistent, and ready in less than 10 minutes but they're so nice to every customer. They definitely know me by my first name, and always ask how my sister is doing! I recommend their crab rangoons (so delicious), their honey walnut chicken (sub cashews for walnuts) or their crispy scallion chicken, extra crispy with white meat. Definitely give them a try!",

I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, and I must say to my surprise, it tasted amazing, if not better than P.F. Chang's! Definitely not your typical \"carryout Chinese food\". The size of the portions are very generous, and I could only eat half of the plate, which meant great leftovers.  The staff was really nice, and I noticed that the dining space was very well maintained. The restaurant was very clean with comfortable seating areas unlike other Chinese restaurants.   It's definitely worth ones time to stop by.",

It is inexpensive and very tasty. Be warned, I ate here so much that I put on about 10 pounds over the course of 6 months. You can either order in or take out. It does get very crowded during the lunch time and is usually quite quiet during dinner. The owner is very friendly. If you ask not to have an eggroll included with your lunch, they will give you an extra scoop of rice at no charge.  There are a number of people who give this place a bad review. My question to them is what the heck? Where else in Charlotte have you found better Chinese food for under 10 bucks? I have been to this place probably 40 or 50 times. I have never seen any variation in their quality of food. I have also purchased food for my entire family and for parties here. Everyone was extremely happy with the food.",

After, I was recommended this place by friends so I thought, I need to give this place a try. The staff is super friendly & haven't had an issue with any visit. You can really tell that this restaurant has their regulars & the staff has made an effort to get to know their more frequent customers. The actual restaurant is pretty small and the parking in front is a little difficult I always see people park next door & walk over. It was a Friday night that I went & it was extremely busy with takeout orders. I ordered the Sa-cha beef spicy with white rice & an order of chicken wings (6). You get the option to alter the spice as well as choose between white, brown or fried rice which I think is pretty awesome for a Chinese restaurant. The prices of the food are a little bit more expensive than the usual but as compared to others, for the quality & amount of food you get it's worth it. The dinner portions are able to feed 2-3 people. I've really enjoyed my food every time I come here and will continue doing so.",

And I was charged $.50 extra just to add onions...what descent Lo Mein dish comes without Onions???!!! SMH. The egg roll was dry and tasteless, the Scallion Chicken had a good taste, love the skinny Lo Mein noodles, but not enough veggies in it.  The soup was Very Tasteless...sad face! I had to ask them to add the green onions to it.   Might possibly go back if I'm dying for sum Chinese around lunch time. Perhaps I'll try something in Garlic Sauce. Stay tuned...",

They are a model of efficiency and consistency, even of the food blends in with pretty much every other Chinese take-out you've ever had.  So the secret deal here is their vegetable soup- just a buck fifty and you get a huge contained stuffed with fresh veggies and plenty of tofu.  Even if you don't like tofu, take it our and enjoy the extra hot broth with the veggies.  Always a good starter.  Everything else here is pretty much what you know of Americanized Chinese take-out: choose your protein, choose your sauce, and let the good times roll in mediocrity.  Nothing too spicy, nothing overly flavorful, but the brown sauce is what it is and it is always what you've tasted before, so at least there are no surprises there  You'll notice most of their business is take out, though they do have a small dine in seating area you can use as well. Downgrade on the parking lot: is very tiny and can be dicey getting out of because it's directly on Providence. Still, a good go-to when you need food quick and don't want to both making these things yourself.",

I hate spring rolls and the flaky thin outer shell.  Boo.  The lo mein, although a large portion, was somewhat tasteless.  They have chili oil that is bland, so it didn't help.    That being said: $10.75...for poor tasting noodles and a spring roll that I didn't even want.  Yuck. Now I'm hungry still.",

They just have a great selection (vegans and vegetarians--do a happy dance) and it is always done well for takeout Chinese. I never eat in, always takeout. My favorite is the black bean tofu with brown rice and the vegetarian steamed dumplings...oh my GOSH....those are my obsession. I can eat the entire appetizer on my own. ADDICTING.  This cannot be an in depth review because my extent of experience is takeout...however... all you need to take away from this is the following: Great food in the Chinese takeout world! Fast service! Sweet staff! Addicting dumplings!!!!! Central location for many neighborhoods to quickly get to! Always answers your calls quickly and efficiently! Addicting dumplings.... oh wait.... ;)",

What is better than a cold night with Chinese take away and netflix? Nothing.   So far in Charlotte I have been utterly disappointed with the Chinese options, Americanized or otherwise. Read that this place had decent reviews and figured I would give it a go. Ordered Orange Chicken with Fried Rice and Hot and Sour Soup. The Orange Chicken was what you would expect from an Americanized takeout place - the meat quality was good which is a plus because sometimes places skimp on that. The chao fan was decent too, but the hot and sour soup surprisingly had pork in it. Not a big deal as I am clearly not vegetarian, but I feel like they should disclose this as Hot and Sour soup is typically vegetarian.   The staff were friendly, but seemed to judge me pretty hard for busting out my Chinese. Hey I like to practice as much as I can and if that means ordering Americanized sesame chicken and spring rolls in Chinese then so be it. At least I tried.   I'll be back to try out other things, but probably at lunch time for half the price.",

I'm puzzled why it has only four stars. We sampled the Mongolian Beef and the Chinese Vegetable entree. We were surprised at the quickness of our food delivered to the table. We we opened our covers, I knew we were at the right place. The beef was well-seasoned along with green onions. The sauce was perfectly balanced within the dish.  The Chinese vegetables were bright and fresh. Cooked just right, we ate the dish with delight.  This is a five-star establishment. Go and see for yourself.",

There were tickets everywhere on the line. The workers just kept cranking out food and to go orders. They tell you ten minutes, and it'll be ten minutes. The ladies at the register are always really nice.   I always get egg drop soup. It's a must for me at every Chinese restaurant. I like the lo mein here because they put better veggies in it than other places. You know what I mean? Some restaurants use kind of like filler vegetables. I like the quality they do for the noodles here. My entree choice is usually different depending on my mood. My food is always still piping hot and steaming when I get it back home.   The parking is not great. They have a pretty small lot. I always park next door if the other businesses are closed. I'm not sure what the rules are here.

    "text": "Taipei is the tiny shop on Providence near the confusing Providence, Queens catastrophe of an intersection.  It is a small place with an even smaller parking lot.  You are better off getting your food to go because of the limited seating and tendency of the restaurant to get overly hot from the kitchen equipment only feet away.  I found the food to be decent, but nothing over the top.  The restaurant wasn't particularly clean during my visit either.  The bathroom was unkept, the trash was overflowing, flies flew about, and an employee sat in the corner occupying one of the few tables, and two additional employees sat outside of the entrance; one, cigarette in mouth.  Trying new food is fun, but I like to have some idea of what I am eating.  The menu doesn't offer much in the way of English translation, so if you aren't familiar with the dishes, you are left in the dark.  In my opinion, the pricing was a bit much for Chinese takeout as well.  It's safe to say that Taipei was likely a one and done for me.  At least I can say that I've tried it.  On the upside, it is convenient to both Elizabeth and Myers Park residents looking to scratch their Chinese food itch.",

Sweet tea was pure sugar.   When I tried to exchange my orange chicken for something else due to poor quality, they told me that was not possible.  This is a first for me.

The chicken wings are pretty great too, crispy but not greasy...   Ingredients are always fresh, and the portions are very generous.

They have some tables outside and a good amount of tables inside as well,  so if you want to eat there,  that's a good option.  Probably a great option for the summer.    Ordered wonton soup,  egg drop soup,  crab Rangoon,  chicken and string beans in garlic sauce and shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce.    We really liked everything.  Mainly really liked the soups. They came with some freshly made crispy wontons which we appreciated. Also,  they make hot oil just the way we like it. Finally,  we really enjoyed the way they cooked the veggies.  They weren't wilted or overcooked by the time we got home even though they spent am additional 15 minutes in the car getting cooked.   Would definitely return.  Probably the best Chinese take out we've had here in Charlotte.  Curious to come back and try their fried rice and lomein. Will also try to eat in as driving 15 minutes back home to eat takes a toll on food.   Thanks for the good experience!",

I lived in Brooklyn and well, what they say about NYC Chinese food is very True: there's nothing like it. A majority of the places I've been to here have been overrated and bland, as well as expensive. I ordered the Sesame chicken, dinner combo and it was enough for lunch the next day.   I like my sesame chicken with a bit of a crunch and it was spot on! The sauce was tangy and it wasn't drowning in sesame seeds which is always a plus. The fried rice was just that fried rice. No veggies really and I have to say as it may be authentic to make it that way, it still lacked flavor. I had to add soy sauce and duck sauce to the rice, hence the missing one star. Will that stop me from visiting? Of course not, I'll just order a protein based fried rice next time.   All in all, two thumbs up over here!",

They try hard to achieve the accuracy of your order by repeating it back to you sometimes inquiring to make sure they get your order right. The crispy scallion chicken is actually crispy even to go! The quality of food is really impressive to be mostly takeout. I am Picky! I appreciate people who work hard and CARE about their customers. Therefore, I will go out of my way to give them my business!",

    "text": "LOVE Taipei express! For sure my favorite Chinese takeout place in Charlotte. I would be here more often but given that I live in South Charlotte I am unable to make it here as often as I would like. I've been coming here for years and it's always very good. I'm boring and get the same order every time. I get the sesame chicken with fried rice and an order of spicy broccoli with garlic sauce. The broccoli with the garlic sauce is the best I've had in Charlotte. It's always spot on and just spicy enough. They make the food quickly and don't have you waiting too long. Heads up - Parking can be an issue and it's always tricky getting out of their lot.",

    "text": "Stopped in here to satisfy a Chinese craving and yelp recommended. Honestly, I think it might go under as one of my top three Americanized Chinese spots in Charlotte. I did take-out, I did not eat at the restaurant itself.   I went with the chicken in garlic sauce with white rice, and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of chicken and vegetables I received. It was a very large and well balanced portion. The sauce itself was very flavorful, but not overpowering. It was certainly a dish that I would order again.   I also got the dumplings (fried). They were a little heavy on the ginger, but it didn't take away from the overall dumpling taste, which was tasty. It also was a good blend of meat to dough, rather than the usually over doughy dumplings you find at Chinese restaurants.  I wouldn't recommend the hot and sour soup though. I love this soup, and this one was a clear miss in my book. It wasn't bad, it just lacked the flavor and bite I was hoping to get from a traditional hot and sour soup.   Overall, I will be back again, and can't wait to try some of their other menu options.",

But let's get back to this review! This place blew my mind! It's a very small place. Not a lot of tables. It was about 1 hour before closing when my husband and I decided to stop in and try it out. The girl at the counter was super friendly! She gave us all the time in the world to look over the menu and she gladly answered any questions we had. My husband had the \"Four Happiness\" and I had the \"Beef Lo Mein\". It was all very tasty! Our dishes were flavorful and jam packed! I am very impressed by this place. You know that gross feeling you sometimes get after eating greasy Chinese food?? (Maybe it's just me lol)... this place wasn't like that at all! I left happy and not at all regretting ordering Chinese for dinner. We will definitely be back!",

The chicken definitely stuck out to me, not your mushy greasy chicken I've seen at some places. The everything was awesome and I definitely agree that it is one of the best Chinese take out places in Charlotte.",
