I usually go to the Arboretum location but am excited there's a new location in Fort Mill (eventually I'll get there). My parents are Yankees that moved to LSU for college and they said it's at close as you can get in CLT. I've been to NOLA three times myself and agree. I usually get the crawfish etoufee, seafood gumbo or fried oysters. When they have blackened trout on special I get that. Their green bean almondine are the best green beans I've ever had. If you're feeling extra fat kid get the chocolate pecan pie. Servers are great and I love that it's the same crew since I started going here which usually is a good sign in how they treat their staff.",

How sweet it is to have them right down the road from us now, with plenty of convenient parking!  Don't recall our waitress's name, but she did a good job without being overbearing. We went before the dinner crowd and were seated immediately.   The fried green tomato appetizers were excellent; fresh, crisp and not greasy. I had blackened meatloaf, smashed potatoes, and collard greens. Wife had crab cake, smothered cabbage and mac/cheese. All was excellent, just the way I remembered from the Arboretum location, without the bumper to bumper traffic.  The beer selection was very good, although they had sold out of Dixie Blackened Voodoo. No problem though, as they had a number of very good local and national craft brews to choose from. They had a number of wines to choose from, but I don't know much about wine.   Ambience was pleasant for a strip mall restaurant which just opened a couple of weeks ago, but we didn't go for ambience, we went for a good, reasonably priced dinner. We were not disappointed.",

Well to start it off I was disappointed in the crab cake appetizer for one you get a regular size cake with a lot of breading for $7.75. For this price I was expecting more crab meat & less breading or even 2 cakes. We also order the Chicken Jambalaya it was ok. We had a lot of recommendations to get the Red beans & rice but we were very disappointed in them. I would take Popeyes over Cajun Yard Dog. The fried okra was very good & not over cooked. The catfish bites looked very good but tasted bland. For the quality of the food the prices are a little high. This was our first time trying this place. Because the customer service was good & the food wasn't horrible we will try the CYD again but order different foods & see if I can change my review.",

It was busy but no wait time for a seat when we arrived at 6:30pm. We had really good wait staff. Quay was attentive but not over-bearing. Our meals were very good. My husband and I decided to have gumbo which really was a hearty bowl of soup with mussels on the side as well as shrimp (large and small), chunks of chicken and was delish. We thought it would be a cup of soup so by time we consumed every drop we were full. Our meals were great as we did the pick 2 choices. We both had fried jumbo shrimp and I had crab cake while my husband had catfish. All was good. My husband wasn't a fan of the cole slaw. Wish we had room in our tummies for desert so Quay suggested we start with desert next time :) That's what I'm talking about ... good looking out. We do like to venture to other restaurants for different dining experiences & not because our failure to return is based on bad experience.   The only critique would be to develop a good cocktail menu with established options. We ordered created cocktails but found them to be OK and as such the 4 stars.   The team at this restaurant worked well together in providing good service. Location is very close to our home so revisiting in the future is a definite. Maybe 5 stars if the cocktails are on point and the food is consistent. Something to look out for with next visit....",

The dessert looked good, but did not want to hit $50 for, again, lunchtime.  Despite our server being over assigned to multiple tables, she did a pretty good job.

Had a slight mixup in one drink order, but they correctly it immediately.  Very pleased with our meals. Something struck us as strange, though.  As good as the food is, we did not see many customers at all on a beautiful Saturday evening.  Also, we both felt the staff was almost overly attentive (you don't see that these days!), as if they were trying too hard to please for some reason.  Maybe it's a fluke, but it struck us as unusual. Overall, great meal and service.",

The shrimp was over seasoned w the wrong seasonings. The grits were dry. The catfish was so thin and crispy but it wasn't filling just greasy. The sweet potato fries were good tho lol",

I was a little reluctant to try bc I'm not a huge Cajun fan, but glad we did.  Their specials have always been really good -- especially the pan fried trout with creole andouille and crawfish cream sauce.  They have good selection of fried platter options, including shrimp, oysters, and catfish and their app menu has some great options too.   The owner and staff are all super friendly and very eager to make sure your experience is a great one. We will be back!!",

What I got looked like tan gravy versus the real dark, rich Rox sauce I love. Lastly there was no Dixie land jazz music which I like to hear when I'm at a Cajun restaurant.

The hostess took our drink order immediately and brought over a drink menu when I asked about what specialty drinks they have. All of them were very reasonable priced ($9 or below). I ended up getting the Mardis Rita which was excellent. We ordered the Gumbo as a starter which could also be considered a side for the entrees. The gumbo was so good and some of the best I have had in the Charlotte area. For the entrees we ordered the Fried catfish and shrimp and crawfish etouffee. Both were amazing!! The only issue is the menu did not state you got catfish bites for the entree so it was assumed it would be a filet but it was still so delicious there was no reason to complain.  I will definitely become a regular here even if I just come in for a bowl of Gumbo. Can't wait to return!!",

I'm not saying that this place doesn't do their Cajun food homemade but it seems to me a lot of the stereotypical \"Cajun\" food taste a little to generic not like it was made from scratch.

The interior looks slightly different after they took some time to re-do it. I wouldn't consider it to be a sports bar anymore, more of a family restaurant. Even though they still have the flat screens from the previous bar, they are not open late like a sports bar.  They definitely disappoint on the food side of things. The waitress talked us into the catfish \"bites\" as an appetizer, as you can see in the photo - \"bites' is not an adequate description! You could definitely consider these a meal by themselves! They were tasty indeed.  I ordered the meatloaf with side of collards and red beans/rice. The meatloaf was very good! So huge I forced myself to stop eating half way or I would need to be rolled out to my truck! Jeez. My friend is a po-boy connoisseur and he came back with two deep fried thumbs up after chowing down on the shrimp pro-boy.  They do not offer draft beer, but they have a very small list of bottled beer including some Louisiana favorites. They bar can also assist in select liquor drinks.

Not only did I grow up in Charlotte, but I grew up in New Orleans too. So, I would call myself a Cajun food expert.   There aren't that many places in or around Charlotte that have Louisiana/New Orleans level Cajun food and I always considered CYD to be one of them. However, on this trip, I just wasn't impressed. Years ago, I would swear this was the best place in town, but not so much now. Not to mention the prices are a little on the high side. With the food competition cranking up, you have to have really great food to charge high prices.   It's always sad to see a restaurant you use to call the best not live up to its expectations, but it wasn't terrible either. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, it's just the food was decent and the prices were too high.   I'll save my next Cajun food craving for when I'm in New Orleans.",

They have plain wood chairs and older style tables. Feels like a 60's diner or that old family restaurant that you never liked as a kid. We ordered 2 margarita's and I didn't care for them. Seemed to have little Tequila and the flavor tasted more like orange juice than Margarita. Perhaps they make their own mix, because they had several specialty ones. Probably my mistake to not have ordered the speciality. For an appetizer we had Calamari Okrachokie. It was tasty. Some fried Calamari, Fried Okra, and Fried Artichokes. I mean, fry anything and it's good right? I had Shrimp Ettoufee and it was tasty, pretty spicy. My wife had blackened Salmon, she said was good. My daughter got Fried Chicken, which was very good. My other daughter got a swordfish and fried shrimp, again good.  So, if you want some Cajun style food this isn't a bad place. However, don't go here for the atmosphere. It has a mix of old diner and sports bar feel to it.",

The collards were chopped and not that great.  Btw the okra was awesome.  Good service but the food .....ok",

    "text": "I was very interested in visiting CYD (Cajun Yard Dog) simply because Madison's was gone and they're new. Which is great for this area! I ordered the deviled crab cake and Okrachokie minus the okra... (I am an okra snob and frozen just doesn't cut the cake, but that's just me). What was left was artichokes and calamari. I also LOVE red beans and rice. This version contained andouille sausage.   How was it? The calamari was fried with the artichokes and that's where it goes wrong. Calamari cook extremely fast, so fast in fact that the breading is often under cooked while the calamari over cook. They come out a bit rubbery and the artichokes were soggy. The breading was a bit bland. Which was a bit of a shock.  When I was looking the menu over I was rather intimated by all the Cajun and jalapeno ingredients, but I shouldn't have been. The heat is warm and builds, but stays rather mellow. Sauce is king here, delish!   Next up is the red beans and rice. I got here at 7:45-8pm and they close at 9. I am saying this because it is rather late to be ordering food. The rice was perfect. The seasoning was spot-on! Really good flavor here. However, the sausage tasted like it had been cooking for about 24 hrs, way over cooked and a bit grainy textured. The beans were good, maybe a bit dry, but again, the flavor was as really great!   Lastly, the crab cake. I saved this for last because it was my favorite! I am a Floridian originally and this deviled crab cake took me back to my home state. They are thick (possibly a bit too thick) but taste just like the thinly battered deviled crab I grew up with. Don't expect it to be a Maryland crab cake... this is purely the Southern deviled crab cake.   I'll will be returning to tray actual dinners and at a better time.   Update! I returned to CYD this evening and got the red beans and rice again, the crab cake again, and this time a kids shrimp with Mac and cheese. All the items were cooked to perfection! The crab cake was superb for a Cajun crab cake (which is served deviled crab style, I love it!) I also ordered fried pickles, which are new to the menu and they are probably the BEST fried pickles I've had in a long while! They are dill and crunchy! I say this because pickles are wet and that usually makes the batter coating a bit soggy, not the case! These are crunchy dill and the breading stays crunchy also! The sauce has just enough kick for you to know it's spicy, but I was still able to keep dipping.  I am happily updating my three stars to 4! Can't wait to try more of the seafood!! Enjoy!",

    "text": "Yay! Cajun Yard Dog is here! Great service and wow what a great job they did remodeling the location. It really makes a difference for the shopping center.  As for the food, it's just what I expected excellent. Clasic Cajun favorites. Things not to skip out on:  The salad with honey mustard dressing. The honey mustard dressing is a scratch dressing with garlic and a mild chili pepper that give it an excellent flavor almost like a pepper jelly.  The fried catfish- super light and flakey you cannot miss with this.  The fried chicken on the bone. You will have to wait a bit longer but it is very worth while. The chicken is pressure cooked with a unique light flaky batter.  Red beans and rice. My favorite side has a nice flavor and comes with huge chunks of jambalaya sausage on top.  Chocolate pecan pie. Done right. The pecans are chopped which makes for a naturally sweeter pie and they are plentiful. Best pie around!",

I came in on a Saturday night for dinner with a friend. It wasn't crowded and quickly seated. I ordered the Berry Habanero because, if you read the ingredients and you like spicy, you would too. It definitely had a kick, not nearly as spicy as I thought it was going to be. But be warned, one of these drinks is probably enough. I was only halfway finished with it and was feeling \"nice.\"  We shared the BBQ shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were huge and the bbq sauce was different with a little spice over grits. I ordered the catfish with a side of grits and sauteed veggies. I basically inhaled the veggies. They weren't overly seasoned with a great texture, not soggy, not too crispy. Grits, great! I didn't even need to add salt. The catfish was nice and crispy with a flavor of buffalo, not spicy like buffalo wing sauce but the flavor, and they give you a huge portion.   I definitely recommend this place, and get the",

    "text": "We went here on a Sunday as my son choose CajunYard Dog to celebrate his birthday. The place was not busy as only one other table was seated.   We ordered an appetizer of Calamari, two orders of blackened mahi & catfish; blackened mahi and BBQ shrimp; fried shrimp and a fried chicken dinner. Four out of the five dinners came out slightly burnt. The fried catfish was a dark brown and all dried out. There was very little fish; It was mostly dried, burnt, crispy breading. We all agreed It was the worse catfish we've ever had. The fried chicken was the same: overly fried to a very dark brown, dry and nearly unedable. My wife was unable to eat much of it. I can't fathom why a cook would send this out to customers.  The BBQ shrimp is not BBQ in the traditional sense but rather cooked with hot spices. My daughter does not like spicy food and would not have ordered it if she'd known. Our server was sympathetic and bought her out a replacement order.  Our server agreed that the food was overcooked. However, we did not want to wait for another 25 to 30 minutes to eat as the fried chicken takes about 25 minutes to cook/make so we just told her to bring us the check.   Service gets 4 stars as our server was friendly and really wanted to help but said she \"was not able\" to do what was needed and help further. I interpreted this as management does not allow her to compensate us. I guess a few dollars is more important to the owners than customer satisfaction.   I am so unhappy as we did not get what we paid for. It was money thrown away. They also need to update their menus as they have beers listed on their menus that they have not had in almost a year.     I reached out to Cajon Yard Dog on their web site asking to speak with someone but they never got back to me. This just reinforces the notion that they do not care. I am one to always give a place a second chance as everyone has off days. However, in this case, the food was so bad we do not plan to return.",

I've never had a more bland macaroni with no cheese in my life. My crab cake was only okay. I guess I wasn't expecting a unflavored panko breaded crab cake. So to get past the unflavored food I called my order in and went to the bar to pick it up. The lady at the bar was extremely nonchalant as if I was bothering her just by coming in. On the phone they did tell me that they were closing at 7:45. Which was odd because their normal hours are much later than that. Unsure as to why they were closing early. $47 later I've decided I'll never be back.",

The combo is the best deal. Two entrees for $12 plus two sides.  We have had the combo with fried catfish and blackened breast with mac and cheese and smothered cabbage, fried oyster po boy, and fried okra. I am not much of a fan of mushrooms but their beer battered shrooms are AWESOME!. They advertise the sauce as horseradish but it is more of a combo with thousand island dressing and it is quite tasty.  Beers are decent with a few local craft brews; however, they probably need to clean their lines a bit more often. The floor for some reason was sticky as well. Tip: check your bill before paying as the charges may not necessarily match the menu.",

Husband had the shrimp po boy with was decent not spectacular just decent and he paid extra to get jambalaya as a side , well they should put that on the kids menu because it was flavorless and bland , he had 2 bites and didn't even want to bring it home. I ordered the crab cake po boy , it was ice cold inside and gross . The only thing that was ok were the sweet potato fries. Place was empty on a Saturday at 6:30 pm so I'm pretty sure those 4 stars are fake! We love Cajun food and were soo disappointed today!",

I went for dinner on a Saturday night, and was surprised there were only 2 couples in the entire restaurant when we walked in. We were quickly seated by our waitress who came back with menus and asked what we wanted to drink. So far so good.  There was sleepy soft rock playing I think from the 70's or early 80's. It was not fitting for the environment. Here's an idea...how about jazz music?  One of the 2 other tables didn't like their food and sent it back. Out comes an older gentleman who asked the woman if she wanted something else. She politely declined, but he wouldn't give up and kept asking her multiple times and she seemed annoyed.  We were missing silverware, and when it came the fork looked old and bent. It should have never made it to the table. I ordered a shrimp po boy and jambalaya. The po boy was ok but the jambalaya was mushy and bland.  I was only there 30 - 45 minutes and could identify numerous areas needing improvement. I doubt the owners do not care about customer reviews as there are no responses to customer comments, but if you are reading this I suggest you look at management.",

New paint, lots of decorations making it a fun space to hang out in. I had been trying to dray my fiance here since it opened. Apparently he thought it was some form of hot dog place. What? No, definitely Cajun food without a hot dog to be seen on the menu.  We went late one Saturday for dinner and it was only moderately crowded. Our waitress was friendly and prompt with all of our orders. We started with the jalapeno deviled eggs which were just okay. Far too much salt for me to love them. I ordered the crawfish etoufee because I like crawfish but hate dealing with the shell. Etoufee is one of my only options to enjoy crawfish. I upgraded my side to gumbo and had it come out first because why wait any longer than you have to for gumbo? The gumbo was a full delicious bowl with just the right amount of spice. My etoufee was also yummy and came out on a huge plate. Even without a side or app it was definitely a two meal amount of food.   The real winner of the night was my fiance's delicious chicken and seafood jambalaya. It had all sorts of seafood in addition to chicken and sausage. It also came with a touch of heat and the restaurant provides three different hot sauces to kick it up a notch if you want.   While the weather definitely called for some spicy rice based dishes on this visit I was also excited to see lots of blackened fish and other lighter options. I love places that offer a variety of choice. It looks like they also rotate fish based specials as well!",

The chef looked even worse.   The fella and I started with glasses of $4 house wine, and for dinner, I got the shrimp fajita special - which came with a dirty straw wrapper in the giant dollop of sour cream - and the fella got a half fried oyster, half fried shrimp plate. He said the fried oysters had no taste, and he was disappointed it didn't come with tartar sauce. Each of our plates came with two sides, which was honestly too much, but my rice was super dry and tasted like Uncle Ben's, and well... the straw wrapper. As others have said, the prices are WAY too high for what you get. And Louisiana is misspelled on this Cajun restaurant's menu.  This place has so much potential, but it just feels like a sad, old, rundown, dirty bar.",

Mac & cheese was like store bought.  The okra was actually pretty good.    I was hoping for a new best place to get good fried chicken.  Unfortunately, I've definitely had better even at fast food.  I may go back and give them another try, get something different.  Just not the chicken.",

Grits were cooked perfectly. The sauce was amazing and tasted JUST like my La Marsala sauce so I'm pretty sure this restaurant and I are making similar essence (spice base/selection for the dish). It was like I was back home!! My husbands etouffee was amazing! Prefect heat on both dishes. I recently visited Cajun Queen and the atmosphere is definitely what you're paying for. This is the real deal!!! LOVE IT!",

    "text": "This is what Tega Cay needed! Good Cajun food in a casual atmosphere. It's a much needed improvement to the previous Madison's on the corner, a neighborhood bar with mediocre food.   The bar area stayed along with the tv's so you can still watch a game and grab a draft craft beer. I appreciate that they are currently carrying Windy Hill cider.  It was my birthday. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was friendly,  but seemed to be rushed. So there was no \"Have you eaten here before?\" conversation or let me suggest a few items. And throughout the evening several different servers stopped by to check in on us. We went with a shrimp and grits appetizer to start. It was good. The grits had a good flavor, but I tasted a slight bitterness that tasted like parmesan cheese which didn't quite fit the dish. But the shrimp were cooked perfectly and paired well with the grits. My husband ended up ordering a larger portion as his dinner.   For my main course, I had the shrimp and chicken etouffe with a side of gumbo. The portion was huge. The etouffe was spicy and full of flavor, just how I like it. I'd definitely come back for this dish. The gumbo was okay.  It was pretty thick and didn't seem as flavorful as the other dishes. I'd probably opt for the seafood gumbo next time instead. I also wish some bread was served with the meal. I like to sop up every bit of sauce.  So, we finally got to dessert and asked if they did anything for birthdays. The waitress wasn't sure but later came out with a piece of cake and said \"Happy birthday.\" The cake tasted like a lemon pound cake and it was divine. It was heated up and just melted in my mouth. It was moist and sweet, but not too sweet.   There's still a lot of things on the menu I want to try and I'm happy this is right down the road from me.",

I had to ask and didn't find out there was a $1 upcharge for milk until my bill came! I would have happily got my daughter juice, but there was never a mention of an additional charge for milk!  I ordered the Cajun Cobb salad for myself but asked for no bleu cheese. When I got home I realized that while there was no bleu cheese, the dressing that I was provided with was bleu cheese dressing! Wouldn't it just make sense to offer a different dressing if the customer said no bleu cheese?! $18 for this... no thanks",

The owner or manager ( he sounded like a True Ragin' Cajun'!) checked on us several times while we were eating. My husband had the Shrimp Ettoufe with mac and cheese, and was very happy with the entire meal. I had the barbeque shrimp (not really barbeque, but in  butter w Cajun seaoning), the smothered cabbage and fried okra. Everything was very tasty. The only reason I did not give the Yard Dog a 5 is because my cabbage was not hot and barely warm. We had the chocolate pecan pie and sweet potato pound cake for dessert- yum for both! Not an inexpensive meal, but a real treat.",

That being said, were this restaurant in Louisiana they'd be tarred and feathered and run out of town.  My husband and I started our meal with the chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. It was good. It did not taste like any gumbo I've eaten before, but it wasn't a bad soup if I forgot that they consider it gumbo.  My husband ordered the shrimp po-boy and I ordered the red beans and rice with andouille sausage. His shrimp were undercooked, definitely under seasoned and drowning in mayonnaise.  Water has more taste than these shrimp.  Red beans and rice from Louisiana is often considered creamy.  Red beans are cooked with ham and sausage until they fall apart and they have a creamy consistency and a pink color.  These beans needed several more hours of cooking.  The sausage in the beans tasted boiled.  The beans themselves were spicy and that is the nicest thing I could say about them.  To be honest, if you want decent red beans and rice outside of Louisiana go to Popeyes, at least they are creamy with some flavor.",

Cajun yard dog wasn't known to many of my group but we were made to feel at home right away and the service was spot on. Lisa took care of our section and she had all sorts of good recommendations and advice that made our dining experience even better! I had the crawfish etouffee with a side of green beans almandine and both were delicious. My mom had shrimp and grits and I had a bite (since I can because I'm her daughter) which was very good. The sweet potato fries were a little tired. I went around the table and checked with everyone and they were all happy with their orders and felt it was good value for the amount of food that we got. Besides the great service, what also impressed me was that the manager/owner came over a number of times and made sure that all was wonderful. I'm looking forward to going back and trying out other tempting Entrees. Also the desserts looked awesome! If I wasn't so full I would've split one with my mom, but then I would've had to waddle back to my car and that isn't pretty. All in all we had a wonderful lunch and I would highly recommend Cajun yard dog for delicious Cajun food!",

Get my meal and its a little tiny, tiny bowl of potatoes, ugh, ask if I could have some gravy for the potatoes was told sure but thats $1.00 extra. Are  you kidding me. Absolutely crazy.

It was way over cooked (I ordered it medium) and was not juicy whatsoever. The side I ordered was the sweet potato fries. They were overcooked and limp with little flavor. I feel like I totally wasted my money. I won't be back.",

It was very obvious that they were there and the cook was careless.  Also, I think we were seated close to the back area where employees can take their smoke breaks, it smelled very strongly of smoke.  It was only an issue for me because I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke.",

We have been here three times and each time we came in service was slow. The last time we came in three people standing behind the bar, three tables needing to be cleaned. We sat down at one table only to realize that it needed to be wiped off also. Thank goodness the food here is so fantastic.",
