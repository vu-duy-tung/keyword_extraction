Feel free to grab a brew on draft or a bottle in the coolers and drink right it right there or take it to go.  Taps rotate so there is always something new and delicious to try.  I'll definitely be back soon!!",

    "text": "Enduring the pains of travel delays due to the polar vortex, after an unplanned almost two day layover in Dallas, I finally arrived in Charlotte NC on a late Thursday night. Needless to say I needed a good beer...  Once I woke up I hit up Mert's Heart and Soul in downtown Charlotte for some much needed breakfast and grabbed a Lyft to NoDa. This quaint little once run down area has now been turned into the 'East Village' of Charlotte. Upon searching Yelp! for a beer shop to stock up on NC brews to fly back with me to Southern California, I found Salud Beer Shop. These guys were super helpful and gave some great recommendations on the local brews. Being just blocks from   NoDa Brewing which these guys turned me onto, its a great spot to check out. The best part, other than the fact that they have an amazing craft beer selection, is that they have a few on tap for you to sip on while you browse. If it wasn't for these guys I wouldn't have thought to check out Hop Drop and Roll from NoDa Brewing which is a great West Coast Style IPA that I'm always in favor of. If you find yourself in the Charlotte NC area, be sure to head down to NoDa and check these guys out.",

Now if I can only get the owner to give up his source for the Darklord and CBS beers we will have the perfect beer shop. *hint hint* In all seriousness check this place out next time you are in noda.

Which was actually tragic because that was my boyfriends favorite...lucky for him i was able to surprise him with a 6 pack of his own and a connection to the stuff too. It can be a little overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for. The walls are lined with shelves, lined with beers, and all the artwork on the bottles sort of blend together to make a giant quilt of mini pictures...its actually pretty cool. The staff is very very helpful, and definitely knows his stuff. I'll definitely make this a regular stop when Im on the hunt for specialty beers.",

Purchase single bottles/build your own or regular 4-6 packs.  Also a fully stocked fridge for onsite consumption.  I believe there were 6 or 7 taps, all choices formed a solid lineup.  Also will find an entire wall of bombers and thanks to the recently passed law, even saw a sign for growler fills.  Decor was right in line with the rest of the neighborhood with the artsy feel.  Comfy couch near front for seating and a few seats near the back of the store as well.  The guy running the place was really nice, friendly and seemed to do whatever he could to help out or find a selection for each customers enjoyment.  I don't get to this side of town often but look forward to going back. Only downside is their parking lot was recently taken away due to construction.  Good luck with street parking, get there early if you are going on a weekend evening.",

Really been enjoying his tastings from different breweries around the country with the empanadas for a nice little bite to eat while enjoying good company.   With Heist getting ready to open it's doors and with Noda Brewing and Birdsong all just a stones throw away Noda is quickly becoming the place to be for beer lovers in Charlotte. I suggest making a trip up to pick up some great things to bring home and hit a couple local tap rooms in the area. Or just pull up to the bar in Salud and try one of the many beers he has cold or on tap.",

Beers range in the $5-6 price point. They were nice about sampling / suggesting and it was small but not jammed packed.    The only trouble we had (and reason for - 1 star) was locating someone to serve our beer. The people who work there have the best job ever because they were clearly palling with friends and having a few beers too...which I don't mind but when you have people waiting around for a beer, it makes it awkward for them to interrupt you to ask for a drink . I was also sad to find out the three or four different Nintendo games I tried didn't work...flashback to blowing on the bottom of the games in hopes that Duck Hunt will magically appear.    One suggestion -I wish they offered a discounted draft beer of the day in the $3-4 range.",

Very helpful and always willing to help you find what you're looking for...or what you didn't know you were looking for before your visit.   Multiple times, I've come in and intended on buying a growler or six-pack of a particular brew/brewery and ended up with something else. Love it when that happens.   Love that they carry growlers from \"hard to reach\" breweries like Greenman, Mystery, and Fullsteam. Though there's nothing like getting it straight from the source, Salud makes it a nice treat when you can't make it to the Triangle, Asheville, or Hillsborough. One other gem that I was stoked to find was Slingshot Coffee. Iced coffee concentrate or ready-to-drink coffee brewed and bottled in Raleigh. I had heard about it in an article and found that Salud is one of the only places that carries it in Charlotte. Looks like I'll be in frequently to pick up this treat.   Love that you can pay with Square, too. Texting myself a receipt is so much better than printing something I'm going to throw away.   Though parking can sometimes be a pain, you can slip in and out really quick if you're picking up beer and going. If you're staying to enjoy beer on draught or take a seat and split a six-pack with some buds, you may want to find a parking space down the road a bit. The parking lot behind the shop seems a little sketchy with all of the $5 signs. I'm never sure what to trust, haha. Proceed with caution.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Dropped by the Salud Beer Shop on 4/28/12 as part of my first real experience of NoDa.  This is another great spot for beer lovers.  Great selection of beers from around the world with very reasonable prices.  Best part about Salud is that the price for your beer is the same whether you drink it there or pay and take it home with you.  They still keep the prices reasonable with no \"corkage fee\", but they do have a wide range of prices due the higher end specialty beers that they carry.  Price range is about 2$ to 20$ depending on if you want a PBR can all the way to a 22oz bottle to share with some friends.  My wife, who does not like beery beers as she says, was able to find a wide selection of sours, lambic and geuze beers that she loves.  Everybody was happy, we drank a double IPA by Mikkeller,  St Louis Geuze and Duchesse de Bourgogne.  They do have 4 or 5 taps, but the variety comes in the bottle selection. They have a dozen or so seats, if you want to drink there and I think they have a patio out back as well, but we did not head outside.  We enjoyed a few beers here before we continued our journey through NoDa.",

The store is amazing, from the graffiti outside to all the great beer inside and a freaking NES, what is not to love? I can hardly find Fullsteam Brewery in stores while I am in the Triangle, so imagine my surprise to find it here at Salud. I grabbed a growler and also saw they had growlers from Mystery Brewery in Hillsborough, NC...where I went to high school! The guy running the store said he went and got them himself, props. I am going to get some of that on my next trip.   With a more concentrated selection than Total Wine, awesome store and fair prices; I think I found my new favorite beer store. Next time when I have time I have to play that NES though, for real.",

I wouldn't say this place is just a shop, it was definitely a hang out spot as well. Couches, small table, window table, and as well as a bar has a ton of places to just chill.

    "text": "If you love craft beer and you haven't been here, it's time for you to check it out.  While it's not the largest shop in the city, it is (in my humble opinion) the best.  And I'll tell ya why.  You'll find all kinds of hard-to-find beers, including seasonal and limited release-type stuff.  You can also find a great variety of local Charlotte beers and NC beers that you cannot find many places outside of the breweries themselves.  There is a bar inside that has a really good draft selection so you can chill and have a beer as you browse.  And perhaps my favorite random thing is that there is a Nintendo set up in the corner so you can play Mario whilest enjoying said beer.  The owner is really friendly and knowledgeable as well, which makes the whole experience even better.  While there is currently no food here, the all new \"Fud at Salud\" is opening up really soon and will feature some unique sandwiches and other items to help soak up the booze!  From the looks of the work that is going on, it appears that it's close to being ready.    One other thing to note, there is no \"parking lot\" at Salud.  You have to park on the street either right in front of the place which is hit or miss, or you can head up North Davidson just past the railroad tracks to park on the street there.  That, or you can find another spot around the neighborhood.  It's definitely worth the potential parking hassle!",

We grabbed some Brooklyn Monster and sat on the patio for a little bit on a very nice day.  Totally laid back place to hang out and talk all things beer... or just relax after a long work day.  Made me want to start brewing my own beer right there with all the literature around and all the cool looking micro/craft brews from the area.  I'm sure the owner probably knows a few things about brewing and you can probably get some advice if you are undertaking a new recipe or beer you want to try to make.

    "text": "I rarely ever write reviews or anything of this nature, but my experience today at Salud prompted me to do this. I've been in the bottle shop before, so I knew the incredible selection they have to offer.  Apart from the fact that Salud arguably has the best selection of craft beer in the city of Charlotte, I'm writing this review for a different reason. It is a fairly well known fact that the owner and management of Salud is a huge Michigan wolverine fan.  This is evident by taking a look around the bottle shop and noticing the many pieces of Michigan memorabilia sprinkled in among countless empty bottles of world class beer from the likes of Cantillon, Hill Farmstead, Russian River, Three Floyds, among others. But getting back on point, I'm an avid Ohio State Buckeyes fan, and for those of you who aren't sports savvy, the rivalry between Michigan and Ohio State is one of the oldest and most heated rivalries of any sports team. Today was the day of THE Game, the annual regular season closer between Ohio State and Michigan. I know the owners and staff of salud were well aware of this because they had posted on social media earlier that they would have the game on and be rooting on the Wolverines at the bottle shop. In short, the result was not favorable for wolverines fans. I had already planned on stopping into Salud to check in on the selection before the game was even played, so I did so after the game was finished... And I was still wearing my Ohio State jersey. I was cautious while I started browsing, not wanting to draw attention to myself although I knew the guy behind the bar had seen my jersey. As I picked up a bottle of Prairie Bomb!, he spoke up, \"Hey if you're interested, there's still one bottle of Christmas Bomb! left in the cooler!\" He then proceeded to walk over to the cooler, grab it, and hand it to me. I was completely taken aback. In the midst of all of the animosity and bad blood that surround this rivalry, he went out of his way to help me get the very last bottle... And I wasn't the only customer in the store, mind you. It was one of the kindest and greatest examples of service and Craft Beermanship that I've ever experienced. First class. Absolutely First Class. Like I said, I rarely ever do this, but the amazing service I received today left me with absolutely no choice. As such, I would recommend Salud to anyone, not merely for the world class selection, but for the world class service.",

I like that you are able to purchase a big bottle and share amongst friends therefore getting more to try especially when you are a out of towner who wants to try as many different beers. If your in the area I highly suggest you give this spot a go and plan on at least an hour or two if your thirsty.",

There aren't that many places locally in NoDo where you can stop in get quality craft beers and a great wine selection to go. You can always sit and relax but that is an option you decide. They have fantastic beers on draft too and rotate them often enough you don't ever get bored. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. I wish they had a bigger patio but that is not a complaint!!!! I can't speak for the food YET but I will and update my post.   Make your way down, SALUD!",

Small but mighty!  Was looking for one specific beer, UFO Big Squeeze Shandy. They had it! Impressive. I asked for a recommendation on an IPA and I was steered to Westbrook, which ended up being very good!  The bartender was getting ready for a Ballast Point Tap take over and I might have stayed if my car wasn't illegally parked with the blinkers on! He did give me a swig of Sculpin Habanero - oooh feel the burn baby!  Great place for beer lovers and Nerds alike to get some good brews!!",

Being that I was visiting Charlotte only for the weekend I did and boy am I excited I did! Salud not only had the Heist beer I was drinking, but also offered crowler fill ups of it (Heist didn't)!! So I bought 3 of them to go! Salud had an amazing line up on their 12ish drafts, a fantastic bottle selection, and some awesome merchandise. My only complaint was that they didn't have the purple baseball shirt in my size (XL), or I would have bought one! I had to settle for getting a tulip glass instead because their slogan was too awesome not to buy something of! This will always be one of my top stops whenever visiting Charlotte! Thanks again and Salud",

This was super convenient to a number of well rated restaurants.  The shop was pretty big and has a large variety of bottles both on shelves and in the fridges. You can also try one of their 12 beers on tap or take a crowler of those to go.   I chose a few cans and bottles to travel back to Texas with and the lady behind the counter was super friendly and double wrapped everything for me for easy packing.  Would definitely visit again next time I'm in town -- highly recommend.",

They know their beer, and have hundreds of selections of beers to go for. They have a small bar in here that will serve up a pint, with great daily specials. The service is very friendly.  You can take your food from Fud next door into the bar and check out all the brands they offer.  The shop was clean, and it seemed like the beer inventory rotates around quickly enough that they're not trying to sell previous years' seasonal beers, or had bottles covered in dust. The shop was spotless, and had a few areas to sit and enjoy a beer.   I was happy to see that they offer some free brewing literature near the entrance.  Parking was easy!",

The atmosphere upstairs is a TAD bit different than the atmosphere at the beer shop (which I will also review so don't hold your breath that's coming soon).  Overall REAL solid spot to pick up a pack of brewskis, eat a za, and enjoy a draft beer (if you're into games they have those here as well).

They will have beers on tap that you cannot find anywhere else including beers from the brewery upstairs, special collabs and taps from Fonta Flora that you never see outside of the brewery.  They have a large selection of chilled beers as well so if you can't find anything on tap, you can grab something out of the cooler. Oh yeah, they also sell wine, cider, kombucha and will be serving food again soon.  The staff is great here as well. Very helpful in helping you in finding beer.   My only complaint is they need better air conditioning. It can get quite hot in there. And with a pizza oven coming soon, it will likely get worse.",

    "text": "This is a great little beer shop on North Davidson. They have beer and bottles of wine in the shop for sale. They have a great selection of beer and wines- definitely the spot to go for a gift. In addition to the bottle shop, there is also a little bar area with taps and a few tables for drinking there. I love that they had Fonta Flora and a few local breweries you don't see on taps too often in CLT. Service is friendly, vibe is chill and trendy, low key and casual. Highly recommend checking Salud out.",

    "text": "One of the best beer shops in the USA with the hardware to prove it. Don't believe me? Read the reviews.. search em online.. or better yet stop in for a beer! Salud knows what they're doing and do it best. The OG bottle shop of Charlotte has all you could need plus more! They are always changing things up. Bringing in new beers. Hosting cool events. And expanding their ideas to the next level.   They now have their own brewery upstairs. Search up Salud Cerveceria. If you're too lazy to head either flight of stairs they usually have one of their beers on tap. They also have wine if beer is not your thing. They have outside seating that is nice and shaded in the afternoon and picnic style seating inside.   You can order from Sabor down the street and get free delivery. Look for the cards on the table. My favorite night is obviously pint night which is every Monday and all beers $7 or under are 3.50. An incredible deal because they get a lot of one off beers and stuff you can't find anywhere else!",

Salud is an adorable beer shop in NoDa with an eclectic and welcome feel, and a bottle selection unlike any other. I went specifically for the Fonta Flora release, and it did not disappoint.   Salud is a place where you can walk in, hang out, order some Sabor delivery (free deliver to Salud!), enjoy a beer, and relax. I highly recommend it.  Street parking in available but is limited.",

The staff is great, the vintage Hornets stuff all over the place is awesome. So many good things. They offer a lot of different beers on tap from all over the place and the walls are lined with 4-packs and coolers for some \"road sodas\" if you would fancy one. We hung out downstairs, but I understand that there is an upstairs. I guess I will have to go back to explore that. Shucks.  I believe I saw a food menu somewhere but I could be wrong. I do know that Sabor delivers for free if you order online. I may bring a blow-up mattress next time and never leave.",

Downstairs they are still rocking a top level tap selection matched with a solid selection in the refrigerator case.  You may come across Maine brewing, Grimm out of Brooklyn or something you have never even heard of that you love.  They also support all the locals with plenty of noda, birdsong and triple C on their shelves.  This is a great spot to grab some of asheville's best as well, they are always stocked well with Burial.  Their owners seem like really nice people and you may even run in to them in the bottle shop or upstairs in the new spot.  I love this place for being one of the most chill spots in Charlotte.  Bottle shops galore in this town yet i still keep coming back to my old standby, Salud.  Top notch, see for your self.",

It doubles as great place to get work done or wind down with friends, seeing as you can choose from coffee OR beer. For my fellow vegans/vegetarians, there's enough for us to enjoy on the menu, both drink- and food-wise. And you can order food from downstairs, too!  There are a handful of large tables that could probably seat eight in total if we're getting comfy. There's a tabletop shuffleboard game which is fun. There are seats at the bar as well as a second countertop. There is also a comfy seating area. There is ample standing room as well which comes in handy when they have live music shows on their little stage. This place is truly so multi-faceted, it can really serve whatever purpose you need it to. Recommend checking it out either on a Saturday night or Sunday morning!",

Jason will take time to talk to you, no matter how busy he is.  The shop is small, but well stocked with many beers and wines.  It is very neat, clean, and organized.  I love the idea and how wonderfully it all fits together.  They always have a pretty good selection of beers on tap as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to buy craft beer.

    "text": "Concert time. And, of course, any wise concert goer will ensure to partake in good eats and delicious craft beer. We saw this place before, but Noda has so many great places. So this time I recalled this tasting room. Walked in and I was overwhelmed with a wave of tasty beer. WOW! Very impressive.  We sat at the bar,  and let me tell you, when I looked up at their menu I saw THREE beers on tap that were 12 ABV and above: Yes you read right. ON TAP!    We have been to 20 breweries and our fair share of bars and I was delighted to see different beers. We tried the Old Fashion and triple IPA. Even though it was 88 IBU, the IPA was a little on the sweet side with no extreme bite.   Jason was personable and engaged us often even though it was busy. He was even able to suggest a beer from the fridge. It was fantastic. This place is literally beer heaven.  This would be great if Hawaii had anything close to this, I may have never left... hahaha just kidding. They had more beer choices in this tiny estabishment than all the beer joints in the 808 state! All the conversations throughout the joint were about beer. Ok, this place is a must visit.  Each time we come to Noda it will be stop #1. Also, don't forget  to get a Crowler or 4 pack to go.",

Grab a spot at the bar or one of the tables and get ready for a fun, laid-back night. Fud at Salud is also a perfect compliment to all the wonderful beer. I'm excited to watch them expand upstairs. More room for good food and beer is always a great thing!",
