The service during my lunchtime visit was efficient, professional and polite.  The sushi was nice-- not fantastic but not bad either.  The seaweed salad was fresh but the dressing seemed a little lacking in flavor.  The fish was moderately fresh but the rice in my nigiri sushi could of been more sticky to better hold up to the dip in the soy sauce.  This place was nice.  I'd need to visit more to see if they can earn more than the three stars I gave it.  But really, I think my rating is fair.",

The sesame chicken was OK but there was a small bone in one of the pieces.  I lost my appetite after that.    Both the delivery driver and the person who took my call were very friendly.

The dinner serving sizes were HUGE and plenty for 2 people. The sushi was yummy too and fresh. They have plenty of options for vegans... with edamame, vegetable sushi rolls, etc. and fairly well priced.   I ate miso soup and the ACA roll with asparagus, cucumber and avocado. The ACA roll was so crisp and fresh and the miso soup had a lot of seaweed in it so I was happy. They make your sushi order right in front of you, which I like because you know what they are using. Being a germ freak, I was comforted when I saw them wearing gloves and cleaning the surface before and after making each roll.    I placed an order to-go and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. Oh! And don't forget- make sure to grab a take out menu for coupons!",

When here recently on a Friday night instead of another spot...mistake....After straining to see the menu in a dark, dull interior, I decided on the sweet and sour chicken.  I don't know if I just ordered the wrong thing, but the sweet and sour sour was not what I was expected at all.  I was pretty much given two separate sauces and encouraged to mix them together.   I'll just say, it wasn't what I expected (or wanted).  The chicken was a little chewy and the peppers were few and far between.    The service was good, though the atmosphere and overall ambiance were both lacking life.    There is a fair amount of parking in a well lit lot, and the place is relatively easy to find.    There's just better Chinese in the area for equal or better prices.",

Very poor service, uncomfortable atmosphere, and poor food quality.   Atmosphere: The AC was blasting and it was freezing inside.  The tables outside were covered in pollen so i had no choice. I asked the waitress 3x to adjust it.  Meanwhile, there was only one other customer in the restaurant and 4 other servers chatting behind the sushi bar. Mine finally came back and said \"the manager knows.\"   Service: I waited more and then finally asked if I could speak with the manager. From there she just ignored me and told me he would not come out to speak with me.   Food:  The fish in the sushi was old and poorly presented. Even after all that, the waitress still had the audacity to have an attitude when giving me the bill.  Can you believe it??

They only do regular fried rice, so I said ok and just got the \"meal\". Turns out it's literally fried rice with a couple chunks of pineapple... so why couldn't you just ask them to throw the pineapple in there for a side? My lord. As for the sushi I got the Philadelphia roll and spicy tuna. The philly roll was sooo overwhelming gross I literally spit it out. The spicy tuna was so full of the tempura crunch that a hard chunk of it was all I crunched down on through every bite. The menu didn't state it had the tempura in it so I assumed it was just spicy tuna and nothing more. Disgusting. Absolutely will never return. I'll make larger portions for dinner from now on so I'm not stuck eating at a place like this again.",

    "text": "Since moving to Charlotte, I have had a lot of mediocre Chinese and Asian food in my quest to find a cheap and tasty one.  Stumbling upon Gin Bu 401 is definitely a very happy accident.  My partner and I were on a quest for a new place to eat, and we could not find the place we were looking for.  We were really hungry, and decided to go ahead and stop in here.  Gin Bu looks fairly unassuming from the outside.  We went on a weeknight, and it was not very busy inside.    For an appetizer, we decided to try the crab wontons, which were pretty delicious.  They were a nice change from a traditional crab rangoon, although not too much different.  My partner ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles, which came in a tasty curry sauce.  He particularly loved that they reminded him of the noodles he used to get in his favorite Chinese restaurant.  The dish was tasty and quite plentiful.  I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, hoping they would be similar to a soba dish.  The noodles were more like udon, but they were also pretty tasty.    What I really like is that they also deliver.  We called last week and found out they deliver to our home, so I was all over that.  Our delivery took about 50 minutes, but our food was still hot and delicious when it got there.  I was quite impressed.  Their prices are pretty decent for the food they have.  Both times we have eaten there for less than $25 (well, $30 with tip), and both of us had plenty of leftovers.  Service was friendly and efficient, which is always appreciated.  This is definitely my new go-to place to get Chinese dishes.  Maybe one of these days I'll have to try their sushi as well.",

It was 930 when we walked in an hour before they close, and since we already knew what we wanted we went ahead and ordered. We ordered an appetizer, two sushi rolls and a shared entree..The food came incredibly quick all at the same. We have never felt so rushed to eat our meal. The waitress was too busy cleaning the floors and bathroom to even give us a refill. She brought us the check 15 minutes after we had sat down. Mind you we never asked for the check. My fiance still had a full entree to eat and she is practically pushing us out the door! We ended up just putting our whole entree in a to go container. We paid for our meal and the waitress had the audacity to tell my fiance that he couldn't use the bathroom because she had already cleaned it. It was barely after 10:00 at this point...If your goal was to piss someone off to the point that they will never come back again, mission accomplished! You just lost two regulars and many more to whomever heeds my advice..",

I would have given them a 5 star if they were able to deliver to my home outside of their 3 mile radius. I live 4 miles away so that was a bummer.  I loved the Crunchy role....it was worth the price and drive. I also had the spicy tuna role and the crunchy calamari. I didn't find the spicy tuna roll to be anything special but it was still good. And the crunchy calamari was good as well. I loved the spicy dipping sauce. Will def go back.",

Ginbu is not too far my office and also delivers to my home, only a few miles away so I have taken advantage of both, restaurant visits and delivery. I have typically ordered sushi, which I feel has gone downhill. The sashimi slices seem to have shrunk over the years and aren't the best pieces of fish I have seen/had. And, I don't really feel like they offer a good varirty of rolls, almost everyone includes a fried item or cream cheese. However, being disappointed with the sushi I decided to check out their chinese dishes and ordered the Sechuan (spelling??) chicken and UGH is all I will say!!! The chicken tasted like frozen chicken and I ended up spitting have of every bite out because it tasted so bad. I resolved to eating the bland white rice they sent and the veggies out of the dish which weren't that great either.  I won't make that mistake again.",

This place was really good and tasted authentic and comparable to the food back home.  The hot and sour soup had quality ingredients and was delivered hot.  Sushi was also very good.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a tempura roll.  I always need green tea so I ordered that as well and only expected to get a tea bag and I would boil water in my room.  I received a large size cup of hot water and it was so hot that I needed to give it time to cool down.  (Good thing). I would've have given 5 stars but the food seemed to have MSG.  I don't believe that MSG enhances the taste and my suggestion would not to add this in the food.  A big plus is that included in my order was all the utensils and condiments along with a cup for soy sauce.  Delivery was fast too.",

I am toying between a 3 and 4 star review but will give this place the benefit of the doubt until I try more dishes.   The inside is nothing special, a little on the dumpier side with outlet faces dangling out of the ceiling and bugs buzzing around.  I ordered the chicken pad thai ($7.25) and a roll of the fire island (tuna, avocado in tempura style, served /sriracha, masago and scallion $8.25). The service was extremely fast, helpful and attentive.  As I expected, the pad thai was a little sweeter than a traditional thai pad thai and didn't have the peanut sauce based taste. Regardless, it was pretty good and I between the shared sushi and noodles I had plenty of leftovers.  The sushi was decent, was looking for a little more heat from the sriracha as the server indicated the roll should have a little kick to it. Could have used a little more tuna, but overall I was impressed.  Another bonus for this place... they deliver! Minimum is $15 and I believe radius is within 3 miles. Ginbu just might have become my new Sunday night recovery go-to.",

Before I write this review, I want to preface it by saying that Ginbu isn't some fancy smancy sushi place (like Nikko, Enso, Pisces, Room 112, etc....though, all these places are delish). It is a smaller, low key, and cheaper sushi option. If you are looking for some crazy designed roll, this place may not be the spot for you.   -Usually, my husband and I get one of the Chinese meals (didn't really care for the terriyaki but the Ginger is great!) and two sushi rolls. We love the spicy tuna roll.....simply tuna and spicy mayo. Very tasty. We also get one of their \"specialty\" rolls like Cherry Blossom, Crunchy, or Star. I absolutely love all of these rolls. -We have eaten in the restaurant before, however, I have always felt like this place was our go-to for take out sushi/chinese. Thus, we normally get take-out/delivery. They are very quick with both take-out and delivery -They have great lunch specials......it's like $8 for two rolls and a salad or soup.",

While the folks there were friendly, they were really not attentive towards simple things like making sure we had plates, silver ware or chopsticks once the food arrived. We tried a variety of dishes.. started with a hot and sour soup which was okay, a house salad which was okay too. The chicken lettuce wraps were good until a couple minutes in to eating it I thought there was a strange smell in the food. We also had the tuna tataki (which is an appetizer and came to the table after we finished our main course), but it wasn't bad. For the main course I ordered the sa-cha chicken, and while the flavor was alright there were a couple things that really bothered me i) the vegetables in the dish were cold - not even slightly warm, they were cold.   ii) there were pieces of beef in my dish. That would not have been cool, if I was a strict non beef eater.  It's just small things like this which add up, and ruin a customer's experience and impression of a restaurant, thus putting the restaurant on their \"probably won't go back there\" list. But given that there were so many other folks who seem to have enjoyed the food there, I may give it another try, and get take out this time.",

We've had the same server the past three times and she's pretty inattentive and has a bit of an attitude. The first time we ever went I ordered a Spicy Salmon hand roll. It had tempura flakes in it which made it very soggy by the time I finished my other rolls. I had taken one bite and I simply wasn't appetized by it and asked if it could be removed off our check. Server shrugged and said no, its not their fault. Went there tonight and ordered the spicy scallop ROLL and got...another soggy hand roll. She insisted that's what I said and again, wouldn't correct the mistake. We found out we're in the delivery zone so we probably will be ordering over the phone from now on. Good but definitely has plenty of room for improvement!",

Positives- Really easy ordering, fast-service, the chicken was nice and crisp, the fried rice tasted great though it didn't have any veggies in it (which is a trend for Chinese in this area I've noticed).   Negative- The lo mein was a little mushy and pretty bland. The majority of it was not eaten. It was also a tad pricier than some of the other Chinese-American take-out spots in the area.  I don't think I was impressed enough to go back though I just might have to take Suzanne S's advice and check out the crab rangoon.",

They've definitely tried to create an Asian atmosphere, but it's not classy or even \"fun\" or lively.  My partner thought the place used to be a bagel joint.    Our server was fantastic and attentive.  Sure, it was a slow night, but we never had to wait for anything.    While the regular menu looked pretty extensive, the sushi menu was pretty short.   We ordered several sushi rolls and all were good-sized and VERY delicious.  The only bad thing was that they were priced the same as a fancier sushi place, so I feel that I didn't get the same value.  The others offer atmosphere, so you don't mind paying the price.  Ginbu, unfortunately, doesn't offer any sort of truly \"wowing\" atmosphere, so I feel they should compensate by lowering their prices on the sushi rolls if they want repeat business.    Food and service = excellent Atmosphere = average Pricing = a bit high for the atmosphere",

A recent renovation has made it a bit more \"chic\" on the inside, leaving me to admire the cosmetic changes.  But the food, quality or otherwise, has not changed and I will continue to frequent. Also, the service is usually friendly and speedy, even on busy weekend nights.  Thanks Ginbu, I'll be back soon.",

Their sushi is priced well and they give you a yellow to-go menu that has coupons that you can use for your next visit.  They almost always have a Living Social, Groupon, or Yelp deal.  The best thing about Ginbu is that they deliver for a $1.00 fee plus tip.    Atmosphere:  The service inside the restaurant can be slow at times, but this doesn't take away from the quality and taste of their food.  We almost always order to-go or delivery because they are accurate and you can use the coupons on these two options.  Order:   We have had almost everything on the menu.  Our sushi favorites are: Cherry Blossom Roll (This is to die for), Spicy Tuna, Avocado Roll, Fire Island Roll.  Both of their soups wonton and egg drop are excellent along with their chicken fried rice.    Final Thoughts:  We eat here almost once a week and always get take out or delivery.",

    "text": "It seems like this is a popular sushi place, but since it's also billed as a Chinese restaurant I decided to try some items off of that menu. However, I was extremely disappointed.   Their version of the classic General Tso's chicken, \"Spicy 401\", was neither spicy nor fried properly. Although the portion size was generous, I couldn't eat any more after a couple of bites. I also tried their Pad Thai, which was utterly flavorless and felt very cobbled together. I wouldn't recommend either dish, or Ginbu as a whole",

    "text": "Ginbu is my bf's absolute fave sushi spot in town. We found them through Groupon and have been back more times than I can count- probably because the sushi is really good and the restaurant is chill and lowkey. It's just off Providence and super easy to find. The parking lot is kind of small but we've never had an issue finding a spot. Inside is a small takeout counter and a quaint dining area off to the right. We always grab the second from the last booth on the wall. The first waitress we ever had at Ginbu was really pleasant. All the ones we've had since then have been okay- not particularly kind but not rude either. They get our orders right and our drinks filled so we keep coming back. Yesterday we had the Spicy Tuna roll, an eel roll, and wings to start (we def didn't need the wings). The Spicy Tuna was the best roll I've had in a long time. I ordered the teriyaki chicken and he ordered General Tso's. Both were good but I liked his better because it had more sauce. Their teriyaki dish is a bit drier than I prefer, but now I bring my own shrimp sauce since they refuse to carry it. My bf loves this place so I've made the necessary adjustments lol. Definitely try this place. Be sure to get the Groupon!",

    "text": "Dined in and ordered delivery from ginbu, it has been a positive experience in terms of quality of food and service. I'm usually hesitant to try places that feature multiple cuisines out of fear that they're doing many things poorly instead of a few things well. They've exceeded my expectations and done a solid to outstanding job on various items. Specifically I've searched Charlotte for good hot and sour soup and good veggie pad thai--things that are harder to find here than one would expect--and ginbu delivered. Went there for sushi also, found they did a solid job and it was a good value.",

I placed an order by phone and picked it up about 10-15 minutes later. The food was hot, ready and the check-out was quick and easy.  The egg roll was ok. Nothing fantastic - pretty much your standard Chinese take-out fare, though a bit skimpy on the filling.   I went for my old standby of cashew chicken. The portion was large, the balance of veggies to chicken was good. Flavor was good... not exciting, but it worked well for the meal. Good mix of veggies - zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, water chesnuts. The chicken was a bit soft and mushy - in chunks as opposed to slices or thin pieces.   It's a big enough portion and enough flavor that I'd go back again and try some of the other dishes. I'm not a \"fan\" where I'd recommend it right away, but it's good enough that I'll try it again.",

    "text": "We stopped by on a Friday night around 7pm for dinner. Parking spaces were tight and very limited (but I guess that's the norm for this area of Charlotte). Once inside, it took a few minutes before someone acknowledged our presence and then instructed us to seat ourselves at any available table. The worst part of our dining experience at Ginbu was our waitress. Her name escapes me now, but she was a short, chubby Asian girl with glasses. She plopped the menus down on the table and scurried away without asking if we cared for something to drink while looking over the menu.  After about 5 minutes or so, the waitress returned to get our orders. We ordered the Crunchy Roll and two other maki rolls, all of which were decent, but not memorable. Another person in our group ordered the General Tso chicken. The portion was plentiful, but the chicken itself was overly sweet. Our waitress was MIA for most of the meal. We had to flag down other staff members to refill our drinks. Not once during our dinner did she smile at us or displayed any warmth. Service with a smile is definitely not something they practice at Ginbu 401.   The whole experience with Ginbu 401 (parking, awkwardly seating ourselves, the poor lighting, and the unwelcoming waitstaff) was very unpleasant. I am unimpressed with this restaurant and doubt I would return in the future. My recommendation to Ginbu is to hire better wait staffs and train them on the importance of being friendly and courteous to customers.",

My review mostly concerns the delivery. The driver who brought our food actually asked for a tip. I indicated during my order that I would tip with cash, which I had ready when the driver arrived. He was quick to point this out before the food had completely changed hands.   \"You marked that you would tip in cash.\" \"Yes..\" \"Well, are you going to tip?\"  Imagine for a moment you're dining in the restaurant. You're hungry. The food finally arrives. Fabulous! Then the server asks if you're going to tip. I mean, have you ever been asked this? The only time this is acceptable is after a haircut or a massage where someone not-the-service-person is asking you because they're the ones ringing you up. And even then, they are never pushy about it.   I tip as a rule because it's what one should do, but the staff at this place should be reminded that gratuity is optional and is in general awarded based on quality of service.",

Had we not just finished a 6-mile run and been exhausted we probably would have taken advantage of the $20 for $10 (dine-in only) special Ginbu is currently running.   Nonetheless, we elected on a shrimp tempura roll and split a sesame chicken and white rice entree, all around $20, and we were not able to finish the meal. The portion sizes for the price were excellent.   I am a big fan of sushi and plan on trying more of Ginbu's different selections. We called in and it took about 15 minutes on a Friday night; I call that efficiency. We arrived to pick up our food and were in and out in less than 2 minutes.",

The staff is usually friendly but at times seems overwhelmed because there is usually only one server. Overall one of my favorite neighborhood spots and a solid sushi place.",

I imagine the other sashimi cuts are still partially frozen as well if the fish is stored the same way.  The last time we ordered the sashimi still has SCALES for god's sake.  But this is the only place that delivers through Eat24 that has good vegetarian sushi options (or any good sushi options it seems) because there are such limited sushi options in Charlotte (no, Asian fusion bistros where cream cheese and chipotle mayo are key components in a roll absolutely do not count) so like, kill me I guess I'll remain a returning customer to this mediocrity.",

The Groupon gave you a discount for $30 of food, so we started out with some edamame, which was great. Just the right serving amount to not fill you up, and the flavor was excellent.   We split five rolls between us and have nothing bad to say about any of them. We got a spicy tuna, a spicy salmon, a Philly, a volcano, and one of the special tools that they were offering. Preparation and presentation were great and the wait staff was very attentive even though they were very busy that evening.   Also love the location because it is a short note ride from home. Definitely plan to return to Ginbu 401 soon, with or without a Groupon.",

I mean, what have you really got to lose.  We have since been back to Ginbu 3 or 4 times. They have great, fresh sushi and the service is quick. I love that we can get good food and be in and out. Ginbu is a small restaurant with a tight parking lot, so be prepared to park on the street if they're busy.  Their prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi establishments in Charlotte. I have not tried anything off the menu other than sushi and salad. I am a big fan of ginger dressing, but I must admit that Ginbu's ginger was not my favorite. It was a little creamier than I was expecting, but I would order the salad again.  I have seen a lot of reviews about the less-than-awesome service. I've never had bad service there; I've also never had outstanding service. It's just kind of meh, which is surprising for a smaller, more intimate setting. Nonetheless, I will continue to go to Ginbu because it's delicious and conveniently located.",

I ordered the California roll for my appetizer and the Cashew Chicken for my lunch.  It was good, but not great.  Definitely have had better.  I will say the sushi was fresh which is always a plus.  The Cashew Chicken was nothing special so I was a tad disappointed after reading all the 5 star reviews.  My service was prompt and friendly-ish.  I definitely was not wooed or chatted up, but it wasn't bad service either.  I was in and out in about 40 minutes.  Pretty much a very strong 3 star experience from beginning to end.  I might go again, but I would probably opt for Deejai down the street.",

The rice tasted like it was days old, the tempura was soggy, the shrimp was scarce... basically my worst nightmare in a sushi place.  I physically rejected the spicy salmon roll the minute I tasted it- it tasted too funky for me to be comfortable.  A few things to note: I ordered take out but it only sat in the car for 15 minutes so don't think that affected it too much  The seaweed salad was actually pretty good. That's why it gets one star.",

This was the first place I saw that had it near me. I honestly did not like my food, partly because their version varies so much from the traditional dish of minced pork, scallions and a spicy sauce. Mine had chicken pieces, peppers, bean sprouts and was made with udon noodles. I think I disliked the udon type noodle for this dish the most. Also, normally I really like the spicy savory taste of the dish. Their version was sweeter and not spicy at all.   I would try this place again but avoid the Dan Dan noodles.",

This was not sushi not traveling well, this was poor quality and tasteless sushi that traveled just fine.   I ordered delivery from here and it was bad. I ordered a lot for one person, and there wasn't a single thing that was exciting. The dumplings were fine, the fried chicken was eh, the sashimi was BLAND and NOT fresh, the crab sticks nigiri was bland, and finally... the rolls. The rolls were GROSS. They all came in a box together so I don't know which was which, but I tried each and couldn't stand any of them so I threw them out. Even the fried rice was bad. Seriously?! No idea how this place has any stars",

I came by myself and was initially the only person there but a few more parties came in after me.  My server was okay- not bad, but not great either. She got the job done.  I didn't realize how much sushi I'd be able to order with the Groupon deal, but I got 5 different rolls (2 hand rolls and 3 regular rolls) which was A LOT to finish by myself, but I pushed through. I got the Alaska roll, Volcano roll, Rainbow roll, Spicy yellowtail hand roll and Spicy salmon hand roll.  All of the rolls were DELICIOUS. One of them was actually served with a warm/cooked sauce, which I wasn't expecting but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I made the mistake of eating the hand rolls last. I'll never make that mistake again! Trying to bite/chew through the seaweed was IMPOSSIBLE, but that was no one's fault but my own.   Note to self: always eat hand rolls first...  At the end of the day, my belly was happy and full, the food was delicious and my mommy-needs-to-get-out-of-the-house sushi date with myself was successful.",

Driving around with a mad sushi craving is never a good thing, but with the Yelp deal, this place will hit the spot. The rolls aren't madly inventive or the ambience isn't the next Charlotte hot spot either. But. Last time, their version of General Tso's was surprisingly good, but should be expectedly fresh during a slower weeknight. The sushi rolls weren't small either, and I'm perfectly fine with having some good basics without the trendy $10+ rolls where it takes up three line items to describe what it is.   The service isn't top notch as the servers seem young and/or inexperienced, but I typically don't ask for much else besides the food here.",

When we went inside there were five people standing around behind a counter. We stood there for a minute and a guy looked up and told us we could sit and pointed to the tables. I noticed two tables had not been cleaned. We ordered our food. Everything came out sporadically. I got my salad. The dressing was good. Five minutes later my friend got their soup. A few minutes later I got my egg roll. Tasted like it came from a box. 10 minutes later our food comes out. My broccoli is cold. Not warm, not just under piping hot, it's cold. I ignore it and start eating the sesame tofu. Yuck. The sauce tastes extremely processed and thick. Not good at all. My friend really loved their sushi. And that's what everyone in the reviews who likes Ginbu seems to rave about. My recommendation: don't go there for regular food. You'll be disgusted.",

Everything else was sub par.  The salmon roll was the tiniest roll I've ever had; especially for that price.  The star roll was a sad presentation and unevenly distributed ingredients on the inside.  On top of that, it looked like it had been cut up and just randomly tossed on the plate.  Finally, perhaps the worst part of the experience, the tomago sushi was DISGUSTING, and this is normally one of my favorite types of sushi.  The tomago was still frozen atop the rice.  There is no excuse for this type of laziness!  This is just a sad display of assuming things are \"good enough\" and forgetting about the passion for food.  I will not be recommending this restaurant to any of my friends.",

I've only had one piece of sushi here - the ACA handroll. It was surprisingly good, and the presentation was sweet. Lightly battered asparagus, matchstick cukes, smidge of avocado. Tightly rolled, surrounded by a hoisin reduction. Tasty!  Eating in here is pretty enjoyable - super-friendly staff, comfy fusion decor, but the booth backs are loose as hell so you're going to be doing the push-me-pull-you with whoever's behind ya. Sigh.  They're angels about subbing stuff, so I've given several of their noodle dishes a go - had high hopes for the Singapore noodles, but it's a dry spice curry mix they're using, so it's pretty meh. Garlic sauce is pretty bland. But veggies are various and fresh, rice is of good quality, prices are reasonable (most veg entrees run 9 bucks) and like I said - delivery is quick. So for those lazy stir-fry craving nights, give them a whirl.",

I love the dumplings and the Dragon roll on the Japanese side, and the Chicken Kung Pao on the Chinese side of the menu (order it spicy; it lacks flavor otherwise).   It's not the highest quality sushi fish, but it's good enough, especially for the price. The chinese food isnt anything special, but it's not bad--it's pretty run of the mill.

I also had some standard veggie only rolls which were nice and fresh, and again really cheap.  My bf and I spent $25 and both left full and satisfied.  We didn't try any of their hot dishes, but there is a good selection of chinese and thai standards as well as appetizers and soup if sushi isn't your thing.",

It's fits our needs great.  Other than sushi, we have only ever ordered the Pad Thai and house ginger salad, my advice is skip those two.  However, the Hot and Sour  soup and sea weed salad were  much better.  Like I said before, the sushi is always decent, and at times really good.  If your looking for delivery that isn't pizza, Id try Ginbu.  for what it's worth even know I only gave it a three star, we seem to order from here 2-3 times a month so we do really like it.",

    "text": "I've been to Ginbu twice before and never really had a problem but this past Saturday when my friends and I decided to go for lunch is a whole different story..   I always order the pineapple chicken fried rice because I know I can't go wrong with that so that's the only thing worth giving two stars for.   Sushi was okay (if that).. Presentation is plain (no effort at all put into it) and def didn't taste fresh. You can get better sushi at Harris Teeter.  The meat in the beef teriyaki was mushy and had strange texture to it.. My friend had to ask if they could cook it some more but came back out the same.   As for service.. Our server wasn't very attentive. Seeing as there was only two other tables, we could've used a little more attention. Now for the lady at the register when we were paying for our bills.. We were NOT pleased with the attitude we were given. Our friend sent back a full plate of food because her chicken was dry and it just wasn't good so she did not feel obligated to have to pay ANYTHING for something she barely took one bite out of. So after that friend refused to pay for that (she did pay for the other item she ordered), this lady decides to catch an attitude while my sister pays, slams the register and doesn't even ask if everything was okay or greet us out the door. I'm sorry but if you have one bad experience with one person in the party, don't take it out on the others. We did nothing wrong and I feel that it was absolutely disrespectful and rude for us to be treated like that. What a shame.   After this experience at Ginbu, I'm not sure if I would come back unless I'm forced to.",

The chicken that was supposed to be fresh (you would hope) and made to order, was indeed hard, dry and cracked when you folded it or cut it. I would compare it to a wood chip or a match. I had brought this to my servers attention and he got me started some steak teriyaki instead which was nice of him and very considerate. By the time my remake was arriving to the table, my lunch break was about to be over and I was unable to eat it anyways. Moral of the story: the server was great, the sushi was yummy, the chicken based products... I don't recommend.",

She's a smart ass, not friendly, and tries to rush you out. The worst part was when she took the tip money while we were still sitting at the table. As we start walking out, she openly complains about the tip. Yes, it was only $1, but that was generous. It was a completely torn dollar, duct taped together that she'd given us as change. We laughed the whole way out the door as she whined to the boss. Very poor quality, small helpings, and over priced. I'm shocked that place is even running and she still works there. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND! Worst sushi bar in town, quality wise",

It's very comparable to Koishi in Cotswold, but this is much more convenient to me and they deliver, so this is definitely a go-to spot. I've dined in for lunch and dinner and gotten delivery/take-out more times than I can count and have never had a bad experience.  My favorite rolls are the spicy tuna, philadelphia and the shrimp tempura, and they have some specialty rolls that are great as well. My husband frequently orders the sweet and sour chicken and teriyaki chicken, which he likes, but I don't think Ginbu's menu has anything too special when it comes to the non-sushi dishes. In fact, I've ordered pad thai a couple of times and each time am slightly disappointed. Charlotte has great thai restaurants, so I think I'll stick to pad thai from another place.   If you're looking for consistently great (affordable) sushi  I definitely recommend it.",

Generally, when I dine, I am looking for a food experience, espeically in this price-point.  They have a very limited wine list, and a very limited beer selection, no cocktails!  Which, again, is all fine... who can't enjoy a Tsing Tao?  We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a summer roll (special roll of the evening), and a crunchy roll.  My husband enjoyed all of them.  I, on the other hand, don't love spicy mayo on all of my rolls, so I enjoyed but did not love.  But, for the price, it is definitely worth a try.  I fear I have turned into a sushi snob :(  Our service was fine.  Tip-- Wear a sweater!  It was freezing in there!",

    "text": "The name of this place had intrigued me every time I drove by until one drizzling, dismal evening months ago. While waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady I suspected was standing me up, I stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic, lusty and modern experience the name and sign promised.  Immediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor, I draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar. Neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence. A young woman, American, came from the back and in an unplaceable NPR accent asked me which menus I'd like. Clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift, we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before me.  The water tasted .. odd.  Smelling of a mop-bucket after cleaning a gym floor. Tea next, in the saddest, stalest teabag I have ever seen, pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water. Okay, something bottled and stronger? Alas, the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable.  Somewhere amidst the drinks buffet I'd ordered several courses of food, which came out apologetically, ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the space-time continuum.  Entree immediately, then sushi, soup, then, finally, a wilted, miserable salad. The rice was dry, the (chicken?) bland, the vegetables wilted. The soup was the mopwater, but warmer, and salted. Presumably someone had come in advance of me, ordered the entire restaurant's supply of 'interesting', 'delicious', and 'tolerable', then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophies.  My waitress apologized about the order, looking contrite but not surprised.  The shining light of that evening-apart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust, faded posters, and ancient paneling-was the 'fire island roll'.  This single element of color, flavor, and spice rescued the night from the Raymond Chandler direction it was taking.  I got my phone call, paid my tab, and left, frighteningly sober and still hungry, my head (and stomach) full of naught but unfulfilled promises.  [ed: it's entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time, and too many detective movies.]",

And the \"regular\" menu is very customizable.  Pick your desired sauce and cooking style and then pick a protein.  But....(you knew there had to be one, right)...the service is so bad.  I mean, really bad.  The final straw - and the reason I decided to write this review - happened last week.  I walked in (they let you sit anywhere) and said hello to the folks at the counter.  A guy came by with a menu after a minute or two.  Truthfully, I go there often enough that I don't need a menu and could have ordered right then but - he didn't even give me the option, just dropped the menu and kept on walking.  Okay.  No problem....maybe he isn't the server.  But then several minutes ticked by with no one coming to the table.  Two more tables of folks came in....no one waited on them either.  TEN MINUTES later the guy comes back around and asks if I want something to drink.  (I refrained from saying, \"well no....that never occurred to me\"...but it certainly went through my head)  The drink comes but, once again, he dropped it on the table and kept on walking.  Another couple of minutes go by....none of us are being waited on...so I start to get up and then, lo and behold, a server appears.  I give my order, she disappears, and then my miso soup and sushi show up in a fairly timely manner - although my server never said ONE SINGLE WORD to me.  Not \"hello\", not \"sorry for the delay\", not even \"how is your food\".    So...I will be back but it will NOT be to eat in the restaurant.  They are close enough for me to pick up a take out order and that seems to be my best option.    If you want good food...go for it!  But I highly advise getting it To-Go!",

Of the scores of times I've eaten at Ginbu 401, I've never EVER gotten a single bad dish. The sushi is always uber-fresh and the rice/noodle dishes are tasty. My friends who love ginger particularly crave the ginger dressing on their salads; I, on the other hand, relish the miso soup. We ALL agree the crab rangoon are the best in town!   There is a great selection of appetizers, sushi, hibachi/noodle dishes, etc. on the menu. Everything is very reasonably priced and represents a great value.  When I used to live uptown (for 9 years) I ordered from Ginbu 401 many times and the delivery service was spectacular.  The owner is hard-working, diminutive and delightful lady who clearly takes great pride in her establishment. She is also gifted with being able to discern which servers and cooks to hire . . . everyone here consistently delivers top-notch food and service.  Ginbu 401 is a simply wonderful sushi/asian-fusion spot which I'm glad to say is one of my very favorite go-to spots in the Queen City.  Currently, Ginbu 401 offers a $20 for $10 deal for customers using the Yelp! app.",

We told the waitress to give us a minute to look over the menu and she sat at the bar over 10 minutes on her phone without looking back to see if we were ready. She finally got up when new customers came in. When she brought the food, I could not even ask for anything more before she walked off. She came back when our food was almost done. The staff was just not welcoming or friendly at all at this little place.The food was also just ok including the sushi. I will not be returning.",

The Service was Fantastic and they handled my complaint very Professionally!  I was impressed!  The Interior is very nice looking.  I guess a Modern Asian decor.  My food was good, though no better than three yelp stars and I'm probably not going to review any places that I can not give three stars or better.    At 1:00 pm lunch on Monday I got the last Parking Space and the last Table!  This place is very popular.  I would probably eat here again except for better choices.",

    "text": "I'm pretty appreciative when I purchase a Groupon for a place that I may not have gone to if it weren't for the discount. I've passed Ginbu many times, but it never convinced me to stop because it didn't look too busy and a bit lonely on that corner.   My husband and I recently tried it during an off-peak hour. Even though my Groupon said dine-in for dinner, they allowed us to use it early. Cool. Customer service was great! Our server was very friendly and completely attentive! The pacing of getting our food was great.   We ordered tofu lettuce wraps (not on the menu, but they were happy to accommodate). They were flavorful! Then we ordered a couple sushi rolls: cherry blossom and Philly roll. They were good. The cherry blossom was made with pink soy paper and it made it look really delicate. The last item we ordered was the Kung Pao Tofu...I'd skip it next time. Not too flavorful. We also got some green tea. The pot was pretty, but the handle was secured by scotch tape...I think at that point it's time to retire it. In Asian restaurants, it's a tad disappointing when the green tea isn't loose leaf, but this tea was nice and warm on a chilly day.  Overall, this place was A-OK. You can get good food and excellent service here!",

The only reason I gave it 3 stars because the server did not seem like she cared me we were there.  I feel like she gave us menus and walked away and took a while before she came back.  Then she would serve food and not come back.  She didn't seem very interested in serving us and it wasn't that busy.  But overall the food was great and hopefully we will have a better experience next time",

It is tastey with lots of mushrooms, egg and tofu. The broth was not thick, which I also liked. The egg rolls are small and at $1.50 I thought they were a little over priced. Overall, if you stick with the sushi and soup, I think you will be pleased. Th service was great and the food was hot.",

She apologized when she brought it out saying my food was being remade because they added something I didn't ask for. She finally brought my meal out but this time it had tofu in it. Once again the order was wrong she said \"I didn't know you were allergic to tofu\" well guess what?! The menu said NOTHING about tofu being added. Round three, she didn't include the peanuts in my pad Thai which she later brought and sat the dish right in the middle of my food. The check came and she said \"I gave you a 15% discount\"  A whole $1.89 off my bill even with everything being completely wrong. We asked to speak to a manager who wouldn't even listen to our experience, she walked away from our table. This is completely unacceptable. Save your money and go somewhere that is actually decent.",
