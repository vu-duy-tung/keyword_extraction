A waitress that they have beers and drinks at the bar but we should come with people who were older.  Can't help that one of my kids isn't 21 yet.",

We went to drink and enjoy the weather.  The outside patio area is the best!!  So many chairs, so many TVs, so many fire pits.. This place is awesome.. I kid you not, my wife turned to me after being there for twenty minutes and said, \"I wouldnt mind dying here.\"  LOL.    Beer plentiful.. They have bottles.. They have drafts.. They do not have specials and we could care less.  You have to give it a try.. We will be bringing our visiting friends here next time they come to town... Do it..    Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

    "text": "Probably my favorite \"non uptown\" place to hang if the weather is nice.  Best patio in Charlotte IMO.  Food is well....bar food mostly but still great.  Big fan of the fried pickles :)  Patio is full of love seats, high pub tables, couches, etc.  There is also a fireplace (maybe two?) and TV's mounted all around the patio to view effortlessly.    Honestly, the only reason I didn't slide it up to a 5 star review is because of the parking.  Ugh....never enough spots and you may end up having to park a block down, etc.  Not a big deal but an inconvenience none the less.    NOTE: You can sometimes catch a local celebrity here also.  My latest sighting was Bill Deihl (lawyer for George Shin - for those that were here back in the day!) and also voted at one time one of Charlotte's 10 scariest people.  Guy seemed nice to me? Lol!",

Some other reviews have mentioned it, but this bar is where all the dudes who wish they were still back in their fraternity house at college hang out.  That being said, it is one of the best spots to hangout in the spring/early summer, thanks to a great outdoor area.  It's like the PlayMobil of patios...seems like they are always adding something (an extra TV, comfy patio furniture, etc.) to their collection to make it more entertaining out there.  The indoor area is lousy though...very small, and the arrangement of tables is ill-advised, but I guess it's the best they could do when given a broom closet to work with.  If it starts to rain and everyone heads for the hills, you better like the person you are standing next to...ya'll are about to get REAL close.  The food here is above average for bar fare.  The servers here have always been friendly and attentive, but something seems to happen when an employee gets the opportunity to work behind the bar.  They turn into HUGE dicks for some reason....must be a \"rite-of-passage\" thing?  So, if you can put up with the Fratstars and cranky bartenders, slide the croakies on your Costas, pop the collar on that pastel Lacoste polo, pull up your seersucker pants and have yourself a good time at Selwyn pub!",

Also, do NOT park in the back of the shopping mall next to the pub with the intention of walking over. If you're lucky, they'll stop you right there and tell you to move your car, but I saw a lot of unlucky cars with boots on 'em. We ended up parking a ways away down a street. The bouncer was very nice, and all the staff were polite and prompt. Miller and Bud buckets were moderately priced, and the fried pickle chips, onion rings and fries were also very good. No complaints on the food or beer front. Comfortable seeing to watch the game, as well. The waitstaff came around with delicious beer samples, as well. All in all, a very relaxing and awesome night. Also, great outdoor atmosphere.",

Do not let this full you.. the servers are constantly  touching there hair and faces and pulling there paints off of there skin. The pizza had no taste and the crust was burnt. How can you call it a chicken with barbecue  sauce pizza when you can not even taste the barbecue. Did I mention that the price was 15.99 what a big let down.

The service is always good, the fried pickles are always crispy and salty and while the beer list could be a bit better, you can always find something you like. The owner is also very serious about making sure the kegs are always fresh; no nasty tap line beer here!   Now, let me get down to business on these chicken nachos. I think of myself as somewhat of a Charlotte area chicken nacho connoisseur, and while many have disagreed with me, Selwyn Pub has the best chicken nachos in Charlotte. It might be the atmosphere, it might be the crowd, it might even be the sodium, but they are amazing.   Now to the best part! On to this MJ sighting. After spending many-a-happy hour on the couches of Selwyn Pub, I finally had an MJ sighting. In my book, if it's good enough for Michael Jordan, it's good enough for me.",

The burgers are very tasty and pretty good sized as well.  Since I've only been here during lunch time, I haven't tried the drink menu.  I'll have to go back some night and check it out.  The waitstaff is also a main attraction.  They are always looking out for their customers, and they are a riot if you're the type to joke around.  My favorite part of this place though, is the patio.  It's habitable even in the insane heat.  They keep fans with water misters going to keep the patio nice and cool.",

I was fortunate enough to visit Selwyn last weekend and it lived up to the expectations.  We arrived early on Sunday morning to make sure we got a good table on the amazing patio they have outside.  The service was great and on point.  There are multiple TVs outside to watch all the games and the atmosphere is perfect.  The menu is your typical sports bar menu but the pizza is definitely the highlight of this pub.  I love thin and crispy pizza and Selwyn has some of the best I have ever had.  So tasty, crunchy, and delicious!  I loved the place so much I even bought a T-Shirt in my Panthers colors.  Next time you want to go watch some sports and enjoy some great pizza make Selwyn your choice!",

It was packed for the women's World Cup game, but the service was inexcusable. First, they were completely out of menus and my table wasn't handed a menu until close to 30 min after sitting down. Finally we ordered. After waiting over an hour for our food, my waitress brings out a sandwich I didn't order. When I tell her I didn't order what she brought me, she said \"our kitchen is really backed up, if you want me to fix the order it will take another hour.\" No apology. I was starving so I just ate the bland chicken sandwich I didn't order, but was still charged full price for. My friend's buffalo chicken dip came out as globs of cream cheese with shredded chicken on top, not mixed together. All of us looked at it like \"what is that?!\" Our waitress was MIA most of the time, and we could tell she was swamped but she never appeared to care about the customer and wasn't apologetic. When the game was over we tried to hand her our checks to pay but she said she would have to be right back and wouldn't take our money... 20 minutes later she finally showed up again to take our money. If it weren't for the game being on, I would have walked out after the first round of drinks. This place was so utterly terrible I won't be back.",

The Good: The patio is one of (if not) the best in Charlotte. Fire pits, plenty of TV's, comfy seats and tables a plenty. The pizza is super solid - really, surprisingly, delicious! The service has always been friendly and pretty prompt considering how busy they get. Additionally, the beer list is decent.   The Meh: Because of the said popular patio and plethora of games shown, this place can get SO loud, SO fast. When the clock turns to 11 pm or so on the weekend evenings, the bar can get exorbitantly crowded and obnoxious. This is when I feel too old to be in such bar. Also be aware that some of the booths inside have absolutely zero padding...that does my arse no service when I'm sitting there for an hour or two.   Overall, if you can score a seat on the patio and take in a relaxing drink with a few buds, Selwyn Pub is a fine place to do so.",

Good pub food in general. details are unimportant when you're drinking stout.  Girls can be exceptional but a little snootie. Take a puppy with you.   Lastly, this place is a clique joint. Great in the summer with the women hanging out, if you know what I mean, and perfect for chilly fall weather with the ballgames and the fire pit etc.. Just know that the folks here shop at South Park and live in Myers Park and if you ain't in the crowd you better come loaded or you'll be just another guy drooling at the bar.",

    "text": "I've been here once before and it was during the summertime which is ideal since their outdoor space is great.  I like that it is a little \"off the beaten path\" but a lot of things on Selwyn have definitely changed in the past couple of years with construction and new businesses moving in.  Parking can be an issue if the place is packed, but they still make it work and it is parking is definitely worth the headache to get to this pub.  Unfortunately for me I got a whole beer poured on me by the waitress and I had my menu positioned perfectly on the table to funnel all the liquid goodness into my lap.  It was rather embarrassing since there was a bit of a crowd there that day, but it was the summer and I didn't really mind too much.  The waitress was super embarrassed and paid for my beer.  It's a fond memory that my friends don't let me forget about every time we think about going to Selwyn Pub.",

    "text": "Some folks I work with decided to grab a couple of brews together after work to celebrate my \"official transition\" to being full-time. We picked Selwyn Pub. This place was awesome. We showed up post 5 o'clock on a Friday. The place was hopping!  We managed to snag the patio room on the far left side of the building; the area had a couple couches, two tvs, a coffee table and a comfortable level of seclusion from the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd around front.   We ordered all kinds of food to share; chips and salsa, fried pickles, fajitas, hummos, and I ordered the chicken wings (go for the spicy honey coated ones....oh my oh my!). The food was surprisingly delish for \"Bar food\". The beer selection was not up to my standards, but when you frequent Brixx and Duckworths as much as I do, you undoubtedly produce a snobbish palate concerning your hops. Still, I was able to order Sweetwater 420 and therefore will reduce my complaining.   If you enjoy being outdoors while you wind down, this pub has THE outside setup. During the cold months, they boost overhanging heaters, and have a fireplace as well. There is ample seating, even more standing area. The service was great too. waitress had close to 7 separate checks going on with our group, but wasn't short-tempered or snippy about anything. She seemed very laid-back and friendly.  All in all, it was a very good experience. My intentions are to return again soon!",

It's hard to compete with Mellow Mushroom's beer selection across the street but at least have our local breweries (other than OMB) available. I'm guessing the owners favorite beer is Goose Isoand since that's been on tap for years now. Switch it up guys and keep us surprised! Food is meh. Great neighborhood hang out though and everyone should give it a try. I have a friend that swears by their blackened chicken wings. I usually go for the sliders. And, avoid the fish tacos.",

It was surface of the sun hot and the fans they had with mist blowing cooled you off just enough.  My husband had read somewhere that the pizza was good so we opted for that, I got a cider and he got a beer on special.  Both were relatively decently priced.  The pizza was the best I've had in Charlotte so far, we opted for the supreme, I think it was called something else but it had all the toppings of a supreme.  Pepperoni, Sausage, Green Pepper, Onion, etc.  The crust was chewy and crunchy at the same time and the cheese and sauce were awesome.  We went to a movie after and totally chowed a piece or two in the car before heading in to the theater!  Try this place out when you get a chance!",

During football this place gets packed and the people that come here are usually a fun group. As a bar this place is great to catch a beer, you don't have to dress up, and the patio is perfect.   It goes downhill though.  We first got our wings ( frozen) that were actually cooked very well.  There are a bunch of sauces to choose from so they were suprisingly very good.  I had the pizza and my friend had a sandwich.  He hated his sandwich, which is suprising because he will eat anything.  My pizza was just ok.  The service took forever and our appetizer and food came out at the same time ( a huge pet peeve of mine).    The only reason I would come back is for drinking beer outside on the patio.",

    "text": "Ugh....used to be my favorite place in Charlotte.  Unfortunately I think I have to part ways.  Not that it will matter.  Location, location, location.  Selwyn's will continue in spite of its poor ownership and management, which is a shame.  I went there Sunday to order a pizza to go and grab a beer, watch a game while I waited.  Went to the outside bar which was relatively empty and sat down.  Looked down the row and most people had empty drinks and the guy next to me was looking to cash out.  However, the bartender would have nothing to do with that.  He was engrossed in a deep conversation with a friend.  Both looking down at a cell phone and have extensive dialogue.  Never once did he look up during the 15 minutes I sat there.  Eventually, I got up to walk inside to get service.  As I walked by the bartender and his friend, I saw they were deeply engaged in a Clash of Clans discussion.  I now understand, that can be serious work if in the middle of a war.  The patrons can clearly wait this out.  When I went inside, the bartender inside was great.  Put my order in immediately, got my beer and was out the door 20-30 minutes later.    Here is the problem.  Whoever manages the place, doesn't really manage it.  Some people are great and attentive, however the majority of the staff could not care less about the customers.  I've had several of these instances there.  Wait staff that decide to take a food break in the middle of service, leaving us to get up and get napkins, order drinks at the bar and then finally interrupt her eating with another server so that I could finally ask to cash out.  I've waited long periods of time while wait staff breeze by, never taking an order, mostly congregated somewhere talking to each other.  I love the place.  The food is good for the type of place it is.  However, somebody has to get people in place who care.",

We were so dead wrong, there wasn't a single irish related thing on the menu. The server was friendly and greeted us right away, My husband asked for coffee and the server told him \"There isn't any brewed, so.. anything else I can get you?\" ... So they HAVE coffee..but he didn't feel like making it? COOL. We should have left right then and there.. I guess the server kind of realized his error, and then tried to back pedal and excuse that the coffee takes \" a while \" to brew. My husband and I have been in the service industry before and I recognize laziness when I see it. If you don't have coffee brewed, you alert the customer of how much time it will take to brew - then let them decide if they still want it.  ( The food \" takes a while \" to cook also.. WE STILL WANT TO EAT, THOUGH! )   But instead of making things complicated - My husband told him he would just take sweet tea instead and we just moved forward with trying to find out which meals we wanted. When we inquired about why there was no Irish food; the server told us it was because \"The regular customers would get sick of eating Irish food\" .... WHAAAAT? an Irish pub that doesn't serve anything Irish? This business is decorated in and advertising IRISH everything.. and it has a hanging sign that says IRISH SPECIALS. We were informed the irish specials are only during St. Patricks day.. So I guess that hanging sign is just left over from then = Example of More laziness and 2nd opportunity we should have just left.. but No.. we were running out of time, and we were hungry.. so we each ordered food the server recommended and it came out quick and hot. Thats cause it was all frozen and deep fried. Yaaay.. ( -_- ) I'm sure Selwyn Avenue Pub is a decent BAR... but don't go there hoping for anything special to EAT. Their outside seating looks inviting and the service was fast, just a little uneducated about their menu and less than eager to make you a pot of coffee.",

Cool, dark,  pubby feel indoors with an awesome outdoor patio space with heaters in the winter and misters/fans in the summer.

There are also a ton of large tv screens and tables for large groups so it is a great place to go for a game.

Per some other reviews, it does get a bit rowdy and the music could Definately be turned down a smidgen outdoors but I may just be a geezer.  Shy of 4 stars because the food leaves a bit to be desired. Not high expectations as it is a pub but there are certainly others in town with some more inventive, high quality options. I've had a couple of their wraps and all were fine, just a bit pricey at $11 for some meat wrapped up in a tortilla. No up charge to swap sides though so points there.

    "text": "I've been to Selwyn Pub about four times (to celebrate the end of exams usually). As a graduate student, this place is so convenient since it's minutes from Queens U. The outside seating area is really nice, especially when the weather is sunny. The food options are typical for a bar although I wish they had a few more vegetarian options, but there's a veggie pizza and a cheese quesadilla, both of which are fairly good. The staff, I have to say, are on their game; glasses are rarely empty, they have a great demeanor, friendly, fun. Just what you'd expect.   I went earlier this evening as a matter of fact (May 25) and had this new guy. Can't remember his name, but he was three days on the job and did fantastic. I even had him suggest a drink for me, which he called a Colorado something. It was great!",

The food was pleasing. The pub itself has a cool vibe. Some tvs and decent service. It's a little more laidback than some other bars around the way.   The outdoor area looked awesome. It was a rainy day when we went, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it, but I definitely want to hang out there. Plus I hear that Michael Jordan goes there sometimes, gotta run into mj!  The worst part about this place is the parking. Honestly if parking wAsnt such a hassle here I'd be here more often. But one of these days I'll be back. Cool place.",

    "text": "So...another one of my \"been in Charlotte 3 years and I just tried this place?!\" moments (ie Penguin). Was out with a buddy last week and after some good beer tasting at Dockworkers, we were in the mood for pizza. Decided to head in the direction of the new Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, but unfortunately (fortunately tuned) it was not open yet. Decided to go across the street to Selwyn Pub as we'd never been.   OMG...place is awesome. Was busy for a Tuesday and the patio area is twice the size of the pub itself. Huge TVs, couches, fire pits, high tops, low tops, fireplaces, separate bar. Selwyn could be my new favorite pub in Charlotte, but I'll let a few more visits in the coming weeks decide that.   Found ourselves a fire pit near the TV. Baseball game was on and checked out the menu. To my surprise and delight all the pizza was $12.99. That's right, za for $12.99. And that's their specialty pizza prices. You want A 10\" (I think that's the right side, then it's $7.99). You want an 18\" cheese pizza with all the toppings...yep...$12.99. Witnessed a few handfuls of customers picking up the pizza to-go, which means like usual I'm the last one to the party.   I'll be back soon, especially with the nice fall weather in store!",

The perfect balance of cheese and sauce and crust, the crust is amazing because it's thin so you get that fantastic mouthful of every ingredient together!  What else can I say, I absolutely LOVE it!  Go get some pizza and beer at Selwyn Pub while you sit outside on one of their couches or chairs on the patio, and if it's chilly, find a fireside seat!  But if you're going there to watch a game on TV, you better get there early because the patio and even inside is always packed!",

    "text": "What do you get when you mix a college frat party with the Meyer's Park crowd?  You get a bunch of drunk guys with shaggy hair and blue blazers pounding beers and hitting on girls while the bartenders roll their eyes.  That was pretty much the crowd at Selwyn on Saturday night.  I've gotta give this place props for their outdoor space.  It's FANTASTIC.  Huge, with lots of heaters, so you will have no problem staying warm while sitting outside in the winter.  They also have a bunch of fire pits in case you have a group that just wants to hang out.  The bartenders just don't seem like they want to be there, so the service was a bit slow for a place that at the time I was getting another round, wasn't even packed.  So here are a few reasons you want to check this place out: 1. It's the end of the night and you're looking to meet someone. 2. It's early in the night and you want to go somewhere that isn't crowded yet. 3. You want to relive your college frat years with the guys. 4. You're trying to find a place that can comfortably seat 10-15 people in one place. 5. You like cold beer. 6. You love a good outdoor space.",

Good beer, good wings, not so good everything else. Very much a neighborhood bar where people know each other.   Been here a few times usually to drink outside. Only once inside bc it is a bit dark and confined. But the beer was fine, service was ok, wings were fine as well.   Outside of the wings, I have yet to get anything that really hit the spot or made me want to order it again. This is classic bar food you eat when you are not sober. At that point it doesn't really matter.   Not a bad place, but not a place I would recommend to people looking for a cool spot to eat and drink visiting Charlotte.",

Still no signs of food coming anytime soon! Would have left by now but the screen for college football is nice and far bigger than my tv at home! Fun atmosphere if you're trying to get rowdy as well just really disappointing service and obviously way too long wait times on food. Update waitress just said they lost the ticket and brought the food BUT my burger was very cold and wrong side item and style burger.  Add another 15 min to get the check and 10 min for her to return our card and that's our time at Selwyns pub. Last thing our check and card came back covered in ketchup LOL",

It seems to be a place to try to meet people and there were definitely a couple of people that would actually move around to different seating areas to see what kind of attention they'd get.  Lot's of loafers with no socks and maxi-dresses with oversized sunglasses.  The staff makes sure that ID's are checked and that people aren't walking in already intoxicated.  All of the staff were extremely welcoming & attentive.  We only had the nacho's, but they were good with plenty of queso, chicken & yummy toppings.",

We sat at the larger community table in the center - we were on one end (two of us) and a party of 4 were on the other end. They had a server come to them, she took their order, looked straight at us and then walked away. We stopped another server and asked her about us getting a server and she kindly said \"I'm sorry, I'll take care of that for you\" then we never saw her again. So waited...and waited...and waited...server on the end cam back and ignored us again...so we waited again.   My boyfriend got up and walked to the bar and complained about us being there for 15 minutes now and not being served. 10 minutes later, the server at the end of the table FINALLY acknowledged us - and she seemed annoyed. We ordered, and got our food quickly. We ordered the wings, chicken philly and chicken tenders. It was all delicious but it doesn't stand out from any other chicken tenders, wings or cheesesteak.   Unless they get some systems in place for the set yourself concept, we won't be going back.",

    "text": "This place completely sucks. I really can't believe so many people rate this so high. The service is absolutely terrible and the outdoor bar and patio area is really gross. I don't think they have cleaned anything in months. There were nasty flies and gnats everywhere, probably due to the sticky unwiped bar, dirty tables and nasty/sticky/wet floor. The bartenders are really bad. The worst I've seen in maybe ten years. They give off a gigantic vibe of REALLY not caring about anyone or anything. It felt like they almost enjoyed ignoring patrons and moving slowly, making people wait to order or receive simple things like a menu or your bill. They also let 50+ yr old creeps hang out at the end of the bar and stare at everyone. Basically, the service here sucks, it's a gross nasty mess, and I can't believe people would spend money here. It's hard to have all of these things going for you and still succeed in the age of Google and yelp reviews, so my only guess is this place has been around forever and older people are nostalgic about it. I'll never go back.",

A couple of them were still in the pizza. What a shame! I clearly told them that I can't have pork products. Manager ( Monique) didn't even apologize for what they had done.

We got our food, with no napkins or flatware and when we tried to ask for the napkins and flatware our dining neighbors were receiving (before their food) we were rebuffed.  Perhaps our waitress was in the weeds.  One of our party was accosted by a huge cockroach (we were sitting outside) and no apology or remuneration was offered, although the dead cockroach was obviously under our table.  I wish we were offered service...that is the reason we go out.  Otherwise we would get great take out food and go home.",

Watched for a few hours as wait staffed walked back to the kitchen empty handed, walking past tables full of trash and dirty dishes.  From 5:30-8:00pm they played really loud heavy metal. When we asked about the music we were told that it was being played for 3 guys at the bar who were regulars.  Our food was dropped at our table with no cutlery or napkins. When we asked for some they brought 3 paper napkins to our table of 4.  Over all, a terrible experience.  To the management: if you don't care about your establishment, neither do I.

This is a great place to go if you are looking to grab a few drinks after work or after a Panther game.    The drinks are reasonably priced and the service is excellent.  The smoke can become a bit of a problem due to it being a smaller bar, but that might just be nitpicking on my part.  One of the best things about Selwyn is that it attracts people of all ages from the surrounding area from the old money Myers Park residents who have been living in the area for years to the young professional crowd. There always seems to be that person at the bar regaling the rest of the bar with stories from the neighborhood past that everyone can relate to in some way or another.  I would recommend this bar to anyone who is looking to have a chill evening, drink good beers, converse with good people. In my opinion, it is the perfect alternative to going downtown.  P.S. Watch out for the older gentleman who comes in after Panther home games and acts as if he has an ownership stake in the place.  His stories border on outrageous and he constantly asks where \"Coach\" is.  I'm not sure if this is a reference to Cheers or not, but it is definitely a little strange.  He is harmless though and adds to the experience in a positive way.",

It looked like they were there to watch a game or something, but they took no real interest in a particular event on tv. Guess they were just there to hang out, which that patio space is perfect for. Maybe i was jealous. Their outdoor area is pretty amazing though.

The crowd is like a fraternity/sorority reunion, with plenty of polo shirts and khakis filling out the seats.  For some reason though, ever since my friends and I started hanging out in south Charlotte more, Selwyn has always been one of, if not the first, option for the evening, especially on a weekday night.  It's simply a comfortable, casual place to grab a beer and sit on the patio. It's in the middle of a residential area, so it feels like a neighborhood pub.  I have always found parking to be somewhat of an issue however.  The lot behind the place is small and hard to turn around in.  Overall though, Selwyn is an unassuming little beer joint for me, as I have never tasted the food.",

    "text": "Although I find this place to be a little forgettable, it's partly because I've never had a bad experience there. A few friends of mine lived in the neighborhood for a while, so we would go there to start or finish our nights out, and sometimes we stuck around for the whole night.    The crowd is a little older than some of the places more in the heart of town, which works well for me, as I'm turning into a grumpy granny when it comes to kids in bars.   I have to agree with Brett M. It's a great bar. I don't know why. It just IS.",

    "text": "Though I'd constantly heard people talk about Selwyn Pub, I'd never been before the other night. And I'm not sure why I hadn't ventured over there. It's great.   Though it was a little cold, Selwyn's main space is outdoors. They have a ton of heat-lamps and space heaters, so I guess the cold won't always be a problem, but it was definitely a little nippy as it got late. The inside of the bar is super small and super crowded, so this is definitely place to hit up when it's warmer out.   Lots of people were watching the SEC football games and baseball playoffs. Everyone else was just really wasted. Fair enough. A wedding party seemed to crash the place as the night got late, and that was actually really enjoyable.   Super friendly staff, which you don't often find at a rowdier, packed bar like this. So that was nice. Drinks were pretty standard. They serve food late, which was a nice touch obviously. I'll be back. A lot.",

    "text": "This place is definitely one of my favorite places to frequent. I try to come at least once or twice every other month. I'm a huge people watcher and just like the other reviews mentioned, it is full of some fratty dudes. Boat shoes, khakis, light blue button up shirts and shades around the neck is a normal look around here. I can't seem to avoid going to places that are fratty, but it's all good. They're just worried about beers and hanging with their \"bros\". Our waitress had a bad case of ADD, but she was still a sweetheart and she was fun. Tons of good looking/classy appearing ladies (if that's what you're into). The inside gets pretty crowded fast, so I try to get some seating somewhere in their awesome outside seating area. Tons of TVs to watch sporting events, food is pretty good as well. On Bobcats game nights, pizzas are half price (or at least they used to be). Overall, love the place and will continue to stop on in whenever I can",

The bartenders were very attentive even though the place was packed.  I can't wait to go back and grab some grub.  I think this is my new hangout.",

I'm not sure why they have live music here, he should be playing a place like The Evening Muse.  But the staff was very friendly and accommodating given the amount of people there.  We didn't wait long for any service or food.  I do have to say the fried pickles were extremely salty.  I'd go back again to chill on the patio and socialize, but not to hear live music.",
