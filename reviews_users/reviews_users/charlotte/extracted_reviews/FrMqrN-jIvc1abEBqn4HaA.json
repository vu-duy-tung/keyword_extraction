We reached around 8:30PM and they would come to take an order only by 09:00PM ... We did place the order and until 10:00 PM we were not served. Not just that their entire system is so chaotic that during our wait they tried to serve us items that we hadn't ordered. Here is why I would never again visit this place .. After our one and half hour wait the chef( place being a open concept kitchen he could see the customers from the kitchen ) finally realized that we weren't served , came to us apologizing for what happened and also mentioned that he just got our order and he was gonna make it in the next ten minutes ... Well honestly we were very tired after the one  and half hour wait also with water dripping from the crappy air conditioner on my husband's head , we had to cancel the order",

We were blown away by the size of the dosa but that was nothing compared to how amazing delicious the dosas actually were, the Sambar, tomato chutney, and the coconut chutney were a great compliment to the dosas. The spice level for each of the dosas was exactly how we wanted it and the dosas were perfectly golden brown and crispy. My wife has already asked to go back again, and back we will be!",

    "text": "One of the worst customer service and quality of food I have ever seen. Me and my friends went here for lunch. And one of my friend had already warned us that they keep saying they have run out of things. But I wanted to be more optimistic.  The first thing the waiter did after we ordered food was that he said they had run out of one of the item. So we had to change that order (Still being optimistic). After that the food came in. That is when I realized that the ratio of the items and the chutneys required for those items were hilarious. It's as if they're trying to say - \"You have to manage with this\". Oh by the way, one of the chutney (Tomato) and the sambar did not taste as expected, and I'm saying this in a bad way. The only good chutney got over pretty fast. And when asked for more cups, we got the same answer. That they had run out of it and had scraped the utensil and managed to get us 1 and a half ultra small cups.  We also ordered the gobi manchurian which is supposed to be crispy, but what we got was wet, soggy gobi manchurian sauteed with some green onions in tomato sauce (literally ridiculous). And to top it off, the gobi was raw inside. Finally we gave up and asked for the cheque, which we had remind them twice to get it. And then they had charged us for the juices that were supposed to be free as we had checked in. We had to remind them about that too. Unfortunately, the experience was really bad with both the quality of food and the service. If you're running out of items, you either prepare more when it's getting over or you remove them out of the menu. Instead they feel good giving such kind of service to their customers.",

As a relative novice to this type of cuisine, I'm open to try anything but I wish some of the dishes were labeled - not because there were any restrictions (yay all vegan!) but because I'm curious as to the names of dishes I liked best to order in the future.  Customer service was excellent, the owner (manager? Host?) was very personable and asked if we were vegan and how we liked everything.  I'm sure if I didn't feel like such a noob he would have been more than happy to tell me the name of everything!  We look forward to visiting again!",

The food become cold and I am still waiting when I walked in they charged me the full price for partial food  I didn't said anything because hate to make scene. I ordered chick peas and spinach the chick peas wasn't cooked well. The only good point is lady on the counter was nice I guess that's why I didn't argue about the money.

We sat down and waited probably 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. It was the same man who initially greeted us. He did not ask us our drink order; instead, he informed us that they only had three items available. I thought that was a little strange, but I said okay and asked him to just bring us one of each thing.   The same man returned about 10 minutes later with one plate of food and two spoons. The food I have to give them credit for as it was very tasty. I have no idea what it was though. He did not give us an extra plate so we were both leaning over the table eating off of the same plate.   When we were finished, the man took my credit card payment and informed me that they didn't have any receipt paper so I couldn't get a receipt.   Truly bizarre. I'm sure the rest of the menu is delicious when it's available, but I won't be back to find out. Easily the worst service I've ever encountered.",

Same is the case with Baton Rouge having only a couple of Indian restaurants.   Their dosa - South Indian crepes - are okayish but they don't have that freshness which makes this one of the best anytime Meals. But you should still give this a try. It's better than their buffet.   Their buffet doesn't have deserts and if you get a chance to have gulab jamuns (wiki this delicacy-- and get tempted) try that.   They have a couple of rice options but the main lentil which makes a south Indian cuisine is the sambar. It's sauteed veggies cooked with lentil in tamarind sauce. That's not exactly a delight.   They do have quite a good service though. They have a check in fresh juice - which has added sugars to make it not tangy. But if you like fresh, try asking them without sugar.   The place is small, accommodates about 25.   They are experimenting with their menu, so can just give them the benefit of the doubt and hence 3 starts.",

So you still have to ask and specifically request that your food be prepared vegan to be safe.  Service people are friendly and speak Tamil.

There's usually a satisfying balance between soups, curried and stewed dishes, fried things and chutneys.  Hot chai on tap and desserts, too.  And you must not leave without ordering one of the delicious dosas.    Madras never fails to offer at least one dish I'm unfamiliar with, which is a fun surprise each visit.  I always leave feeling warm, wholesome and satisfied.    I would happily give Madras 5 stars but for the ambiance.  It's a small, shabbily-furnished hole-in-the-wall where you may find yourself elbow-to-elbow with strangers.  Not a first date place.  But for me, totally worth it.",

I finally get my Dosa( It was literally cold) after 30 minutes without the Wada and Dahipuri, I didn't say anything and was hoping that it will be coming next, but another 30 minutes passed by I am still waiting for my Wada & Dahipuri. I walk over to the counter and ask him about my order and he looked at me as if he was surprised and I asked him for 100$, now he being perplexed is sitting through the bills trying to find my order and see if I lying and to his surprise he found Wada and Dahipuri in the order, he pretended to be sorry but showed no signs and said wait for 5 minutes and I will get you both( It has been already 1 hr).I politely said no thanks and asked him to take it off the bill and I told him I have already order food from next door and I am going to eat that.   I am done with my food and I am going to pay the bill, I hand him the CC and I still haven't heard sorry and I don't see any remorse on his face( VJ I believe was his name, he was Big guy with beard)I told him I would like to provide some feedback about my experience and said the food was served cold, it was late and I didn't receive half of my order, AC was not working he said he didn't knew what was going in the restaurant t as he was in the kitchen managing and training folks and he also said all the staff is new and still getting trained but then he said the he is not sure why I am complaining as it's the cheapest food in Charlotte, he literally said think as if we are serving TEMPLE FOOD ( what he meant to say was, we are doing a favor to all folks in Charlotte by serving cheap food, so don't expect 5 star service, be happy with what you have, go somewhere else if you have higher expectations ) I said if this is what you meant by customer service then nobody will come and he said that's ok, while I was telling him 2 people walked away and went to next door restaurant  as they didn't their food on time .  I am not sure why restaurant like this are open and do they even know what customer service means, is this another means of making money for some people.  *** **************Horrible Restaurant********** Please don't waste your hard earned money in this  Sh**Hole and also Health Dept should come randomly visit them I am sure the current rating will be chopped into half.",

    "text": "WHEN I WAS SERVED 'TEMPLE FOOD'   A few minutes back me and my husband came out of this restaurant after having insipid food ( I am damn sure that's tainted too) and experiencing the worst customer service. Around 8.40pm we reached here and ordered for  a ghee dosa , vada and Dahi puri. After a long wait, around 9.10pm they served cold dosa. My husband reminded them about the vada and Dahi puri ordered along with dosa to the person who served us. While eating we could see another customer who was sitting next to our table going to the  guy at the counter and teaching him how to make the curry( Probably she would have eaten the worst today!) and leaving the restaurant. Even after finishing dosa, neither vada nor the Dahi puri were served. Again after a long wait the vada was served.( Unfortunately it just had the shape of a vada not the taste!)My husband again went to the counter around 9.40pm to check our 'dahi puri status' and came to know that the bills were already closed! They asked my husband to wait few more minutes for the dahi puri but he cancelled that order and went to the other Indian restaurant right next door. While paying the check, I asked them the reason for the delay. And as a feedback , I told them to be more cautious about customer service. Surprisingly this is how he responded: ' All the staffs are new here. I am currently training them. We were thinking of closing this restaurant because of the cheap priced food we serve here but apparently not. We don't get much profit. You will never get food from any other restaurant at this price! Just think that you have got TEMPLE FOOD from here!!!!!!!' ( Temple food - You will never find this usage in any of the dictionaries. But I am damn sure every Indian might have understood what this guy has meant! The most offensive usage anyone can come up with!! ) I was speechless! And he said IF I WANT HE CAN WAIVER THE CHARGE FOR THE VADA WE HAD which I 'humbly' denied. Last but not the least the AC was not working which I am least bothered( rather I would say least affected) now!  I feel so shameful that I came across such a worst experience at an Indian restaurant here in US from my own people!!! GUYS, ITS ALL UP TO YOU IF YOU WANNA VISIT MADARS CAFE NEXT TIME!  Note: I honestly don't want to give any stars to this restaurant but unfortunately this app is not letting me to post this review without giving a star.",

As I pulled up, I only saw one. The signage for this place was no illuminated, so it wasn't as apparent to me that it was there. So I walked into the other place asking for my order. They told me that they didn't have it and it must be next door.  Well, I went next door, which was this place and was not impressed. It really did look like a \"divey\" restaurant. I usually don't take issue with such things but the other place was so inviting and I was excited to eat the food. However, I did enjoy the food.",

We ordered samosa chaat, chili rava dosa, chole bhature, Kashmiri naan, paneer butter masala and lemon rice! Everything was delicious. Service is attentive and she knows she is serving up some of the best Indian food in Charlotte!!   The restaurant has an open kitchen concept, you can see everything while your food is being prepared. Indian food is the jam.",

This spot is all vegetarian, and if you are not familiar with Indian dishes you will struggle with their menu because they offer no description of the menu items.  Thankfully, the guy I recognized from next door assisted me with the menu and I ended up with one of the many dosa's they offer and samosa's to go.  Minus a star because once my food was ready, no one remembered to bring it to me, which resulted in extended wait time.........they did apologize.  The dosa was good and was quite a bit of food, the samosa's were not very good and didn't taste fresh as I'm used to.  I may consider another visit, but I just felt so lost looking at that menu.",

I had specifically asked her to check if filter coffee was available. Ten min later she came and told me it was. 15 min later I saw her mixing instant coffee.
