I had also heard great things about this place.  Inside the restaurant looks old.  The building looks like an old Denny's and it hasn't been updated since it was built.  But don't let that fool you.  The best food often comes from holes in the wall.  That is the case here.  We started out with an order of Fried pickles.  Out came a huge basket of pickles enough for 10 people and they were so good.  The vegan ranch dressing was also very good...better than most regular ranch dressings.  For an entree I went with the rueben which cam recommended by another Yelper.  And it did not disappoint.  Good flavors, tangy dressing.  Only changes I would make is less cheese and more kraut!  For a side, I had a side salad which came with all sorts of fresh veggies and beans.  Next time, I may just opt for the salad for dinner.  I love a good salad!    For dessert, my friend and I shared a raspberry \"cheese\"cake.  Honestly, that was some of the best dessert I've had in a while.  It was creamy, the raspberry flavor was in the cheese and it really had a nice flavor.  For my carnivore friends, don't be afraid of vegan food.  Branch out a bit, it's worth a try.  And if you like it, it's worth coming back for more.  I think vegetarians and vegans will agree!",

I have tasted a lot of the sides and have yet to find one I don't like.

We have been traveling more and more down the road of the vegetarian and vegan life and I can wholeheartedly say this place is a place that makes it miles and miles easier. We started with the \"chorizo\" queso dip and it was delicious! I love cheese! I had little faith that I could be so easily deceived but low and behold they did it with ease (I did not mean to make that rhyme but hey it worked out)  We then moved on to main courses I had a burger that I think was called the cowboy? maybe? I cant remember I am so bad about that but it was a patty with fried jalapenos and cheddar daiya cheese on it...outstanding!  I got fried onion rings with it with a side of bbq and vegan ranch which both were great compliments to my burger and rings. My guy got the brat and red beans and rice he said both were great which they must have been as I was not extended an offer to try them :/ ....... I also love the fact that they serve beer and wine! Parking is good if you can make it into this place as you have to make a life decision about how fast your going to pull into the lot as its right off independence hwy and unless your the luckiest person on earth you probably will have someone going 80 and riding your tail like theres no tomorrow. But! the food is most definitely worth the risk of careening into the lot so you can taste this vegan goodness! A must try for vegans, carnivores and everyone in the middle! Cant wait to go back!   side note! they also have a small market in the back where you can purchase many of the things they use to make their menu items which is so super awesome for the novice vegan or anyone that simply wants to incorporate more of these delicious vegan items into their meals at home! CHECK IT OUT!",

    "text": "I simply do not even know how to start this review. Perhaps some back history first. I'm a local Charlottean. I have been a vegetarian for 3 almost 4 years now. I have heard stellar things about Bean. It has been on my list of places to try. Now let me take you to where I went yesterday. It was my Mothers Birthday. She knew I had been wanting to go and suggested we try it out for her birthday meal. What a disappointment! We went at lunch time yesterday. We walk in and the hostess/maybe manager on duty tells us to pick a seat. We grab a table. The server walks to the table and begins to apologize for the lack of light in the restaurant, \"because we don't know how to turn on the lights and usually they have a veteran here, but not today.\" So we had our meal in the dark. Then another server comes to grab our orders. I ask, \"What is GREAT here?\" well the words that came out of her mouth after that was jaw dropping. She said, \"well if you like Big Macs, you should get the Good Burger, and if you like the old Rodeo burger at Burger King, you should get the Cowboy Burger.\" Ok wait a min... wth? I cannot believe the words coming out of her mouth. She, working at a Vegan Restaurant is really going to come at me with fast food substitutes? I was horrified. Especially with how vegans really want to get rid of McDonalds and thier horrible methods of food production. We decided to go with none of her options as suggested. We opted for the Rueben with mega bean salad on the side, and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with the tater tot casserole. The sandwiches were ok. The sides were simply tasteless and gross. We even got a dessert (being my moms birthday) and we ordered the KitKat Cake. That was ok as well, extremely small. But man, what a BUST! Nothing special. I should have saved my $31 dollars and gone somewhere else, maybe even perhaps the dreaded McDonalds or Burger King because that was a waste of money and time. Simply put, this place needs some work. Maybe I need to go back when a \"veteran is working\". Nah, forget about it, I just won't go back.",

The sandwich was made with Jack fruit and I could not tell that it wasn't meat!  The tater-tot casserole was a nice switch from just fries as a side like most eateries.

Served with their homemade ranch dressing and for my entree I went with their Crabbie Patty sandwich served with their version of A Thousand Island dressing. Their fried pickles were little on the greasy side than I'd prefer but hey, it's southern style so I guess it's expected. Crabbie Patty was great and filling.

But, if you are devout vegans, as we are, and you are willing to give \"healthy\" a holiday then this is the place to go.  You will not find this fare on the 'Please Eat\" lists of Ornish, Esselstyn, Barnard or Campbell but even a committed disciple of these plant-based-whole-food gurus will find their admonishing voices fading fast as he bites into, say, the Reuben or the Crabbie.  This is yummy stuff.  Make no mistake, nourishing choices can be made if one eschews the sandwiches and opts for sides like steamed kale and braised zucchini, but what fun is that?  Hell no, go for broke, order up some Buffalo fingers with that tasty vegan ranch or blue cheese, snarf down some decadent mac and cheese and polish the whole damn thing off with a carrot cupcake!  We started our slob-fest with an order of deep fried pickles.  These were a bit over the top.  The first few bites of hot, coated slices went down a treat but if one plans to tackle the whole order I strongly would urge that a bottle of Tums be kept close at hand.  Neither salt nor grease are spared in this dish.  A vegan market is attached but most of the offerings are available in your standard health food store or the Nature's Garden section of Wegmans.  One standout, though, was the sliced andouie sausage.  We took home a tub.  Dip one o' those pups in a jar of Mister Mustard and you got a magnificent morsel that screams for a swig of cold beer.  I'm not sure whether to fault or praise the Bean's celebration of deep-fried veganism.  I guess in the end I knocked 'em down a star but this food certainly beats the hell out of Twizzlers, another vegan empty calorie sin.  Go, have fun, eat like a real \"Murican\".  Tomorrow's steamed collards will taste that much better after the indulgence.",

The restaurant was not very welcoming as far as the decor. Once seated, I noticed that only two servers were managing the entire restaurant. I guess they can't afford a big staff by the looks of the place. We ordered the Crabby Dip appetizer which wasn't all that good and wouldn't get it again. I ordered the veggie burger and my friend had tofu tacos I think. Mine tasted pretty plain, lacking flavor and spice. My friend said he thought his was just okay. Surprisingly, they also house a small grocery inside with many of the same ingredients found on the menu along with many other vegan alternatives. The food was interesting. Interestingly strange to the palette. All in all, a good experience and wouldn't mind going back to try other menu items.",

I'm not a vegetarian, but I appreciate what vegetarian restaurants are doing with menus that don't solely offer salads. For my first time, I tried something safe, like a veggie burger, something they call a Good Burger (2 Burger Patties, special sauce, lettuce, Daiya Shreds, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun). If you are a McD's fan, then you will love it. It tastes a lot like a Big Mac. It's so good, you don't even miss the meat.   With a reasonably priced menu with nothing over $12, I'm looking forward to a return visit. The voyage there is another story. It's a dicey location off of Independence Blvd but any attempts at risking life and limb are greatly rewarded.    What else can I say about this place but Bean there, done that...and loved every minute!",

It was a little tricky to navigate to Bean, given its location on Independence Blvd, but this was surmountable.  I had the bean bowl with mushrooms, and it was delicious.  I am fine with the spartan simplicity of the interior, and am very encouraged by the enthusiasm of the proprietors for vegan cuisine.  I learned about seitan, a protein comparable to tofu or tempah, but derived from wheat instead of soybeans.  Plan on a tasty meal at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "First off, food is amazing. Truly the best place to get American and other cultural food that tastes very authentic. My only problem is, the service. Every other vegan I have come in contact with is cheerful and outgoing. These people dragging their feet, are very un engaging, and inattentive to guests needs. While I have felt this way my previous times coming here, this was my current visit.   I brought my family total of 5 (who are not vegan) here. They quoted us a 20 min wait, while half the restaurant was empty. Over the next 30, that's right 30 mins, the place became even more slow, and we weren't being sat. Finally we took it upon ourselves grab menus and sit down next to the 6 top table that had been clear the whole time. Immediately after, the waitress came and rudely asked for our drinks, no greeting, name, or preference on food. Just rude.  Not only this, watched about 5 tables go through the same struggle.   Got our food, the Mac and cheese was very different than the other times I've been. Over heard the cook saying she served us the bottom of the bucket. Great excuses. We traded 3 Mac and cheese sides for regular fries. At this point, my family is very mad and uninterested, also mad.   After asking for the manager, she came over and tried to make up for the problems we were having. The computers were down, the kitchen was behind, and she said they were having a bad night. Then giving excuses as to why we had such rude service,\" we are more laid back and don't do thing like ask how you are, or if you are having a good day\". To me, being a server, these are just shows of service that need to be present. Also, saying the 2 servers on where brand new and have never served before... the only 2 on. Great choice of scheduling.   Anyways, there are plenty of all vegan restaurants in the area, I would focus on keeping my customers coming back instead of turning them away with bad service and excuses.   Then, when we went up front to grab the check. She cashier was mean and rude, no eye contact and rolled eyes when we asked for Itemized receipt. Good thing we did because they added 20% gratuity, and never told us. We saw this in the parking lot after giving another 8$ tip. So 17$ tip for a 65$ bill to match the worse service ever. Pretty shading to me .   In all, I am embarrassed I brought my family here, such a shame the food is so good but the service can't match. Will be getting takeout if I ever decide to spend my money here again, or have my family come here and spend their money for unhappy reward.   Left feeling very unsatisfied with everything from greeting, to service, to manger professionalism, to basic operations.",

The waitress with the black curly hair was extremely rude and insisted that we couldnt sit anywhere else even though the restaurant was EMPTY. We then asked if we could just sit separately at tables in the back the waitress very rudely said \"SURE.\" The hispanic waitress with the blonde hair was pretty nice at least but i still couldnt understand why the first waitress was being such a b*tch about us not wanting to sit in the coldest part of the restaurant. Anyway, enough of that nasty rude girl. Everyone got burgers and they were pretty tasty. I got the jackfruit tacos and i hated them. They had no flavor at all!!! Just some warm jackfruit under a salsa verde. It already looked so unappetizing and then the taste itself was underwhelming. When i told the waitress she said that i had no choice but to pay for it. That was extremely disappointing. I didnt come to this restaurant to order things and return it for fun. I came to enjoy a dinner. My food was not good and i only ate 1 bite theres no reason why they shouldnt have refunded it. Then i tell the waitress that its my sisters birthday and they dont even have a candle to stick in the cake...she just slid the cake in front of my sister and walked away. Worst birthday dinner ever im sorry that we stepped a foot in this place. Its a shame because everything was pretty delicious except my tacos. We wont ever be coming back.",

Upon looking over the menu though, I was excited, everything sounded so good! I ended up choosing a veggie burger that I think was called the \"cowboy\". It had veggie bacon, onion rings, bbq sauce and came with yummy fries. Pretty yummy. For appetizers, we ordered bbq cauliflower and \"crab\" dip. Let me tell you, that cauliflower was EPIC! I could eat it every day for the rest of my life it was so good. The crab dip was delicious as well. My favorite part of the meal by far though was dessert. My wife ordered some peanut butter chocolate pie thing that was EXCEPTIONAL and I ordered the cookies..LOVED them both. Delish!   What's great about BEAN is that there's a vegan grocery store attached to the restaurant so you can stock up on food items and other small vegan goodies while you're there.   I'll definitely be visiting Bean again next time I'm in Charlotte.",

I ordered a cheese burger and fries, plus a buffalo sauce fried cauliflower. Burger was okay, fries fresh cut and very nice. The cauliflower was tasty, but crazy oily. All this plus one drink was $25. Overall I would not return. They could really do so much more with this place!",

The appearance of the place leaves much to be desired, but the menu was chock full of \"vegan comfort food\", currently my favorite.   I had the Philly cheesesteak with a side of mashed potato with gravy.   Both were delicious.   The sandwich was far too bread heavy for my taste, but I still had plenty to eat and left satisfied.   I liked the place a lot: very friendly people and yummy food.   I would definitely go back to try more of their offerings.",

    "text": "If I could give this experience a rating I would give it a negative 67, because it took about 67 minutes or more for my family and I to get our food. My family and I were in town and decided to try out Bean because we saw the good reviews on yelp. Welp, sadly I don't share the same experience as those reviewers. My family visited twice and the first night it was just 5 of us and our food took about a half hour. The second visit there was 8 of us. After getting fed up and realizing exactly how long we had been waiting, my aunt asked one of the workers ( who we later found out was the manager) why our food was taking so long, and not only did she not apologize but she said it's because we took a long time to order. I have never been to a restaurant where I get blamed for THEIR bad service. Her other excuse was that we were a big family, this excuse would've seemed a little more understanding if multiple other families hadn't gotten there food before us (who showed up after us). So I guess at this restaurant if you have a large family, sit at two separate tables so that you aren't waiting for longer than an hour. Also, our waitress never came to check on us while we were waiting. But after finishing our meal which was cold, my father asked if something could be done to adjust our bill, like they do at normal restaurants if your order takes longer than usual. But the managers response was, nothing could be done because our food came out fine. After being told that by the manager I asked why hasn't anyone apologized, and another worker smartly said sorry and said that they don't make food for free. This same worker also gave the excuse that it was Sunday so that's why our food was taking so long, but it was Saturday. And if that's an excuse then why were other people being served quickly. We weren't asking for free food we were asking for better service. Even if they believed they were right, it would have been at least decent to apologize. I just couldn't believe how ridiculous these people's responses were. So unfortunate because the food that was warm was decent, not worth the wait but decent. Another comment the manager made my family and I feel uncomfortable both nights as we noticed that she kept staring, it was weird. We thought maybe it was just us, but realized it wasn't after reading other reviews. I didn't have a yelp account before this but I had to make an account to tell this story to save other families from this horrible experience. Do better.",

    "text": "It's unfortunate that I feel compelled to leave such an unsatisfactory review; however my experience at Bean Vegan Cuisine was quite unpleasant. We had to wait more than an hour to receive our food after being seated. When we asked management why our order was taking so long, we simply were told that we took too long to order our food. However, we knew what we wanted, as we were already familiar with the menu, and ordered our food 10 to 15 min after arriving. When we finally were served, a few of our dishes were cold, and some were over cooked. The dishes that came out at the appropriate temperature were tasty, which is why it's unfortunate that I have to leave this review for the poor customer service we received. When the bill came, we cordially requested if anything could be done to make our experience worth the wait. We were told by the manager that nothing could be done, and the cook, simply stated that they don't make food for free. I understand that the business  was busy at the time of our arrival, but we unfortunately had to wait entirely too long while we watched at least five patrons of the restaurant receive their food before us, even though we were seated before them. I hope this review will encourage the restaurant management to adjust how they accommodate unsatisfied customers.",

I finally got sat at a table and it took over 10 minutes for someone to come by and get my drinks and I made sure I emphasize that I would like lemon, and it was forgotten, multiple times the server walked past me with my cup and my spouses cup empty. We got the cauliflower appetizer and it was AMAZING. That was literally the only good think about my meal.. I got a burger and I was excited to finally eat a burger for the first time in over a year & it was DISGUSTING. My spouse also wanted me to take a bite of his philly cheese steak and the bite i took was halfway cold. Extremely disappointed to say the least i was really hoping to enjoy this place.",

Reasonably tasty scramble and fair priced ($10) - would be nice if it came with potatoes or something in addition to the toast. Service was definitely lacking - the main lady serving us seemed to be the only doing any work; the rest were slacking and seemingly incompetent. All in all, a good spot in a city with not a great vegan scene.",

I think it's a bit over powering.  I've been here 3 or 4 times, they're easy to get to but the place I small so keep that in mind for rush hours.  I love that they have a little store where you can find great vegan products you might not be able to get anywhere else.  The reason I gave it 3 stars was because every time I've gone the service hasn't been great, they take forever to check on your table and sometimes the food takes a long time to come out.",

I've been several times with vegans and non vegans and everyone loves what they had with the exception of the teriyaki cauliflower which was really salty. I'd passed this place a gazillion times and finally decided to stop in because as a new vegan (don't know how long it will last), my hubby and I were looking for dining out options. I have a family of 6; 3 vegans and 3 non vegans. Walking into this place, it's dark, older and a bit grimy but the food is great. They have a small store inside where you can buy vegan food and products to take home too. We bought some soy curls and some of their vegan ranch dressing which is delicious.  I've eaten the cowboy burger, the jalapeno crunch burger, the buffalo cauliflower(a must have), teriyaki cauliflower, deep fried tofu, fries(yum), tater tot casserole( wasn't a big fan of the corn in it), and their peanut butter crunch dessert to name a few things. If it's your first time I suggest you go with the cowboy burger, fries and the crunch pb dessert thingy, I can't remember the name. As an appetizer, get the buffalo cauliflower with ranch, awesome!  I wish they had a place like this in the Ballantyne area, it would be a huge hit but I will travel over to east independence to eat here. It's worth it. You might feel like bringing your cleaning scrub brush and some fresh, happy paint to brighten up the place but once you start eating a delicious vegan meal, you'll forget all about it.  Go to Bean! Eat the food! Vegan or not! It's delish!   That is all.",

So, I have to admit I was skeptical about the location, it's on an extremely busy part of independence and the exterior is not exactly easy on the eyes.... but don't let that fool you.   First off, I was very impressed with how neat and clean Bean is inside. It could definitely use a little more decorating sense, but how sparkling clean the restaurant is (especially being an older building) was impressive.   Since bean is new, the menu is somewhat small, but you will no doubt find something you love. I ordered the Tofu Fingers Sandwich, which is the vegan version of a chicken fingers sandwich. You get the choose between 3 different flavors: bbq, buffalo, southern style. I chose the buffalo, which I loved. My boyfriend ordered the bbq style and added slaw, it was equally as yummy. The sandwich is $8.50 and includes a side. I chose the Northern Beans with Rosemary, soooo yummy. Slow cooked and full of flavor. My boyfriend ordered the grilled zucchini. Fresh, hot off the grill, and perfectly seasoned.   Bean is the perfect spot for comfort food for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike!  EDIT: I can't stop coming here and ordering the BEAN BOWL with EXTRA KALE and SOY BBQ. I'm obsessed and it's the healthiest obsession I've ever had! OMG! Jasmine rice, steamed kale, red beans, soy bbq curls, and vegan ranch... perfection!",

The building is unassuming; the staff unpretentious and very nice; the food homey and delicious.  I opted for the eastern NC BBQ sandwich with a side of fried squash.  Being a huge BBQ fan (see my Midwood BBQ review), I have a high bar for BBQ.  I wasn't let down.  The 'Q is soy curls, and they are seasoned wonderfully.  It had that nice spicy kick that BBQ should have.  And dammit, I'm as full (or more so) after eating this great sandwich!  It came with slaw, and I added a little bit of mustard.  The fried squash was very delicate and tasty.  Very simple preparation: salt, pepper, breaded and fried.  I'm looking forward to trying something else next time I'm here.  Thanks, Bean!",

But my fears were unwarranted, it's not nearly as odd as I imagined, but don't go in expecting a miracle. Their BBQ sandwich with tofu curls, (whatever that is) was very good. And for about half of the sandwich I could barely tell that it wasn't actual meat; their sauce, bun, and tofu complete a remarkable illusion. Kudos on their diverse and creative menu.   I also tried their mac and \"cheese,\" which was obviously tasted a little different than authentic cheese. It wasn't bad, but when you've grown accustomed to the real thing and are used to gluttonous amounts of delicious, melted cheddar.... well then nothing could be an adequate substitute.   As I said, I've come from a pro-meat perspective, and for what Bean is, I think it's excellent. The quality is there, they have a good drink selection, and the people are friendly. But I have to grade them from my eyes, and with so many restaurants to choose from, and with my uncivilized palette, Bean is just average to me.",

The market,offers a good selection of some of the best packaged vegan products. We had a brief conversation with the owner/manager andshe brought my vision of the market to fruition. I love and share the owners enthusiasm for future plans! We grabbed a quick bite which was delish and filing. The quesadilla w/pico was flavorful and delicious with the perfect texture.! And if you have ever had the delightfully crispy(burnt) or the very chewy elastic textured experience. You know what I mean. The fried tofu fingers w/blue cheesish were yummy! So unlike, the usual greasy,soggy and gummy ones you unfortunately are served at other places. Wish we had more time to hang and try more..but definately plan on returning! They have a few dishes that include Jackfruit, that I can't wait to try. And a restaurant that builds their own vegan or veggie burgers I have to bow down to it makes such a difference. A friend says they are yummy like mine, so I really can not wait. The Bean bowl sounds so good and looks scrumptuous. I have to bring that home and eat it all day it quite a bit!  The location,for those of us who don't move without the power of pollution. I guess it is fine, still alittle round about to get to, depending the direction you make your approach from. Walking, eh, I'll get there! Right now I am 15 minutes from my side of Independence almost directly opposite the Bean. But! Have to go all the way around I am told. About an hour or so? Like I said I'll get there sooner or later .The atmosphere, a little dark, a work in progress, perhaps. The building reminds me of the Greek diner we practically lived in back home. But the vibe feels like home, sort of faux bohemian, almost like the village back in the day, a comfort zone serving up healthy cuisine with open arms! I hope they will be around for a while!",

The Ruben was okay but, it  tasted different since my last visit. The mac and cheese was awful. Dry, with no flavor. Just dry macaroni with some nutritional yeast maybe. They should take it off the menu if they don't  know how to make it.  The Tofu buffalo fingers also tasted different. The buffalo sauce was bland no flavor. The only thing I found good was the chocolate cake and I still have doubts it is completely VEGAN. I had cramps after eating it. Maybe they got a new cook? By the way service this time sucked. It took for ever our server for our order. They were just talking at the cash register and the table was dirty. Something was not right this time. It will take a while to return here. Oh, my the way vegan places do not use straws. They are very harmful to the environment specially to the birds, sea turtles and other marine animals. Stop giving out straws.",

I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but had decided that I wanted to be healthier and try new things, so Bean beckoned to me every time I drove by it.  I stopped in one day and I was the only one in the place shortly after they had opened. I got the chicken fingers (tofu) with ranch dressing and I think a hashbrown casserole of some sort? OMG, everything was DIVINE!! The textures would fake out even the most discriminating carnivore. The taste wasn't the same, so it'd be harder to trick them, but it still tasted good! I loved every part of my meal. The ranch dressing was freakin amazing and I wish I could have bought a jar of it to take home.   I really wish I could have gone a few more times before I moved away. It was such a unique experience that it has made me want to try other vegan dishes. 5 stars are well deserved for this place, and the prices are good too.",

If that appeals to you, great. But in my experience, most vegans are looking for some, I don't know, vegetables and fruit. No, jackfruit smothered in barbecue sauce doesn't count.   Honestly I can get over the food, though. It's decent if that's what you're into.   It's the POOR SERVICE that I can't stand. All three times I have been have been weeknights, generally empty, with one server milling slowly around the restaurant. All three times I have waited 5-10 minutes to be seated. All three times I have waited 15-30 minutes to receive a damn glass of water. Another 15 minutes to have our order taken. 30 minutes to an hour to get our food.  Drinks sometimes never came.  I am a server and can understand some slow service when it's busy, but this is just ridiculous and no way to run a business.   Bad service. Crappy food. Grimy facilities. Completely overrated.",

    "text": "As a recent convert to vegetarianism, I am constantly looking for good places to eat. I went to Bean on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised it was packed.  The interior is very basic - wide open and just some basic tables with metal chairs.  Not super comfortable, but not horrible either.    I ordered the Crabbie dip as a starter mostly because I wanted to taste the Jackfruit I had seen mentioned.  The dip arrived and it looked just like crab dip and the taste was spot on!  The jackfruit was rather flavorless on its own, but the texture was ideal.  I would get that again for sure.   My entree was the pulled pork BBQ sandwich served with cole slaw. I would bet large amounts of money that if you gave this to a meat eater he/she would swear it is actual pork.  The texture was so spot on it was incredible!  The taste was perfect eastern NC BBQ - a bit tangy, a bit of a bite. The cole slaw was a perfect compliment and I was thrilled to have a meatless substitute for something I had been craving so much.   Overall the place was cheap.  Two lunch entrees, an appetizer, tea and a water - $27.   There is a bar area and there is a bunch of beer on shelves, but unless the night life is way different, I don't think I'd go to just drink.   But overall, I am kinda in love with this place and already planning my next trip.",

They have modified versions of so many of my old favorites: buffalo fried tofu fingers, creamy ranch dressing, delicious veggie burgers, house made vegan cheeses, and amazing desserts. My husband and I stopped here for Sunday brunch and I was impressed with their brunch offerings. We started with the cheese plate and opted for the smoked cheddar, brie, and pepperjack. All were good but the brie took home the winning prize. I also had the chicken fried tofu and waffles. Wow was it tasty! They always have a long list of daily desserts and I don't recommend leaving until you've tried the kitty kat cake. Their description is it's like a kit kat bar in pie form.  Even though it's all plant-based, a lot of meals have fried components so it's not really the healthiest. I like to come here when I feel like I deserve a True American indulgent meal. We've also tested Bean out on some of our non-vegan friends and they all gave it a thumbs up. Bean currently ties for my favorite vegan place in Charlotte.",

I always get fries for the side and I have to be honest these are some of my favorite fries in the area, so good. We also always start our order off with the tofu fingers, a mix of the teriyaki and buffalo. We also like to order to go from here as well and it's always ready super fast.

We tried to explain that we were just trying to feed our child while we ate and he told us \"you can't feed your child in my restaurant\"! Obviously we will never come here again. The owner was a complete ass to us and had no problem being extremely disrespectful to his guests. There are so many vegan options in Charlotte that I don't understand how a place like this could even still be open.

(One of the owners used to be a bail bondsman in a former life!)  Bean isn't much to look at from the outside, or the inside for that matter, but what they lack on the surface, they make up in heart and effort.   Note: I'm not vegan and have had very little experience with vegan food.   Food: A group of us went to Bean on a Saturday night, and tried a bunch of different dishes.    The appetizers of buffalo wings wasn't very buffalo-tasting, but came with a cool dipping sauce and celery. The sweet potato nachos were more like sweet potato fries with \"sour cream\" and \"queso\" drizzle and out of the two, we thought this was the winner.   Meatloaf: a bit spongy but the mushroom gravy made the dish hearty, and the grilled zucchini has a strong grilled/smokiness.  Big plus. The new side of the day was this tater-tot casserole, which had vegan sausage in it, and everyone around me thought it was the best thing we ate all night.   Tacos: This restaurant uses jackfruit in the tacos instead of tofu of seitan, and it's a nice alternative.  Think, the consistency of a firm mushroom, but not mushroomy.   FYI: Juicyfruit gum is jackfruit flavored!  We learned this from our server!  The desserts were excellent.  Don't get me wrong, their pumpkin cheesecake, carrot cake cupcake, chocolate pie are not like regular baked goods with butter and eggs...but given they're vegan, I found them enjoyable.  (The pumpkin cheesecake was the winner of the evening.)  Bottom line, Bean does a nice job, and very affordable.  An iced tea,  main dish and dessert cost me just under $20. If they can dial up the flavor on some items, and tweak some recipes, I see the restaurant sticking around for a long time.",

    "text": "If I could give a 0 I would. I used to love Bean, and raved about it to vegans and non vegans alike-- but over the last year or 2 it has declined MAJORLY. I feel sick after eating there now 9/10 times, as do the friends who eat there with me as well- but I kept giving them chances. The final straw was how terribly rude the manager & the owner (I think his name is Roy?) treated me. Due to their error they forgot to include food items in my to-go order that I paid for, and when I brought this to their attention to give them a chance to correct it they were so awful to me I actually couldn't believe I was speaking to management at first. By nature I am not a combative person, and I don't enjoy conflict, so let it be known I was incredibly polite about their error and was not anticipating any push back from them since they made a simple mistake they would obviously correct if they knew(or so I thought). They would not reimburse me or offer me the food that they forgot to put in my order. I gave them my hard earned money for nothing in return, and it made me sick to my stomach. The owner told me that he didn't owe me anything since he offers take out as a 'favor' to customers, and he doesn't care about the to-go orders (which BAFFLED me because it's not like he's giving food away for free- we are still paying the same price for the food and giving him business). It is clear he has no place in owning or running a restaurant, nor does the manager who has zero customer service or people skills. I will never waste my time or money at that 'establishment' ever again. Let this be a warning to those who are still loyal to Bean, I was too at one point, but there comes a time when you can no longer support people or businesses that don't care about their service or their customers. I don't know what happened to this place, but it has gone sooo downhill. I would rather invest my money into vegan businesses in Charlotte that deserve it. It is clear to me they are not concerned with how they treat their customers, and it is not surprising they have such a big turnover rate of employees. It all stars with the owners, and managers. Anyways, I rarely leave reviews but I thought it was important to let others know about my experience and hope they never have to go through that or be spoken to the way I was spoken to.",

    "text": "Going meatless is easy.  Preparing food without dairy and eggs and getting the same crunch, tenderness and savory flavor is hard, hard work.  The vegan food at Bean is among the best I've had.  My favorites were the teriyaki fried tofu fingers and the kitty kat cake.  I also had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini.  My entree was really good but especially the meatloaf.  Folks, if you've had vegan meatloaf before, you know all the ways it can go wrong.  The decor was pretty spare which I was expecting.  For diners that can easily order off of any menu in Charlotte, this is pretty shocking.  My dining companion and I didn't come for the ambiance.  The owners are doing the right thing by putting their resources in the menu and worrying about the decor later.  I hope Bean is around for a long time.",

    "text": "Forget that Bean is vegan. It's just delicious food served in a comfortable place.   My only experience with Jackfruit previously was an ex-girlfriend that was eating dried chips of it she fell in love with on a trip to Thailand. Our helpful waitress explained that Jackfruit has two different textures depending on how ripe it is. That is Jackfruit is meaty and perfect for shredding when unripe and is slightly sweet when fully ripe. When I say helpful waitress I really mean it. This visit was with a friend of mine with gluten & other food allergies. The waitress helpfully answered questions of what would be safe for my friend and what the cooks could do to change up what items. We ended up both ordering the Jackfruit Tacos, with slight modifications to my friends order.  When our food arrived and I had my first bite I was an instant convert. The jackfruit tacos were amazing just a wonderful spicing and such texture. The only clue I wasn't having carnitas was just a little hint of missing umami. Even then so many flavors were in this dish it is the number one thing you should order. I capped my my meal off with a peanut butter cupcake with chocolate icing that was also delicious.  Lest this review be one sided I went back for dinner a week later. This time I ordered the buffalo tofu finger with side orders of zucchini & kale. The sauce that came with it was almost a tzatziki but it paired well with the buffalo sauce that was spicey but not overly so and most importantly not oily. The only downside to this experience is their sweet tea isn't very sweet. However, they have have sugar in the raw & sweet n' low if you prefer your beverage equine fatal.",

The mashed potatoes and kale are my favorite side items (so far). However there are many delicious side I have yet to try.  Bean is a great place for omnivores and herbivores to enjoy a delicious meal together. There is plenty of seating, a bar, and of course drinks. Though one thing they do need to improve on is their beer selection, they do offer a nice list of vegan wines.",

I'm rooting for these guys and hope Bean becomes a Charlotte landmark in the near future.   The Jack Fruit Tacos -um, yum. So so so tasty. Mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy, just like I make at home. I'm not a huge fan of the mac n cheeze but us vegans are kinda snobby about one's preferred mac.   The service was excellent, adequate seating and no problemo to get to even on busy Independence.   Bean just opened so menu is a bit limited, currently no liquor license and I'm sure there's a few kinks to work out (we didn't experience any) but for the first full week - things are looking great. I can't wait to update this once the full menu is up and running.",

    "text": "Solid 3 stars for an overall A-OK experience and here's why:  My husband and I have been wanting to try this spot for a while now. As you may know, vegetarian/vegan spots are seldom found in the area and when we heard about this place it made the short list of new places to try.  If you want to come here, you really have to work for it. While it's on a popular street, getting in (and out for that matter), takes some aggressive driving. People fly down Independence!   The food is okay. Someone else compared one of their burgers to a Big Mac. Umm, I guess if that is what you are doing for, that's a compliment. If you are a vegetarian/vegan who is looking for some \"fast food\" type dishes, this will definitely foot the bill. However, if you are looking for the raw, healthy, and clean food, this is not the place. I was hoping for a vegan restaurant with culinary skills that I could not recreate at home. Rather, the ingredients were similar to products you could buy at the grocery store. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but something I could make with the help of Morningstar. Even the grilled zucchini was good, but easily something I steam or saute for dinner already. Perhaps they were wanting to fill a market for the vegan eaters, but not focus on specialty entrees, and if so, they did just that.   While the food did not win me over, the service did. The servers were very friendly and had such kind dispositions. The environment is clean, bright, and they took an older building and turned it into a nice diner-type of space.",

    "text": "When will businesses realize that no matter how good your product, if your customer service sucks it will ultimately be to no avail. Just ask Gateway computers. Their demise was NOT their computers, it was their lousy customer service! I am extremely disappointed in Bean and their LOUSY customer service. It takes a special kind of skill set to be a waiter/ waitress and the big guy at Bean has NOT been blessed with such skill set!   When my husband and I first visited Bean, we were excited. Upon first entering the establishment, we had to decide if we were willing to overlook the decor of the place in order to have a pleasant dining experience. We decided we would overlook the decor. It is much to be desired. Even though the decor is not the best, there is no excuse and no substitute for a little soap and water. The tables aren't the only things that need to be cleaned from time to time. The windows sills are dusty, and the curtains could use a quick wash in the washer.  With that said, as my husband and I have visited Bean quite a few times, we have noticed the customer service getting increasingly lax. There is nothing wrong in letting a patron know that you will be with them shortly. On one recent visit, the big guy walked back and forth about 20 minutes before he ever opened his mouth to say anything to us. He acted as if we were invisible. If you know that your weekend brunch is gaining in popularity, you need to have two waiters there at the very start!  Another thing that disappoints me with Bean is that you can ask the waiter for something and they forget, you have to constantly remind them what you asked for. My understanding is that Bean is a fairly new establishment, but if that plan to stay in business, my advise would be for them to  1.  Improve the decor 2.  PLEASE MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS TO YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Unfortunately for my husband and I, last night was the tipping point. Very unsatisfied with the customer service and we will most definitely NOT be back. Very unfortunate indeed because there are so few vegan restaurants in Charlotte. If you can't respect me then you obviously don't need my money!",

I'm not a big daiya cheese fan but it was blended in the grits pretty well. The service is what dragged this down from a 3 to a 2. Our server was not pleasant at all. She came and took our order and it was very rushed, not personable whatsoever. Our food came out by someone else and at no point did she check to see if we needed anything, how our food was or if we wanted refills on drinks...nothing. At the time we went the restaurant was not busy so I'm unsure what the problem was. I'm not one to complain because hey...people have off days no matter how engaging their jobs may be but it was unacceptable. I mentioned it to another server and she mentioned the tables are shared and apologized for the service. Poor service can wreck an experience...I hope they find a better system to service tables efficiently.",

But the jalapeno cheddar burger is one of the best vegan / vegetarian burgers I've ever had. The fried jalapenos are spicy and crispy and add a lot of great flavor. The vegan mayo and daiya cheese work perfectly (and although I'm vegetarian I'm not usually a fan of those items). And the burger patty is perfection. The total package is soooo crave worthy that I've been back 4-5 times in a month for it. This item gets 5 stars.   One time when i called for a to-go order, the girl forgot to actually place the order. So when I arrived 20 min later, i saw the handwritten order next to the register but the kitchen hadn't been given it. She told me she'd give me a discount for the inconvenience but alas - no discount given. It's ok, I'll still be back for that amazing jalapeno burger.",

    "text": "Well, we spent $100 for 3 peeps our first trip here because we tried several things and placed an order to go as well. The biggest let down was the service or to be honest, the lack thereof, servers were completely inattentive then visibly annoyed by our requests when they finally resurfaced. Additionally, we received seething glares from other servers who were just chilling at a back table by the beverage station across from where we were seated. First, we ordered our drinks and luckily, they do serve beer, not draft but at least it was craft and bottled, not canned. I ordered Mother Earth Weeping Willow Wit, thank goodness for small favors, this is one of my favorite beers, so it was one of the better parts of the experience. Then we ordered 2 apps, pimento cheesish with corn chips, better known as tortilla chips and fried cauliflower buffalo style with ranchish dip. The pimento cheeish was not good at all and it had an odd taste. The fried cauliflower did not have any buffalo sauce on it but it was pretty good despite the pool of grease and the batter falling off. We asked to trade the pimento cheeish for fried pickles but were told they do not allow trades nor do they give refunds. Okay, fair enough...but you just walk off without waiting to see if we wanted to place an order for something else?!? Cool, we just placed the order for fried pickles when the entrees arrived and as she quickly turned to leave, I added another beer. Both kids ordered the spicy \"pulled pork\" sandwich, which is made from jackfruit and topped with slaw. One ordered with fries plus Mac & cheese, the other one ordered with mashed potatoes and gravy. I ordered 2 sides as my entree, red beans and rice plus fried squash. I tried the jackfruit and the slaw, the slaw was delicious and the jackfruit put me in the mind of tofu, not bad, just a little chewy. My daughter said it had been battered and fried as well but I couldn't taste that. The Mac & cheese was extremely bland, so sad because that's a classic and likely a side most customers would want to try. The mashed potatoes and gravy side was great, very smooth and creamy, some potato skin mixed in, very tasty! The fried squash was pretty good, cut in chunks rather than slices so it was still firm, not mushy as typical fried yellow squash often is. The red beans and rice were really good, very tasty and well seasoned. Rice was cooked perfectly as were the red beans. We ordered a burger to go with fries and it took a little longer than expected so when we asked one of the many servers we had about the status, she snidely responded, \"I have no idea, I didn't place the order\"...okay, can you check on it? It arrived shortly thereafter and we asked if we could get the Kitty Kat Pie to go, the server was not happy, demanded payment upfront of \"$6.50!\" Anywhos! While we waited on the pie order, we browsed the small grocery shop inside the restaurant. It has quite the selection of vegan items including some house made items. I'm not sure that I'll ever return, good customer service is a must for me. If I do ever decide to pay a visit, it'll likely be to pick up a to go order only. As we were leaving, we noticed a sign out front reading, \"Now Hiring\"! Yes, I think that about sums it up!",

I didn't get comfort food when I first started. To find mock meats meant ordering online. I eat healthy all week, and Bean is my \"cheat\" meal. I always get the bacon cheeseburger.  SO good!! I am not the biggest sweets fan, but the desserts are fantastic. Especially the milkshakes, and kitty kat cake!!!! My daughter and I go here almost once a week. The BEST vegan burgers around! I will say I miss their old handcut fries, but I am letting that go... We brought my Anti Vegan dad here and he LOVED the queso and cheeseburger. I am here almost every week and we receive AMAZING service! Once the kitchen was slow and our order was wrong when it came, another time a new waitress had a terrible attitude, but BOTH times the waitstaff apologized over and over. The owner always is coming around to check on us, too. If you are not vegan, try this place put. If you are vegan, support one of the very few ENTIRELY vegan businesses we have in Charlotte! Bean will always be special to me because it's time with my daughter, and I am grateful to have this fully vegan establishment to enjoy!",

I don't even like leaving negative reviews like this one, but every time I want to get Bean, I have to stop and think if the drive all the way up here is worth being treated badly by whoever my server is that night. Every time, I try my best to be kind and I have never been rude to anyone because I don't think anyone should act like that- SO, it makes me very uncomfortable how easily the girls who work here catch an attitude with you for no reason. If it were for the food, Bean could legit have ALL my money and I wouldn't even mind. But as someone who feels awkward and is scared to talk to people, this is not a very welcoming or friendly environment... which is weird because the interior of the place is so home-y. :/",

I had the Old Fashion Burger with chili, slaw, mustard, and onions. I could not wait to bring my hubby to the Charlotte location. We did not get the same level service or food. As others stated, the atmosphere is drab and the floor is sticky. Our food sat in the window ready for over 5 minutes. The waitress looked at it several times and walked past it to wait on other customers. I ordered the same thing again in Charlotte. The burger was good, just not like the one in Asheville, the fries and onion rings were not great. The batter on the onion rings was half on the onions and the fries tasted burnt or like burnt oil. We also tried the pimento cheese and corn chips It was good, maybe more like a vegan cheese dip or spread. If I had not been to the amazing location in Asheville, I might have given the Charlotte location 3 stars.",

When Bean first opened everyone was friendly and welcoming, even the owners. But the last time I was there, which was about a year ago even one of the owners was rude. I placed an order at 1 and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I clock out to go on my lunch break and get there a little after 1:30. When I get there the hostess tells me that it wasn't ready, and she was really nice and sympathetic towards me. But after waiting 10 minutes and having to get back to work, I asked about how much longer. The young lady asked one of the owners (the heavier set one), he had the biggest attitude and acted like I was a nuisance just for inquiring about my order. So, I kindly cancelled my order and haven't been back since. And it's a shame because when I was pregnant I craved their food so badly. Probably, won't return for a long time.",

I had the jackfruit tacos and they were very good. Who knew that you could use jackfruit as a meat substitute? Bean does and they do it right. Wife had the bacon cheeseburger and she seemed to like it. The mock bacon on her burger tastes exactly like what I remember bacon tasting like (its been 7 years). My wife and I got the mac n cheese as a side (i know...I picked a weird side for my tacos, but hey...it's vegan mac n cheese) and we both did not really like it. It was too nutritional yeasty tasting for us.  The service was GREAT. Our server who was new (2 weeks working there...sorry we don't know his name), was very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful with the decision process. Also, our food came out in MINUTES. So quick we were shocked and pleased.  Also, a really nice guy that we assume may be the owner came out as we were finishing to make sure we were happy. Nice touch.  Great experience, great service,and great food.",

But, I ordered a tofu scramble and when it came out, I immediately saw a hair mixed up in it. YUCK! We pointed it out to the server, who explained the issue to the chef and asked for a remake. The next one arrived with a hair on the inside edge of the dish. I again pointed it out to the server and requested that she take it off my check, because I did not want it and was not ordering anything else. I told her the guys in the kitchen need to be wearing hair nets. She apologized and said it never happens, yet TWICE within a few minutes there were two separate hairs in my food. This likely happens more than she realizes. The guy with longish curly hair in the kitchen NEEDS to cover his head, because this is unsanitary! I am sure the health inspector would agree. We will never go to Bean again.",

OK, I'll let them slide on that.   We then shared a salad with their \"crabby salad\", made from jack fruit, and a rice bowl with their soy pulled BBQ. Both were more sweet than savory and we didn't really care for either. We felt like we could have easily made either dish better at home, to be honest. There just wasn't much finesse in the preperation of either dish. Both seemed just sort of thrown together...not the kind of composed dishes that you hope for when you dine out.   I should mention that my wife is temporarily on a gluton and dairy free diet, which why we chose to dine here. I have tried to also adhere to that diet as much as possible, in order to support my wife, figuring it sure couldn't hurt...sounds healthy! Unfortunately, we didn't really feel like we ate all that healthy there, mostly due to the sweetness of the dishes.",

However, the food at Bean is incredible!  In fact, I can no longer eat cheeseburgers (vegan or otherwise) anywhere else because they are always a let-down compared to Bean's jalapeno cheddar burger.  My advice; try the jalapeno cheddar burger and definitely save room for desert (i.e. their cupcakes...yummmm!!!!!)",

However, my most recent visit was not pleasant and it will be a while before I come back because of it. We got there and were seated immediately. We ordered. Our appetizer came out about 10 minutes later. It tasted different from the many times we've ordered it before. Oh well. Then it took another 30 minutes for us to get our entrees. They were good. Our waitress NEVER checked on us to ask us how we were doing / if we needed anything. After we finished our food we were sitting there for at least 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Our waitress was glued to the cash register. Finally another waitress came and took our finished plates. I had to ask for a box. Waited a few minutes, the check never came so we went straight to the cashier (our waitress had disappeared from the cash register). Our waitress never acknowledged us at all after she brought our food to the table. This was very poor customer service and showed a lack of team work. The food is good but the service is bad.",

    "text": "Environment/vibe:  This place gets a lot of business which is great that so many people are a fan of a vegan restaurant. I love the little sign on their table which talks about how eating plant based saves the planet & our health. As soon as you walk in you'll realize the lighting isn't pleasing & decor is super dated. But it was fun to see comic book covers on their wall & the Star Wars & marvel posters. No one is in uniform or has a name tag so it's awkward trying to tell who's a worker or not. It seemed like the hostess was in training (She was asking her coworkers a lot of questions about what to do next) she was so quiet we couldn't hear her, I'm not sure she greeted us. The staff seemed friendly, tried to smile even though they were very busy. My husband went to the restroom & advised me TO NOT GO IN THERE. He said they were super nasty. The tables seem to all be set up to seat 4, again they are dated. We sat right in front of the kitchen & where the staff is all working. I wish they offered booths or more comfortable & quiet seating/chairs.   Food:   I was a little thrown off at first because this place is known for being a vegan restaurant yet they offer regular drinks like any other restaurant as well as regular ketchup which is all made with regular sugar. Which in the US is grinned with bone char..? But okay, we can look past that & just order water. We ordered two small orange juices. They were just regular orange juice (Tropicana probably), i thought it was going to be something fresh or organic. I ordered the fingers & waffles (Fried \"chicken\" fingers & waffles with syrup) carrot bacon as my side & a extra biscuit to try. My husband ordered the brunch bowl (home fries, carrot bacon, sausage patty, tofu scramble, cheesy grits, biscuit). I was so excited to try the food! It's what's most important to me as well as service. We asked to keep a menu to look over what else they offered, we planned on coming back for lunch the following day & definitely ordering dessert! We wanted all of the desserts the offered lol. The waffle looked very underwhelming, very thin,  but it was the most delicious vegan waffle I've ever had! So buttery & soft, delicious! The fried tofu scramble was probably the most unpleasing thing I've ever tried.... I tried SO hard to like it. Chicken & waffles was one of my favorite things to eat before going vegan. I took several bites, added more syrup, tried to sandwich the bite in between the waffle.... still nasty. Had a hint of fishy taste to it which is stomach turning when trying to eat something sweet & savory like chicken & waffles. I should've stopped eating it once I took the first bite because I ended up feeling a little nauseous...  The biscuit was flavorless & dry, dry dry, not regular biscuit dry which is kinda what's nice about them. I put some jam on it & it was very tasty. It was like a guava or pineapple apple jam. I would definitely eat it like that again.  I tried a bit of everything from my husbands bowl & the scramble definitely needed more seasoning, the carrot bacon was good but more like carrot chip crumbs, the cheese grits were surprisingly very good & usually neither of us are a fan of grits, the sausage patty was very flavorful! We ate, were never checked on, & my side was never brought out. Once we were checked on I just asked for the check & told the kind lady (not our waitress) my side of carrot bacon was never brought out but I no longer wanted it & just wanted the check. She apologized. Our waitress then came out with the bacon & said \"I'm sorry about that\" & we said thank you but we no longer wanted it. She took it back. It was disappointing. We got our check... still charged for the extra biscuit $1.50 which in my opinion should've been taken off since they forgot my side. I didn't argue it because we just wanted to get out of there by that point.  We didn't order dessert because the tofu chicken made us both lose our appetite & the service was just ok.  Overall:  My husband said he liked his food but my chicken fingers were the nastiest thing. The food was okay, service was okay, the decor & setting was not good. If my husband insisted on trying them again I probably would only get take out if I did go again.",

You have a choice to get it with tofu (4 sauces in can be tossed in) Or portebello mushrooms.   I got to try the Jack fruit tacos and they were amazing! I had never had Jack fruit before, so I had no idea what to expect. I love the texture of this exotic fruit. There is a great smokey-ness to this taco and a kick as well.

We went in and no one greeted us / even acknowledged we were there. Eventually, the manager moving slower than I've seen any restaurant employee EVER walk, came over to ask how many we had (5 of us standing there). He walked away, served other people, took their bills, then finally came back to us saying where he was \"planning on seating us\". I went and sat down whereas the manager asked the people at our long table if it was okay.... then came back and gave us the menus.  Clearly, it was going to be a bad experience since it started off so poorly.   He eventually came back to ask what we wanted to drink, but we had more than enough time to read the menu and figure out what we all wanted.   When our food came out, my brother wasn't given his extra side that he ordered (rice & beans) and the kid who brought the food out proceeded to tell us that it was rung up as something else and kept talking about it. All he had to do was apologize or say okay let me go get it.   I got the fishless fish sandwich because other people on Yelp raved about it and I agree it was good. The fries were just okay. Both were covered in grease and I'm kind of shocked to see that at a vegan place. Sure it's \"southern comfort food\" but since when does everything have to be fried and greasy?",

They have a store of their menu delicacies available inside of the restaurant in the next room. I thought that was awesome!

    "text": "So I was super excited to bring my Omni friend to his first vegan restaurant. He was so excited to try some vegan food from a restaurant, and I had been raving to him about Bean. We literally were sitting in the parking lot for twenty minutes waiting for them to open. I have been there before and had the Reuben and the breakfast bowl. This time, I opted for the buffalo cauliflower bites for my entree and some queso dip before. The queso dip was okay. Nothing special. It was not a cheesy dip but more like a black bean dip from a jar. My cauliflower bites come out, and I take a small bite from one of them and then put it right back down. It was DRENCHED in oil. It was so oily it was inedible. The pictures I have posted really don't do it justice. I could have poured all of the oil into a glass to drink. It was not the buffalo sauce (which the owner tried to defend later on the phone from his other location), it was STRAIGHT UP OIL. So I begin looking over the menu to see what else I can get because I could not eat these. I tell the waitress about it and show her and the first words out of her mouth were, \"We don't do exchanges or refunds.\" I told her again that I could not eat them. They were drenched in oil to the point of being inedible. She said, \"well they look fine to me. I would eat them. I eat cauliflower bites all the time and they look fine.\" At this point, I am just frustrated with this server's response because this is no way to treat a guest. I asked for a manager. She said with a nice smug grin, \"I am the manager.\" It was honestly hilarious. She was so proud to announce that. She's the manager... but yet she's also serving the tables? Interesting. And also, how in the world did any mentally sound owner decide SHE should be the manager? She was the rudest person I've ever met. Guests always come first. This is food and bev 101. You take care of your guests, no matter what the issue may be. You don't say, \"they look fine to me. I would eat them.\" The least they could have done was remake them or give me an exchange of the same value. That's just poor business practice... They must be struggling financially. Anyways, she dropped the bill off and didn't take the cauliflower bites off and never offered any compensation. I sat there for like 20 minutes trying to figure out if I should pay or walk out. I ended up paying. So I found out the owner is currently at the other location in Asheville. I gave him a call to let him know, and he immediately went defensive. He said he would not do anything because I did not like his food. I explained over and over again that it's not that I didn't like his food, it's that it was inedible. He said there's nothing wrong with his food and the cauliflower bites are saucy. I told him it was definitely not the sauce, it was oil. This went on for about ten minutes and he just said he trusted his manager and he's not going to do anything. I said well thank you for your time but this is extremely disappointing, AND THE OWNER HUNG UP ON ME. How unprofessional. I will never return to Bean because of this awful experience. I will also continue to spread the word on the experience and the unprofessional and rude response from the management and owner.   Seriously Charlie, a no exchanges or refunds policy is ABSURD for food that is improperly cooked. I know you kept trying to say your food is properly cooked (even though you weren't there) but if a guest is so upset by an experience from your management that they feel the need to call you, you do something about it. I would be happy to send you some books on management 101 to your Asheville location.   TL;DR: buffalo cauliflower bites were drenched in oil and inedible. Very rude management said too bad no exchanges or refunds. I called owner because of the awful experience with his management and he defended them and said he won't do anything... and THEN HUNG UP THE PHONE ON ME. EXPECT TO GET RUDE MANAGEMENT AND SUBPAR FOOD IF YOU VISIT BEAN.",

Coupled with the fries - YUM.  We also ordered the Chicken & Waffles - I'm not the biggest fan of tofu acting as chicken, but when something is fried... it's hard to go wrong!  The waffle is something I'm going to try to recreate at home :)  Loved their posted stats about positive environmental impacts from eating vegan.   This is an odd location - right off of a highway!   Team here is very homely!",

The fries were fresh and flavorful as well as the burger.  The burger was obviously freshly assembled and the Seitan had a nice flavor and texture. Some Vegan restaurants can't get it right but they did and think their burger could rival and meat burger. I opted out of the Daiya cheeze just because I loathe the flavor and texture of Vegan cheezes. It just doesn't do it for me.  That's neither here nor there so don't mind my rambling! :-)  Go check them out, I did and was delighted.",

The staff were sweating profusely. Nobody brought out a fan or anything to make the situation better. Also it smelled of bad body hygiene and old garbage from the heat.   The wait staff were sweating over the food. There were a few waiters wearing flip flops (open toe). There was a waitress who dropped a fork on the floor, picked it up and wrapped it in a new napkin.   The food was subpar at best. It tasted like microwaved packaged food. I would never frequent this place again.",

If you are eating with someone who is not vegan and they want something fun (think: fried tofu fingers, fried pickle chips, queso dip, bacon cheeseburgers, etc.) this is the place to go. Raw, pretentious vegan food this is not.   i ordered the Crabbie salad, which was jackfruit mixed with Veganaise and Old Bay to make it taste like crab salad. The salad itself was great fresh greens and other veggies, and their Mega bean salad (which was probably my favorite part!). It also came with a tasty little corn muffin. Staff was super friendly, as were the other diners. I kind of wanted to try everything on the menu. Oh, they also had $4 glasses of wine!  Also, they have a small market in the back of the restaurant. You can get things like Dr. Macdougal's instant meals and vegan cheese.   The location is off a busy highway, not pedestrian friendly at all. Plenty of parking, though. Definitely a must visit for vegans, and tasty enough for those of us who are just open-minded.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. Will have to go back and see if they improve, because a vegan restaurant with a fun \"junk food\" menu has to survive.  1st the food: I give it 4 stars overall, most was very tasty. Hubby & daughter had the Build Your Own breakfast bowls that were super yummy. I had the chicken strips and waffle. The waffle was the best waffle I have had in my life. I don't know what made it so amazing, but it was tastier than the chicken strips, which had so much potential. The coating on the strips could have been the star, but it was really under-salted. Easily fixed with the shaker. The reuben was awesome, but could have had more meat. The tater-tot casserole sounded amazing, but wasn't--very bleh. The yellow squash was just ok.  The poor service gets a 2. This is easily corrected  (management, pay attention), so here goes. We arrived Mother's Day just after 10am. A petite friendly black waiter greeted us cheerily from the other side of the room, but alas, she was not our waiter. Kudos to her though for that greeting, and coming by later to check on us, even though we weren't her table. Give her a raise, because otherwise service would have been a 0.  Our waiter, a fair-skinned black girl with looong hair, placed our menus near the door between 2 tables of wiggly children. I asked if we could sit further from the door, and without answering,  she snatched up the menus walked to a further table, tossed the menus down, and walked off without even a glance back. Good service would be to look us in the eye at the new table and ask if the location was ok.  Ordering was awkward, as she now had a poor attitude, but we kept smiling at her to get her to relax. It was odd, when speaking she wouldn't look at us directly. Even when we left she mumbled, bye, have a nice day, never looking up from her napkins or whatever she was doing.   Have the short waitress train the others on how to smile and engage with customers. Fire anyone who is rude, and hire pleasant servers. Reading your reviews, you are losing customers because of your front staff and waiters.",

However; after my last few experiences I may not be going back. Their food is still amazing - but the truth is, you might not ever get to experience it. Their service is so poor, that this restaurant is one of the only places I have ever actually walked out without eating. My husband and I recently went in, sat down, and ordered. 50 minutes later we still did not receive our food. I patiently waited while I watched other people come and go. About 30 minutes in I tried to get our waitress' attention, but she didn't even turn to check in. Once 50 minutes rolled around we just got up, and walked out. No point in waiting around any longer.   If you do manage to get food, then I'm sure you will enjoy it. But; with the service lately - I doubt you will get to experience their cuisine. It really is a shame.",

We started with the outstanding fried pickles and the pimento cheese dip. They were both yummy. Then my cousin and I shared the Reuben and the bratwurst with sides of collards and tater tot casserole. The collards has a really nice sweetness to them. I really enjoyed the Reuben. I have had many vegan reubens and this one was very good.   I had not had a proper meal in days so I also had a cup of the vanilla soft serve which was super cheap at $2 and really tasty.   If Bean were closer to my hotel I would have gone everyday. Loved it.",

We were so excited to come back today but today's experience changed that completely!  the pathetic excuse for servers didn't even say anything but \"dining in or take out?\" When we entered. She didn't even ask us to follow her to a table.  She walked to a table with menus and we had to ask if we were supposed to follow her as we weren't 100% sure if she was seating us or not.  This place should not be running just because the customer service aspect of it sucks so horribly. Horrible horrible horrible service! Horrible I can't even begin to express how horrible the service is there. We got up and left after a good 10 minutes of nobody coming to our table.  No greeting, no anything.  Sad and pathetic establishment!!!  No clue how it's lasted as long as it has.",

As someone who spends most of their restaurant life struggling to find things I can eat, it is very liberating being at a place with not only a huge and diverse menu, but a small grocery area as well. The service was super fast, polite, and amazing. If I could bring this place to Raleigh, I totally would. If you are reading this and live in Charlotte, please check out this gem.",

They describe themselves as down home vegan fare and that is exactly what they are.   This place is great for lunch or dinner one of my favorite dishes is the \"meatloaf\" which comes with corn bread and two sides. I love the tater tot casserole, green been casserole and the three bean salad but all of their sides are great.  Along with the restaurant they have a small vegan grocery story which is very handy. One of my favorite thing is that the place is decked out in comic book/ super hero decor.  If you have not checked this place out next time you are looking for some great vegan food that a lot of people would not realize is  meat and dairy free head over the Bean!",

    "text": "Although the food here is AMAZING, the terrible customer service I just received here will cause me to never come back. I walked into a fairly empty restaurant in Sunday afternoon.  I proceeded to place my order with the pleasant girl behind the counter. The girl comes back moments after I placed my order to tell me they couldn't honor my request for my onion rings to be on the side of my burger. I was confused by this so I ask her is there any particular reason why? The manager/owner comes from around the corner to tell me there isn't enough space in the Togo box to put them on the side. I was even more confused. I ask the manager, can I have them in a separate container or in one of my other boxes? He said NO I'm not going to do that you can either get it on the burger or not at all. And I simply replied that I still want the onion rings to put on my burger, but I want them on the side to add myself later. He proceeded to give me more sass about ordering the burger the way it's supposed to come, told me he wasn't going to argue with me, and walked away. The sweet girl asked me if I still wanted the burger on my order. Before I could even answer her, he comes back around the corner and says have a good day. I replied I'm not getting my order now? He says you don't want the food how it comes so you can have a good day. After all of the drama of course I decide to just leave while he kept sassing me all the way out of the door. For one, I have never been to a restaurant that has flat out denied my request to have my sauces and/or condiments on the side. I've worked in restaurants for over 10 years and I expect sass from servers and bartenders from time to time, but the owner of a restaurant giving a customer such a problem for wanting to spend money in their business is insane. I hope that he was just having a bad day today and this isn't his typical response to customers. I would never say that the food here isn't amazing, because it is. But steer clear of this guy. And snaps for the sweet girl I don't know how you do it.",

I hate a tofu scramble with mushrooms, peppers/onions, and \"sausage\" with a biscuit; split a plain waffle; partner had a brunch bowl. We loved the food! Biscuits were amazing, food was flavorful, and the tofu scramble was one of the best I've ever had. However, no one refilled our drinks in the 40 minutes we were there, and the staff seemed angry when we asked for waters and refills with our check. The space is pretty worn down and unimpressive, and inconvenient to get to. But if you want good vegan food, and you're okay being a little thorn-in-side with your waiter, I highly recommend it.",

They thought the reason we were upset was because we didn't get a discount. We were upset due to the lack of respect and care the manager showed. She thought we were going to eat the rest of the food as if the hair didn't mess up our appetite. She said, \"Well, there wasn't hair on the other food.\" You may like dirty food but we don't. I worked in the food service industry and know that these folks don't care about their customers. It's pretty sad if you ask me. The manager is a reflection of what the owners project onto their customers in addition to the overall appearance of the place. It's all in the presentation. It's dark, dreary and did and filthy.

The bean bowls went up from $13 to $13.99, burgers and sides went up a dollar as well. The sizes went down like half of what they used to be but I have to pay more? No thanks. Bean' is not like some upscale restaurant, but their prices are. I can get a bowl of vegan food at Luna's for $14 and have the most upscale dining experience with great staff. Lately, their service really went down the hill. If you order \"to go\", make sure you check your order as they will not reimburse or offer you a new meal.  They literally had my friend come back with a messed up order, where they forgot to add the rice to her order, just to give her a small bowl of rice to her already cold food. The waitress then smart lipped her, that it's her job to check her order before leaving. This happened about a month ago. The owners are questionable, one of them is super rude while the other one who works in the kitchen is really nice.The food is good, their burgers and bowls are great, but when the overall dining experience is in question, I rather not visit. I hesitated making writing this because I really don't like to give local businesses a bad review but when the owners get to greedy and start to overcharge you, incl. having some not up to par wait staff, then you are digging your own hole.  Charlotte is a growing city and before long, new Vegan Restaurants will pop up!",

I have also tried the \"soy curls\" BBQ and it was very good. One thing that really impresses me is that they make onion rings from scratch! Almost nobody does that anymore.

Having moved from Colorado recently, where there was an abundance of great options to choose from, I can say that I was disappointed that this restaurant represents most of the vegan offerings in Charlotte.  The restaurant was dirty -- I kid you not, there were multiple cockroaches in the bathroom the first time I went, and the food overall was pretty bland.  I've only had a few side dishes that I'd recommend -- the cauliflower \"wings\" & the collard greens.   Despite this, I've been back on a few different occasions still to give it a second and third chance (what can I say, I'm pretty optimistic), but I left with the same impression each time.   I'm sure I'll be back at some point because there's just a lack of vegan options in Charlotte, and if I ever have a better food experience there I'll be happy to update this review.  But for now... if you're looking for stellar vegan restaurants, you're better off heading up to Asheville -- they have some awesome food there!",

    "text": "I've never written a restaurant review in my life but I will take the time to share my experience at Bean Vegan Cuisine. I'm no food critic, however I am a vegan and some places aren't fit for the vegan restaurant industry. First off, let's not ignore the sanitation rate; afterall, this is a Vegan Cuisine. During my first encounter I noticed that a lot  of the servers spent more time on their phones than checking on their tables or tidying up the place. They will literally pick your food up after toying with their cell phones. My server wasn't conscientious, she stayed on her phone majority of the time and was gossiping to the front house manager about a table of customers. I couldn't help but overhear the two ladies because they didn't bother lowering their voices to share their rude comments. I minded my business and waited until they were finished to ask for more water. By the end of my meal, I honestly think my server forgot about me so I went to the register to pay for my food and left. The food was decent but not as good as I expected and definitely not worth the wait. Sometime later I thought to give it another try but I got the same results. I won't share the entire experience but I'm convinced that the reviews on this place has to be older and I can imagine this place turnover rate or even management. There seems to be a majority of minority workers there and I do not see an issue with that being that I'm of the same however I can sense that the workers are poorly paid which could be the reason for poor service and lack of cleanliness. Being that it's a small owned business, I don't understand why it needs more attention but in some cases, owners and workers become lazy. I tried this place twice and both times I felt terrible afterwards. A bad case of itis, nausea, and sluggishness which is a very rare affect after eating vegan food. I would definitely put this restaurant in the category with fast food and recommend that they retrain their servers and raise their sanitation score before I eat there again.",

We have been here twice in the last month or so, and the food NEVER disappoints!  I will say, please be prepared to wait for a little bit for your food, as they prepare EVERYTHING fresh as it's ordered. I think the longest we have waited was around 45 minutes for our main entrees. However, our last visit was much better and a litlte bit faster.  If they have them on the special, PLEASE get the cauliflower bites. That is a meal in itself. They use giant florets of cauliflower, and batter them and fry them. I've tried making them at home and they do not compare to the ones at Bean!  The fried tofu sticks are AMAZING. They can use quite a few different sauces to tend to your desire. The fried yellow squash is always fantastic and crispy. I have tried the \"mac n cheese\" however it is very bland, I might skip on that next time. But all of the other sides seemed like they would be delicious and would compliment any sandwich.  My boyfriend always gets the Cowboy burger with the seitan bacon added to it, and he is always full and satisfied every time.  I do recommend this place to any vegetarian, new vegans, or long time vegans. It's a nice place with a huge selection of delicious food.  ALSO, they have an ALL-VEGAN market on the other side of the restaurant inside. So anything you might have a hard time finding at other places, please grab it from here! I use the egg-replacement powder in so many of my baking and cooking recipes that I used to use with eggs. They have a lot to pick from, grab a few things for sure, you won't be disappointed!",

The associate there talked up the soy curls, and even though I didn't buy any at the time, she gave me a recipe sheet. I was intrigued. So, I decided to try the salad bowl topped with spicy soy curls and a side of blue cheesish dressing.  Unbelievably good.  That salad was loaded with every vegetable possible, including tofu and blackeyed peas.  And the soy curls?  Yummy chewiness with a nice spice.  We also shared fried pickles and Southern style fried tofu with their version of Ranch dressing.  We all loved the crispy, not greasy appetizers.  The guys got the jackfruit tacos and were both impressed.  The hard core carnivore said, \"I never thought that vegan food could be so good.\" And, you know what I did?  I marched back in their store and bought some soy curls.  Let's hope that I can do them as much justice.",

    "text": "We've been wanting to try out Bean for awhile now since we've seen it driving 60 mph down Independence Blvd.  (I know what you're thinking: 60 mph down Independence?  What a joke.  It's actually more like 6 mph.  On a good day.)   Let's face it.  I'm never going to stop eating meat.  I don't overdo it, but I do like it.  Similarly, a few times a week, I do try to eat a veggie-only meal or three.  We had previously tried Fern in Charlotte and, while the food and service were good, it was quite pricey for a non-meat meal and the options seemed limited.    This past Sunday evening, we finally decided was when we'd give Bean a try.  Bean doesn't have the \"date night\" or \"night out on the town\" ambiance and decor that you'd want for a Friday or Saturday night dining experience, but it does have that weekday evening or lunch feel to it.  So, for us, Sunday evening was just as good.  We were relieved there were other people there dining besides us and were actually surprised at how much nicer the interior was than I expected (from the photos I've seen posted on Yelp).  Almost every table is a window table, and there's also a very long bar with stools where you can watch TV or enjoy looking at the posed superhero action figures on the shelf (woot woot!).    The next thing that I was pleasantly surprised to find was the number of choices on the menu!  There were apps, salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  And all of them were very affordable, even for dinner, making this a restaurant that you could come back to over and over again and it wouldn't blow your budget.    So many options sounded good, but for my first dining experience at Bean, I went with the Buffalo Tofu Finger Sandwich.  There were lots of Buffalo sauce-coated fingers and plenty of toppings.  Tastes like chicken!  The vegan Ranch dressing that came with it was very delicious, too.  It was similar to regular Ranch but possibly even better because of it's distinctly different flavor.  The sandwiches come with a side (there's a variety of side options), so I opted for the grilled zucchini, which were basically plain with limited seasoning but very flavorful.  Would I get this sandwich again?  You bet.  But not until I try a few other items on the menu that whet my appetite.   My partner ordered the Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos.  Upon seeing it on the menu, he first said, \"What's a jackfruit?\"  I replied, \"That's so weird!  If it's what I'm thinking of, I just saw and touched one down at the Super G International supermarket up the street!\"  It was about the size of a watermelon with a big green scaly skin.  We then looked it up on Wikipedia to confirm.  Sure enough, when the fruit is ripe, it's like a fruit, when it's unripe, it's like a meat.  Who knew?    We had just returned from San Antonio.  The Jackfruit Carnitas Tacos looked like the Mexican street tacos that we had just eaten on vacation.  I tried a bit of the \"meat\" and it really did seem meatlike and tasted similar to grilled chicken.    Everything seemed very fresh that they served, the restaurant was clean, and the service was friendly.  It was much better than I was prepared for.  For vegan or vegetarian food, Bean is at the top of my list for Charlotte.  It's delicious, there is a big variety of choices, and it's completely affordable.  It's not in the best part of town (and it's a little scary getting onto Independence Blvd after dining), but I highly recommend it for a healthy, flavorful alternative to a meaty meal.  It's good for small and big appetites.  (There's even brunch and kiddie menus!)",

My dad wanted to get lunch here and I agreed, pretty good choice I must say. It had a mom & pop old diner style feel when you get inside and sit down. There was planets of seating options but not many people actually eating or occupying the space. We were seated right away and given drinks and menus. The menu was pretty wide range for a 100% vegan spot. From soups, to salads, to burgers, to pastas. Usually when I eat out I opt for a salad but since this place was vegan, I new I needed to try a burger because plant based burgers are pretty hard to nail and I thought I could get a True vegan experience. I got the fried pickles as an appetizer, cowboy burger and side of Mac and cheese for my entre. It was honestly phenomenal. Better than any regular burger I've ever had (I don't have them that often anyways). The Mac and cheese was a little d i f f e r e n t i will say, an acquired taste mainly, but still damn good for completely plant based. I will definitely be back and bring my carnivorous boyfriend next time too!!",

Some of the service reviews I read here could have been solved by getting off a mighty horse or tuning the eater's attitude a bunch (there are those bad days, though, that any restaurant can have) but tonight was just fine... Next!  As a  non-vegan I like to tip my toes in the genre and explore. This thing called jackfruit blows me away and tucked into a BBQ taco screws with the cerebral synapses... Tres interessant. You have to buy the fried zukes and cauliflower. Sure, there's more oil used here than the Valdez wreck but it's simply delicious.  Yes, I'll be back... The best review that a restaurant can have...",

    "text": "My Go to for yummy Vegan lunch in a chill atmosphere and family friendly. I stumbled across Bean sometime ago but it took me a minute to review as I wanted to ensure consistency.  This place upon approach could come off as a \"Meh\" place but once you try the food you will be super pleased. The Bean menu is pretty entail with explanation in detail of the various forms of plant protein mentioned in various dishes.   The kids menu is cute and simple our son has had both options the cheese quesadilla and the Tofu nuggets. He enjoys both very well at the age of 2 and now 3.   My husband and I FAV burger is The Cowboy burger. My husband is more stuck on that burger than I am as I like to try other offerings (he had had that burger all 6-7 visits). I also enjoy the Jalepeno cheddar burger, the Rueben and the veggie quesadilla.  Bonus: You can shop Vegan  after eating at the attached convenience store. The store is stocked with items I order online due to the in availability of them for the most part in stores. I was so happy to see that I can purchase the items here.  Overall I enjoy Bean and the customer service which is hit or miss but when it's MISS there tends to be someone else that notices and try to assist.",

Unfortunately, I read many negative reviews on various sites regarding the lack of customer service and the area/atmosphere of the restaurant. We almost didn't go because of the comments. We wanted to have a great first night out and for it to be special!   BEAN did not disappoint. At all. We were greeted upon arrival. The waiter was very attentive and we ordered based on his recommendations. We had the fried cauliflower, cowboy burgers, and chocolate cake and it was all absolutely delicious. Several other staff members came by to pick up dishes, ask if we needed anything, and to pick up our check. Everyone was friendly and helpful!   I love that BEAN is not one of those fancy, overly priced snobby vegan restaurants. I don't care about organic kale and stuffed avocados. We eat healthy vegan food at home most of the time. If you want great southern comfort food, you need to go to BEAN!   It REALLY is good, ya'll!",

I mean your cheese tasted like cheese. Your burger had a consistency that made me forget I wasn't eating meat. The fried jalapenos really threw me off. I may just have to become a Vegan.   Sike nah, that's not happening, but I'm seriously considering it, with all the shat they put in food these days.   I'm typically open to eating all types of food and I had good reason to eat at this place with my brother (who is vegan) in town.   That jalapeno burger was extremely delicious. I seriously thought I was eating real cheese. They used Daiya cheese and my brother couldn't believe it. He said he's had the cheese before after purchasing from maybe Whole Foods, and when he opened the package, he said it smelled like fart. No lie.   I don't know what Bean did but they did good.   The crunchy jalapenos was a nice touch and I'm not exactly sure what the patty was made out of but it had similar consistency to a bean burger. I wasn't too thrilled about the fries. Not my style. And the \"ranch\" was okay but was definitely better after mixing it with the ketchup. I think it just needed more salt.   My brother thoroughly enjoyed his burger. He talked about it all weekend. Like, ALL WEEKEND!   If you're vegan, you'll love this place and if you're not, like me, you'll love this place.",

They have so many options, and many of them are customizable to fit exactly what you are craving. I ended up getting the 'Bean Bowl' with BBQ tofu in it. DELISH!

I returned today for the first time in two years and everything was just poorer quality. The service was atrocious, a first for us at Bean. We were forgotten about, not receiving a single refill on our drinks, after it took more than fifteen minutes for us to receive them initially when we ordered. Our food took forever, and our waiter never checked in on us, we had to flag him down just to get the check.  As for our meal, I got the cheesesteak, it bun was not as good, less seitan and it was smaller than it used to be. My husband got the jalapeno burger, which barely had any jalapenos. They are using a different ranch dressing which was flavorless and flat. We had really high hopes given the years of good service and delicious food we had gotten in previous years, before our move, but we were absolutely disappointed, especially considering it is over an hour's drive to get there for us now. Definitely will not be going back given other reviewers have also complained about awful service, which was the biggest issue for us.",

When they came back without the sauce, she couldn't eat them because they were extremely bland. I agreed and without the green sauce, I don't think I could have eaten them either. Despite not being able to eat them, she was still forced to pay for the tacos.  The service is really what let me down. Apart from the person who took our order, no one checked on us. We had to catch their eye any time we needed something despite it not being especially busy. They forgot my friend's smoothie and cheesecake.

    "text": "The food is typically good, but the service has been terrible at times.  I don't typically leave bad reviews, but the most recent visit irritated me enough to feel the need to leave one.    This most recent visit was with my girlfriend on my birthday.  Everything was fine when being seated and ordering our drinks and food.  After ordering our food, we received our appetizer fine.  Shortly after, a different waitress came with my girlfriend's food, sat it down and then kind of gave me a questioning look and asked if I had ordered something too.  I told her yes, and she went back to the order/computer, where are original waitress already was.  I could hear them talking, and heard \"..... was going on, so I completely forgot to put it in....\".  Hey, ok, cool -- that happens, not a big deal.    Well, while my girlfriend started eating, I waited for about 10 minutes and my original waitress still had not come over to let us know what had happened.  The waitress that had brought over our food eventually came by the table, told us what happened and apologized.    Eventually my food had finally came out, albeit missing the side of ranch that I had ordered along with it.  I told the waitress, and she ran back to the kitchen area, presumably to get the ranch.  I start eating my burger, and hold off for a couple minutes for my side of ranch for the fries.  Well, another 5 or so minutes pass, so I said fine, and just started eating my fries as well.  I had complete time to finish my meal, pack the rest of my girlfriend's food in a to-go box, and get the check from the waitress that had originally dropped off our food.    As I was filling in the check, the original waitress comes over with a side of ranch in a plastic cup, and kind of looks around befuddled as to what I need the ranch for since.  I said that yeah, it took too long, I'm done eating and don't need the ranch anymore. She kind of got snippy and said \"well, we already put it in the cup so let me get you a lid to take it home because it's already on your check\".  So she ran off to get the lid I guess, and when she came back I told her that the ranch had taken 10 minutes to get, after i had finally received my food, which was after I had watched my girlfriend eat, because she forgot to put the order in and not even have the courtesy to tell us, and you still expect me to pay for the ranch?    She gave some mumblings about how the kitchen was busy and blah blah blah, and didn't take it off the check and gave us a \"you still have to pay for it\" kind of attitude.  Ok, so let me get this straight -- you forgot to put in my order, didn't tell us that you forgot to put in my order, the food finally comes WITHOUT the ranch that I had ordered, and you send a simple side of ranch to the BEGINNING of the kitchen line instead of telling the kitchen that you need it rushed for an already late order?  Either way, I gave the first $0 tip in my life and left the ranch.  This entire situation would have been fine and we would have left happy if just two things had happened...  1. Told us what had happened with my order.  Since I overheard her talking, I knew what had happened, but she didn't know that.  Have the courtesy to come to the table, explain and apologize.   2. If you had forgotten the ranch for my already late order, go back have the kitchen rush it.  Seriously, this isn't that hard of a concept and it's how things always seem to be done at every other restaurant I've ever been to.  But ok, you didn't do that.  Cool.  Even not having the ranch for my meal wasn't that big of a deal.  But after it arrived 10-15 minutes later, you should have apologized (again?) and be proactive and take it off the check.  So look, the food is good when you're in the mood for greasy vegan soul food.  I've had some issues with the service, with this one being the worst.  I have seen numerous mentions of many others having issues with the service as well.  After this one though, I definitely won't be returning and instead will go to the many other killer vegan options in CLT.  (Thank you to the waitress that was actually helpful during this visit!)",

She looked worried and mumbled that she would ask the manager.  She shortly came back smiling and  said \"No, we can't do that\".  I said ok assuming they're undercapitalized.  She later asked if I wanted to box the squash.  Very irritating.  Then the manager came over and asked if we needed anything else,smiling weirdly.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I being (and becoming) devoted vegetarians, we definitely wanted to try this place, and it did not stay on our list long before we ended up going there.  The outside, as my girlfriend had mentioned in the past, does not look like anything special for sure (it has a dull brown color and is right on the side of a large, fast-moving road.  They do say location is everything, but at the same time, you cannot always be as lucky as you wish to be in picking a spot for your establishment.  Walking into this place, there was a little bit of a weird vibe, but nothing we could not handle (we are all weird in our own ways).  I guess the owner of this place really likes superheroes and such, because there is memorabilia everywhere, on every surface.  Needless to say, it felt pretty weird sitting there with all of the figurines next to us, without much of an explanation from the owner (they could have come around and explained it, and I would have been much more interested).  I am not a stickler for professionalism by any means, but everyone in this place was wearing whatever they wanted to, and our server had the brightest white frames on his glasses, making it hard to really take much of the experience seriously.  For the fact that there were not many tables in this establishment, I thought that the service was relatively slow (contrary to when I had called a couple of weeks before and the person on the other end of the phone had said that they turn over tables pretty quickly).  Again, there was ample time for someone to come by and explain the place, its mission, why it looked the way it looked, etc.  I am pretty sure that I saw (who I thought was) the owner talking to a bunch of other parties, but we hardly saw him.  The server seemed a little delayed when we ordered the food, like he was unsure of what we were ordering or something.  We had a priority, which was figuring out what did and did not have nuts in it, for my girlfriend is allergic to them, and that would have instantly been a deal-breaker.  First, our server did not have much to say about it, and suggested we just order and go from there (not the worst suggestion ever, as it is what I may say where I work as well).  Who we thought to be the owner also came over, but his help was even less reassuring (\"yeah guys, we do use peanuts...\" not \"how can I make sure you enjoy my business as well as everyone else?\").  The food we ended up ordering was pretty great, I wold have to say.  For being vegan, it is pretty impressive that they could pull off a flavorful cowboy burger, barbecue chicken fingers, and fried pickles (although they left a lot to be desired, and the portion was HUGE).  The food was exactly how it looked on the website, which was helpful and satisfying, and the taste really was great.  In being consistent with the rest of the reviews I have done, I have given this establishment this rating based mostly upon their food quality, but there is much to be said about the service.  It definitely made the mood difficult to explain at best.  I am also attributing at least some of the mood to the fact that we may have been in a little bit of a sour mood while we were there.  Thus, I have tried to be as objective as possible in writing this review, but I do not know if we will be going back.  Although we ordered a lot to try (exactly how I wanted it), the food definitely costs a fair amount, and I cannot say right now if it is worth it for us to return.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I LOVE the food at Bean. Despite the restaurants slightly lackluster appearance, the food is absolutely incredible. It's a vegan southern comfort food heaven, and it's such an awesome thing to go into a restaurant and not worry if what I'm eating is actually vegan. I haven't tried a menu item that I didn't love, and it is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Highly recommend any of the burgers, the BBQ jackfruit sandwich, the chips and queso, the pimento cheese, the bean bowl, and the tofu fingers! However the customer service is the reason I'm giving this restaurant a 3 star rating. There are a few regular servers who are amazing and very sweet, but bean staff need a briefing on dealing with customers ASAP.    When eating in the restaurant, expect to be there for 1.5 to 2 hours. Usually the wait for a table is excessive due to the consistent understaffing. Several times I've come in, only to wait 30-45 minutes for a table (mind, this is while there are several tables open, just not enough servers) then 45 minutes to an hour for food. Don't try to eat here on a Saturday, there are usually only one or two servers working the whole restaurant and service is unbearably slow, not through any fault of the wait staff. However its fairly common for water or drinks to be sitting empty and not refilled in a timely manner, and several staff over the past few years have been rude and inattentive.   When ordering take out, there is usually an issue. Once a staff member forgot to put our order in the system so we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for our food after called 30 minutes previously. We have also called before and the phone has been off the hook for over 30 minutes due to staff negligence. At one point we had placed a to-go order and after waiting almost an hour, my husband asked the manager who was at the counter politely how much longer it would be. He received a rude and aggressive response in turn. Our order has been put into the system wrong on several occasions and we have had to wait for it to be fixed. The \"pickup time\" is always 10-15 minutes, even on a night when they're slammed, but you'll still have to wait longer than that for your food.  None of these issues have been rectified in any way other than an apology. We have never received a discount for a long wait, never offered something in return for our food being forgotten, or never even offered a drink while we wait over 20 minutes for food. We at one point asked if we could have a discount or a complimentary dish due to the excessive wait time, but were told that staff didn't have the authority to do so, only managers (none were in the store at that time).  All of these issues don't outweigh the deliciousness of the food for us, at least not yet. We continue to eat at Bean because of the quality of the food, and the few staff members there that are friendly. However the customer service desperately need improvement. There is a large employee turnover rate, no repercussions we have seen for poor service, no emphasis on customer service, and we believe it comes down to management. We have eaten at the Bean Vegan Cuisine in Asheville several times and have never had an issue. The staff at that location have always been friendly, the service quick and efficient, and the restaurant well maintained. We would hate for such a wonderful local vegan spot to get a bad reputation and suffer for such an easily fixed issue. Management - please take this review seriously, as it comes from a loyal Bean customer who wants you to succeed but is very close to giving up completely.",

The only downside is that service can be a little slow and it might feel like your food takes forever -- but keep in mind that the wait means your food is being prepared as ordered and will be fresh. Still, the wait is killer when you're hungry. Good place for kids -- they even tape up their artwork on a wall in the waiting area!",

I've been vegan for a little more than a year and have been eating here for the same time frame. This restaurant has the BEST food. I usually always end up eating the Jalapeno Cheddar burger because it's soooooo good, their chorizo dip is delicious too. The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing, they have music playing in the background at just the right volume. They also have an attached mini store next to the restaurant giving you access to vegan foods to take home with you. I've been there about 10 times with my friends and boyfriend, some are vegan some aren't but we can all agree the food is delicious. My absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte!",

I'm a university student and we're not allowed to have cars on campus so I usually rely on delivery. That being said, I've gotten food delivered from there twice. The first time, I got the cheeseburger thing alongside Mac and cheese, gravy, and the raspberry cake. I loved both of my sides and the cake but the burger just wasn't my style or what I was expecting. The second time around, I got their make your own scramble where I added sausage, cheese, and mushrooms and it actually wasn't that bad though admittedly I wish they used another brand rather than daiya cheese and the sausage was pretty spicy. I also ordered for dinner as well, because today was just one of those days where I didn't want to go to the cafeteria and got their tofu fingers combo where I got to choose two sides and I actually really liked that. I will continue going back for their desserts, especially when I am in a sweet mood but I will avoid their burgers in the future. I LOVE THAT THEY ARE ALL VEGAN THOUGH, the fact that I don't have to worry and triple check that it's vegan and that everything is fine is such a stress relief and I love it so much.",

    "text": "I am not vegan but my sister is vegetarian and is a regular here at Bean. I've tried a handful of vegan restaurants in my life and by far Bean is one of the top. Obviously I'm not a vegan so I may not be the best judge of vegan cuisine but I felt that Bean did a great job with imitation meats, cheese, butter and all around non vegan items. I've been here a few times and the service is always friendly and the food is always fresh and up to par.  To start, we ordered Fried Tofu Fingers as an appetizer with Teriyaki flavor on one side and the Korean BBQ flavor on the other along with ranch dipping sauce. It came with celery as well. The Fried Tofu Fingers were the best part of the meal!! My sister who has tried most of the menu as a regular also believes the fried tofu fingers to be the best thing on the entire menu. She also believes that the tofu finger sandwich is the best entree. The teriyaki flavoring for the fried tofu fingers was our personal favorite and had a perfect balance of savory and sweet. The korean BBQ is also decently flavorful and the ranch dipping sauce balanced the entire appetizer. Their ranch is also better than any other restaurant's ranch that I've had. You usually don't hear from meat eaters like me proclaiming the best ranch is actually vegan ranch but I stand by this 100%. They also sell their ranch in the front area in packets so you can use it at home since it's actually made in house.     I ordered The Cheesesteak Hoagie for $11.99 which was a good price for how big and filling the hoagie is. The hoagie is loaded with (fake) cheese and veggies and tasty sauces which I loved. It's exactly what you would expect out of a good, hearty cheesesteak hoagie. While the cheesesteak hoagie did not disappoint, my personal favorite from their menu will always be their Cowboy Burger at $12.99.   My sister enjoyed the Bacon Cheeseburger as well but she prefers the Jalapeno Cheddar Burger the most, along with the tofu finger sandwich.   Overall Bean has lots of good options and variety if you're looking for some Vegan burgers and sandwiches. From the ones I've tried, they've never disappointed and it's honestly super super impressive that it's actually vegan because it does taste JUST LIKE REAL MEAT. Honestly the awful drive on the side of the freeway is worth it for some good vegan comfort food.",

This was one of the most delicious and filling vegan, gluten free breakfasts I've had. It consisted of these delicious BBQ soy curls over cheesy grits with kale and a corn muffin. The soy curls had a nice texture to go with the creamy grits which you could not tell had vegan cheese. This was super filling I could only eat about half of it. I enjoyed the breakfast so much I decided to come again for dinner. I got the jalapeno cheddar burger since I love vegan burgers and spice. The burger patty was good but not anything special. I did love the toppings which included vegan cheddar cheese and fried jalapeno chips. Will definitely come back if I'm in Charlotte again.",

The menu has a lot of different and unique options and a bunch of different takes on vegan burgers that are filling and have great texture (would easily fool any meat eater!). The cookies and cream milkshake is delicious. I had the old fashioned cheeseburger with chili on it and it was filling and delicious. The bean bowl with any style of cauliflower or tofu strips is also a good combo of healthy and filling! This is the kind of place to try out if you're intimidated by eating vegan!",

My husband eats ALL kinds of food. I only eat chicken and mostly vegetarian products. We have heard lots of our friends and clients talk about this establishment so we figured we would give it a try.   The restaurant is extremely decorative on the inside. Very cute. The staff was welcoming and we were never rushed when we would tell our waiter that we need more time to look over their menu.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fried squash. My husband ordered the Ruben sandwich with a side of greens.   We both loved our sides! The fried squash was amazing and my husband ate the greens so quickly I couldn't even try them. We how ever did not like the sandwiches. It was not for us.   I have been trying to figure out how to write a review for this place. Nothing went wrong. Our experience was fun. The staff was nice. The restaurant was clean and relaxing. Everyone seemed to be enjoying there food. Lots of smiles all around.   I didn't want to bash a place because we didn't like the TYPE of food they provided. We KNEW going in that it was VEGAN. We knew it would be hit or miss... I didn't think it would be fair to give low stars because that's not how it's done.   Thank you for the experience Vegan Bean.",

Think tofu scramble, potatoes, grits, carrot bacon, and a biscuit. The Herc bowl is more savory and at first glance doesn't seem like a breakfast-brunchy type of dish - bbq soy curls, spicy mayo, and kale? But oh my goodness, it's so good! I also get extra carrot bacon on the side because I'm obsessed with it.   The service has been perfectly adequate but nothing to write home about. The building itself seems a little dinghy and like it hasn't been well cared for. For example, the floor is quite sticky when you walk in. For me, this is what keeps this review from 5 stars.   That being said, I love Bean and plan on returning every time I'm in Charlotte.",

The only down side was the server was in a rush because she was serving everyone in the restaurant. I spent $50 and we got 2 meals with sides and 2 appetizers. They could definitely use a second server in the restaurant, or keep only server focusing on customers so we don't feel neglected and rushed.

My partner absolutely loves the Rueben. The fried tofu fingers are good, but I personally prefer a meat substitute like tempeh to really soak up the wing sauce flavor throughout. The only recommendation I have is for a makeover of the actual space, which looks like an old abandoned Italian restaurant.",

Now, the fishless fish tacos made with Jack Fruit is outstanding and if anyone wants to give a go I will gladly return for those bad boys. Navy Beans with rosemary is spot on also. The tatter tot casserole is a liar and in no way represents tatter tots. All and all \"Eh\" is the best I can give at this point. Not the cheapest place either but keep in mind they're making meat replacements with other foods some of which is exotic so...",

    "text": "Sorry. Cannot recommend. Call me Yanks or whatever but Southern Food DOES NOT all have to be greasy fatty fried food! Gees, I begged my family to take me to this place for Mother's Day, not sure what I was thinking. But as the \"foodie\" and vegan that I am, I really wanted to give it a try. Especially with that awesome name!!! Unfortunately, we were all so disappointed! We ordered around 5 different dishes. They all were super greasy, they were all soaked in heavy sauces of vegan cheeses and creams, their vegan burger left much to desire and think about. Not sure what vegan cheese brand they use but the American cheese flavor in the burger had such an off taste and there was a weird sweet taste to the burger. The rice and bean dish was also disappointing, the beans tasted like they were straight poured from a can. The fried pickles were super super super soaked in grease and they were spicy hot which caught us by surprise. Now as I am super fair, one thing we loved was how nice they all were! I didn't have the heart to complaint at the moment (nor wanted to completely ruin Mother's Day), so we just let it passed and as it was my first visit on a busy holiday I give them the benefit of doubt. I am still open for maybe a second visit, yes that's the mercy in me not my mind side. I simply cannot believe they have such poor quality and still keep open and busy. Oh one last thing, the cleanness of the place in overall left much to desire. I'm all earthy, kind of granola hippie friendly, but if you're a female waiter and choose to leave your underarm hair grow (or even a male) please do NoT crop your T-shirt and expose your hairy underarm while serving and reaching plates over a table! That's just common sense... just saying. Hoping to have another type of review next time around. I am going to give them a chance!",

The Cowboy burger is one of my favorites though I've had several other burger or sandwich options that I've enjoyed in recent months. The veggie appetizers and sides are just as good, collard greens, squash, cauliflower, etc. are mainstays for me. It's my \"go to\" place in Charlotte for vegan food.

Campbell Kentucky and she wanted to enjoy some vegan cuisine.  Before we got in the building, we looked for a trash can to throw away my 6 year olds Lunchable trash. All that was in the Lunchable container was cheese. But this establishment has no trash can outdoors.   We read the sign that reads, \"no outside food or drink\" . & Since nobody was eating the cheese & we were just looking for a trash can I took the container inside to look for a inside trash can.  While looking for a trash can (which there were none anywhere in sight) we walked all the way up to the counter to ask the manager where a trash can was located.  Before I could even open my mouth to ask him he looked at me and instead of saying hello he said, \"Hmph, (while shaking his head) ma'am we don't allow outside food in this establishment!\"  I kindly explained to him that I was looking for a trash can. He said it didn't matter, & that we can't bring anything in at all.  I was astonished! I explained to him that we just need a trash can! A garbage! (I said politely & didn't yell)  He said, \"so\"...it didn't matter.  I said to him, \"Sir it's only cheese!\" He said, \"We're a vegan restaurant.\" I said, \"& that's why we're throwing it out\"  He took the trash from me, but not after explaining to  me that they are a Vegan only environment  (which I understand) but it was freaking T-R-A-S-H ! LOL   Anyways, we finally ordered our to-go order ... & an hour later, after seeing people come in after us, sit down, and eat, tip & leave, we asked for our money back.  One stinking server came & asked our name for our to-go order. But she never came back with an update or anything!   The manager tried to explain to us that the people who we saw come in after us, had ordered over the phone & then just happen to see an open seat & sat down.   & that was the reason they came in after us & sat down & left before us.   But at this point, an hour later we dgaf, we wanted out money back.   & not once did they apologize, or offer a discount or a coupon.  The manager rude af! I'm NEVER eating here EVER again!!!!!!!",

    "text": "It is with great disappointment that I write this review regarding Bean Vegan Cuisine.  I attempted to contact the restaurant to speak to a manager before writing this review; however, the attendant who answered the phone informed me that, \"There are no managers, only owners, and the owners are not in right now.\"  She also didn't know when they would be in.  So the only option I'm left with is to voice my dissatisfaction on social media.    I've been a vegan for over 20 years.  I moved to Charlotte from Atlanta in 2011 and always enjoyed going to Bean Vegan Cuisine for takeouts and to dine in.  I live in Albemarle now and don't always get a chance to visit as often as I used to.  So when a friend decided to meet me there for lunch on Wednesday, May 10, 2017, I was excited.  When we walked in, one of the servers (perhaps one of the owners) sat us down at a table.  He didn't take our drink orders, but no problem.  Though my friend is health conscious, he's somewhat new to veganism, so I asked our server to recommend the best or most popular veggie burger.  He told us and then walked away to give us time to decide.  When he returned, my friend had a few more questions regarding the carnitas tacos dish.  At this point, the server seemed impatient and made the comment, \"Then you're not ready to order.\"  My friend replied, \"I'm ordering now,\" and the server responded, \"No, you're reading the menu and I have other people to serve.\"  My friend looked at me in total astonishment at the blatant rudeness and said, \"Let's go?\" And I said, \"Yeah!\"  So we got up to leave.  As we're walking away, the server then says something to the effect of:  Okay, fine.  In my opinion, he could've kept that.  When we got to the front door to walk out, I was so shocked, I turned around and held my hands out with my head to the side and said, \"Really?\"  The server threw his hands up and shrugged as if to say:  I don't care.  We were BLOWN  away!    I understand that sometimes customers can take a while in deciding which dish they'd like to order; I'd imagine that's quite common at any restaurant.  But I've never seen anyone treat customers so rude when we did nothing wrong and hadn't even been there long enough to be considered troublesome.  All the server had to do was choose to be tactful by explaining that, well, it looks like you have a few more questions and I'll be glad to help once I take care of another table.  That would've sufficed.  Actually, there were a million different ways he could've handled this situation, but simply chose to be short, curt and outright rude.  My friend and I were so perturbed at his behavior, the only sense we could make of it is that he simply didn't like us from the moment we walked in.  What other reason could there have been?  We are still deeply offended by the major disrespect we received from this owner/server at Bean Vegan Cuisine and have no intention of subjecting ourselves to this type of treatment at their establishment ever again.  How unfortunate!",

I love vegetables and don't eat meat at every meal but I'm not big on meat substitutes so I was a little skeptical.   I ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower, collard greens and fried squash. We also ordered the Crabbie dip as an appetizer. The crabbie dip surprised me. It was very good. A little chunky for me but after running a knife through my portion, I really enjoyed it. The buffalo cauliflower was very excellent and filling. I could not finish it. I loved the collard greens, I'm not sure how they did it but they had a bit of meat flavor like collards that had been cooked with pork. I didn't really like the fried squash. It was too mushy for me but that might because I didn't eat it right away. I probably should have gotten just one side because I was too full to eat the fried squash anyway. My vegan friend got the cowboy burger and really enjoyed it. Our other companion got the meatloaf, grilled zucchini and side salad and enjoyed everything. The meatloaf looked a lot more appetizing than other pictures I had seen on Yelp.",

I was starving & I wasn't sure this was going to fill the bill.  O my yum!    She had the Bacon Cheeseburger $?, which was a soy-based mix & Saitan which was thin-sliced as the bacon.  I took a bite - just a veggie burger to me.  (I can't eat soy, so I'm ok with that anyway)  She also got the side of zucchini which was delicious.  I had the Bella Bowl $12... A huge bowl of Jasmine Rice covered (but not smothered) in some kind of reddish bean (not kidney), they blanched Kale (!!), smoky portabella 'shrooms & some kind of drizzled dressing or creme.  (looking at the photos, the creme drizzle must be a signature flavor)  I loved it and it was so fillingI took more than half home to eat for dinner - just finished it!  The also have a selection of beers & wines.  My friend had a Red Ridge (I think that was the name) It was a Sorghum Beer.  Light body, with a hint of Sorghum (think molasses) in the color & finish - very clean. I had the Crispin Cider which was good.  Expensive to have a beer though... $6/bottle. (even PBR)  The inside is more like a slightly dingy diner with two-tops up against the long wall & a couple of group dining tables elsewhere.  The music was kind of 70's early 80's but they were singing right along to it.  Whatever makes you happy.  Getting into the restaurant is only on the uptown expressway side.  You have to turn right and get on Briar Creek & go across the overpass to turn left back onto the South-Bound Expressway, but other than that it's definitely a neighborhood gem as far as the food and service go.  I'll go back again!",

I generally would skip a veggie burger since it is such a staple when you go out and are stuck deciding between a VB or salad. After the waitress suggested getting it. I gave it a try and was extremely impressed. This is Charlotte's Rosetta's Kitchen.  This place is well worth stopping in. The only complaint is the location.

    "text": "I want this restaurant to thrive. They cater to vegans and offer some great selections (not to be confused with all healthy options, mind you!). I've been here twice now. My lunch included their version of a Big Mac, which was delicious. Again, not healthy, but my side of veggies with hardly any noticeable oil or \"butter\" was most definitely healthy. I splurged on their chocolate/caramel dessert. It was good but pricey.  My second visit on a Friday night with my husband, resulted in really good food again. His salad was loaded with fruits and veggies and came with an awesome dressing. My jackfruit tacos were a nice surprise and now I'm looking to try jackfruit at home too. We shared a ginger cookie, whipped cream dessert, which was a good ending to our meal.  The drawbacks are hard to overlook... the location is completely out of place and is only accessible going into town on the crazy Highway 74. The restaurant itself is so plain inside & out. So plain it's a bit of a turnoff to those who might not be drawn in by their specific food offerings.  I understand they recently got their liquor license, but I'll be surprised if that drastically increases traffic. They were noticeably uncrowded on a Friday night, pre-alcohol sales. The location & interior isn't a place I'd go out of my way to get a drink at. I'm simply there for the food.  Move this concept (and chefs!) to a more central, appealing, convenient location and I think they would be far more successful. I, for one, would be ready & willing to dine here more often to support this local business.",

I will not eat here until they change their policy regarding outside beverages. I'm not trying to bring in a freaking happy meal, it's a coffee mug. Get over it!

When the waiter (who btw was really nice and super attentive), my fiance had to damn near put a napkin under my chin to keep me from drooling. I had the cowboy burger which had a juicy patty topped off with some unbelievably good bacon and fried onion rings (no, we didn't come here for the salad) and the cheese was perfectly melted on the softest bun ever. They have a pretty good beer selection too which I don't think is mentioned on the menu (and great wine bottle specials too!). My hubby has the jalapeno burger which was [obviously] spicy, but nicely complemented by the vegan mayo. Suffice to say, we were deliriously happy by the end of it all, but could barely move. We are visiting from NYC, but this place beat any burger I've in NYC - by far...Bean Vegan, won't you please come to the big apple?!  It was only about a 5 minutes drive from uptown so super convenient to get to and they have large space so you're not sitting right next to another couple or group. I would highly recommend trying the dessert here too. We had the kit kat cake thingamajig and the chocolate was velvety and decadent while the wafers were perfectly crisp. I hesitate to compliment this place on it's delicious vegan food because it's delicious FOOD. Period. Vegan or not (my hubby is not), the food here (and staff!) is awesome.",

    "text": "As an omnivore who lives on mostly processed foods and takeout (which I am sure affects my tastebuds), I am kind of torn as to how to base my review.  I like meat and cheese.  A lot.  However, I think if I chose the vegan/vegetarian way of life, I believe this place would be a staple for me, as the dishes seem to be well thought out and prepared, I just wasn't a really big fan.     Off of Independence, we were trying to figure out what it used to be - we both thought maybe some sort of Mexican restaurant.  Early on a Saturday, there was plenty of parking and plenty of seating, though a constant ebb and flow of customers was nice.  It's either going to be a pain in the ass to get into or out of, depending on where you are coming from or going to, so be prepared for your GPS to give you a fit.  My food: Queso dip with tortilla chips:  As another reviewer stated, this is served with bag chips (and not very many at that).  The dip itself has a healthy portion of black beans and is flavored quite well, but my deadened tastebuds were missing sodium and maybe a little more spice.  It was quite tasty though and I would order it again if there.  Served with a fresh tasting salsa that I enjoyed.  I felt it would be improved with Velveeta (I am a pig, I know). The Reuben:  From some other reviews, I thought this was going to be a hit.  It was well prepared with grilled bread, just the right amount of kraut, 1000 island, and there may have been some sort of \"cheese\" in there.  The meat, while a meat texture, didn't really have the corned beef taste to me.  It was fine, but I (as a person who really likes corned beef) wouldn't order it again. Tater tot casserole:  There wasn't a description of this, so I am not exactly sure what makes it up.  I think I recognized potatoes, green peppers and onions.  There was some type of \"sausage\" (?) in it.  Under seasoned, I would not order that again.  My dining companion, who had their BBQ sandwich before said it was very good, ordered that again.  She kindly offered me a piece of the \"BBQ\" that fell off of her sammich and it was DELICIOUS.  I absolutely should have ordered it.  The sauce on it was smoky and tangy and the texture of whatever meat substitute is used with that was spot on (seriously).  I had wanted to try Bean, and if I had a buddy who wanted to go there, I would definitely go and order the BBQ sandwich (though I don't know what side?).   This is an excellent member of the Charlotte-dining scene.  As the George-generated Yelp saying goes - I ate here and I didn't die - 3 stars!",

My husband ordered the vegan reuben and wasn't as impressed with that meat substitute, he really liked my sandwich better.

The service was great and the meal didn't take too long which I had previously heard was sometimes slow since there is only one person cooking. My friend and I shared the special, the firecracker bowl, which featured spicy tofu, rice, beans, vegan cheese, kale and fried jalapenos. It was large and we had leftovers even with the two of us eating off of it. We also shared the jackfruit tacos. They tasted similarly to fish tacos. Also a very good choice. We decided on the mashed potatoes with gravy and tator tot casserole. Both excellent sides. I most likely could eat an entire meal of the tator tot casserole although it's not offered as a meal. Next time I may just order 3 small bowls of it because it's that good! The strawberry cheesecake was a nice way to end the meal. They had lots of dessert choices and many chocolate options as well. I was very full and really didn't need dessert but clearly that didn't stop me. We will be back. Thanks Bean.",

    "text": "Oh, Bean. Such a special place to both my husband and myself. We discovered Bean shortly after they opened, and thank goodness we did. We quickly realized that Bean was the missing ingredient in our life, and became regulars right away. The owners of the establishment and the staff were quick to welcome us into their extended family, and made us feel at home every time we walked through the door (which sometimes was 3-4 times per week).   This is the place to go when you're craving a good, home cooking style, comforting meal. I see that other people mentioned a lack of more diverse 'healthy options', but to me, that's silly. You are eating vegan alternatives to animal products, so first of all, that makes them 'healthier' options, and secondly, there are plenty of places where you can go get a cold pressed juice and a quinoa salad. Bean has an amazing selection of delicious diner style items, and there are plenty of healthier options as well (salads, bowls, sides of veggies). In my opinion, life is too short to not enjoy the food that you are consuming.   My absolute favorite things are the Firecracker Bowl, the King Burger, and the Buffalo Tofu Fingers. The specials are always amazing as well. Bean quickly became a regular part of routine that we did not want to go without.  If they didn't exist, I'm not sure how well we would have done maintaining our veganism when eating out (we probably would just not eat out). Charlotte does not have many places that offer vegan food, and it was such a blessing to stumble upon a place we actually craved and wanted to frequent.  We recently had to move away, and not a day goes by where we do not dream about walking through those doors and sitting down for, what is still, the best damn vegan food we've ever found. Our new city has nothing that even remotely compares, and I greatly look forward to stuffing my face full of delicious Bean fare at my next opportunity.",

I can recommend the pulled (soy curl) bbq sandwich, the Reuben (homemade seitan), fishless fish sandwich, slaw (it is vinegar-based), cabbage, layer cakes (outstanding actually), kitty cat cake, cowboy cookies, and peanut butter pretzel cups (think Take 5 bar). The meatloaf and tater tot casserole are good items as well. The mega bean salad was okay. I can't stand the fried (oily) zucchini, but I don't like fried foods anyway and I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered it. They also have a lot of grab and go items in their market which are good.   Solid vegan food, friendly and efficient service, local organic products, and their mission statement is based on the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Love it!  Even though I think it really is 4 1/2 stars I'm going to upgrade my review to give it five. I think I can be classified as being a Beanstalker now. :)",

The table behind us was set minutes after us. The waitress came our way and ignored us but waited on other table. She got drinks and order for that table before even acknowledging us. Finally we were waited on. When she came over I told her we would give her our order as well as drink order. She had to leave the table to retrieve her notebook before taking our order. That finally accomplished , she brought drinks and we waited for food. While waiting my husband wanted another beer. Since our waitress never came back to the table we had to flag down a passing worker to get a beer. When the food arrived it was similar to usual. The bean and rice were under seasoned and runny. Never had that happen before. They have changed their fries as well, not as good. Over all the food was good but this time the service was very bad. I am a 20% tipper but not this time. I think the Asheville location must be doing well and getting all the attention from owners. I think we will try The Fern next time we want a good vegetable burger.",

The workers lack any experience on how to properly service their customers. They lack knowledge of the menu, and failed to properly put all of our orders in. The manager there was also rude and offered zero assistance in helping to rectify our order. A large percentage of vegans choose such a diet as a part of a healthy lifestyle. Regardless of the sign on the table that describes a vegan diet as a way to promote good health, the majority of the items are fried and completely lacking nutrition. I've been to steak houses that offered better tasting, healthier vegan options. I would NOT recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious, healthy vegan meal.",

Bean gives you HUGE varying portions (depending on what you get) that you will be able to even take home and snack on later. If you're ending your meal not-so-satisfied, which i doubt you are, order a milkshake (ask about the specialty shake of the month) and you will NO DOUBT leave happier",

I want to say that if I were rating the staff only then I would give a 5 star review. They were all very pleasant and in my case not slow like some of the other reviews stated. The cleanliness of the restaurant wasn't great, the floor was definitely sticky and the walls could use a wash down but I wouldn't feel the need to give a poor review based on that alone.   My problem was definitely with the food. I ordered the jalapeno burger with a side of fried pickles and fresh fruit. I first tried the pickles. They were over salted big time and I suppose over breaded because it was more like I was eating a fried crisp and not so much a pickle. I usually will pick at something even if I don't like it but I couldn't make myself eat these. The portion size was very generous but I had to toss them out. I felt okay about that considering I still had my fruit and burger.  Once I bit into my burger it was a similar situation. Tasted like salt :(. The jalapenos were again over fried so I wasn't even getting a spicy taste- seriously just salt. I was still hungry so I really didn't want to toss this out but I could not eat it. And I can REALLY eat almost anything.  I wish that the portion size of the fruit had been as generous as the fried pickles because that was the only part I actually ate. It was delicious and fresh but an extremely small portion size. I am still hungry and seems I wasted 20$ on salt. But like I said the staff was nice. Maybe the kitchen was just having a terrible night?",

    "text": "After my girlfriend ruined my life by forcing me to watch a documentary that has turned me off of eating meat for the time being, I've been forced to explore the Charlotte restaurant scene for better vegetarian meal options.  Bean Vegan Cuisine sounded like a great place to try, since its name has \"Vegan\" in it...duh.  I was very impressed with all the options and I've never tried some of the meat alternatives they offer.  Seitan bacon??  I had no damn clue what that was, but if it tasted like bacon, I knew I had to load up!  I ordered the Jalapeno Cheddar Burger (with seitan bacon, of course) and my girlfriend ordered the Cowboy Burger.  My girlfriend and I did the typical splitsies with our meals, so I got to try both burgers.  While this wasn't my favorite non-meat burger, it was very good and I'd highly recommend giving this place a try.  The seiton bacon definitely had that familiar taste, but let's be real, bacon is bacon.    You may be asking yourself why I would only give a place 3 stars, when the options were great and the food was good - well, that's because the service stunk.  It took a while to be seated, food service was slow, our waters were never refilled, and it took FOREVER to get the check.  We were hoping to check out the little store they have in the back that sells vegan products, but we had a movie to catch and didn't end up having time after waiting so long.        At the end of the day,  I'm definitely going to give this place another shot.  If the service is improved, I'll absolutely update my rating.  I consider myself a fair guy.    On a side note - Writing this review is making me reminisce about the good ol' days when I ate meat.  I think I might have to pick a fight with my girlfriend on purpose tonight.",

We arrived at 5:30 PM on a Friday evening and the restaurant was surprisingly full. The crowd was incredibly varied--not just the crunchy granola types I was subconsciously expecting. The outside of Bean is rather hideous...beige with no windows like an industrial complex. The inside was not memorable except for a colorful chalkboard advertising the specials. Bean also offers a vegan store which has several amazing vegan products that are otherwise difficult to find in the South...even at Trader Joe's or Harris Teeter.  After discussing our options with our waitress', she recommended the \"Fishless Fish Sandwich\" and the jalapeno burger. I was super disappointed by the burger...I had expressed to my waitress my raging dislike of all the vegan cheeses I had tried, but she insisted that THIS vegan cheese (Daiya cheddar) was great, and that you could barely taste it on the burger. That was not the case! The dirty-feet cheese taste overpowered the burger, which was mealy and bland.  On the positive side, my meat-eating boyfriend loved the Fishless Fish Sandwich! It was made with Gardein products, and these are now a staple of his transitioning diet. I am grateful to Bean for giving me the opportunity to introduce him to vegan cuisine.  For our sides we had French fries (good) and breaded squash (greasy but good).  I will be trying Bean again, because there are not as many vegan options in Charlotte as I would like. I will keep you updated as to how it goes in the future!",

As soon as I open the door, it looks like a dive. It's so dark in there and then old building funk hits me in the face. I don't mean like an antique store, I mean like an old damp basement. Ughhh. I run to rest room. Nasty and sticky floors. Hibbee jibbees thinking about it.  I come out and I'm told I can't sit 25 ft from door,  as a short thick black female points and reads sign \"You are supposed to wait before being seated\". Ho you have 4 customers total, me included. You should be more accomodating when you barely have business.  I'm not trying to be funny but I don't know too many black folks that are vegan down south, and I'm staring at 3 other black dudes, in there 20's (at separate tables, no food in site) in the restaurant that do not look vegan, and as someone else had mentioned, there was this odd atmosphere as if I had interrupted something and I was an outsider. It just has the feeling it's a front for other activity.  Between the old damp funk, sticky nasty restroom floors, rude greeter, and strange ambiance, I decided to take my business elsewhere and drove to south end and tried Luna's Living Kitchen. Great atmosphere and decent food. I can't believe others aren't  mentioning how unsanitary Bean Cuisine is. Just yuck. The double doors to the kitchen is nasty too. See for yourself.",

Our waitress was very kind and attentive. Sidebar: I'm still regretting not ordering dessert and considering stopping by on my way out tomorrow. Don't make the same mistake!  We ordered the buffalo tofu tenders as an appetizer with a side of ranch - delicious. My lunch date got a burger topped with chili and a side of tater tot casserole, and I ordered the Reuben with mac & cheese. The Reuben was phenomenal, and I had half leftover to bring home. If you're vegan, this is a must-visit, and don't forget dessert! :)",

I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings. I've had these several times before at other places. These were my least favorite, they were just okay. My friend and I both ordered the jackfruit tacos which smelled really good but very bland flavor. We doused the tacos in salt and sauces hoping it would help taste good but we couldn't bring ourselves to finish one out of the 3 tacos. Very disappointing. Tacos came with 2 sides. I got the fried pickles and collard greens by the suggestion of our waitress. Fried pickles were just okay. The collard greens were overly dressed and cold. Overall I was not impressed or even satisfied with the food here. I'm not that picky of an eater, I can make do with most, but I can't eat tasteless limp food. Perhaps these cooks are different than the ones that prepared the dishes for thegood reviews.",

The chick with the braids was rude and was a  horrible hostest.  it has to be a better way to service your customers especially loyal ones.I've never experienced such sucky service before in my life and it's bad because we don't have many vegan restaurants in Charlotte.

Every contact I've had with the owner has been unpleasant, and, in hindsight, I wish I had just walked out the first time. He seems like the type of person who would spit in your food if you look at him the wrong way. The restaurant does have a bad smell to it and the food seems to absorb it. The food here is hit or miss. I've had some great menu items and some really bad ones. I think my first review was based on the thrill of having an all-vegan restaurant in my area. I won't be back.   To anyone who did not receive something that you paid for and you paid with credit, I encourage you to dispute the charge with your credit card company. I also suggest contacting the Better Business Bureau with all complaints. It's happened to multiple customers, so it's definitely not an accident. He won't stop treating customers this way without consequences for his actions.",

I live in NYC now but am from South Carolina so I am aware that the lack of variety in these southern cities is based on the majority southern cuisine bandwagon...it is what it is. However when I do come across some unicorn vegan establishment I get super excited!  Now let's discuss Bean Vegan Cuisine.  I ordered the teriyaki fried cauliflower and the Philly cheesesteak with no peppers, onions, or tomatoes, yes I know for most those are some of the best parts of the cheesesteak but what can I say I'm not much for those items. Anyway, the cauliflower was very salty and somewhat soggy from the fry grease I assume. As for the cheesesteak...I honestly can't say how it tasted because they messed up more order twice. As much as I would have loved to sit around and let them try to fix it for a third time, I had a flight to catch. This was my first and last time to this establishment. I plan on sticking with my go to, Fern, when I'm in town...",

They said something like \"let's see if she can do it\" in a very snarky way. This was very clear and could be heard by many other customers in there. There is no way that one person could've handled all of those tables, and the girl was very friendly, even though she was obviously stressed.

My husband, an omnivore, loves the BBQ and Tofu Fingers, but his biggest obsession is the chocolate cake.  He said it is the best he's ever had, and he is a picky fellow.  Para mi, my love is the Jack Fruit Carnitas.  The texture and flavor balance are perfect, in my opinion.  Plus you get two delicious sides with it!

That's ridiculous especially considering me and my friend had our food and were half way through it. His just sat there for a good bit while we ate and didn't get to him till I went up to her and asked for it. What kind of crap is that?

I highly recommend the bean bowl with fried buffalo tofu fingers, or even the tofu fingers in any form. The vegan ranch blew me away and the flavor in all the food was awesome.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and I feel if you are going to go specialize in Vegan cooking, your Vegan items should be better than restaurants that don't serve vegan food.   The staff was very friendly and helpful, but everything else was lacking.   We got a veggie burger, and it was small and average tasting. I've had better veggie burgers at Ruby Tuesday, and I hate that place. The side dishes were just things you could make at home. They tasted fine.   We also had our order come out wrong. We were the only one's in the restaurant and ordered 1 thing, and we waited a while for it, so this was disappointing. They fixed it fast and were very nice.   But, maybe we caught them on a bad day, everyone has bad days.",

All of their sandwiches are so flavorful and filling. Today I tried the BBQ sandwich with Cole slaw and it tasted better than pulled pork BBQ. Def check this place out- even if you love your meats. You will not be disappointed. Their market carries La Croix too!",

    "text": "Wow. Can't believe that it took this long to check out Bean! Some may be a little deterred by the idea of veganism, but chef really puts an end to that debacle. The flavors here are incredible, innovative, thoughtful, and really fun.   We came in on a Saturday afternoon and pretty much every table in the main dining area was full. We sat immediately, however, and worked our way up and down the menu. The service was friendly and very helpful with some of the items I was unfamiliar with. We placed our order and had a chance to just hang out whilst waiting. It did take a while to get our food, but chef was the only person in the kitchen and seriously putting in some hustle. Fun to watch!   Our food came. DELICIOUS. I ordered the Buffalo Bean Bowl -- rice, kidney beans, kale, vegan ranch, and tofu coated in buffalo sauce. It was magic. So flavorful and all of the spices swirled around magnificently. We also ordered a side of the northern white beans, more kale, and braised cabbage. All were perfect. It's so nice when fresh veggies are flavorful in their own right and not slathered with butter or some bogus sauce. Chef really puts time into making each item flavorful. My wife ordered the seitan burger sans bun. It was wonderfully smoky and hearty.   Each of our plates came with a banana nut muffin. Holy cow! Those things are amazing! No dairy whatsoever.   We were stuffed. So much food and both of us dined for less than $30.   Where I love the food and the staff, I think the ambiance is a little droll. Think their still working on the space and trying to liven it up a bit. Some simple decor would be great. Also, the men's room is a little dingy. Not a huge deal, but think it just lends itself to being a dated building off of Independence.   Though a bit difficult to get into (hyperspeed traffic on Independence Blvd), it's totally worth it. I can't wait to go back.",

Now, I have been there at least a dozen times and have tried most of the menu. They are improving. Short review: they now get 5 stars!  They now have a full menu and the food is about as good as vegan food can get. No, it still won't fool a meat eater. But that's not a bad thing. Their foods taste so good and conjure up your favorite dishes, but without the negative effects (remember getting real meat stuck in your teeth? Yuck). They have taken all the good qualities of traditional American dishes and applied them to vegan dishes.  Try them for yourself with an open mind. My personal favorites are the bacon cheeseburger, Reuben and fried pickles.   Writing this review has made me craving Bean. They aren't open now. Arrrgh.",

I've been vegan for six years and for a while had limited options when I returned to my home town of Charlotte, but now I have Bean! My entire family (carnivores included) loves Bean. I had the tofu finger sandwich buffalo style, which was delicious, and we all split the fried pickles with vegan ranch on the side. We also split the blueberry cheesecake for dessert-- it was divine, and had no weird silken tofu aftertaste. Kind, helpful waitstaff, too. Will definitely return!",

I also took a non-vegetarian person with me and they enjoyed a hearty BBQ Jack-fruit burger with Buffalo Fingers while I had a Jalapeno Cheddar Burger. I was amazed at how tasty the meal items were and the texture was spot on. The second time around I was able to talk to one of the co-owners (Roy) about the restaurant. During our discussion, he informed me that all of their meat substitutes are made in house which is totally awesome! I could tell that Roy really wanted to reach out to the community and offer a compassionate lifestyle that doesn't have to be boring or bland. I rate this 5 out of 5 stars for their DIY approach to making their own food and their effort in creating a 100% vegan kitchen.  Nick",

However now when you order a salad, the corn bread is left off and you feel awkward asking for it, or you order the cheesecake and there's no chocolate drizzle or whip topping... or there's no silverware for a take out order...

We LOVE the food and that is the only reason we come back, but the customer service is not so good, we have had to ask for the same things repeatedly and still don't get it. Sometimes when we get it to go we don't get napkins or silverware. It's disappointing because the food is good and we are paying a fair amount for it. Other than the customer service being mediocre the decor is sad. It can honestly make one depressed. We love bean, (the food) but the customer service is slacking, seriously last time we went (we are regulars) we waited over 30 minutes for our food. Don't get us wrong, the only reason for my three stars is because 1. Customer service is not the best and 2. The place is dad, other than that the food is honestly amazing and if they can apply the changes that many people have already suggested I think bean will make a great improvement and bring a lot more customers.",

    "text": "Long overdue review of Bean. I went here with my toddler a few months ago--wasn't sure how we would be received, but turns out this place is very kid-friendly and has excellent service. Great children's menu, and I ended up going with a plate of veggie sides for her. Despite the positive jackfruit reviews, I decided to try the Jalapeno Cheeseburger: ding ding ding!! We have a winner folks. This burger is dee-licious. So much so, that my toddler took it from me (sans jalapenos) and munched on it exclusively instead of her sides. I also ended up purchasing another cheeseburger to go to bring to my husband. I've come back to Bean a few times since then, but always get the Jalapeno Cheeseburger because it really is that good. My only nits for this place is that their kale side needs something more (like sesame oil) to give it a kick, and I wasn't a fan of the nutritional yeast flake Mac and Cheese, although my former-vegan husband claims it is delicious (acquired NYF taste, I guess). But, for the main meal, the jalapeno cheeseburger is not to be missed.",

I saw the Bean randomly while on Independence and laughed b/c I got a kick out of the name. Weeks later I thought I'd give it a try.....So glad I did. The menu is tasty- and very different. I had seen mixed reviews on the beer and wine (or if they served it) and indeed they do serve both. I hope to see more selection of (in particular) beers, but the Shock Top hit the spot. I decided to try the Jack Fruit Tacos- DELISH! The blending of flavors was excellent. A few of my friends tried some other options- like the \"bacon\" Cheeseburger and the \"wings\"- both delish. It's definitely in an odd spot and a 'destination' spot, but don't be fooled by the location....it's a great restaurant to try! Our server was polite and attentive. A tad $$$ for the servings- I can't say it will be a regular spot for me, but will make it a special occasion spot. Try it out!",

The Buffalo fingers sandwich was really greasy and did not have good spicy Buffalo flavor like it could have had.  Bean is serving so-so diner food.

I hope the owners will revisit their menu and make some changes before the place goes down the drain.  We definitely made our first and last visit.",
