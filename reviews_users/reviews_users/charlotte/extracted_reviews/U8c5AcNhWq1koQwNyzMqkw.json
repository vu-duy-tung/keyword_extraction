This place is a great combination if the model of team work & good customer service with good food for the most part. My Family & I have a weekly ritual to go to brunch every Saturday as part of our Family Day Fun.  Today (Saturday - it's after midnight so yesterday) was our second visit. We returned for the good service & good food according to my family & myself for the most part. The only thing I had a problem with was my Banana Nut French. toast. I make it at home & I don't make it & put peanut butter with cooked bananas mixed with nuts (soggy may I add) in between bread & call it stuff French toast. I personally prefer my Banana nut French toast to be presented & prepared with the uncooked bananas & nuts on top of the cooked French Toast. If you prefer it made the way I described that it was made then \"Go For It\"..  Our dishes are as follows (weekly routine after my mishap) & we are always pleasantly pleased.. Egg White Avocado, Tomato & Parmesan cheese omelette (it is on the menu with bacon but I get it minus the bacon & add Mushrooms) with a side of Fruit &Rye Toast. Egg white veggie omelette with a side of Turkey Bacon, Cheese grits & Rye Toast.. Breakfast sandwich with eggs scrambled hard with cheddar cheese, turkey bacon on White..  The Bellini is AMAZING may I add.. Great place for brunch which is the only thing we've had as a family or individually. Very nice to Enjoy the patio while its still weather friendly..   Bon Appetite",

    "text": "Dined here for the second time. There are positives and negatives to this place. The positives are from meals that weren't mine. I've tasted their quiche and French toast, both of which are awesome. My two meals were underwhelming. I was excited to see corned beef hash and that's something I'll always order when available. The disappointment was that I struggled to locate much meat in my potatoes. It was probably a 10% corned beef to 90% potato ratio. Today I ordered the Left Coast BLT. Everything on the sandwich was great but for such a large sandwich, I had only three pieces of bacon... On a BLT! I had to combine the ingredients from both halves of the sandwich to make one decent sized \"half sandwich\". It appears the folks at this place are extremely stingy on the meats. I doubt I'll return.",

My wife and I both had the Cobb Salad for lunch - it was excellent.   This location has seen a couple of restaurants come and go - with good reason. They all had issues. Toast is showing that the location was not the issue - the issue was the product - as it usually is.  Very nice. I didn't give it 5 stars because at one point it was too noisy to actually talk across the table. That might just be a bi-product of their success (they were packed) but it is still an issue.",

We both had omelets; my husband had the Western and I had The Usual-filled with apple sausage and huge chunks of grilled onions that tasted like they had been pre-sauteed prior together and a bit of cheddar (I think). I'm not a huge fan of a lot of cheese with my eggs so that was a good thing.  After ordering it felt like only 5 minutes had passed before our plates were ready.     While the food was very good, I'm giving 5 stars for the service which was outstanding from the minute we walked in until we left. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there.  They were very attentive but not in that annoying stalking sort of way. And for that reason, I will be back. Two thumbs up!",

I had the French Toast combo with the peanut butter and banana stuffed French toast which was average.. Nothing out of this world, but okay.  Their coffee is amazing,  which I liked. Now on to the negative,  the service was awful!! My server approached our table with a terrible attitude.  I asked him what he recommended from their menu and he provided no positive input. We basically ordered whatever we thought sounded good. Then,  my girlfriend and I politely asked for our basket of corn bread in which he quickly forgot and never came back to our table until our breakfast was served. We had to remind him and that's when he came back with it.  After that he never came back around to see if we were okay.  I flagged him down for our check and a refill on my coffee; and ONCE AGAIN he forgot. I had to ask a second employee for a refill since my own server never came back to my table.    My girlfriend and I left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouth from the bad service we received. Let's just say,  it's definitely NOT worth it unless you're looking for good coffee... And good luck trying to get a refill!",

Second weekend in a row for us they ran out of my wifes order. 15 mins AFTER we ordered, waitress told us they were out of the Spinach Quiche on the brunch menu. How did she not know it was running low when we orderd? She then said \" we should be there by 10 am or it'll run out\".   I thought it was a BRUNCH, not breakfast menu. So then she ordered egg breakfast with biscuit. They delivered the eggs, then said they were out of biscuits. The waitress later came by to see how things were, and when we told her they were also out of her biscuit, she gave a little laugh, and just left?!?  Never did a manager come by so I guess she didnt bother telling anyone. I worked in restaurants for years during college and its all about communication from the kitchen, and attention to the details, from open to close. Either they didnt tell her what was running low, or she didnt hear them. Let us know before we order!. My potatoes were cold, the toast was bone cold, no butter on it or delivered...just the little things add up to a disappointing experience, again. We'll try again , hopefully, they pay attention to the details until 3 pm next time.",

    "text": "Finally got around to trying this place after eagerly awaiting the replacement for the awful Cafe Really.  I had high hopes after hearing good reviews from neighbours.  Toast fell below my expectations.  I ordered the corned beef hash after the waiter recommended it.  I don't want to say it was out of a can, but it tasted like it.  Corned beef hash is hit and miss usually, so my I didn't have high hopes.  I ordered my eggs over-medium (they advertize that they only use pasteurized eggs) but they came out over-easy.  The hollandaise sauce was not great either.  It looked like my plate had been sitting a few minutes before it came out.    The wheat toast I ordered was pretty good.  Coffee was good.  Others in my party ordered an omelet.  They thought it was good.  I tasted it and thought it was so-so.  The crepes were too sweet for the person that ordered them, but I didn't try them myself.  We also ordered a la carte bacon and pancakes.  Both were good.  This brings me to one disappointing aspect of the restaurant.  Everything is a la carte.  So my breakfast cost me $9 for the hash, $2 for coffee, and $1 for toast.  I felt this was too much for what I got and the way it was prepared.  As another poster mentioned, the portion was pretty small.   Service was really good.  Every staffer was friendly and helpful.  Water and coffee refilled often.  Staff are why I will try the place again.  I will also order something else and give it another shot, maybe at lunch too.  I really want this place to succeed.  The little plaza needs them there.  I hope the owners increase food quality and portion, and watch what they charge.",

For breakfast they have a nice choice of omelets and not just the usual western, cheese, broccoli and cheese, etc. that most restaurants offer.  The omelets are perfectly cooked and folded and the ingredients taste fresh.  They also serve good eggs Benedict and have a nice choice of specials.  Our kids really like the pancakes, although they don't have a kids menu (but do decrease portion size).

It was huge, cooked perfectly and included just the right amount of lobster, Parmesan cheese and bell peppers. The breakfast potatoes on the side were a great addition. For those that enjoy mimosas, they have a nice selection of options including a traditional mimosa, a champagne punch and a peach Bellini.

    "text": "Finally got around to trying out Toast this morning.  It was pretty busy and we had about a 15-20 minute wait for a table.  They have completely re-done the interior decor - enclosing the formerly open kitchen, and repainting the interior to warm and homey colors.  When it was our turn for a table, we had the choice to eat inside our outside. Since the weather is nice, we decided to sit outside.    Unfortunately, we had a dirty table that was not prepared for us and had no flatware.  Our server came by pretty quickly to take our drink orders and brought a basket of cornbread, but still no flatware.  The cornbread was slightly sweet and tasted ok. But it would have been nice if they brought it out warm with butter in the basket. It would have also been nice to bring small plates for our cornbread.   The menu had a decent amount of options for omelettes, scrambles, pancakes and etc.  The sides included grits, hashbrowns, or fruit.  They do offer turkey bacon as an option so I was pleased about that.   I decided to try one of  the many specials... so I got the turkey scramble.  It included turkey, spinach, egg whites and gruyere cheese.  I went with the grits as my side along with whole wheat toast. The egg scramble could have easily been a bit bland...but it had nice texture and flavor.  The grits were not the best but were ok.  While we were waiting for our food to come out, twice someone from the kitchen tried to serve us someone else's food.  This is not a great sign.   Also, they must have messed up the order of a table close by, because I heard their server tell them that they were taking $16 off their bill.   I might rate the food 4 stars, but service overall was off and I would rate that 3 stars.   But if they correct some of the service issues, I think they can make this place a success.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Toast, the simplicity of the menu an decorations was very welcoming! The huge dancing man in the Toast costume, didn't hurt either!   People must really love this place we stopped in early Sunday afternoon and had about a 15 minute wait. When we were finally seated, just based on the amount of people I was excited to try out this place.  Toast offers your normal brunch variety, eggs, omelets, salads, sandwiches and burgers.   I decided to keep it simple and try the biscuits and gravy with a side if hash browns. The food came out quickly, and it was HOT! The biscuits were flaky and delicious. The gravy was like none I've had before, it was  delicious, creamy with a hint of spice after each bite. The hash browns were my favorite! They were potatoes seasoned to perfection then cut into pieces before baked and served...add a little ketchup and they were delicious!   The only downside and the reason I didn't give more stars was based on service. Our waitress made me feel very rushed and unwelcome. Literally, we sat down, she took our drink order than asked if we were ready to order. No time to review the menu or ask questions about the specials or favorite dishes! We told her we needed more time and then after a long wait she finally came back for our orders.   Once she took our orders, we really didn't get to see her again. I mean really...It was our first visit, so I will have liked to hear about some of the dishes;  maybe even some of her favorites or suggestions. Or just an overall \"how did everything turn out?!?\" would have been nice.   However, the manager Brian did come over and thank us for coming in and asked how the food was...so a small redemption!   So sure, I will go back, give them another try.",

May be good for the business but quality of food and customer satisfaction may decline. It happens. However, I did appreciate the freshly brewed cup of Lavazza coffee.

    "text": "My first time at Famous Toastery was today and I decided to meet my best friend there for brunch. I walk up to the door and someone already has it open \"hello welcome to Famous Toastery\" we had a small dog with us that fits in my friends purse so we decided to sit outside. Nick the manager immediately came out and greeted us and asked us have we ever been there before and what we would like to drink. From the moment we walked in to the moment that we left it was nonstop star service! One of the servers that waited on us Spencer was on top of his game. Being that we have never been there before he went over the menu with us and told us the big sellers. My friend and I both decided on the Avocado Benny. We both decided on poached eggs and Spencer told us try it with the medium cooked yolk, you'll love it. He was right on the money this avocado dish is great for someone who is watching their carbs. Basically they cut the bottom of the avocado so it can lay flat on the plate and when they take the seed out they pour the poached egg in the hole cover it with cheese, onions, tomatoes and I think green onions. First bite... sweet sassy molassy this is good! We decided to get fresh fruit with both of our dishes. My friend got a cup of coffee but I decided to be bad and went with a Rumosa. It has in it (I think) champagne, rum, juice... I don't know all I know is that I wanted more than just one! We had a great experience, I will definitely be coming back to Famous Toastery!!!",

Warm eggs yolks with the hollandaise sauce-nothing better.  You don't have just one server, but a team, anyone on their or in the area, made sure things were good.

My husband and I went for breakfast, I ordered a sunrise burrito with side of breakfast potatoes and he got an omelet with sausage gravy. The order came out as sausages instead of sausage gravy and a regular burrito. They retried and brought my the correct burrito, it took about 10 minutes with no apology to remake it, then when it came it had the texture of being marinated in water for those 10 minutes it was so soggy. To boot the waitress took our bill after messing up the first order and increasing it by $2 for the burrito I ordered. When they took away my meal I was expecting them to ask if I didn't enjoy it since there was a full meal left on my plate but nope they just took it and asked if they could get me anything else. No thank you just maybe a paper reminder for me never to return.",

Ordered a dish that was supposed to be served with poached eggs... unfortunately those eggs were totally hard-cooked.  Huh?  The dish, itself, was also served cold, as was the french toast dish... the soft butter that was added at the table didn't even begin to melt, even slightly... Really?  The toast that was ordered, came out warm, but not even toasty.  Where did we lose the concept of toast?  The remake of the dish with the poached eggs, came out sarcastically undercooked, and it managed to come out cold, as well.  The manager apologized and when he asked if they could remake things (again) or get anything else, we declined.  He said he didn't want us to go hungry, and so we explained we would go elsewhere to eat.  Problem solved.  The manager also explained that their kitchen prides itself on serving dishes so quickly that they don't even have any heat lamps in the kitchen... well, might be a good idea to get some, since they cannot seem to carry any of it out and ensure it's hot.  Needless to say, we W---- B- B---....",

    "text": "So, I have only previously been to the Toast location in Dilworth.  So, after Mass this past Sunday my Mom actually decided that we could give a new place a shot, crazy since we always end up at the same place. I was excited.  On our way there I called ahead and was able to put our name in, which is a definite bonus.  I was given a 25 minute wait time so we only had to wait about 10 minutes once we arrived and I let them know we were there. Once we were seated the confusion began.  We seemed to have three people waiting on us, asking the same questions. Finally I had to tell one of them we have already given our drink orders.  We were also seated by a door on the side of the restaurant, which servers and the Manager were running in and out of so the cold kept coming in. Not pleasant at all. The party next to us actually requested to be moved, but we held out since there would have been a long wait for another table. My Mom order the crepe special which she loved.  However, she could not touch her Bloody Mary as it was a cup of horseradish. I had it send back and she ordered a mimosa which she was much happier with. I chose the MBS, mushroom, bacon, and swiss omelette and added peppers and onions. The mushrooms seemed like they were overcooked, very soggy! Or, maybe out of a can? And, the peppers and onions were not cooked at all.  Overall it was just okay. But, as I think I feel about the other location, rushed service, confusion, and okay food, it applies here as well.",

My friend got the Greek omelet and she said she wouldn't order it again, it was just OK. Would love to come back here because I couldn't decide between several things on the menu.",

The food is delicious and always comes out super fast. The servers are speedy, friendly and very polite. I am a sucker for breakfast and can't seem to get past the breakfast menu but all of the dishes I've seen look great.   The restaurant is located in a shopping center off of Rea Rd. and is pretty easy to locate. Parking is also a breeze as it's there is plenty to go around. Important point: All Toast Cafe restaurants take payment at the cash register up front. I always forget this and freak out when the server only brings one check to the table.   I love the Toast location in Dilworth and now I love the Ballantyne location too. :)",

    "text": "For a while, I thought the problem with this place was the absurd \"everyone's your waiter so no one's your waiter\" policy, but really the main problem is the food. It's the sort of food you'd get at a wedding that claims to be open bar, but only serves white wine. It's as bland as the patrons, which I suppose makes sense. The restaurant must cater to WASPy palates; I wish there were some sign that would advertise the fact. Maybe a Jesus fish and Trump sign would be enough. Regardless, if you like flavor, seasoned food, diversity or anything remotely interesting, there are better places to spend your time and money.  To be specific, I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. It came out suspiciously quickly. I hate adding salt to food, but this needed it. Ironically, the place is called The Toastery, but the promised bread did not come out. The corn bread did come out first but was marginally edible. Even the apple butter was not very good and who doesn't love apple butter?  I guess the food is less boring than where most of the diners were going. I won't say where, but it was 8:30 am on Sunday and there were a whole bunch of pasty white men in polo shirts.",

Another gripe: include the kids drink in the kids meal price.. my daughter's pancakes were 4.99 and her lemonade was 2.99. That's flat out ridiculous. Make it 5.99 and you are still making money.  Food is good, wonderfully presented. Whomever said their omelettes are \"huge\"... take a trip to Camellia Grille in New Orleans and then tell me if the omelettes at Toast are \"huge\". Toast's omelettes are reasonably sized and tasty. The side potatoes were very good. My only complaint was there wasn't enough.. and I don't mean they were skimpy (portion was fair), it's just that I wanted more!  EDIT: The restaurant was apparently bought out by the chain \"Famous Toastery\". With that buyout came an adjusted menu. One thing we noticed yesterday is the \"Combo\" - one pancake, one egg, bacon for 10.99 can be purchased a la carte for $2 less. The waiter said \"oh yeah, you caught that\". So, basically the Famous Toastery hopes you're an idiot and opt to pay $2 more for a \"combo\" than if you bought one pancake, one egg and an order of bacon a la carte.  Four stars just went down to two.",

This past Saturday we tried Toast as it was the next in our \"Breakfast Places\" list.    We got there and it was bit crowded, about a 10-15 minute wait for our party of two.  If you are anything other than a party of two, I would suggest you get there early.    We were seated and handed menus and our drink order was taken.  They must use a \"team service\" style model as the person who brought us our coffee was not the same person who took our food order, nor was that the same person who came to check on us later, but they were all friendly, and I didn't feel rushed.    We both ordered coffees and we were graciously given a basket of corn bread with apple butter.  The cornbread was good, the apple butter was good.  The apple butter ON the cornbread, not so good, but there was butter on the table so I didn't even have to ask for it.    I got an Avocado Omlette with home fries and rye toast.  The Boy got Spinach Quiche with fresh fruit and grits.    The omlette was good but it was huge.  It must ahve been a three egg omlette, I could only eat half.  The homefries were good, just what I was expecting.  The toast was toast.  It's hard to mess it up.    The Boy's quiche was the best quiche I had ever tasted.  It had spinach, feta, and olives.  It was AMAZING.  The grits were really good.  They had a coarser texture than some of the other grits we've had and really had a corn flavor.    All in all, we'll definitely be back.",

Weekdays are best to go when tables are easy to get. Weekends can be crazy with a horde of people waiting outside and the place is jam packed.

My son loves their french toast, and I've heard from more than one person that this is their favorite french toast in town. The bloody marys are spicy with plenty of fresh horseradish. I am not big on breakfast (can't eat eggs) so I usually order from the lunch menu. I love their sandwiches and salads.

We aren't the most adventurous crowd, we tend to stick to the breakfast basics, but they're still darn tasty.  Service was a little chaotic and therefore slow.  People running around everywhere (literally).  I can't tell if it's the table layout, the training, or some combination of both.  If they can fix their service issues, I'd give them a 5 star review.",

She ordered the chicken salad with strawberries, pears, almonds, brie, and other goodies and I ordered the crab salad rolls. The food was so delicious we hardly spoke.

    "text": "Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Quote time to get sat was 25 mins. We saw a few chairs available at the bar area and decided to sit there instead. Bar area is small. I think it sits approx 5 people. Service was great.   We each got an omelette. Omelettes were huge. I got a side of salsa with it and it was delicious. I got the western omelette and it had ham, onions and green peppers and cheese. Everything was good but the onions and peppers were huge. I also had a lot of peppers in my omelette. I got cinnamon raisin toast and put a slather of butter on it and it was good.   They do serve you cornbread at the beginning of the meal. I'm not a fan of cornbread so I didn't try it but my friend and fiance did and said it was good but they wished it was served warm. They said it was cold.   My fiance got a Bloody Mary and loved it. My friend got the mimosa and said they put in just the right amount of orange juice in it.   Overall, we would all definitely go back again. My only complaint is that I had my purse hanging on my chair and someone that walked by (possibly a food runner or server) spilled coffee on my purse without telling me! When I got to my car I saw a huge coffee stain on it. I wish they would of just told me or offered a wet towel to help me clean it up.",

Unfortunately they did a poor job, at least for us.    My wife specifically requested breakfast at Famous Toastery even when the kids and I offered to make breakfast at home.  We had great experiences at the other locations, especially in Concord.  Since we live only five minutes from the Ballentyne location we made plans for Sunday breakfast.  There was a short wait at 9:00 which is to be expected.  We were seated at a table which may have been either too small for a party of four or had too many things left on it from previous guests.  We had to stack things ourselves just to have room for the basics.  I am not sure why creamer, ketchup, and a whole variety of jellies had to remain on the table.  The bread basket and empty smaller plates were not removed until we were half done with our meal.  The two things that just left a bad taste in my mouth was the fact that they did not even come by to refill our coffee until we were about to walk out and the way they brought the check.  The Server who brought the food just tossed the ticket at the table as he walked away.  It just felt tacky and impersonal, like \"hurry up and get out\".    While I understand it is crowded and people may feel rushed, they should also remember there was a reason people wanted to go there for their Mother's Day breakfast.  In this case the food was ok, nothing special, but the service really sunk the experience.  It is unfortunate as we eat at Hawethornes often and live so close but it will be awhile before we give this place another shot.",

Not many healthy alternatives. For $3.50 you can order a fruit cup which probably had $0.50 of fruit in it. All that said, the place is very conveniently located in an area where there's not much competition yet...So more thank likely, I'll return.",

After I placed the order, I saw other tables were offered the corn bread as usual, and the table next to me even got an extra basket. Still no one even bother to ask me whether I want corn bread or not. Despite I usually paid 20% tips, this is the different treatment I received.

My friends brought me here while I was in town for a weekend. I had the goat cheese and herb omelet and asked for mushrooms in it.  It's a GREAT omelet and the addition of the shrooms helped balance out the significant amount of goat cheese.  The omelets come out perfectly as you can see in the various photos for this place. They make their own bread so....get some toast because it's damn good (note: an order is 1 slice not 2).  They also give you complimentary chunks of cornbread which I did not try but my wife really enjoyed it.  The cornbread comes with...apple sauce and we all thought that was weird.  We were expecting honey butter or something like that but whatevs, it's free and people like it.    I would 100% return to this place as it was so delicious. Oh and the home fries are perfect with some soft pieces, some crunchy pieces and a lot of flavor.   One teensy complaint is a 4 seat table is way too small for their large plates.

The food itself is pretty good, and it's great that they offer gluten-free options. But this last time, we felt very rushed to vacate our table. We waited 20 minutes to get our full order, which was delivered to us in \"phases\".  The next 40 minutes while we were eating, we were approached by three staff members reminding us that we were supposed to pay at the front. The last person picked up our ticket and literally threw it back on our table.  I've never encountered this type of rude behavior before but it's certainly out of line when you are shelling out $17 per person for breakfast.  I won't be going back.",

A similar breakfast costs $6/7 at three other Mom & Pop stores around town. With that said I also need to add that service was poor.

I had the black bean burger wrap with avocado and pesto pasta salad- YUM YUM YUM!!!!!  Very fresh, flavorful and unique.  The service was top notch.  Several people would make sure our drinks were full at all times and would check on us frequently.  I'll definitely be back!!!",

She said the food was wonderful and a pretty good value for $6.99.  I got the Combo, one pancake, one egg any style, and four pieces of bacon.  There were two issues.  I asked for the egg poached and runny.  Received an egg pretty close to being hard boiled.  No runny yolk at all.  Okay.  I didn't complain.  The pancake was somewhat large and tasted good as well as the bacon.  The second issue was the price of my meal.  For one pancake, one egg and four pieces of bacon, its $9.99.  Way, way overpriced! Idk.  There are so many bfast places in CLT that give much more food at a cheaper price AND the food is good.  We won't be going back any time soon.  I gave it 3 stars because my daughter loved her sandwich.",

If you mess up the hollandaise sauce, the whole breakfast is shot and this was definitely a terrible hollandaise sauce that was thin, runny and tasted off.  The hash brown portion was skimpy as well as greasy and tasted like they were reheated from another time.  Hubby's omellette was cold, but he did say it tasted good.  I'll give the servers 5 stars for friendliness.  I agree with other feedback that you definitely feel rushed to get out and free up the table.  The manager did stop us on the way out to ask how our meal went, but who wants to tell him the truth and make this breakfast experience even worse.  I would recommend having a questionnaire card on the table.  Would I go back there?  Doubt it.",

    "text": "I've been to Toast Ballantyne five or six times.  The food is okay; one time my potato hash browns had a piece of black netting cooked into it, but my server apologized and I didn't hold it against them (I've been back a few more times since that incident).  However, their hostess this weekend 3/14/2015, was a very unpleasant individual.  My party (a group of 5) arrived and were told it would be a 15 minute wait for breakfast (we arrived to the hostess stand around 10:50 am).  All the other groups that arrived to put their names in the same time as me were told the same approximate wait time.  After waiting about 30 minutes, I observed that all the other people who arrived at the same time as me were already seated and people who had arrived much later than my party were now being seated.  I asked the hostess again, how much longer until we would be seated (without looking to see where were on the list), told me a little while.  After 40 minutes (11:30), I asked again, and was told if my group of 5 wanted to squeeze at a table for 4 we could be seated \"when that table is done\" the hostess said pointing at a table that was still eating.  By this point, I had watched several groups of 4 that had arrived much later than my group, get seated (at 4-top tables) and was very insulted that after waiting so long we were now going to have to squeeze into a table too small for us (that we should have been offered before all those other groups.  When I asked the hostess, if we were going to be squeezed at a 4-top, when did she seat others before us, she tried to lie and tell me \"no we are going down the list in order.\"  I could see that was not the case by looking at the list (and seeing multiple names crossed off the list under my name) and by standing there for 40 minutes and observing people coming in, waiting, and being seated.  Meanwhile, as new people came in to put their names down, she was still telling them a 15-20 minute wait.  I find that hard to believe when I had already waited 40 minutes.    I understand the weekends are busy.  I was more than happy to wait to get seated (especially the 15 minute wait I was told).  But I don't appreciated being ignored by the hostess, brushed off when asking how much longer (after 30 minutes of waiting) and watching other groups come in, but their names on the wait list, and get seated.  Then, after a 40 minute wait, to get offered a 4-top table that other people were still seated at and eating (and told it would be a few more minutes).  An apology by the hostess for the delay, or for skipping over us, would have been nice.  Instead the condescending way she addressed me and offered me a table (that people were still seated at and eating) after a 40 minute wait was too much.  I will never go back to Toast.  I will never recommend it to anyone.",

The service is very efficient and all the wait staff seems to work as a team (anyone will refill your coffee or fill any immediate need you may have). Prices are very reasonable and the food is above average, By that I mean their eggs, coffee, corn bread, fruit, etc. are all better than what you would expect from a popular price restaurant - most breakfast entries were $8 and under- but the fruit salad was as good as you have at home, if you had a well stocked kitchen. The place is perfect for young families as service is fast and prices are very moderate. Not only will your children like it but you can bring the grandparents as they will be the only ones who will recognize the music playing.  If you find their food is not up to your very high standards then breakfast at The Gallery or Cafe Monte or Zebras and pay two times Toast's prices; for me Toast hits the sweet spot between quality and price,",

That being said, the corn beef hash at this place makes my friggin' mouth water. I added an extra egg to my order (2 extra bucks :/) and switched out the toast for an everything bagel (.50 cent up-charge), because I like a little extra heft in my breakfast meals. It did not disappoint. Abso-friggin-lutely delicious. It was so soft and flavorful. You may have to take the discernment of my tastebuds with a grain of salt on this one though, as I started out with one of their Rumosas and that thing liked me almost as much as I liked it.  Not only was it tasty but it had me feeling quite nice on a Saturday morning after just one. Overall, everything went pretty well. We got there and were told there was a 20 minute wait, however, we were seated in 15. Started off with some free cornbread with an apple cinnamon spread     and our food came out lightening quick after that. The servers were pretty attentive and you could tell they were all keeping an eye on the table. It's a little on the pricer side for breakfast, but I say the food was well worth it. I'm glad I now live close by, I'll be stopping in again for sure.",

    "text": "At noon, I approached the hostess and let her know I was a party is 2. She said it would be 20-25 min. No big deal. 30 min later I checked in to see how far down we were. She said there's 1 party of 2 in front of us. 50 min after arrival, I'm hangry, but keeping my cool. I went up to the see where we were at because there are empty 2 tops that I can see. She tells me that we're next, but they were told not to seat anyone because the kitchen is so backed up with orders, we'd just be sitting there anyway.   Weeeeelllll... at least I'd be able to get an Adult sized coffee in lieu of the Dixie cups sippers they leave outside!!!!  However, I kept my cool and didn't say anything & sit back down. Just then, after being told they are not seating anyone, she calls out a party of 6. Just as I turn to look at my wife in sheer astonishment, she calls out a party of 2.   BUT NOT MY PARTY OF 2!!!!!  So after being told 20-25 min, I waited 50 min to not even get a table in the end.   Then after being told they weren't seating anyone at the moment, they sat 2 parties. One of which was a 2 top.   Plus after being told I was next, they sat another 2 top, mind you after I was told they weren't seating anymore tables at the moment. Then they sat 2 parties before I even made it back to my waiting chair.   Terrible terrible terrible!!!",

The only positive is that our waitress was quick about getting our drinks, taking our orders, and getting our complimentary cornbread to us efficiently. Plus the cornbread was the only decent thing we ate. After that, we never saw our waitress again......  I ordered two eggs sunny-side up with grits, bacon, and breakfast potatoes. The eggs were fine. For the grits, I had to submerge them with salt and butter for them to have flavor. The bacon........same consistency as beef jerky. The breakfast potatoes were hard and cold with no flavor. So all I ate basically was half a cup of grits and eggs.   My boyfriend had the California Eggs Benedict. He said it was just okay. We never got a refill the entire time we were there on our drinks. We also waited 45 minutes to get our food. We will not be back.",

    "text": "We've been going to FT for brunch for a couple of years, and the food has *generally* been pretty good.   The last two trips have been disappointing. On our most recent visit, on a weekday, my wife ordered the western BLT, and got a different sandwich. I ordered the Florentine Benedict the last two visits. I ordered it a second time in hopes that the first was an unusual occurrence. Nope. Same both times. The eggs were hard poached instead of oozing. I don't know what the sauce was, but it wasn't Hollandaise--not even a hint of lemon.   As I said, the food at FT is generally pretty good, but until they get a chef who knows how to poach an egg and make a decent Hollandaise, I'd avoid the Benedicts. They're just awful.  FT tried to make it right by cutting the check in half, but all that meant was we paid half price for unacceptable food. We reduced the tip because our waiter didn't check in even once after we were served.   So disappointing, considering how good the place has been in the past.",

There really isn't much room to wait inside the restaurant so we actually went next door to The Butchers Market to kill some time (this was actually pretty fun as the butchers market has some really cool stuff!).   The menu had a lot of good options. I settled on the Cali-Benny. It is a Benedict with egg, tomato, avocado, and came with a side and I chose the grits. Yummy. Apparently a popular option is their Avocado Benny, which is basically a sliced avocado with egg inside. I almost went with this because it sounds super yummy, but it had Cajun spices which turned me away. Maybe on my next visit.  Their only downside is service is pretty slow. It was a Saturday and was pretty busy, but there were a few times when we were actively looking for our server. Other than that, a really tasty option!",

Toast takes a holistic approach to customer service meaning no one server is your waiter, every waiter serves every table. If a server sees you need a refill they get it with out you having to ask. If you need anything to go with your meal, there is always a server right there to help. Probably the best omelette in the area.",

    "text": "Stopped by this location en route to a doctors appointment in the Pineville area. I was in search for vegan breakfast options and there were certainly slim pickings in the area. I love famous toastery but hadn't been since adopting a vegan diet. I perused the menu and figured I could probably finagle a vegan breakfast.   I ordered the fruit cup, bagel with peanut butter and the potatoes without butter.  Everything turned out really good. I was especially surprised by the potatoes. It wasn't their typical potato perfection. But they were delicious nonetheless especially considering that this is an off-the-cuff vegan work-around.  The fruit cup was delicious and fresh as always.  My least favorite thing was the bagel not because of the flavor but because of the thickness. It was definitely a \"roll with a hole\" but the thinner half was a perfect conduit for the peanut butter.   All in all a good clutch vegan meal and would probably work if I had to come here with family or friends for breakfast.  They still hold the title as one of my top breakfast spots in Charlotte.  The only reason this location didn't get the five stars that university location did (see my review) is because my server was a bit short and gruff. He wasn't altogether horrible, just not the best.  Even still, when I have my appointments on this side of town I will definitely stop in for breakfast.",

And it looks like they cook the ingredients separate then throw it together.

Having just recently relocated down here, I was thrilled to find a Toast here in Ballantyne. Went yesterday, and the food is as good as I remembered. The specials are original and interesting, as is the menu. The food was FRESH and flavorful. And the service was outstanding. Also, loved that they feature artwork of a local artist on the walls. This place is a great find!",

And size...it is pretty cramped inside and you kind of feel like you are eating with the table next to you.  With that said...the menu is fantastic and the food is a-ma-zing!  They bring out some yummy cornbread while you wait for you meal, and the food didn't take long at all on a busy Saturday morning.  I ordered an omelet, it was cooked perfectly and they let me modify it from what was on the menu.  I will be back!",

If you were a regular and gave up, come on back. Delighted we can make this part of our weekly routine again.   Old review: My wife and I have been regulars for years (before and after band loved this place. Recently the service (mostly the kitchen speed) has tanked. We've switched our morning routine to other businesses. If you can't give me good service and speed, then it's not work paying you extra for breakfast. Hope they turn it it around.",

    "text": "I heard a lot of folks at my job talk about \"Famous Toastery\" and out of curiosity I had to give them a try. My first impression walking in was like, hm ok, basic inside. Kind of reminded me of like a old western parlor; which I found pretty cool. When we walked in, it was not that busy, so we was able to get seated within 5 minutes. Once seated we, were greeted by a friendly face. It was my first time there so I was overwhelmed  with the the menu, which had plenty to choose from. I ended up getting an omelette that had tomato, avocado, bacon, and parmesan cheese, grits on the side and a blueberry Flap Jack(soooooo good)  Our food was hot and did not take long! The omelet was amazing, and he blueberry pancake almost had me dancing, it's was kind of like biting into a crispy but soft blueberry corn muffin! The syrup they give you is warm and plenty. I got sweet tea to drink! And my, my, my, I must say, you gotta love the south! Serving sizes were plenty, I barely finished, and I'm a big guy. I forgot to mention I went in with a family of 6.  Needless to say, this place will be visited again!   NOW, the only downfall... PLEASE LOWER YOUR PRICES juusssst a tad bit! .",

Normally would have turned right around and left but we were starved since we had not had breakfast or lunch and it was probably close to 1 or 2 pm.  Anyway, place was dingy and had a bit of an odor but again against my better judgement we ordered.  Had eggs and potatoes with rye toast.  Time is now 4:45 and I've had stomach cramps and you can guess what else since we left. In fact as my husband was paying I said pay quick. I need to get home fast! Although our server was very sweet and did a good job, our food was cold the second it was placed in front of us. Lastly, they were sweeping while we were eating. I understand you need to keep the restaurant clean but that is an opening and closing job with minor touch ups. No one wants to eat while you're pushing dirt around and every single one of us agreed. Overall very disappointed with this experience.   Needless to say we won't be back.  Looks like management may have changed since we've been there.  I would say there are a million better places to go. I would steer clear.",

    "text": "I had the Blah-Blah-Blah Omelet, where you build your own omelet for $11. Unfortunately, you can only choose 3 ingredients total before there's a $1 extra charge for every additional ingredient. Omelets are meant to have multiple ingredients. I could understand about charging extra for adding more meat, but there should be no additional charge for adding cheap items like cheese and vegetables! I chose artichokes, lox, and brie. It comes with grits, breakfast potatoes, or fruit plus toast. My grits were bland, but I did enjoy the chunky texture. It tasted like bland porridge. The omelet was cooked perfectly. The combo that I chose tasted great. Loved the gooey cheesiness and the many bits of salmon. I thought the artichoke would be an odd ingredient to add in an omelet, but it surprised me in a good way. I could taste each ingredient, and they all worked well together.  Boyfriend had the Famous Hash (corned beef and shredded potatoes topped with 2 eggs prepared in any style and hollandaise with a side of toast for $11.30). What a great combo! Boyfriend added an extra egg (because you simply can never have enough eggs), but that was an extra $2. I mean, SERIOUSLY?! It's just ONE extra egg. I could buy a whole dozen for two dollars!! Anyway, my boyfriend was thoroughly satisfied with his dish, and I managed to enjoy a few bites of it as well.  We were also surprised with a bowl of complimentary cornbread with apple cinnamon spread. It was not the greatest cornbread, and actually a bit dry, but we appreciated it nonetheless.  We also tried Rumosa (mango rum, orange juice, and house champagne, $6.50) from their Specialty Drinks menu. It was delicious! If you like sweet drinks, give this a try!  Prices are high, and the food is not great enough to justify the prices, but the food is still good. The exterior is beautiful, but I wish the interior had more natural light coming in, or simply more light in general, especially during the brunch hours. The wait was not long, but there is not much room to wait inside. Staff was pretty attentive, though it was confusing at the end whether or not we were supposed to bring our check to the front or not.",

Finally on the the fourth attempt the server recommended something they did have (strawberry French toast). My wife said it was bland and imagined that they had a tub of Walmart strawberry cream cheese in the back and just smeared it on her soggy French toast. I ordered Huevos Rancheros. They brought me a bowl (with a soup spoon) of black bean soup with two runny eggs on top. There were diced tomatoes (their version of salsa I guess) on the side of the plate. Bland. Bland. Bland. I put about Tablespoon ok Texas Pete's on top but, it didn't help. I did discover 4 tortilla chip slivers beneath the soup. I'm a big guy and usually finish whatever is put in front of me. Couldn't even get half way through... won't be going back. There are far better breakfast restaurants in the area",

This toast never arrived.   Never in my life have I been so indignant. This restaurant is called Famous TOASTery, and they didn't include my TOAST. Their toast did not rise to fame with such truancy, I'm sure.   When I woke up this morning, the possibility that Famous TOASTery would omit this item from my lunch was not even CONCEIVABLE. This has fundamentally altered my paradigm, and such earth-shaking intransigence cannot go without comment.  After calling my therapist to work through this episode, my teammates were able to assuage my apoplexy. Needless to say, until reparations are paid, I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  Famous Toastery? More like Famous LACK OF Toastery!  #Toastgate",

    "text": "So this is our second time here and it took me a long time to come back because I was honestly very unimpressed the first time around. The only reason were here today is because I am starving, it's close, The Liberty closed down, and we've been to Flying buscuit a few too many times.  They have quite a few menu options so it was hard for me to make a decision but that's a good thing. Though I didn't get it because I'm trying to watch my calories I was pretty happy to see smoked sausage on the menu. I also like the fact that they offer both turkey sausage and turkey bacon as healthy options.  I got the \"create your own\" omellette option and opted for brie, turkey bacon, tomatoes and onions. I had to add a little salt and pepper but after that it was good. The turkey bacon was a reaaaaaaally good quality. I chose breakfast potatoes over grits and was really glad I did. They are very well seasoned and didn't need the ketchup but adding it made it even more amazing.  My wife got the avacado Benedict which is a really great healthy option. Instead of English muffins they put your eggs and cheese into avocado halves and top it with pico de Gallo. They also add Cajun seasonings. Makes for a really great party in your mouth. Not enough Pico though. Had to request more.  All in all, we weren't blown away but the food was much better than the first time around. We are not rushing to come back but we are definitely open to trying a few more menu items now.",

We were told the wait time would be around 25 minutes which was cool, but it actually turned out to be more like an hr.  Once we finally did get seated, I must say their service is great. The motto \"Where every server is your server\" holds True as someone was checking on us every couple of minutes. For my order, I went with a sausage, cheddar, and tomato omelette and grits. The omelette was flavorful and cooked well. The grits were more along the lines of just standard greats. Others in my party raved about the stuffed french toast as well. I'll definitely be going back at a hopefully less crowded time next time.",

I will give it to the fact that they either had turnover in management or just highly ineffective service. The restaurant was half full and we (2 people) had to wait 15 minutes to sit down. It was like no one was communicating to other people that tables were done and get them ready to serve.  Nevertheless, after ordering we had to wait even more!! We even over heard the waiters apologizing to another table that sat down before us about the wait in food. In total what should be an hour max brunch/lunch turned into two hours with all the waiting.   So I must talk about the food as well. It was sub-par at best. I got the breakfast bowl and it was bland and slightly soggy. I am not a professional cook and my food taste so much better! I am in no rush to ever go back and I highly recommend other places for your brunch/lunch.   This is shocking for me to even say because the other location in Dilworth is so much better! I can't apologize for being to harsh when it was below okay.",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too high walking in but It was just ok to me. First thing you should know is you don't have a set, single server here. All the employees kinda take care of all the tables. We had a waitress take our order and then no one came by for about 30 minutes until the food came out. In that time we had no refills on drinks and just sat there wondering where the waitress had went. Well she never came by again lol. We had others stop by to see if we needed anything after that but I just didn't expect that.   My sister and I had ordered the creamsicle mimosa. It sounded amazing on the menu but we both were sadly disappointed. It tasted just like a creamy regular mimosa, mostly just cream and champagne. It needed more orange flavor. I squeezed an orange slice into it that came with the breakfast and then it tasted a little better.   For my brunch entree I ordered the corned beef and hash. It came with two eggs and hollandaise sauce on top. Eggs were cooked perfectly how I wanted them. It had good flavor but the corned beef hash was more like corned beef bits (like bacon bits) instead of pieces. It was chopped so tiny that it was mostly the potato hash with a hint of corned beef. If it had bigger pieces it would have been delicious! My husband had an omelet which he liked but it was pretty standard. Now on the other hand my sister had ordered an \"avocado omelet\" and it literally had one little piece of avocado. They should have called it a tomato omelet, very stingy on avocado here.   The bill for my husband and myself was $33 plus tip so we spent $40 on breakfast and it was just ok. Not bad food by any means, it was good, but I've had better for cheaper.",

Parking in this lot was fair for the morning but I could see it getting crazy in the afternoon with all of the other businesses.   Oddly this location seemed a bit dark and gloomy compared to the other location - almost as if lights were out on one side of the restaurant. The hostess almost seated us on the dimly lit area of the restaurant, until my mom spoke up saying she wanted to sit by the window. The hostess accommodated us and left to return to the stand.   It took a couple of minutes before someone came to take our order. Granted it was Sunday, but it was earlier than the regular brunch time. This time I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of the potatoes.   I don't know if the team was having a little bit of trouble with the kitchen or an off day, but we had to ask for a few of the items we ordered when only part of the order came out. My folks discovered their omelettes came with dry toast that hadn't been toasted and asked someone to please pop them into the toaster for a bit to crisp it up. No one on the staff was rude, but I noticed some seemed a bit sluggish or out of it, compared to the Tryon staff.  Biscuits and gravy were very good. Potatoes ranged between cooked and not fully cooked.   My mom said if we had dined at this location first, she thinks she would have written off the Famous Toastery completely, due to the subpar food and service. I'm hoping they're just trying to work out the kinks with this space and maybe had an oddball day.",

    "text": "Out of town with family and wanted to try the local spot. We checked yelp for recommendations and saw that Famous Toastery got some good reviews.   We got to the area and it was in a quaint spot. There was a lot of people waiting and even people waiting outside.  There was a great coffee station outside for people to get a shot of coffee while they wait. I thought it was a nice touch.  We waited about 25 minutes for our table and we were seated. The restaurant was hot, but I could be because of where we were seated.  The waitress came and took our drink order and welcome us to the restaurant.   A waiter came  to take our food Order and answer menu questions. We ordered different things.   I ordered  the blueberry flapjack combo with bacon and scrambled eggs with goat cheese.   My first flapjack was burnt on the bottom, but they quickly fixed it. The second batch was absolutely delicious.   It was great to try a new place.",

    "text": "We were so disappointed!! My husband and didn't feel like making our own breakfast this morning so we trekked out to Famous Toastery, which should change its name. The menu looks great, and the servers were all very nice, and the food tasted fine, but that's about it.  We knew coming on a Sunday around 11:30 might mean a little bit of a wait and we were okay with that. But when we went in to put our name on the list, they told us 35 min wait despite the restaurant only being half full - not an exaggeration either. Should have been clue #1. So they called our name about 30 min later and we were seated and our drinks were brought promptly. Had two waiters ask us within 30 seconds if we were ready to order, but I hadn't even put sugar in my coffee yet, so not quite. Eventually someone circled back to us and we ordered a crab cake eggs Benedict, a side of a biscuit and gravy and a side of French toast.   45 MINUTES LATER the waitress told us there was one ticket in front of ours and it would be out shortly. She also told us hey have been having problems in the kitchen recently. Yea no kidding. Also, it appeared that some of the tables were offered and given toast or cornbread baskets for the table while they waited for food, but we were not given that option, which made us even grumpier.   As for the food: French toast was fine, biscuit and gravy was fine. The poached eggs we ordered as medium were well done and not runny at all. The crab cakes were a bit dry and small (like silver dollar small). The menu said just egg on the crab cake, which is fine to skip the English muffin, but we expected a little bigger than what we got.   On the way out, my husband noticed another table yelling at a manager. I can only assume about how absurdly long it took to get food at a restaurant that remained half full.   In addition to the wait, I'm pretty sure their AC wasn't working because we were sweating by the time our food came.  We will not be back, at least to this location.",

We enjoyed the buttermilk waffle (as a special, not on the regular menu) and eggs Benedict.  The waffle was OK but did not look complete as if kitchen hadn't used/didn't have enough batter.  Bacon was plentiful but a bit limp and not crispy.  The judgment on the Benedict was the eggs initially tasted of the vinegar used during the poaching process (not pleasant) but that flavor faded.  The hash browns are the big, chunky kind often described more as breakfast potatoes.  Be forewarned if you're expecting the shredded potato dish.  Meal was pricey ($35 plus tip for all of the above plus coffee, tea and two small OJs) so I don't see making this a weekly stop.  But for an occasional meal with someone special, I'd go back.",

    "text": "I must say with great emphasis: brand-new restaurants simply write their own obituaries by leaving first-time customers dissatisfied.  Granted, it's location ensures it's main clientele are (rich) families and really fucking old people. But I'm almost certain they won't last longer then a year or two, or further the demise of turning this into a franchise, as they're assiduously trying to do.  Newly-minted Toast Cafe just opened in Ballantyne in the heart of urban planning identity-crises, \"Village at Robinson Farm\". Having tired out the Flying Biscuit over the years (more on that later), and disgusted with the strange sushi-pizza menu at Cosmos Cafe, I eagerly hoped this would be my new breakfast/lunch place.  I came here starving, and left, still starving.  We ordered:      Half Portobello Mushroom Sandwich w/ Jack Cheese & Sauteed Onions on a Kaiser Roll and Tomato Soup - $8.99     Half Turkey Sandwich and Soup - $8.99  The portions were tiny. And the Portobello mushroom sand I gulped in about two bites. Here, you get exactly what you order, no flair. Which can be fine, but summoned my few mushrooms with an overload of cheese. I saw NO SIGHT of onions. Yup. And the kaiser roll was more like-- the cheapest, paper thin white bread you could find. The tomato soup was pretty boring as well.  As a chef, I have an obsessive tendency to calculate the costs of the food I'm given. I paid nearly $10 for a tiny, tiny sandwich and a bit of tomato soup - prob cost them $1.50 max to make.  I left disgruntled, despite an overwhelming number of ppl asking me, \"How is the food?\". Yup, on their website they pride themselves on having not just \"one waiter\" per table. Which means, a barrage of different ppl asking me about the food when I'm actually not happy at all. It was boring and stupid pricey for what you get.  I also HATED the \"look\" of this place, these bland suburban paintings that aren't really paintings. Like really asinine peach and gold and beige colored things. You know, restaurant owners who open places with absolutely no creative spark. The space is huge-- but suffocated by the kind of furniture you buy at Target. The over-cosy pseudo-European shit that Europeans wouldn't actually use.",

    "text": "After hearing great things about the other locations, I was really stoked to check out the new location at Robinson Farm in Ballantyne. It's a quaint location with plenty of seating and great for a nice breakfast, brunch or lunchy style meal.   Made it in on Sunday afternoon around 1pm and it was packed. There was a small wait, but a table for two opened up in less than 10 minutes. All of the seating is spread around and a little odd for access/maneuvering. Not a huge deal.   I ordered the California chicken salad and really enjoyed it. Lots of great flavors - goat cheese, walnuts, avocado, good greens and the dressing was fantastic. Really impressed with this salad. I'd order it again upon next visit.   The downsides were the service and my wife's food. She ordered an omelet that had guac and I'm pretty sure the avocados were on their way out. Just a really odd flavor for guac that didn't seem right. We ended up removing most of it from her omelet and everything was fine. Just kind of odd. Also, the service was just a little slow. It was slammed, but our server didn't come back to take our order, refill drinks, or bring the check in a timely manner each time. It took about 10 minutes for him to come back to take our order and around the same each time after that. Not a huge deal, but an hour long brunch for the style that Toast is was a little much.   I can't say I'm rushing back to eat here, but wouldn't rule it out completely. Think they'll get some things worked out after having a few months under their belts. Cheers!",

    "text": "After the previous resident closed (thank goodness), we were excited to find that Toast was opening here.  The entry area is very small and is a bit nuts when busy, and for some reason the front door is super hard to open, and doesn't have a push/pull sticker, so they have a lot of issues with people not being able to get in or out easily.    Once seated (at a small table right near the waiting area in front--not very desirable), we were greeted and served.  The service was good, but not great.  The menu is decent with a good many options, and the price point is good.  The food was good and served pretty quickly considering how busy it was.  Here is my issue.  To make it in this area with so many breakfast places, you HAVE to be extra good at something, or offer a menu that is different with some really stand-out items.  This had neither. Yes, the food was good and the space was fun, but there was nothing that made me say..hey!  This is my new breakfast spot.  It was just ok/average/good.   I was hoping for something like super service, or an unusual menu, or the food to be mouth-watering.  It lacked a bit in those areas.  I will go back and try a few more things, but they have got to step up their game if they will survive here in Ballantyne.",

Also noted all the good reviews Toast had received, so we were optimistic. The restaurant was busy when we got there, but we were still able to get seated right away.  It has a casual family friendly atmosphere and is very clean.  Our breakfast started off well. The coffee was good and so was the cornbread they brought out for the table.  But the rest of our meals was substandard. The waffle came out soggy, and the batter had too much of an egg batter flavor. It was as if they mixed up the crepe batter for waffle batter. The sausage patties were on the watered down bland side. My eggs Benedict were over cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was over the top with dill, and underachieved in zest. I don't think they do much scratch cooking in the kitchen. At least it didn't taste like it, and I didn't smell anything yummy coming from the kitchen.  And our table was close enough to the kitchen doors to have had smelled some food aromas - but there were none.    The manager took the waffle back to the kitchen and took it off the bill, and that was appreciated. Our waiter was attentive and our coffee mugs stayed warm and filled.  So those are the positives.  We may give it another shot, just to see if we caught them on a bad morning.  But if the quality is that of packaged reheated food, we will cross it off our list.",

We were quoted 15--20 minute wait, but it was much closer to 35 minutes. Luckily, we did not have the hunger horns out.  It is a good idea to quote better wait times or you can have some unhappy campers. Once seated, we received service from a number of servers. We did not know if this is the standard or due to being newly opened. We tried savory and sweet choices. The food and coffee were pretty good. I agree with Julia M., that complimentary cornbread should  have been served warm with butter/  jam or something-- will decline next time.  We will come back and try some of the other entrees. Service was decent, but really slow. Hopefully things will get better as their feet are wetter.",

I have had some things that left me disappointed but 9 times out of 10 I leave full, satisfied and NOT broke.    One of my favorite dishes is the peanut butter/banana french toast.  I mean, can you go wrong with that combination?  I also love their breakfast burritos and their scrambler skillets.  The one I tried this past weekend had jalapenos, cheese, and chorizo.  It was delicious.  I am also typically a fan their \"specials.\"  They have very good crepes, specialty pancakes, quiches, etc.  They offer a wide variety of breakfast/brunch/lunch items and they are typically pretty scrumptious.  The service is good and personal.  The owner of Ballantyne and Park road locations is a very nice guy that seemed to recognize us after only meeting us one time.  Our most recent visit to the Ballantyne location we met the owner's brother who is apparently the new manager.  He was VERY friendly and seemed genuinely interested in his customers.  I really like these fellas and their food.  That's all.  goodbye.",

It was pretty crowded when we got there but the wait was only ten minutes. There is also free coffee too while you wait. When you sit down they bring you a basket of cornbread with some cinnamon apple jam, it was very good.   For my meal i had the \"Cali Benny\", a California twist on the traditional eggs benedict, complete with tomato and avocado. It was soo sooo goood! They poach your egg to your preference as well. I had mine cooked medium and it was perfect, runny but not too runny. It came with a side of hashbrowns which were delicious as well.   I can't wait to go back! The lunch menu looked good as well, a large selection.",

    "text": "A few lunches that were excellent.  Great menu, and I mean really, really great!  A myriad of breakfast and lunch choices such that you will have to force yourself to narrow down to four or five that you want and then experience the equivocation in selecting the final choice.  They had a special of fresh lobster roll.  In Charlotte?  I was getting out there, feeling very brave and went for it.  It was amazing.  Two soft rolls literally stuffed with lobster, two, not just one.  I asked the waitress and she said it was 3 ounces of meat.  Very generous.  And the meat was all claws and legs, no shreds from the body.   Quite a luxury. And a yummy mayo kind of sauce.  Soups are home made and are unusual combos.  The one I had once was corn, avocado and more, which was pretty scary, but worth having a bowl for a meal.  This experience is pretty common at Toast.  Burgers are large enough that the wait people will discourage parents ordering one for each child.  Nope.  Split it and the kids can't eat all of that.  We big kids revel in these half-pounders.  Coffee is rich and strong, like the big coffee shops.  Flavorful and the way coffee should be.  I don't do desserts, but looking around at others who do became a temptation.  Am certain that the devil  has a part in those desserts.  Breakfasts give you the standards, but also have clever, unusual choices which make breakfasts more than just a first meal of the day.  Served all day.  Too bad it is just a breakfast & lunch place. No dinner service.  One small note:  the wait staff work, very effectively, as a team.  As their menu states:  You don't have your waiter, you have our waiters.  Doesn't matter who walks by, you can ask for more coffee, a fork or whatever and they get it.  Your tips go into on pot, whether cash on the table or into the jar at the cash register.",

Once it was extremely False seating estimates (we were told 20 minute wait time) for half an hour straight, when we finally asked to see where our name was on the list, it was behind over a dozen other names and no way would it have ever been 20 minutes. The family in front of us was also told 20 minutes and they waited over an hour until they were seated.   Another time the food was just extremely underwhelming. Something I could have just as easily whipped up at home (and I'm no chef) in half the time for a fraction of the cost.   It's a shame because I really wanted to like this place after our positive first experience but it just kept going down hill.",

If you want your Bloody Mary spicy, you have to ask or just add hot sauce yourself. I got the Breakfast burrito and biscuits with gravy. Probably, best biscuits study gravy I've ever had. It's just so good, you just keep wanting more of it.  I would give this place 5 stars but the service was off. I was not sure who was my waiter/waitress. Whenever I got that figured out, my waitress seemed tired or something because she did not interact with us at all.  I wanted to order another Bloody Mary but she was never around to check on us so I went up to the bar to order one. A gentlemen told me I had to order from my waitress.....problem...she never checks on our table. I do know the waitress's name but she needs to cheer up.   I love this place and would recommend it to anyone, hopefully you won't have the same waitress I did.",

The food however isn't great and neither are the mimosas...it could be that I ordered the wrong things but nothing I've eaten here has been outstanding.  They serve these little corn cake muffins while you wait for your food which is awesome, but they weren't tasty.  The mimosas are pretty big but again, not tasty.  They weren't very bubbly and taste like they were made with old wine instead of sparkling wine.  I usually love corned beef hash and ask for it well done so the edges are a bit crispy... Not only was it not well done but they smothered it in hollandaise sauce.  I guess I should have read the menu closer.  They do have gluten free options which is nice and the service is always great which is what makes me come back.  Next time I'll just try pancakes",

We were charged for three large orange juices when we only got two. After asking the cashier to fix it, she did not.

The dining room was 25% occupied. I was surprised when a server asked for the spare menu on my table. It seemed more important to him to grab the extra menu than offer to take my drink order. Fortunately, a more personable server came to take my order and bring my beverages. The coffee was okay, but I have to say that I have not had coffee served with a soup spoon in it before. The spinach mushroom omelette was supposed to have Gruyere cheese - I did not see or taste it. No seasoning either. The fruit was not sweet and there was no offer of butter for my thin cinnamon raisin toast. The cashier did take $1 off for the absence of cheese in my omelette.",

Great California Benedict, super tasty. The only negatives were the wait & feeling a bit rushed as there were so many people waiting...that, & maybe consider slightly bigger tables!

    "text": "This used to be a favorite. Food was always good and service extremely attentive. On my visit this past week, service has clearly been cut to bare bones. We could not even find a server when we needed. It used to be almost overkill...servers were always checking on you. I miss those days. Two requests for a latte finally produced a luke warm one nearly 20 minutes later. Food has always come not quickly. Not this time...25 minutes for an egg white omelet and Huevos rancheros, only for two soft poached eggs to come out slimy and raw on top of the dish. Soft poached is about the yolk, not the white. The egg still needs to be cooked. Twenty minutes  later a new dish was delivered and while the yolks were not very runny, whoever was poaching eggs was clueless. There was no egg white at all. This is a breakfast place. Someone should be able to properly poach an egg. I have had this dish numerous times in the past.  Quality and portions have clearly been cut. How disappointing. Not sure we will return.",

    "text": "I have to admit being slightly disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. My wife had the crab salad special with grits. They brought her grits first, then brought another bowl with the meal. They were quite plane and ordinary, nothing special. They did take her dish back and bring the cucumber salad which was ok. The crab salad didn't really taste of crab but had an overpowering flavour despite a good amount of crab in it. She said the roll tasted better than the crab.   I had the classic eggs Benedict. They have many so I tried the original to compare with other places I've tried. The hollandaise was bland, the eggs undercooked with runny whites. It came with a side of fried potatoes which had their skins on and were delicious with good seasoning and a great fried texture. Oddly enough the coffee was both weak and bitter. Not quite as bad as Cracker Barrel, but not that great either.   Overall, not really worth $40 and I doubt I'd be back.",

    "text": "If you're unsure... toast has more than toast, but oh boy does it do toast well.  And by toast, I mean toast in forms of the word toast... not so much just the traditional side dish for eggs.  But also French TOAST as well.  On this particular morning (brunch) we decided to try it out for the first time with our Yankee friend in tow.  Meaning she was from the north, not that she enjoyed a NY Baseball team. Anyway, they were in the mood for some good food and a mimosa while I was curious how popular toast could be that they named a cafe out of it.  It was a short wait to get seated (maybe 5 mins?), and then once seated service started very quickly with drinks.  As we waited the return of our drink orders we did the typical think of looking around the room to see what looked tasty.  And I couldn't take my eyes off this poor girls BLT (which I didn't get) but it looked so delicious. For the record ma'am, I was eyeballing the stack of bacon on your blt when I was drooling.  In case there were any misconceptions there.  I skipped the drool inducing BLT for a more breakfast item of eggs, toast (duh!), bacon, and some hash browns.    Now, I saw a complaint that the hash browns weren't what someone was expecting and that's True.  I was actually anticipating wafflehouse style hash browns as well.  Instead these are more country potato like.  Which are a bit more hearty, but very delicious!  The eggs were cooked to order and not over-seasoned, so you can dress them up yourself a bit of you'd like.  Tasty none the less. The BACON was thick cut and cooked to perfection as well.  Very good and perfect complement to the dish!  (I can't imagine how great the BLT would have been!) The toast was very good, and very interesting.  It was soft, delicious, and almost gummy - but not in a disgusting wet bread way.  It was weird to describe, but very tasty none the less.  I loved it as my side... especially with a bite of bacon.  (Again, making me want the BLT even more).  So, if you didn't notice, I WILL be back for that BLT.   Our brunch was delicious, and everyone was raving about it.  I can't wait to return and try even more!  You definitely have to try this place out!",

I tried to remedy with the sugar packs, but to no avail.         Front of house staff bussed tables with all fingers  in glasses, which is a major germ spreading process. I hope they have a large budget for hand soap, or someone will get sick certainly soon from suck terrible busing habits.         We were giving the bill as our food arrived, and then the attentiveness of our server was missing in action. I had to get up for coffee refill and napkins. I had to also flag a another server for a fork.         The highlight of the meal, was my wife's burger,  which she loved. It did however fall apart as she ate it, but it was wells seasoned and good quality. The kids liked their Mac and cheese, and the kids menu with activities was a nice touch for keeping the little ones occupied.        I think if Toast would readjust their serving etiquette and busing processes to be more in line with proper service standards, I would give it another try.",

I liked the atmosphere, like a southern hospitality cottage-type setting. It went well with the friendly service we were given by all of the servers there, since none are assigned to a specific table. They all work together to cater to all guests.  We came for breakfast, so I wanted the stuffed French toast. Not a fan of pb, so I asked if I could get a Nutella & banana one instead. Wasn't a problem at all. Cool. But then when my food came out, it didn't look like Nutella. It wasn't as dark. I tasted it, and turns out they do a Nutella + cream cheese mix. Disappointment. I tasted more cream cheese than Nutella. Meh.  3 out of 5 at our table ordered the corned beef hash. They picked the right thing. Definitely better than my french toast. Oh well.",

Pros:  Northwestern egg white omelet with fresh herbs, goat cheese and grilled onions was amazing.  Stuffed French toast was also very good. Could have used a bit more fresh strawberries, but overall flavor and texture was good. Sister said the crab cakes eggs Benedict with Hollandaise was also great, but I thought it looked very low on Hollandaise. If you like sauce, ask for extra. Bloody Mary was flavorful and hearty.   Cons:  They were out of grits, but didn't tell us - instead just substituted hash browns. What breakfast place runs out of grits? I mean, come on... It's not like they're grinding the corn themselves.  Also, the hash browns were not what I consider to be hash browns. They were more like quartered baby potatoes. Big chunks of lightly seasoned and mostly cooked potatoes. I would pass on them if I had a choice.   There was nothing here I couldn't make myself, but I would never be so decadent to do so. For that reason, I will be back.",
