    "text": "Stopped by after shopping to do take out. Saw how extremely nice, clean and authentic inside, I decided to sit down in the bar area to watch boxing. Love Boxing.   My Waiter was very nice, called me \"Senorita\" and just little things aside from not having napkins nor eating utensils, that was quickly resolved.  I could have ordered something more mexican authentic, but for the first time I always order a mixed fajita (chicken, beef and shrimp) to review if I would return.  Well, another post stated it was bits and pieces of scrap meat thrown in; this is correct.  It had NO taste until the middle when it got tastier. The red and green peppers as well as the onions were not overcooked.  That being said, 3 Amigo's had the best mixta fajita over all the Mexican places I've patronized.  Upon leaving, the Mariachi Band was beginning to play, but is was 10:30 and I wasn't drinking.  It would have been nice to hear and watch boxing while eating.  I will return to try another dish as the atmosphere was enlightning.  Hopefully the a new dish will be too.",

No seasoning on anything,  mushy burito, tough steak and cheddar cheese on the refried beans instead of white cheese. Ug!!!! I basically had to beg for salsa because there was such a small amount in the bowls. I'm a slow eater & the waitress acted like it was a waste of her time to wait on me because I was eating alone.  Too bad this is near my home because I will continue to drive on by.",

I had the special margarita and I can say it was the smoothest margarita I have ever had (and I've had plenty).   The free tortilla chips and salsa were very good. We decided to just get appetizers and we were glad we did as the portions were gigantic. I ordered the Fajita quesadilla and could only eat about a third of it! It was very tasty as well.  Our waiter (Usvaldo) was very attentive and informed us of the upcoming events...karaoke  and a live mariachi.  I will definitely be coming back. I went on a Sunday afternoon but would love to go for some drinks/apps on a Friday or Saturday night.",

Normally my wife and I order Mexican food by the numbers, but decided to branch out this time. My wife ordered the Arroz con Pollo and fell in love. Large portions served hot and fast. I ordered the pork Chili Verde and wil be ordering it again on our next visit. Skillfully prepared and great presentation made Don Pedro's a hit with us. The only reason there aren't 5 stars on this review is that the lights were a tad bright. Trivial I know, but if the lighting had been just a bit softer, this would have been a perfect 5.",

I wasnt too hungry so ordered taco salad, which was good, but the meat was a bit bland (but no doubt, still good food... And cheap!), and the hubby ordered carne asada which was delish.

We're from California and Arizona and we're never impressed by the Mexican food in Charlotte but the margaritas here were good enough to keep us coming back.  However, tonight will be the last time we ever return here. The service we experienced tonight was absolutely awful. I know it's cinco de mayo and we expected to run into a bit of a crowd here so we headed out for an early diner. Mid way through our meal they start blasting an Eminem song so loud that you could barely here the person sitting next to you. My three year old was immediately startled and I did my best to console her. The music only seemed to get louder and louder with each song. I asked the hostess what was going on and why the music was so loud and she said \"well it's cinco de mayo.\" I sat back down and tried to finish the rest of my meal. As the music continued to get louder my daughter began to cry because she was so scared by the sheer loudness of it. I had to leave my meal half unfinished and her meal untouched, My husband and two older daughters stayed in the restaurant to finish up.  When the manager came by to speak with my husband he got the same response that I did \"Well it's cinco de mayo, so we have a DJ.\"  I get that it's cinco de mayo. I get that people are out to have a good time. But this a restaurant where many families were eating it. NOT A CLUB. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A DANCE FLOOR. It was the most awful experience ever, only to be made worse by their poor customer service If I could give them zero stars I would. We will definitely never return here again.",

It's a fairly new restaurant to the area, I think it opened about two years ago if I'm not mistaken.  It's also kind of tucked away in a corner, so it's not a place you'll easily see from the road.  ...but despite its limited visibility, the guacamole here is some of the best I've ever had! It's about $5-$7 including tip to have someone come to your table and make guac fresh at your table. Now I realize that a lot of places do this, but Don Pedro's has big portions and something about it just tastes better than the other places!  I am pretty boring when it comes to Mexican restaurants...I always order the exact same thing everywhere I go...and it's not because I'm afraid to branch out....I just really love a cheese enchilada, refried beans, and a chalupa on the side.   The quality of the enchilada is how I rate said Mexican restaurants.  Don Pedro gets a 9/10.  I've always had really attentive service here too and a bountiful amount of chips and salsa.",

The bartender finishes taking our drink order and before leaving he asks, \"On the rocks or frozen?\"  I confirmed, \"Frozen.\"  Later he brings back a pitcher on the rocks.   So I remind him, we wanted frozen.  He takes the pitcher, pours it in the blender, blends it, and pours what fits back in the pitcher.  Half is left in the blender, meaning half of the alcohol we are paying for is still in the blender not to mention the mixture is now watered down and foamy.  When we asked for the remaining half he said, \"No, the pitcher is full that is what you get.  I asked for the manager and he pointed him out.  As I walked to the manager, he sprinted ahead of me to give his side of the story in Spanish.  When he was finished, the manager turned to me and asked, \"what's the problem?\"  So I informed him that we were leaving as a result, to which he argued, \"But the glass was full?\"  I responded, \"I am not here to debate, I'm simply informing you as a courtesy that we are leaving.\"  As a customer I'm not literally paying for the bartenders mistake.  The fact that the manager had his mind made up after hearing the bartenders side of the story first and was abrasive did not sit well with me.  We will not return.",

The chips, salsa and pico de gallo are good. I love getting the fresh guacamole that they prepare at the table in front of you. We went there on a Sunday night once and they were out of avocados. I was devastated, to say the least.  My favorite meal is the chicken chalupa and chicken enchilada combination. Their combinations are the way to go in my opinion. My sister always gets the steak and chicken fajitas. The margaritas are good too and are always on point.  I took off one star because the service can be hit or miss. One time we had several different servers check on us and we asked each of them for another silverware and napkin set because my dad didn't get one. Each of them said yes but never came back. My dad finally had to ask the manager when he came with the food and then he finally got it.   Another time we went and had the opposite issue - the waitress literally checked on us every MINUTE. I wish I was exaggerating.  We could barely have a conversation without her showing up and asking us if we needed something. It was beyond irritating and we all left seriously annoyed! Another time my parents went without me and they served my dad a beer in a HOT mug. He complained and they immediately brought a new one, but seriously? HOT BEER? LOL  So all in all - great food, but needs to work on service issues.",

We decided to try their tres leche cake for dessert hoping that the dessert would save the dinner. The cake (which should be very moist from the different milks) was dry and grainy.

When I get my ticket there was a different amount. Manager would not honor what was told to me by the waiter which was a $3 dollar difference. He then brings out a to go order, I explain I no longer want the food as I no longer feel comfortable eating it after our discrepancy. He would not honor me paying for the food I ate. Management is extremely poor. Food is not great either. If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant go to Azteca or Zapatoes. DO NOT GO TO DON PEDRO ON CHANCELLOR!",

The prices are also perfect, the the servers are the best in the business. Really. The wait staff is that good.  But, the wait staff also dresses in full \"costume\" even for lunch service. Even thought the building is very cool and comfortable, that's just overkill for lunch. C'mon. Get some black t-shirts and let those folks relax!  Also, the decor is SUPERB, but the walkways between tables is CRAZY narrow. This is a great restaurant with a manageable and diverse menu, so maximizing floor space makes perfect sense. But, it's too much. The chairs are great, but take up too much space. Despite the delightful decor, high ceilings and quality service, the center of the main dining room is more reminiscent of a cafeteria.  If you have a party of 4, ask for bar side. The bar area is stunning, and as a *ahem* frequent patron of bars, a nice atmosphere while you are enjoying a margarita (they make a good one) really makes the experience.  Overall, if you are in the UNCC area and have a hankering for quality Mexican food, this is the place to be.",

    "text": "For the people who follow my reviews, I have neglected to recount the experience that really started this entire adventure that my girlfriend and I have made of finding new places to eat.  This was the first place that she took me the first time that I came to visit her in Charlotte, NC.  She claimed that it was better than Guadalajara, a local-to-me Mexican restaurant, mainly because it was authentic (whatever that could mean - she is Spanish, not Mexican!).  I knew from the start that it was going to be interesting, for everyone is dressed up in cultural clothing as you walk in.  When you are seated, they bring you two types of \"salsas,\" one that is what you would expect, and one that I recently heard our server refer to as pico de gallo, although I have always thought of it as some sort of slaw.  Both are incredibly fresh, and if you order the table-side guacamole, you are continuing to take in the fresh flavors that this place has to offer (also the great service, as they will prepare the guacamole to your liking).  Upon my girlfriend's recommendation, we ordered the vegetarian express burrito, a burrito filled with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato, and topped with sauce and guacamole (not as fresh as the table-side guacamole but still delicious).  This burrito is large, large enough that two people can easily split it, especially after filling up with guacamole beforehand.  It is fresh and filling, two things that we look for, being vegetarian.  When you are finished, they bring out little sopapilla-type chips, covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce.  Even if you are full to the brim, you can finish one of these little bites, and it makes for a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  We have definitely come to expect them at the end, knowing exactly how full we will be upon leaving.  One thing I would note is to beware of the large guacamole if you are a party of two for two reasons.  First, there is a potential for it to fill you up and dominate your meal, instead of accentuate it.  Secondly, I noticed after a while that my check was quite high after only ordering one entree, and I figured out that the large guacamole actually costs more than the vegetarian express burrito.  I have given this establishment five stars because, as my girlfriend boldly claimed when we first went there, it is better than Guadalajara.  Everything about this place makes it unique, but it is not unique in any way that makes it seem a little off.  Veronica, a server that we have come to regularly have, knew what we wanted the last time we visited.  We were (stupidly) thinking of trying something new, but in the end, we decided that to us, the vegetarian express burrito was what makes this place so great.  She was happy to know that she remembered our order perfectly, and we were happy to feel so at home.",

We got the enchiladas and the fajitas and they both came with refried beans and rice. The fajitas also had sour cream, a salad, and guacamole.  This place was way bigger than I thought. There was a huge golden room towards the side of the restaurant that looks really gorgeous for a big family. I also thought the uniforms that the waiters and waitresses have to wear are really cute as well.  The only reason I took one star off is the crappy service. We went when they first opened for the day (and on a Tuesday too) so the restaurant was completely dead. They took forever to refill our drinks and take our order. After we were done, we waited quite a bit for the waitress to come over with our bill. Good food but bad service. I would still recommend this place but go during the early lunch hours. If they're this bad when it's dead, the service is probably way worse when they're busy.",

Take in mind that we asked if it was still early enough to get food as they closed in 30 minutes. If they did not have to say yes. With that said, since they said yes, I expect to get what I pay for.  I have attached pics of what they gave us. It's a joke. And we paid $16 for this plate of food. So we could not return the food because they were closed. The next day we took the pictures back to speak to the manager. He was extremely rude and disrespectful. He initially claimed that it was a lunch portion. But the receipt proves otherwise. His response was \"Oh, well then you did it. We did nothing wrong.\" So with that said, I will NEVER eat at any Don Pedro's restaurant again. There are too many other Mexican restaurants out there.",

They began being upset with us because we did not want to eat food that was touched. So we politely asked for the manager who then said we will just be charged for the drinks. Well he lied he being Elias Michel was rude he lied. Not realizing that we understood Spanish and they started speaking poorly about us being broke annoying monkeys. At that point I got upset and I said to everyone let's remove ourselves for the table and stand outside I'm going to call the police. While standing outside he ran up and started a judge confrontation. He got in my face so I walked my kids to my car so I can let them sit there while I tried to resolve the issue. He than started taking pictures of our tags and yelling out broke niggers. As I got in my car to call the police to avoid him yelling and disrespecting me in front of my children and it was my brothers birthday. The police never came so my children began crying wanting to leave they didn't feel safe. So we left! I pray they get addressed this was unfair! No one deserved this! Eli is Michel does not deserve his position he is dangerous and harassing!",

    "text": "My first visit to Don Pedro's was underwhelming at best, but i was in the area today and decided to give it another try. ( I was craving Mexican food and my go-to spot- Three Amigos on Central Ave was too far out of the way)  One thing I've noticed about the typical Mexican restaurants around here- Don P's, Monterey, Zapata's- the local chains- is the service is always rushed.  When I am treating myself to a meal out, I like to relax, have a drink and enjoy some chips and salsa before my food arrives.  I have learned that if I order my meal while ordering my first drink, the microwaved plate of goo usually beats my Margarita to the table.  That said, I put off ordering until I have had my drink, enjoyed some chips and salsa, etc.  This does not stop the waiter- who was very pleasant and friendly- from coming over to my table every 3-4 minutes asking if I am ready to order.  I hate feeling rushed- I rush all day during the week for work, so when i have free time, like to enjoy a less hurried pace.   Anyway, my meal - I ordered off the lunch menu for $6.95- which is  a good value.  I got one taco and a cheese enchilada.  The food, of course came out quickly- fresh out of the microwave.  The ground beef in the taco was of no better taste/quality  than taco bell, and my cheese enchilada was a mushy pile of cheddar cheese.  The food was loaded with salt- and I am a person who like salt and uses it fairly liberally so if it's too salty for me, than well...  The salt overwhelmed the cheese enchilada and re-fried beans.  As for the enchilada, I'm not even sure if it was in a enchilada shell/wrapper- it was so salty and mushy from being microwaved I couldn't tell- no other seasoning, sauce, onions in the enchilada, just the overly salty microwaved cheese.  I will not be back.  Too bad- this place is not too far for me to drive and the space- altho the decor a bit chotzke- is nice, and very clean.  I also like their outdoor patio.  I would return for a margarita and chips on the patio but won't return nor spend money on their microwaved food.",

The service was prompt and adequate to be fair I came late night. I got the milanesa....AMAZING. DEEP FRIED STEAK.  The food put me over the moon and the barkeeps were on it.

This is not going to be my go to place for good Mexican food, only for dining in a fun atmosphere. My go to places for food will be on North Tryon or even On the Border is better. But I think this place did a great job of decorating and creating a good social and relaxed atmosphere.

Next, when we ordered our meal I said I want a lunch special $5.99 (substitute the tostada for an enchilada).  And my friend said the same.  We got our check.  He charged me for a regular margarita ($12) and both of us for a more expensive meal (close to $9).  When I complained about the drink he said I told you about the FRESH margarita.  I was like you saw me looking at the specials you should have explained the difference in price.  I did not realize the difference in price for my meal until I got home.  They are thieves.

This place is definitely a great to come and get a nice meal at a good price. I originally came because me and a coworker were watching a soccer game before heading to work and from the moment I arrived they were always helpful and simply ready for all of our orders. I had the queso dip which was perfect in every aspect. The texture, taste and thickness were simply all on point. Plus, I ordered two mai thais and although strong in alcohol, it was still good. Anyway, I had some fish tacos and let me tell you, although the tacos were small, everything else will get you full. A lot of fish bits, a lot of rice and lots of black beans, I have to say you will end up taking some home. I will have to recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Mexican Food in the University area and you have to stop by so you can get your grub on.",

The outdoor area is great if you have dogs. We would really like to compliment our server, Hector.  Always attentive, his recommendations are always spot on, and he is very efficient.  Hector is also great fun to visit with and it's obvious that he loves people which makes our visits there so enjoyable.",

I always get nachos and everything is DELICIOUS, I even purchased their Groupon deal. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because their \"birthday song\" for guests is extremely loud and disruptive. They use loud whistles, bells and the whole nine, you can't even hear the people at your table while it's going on. Other than that, great restaurant!",

(We feel like there's a parade in our honor every time we walk through the door!)  The fresh margarita is yummy, and my go-to dish is the Pollo con Crema.  While Don Pedro's might not be the most authentic Mexican fare, it's pretty inexpensive.  You'll eat till you explode and still have plenty left for the takeout box.  And the super friendly staff will point you to some of the more obscure Mexican bakeries, etc. in Charlotte.  And if they recommend them, I'm on it.",

Yummy guacamole made fresh at your table...I ordered a regular margarita and was HUGE...it was literally 3 drinks in one! I could not finish it. (The margarita was $10). My only negative was that they didn't list the prices of the alcoholic beverages. It's ambiance was festive and their booths and bar chairs are made from hand carved wood from Mexico. We did not order dessert (too stuffed!) but the menu had 8 choices and they all looked amazing. The server brought us a cinnamon fried tortilla with whipped cream and raspberry sauce and it was awesome!",

    "text": "The Don Pedros in Pineville is excellent and that's where we used to go every weekend when we lived in Ballantyne!  Unfortunately, this University location is very stingy with the chips and salsa, we could never get any pico de gallo, the chicken in my burritos was dark meat and very tough and lacked any Mexican seasoning, the burritos were spongy and soggy, the Cole slaw was served hot because of the temperature of the plate, the rice had clearly been out for too long because it was hard and overheated so it clumped together, service seems rushed and confused and disappears, there may be 6 Servers that pass your table, but forget service unless your server happens to come back from hiding.  The server also rushed prebusing our table even though we wanted to sit and talk and enjoy our teas.  The server was keen on grabbing our cups!  We had to eat with empty cups for most of the meal.  I kept thinking please don't let me choke! Since this is a chain of locations, you would expect to find consistency from location to location, but for Don Pedros, it's simply not the case.  We will not be returning to the University location.  Also, a small child, a five year old girl I estimate was sat at the bar along with the two ladies that brought her and both ladies were drinking alcoholic beverages but not eating.  I found it very inappropriate and disconcerting that the restaurant allowed this to happen knowing full well the ladies would be driving that child home after drinking enormous cocktails in gigante glasses!",

We have patrons of this restaurant since they were at their previous location, but for some reason they no longer value our business.  They expect us to eat food we didn't order and pay for items we didn't order either.  God forbid you ask them to adjust the bill, the manager comes over and does not help the situation.  Seriously though, I don't think customers should have to pay for the mistakes of the staff.  Overall, the food is good, but not worth the horrible treatment from the staff.",

I was surprised to find out it was a Don Pedro, I frigging love Don Pedro! Why didn't anybody tell me this was here? The atmosphere is great, the interior is very Mexican. They give you THREE salsas, 3 free salsas when you sit down and warm chips.  Then the guacamole cart rolls on by, that stuff is awesome.   The staff here is attentive, friendly and helpful with the menu.  And the menu, ahh.. the menu, it's huge! I've had the tacos and ACP, both great choices.  This is truly one of the best Mexican joints in Charlotte and I'm so happy they opened in the University area!  And anywhere I get to show off my high school Spanish skills is a win in my book.",

The decor is nice and reminds me of the authentic Mexican restaurants from my home town. Usually I'm very disappointed in the \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants I've found in North Carolina. The flavor is usually bland and leaves me craving much better food. This place... We ordered one of their large platters and I was SO happy to find that their food tasted amazing! The shrimp, the chicken, the steak, all so good and cooked perfectly. The service was good but the only thing is they forgot a small dish of received beans, they were happy to bring it to me once I brought it to their attention, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. There was also a cute little boy who would come up to our table and ask us if we wanted any more food, if the service was good, you can tell he wants to serve the family business well :) I recommend this place to everyone! You will definitely enjoy the food and the great customer service!",
