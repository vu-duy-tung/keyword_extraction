The bread itself is amazing already-warm and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. (If you get takeout, the bread won't be as crunchy for obviously reasons. But they're still yummy) Portion sizes are very satisfying too. If you're here with friends i recommend getting a bit bunch of different banh mi's and sharing. GET THE GALBI FRIES. Just get it. Jesus will be proud of you for doing so. The boba in the bubble teas are very satisfactory too--perfectly chewy without feeling mushy. I'm sitting in a sort of happy food coma as I write this now. Absolutely recommend!",

However, I was craving banh mi while during our trip to Great Wolf Lodge and while doing a Yelp search, saw Banh Mi Brothers. They were given great reviews so we went. Walking in, the place was clean and smelled good. The menu had traditional banh mi items and some \"fusion\" style items. My wife ordered the Korean banh mi and a lychee smoothie with boba, my daughter had the grilled chicken, and I had the Pho with an avocado shake. We shared the galbi fries. The food was phenomenal. The meat is juicy, the veggies were crunchy, and the bread was toasty on the outside and soft in the inside. The food was so good I ordered two sandwiches to take home (we live a couple hours away).   Not only the food is great, but most important, the service is excellent. The employees were very polite and our food came out quickly. They even gave us samples of their pork rinds and pork belly, which were amazing.  Overall, this place gets five stars for great food and service. I hope the expand to the Cary/Raleigh area.",

They had stated that it was a great restaurant for banh mis.  Since I was in the University area, I decided to visit and see if it was worth the review.  When you first walk in you see this large black board with all the menu items listed for you to decide on what to order.  From there the staff I friendly and waited as I decided what to order.  To me, the best way to determine if the banh mi is good is to see how they handle the classic cold cut banh mi.  Because if the classic is not up to par, how can the rest of the banh mi be any better.  I ordered the cold cut banh mi, sweet potato fries, and a lychee green tea.  The order did not arrive all at once. The tea came first, then the sweet potato fries, and finally the banh mi. The great thing was that, even though the order did not arrive at the same time, each item came with enough time for me to taste and savor the flavor of each item.  I love lychee and the lychee flavor came on strong in the green tea. The banh mi was good. Lots of vegetables and the cold cuts was tasty. I was disappointed that I could see any liver pate, which is a big part of the banh mi experience.  I heard, from another store owner, the reason why most places don't use the pate is due to the American palate.  Which is a real shame, because it complements/enhances the sweetness of the pickled vegetables.  However, not to be disappointed, I decided to try the special Porchetta banh mi.  I can say that the pork belly was extremely tasty. However, the cracklings was extremely hard. Enough so, that I had to use my fingers to remove the crackling from my mouth.  Between the liver pate and the cracklings, I had to drop a star. But, I would still highly recommend the restaurant to others.",

    "text": "Our new favorite lunch spot. Loved their milk tea! Having recently moved from San Francisco, I went from drinking boba almost everyday to not at all. I tried most of the boba places in Charlotte, and though I was desperate, I didn't find any that I really liked... until I had the milk tea at Banh Mi Brothers that is! The milk tea itself was so good that I didn't want to share with my husband. (Their boba balls were slightly hard.) The owner (I think), who happened to walk by when we were having this conversation, gave my husband one on the house. As if I wasn't sold on their boba alone, their service was just as exceptional!  Their food was just as delicious. My husband devoured their porchetta banh mi, and I enjoyed my summer rolls and fried chicken chunks. Everything about our experience here - from the food to service - was excellent. I only wish it was closer to us.",

They only make a limited number of porchetta sandwiches per day, and I guess I was a little late.  So I ordered the \"pho\".  The menu doesn't specify that its a \"pho sandwich\", but I assumed so and I assumed right.  The meat was not extremely flavorful or abundant for this sandwich that cost almost twice as much as the others.  But the bread and veg were spot on.  I still have faith.  I'll just go for the cheaper banh mi's next time, if the porchetta isn't available.  Me and my buddies also got all kinds of apps too.  Spring rolls were decent, same with the egg rolls, but the real winner here was the fries.  Topped with marinated beef and kimchi it was absolutely perfect.  Probably the best $5 in Charlotte honestly.  I'll be back just for that dish and will probably still get a sandwich as well.",

    "text": "Found this new place on Yelp.  It was amazing.  The restaurant is bright and clean.  When you walk in they have their gorgeous porchetta on display behind a glass case.  My husband was hooked at one glance.  We ordered the chicken Banh Mi and the porchetta Banh Mi sandwiches.  Both were outstanding!  The vegetables were lightly pickled, the jalapenos and cilantro were fresh and the baguette perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside.  The bites with the fresh jalapeno definitely had a kick to them but were counter balanced by the pickled vegetables.  We also tried the fried chicken chunks (marinated chicken thighs that are fried).  Delicious!  But the menu item that caught our attention and brought us in is the Pho-tine.  Their version of poutine (a Canadian dish made with French fries,  cheese curds covered in gravy).  Banh Mi Brothers has brisket and Pho gravy (yes, you read that correctly) and was nothing short of AMAZING.  The location is so much better than Li's down on Sugar Creek and Tryon and in my opinion the food is far superior also.  I think this place is going to do great!  It's an inexpensive fresh delicious meal close to the college.  Once the word gets out about Banh Mi Brothers I suspect they will be packed all the time.    Kudos and we will be back soon!  Those Pho-Tine fries are going to give me cravings and I want to try everything on the menu!",

I got grilled pork, the very friendly cashier said it was her favorite. Crispy, light, fluffy bread, fresh jalapeno and cilantro, chilled pickled veg, and a delicious, almost custard-like, aioli (trust me, it's amazing). A wonderful bahn mi that could compete with any sandwich for the best in Charlotte. Also, get the milk tea.  Unique and satisfying.",

The fries are made in a dedicated fryer so they are vegan as well.  You can get the fries topped with the mushrooms.  They make their own vegan mayo.   These are the best Banh Mi in Charlotte and a great place to go with omnivores.   The Thai tea can be made with soy milk and if you call ahead, they may be able to make the Vietnamese coffee with sweetened condensed soy milk (it is sweet, creamy, strong, and rich.  YUM!).  Fantastic gem of a place with great food and cool place to share a meal.",

As DJ Khaled would say, here's \"another one.\"  We ordered the Pho-Tine Fries, Pho Bahn Mi, Kim-chi Bahn Mi, Summer Spring Rolls, and a Thai Tea. The Pho-Tine Fries were out of this world! If you love the flavor of Pho you will absolutely love this. The gravy is plate licking good. The Summer Spring Rolls were also perfect. 4 large shrimp were in each roll with an awesome Thai dipping sauce. I saved the sauce and used it later with my sandwich because it was so good. My Pho Bahn Mi was fantastic. Great spices and full of flavor. The bread they use has the best crunch and suits the Bahn Mi perfectly. My boyfriend's Kim-chi Bahn Mi was a little on the spicy side, but he loved it. He doesn't typically put may on sandwiches, but commented that the flavor was perfect and he wouldn't change a thing.  The Thai Tea was the only let down for me. We added boba to it and it was just way too sweet. Glad we tried it, but in the future I'd skip this.  The owner was there and was super friendly. We dined in and were really happy with our experience. Fun place to try!",

The people working here were all really nice and our food came out quickly.  I tried both the porchetta banh mi and the classic banh mi. While the porchetta one was good, I think it was a little pricey and I ended up enjoying the classic much more. The ingredients on both sandwiches were very fresh.  And while we are always up for a delicious banh mi, the main thing that brought me to visit Banh Mi Brothers was the pictures of the Galbi French fries. While I wouldn't advise getting the fries plain, because they don't seem like they are fresh cut by any means, definitely get the Galbi fries! The fries were topped with some Korean beef, kimchi, scallion and a cilantro aioli. I don't know why I've never seen this done before, because it was delicious and packed full of flavor!   Overall, I would say it is a little pricey for the banh mi's since we are used to getting them closer to $4 each. However it is worth a visit to try the fries! I am incredibly curious about the pho-tine fries too!",

I'm not a fan of sweet pickled vegetables, which are in the sandwich, but BMB was able to pair it with flavors I do love. The combined flavors were wonderful.    My boyfriend got the grilled chicken Banh Mi. He loved it. He said it was cooked well and had great flavor.   We will definitely come back to this place when we're in the area and need a quick bite to eat.",

But what sets this Bahn Mi shop apart from the rest is their speciality bahn mi's.  Upon entry, they have hip & current music playing. The place is bright and open with a menu on the wall and small menus that you can pick up on the counter.   I wasn't sure what to get but I opted for two of their speciality bahn mi's and boy am I ever so glad that I did. We ordered the Porchetta Bahn Mi (crispy pork belly) and the Korean Bahn Mi and also an order of Crunchy Rolls.   While we waited, I watched them bring out someone's fries and they looked amazing. Kind of kicked myself in the butt for not ordering some but I will definitely be back for those next time.   I watched them make my crispy roll fresh. The girl even remade them because she didn't like how the first ones turned out. Pretty amazing right?  We first tried the Porchetta Bahn Mi and I was like amazed at how good it was right away. The pork belly skin was very crispy, the meat was just juicy and flavorful. And I was surprised at much I really liked the mayo they use. I am not sure what kind of mayo it was but it is definitely more creamy and thick than what we are used to as americans. It really helped the sandwich come together.   As much as I like the Porchetta Bahn Mi, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the Korean Bahn Mi. But the Korean surprised me. It was so good, I mean SOOOOOO GOOD. I opened it and you could see some of the mayo on top so I really wasn't sure but everything on it worked so well the together. The mayo, the kimchi, the marinated beef with the veggies - it all came together and was hands down my favorite.   I promise you I will be back here and be back soon. So glad to see this yummy and delicious spot open in the University area.",

The things we tried are the traditional banh mi, the porchetta banh mi, the galbi fries, the Photine fries, yes Pho tine and the Thai iced tea! The traditional sandwich is generously filled with a great meat to bread to veggie ratio and the bread on all the sandwiches taste fresh and are well made.  The porchetta though a bit more expensive is worth every penny. Each bite is more than delectable. And can we talk about those fries?  OMG!! Who thought of this? The galbi fries are topped with galbi, kimchi, cilantro and a cilantro aioli and they are amazing. And the pho-tine fries, taste like you're eating pho on fries! It works, trust me! The thai iced tea is the best in the area, they actually brew the tea and don't use a powder like other places and the same goes for their smoothies, real fruit! They definitely don't skimp on quality here and that shows in every way.  We met the owner the second visit and he was very nice to get me thai chiles for my banh mi because I love spicy and sometime the jalapenos aren't spicy enough. He also let us sample a milk tea with some glass jelly and it was very good.  I wish I lived closer because I'd definitely be here at least once or twice a week but I don't mind burning up the highway to partake in this yumminess.  I highly recommend this place!

    "text": "Banh Mi Brothers is a unique Vietnamese sandwich shop that has traditional and nontraditional banh mi sandwiches as well as some interesting french fry combinations. I tried the classic banh mi sandwich ($5) and the porchetta banh mi ($7.50). The classic was every bit as traditional as a banh mi. The ham, headcheese, pork, and pate all tasted fine, and the vegetables were all fresh tasting. The bread was decent and had a nice crunch with a soft interior. While the classic banh mi was fine, I didn't care too much for the porchetta banh mi. Vietnamese porchetta is roasted pork with a layer of fat and crispy crackling skin, a traditional Vietnamese pork not typically served on a banh mi. There was a little amount of pork on the sandwich and too much sauce for my taste. It didn't let the pork shine through. I also tried the bulgolgi fries ($5) and those were a meal in themselves. It was shoestring fries with a healthy amount of Korean marinated beef, kimchi, scallions, and cilantro aioli. The Korean flavors were there, and the beef was cooked nicely. I wish there was a little more kimchi and cilantro aioli to add a little more moisture because the fries near the bottom were a little dry, but the fries did maintain their crispiness throughout. Overall, I thought the classic banh mi was decent and the fries were good, but the porchetta banh mi wasn't for me. The prices are a little high for banh mi, but for the area of the store it's still cheaper and a better lunch than you can get from other sandwich shops.",

    "text": "TL;DR:  It scratches the banh mi itch, but does not impress.  Food - 2.5/5 - Certainly could be a preference thing, but the ratios don't seem right.  I've tried both a specialty banh mi (Korean) and a regular char siu (roast prok) banh mi.  For the Korean, I ate it in the restaurant but the thing was practically dripping.  The Kimchi was far too wet and when combined with the other sauces, it ended up getting soggy and unenjoyable extremely quickly.  For the roast pork from the traditional menu, the ratios were better, but it was too heavy on the mayo.  That can certainly be preference, but most other banh mi's the mayo (if there is any) is light and just blends with the flavor.  This one had a distinct mayo taste, which I don't prefer.  My wife had other 'ratio' type issues with hers as well.  Flavor is good, but the execution is inconsistent.  However, the bread was fantastic!  Whoever their baker is does an excellent job with having nice crispy bread with a fluffy inside.  In summary, decent flavor, but poor, inconsistent execution.  We also got a mango smoothie.  It was definitely on the icey side, but had good flavor.    Price - 3/5 - On par with other Banh Mi in the area.  Service - 3/5 - Similar to the food, it was inconsistent.  There was no sriacha on the tables.  They were apparently refilling?  Would recommend not refilling ALL the bottles at the same time.  We asked if the Smoothie came with Boba, which they confirmed it did. When it showed up, no boba :(.  They were very quick at getting us sriracha and adding boba.  So no real issue, but maybe they need to refine their policies and procedures.  Ambiance - 4/5 - Crisp and clean and the chalkboard is fun.",

I like the design of the place and how the menu is written in chalk, it definitely adds a creative feel to the place.   But what really got me is the fact they do a spin on your average Vietnamese banh mi. They have a specialty banh mi with Korean flavors. It has bulgogi and kimchi, along with cilantro, cucumber, and an aioli sauce that just melts with the bulgogi. It was HEAVENLY. I got the banh mi to-go, and you can tell they make it fresh because the bread was crispy and delicious.   Also the staff were really friendly. I was greeted with smiles and as I was leaving they smiled and said \"hope you have a nice day!\" Everything about the place seemed to give me good vibes and I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I've grown up on asian sandwiches my whole life. Being Asian myself along with having friends and neighbors of many ethnicities has enabled me to taste the flavorful sandwich in many forms. From a tomato sardine nom pang of Cambodia, the lemongrass pork banh mi of Vietnam or the cold cut Laotian khao jee, they're all delicious. What I haven't tried is the mix of East and West which I finally did here with the porchetta banh mi. The porchetta is a large slab of skin on pork belly that's been marinated in herbs and spices, rolled into a log and roasted. Traditionally an Italian dish. The brothers here roast fresh pork belly every day for the Vietnamese sandwich. One bite and I was in love. The pork chunks were moist and full of flavor. The best part? They roast the meat until the skin becomes crackly and crunchy pork rinds and throw in a couple rinds into the sandwich. Each bite was savory from the pork, tangy from the pickled carrots and daikon, crunchy from the pork rinds, spicy from the jalapenos and to top it all off, the fresh cilantro. Flavor heaven! My son ordered the BBQ pork banh mi and I'm pretty sure he swallowed it whole in record time. He said it was the best banh mi he's ever had - that's saying a lot coming from my picky teenager. We also ordered Tom yum pork rinds. Why? Cause you can never have enough pork for lunch! The pork rinds were covered in a mouth watering sour and spicy salty Tom yum mix, exactly the right flavors that you'd find in the traditional Thai Tom yum soup. The owners are also lovely. They greet you when you walk in and thank you when you leave. Come try this place out. Not only are you getting great food at a reasonable price - you're also supporting a small local business who's appreciative of your patronage.",

Try one of the fresh fruit shakes. My favorite is the lychee but try the jackfruit or avocado for something different. The glass jelly drink is also something hard to find. It's basically the Vietnamese version of jello in a drink. They're all refreshing on a hot day!  Service was excellent and they aim to please.

My son said it was really good tho. I also had the Thai tea with bobba which was really good.   Inside: the window was really foggy, maybe someone don't know how to clean glass correctly. The floors looked (see photo) dirty, but as I was looking at the other photos, I just think that's how they are. Maybe they need new floors, it's really noticeable and make the place looks dirty when it's not. They have a good amount of tables   Employees: I did not get a friendly welcome, the question should have been \"Hello, have you ever been here before?\" If the customer says no then maybe they should say, \"Well let me tell you some of our most popular things on the menu\". Because you can tell when it's someone first time there,  they will have a clueless look (and I did).",

To me the cilantro aioli was just mayo and the flavors didn't work well since it dry and flavorless somehow. Eitheway the portions are very filling, so I would recommend sharing them with friends!  The banh mi's dare very filling and flavorful so I would recommend getting those! I'm top choice would be the BBQ pork.",

It was a good experience and would go back when we were in the area.    I had the Porchetta and my wife had the traditional Grilled pork Bahn Mi.  We also ended up sharing an order of the Galbi fries.  Both sandwiches were good and had a lot of flavor.  I enjoyed the jalapeno in the Porchetta and got a nice jolt in the process.  I do question the 2.50 increase for the Porchetta (but at the end of the day, I did enjoy it).  The Galbi fries were a nice change of pace and really enjoyed the different flavors.  That could be someones meal.    Service was good.  You order from the counter and they bring it to the table.  They did check on us a few times during our meal which was a nice touch.    This is a good place to visit for a quick lunch.",

Not only was the food delicious but everyone is so nice and happy that you can't help but leave in a good, positive mood!  The sandwiches we debated on getting were the porchetta, grilled pork, and the pho banh mis. We ended up getting the porchetta and pho. Both were delicious with the porchetta being my favorite and the pho being my fiance's favorite. They also gave us samples of the grilled pork fresh off the grill and it was really tasty. We ended up getting a Korean banh mi to go and I have a feeling I won't be disappointed.  Not only do they make banh mis, but they also have a lot of appetizers, sides, and drink options. I'll definitely be back several times to try the rest of the menu!",

The first thing that struck me was what a cool place it is with a modern and clean feel.  Next was the \"open\" kitchen arrangement.  I always appreciate a place that does this because the entire team is \"on display\" for you to see.  Now, let's talk food.  The group I was with basically ended up trying almost every dish on the menu.  We were also lucky enough that one of the owners, Hau, happened to be there and he greeted us and explained some of the dishes his creativity that went into making them.   Here's what we had: Pork rinds, Summer rolls, crunchy rolls, Pho-Tine, Korean Fries, the Porchetta, Pho and Korean Bahn Mi's, Chinese BBQ, Cured Pork and Classic Banh Mi's.  A few had hangover tea, Thai Coffee and Vietnamese coffee.    My overall review is 5+ stars as the food was absolutely MAJESTIC for me.  Every bite of every item was completely satisfying and you could taste the unique and creative way that they have made it.  I highly recommend it and it's on my \"must goto\" list for food in Charlotte.",

I decided to come because it had a high rating here on Yelp.   Since I'm new to this style of food I don't have anything to compare it to, but here were my thoughts during my experience:   The inside is small but tastefully decorated. The chalk wall was great! The lady at the counter was extremely nice. I asked for a recommendation and she said the most popular sandwich was the Porchetta - Heo Quay, so I got that. It had pork belly as the meat with carrots, cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno, pickled veggies (not a strong pickle flavor which I liked), and a caramelized sauce. Over all the flavor was tasty and refreshing. The sauce was extremely sweet. By the end of it my stomach started to hurt, but I have an extremely sensitive stomach so don't let that deter you if you have no diet restrictions! I also got the seasoned fries and they fried them up right when I ordered them so it tasted fresh!   Overall, good experience and I definitely want to go back and try some other items!",

They have pork belly that was recommended by the young lady taking orders and she let me sample it and it was very tasty and tender, but I finally decided on the fresh summer rolls and the pho-tine fries.  The fries were covered with brisket, cilantro and scallions.......yummy!  It came with gravy on the side but I didn't use any of it as it was already perfect without it.  The summer rolls were really fresh and come with an almond butter sauce that was really good.  This spot has really good food and with really great prices, I see why they're such a favorite.",

The sub was soooo delicious and the chicken chunks were better than Chik Fil a! I will be back today :)",

All were absolutely incredible (and I've been out East and eaten authentic Pho, Bahn-mi, etc), and the Galbi fries were gone in 2 min flat. The kimchi is homemade, and you can definitely taste the difference. The aioli and pickled vegetables are the perfect complement on the sandwiches, and balance the other rich flavors out. We also ordered the Lychee and Mango fruity green teas, and they were amongst the best bubbles teas I've tasted too!  While we were eating, the owner came over and introduced himself, and you can tell he has a tremendous amount of passion for what he does; it shows in every aspect of this restaurant. The staff is friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere is bright and laid back, and the food is a delicious and incredible value! I don't normally go on and on like this, but this place deserves it. Will definitely be back!!",

In my head, I wanted another one but I didn't say anything. My boyfriend asks \"would you like another one?\" I really wanted to but I passed on it because then I knew we'd be getting more than just another one haha. I didn't want to share. So the best drink award goes to green paradise ! It's a must have. Thank you for reading my long and very first yelp review ever. I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!!! Oh yeah and I forgot, the manager or owner or i don't even know came and checked up on us as well. He was very nice and explained that the green paradise was a good but also healthy drink. It is it is. I shall be back for it. Thank you banh mi brothers !",

The standard grilled pork was my order today, it was extremely tasty.

I rarely go to the university area ever since I jumped ship from my old job that was located off of Mallard Creek Church, but the area has definitely changed with the light rail opening up.  The store can be a little hard to find if you aren't looking for it, since it's tucked away in a large 2 story complex on the corner of Tryon and WT Harris.  Once you find it and walk in, you walk into a wall of smells (good) and the daunting menu on the right hand side.  The tables are clean and modern with white tile decor... interesting artwork about Banh Mi sandwich construction adorn the walls.  Staff was friendly.  I asked about what they recommended from the menu.  I ended up deciding on the shredded pork, pho-tine fries, and a Vietnamese iced coffee.  It was delicious.  I recommend sharing the fries though... or not, depends on the crowd you are with.",

My poor baby...let me get my jalapenos tho...k thanks.  The food:  We ordered 2 Korean Banh Mi's, however, I just wanted a basic beef Banh Mi with all the fillings. So, we got it without the kimchee and jicama. The marinated beef had no real depth of flavor. It was sort of sweet, but bland as if it was boiled in sugar water. The pickled carrots and daikon were also sweet, not vinegary at all, and vinegar is what it needed. There wasn't enough cilantro for my liking and I did not taste the aioli at all. I had to add soy sauce to enhance the flavor. Overall, the balance of the sweet, salty and sour was missing.   Shrimp summer rolls-Meh. They could have used some cilantro and Thai basil to awaken the taste buds a bit. Also the lettuce had a lot of stalks attached.  Green paradise drink-was yummy and fresh. It was kind of thick like a meal in and of itself, so I drank it as a snack later.  In conclusion, the Banh mi bread and the green paradise were bomb. I wasn't blown away by anything. I may give it another try, but a sistah doesn't eat pork and that is primarily what they have on their sammich menu sooooooooooo. That is all.",

    "text": "I was at the oasis shriner for a vietnamese association held new year festival, i did not have cash with me and the vendors on site only accepted cash. I began looking at places nearby to eat, of course vietnamese places, because I was trying to have what I could not at the venue!  There are a number of asian restaurants in the same shopping center. I walked in to banh mi bros and was greeted by a scent of grilling. Then i saw the delicious looking pork bellies.   $8ish for the fancy banh mi's here. I am against paying a lot for banh mi's because i think the best ones are fresh, crispy and cheap! Unlike sushi, banh mi's should not be expensive. I decided against getting the porchetta which is the only banh mi that had pork belly in it. I tried the cured pork and bbq pork, the cured pork is very tender and definitely above and beyond other banh mi places in charlotte for the execution. The bbq pork was less special. The milk tea was good, not great, slightly cheaper than the tea place nearby. The banh mi's are long and skinny, so they were a good size.  Bathrooms here are clean and they made good use of the space in the restaurant to make sure there is ample seating.  What i did not like is seeing a worker texting while scrubbing and open fire grill, huge safety and sanitation hazard. Also it took literally 25 min for my order to come out!!! Most people do not have that kind of time or patience for a to go order. I came at 3:30 in the afternoon so there weren't even a lot of people there. Banh mi's do not take long to make.",

    "text": "I'm a bit of a banh mi connoisseur having tried many versions, but the True sign that lets you know you're going to sink your teeth into a delicious banh mi is that Vietnamese butta'.   This place is on point.  They're doing it right. They know that butter makes it better (it's actually mayo, but just play along)! Unless it's spreading out the sides a little bit or maybe even mixing with the juices of the vegetables and meats and dripping deliciousness  when you tilt for the bite, you will not get the optimal experience.  Good toast on the bread that doesn't crumble and the vegetables were crisp and fresh.  Up to this point, you might be assuming I had a meat filled sandwich, but I am giving these accolades based on ordering a vegetarian banh mi....and I'm not even vegetarian.  I've been all over the country and have never seen any authentic vegetarian option aside from tofu, so I had to try their version and it was great.  Rivals the best of the best meat counterparts I've had elsewhere.  Haven't had one here yet to make an in house comparison but if the foundation is good and the skin on the porchetta on that cutting board looks crisp, one can imagine.  It's obvious they're out here sharing a vision of their dream.  Come out and experience a piece of it.",

We were greeted with friendly staff who provided excellent customer service by giving us recommendations on what to get. The food came out fast and fresh. The fries had a generous portion and all of the toppings made it very well balanced. The porchetta banh mi is the most expensive thing on the menu and I can \"taste\" why - the pork belly was full of flavor and crisp! The owner makes a limited amount of crispy pork to retain its full crispy texture so you know you are getting quality when you order this banh mi. What we really appreciate the most about our experience is being greeted by the owner himself. He took the time out to ask us how the food and service was and was very genuine to his customers. We will definitely be back!!",

The baguette was crispy on the outside and the meat was sliced on the spot. I'd come back and try everything else!

If you've had Crispy Banh Mi, the main differences here are a) the menu variety and creativity, and b) BMB uses a mayo-based sauce in their sandwiches to give a creamier texture. Oh, and the bread is softer here as well.   I think it's all a matter of preference with those points honestly, because my sandwich here was delicious. I loved that they had inventive menu items as well, introducing korean influences and doing fun things like \"Pho\"-tine instead of poutine (yea, they have fries here!).

How can you go wrong with pork belly and other pork topped with shredded daikon and carrot and something green and saucy sauce on baguette? a little something different going on with each bite, yea flavours and textures! MLB's bowl was much larger than expected: vermicelli topped with all the vegetative goodness and braised porks with fish sauce on the side... enough came home for lunch tomorrow. chickens were chunked and fried to exquisition: hot, crispy, crunchy, moisty and I could go for a bed of calrose rice under that but that's just me. and BTW: what's with the no-parking deck?",

    "text": "Loved this place so much we went twice in one day!   First time my husband and I shared a Porchetta Banh Mi. It was really yummy! Loved the crispy crust of the porchetta and the abundance of the pickled veggies the delicious sauce and crusty bread had the perfect texture of a really good Banh Mi.   The restaurant was clean and bright and service was super friendly. I wish we had a Banh Mi Brothers closer so I could go more often.   The second visit we shared a more traditional Banh Mi and the Pho fries. The Banh Mi was delicious but I think the Porchetta edged it out just by a bit for me. Don't get me wrong, I don't think they could serve anything I wouldn't love here. When we got our fries, the meat was still cold so we asked for a new order. They happily brought us out another piping hot order with no problem. Yum! I could taste  all the delicious flavors of Pho!   Next time, yes there will definitely be a next time, I will try the Korean Banh Mi and some more fries in a different flavor too!",

Need to think that through more as it relates to the last meal on my Yelp profile which currently doesn't say \"sandwich\".   All that aside, I'm relatively new to Banh Mi's.  Not in knowing they exist mind you, just in actually eating one.  I was in the Tryon/Harris Blvd area around lunchtime one day and stopped by to sample the fare at Banh Mi Brother's and was very happy with the decision.   Got a cured pork version of the sandwich and an order of crispy egg rolls to go.  The egg rolls were indeed crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce, but the sandwich....  Whoa!  From the first bite I was taken to bliss-ville.  Yummy fillings with fresh pickled veg and jalapeno for heat and the cured pork, which was kind of loaf-like in texture had such nice flavor.  And finally, the bread.  Just perfect combo of light crispy exterior, soft and chewy interior.  Whatever sandwich filling you stuck in this bread would be elevated.    I look forward to many return visits and see many more Banh Mi's in my future.",

It's fast casual so you order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table.   We got the Korean Banh Mi, the Porchetta Banh Mi, and the Pho-tine fries. All of it was amazing. I lean slightly toward the Korean Banh Mi flavor, but both were great. I didn't really like the crispy pieces in the Porchetta because I thought I was going to chip a tooth, but I just picked it out.   The owner was super friendly and brought us out free pork rinds which were probably the best I've had. The seasoning was incredibly and they were so soft. The service was also very fast.   For drinks, we started with a Thai Tea and then everything was so good I went back and got a Mango Fruit Shake and a Passion Fruit Fruity Tea. The shake and Thai Tea were my favorites, but the fruity tea was also very good. We obviously added bobba to all of them.   I highly recommend coming out of your way to come here! I'll definitely be back for more of the menu!",

It was definitely a much different experience at a place that is known for and specializes in their banh mi. Each one that I got to try all tasted extremely fresh and that was probably my favorite thing about eating here.   The Pho-tine and Korean fries both had great presentation and tasted incredible. It's hard for me to choose which ones I liked more.   The vibe of the place is really great and they've got a variety of music options playing to keep it pretty lively. If you like Korean food and are looking for a new place to try or are new to eating Korean and want a good place to start, I recommend checking out Banh Mi Brothers.",

Situated in a nice little complex with ample parking upfront.   I love that this place opens at 1030 already, not only can you beat the lunch rush, but also convenient if you want to grab something on the go for lunch meetings - which I have so many and don't want breakfast food.  Food:  My favorites sandwiches are - Chinese BBQ Pork - Grilled Chicken - The Porchetta (Roasted pork belly)  the baguettes they come on are crispy but soft, perfectly fresh. The veggie pairings on the sandwich perfectly complements the protein. They have vegetarian options too, perhaps I'll try them next time. I just can't seem to steer away from my faves though.   One sandwich perfectly fills you for lunch, without being too heavy, but for dinner I usually get a side.  My recommendations are: - PhoTine (Brisket and pho sauce, how can you not) - Season Fries (gives you a little kick, I usually squirt sirracha on top)  Drinks: - Thai Ice tea with boba (tapioca bubbles). Silky sweet delicious tea.  Will I come back? Actually say Hi when you see me :)",

    "text": "This is the most overdue update ever, so let's do it!  Banh Mi Brothers: I love you.  There I said it, and I can never take it back. If I find myself on the other side of town and have an itch for something familiar yet creative? I'm driving to Banh Mi Bros. I have a friend with me around lunchtime who knows nothing about Vietnamese Cuisine? We're going to Banh Mi Bros. If I finally snap and end up on death row? My last meal would probably be from Banh Mi Bros (although I hope it never comes to that)!  I think the thing I like the most about this place is the fact that they take a cuisine that many in Charlotte aren't familiar with, and make it extremely inviting and easy to understand. Take the first sandwich on the menu for example: Porchetta. Most would know this as a predominately Italian entree that is extremely rich and flavorful. It's usually served on it's own, but pair it with cilantro, pickled carrot/radish, jalapenos, and top with finely chopped pork cracklings all in a crisp toasted bun. You have yourself a delicious piece of perfection in a sandwich.  Lately I've been on a binge for the Korean Banh Mi variant. The Kimchi is crisp and mild. Instead of decadent Pork belly you get Marinated Beef that full of bright soy and garlic flavor. Some days I'll get the Pho Banh Mi which is topped with a Pho gravy... a PHO GRAVY, y'all! No gimmick, it's all legit.  I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that where other places bank tradition or the \"right\" way to do things, Banh Mi Brothers has diversified... and they did it well. I've been there twice already this week and I'd be game for that damn Porchetta right now!  They're doing all kinds of new stuff all the time. They did Vietnamese Rice Soup bowls this past weekend and also have noodle bowls, summer rolls, teas, and fruit shakes. The Coffee is bold and strong, sweetened with condensed milk, it'll kick you into high gear for sure.  Hau: You, your team, and your amazing restaurant is truly a gift to the University neighborhood. Sure, I get excited for new restaurants, and old favorites, but Banh Mi Bros is one of the few places I get genuinely ecstatic for no matter what!",

I opted to not get a Banh Mi and instead indulged in the galbi fries and fried chicken bites. The chicken was super crispy and seasoned well. I used the pho sauce to dip them in and it was a party in my mouth!  The fries were amazing although I would have liked a bit more of the sauce on them. The galbi meat was tender and had a nice sweet/savory flavor. I am glad I ordered this for myself because they were too good to share! The fries also came with a cup of delicious kimchi that I quickly devoured. I think this place is worth a repeat visit to check out some more of their other fusion offerings.",

I typically get the banh mi but I just had it for lunch so I got the vermicelli Bowl and it was delicious. Its simple everything that is in a banh  Mi without the bread and you get a an eggroll. The green Paradise  is a solid healthy drink option blended vegetable smoothie.  Also tried there fried banana  dessert which was delicious. Didnt take the picture because I ate it too fast. It was like a thin eggroll with banana inside drizzled with honey? Nice and hot and the eggroll was super thin and crispy mmmmmmm.",

The staff was so friendly and let me even try a sample of there jack fruit- which was soo good. I ordered the Jack fruit shake, the sweet potato fries, & the Chinese Banh Mi. My husband had his Banh Mi Wrapped like a spring roll bc of his gluten intolerance for no extra charge. He got regular fries with his and I will have to admit they were better then the sweet potato fries. The portions here are huge, so we totally could of spilt the fries. This seriously is one of the best sandwich shops I have been to, and I can't wait to go back!!",

We also shared an order of galbi fries, basically a version of gravy fries covered with meat and veggies which were awesome. The sandwiches were served on fresh crusty rolls and loaded with veggies. We got the classic, the pho and the Korean. All great, the Korean served with Kim chi. Service was great, the owner obviously puts heart and soul into this place. Everyone was very kind and helpful with describing menu items. Even let us taste the head cheese they make right there in shop. It was really delicious. Keep up the great work!

We took the rest home and warmed them up in the oven and they were still good after being in the frig for a few days.  The grilled chicken, classic bahn mi, and bbq pork were all good.  Nice clean flavors, not too porky/swiney but I do think they need to add a little more meat to their sandwiches.  The best part was the amazing customer service.  The vietnamese iced coffee had a slightly different flavor, not the typical Cafe Du Monde notes.  We would definitely go back to try all the other menu items.",

Crowd that comes in is a mix of business folks and college kids from UNCC.

The carrots had a subtle pickling that made them an excellent complement to the slightly sweet flavor of the seasoning on the pork. The jalapenos provided a subtle heat--not the overpowering pepper flavor that I usually think of with a jalapeno. They accommodated my cilantro hate easily & also didn't bat an eyelash when my anti-mayo husband piped up with his special request. The manager came around to check on everyone in the restaurant & stopped by a table for a chat. He obviously knows his customers and clientele. I am usually a low carb eater & I noticed that they accommodate for low carb, vegan, and vegetarian diners as well. The prices were amazing. I guess this gives us another reason to make the trek to Ikea & the university side of town. We'd definitely make the extra trip!",

So - when I saw the 4.5 rating for Banh Mi Brothers, I was skeptical. But being a Banh Mi lover, I decided to drive out of my way on a recent trip to Charlotte, and OMFG. This place is really a complete treasure. Very thoughtful food extremely well prepared. Insane attention to detail and while that's all nice and good, it's the outcome. Spent a little time with the owner and such a nice guy and great operation. I ordered 4 different Banh Mi and a bowl to go and ended up eating one there so I could hang out. The only advice I'd give them is to raise their prices, way too good of a value. If this place doesn't keep getting better it won't be because of the food or the owners. This is only - like - my 3rd 5 star rating and I'm proud to give it. Realistically it's as much for the whole of the operation as it is the food, but all totaled, just amazing!",

The kimchi with the savory Korean marinated beef is the perfect combination. I just wish the sandwiches were a little bigger. The porchetta sandwich comes in a close second. The crackle is extremely crunchy...imagine the crunch of brittle, but harder. Yes! But the flavor of the sandwich is very good. The fresh cilantro on top of their sandwiches...hmmmmm, it really makes a difference. The cilantro just takes it to another level of YUMMY! The chicken sandwich is very good as well, the jalapeno peppers give it just enough kick to have you reaching for your Thai tea. And speaking of the Thai tea...it's sinfully delicious. I try to savor mine, but it's very difficult not to inhale it. Everyone who we've interacted with here have been extremely nice and helpful in helping us make our food selections. Next time, we are trying the fries. This place has officially been put in our Yelp \"FAVORITES\" category.",

The girl at the counter was friendly and helpful answering questions on the menu and made some recommendations, which we took. We tried the grilled pork and the Porchetta. Both were pretty delicious and on par with our favorite Banh mi place closer to where we live. It was slow when we went, but not surprising for the 2pm stop. She gave us complimentary pork rinds to try since she knew it was our first time. I don't know what was on them but the spice was a good blend, a little spice and a hint of something sweet. Would definitely have again.",

My beau and I stopped by while passing through Charlotte and was pleasantly surprised that not only did they serve delicious sandwiches, they have a pretty wide menu that can satiate all of your Vietnamese cravings! We both ordered the porchetta banh mi with roasted pork belly- I could resist, they cut the meat in front of you! We also ordered from fresh spring rolls and the fried chicken as an appetizer. So... the porchetta actually wasn't as good as I thought it would be- I think it's because we went at an awkward time at 3 pm when there's some leftovers from the lunch rush but the preparations for the dinner rush hasn't commenced either. As such, the cut on the pork belly was far more fat than meat. Still the potential is there! I really liked that they load your sandwich with lots of vegetables and lots of jicama, making it taste extremely fresh. The fried chicken was delectable- extremely crispy and well seasoned. The spring rolls on the other hand were.... not great. There just wasn't vegetables and way too much noodles in it so there just wasn't a crunch.",

I'm a bit confused why the vegetarian bahn mi costs more than the other choices with meat. $6 for some bread, mayo, and pickled vegetables? That's a far stretch. My second let down is that when I went to open my \"vegetarian\" sandwich, there was a full layer of what appeared to be cooked pork. Was there a mix-up at the register? Perhaps, but it wasn't a busy time in the restaurant so I would have hoped for a little more carefulness. Luckily, I'm not a strict (or religious) vegetarian, or this would have been inedible.   I'm sure, like at any restaurant, there are on and off days. I'm bummed to have had my only experience on an off day, but I'm also reluctant to give it another chance.",

Right off the bat, we noticed the menu was the perfect size - you have options, but it's not overwhelming and the prices are perfect. There was five of us, so we grabbed a few different banh mi between the lot of us, as well as the pho-tine, Korean fries, seasoned fries, Thai tea with boba, and milk tea with boba. I think we got more than we bargained for!  The banh mi were delicious, on all accounts. I think the porchetta was a group fave. The fries were also a hit!  The pho-tine and Korean fries were one of my favorite parts of the meal just because they were so unique and delicious (and there was enough to feed a small army - we couldn't finish them all). The seasoned fries are perfect for any pickier eaters. A cold milk tea with boba was a satisfying way to wrap up the meal!  I don't get to eat out often, but I'm definitely happy I went out for lunch today. This place gets it right on taste, price, and atmosphere. The kind and helpful staff was a bonus!

The beef was cooked to perfection and there was an ample amount. I was also pleasantly surprised that the sandwich was only $6.50 considering it's generous size.   I enjoyed listening to the early 2000s pop/hip-hop music that was playing in the restaurant and appreciated that there was sriracha on each table (I add it to everything).

The flavors, incredible. They don't skimp on the toppings of the sandwich, and I KNOW that meat was juicy because I saw them cutting it up. I also got Bubble Tea and it was creamy and delicious.   The decor is clean, simple, and unassuming. They have chalkboard menus with the \"anatomy\" of banh mi which I loved.   The service was great. Not only was the cashier friendly, but she also checked to make sure I liked the bubble tea once she served it to me. They were quick to bring out the food, which I appreciated for a lunch break.   The menu itself was descriptive, and there were plenty of options but not overwhelming. They sure know how to specialize. I'm looking forward to coming back with my husband, tasting some of those incredible-looking fries, and more bubble tea. So excited to see even more diverse food offerings in the area. I was in heaven eating this meal!",

    "text": "I really like this place. I am big on service, so I was happy about the big smile I received when it was my turn. I got there about an hour before close, too, so if you can keep smiling that sincerely all day, good on you.  I decided on the Chinese BBQ pork because why get that one delicious thing that everyone else is raving about? I loved my sandwich. The meat was fresh and nicely seasoned. The veggies were crisp. The bread was nice and crunchy outside, soft inside, and just big enough to balance the fillings without being too much.  I also got the Pho-tine fries. They were good, but not good to me. Does that make sense? They were hot, fresh, well made, and well seasoned, but there is some flavor in particular Asian cuisines that I cannot identify that I do not like at all. It was in the gravy, but please, by all means give them a try. If you don't mind whatever that flavor is, you will love those fries.   Large portions, reasonable prices, friendly service. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here during the grand opening so there was a pretty long line but that was to be expected.   The place was clean and the decor was kept simple and minimal. The menu was written on a chalkboard and there's not too much on the menu to get overwhelming but enough to have options which i really like.   My friend and I got the BBQ pork Banh Mi and it was pretty good. It was flavorful but nothing special. The milk tea was ok. A tad bit bland. And the last thing we got were the seasoned fries. I didn't really like this. There wasn't much seasoning on it and a bit too crispy for my taste. It definitely look and smell better than it taste.   I'll probably come back and give this place another try. I do think they have good potential to be really good.",

    "text": "Take this review with a grain of salt, I need to visit twice more to really solidify my opinion.  There is a lot of bread in this sandwich.  There is also a great deal of variance, sometimes you have a two star time, and others a four star time.  I prefer consistency but consistently bad isn't preferable to occasionally good.  The service is excellent, but in this segment I am more price sensitive than service sensitive.  Any mistakes can be quickly fixed so the service is a plus but the experience isn't impacted as heavily as a serious sit down place would be.  There aren't a lot of other choices in this segment, although I am looking. I like that they are making some bold choices in the menu, but for me those choices didn't pan out very well.",

The bun was nice and crispy so it didn't get soggy either. The flavor was more than you expected for a banhmi and I loved it! We also had the galbi fries which had kimchi on top. Again the best! I've tried a lot of different types of kimchi fires but these beat everyone else's IN CHARLOTTE. I definitely recommend this place to anyone. It's inexpensive and the food is worth the drive.",
