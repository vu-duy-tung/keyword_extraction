The service was quick and they had a good variety of pizza slices to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  The pizza crust is thin and New York style, but the outer edge of the crust had a little extra thickness to it that I liked.  One of the best things about Fuel Pizza at that hour is the crowd of people that accumulates.  The huge open space of Fuel is good for socializing, or just sitting back to watch other people socialize.  There tends to be quite a random mix of people late into the night.  Fuel would probably not be my #1 choice for pizza in Charlotte, but it makes for the perfect ending to a night out uptown.",

    "text": "Let me paint the scene for you: It's about 2:30 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. My friends and I have been at the Lady Gaga show for the past 4 hours, before that we were in a hotel room imbibing in a few adult  beverages. Now it's late, we're starving and there is no McDonalds in sight (by the way, what's up with that?!) So we beg our cab drive, 'PLEASE SIR, Take us to somewhere that's delicious!' And Fuel Pizza is what we found, or rather what we were taken to.   There was good and bad to this trip (bear with me, my mind is a little foggy on the exact details). We arrive, step out of our cab and see that the line is out of the door and down the street a few people. Yikes. But we're hungry, and we're a little tipsy* so of course we decide to wait. We chat, time goes by, but it is a LONG wait. On the plus side, I think it's awesome that there is a pizza place that stays open past 2am - that's a very rare find where I'm from in the Hampton Roads area.   Anyway, we finally get to order: a few slices and a few garlic knots. The prices are good, I think I paid 6 bucks for a drink, a garlic knot, and two slices of cheese. The pizza is alright - it's thin crust and greasy, but let's be real - that's the best kind of pizza when you've been out and about all night being tipsy*. So it was a fun experience, just me, my friends, and every other drunk in Charlotte waiting for a slice of pie.  *We took cabs ALL night long. If you're gonna be tipsy, be responsible.",

    "text": "Where do I start? The terrible service or the endless amount of disrespect? It bothers me that I can't just write this rating without giving ANY stars. The first time I came here was after a night on the town with friends...decent experience. I had asked for a cup to get some water but they handed my friends and I a few bottles of water instead, for free! That really made my friends and I realize we would definitely be returning! The buffalo chicken sub was yummy but cold. Anyway, the second time I came here was with my boyfriend. We were out with some friends but ended the night early because we were too tired and I had work the next day, so we decided to come here before the bars closed and to beat the crowd. We arrived around 11:00pm and there were only a few people in the restaurant at that time. The same guy had waited on us as the last time...we went on with our order and I proceeded to ask for a cup to get some water. He then says \"we do not give out cups for water, bottled water is $2.00\". I then began to explain the last time we were here that they were given to us for free and that he should have remembered, well, because he was the one to do it! So I asked to speak with a manager because it seemed as if he just didn't want to hear it...little did I know HE WAS THE MANAGER! Hahahaha LOL!!! What a joke...so much for great customer service right? He then proceeds to get his joke of a bouncer to come over and escort us out...for what reason? I couldn't tell ya! The entire situation was a joke and we were waiting for Ashton Kutcher to pop out with the cameras \"You just got Punk'd!\" However, that didn't happen, so my boyfriend and I took our business elsewhere. That's when we ended up at the Pita Pit. I never was a huge fan of Pita Pit but it was the only thing that was around and open at the time to serve food. The place was empty so we ordered pretty quickly and as we were waiting for our food, guess who shows up?! The bouncer from Fuel Pizza! He was talking to the other joke of a bouncer at Pita Pit, pretending to act like we weren't the reason he was at that place. Hmmm...what a coincidence! Lol so basically we were being watched and stalked the entire time we are waiting patiently for our food minding our business. I just don't understand...all my boyfriend and I wanted to do was grab a simple bite to eat before heading home for the night and it turned out to be a terrible experience with endless amounts of disrespect and humiliation. I have never experienced anything like this before and it is sickening to me that a business, like this Fuel Pizza location, stays open to the public. Instead of the \"bouncer\" paying attention to the REAL problems, they go after the innocent people, like my boyfriend and I, that were never looking to be involved or cause any kind of trouble. I think I'll just let karma take care of the rest for this terrible business.",

The delivery came on time - as you know, when you are that hungry every minute counts - and he was very nice.   The whole way back up the elevator I was enveloped by the scent of melted cheese and greesy cardboard. I couldn't help it so I peeked in the box - it looked GOOOOOOOD. We got it home and began devouring it immediately - half regular, half chicken parm, which I regretted after I ordered it because I knew it wouldn't be the NY style chicken parm that we were craving. We were right, but it still wasn't THAT bad.   Our hunt continues for The Great Pizza, but Fuel did the job pretty well.",

I remembered Fuel around the corner, and since Town Tavern didn't serve food, it would be a-ok to get my nosh on.  During a lull in the game, I sprinted around the corner and breathlessly ordered buffalo wings with spicy sauce. When they were done, I threw cash at the cashier and sprinted back to the bar.  I opened the box and noticed golden brown wings. Interesting. Is the spicy sauce disguised? Nope, they just forgot to put it on the chicken.  I made R run back and have them correct it. They were all good sports about it. With the sauce, the wings weren't bad at all; a good size and meaty. And the service was ace-cakes, all very nice. And there was a massive screen with the match showing, so I didn't even miss a beat of the game.   I can't remember if I've had Fuel's pizza, but the wings weren't too shabby.",

I like that they have different toppings from the standard  such as spinach/ricotta, bbq chicken etc compared to pepperoni, mushroom, etc. I hear that their full pizzas are a lot better than their slices and looks like they have a good variety of those as well. My slice of BBQ Chicken was flavorful but not memorable. All in all, good pizza in a pinch but it won't be winning my heart as \"Best Pizza in Charlotte\" anytime soon.",

The newer location in the Hearst Building and on South Blvd try to reach the heights the old one had, but they fall just a bit short in my opinion. For a long time this was my favorite pizza place in Charlotte (along with Wolfman), because they had that True NY style of thin slices with heaps of greasy meat piled on top. I will second the opinion given below that the single slices heated up are definitely not the way to go, if you are going to come here you have to get a fresh pie for the True experience.  The non-pizza items are also pretty good, especially the wings. If you like hot stuff as much as I do try them Inferno style, just have plenty of water or beer to cool your mouth down! The garlic knots are also dangerously addictive, and if you're not careful you can easily fill up quickly before your pizza is even ready. Overall I still think Fuel is the place to go if you want some REAL pizza, and I don't think Charlotte has anything to knock it off the throne just yet.",

Not only was the staff unable to correctly do their job, but they were rude to the customers and to each other. A supervisor ran around the restaurant screaming at customers about last call acting as if his paying customers were nuisances. His staff behind the counter talked about him and the customers while cursing as if no one could hear. After a staff member screwed up my order, she screamed at me that I was to blame and she was too busy to help and it wasn't her problem. Her supervisor did not help the situation.   Needless to say, I am happy that I do not frequent Charlotte enough to be tempted by their great pizza as I refuse to give them another one of my hard earned dollars due to their awful service.

Its a good place to eat if you're in a hurry and looking for something cheap. The decor is strange garage/body shop look and it is not a trendy place to be in. But then for their price range they arent expected to be trendy.  I did find one thing weird - they had pizza dough sitting in a platter by the door when you enter.

First of all, it's fast: you get your food quickly and efficiently, and it never tastes like it was just microwaved or heated up. It's always pretty fresh, which is key. The also have beer offerings, and that compliments the food really well. A lot of pizza joints don't, sadly, and that just won't cut it with me.   I got two slices: buffalo chicken and spinach-tomato-ricotta, and both were pretty great. The buffalo chicken was amazing, but feel free to add Texas Pete's hot sauce (there are plenty of bottles available) to give it some extra zing. The other slice was good, too, although a little heavy on the ricotta. Shockingly, I also got a side salad and couldn't believe it: all the veggies and lettuce were fresh and crunchy. Great value for just a few bucks. Don't fear trying one if you're not looking to get completely full throwing down an entire pie.",

I've eaten at this Fuel in downtown Charlotte for late night several times & the place is always packed. They're open after the bars close, so expect some long lines full of boozed up late nighters. And unlike some other late night options in Charlotte, Fuel takes quite a while to get your order placed, & then you have to wait again to actually get your food. This whole line/wait can take from 20 min up.  Once you get to the front of line, they have a lot of pizza topping options, from your basics to some odd ones. Along with pizza slice choices, they also have garlic knots which actually may be better than the pizza. When you finally do get your food, the pizza is nothing special, especially considering your wait. To me, it's just your average, run of the mill pizza.  I'd much rather have a different late night meal than pizza, but I still don't think their pizza is worth the wait. But if you really do crave pizza after bar hopping, then head to Fuel Pizza for a lengthy wait to satisfy your pizza hunger.",

If you happen to BE one of those drunken club goers, then you should fit right in. Just don't get too rowdy or the cops will drag you out of line and toss you outside.  I don't bother with the slices or premade calzones anymore...they are ok, but if I want left-overs I'll make them myself. Get a whole pizza here or try the wings (not bad for a pizza place).   The best time to go here is early evening on a weekend night when the weather is nice. They will usually open up the windows, letting the breeze and sounds of the city flow in. I like to sit by the open window with a friend, a large pizza, and some beers and watch the clubbers roll by on their way to the alley.

I discovered Fuel Pizza when my mother brought me a slice of their lasagna pizza and I was instantly intrigued. Their pizza is thin with delicious crust and the toppings are great. I like places with really great specialty pizzas and Fuel has some really great ones. They offer combos which I would suggest if it is your first visit. It's a cheap way to sample a couple different types of pizza without committing to an entire pizza. I would also suggest the garlic knots. This will renew any New Yorker's faith in finding a decent pizza place in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok, I know, cut the crap. It's just pizza.  My mom came to visit this weekend and we found ourselves at the door of Fuel - the neon sign beckoning us in - so we accepted the invitation. First impression: Truck stop? Where is the gasoline smell? I mean, if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck, that would draw in plenty of people! We were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door, literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain, what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good, not to sweet, but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile. I'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord. That's a real pie.",

The wings were good and spicy but not crazy hot. we've eaten a few other places since we've been here and this place was my favorite. Would definitely go back when we com back here",

I see there's many of them around the area, but doing geographic research, this is the one I went to (near S. 6th).  The service was on point, and surprisingly it wasn't that busy at all on a Friday night.  Me and my father split a buffalo chicken pizza along with 8 wings. I had no complaints about either the pizza or wings; I enjoyed the crust of the pizza -- it's thick and I guess it tastes kind of like a Ritz cracker. The pizza had buffalo sauce, blue cheese, as well as bits of carrots and celery.   As far as pizza in Charlotte, it's pretty good, although I think Brixx has slightly fresher pizza. But I can't complain with Fuel Pizza; it's quick and fast 'za!",

Then when we tried to get our money back, they handed us a pizza with 2 slices, instead of the large pizza we actually ordered. We had our receipt and STILL never got our money back nor a pizza. We paid $20, tipped well, and never got a pizza or our money back. Then they kicked us out of the restaurant and were rude. The employees also gave us fake names. I enjoy fuel pizza, but I recommend going to any location in Charlotte other than this one. They also told us \"they stopped serving water at 10 pm\" and also yelled at us for not ordering alcohol. I'm not one to write bad reviews but this was a terrible experience",

The food was not the best thing I've ever had. It was around 11pm after the game and we had 2 slices of pizza a small salad and 5 wings (garlic salt and pepper) and fries. Everything came to around $20 and it wasn't gross so I'm going to say we chalk this up to a win. Fuel Pizza not great but not bad either. If it's late and you're hungry give this place a try.",

I had so wished to update my review with a better rating, but I can only give them credit for a hot piece of pizza.  I was leaving work late one night and decided a quick slice of pizza would be easy. I called ahead and placed an order for a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni and a side salad.  Upon arriving the service was ridiculous. I do not think any of the workers care about customer service. Rude, short with customers and overall just made my pickup not pleasant.  My order was ready so I picked up the pizza box and bag and headed home. No salad dressing..UGH, I hate that. The pepperoni slice was good, but the cheese was made so sloppy with a spinkle of cheese, seriously. How do you mess up a slice of cheese pizza.  So, Fuel will not be my quick, go to spot when I am looking for something easy on a late night in the office.",

He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.  When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.  The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again.",

Good night for some pizza but it has been a long day and wanna go home too.  Place a order for pick up from this Fuel location, 2 blocks from home so perfect!  Arrive at the time I was told it would be done and guess what!?!  It is ready!!  Perfect!  Delighted because I wanna eat and get my butt to bed!  Walk home, pizza is still hot!  The pizza was amazing!  Better than I ever thought it would be!  To make the experience even better, the 2 employees that were on duty, great!  Wish I would have gotten their names so I could give them a proper shout out but they were great.  Will definitely consider this location for more than just a late night slice going forward!",

I want to give this place more stars since I have been to this location numerous nights out and this place has stood the test of time with all the BAR Charlottes, clubs, etc just catty-corner from here.  It makes me sad people write that this place is \"dirty\" but I think that all falls within the Fuel decor theme.... usually when I go the tables are tidy and everything else is in order.  It could be the concrete floor and the overall look with the vintage signs and machinery sprinkled about the dining area.  Dining format... just like any other Fuel location, you approach the counter order your food and get a number.  Once the slices have been re-heated through the oven a server will bring it to you at your table.  Drinks are self serve... staff are friendly enough.  Maybe because this location has been here for a while, the staff take their customers for granted and the service may not be as sharp as it may have once been.  This location does have a tiny patio and their front windows open up when the weather is nice.... it's a good option if you find yourself uptown, but I think the other location on the Green  is literally just 4 blocks away.  With the 7th Street Market and Pure Pizza doing their thing in the market, I guess it's a hard sell for me to walk another block for pizza that's okay.  Oh, I forgot, Brixx is nearby too... Maybe they should change the name of 1st ward to \"pizza ward.\"",

If you want anything spicer than mild, don't even partake - the wings are useless and have zero sauce.  Pizza is okay and staff can be friendly if you get them on the right night.  But mostly you should know they will charge you for extra sauce - including if you just want hot wings with hot sauce which would seem like a given. Only redeeming fact about this place is that they serve craft beer in cans.  Otherwise don't order the wings unless you like dry, sauce less wings.",

    "text": "So four of us came for pizza. We were so excited to have our first pizza in Charlotte! We ordered 2 pizzas and one came out is 10 minutes, yet our friends didn't receive their pizza for 45 minutes? We kept going up the the register to ask where's the pizza? The workers didn't seem apologetic and kept saying its coming. The pizza was delicious, however the service is lacking quite a bit.",

    "text": "I just had the worse experience at one of your locations. The cashier, Tianna Mckoy was unbelievably rude to me, ignored me multiple times, and refused to serve me. I told her I have a gluten and dairy allergy, because I saw online your establishment is safe! I was so excited to get some pizza. I asked for a gluten free pizza with daiya dairy free cheese and some buffalo chicken on top. She told me that wasn't possible and then ignored me. I said why not and she replied \"if you were a pizza maker you would understand\". She was so aloof and dismissive to me, I have never been treated so poorly. This is absolutely insane how rude everyone in the establishment was. I was with my boyfriend, and we both put our orders in. So much time passed and numbers were being called that were far past ours. We asked the people behind the counter and they didn't even hear of us! They didn't even have our order lined up! I can't believe how poorly I was treated over my food allergy. I can safely say this was a horrible experience.",
