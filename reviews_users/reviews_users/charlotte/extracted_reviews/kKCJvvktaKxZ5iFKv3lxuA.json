They have great lunch specials but I opted for the steak lo mein...the food was hot when it arrived at the table but I didn't like the flavors. It tasted very sweet to me, and was not a good compliment to the steak. I did like the way the steak was prepared though, very tender and juicy.   I will give them one more try but I will make sure to select another item on the menu. With all the great reviews, I'm hoping for a great next visit.",

That place is a mad house.  All of us Ballantyne Corporate Park people who were too lazy to bring our lunches from home saturate this place until its nearly standing room only.  The menu has some decent offerings, but I have to say I'm not a huge fan of their tofu.  It's cut very thin and has a rubbery texture.  They're also a bit too generous on the sauce even with a small portion; I've gotten in the habit of asking for it on the side because usually the dish was swimming in it.  Other than that, it's a decent place to dine.",

Also, my husband said he doesn't think the order was even put in until he got there, and the restaurant was basically empty, because this was around 3:30pm. I tried to call and speak with a manager, was told to hold, and placed on hold with very loud music for so long that I finally hung up. Like I said, great food, but not so great customer service.

Every meal I have had at Pei Wei has been well made and not over cooked (it's amazing how many people don't know how to cook broccoli). Their tofu is great (it's amazing how many people don't know how to cook tofu).  Even during the lunch rush, they are pretty good about getting out well made orders. I have never had a problem getting back to work on time taking a lunch here and that is important. The atmosphere is rather nice nice. Dimly lit but on a nice day there is a nice amount of sun light coming in through the large windows. Plenty of seating. I never once had to wait for a table during the lunch rush.  All around Pei Wei is a solid choice for lunch in Ballantyne area. Heck, it wouldn't even be a bad spot for a date. Oh, and yes, they do server beer. Not a great selection, but they do.",

What I do like, though, is that they've now got different sizes of food you can order. A small order is more than enough for one person. I have a hearty appetite, but recently I couldn't even finish a small order of the fried rice with steak.  The food is delivered to the table pretty quickly, the place is clean, and the employees are friendly. I enjoy going to this place for lunch or a quick dinner.",

I'm a tough consumer and I am a straight shooter; if it's good, I'll say it's good, if it's bad, I'm gonna say that too... so when I tell you that Pei Wei is worth battling the Ballentyne traffic and the 485 construction - you can believe it really is that good  :-)    I order online and pick it up- their online system is user friendly and easy to navigate, it's also easy to be very picky with your order, which I appreciate.  Their rangoons have more crab in them than anywhere else I've ever ordered them from.  Their wonton soup is also the best wonton soup I've ever had.  It's not the luke warm, super salty chicken broth with green onions floating on the top with slimy hunks of wet dough...  no- it's a light, very tasty broth, small, delicate wontons full of filling, actual fresh bok choy leaves floating on the top along with the green onions - LOVE IT!   (just remember- you have to request the fried noodles to float in your soup, they don't automatically offer them like other chinese places do).  Today I also tried their edamame, another hit  :-)    Pei Wei is operated by the P.F. Changs folks, which makes sense.  It's a great place to go for quick, fresh, very tasty chinese food  :-)",

When you walk in to order togo the menu is on 2 screens. You would think the purpose of this would be to order using a touchscreen. But not. Its just 2 screens and makes absolutely no sense to me. I guess behind the screens the servers can enter your order, but why not add more functionality to the front for customers? If you ask me they are pretty slow! I normally set aside 20 minutes to order and get my food. I love their food mainly because I can get SHRIMP instead of typical chicken or beef. The Honey Seared Shrimp is so delicious. Crispy shrimp in a honey sauce, where can you go wrong? I also love the Sushi. The Mango California roll is really good. I'm not a Sushi connoisseur or anything so it works for me.

As a result, Pei Wei has become my standby for acceptable, reasonably priced Chinese. It has good, solid Asian flavors. Nothing extraordinary, nothing amazing, and almost always too high in sodium, but at least the flavors work.   I've had many things on the menu and tend to rotate between the Mandarin Kung Pao, Pei Wei Spicy and the occasional Orange Peel. Truth be told, the sauces are all kind of similar, just the veggies change out.   I'm not a fan of their wonton soup, it tries too hard to be fancy. The hot and sour soup is not hot enough. Usually I go with either the lettuce wraps or the spring rolls if I want an appetizer.   I still wish I could find a good Chinese place, but in the interim, Pei Wei works.",

But in recent months I have been disappointed by the food quality and portions of the some of the dishes. But of course the prices have steadily increased.   On our last outing, we ordered the asian chopped chicken salad and asked for extra chicken. We did takeout and when we got home saw they there was barely any chicken on the salad much less the extra portion that they charged us for. I called them back up spoke with the manager who apologized and prepared another portion of chicken for me to pick up- it's hassle to return to a store to get what you were supposed to get the first time.  Otherwise, I have noticed that their Pad Thai and Rice Bowls have gotten skimpy on the meat as well and the egg rolls are smaller. Overall,  I am not sure what you get is worth the price. You are probably better off at a local Chinese restaurant.",

It is pretty spicy without killing your taste buds. There was some veggies in the dish but wish there was more.

You order your food and then receive a number to take to your table for your food to be brought to you. I was with a group of about six or seven and our \"waitress\" was either incredibly new or incredibly uninterested in learning the menu. She consistently brought each person the wrong meal they ordered. And then when she would bring the food out, she wasn't sure which meal was which. She couldn't tell the difference between a meal with chicken or tofu. It got to the point where the service was so comically bad, we thought it was all an elaborate joke.

Eventually these folks will figure out a lunch service and then the young people crowding this place will probably keep coming back.  For a middle-aged professional who doesn't care about the cool new place - I'll skip it.  So many places give you food faster, for less money, with good flavor.   Details: me and a buddy went here for lunch today, I ordered the Dan Dan noodles with chicken.  My friend ordered a single egg roll and the spicy peanut thing.  It took us 10 minutes to get to the counter to make that simple order.  Then we sat down and waited.  And waited. 40 MINUTES LATER the egg roll comes after the a cook came out from the back to try to figure out the distribution mess in front of house.  My friend shared the egg roll because we were starving and he is nice - it was luke warm but had good flavor.  7 minutes after that our food comes, literally 47 minutes after I ordered.  I checked the receipt.  We were within a minute of going up for refunds. My dish had sprouts, noodles and chicken.  The ends of the sprouts still had dirt on them, not a lot but they didn't look properly rinsed, like the cooks were rushed??  Or not enough prep time in the morning.  The chicken on this dish is ground chicken, like hamburger, and there were chewy bits like ground up joints or gristle - not edible anyway.  I left 2/3 of the chicken on the plate. My friend's chicken was larger pieces that looked better cooked.  All this for 12.40 including a medium fountain drink.  Really?  I'll go to Farley's where you get a great pizza and drink for 9 (lunch special), or House of Leung where you get good flavor under 7 and table service.  Or jeez, go to Salsarita's, or Zapata's.  Zapata's is great and you get chips & salsa, right in the same plaza. Boardwalk Billy's or Showmar's - also better values.",

    "text": "Damn it Pei Wei, your food's pretty good but out of the 10-ish or so times I've been here, my order has been COMPLETELY right only three times (one of those times I just ordered edamame). What gives??  I don't have crazy orders, I just like to leave certain ingredients out (sugar snap peas, string beans, onions, scallions, ginger, & cilantro) but one or more of those things inevitably makes it into my stir-fry. Most of the people who take the orders do a great job of reading everything back, so it has to be the cooks who aren't reading the order carefully enough which I guess isn't a HUGE deal, but very annoying. If you have food allergies I would probably avoid this place since the cooks may overlook whatever modifications you make to the menu.  Also, one time some old, stupid bitch took my order. I'm not sure if she still works there anymore, it was a couple of years ago, but while I was telling her my order she kept interrupting me, rather rudely, every time I told her to leave something out. I understand that the Thai Dynamite or Honey Seared or whatever I ordered that day does not normally come with snap peas & string beans, but since I am ordering it with tofu & VEGGIES, they automatically add that shit in & I do not want them.. not sure why she couldn't comprehend that & why she was so rude & kept interrupting me. I was pretty pissed & wanted to eat somewhere else, but decided to stay because the BF really wanted to try the Caramel Chicken.  A couple of highlights are the chili garlic sauce they serve and if you order your meal with tofu and veggies, you don't get boring regular tofu that's usually mushy. I don't know the name of this preparation (pressed tofu maybe?) but they serve you the delicious, meatier firm bean curds with the brown edges* which I LOVE & why this two-star place gets an extra star from me!  *Just looked it up. This tofu preparation is called five spices tofu.. So so so good!! Pei Wei, I wish I could say the same about you, though.",

My issue is the overall flavor of the food, as it is definitely different than normal Chinese food. To put it eloquent, it is yucky. To be fair, if you like Asian Fusion type food, then you will probably like this restaurant.  My husband likes this restaurant and pops over for lunch from time to time- thus the 2 stars instead of 1 for me.",

Downsides: The food (both mine and my husband's) was extremely sweet- and shouldn't have been for what we ordered. Also, the ladies restrooms were in need of more frequent cleaning and I'll leave that there to be polite.   Overall, pretty good food if you like sweet meats and sauces.",

Being that I wasn't too hungry, I decided to give a few appetizers a try. I ordered the wonton soup, pork egg roll, and crab ran goons. All were fabulous, but the pork egg roll was my favorite. Steaming hot, with a great filling of ground pork, scallions, carrots, and a few others things, served w/ a hot mustard sauce, amazing. The soup was warm and had three great wontons. As for the crab, filled and served w/ a chili sauce. Another thing to point out, the service was great. I look forward to returning, for another egg roll & an entree this time.",

I had heard some good things about pei wei and when I arrived, there was a relatively long line so it seemed promising. However, the food was not nearly good enough to be a place I would return to.",

Yet great prices and no waiter service (though they do bring the food out to you initially).   The decor at this location is very tasteful and modern. Love the wood beams along the ceiling!  This location usually has a number of families and kids... Par for the Ballantyne location.   Parking lot looks small but I've always found a spot pretty easily. There is a dedicated spot for take out parking right up front. Note that the entrance off Ballantyne Commons has changed recently as they have added a median.   Definitely recommend to hit this place up for a nice sit down meal or takeout!",

Regardless of what cuisine you call it, it's just not good.  The ingredients used are low quality and most of the dishes I've tried are WAY WAY too sweet.. they must put a ton of sugar in there, and it really turns you off to the dish and makes you feel horrible by the time you're finishing.  It seems they pile on the sugar to cover the taste of the cheap ingredients.    If you're someone who downs sweet tea and thinks Domino's is good pizza, then this place will be great for you.  If you like the complexity of well prepared quality flavors/ingredients, this place will be a big disappointment.    I guess to be more fair and put it in perspective, this place is to Asian food as Jack in the Box is to a home grilled burger.",

You basically pick what style of entree you want, then choose your protein (chicken, beef, tofu. shrimp) or extra veggies.  Like Chang's, they incorporate elements of several Asian cultures.  The food is definitely good, and the brown, nutty steamed rice is delicous too.  Though still pretty cheap at about $8 for most entress, you have to pay extra if you want side items and those are expensive.  A spring roll is $2, crab wontons are about $1 each but sold in orders of 2,4, or 6.  If it wasn't for the slightly high price compared to our local Chinese restaurant, I'd give them 4 stars, plus the local place seems to have larger portions.  That being said, however, a bogo free coupon from Pei Wei definitely made me go check it out again and it was a nice change.  If you want some of PF Chang's food served quicker and cheaper, go here.",

I always take-out my order, and ordering online is my suggested method, and you can even pay at the restaurant as opposed to online, though that is an option. It is my go-to when I have a late flight and I literally order as I head to long term parking. The Korean spicy is awesome, as well as the lettuce wraps. As for ordering convenice, location, price, and quality of cuisine, you can't beat it!",

A number of offerings, all with options as to meat (steak or chicken), type of rice (brown or white) and style (the option chosen).  Very simple and there is a large menu board that you can peruse prior to the ordering station, so step aside if you are new to Pei Wei so the experienced hands can stream by you.  You can also order a beverage.  I ordered tea.  Got a hot cup and could only find the two containers of iced tea (sweet and unsweet) and an urn of hot water.  Ummm.  Other that rapidly moving servers there is no help available and being lunch time it was just a couple of chairs short of full.  I opted to put some iced tea into my hot cup and topped it off with hot water.  Portions are of two sizes: small and regular. I had the small and it was.  A measured scoop of rice and my main portion.  Should have ordered the regular which I spied at adjacent tables to be more generous.  If you are on a diet, go small.  This is an in and out place.  Order, sit, eat and go.  There are condiments, which, happily included hot mustard above the drink counter.    Well run, very clean and tables were bused and reoccupied quickly.  The food was OK...sweet to my taste and lots of soy.",

I could have gone to a full service restaurant and had my meal quicker.  I noticed others were waiting a long time and were looking for their food.  And then the chicken in my dish was over cooked and tough.  Noodles were very oily too.  One of the servers was very unfriendly and when I asked about the delay, he didn't even respond to me.  Very poor management.  No one walked around to see how things were going.  Terrible service.  Unlikely that I would return.  Competition is tough for that price range and Pei Wei did not deliver.",

    "text": "I love Pei Wei (and PF Changs) and enjoy being able to grab a quick bite for lunch or dinner. Food, service, atmosphere, etc are all pretty consistently good and worthy of a recommendation.   However, the last time I went I was pretty blown away (enough so to motivate me to share my experience)! My boyfriend and I went in on Sunday afternoon for lunch. We both ordered Wok dishes (me- Mongolian beef and him- caramel chicken), fixed our drinks and found a table. Within minutes my dish came out, quickly served hot and delicious per usual. We had planned to kind of share our meals so we both started picking at the plate. A few more minutes pass and before we even realize that his meal hadn't come yet, an employee comes over and apologizes for the long wait and overs my BF a free appetizer of his choice. He orders crab rangoons. They almost immediately bring 4 rangoons out and then before he/we can even eat all of them here comes his dish. We felt lucky!   But the customer service gets even better!! We're sitting there happily chomping away on the (way too much) food we now have in front of us when another employee walks over with a receipt in her hand. She says that her manager apologizes for our long wait and has refunded both of our meals to the card we paid with. WHAT?! We *didn't even complain* and had already been completely satisfied.   Talk about good restaurant management! Props to Pei Wei for satisfying their customers before they even get a chance to complain!",

    "text": "YUM!  As a lover of PF Changs Mongolian Beef, Pei Wei makes a spot on version quickly.  Arriving on a pretty Friday in spring, I was one of the first people in around 11:20, but by noon the place was packed to the gills, the Ballantyne crowd must really like their quick Chinese food, and while this is quick Chinese food, it is of better quality, and along with that a higher cost, than your typical Chinese takeout joint.  Parking lot is a hot mess. Spots are the new norm of slightly larger than a compact spot and you have 90% of the lot as SUV's and minivans, so be prepared to crawl into a back window to get into your car.  You have a combination of people who work nearby and appeared to be on a time constraint and Ballantyne housewives who have nowhere to be and all day to get there.  There is also a small subset of people who have never seen a Coke Freestyle machine before (the same people who start getting their shit together at the ATM once they are in front of the machine and also write checks at the grocery store still).  Inside is LOUD.  There is the clang of the woks, the chairs scraping across the hard floor and folks talking.  LOUD.  Walk along the wall to the counter where you will place your order and get a cup for your drink and a number to put on your table.  Someone will bring your food to you.  The food: Mongolian Beef with white rice ($9) - Exactly the same as the PF Changs version, only you don't get to see the giant horses on the way in.  It was a nice lunchtime portion, and arrived SMOKING hot to the table. Snickerdoodle cookie ($1) - soft and snickerdoodly.   Drink - Coke Freestyle machine - SCORE!  I was very happy with my cherry ginger ale.  I work and live closer to PF Changs, and since they now have lunch portions for very reasonable prices, that include a cup of soup, I will probably not frequent Pei Wei, but should I find myself in the area, I definitely would not hesitate to try some appetizers and get another delicious order of Mongolian Beef.",

There was a parking spot out front for pick ups for on line ordering, so I thought WTH, I should try this.  I was alone, so there was no need for a comfy cozy atmosphere other than that of my car.  I placed my order on my phone and walked in five minutes later.  Within five minutes I had my food, bagged up and ready to go.  I ordered a salad with orange chicken. It was on a bed of Asian noodles and came with a lime based dressing.  It really hit the spot. I also ordered a vegetable roll.  Of course, it was deep fried and good.  (Have you ever had anything deep fried that wasn't tasty?)  So, all in all, it was a fast, good experience.  The app worked perfectly.  I would love to use that app again when I am back in the Ballantyne area with hunger pangs and alone!",

One thing that always gets a plus in my book is the access to lemons for my water. I came here at an odd time of day (like 3 pm) so it was almost totally empty inside. Great for ordering! No line to wait in and the food came out really quick! We had a 4 piece appetizer of the California mango sushi and it was REALLY GOOD! I will definitely be coming back for that! I had the broccoli ginger rice bowl with chicken. It was really good but you can definitely tell it's a chain restaurant by the way the food looks and is served. They had a ton of options from bowls to salads to entrees. Next time I come back I need to try some of their edamame and their crab Rangoon. I'm a sucker for both of those so I was happy to see them as a part of their menu.",

I ordered the hot and sour soup which I did enjoy, but that's the only reason for 2 stars. The entree I ordered was steak teriyaki. The steak was overcooked and hard. The vegetables included onions, thinly sliced carrots, and spinach. I don't have a problem with any of these, except the carrots were so thin they ended up becoming a soggy clumpy mess. Larger cuts would have been better. Also I found bits of fried dough that obviously came from a different meal that was prepared in my same wok before mind. It was disgusting. All of it ended up becoming muddled and soggy. I couldn't finish it. There are plenty of decent American Chinese food and poke restaurants around for MUCH better than this. We won't be back.",

Must pull from separate  places depending on the dish. Still, love this place when I can't get to PF Chang's. Service was great. If your hot on a summer day hit this place up.

Today the lettuce wraps were really lacking in the chicken department and really just seemed like I was eating water chestnut wraps which was disappointing.

The chicken and noodles were boiled and that was it. No flavor at all. We got an order of crab rolls that were a bit slimy and not very good either. The Kung Pao beef saved our dinner. Although the meat was over cooked at least it had flavor. About the only positive about the meal were the crab wontons. Total disappointment.

You can't go wrong with their hot and sour soup or the lettuce wraps, but I'm a huge fan of the Vietnamese Chicken Salad rolls and the peanut sauce they come with. Their sushi is also pretty tasty, especially the wasabi crunch roll. Don't let the name fool you though, its not spicy at all, but you can add their chili sauce and wasabi for the spicy kick!   The ordering is similar to a Panera or other sit down/step above fast food places. It's easy to order and they also do online ordering to avoid the lunch rush with all the businesses in Ballantyne.",

The frozen PF Chang egg rolls were better than these.  Bummer.",

Service is very efficient and the food is served in minutes, comes out as it's prepared.  The staff are polite and friendly, and very accommodating.    The pricing was very reasonable and matched that of the typical upscale fast-food restaurants such as Panera, Chipotle and the like.

    "text": "Horrible experience. I saw online they opened at 11am and wanted to come here right when they opened because I was on my lunch break and had only 30 mins. I came here right at 11am and opened the door and it was locked. I waited a few mins because maybe they just needed a second. 11:07 am rolls by and the door is still locked. I called them and no one answered.   I waited about 11:10 am and finally a kid unlocks the door. Doesn't even open the door for me. I asked him if they opened at 11 and he said yes. I asked why did I just wait 10 mins outside if they opened at 11 and he said \"We were busy!\" and walked off. What the hell!!! They aren't even open yet and you are going to say you were busy!! No one obviously was in the restaurant except for the workers. I did see they had to go orders but shouldn't they be more prepared?? I'm on my lunch break and just waited 10 mins outside for nothing. My time is just as important as theirs!! I walked up and the girl was unfriendly. Doesn't even greet me just ask if it's here or to go. I asked her why didn't they open at 11 and she immediately started to blink a lot and started to shake and said that they were really busy. Ok, I'm just as busy as you. I was hoping to leave at 11:10 with my food so I can make it back and now I'm having to just now order at 11:10. I placed my order and decided with the ramen with shrimp and beef. There was no where in the to go area for me to sit because they had something on each and every chair. No one even apologizes to me for waiting for so long. They could care less. I got my order and headed back to work.   I open my food and there was hardly any sauce in it. The beef was tough. And there were hardly any veggies in it. Waste of time and money. The staff needs to be friendlier and most importantly open on time and be more considerate.",

Food came out quickly, maybe a little quickly (explained later).  The Chicken rolls were pretty tasty especially with the accompanying peanut and spicy dipping sauce.  I fee that some basic veggie rolls would be a great addition to the menu.  They have Veggie Springrolls but they are fried instead of the soft, translucent rice wrappers.     The \"rice bowl\"  was spicy and pretty tasty!  Couple of comments about it though: it felt rushed since the sugar snap peas felt more raw than even flash fried and the plate was lacking enough sauce to cover all of the noodles.  The sauce issue was rectified when I was given addition sauce, but the pea issue remained! Luckily, I like raw sugar snap peas raw but would have preferred them in here a little more cooked.   Flavorwise it was delicious.. The Korean was spicy so beware if you are not a spicy person!  Staff was nice and the atmosphere was clean and pleasant.",

Once I figured out it was Pei Wei, she asked what drink I wanted. I told her I wanted sweet tea. She said \"if they don't have sweet tea, what carbonated drink do you want?\" I told her coke.

Fifteen minutes later I drove in and my food was ready to go. All I did was waited for one person ahead of me for about a min then I paid my bill and my bag was ready to go :)  As I stated earlier, I been here few times and we have enjoyed our visit every single time. This place is always neat and clean. Customer service is great, what I really like is the fact that you pay for food when you order and they bring your food to the table so you can just walk out when you are done. You don't have to wait for waiter to come by for check and then wait again until they bring your receipt so that you can sign and get done with it.   One thing I would recommend is that ask lot of question when you order about their different sauce and how they taste, that way you get the type of food you desire and you leave with happy ending.",

Better selection because it isn't just \"Chinese.\"  Also because there isn't a focus on service, the food goes straight to your table as soon as it is ready.  It always comes to the table very hot.

I felt a little rushed, though, because of the line behind me and I wasn't sure of the items on the menu, or how the combo worked vs. a specialty meal.  Plus not all of the items on the menu had prices so I couldn't judge much by that either.  I randomly chose the Honey Seared Shrimp dish, which was delicious, but I felt guilty with every bite since it was so heavily covered in the honey sauce.  Love the rice noodles with it though!  First came the WonTon soup to share, which was okay.  Then 4 pc. Crab Wontons, also, okay.  Others ordered the Teriyaki chicken combo, and liked it a lot, but thought the Spring rolls were boring.  They agreed that for $3 more they would have gotten the specialty dish and skipped the roll, while I thought for $3 more I got almost the same amount of meat as they did.  Overall, I don't think I'd go out of my way to go there again, but wouldn't pass it up if the opportunity arose with friends, and I had some extra $$ on hand.  I do agree with others who it was better than P.F. Chang's.",

As an offshoot of the PF Chang chain, it originated in the Phoenix area about a decade ago, and was in SoCal about eight years ago. It serves food quickly from a pan-Asian menu in the fast-casual style--stand in line to place your order and pay, then take your seat and the food is (usually) delivered in about 10 minutes.  I have the same thing every time: Kung Pao chicken on white rice. The vegetables are crisp, the chicken is plentiful and good, the serving is just the right size. That, a beer, and the chance to sit and relax a little while after eating, gives me a great night out after work.  Heartily recommended.",

I found this interesting looking fast food place (apparently fast food by PF Chang's?) I decided to try it. I ended up having it 3 times in as many days. The menu is very ordinary. However, the food was totally unexpected. The pad thai was really good. It's nothing like the authentic thai dish, but the creation provided a great alternative taste. I added about 3 spoon full of the vietnamese chili sauce. The combination well deserved my stomach space. All that for 8 bucks. The drink was complimentary if you get the food to go!  Extras: (Scale of 0-1)  0.8  Service 0.2: This appears to be a well manages chain. The service was good. The food got to me fast. I can't complain.   Decor 0.2: It might be billed as \"fast food\", the restaurant is actually well appointed. It's a good experience even for eat in.  Speed 0.2:   Dessert 0:   Prices 0.2: Check out their web site.....most common dished are 7 or 8 bucks. The specialties are just a bit more.  My score for this experience is 3.9 stars. I'm bumping it up to 4. A week after my last experience, I'm still drooling just thinking about the pad thai.",

I got the Mongolian beef and although the taste is not bad, once again, there just is not much to it.

You order at the counter, they give you a number and then they bring your food out to you.   We got the lettuce wraps as an app and they were really good - they tastes the same as they do at PF Changs. I ordered a weird shrimp dish which I wasn't so thrilled avoid, but I don't really like shrimp so I don't know why I ordered it in the first place. It was good enough for what it was.

These screens show the different options on the menu: salads, noodle and rice bowls, signature dishes, etc.   I ordered the new Thai chicken wrap and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad. The Thai Chicken wrap was very disappointing. The chicken tasted like fish!! That really threw me off, and the flavors did not taste Thai at all. I couldn't eat more than two lettuce wraps before the fish taste made me want to gag.   BUT the spicy chicken that came with the salad was pretty good for cheap American imitation of Chinese flavors. The salad itself was also really refreshing. The only issue I had with it was that there was way too much spicy chicken sauce that covered the salad. Next time, I'd ask for less sauce.   Overall, the experience was to be expected for Americanfied Chinese food. However, I probably will just stick to authentic Chinese food for around the same price.   [39 of 100]",

    "text": "I'm blaming my sister for this one.  She claimed this was a similar version to PF Changs (or so someone lied to her).  It's faaar from it.  This is fast order quasi-Asian style that tastes worse than the grocery store deli version - and that's faster and better tasting than here.  I think the pricing is obsurd for what they're calling fresh food (\"fast\" doesn't mean fresh).  It was bland.   I had a spring roll, Vietnamese style with two sauces that did not improve the flavor. I also tried my kids California rolls and a teriyaki something.  Something was up with the rice - overcooked, overprocessed?  I don't know but we all agreed this was not up to our par that we expect for sushi (all items are cooked, sort of Korean style but that's a stretch too). Finally after everyone else at the table was already finished with their food, my sister's \"spicy\" bowl chicken something came out.  It had waaay too much scallions (not even diced ir chopped; halved pieces), the chicken was battered so it was more like flavorless nuggets on a HUGE portion of brown rice and she asked for vegetables, which was what she picked at.  I tried it since she was making a weird face, it wasn't spicy, more tangy sweet and really heavy with all the carbs. $40 later we all left unfulfilled and went home to nibble on other food.  Message me if you'd like my opinion on better nearby sushi bars, Vietnamese or Thai restaurants.",

But sometimes, you just gotta have a fast, guilty pleasure, fake Chinese food meal, and I have no problem going to Pei Wei for it.   Perhaps Pei Wei holds a special place in my heart, because I ate it all the time living in Kansas, among all the casual chain eateries.  It's reasonably priced, and super consistent.  Entrees can come with brown rice, which is a huge plus.  This location's got a Freestyle soda machine (strawberry Sprite Zero anybody?)   TIP:  Check out their website/FB page for deals, like BOGO diner select entrees.  (Diner selects are half the size of the full entree, and include a side like wonton soup or an egg roll.)   TIP #2: Lunch is crazy busy with all the businesses nearby with workers in need of noshing.  Plan accordingly for a bit of a wait.",

We had been overseas for a few weeks, and we dreamed of returning to Pei Wei to enjoy some Sweet and Sour Chicken, plus a giant Dr. Pepper from the Coca Cola Freedom machine.  Within three hours of landing back in Charlotte, we were at Pei Wei, with our Sweet and Sour Chicken ordered.  However, the Freedom machine was out of Dr. Pepper.  Out of Dr. Pepper!  But, to the rescue came Pei Wei's Chris.  He ran out to the store next door with some Pei Wei cash in hand, and he brought us back an entire two liter bottle of cold Dr. Pepper!  We were so surprised, so glad to see the Dr. Pepper in Chris' hands.  Unbelievable Customer Service.  If we could give Chris and the entire team a million stars, we would!  Thanks for making our return to the USA GREAT!",
