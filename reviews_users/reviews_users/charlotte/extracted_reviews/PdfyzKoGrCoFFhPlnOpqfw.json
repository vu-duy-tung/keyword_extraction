I ordered the Bun Tom Nuong (vermicelli with shrimp) and unfortunately was not pleased. The shrimp had to be small shrimp but they were butterflied to seem bigger. The shrimp also had no seasoning on it whatsoever. It seems as if they steamed the shrimp and that was it. I have been to other establishments, like Vietnam Grille or Saigon Palace that cost around the same price but give you large seasoned grilled shrimp. I wanted to try this place because I like trying new places and this was closest to my job. I would have returned the dish but I only had a 30 min lunch break. Until they improve the dish, I'll stick to what I know.",

The chicken is seasoned an roasted to perfection. The sticky rice is fluffy an good. The kimchi is just how I like it.

I have even seen staff get supplies at food lion next door which might explain why the pho doesn't taste as authentic  but that's just my thought on it. My advice for anyone looking for some good pho or Vietnamese food in general to go to Doans, which isn't too far. It is very good, big portions and actually somewhat cheaper than pho cali.",

What more can we ask for? Pho and shrimp? Yes please! We ordered a large bowl of pho tai and bo vien and 2 pounds of shrimp. The waiter tore a piece of paper to cover the table and bought over a bucket with a roll of paper, 2 bibs and gloves. This is the first time I  was given a pair of glove to eat shrimp. The pho came out first. It was quite delicious. The waiter came over with a plastic bag wrapped in another plastic bag that held our lemon pepper shrimp. The shrimp was seaming hot. The flavor was peppery with a hint of lemon. Shrimp was a good size. I have never been so happy to be wearing gloves while eating shrimp. My hands weren't as smelly as they could have been thanks to the gloves.",

The only complaint about this dish was the peanut sauce wasn't to our liking. It was good just not our favorite in town. I had the #16 which is Pho with rare and well cooked beef, tripe, flank, and tendon. I was pleased with the soup. The tripe was a little chewy, but I've only found one place in charlotte where it wasn't so that was expected. Overall my meal was great. My husband had the # 11 (well and rare beef and meatballs) he finished the entire large bowl, which means he was pleased.   The place itself was very clean and somewhat quiet. There were just two other tables taken, so not too much chatter. Service was great. We tend to ask a lot of our servers because we seem to always need something.

The price was also very reasonable, particularly given the high quality, fresh ingredients. Next time I'm in town, I'll be sure to return here.",

    "text": "So disappointed. We hoped to find another option for pho and bun vermicelli and was quite disappointed. There was no one else there but us. It's the Grand Opening and we were hoping for a good meal. Wow. No bubble teas. Only smoothies. The menu items are very limited ... Only 4 pages (2 total front and back) of options to choose from.  The pho was not aromatic at all. Yes, bland as the other reviewer stated. The prices for pho were average. My husband ordered a large Pho Dac Biet and with a good pho soup broth, you need not add anything but spiciness if needed. This bowl needed fish sauce and way too much hoisin sauce and the color was just of water. No rich broth.  The Bun Vermicelli with pork was not good. The lettuce was cut too roughly (large) making it difficult to eat. There was little pork and the pork only tasted of sugar. No savory aromatic shallot and garlic flavor.   We will never go again. This place will not last. We are Asian and we love Vietnamese and now that we have scratched it itch to try it, we will not be back. Food is everything! Although the service was good, the food would not even be considered mediocre. It was NOT AUTHENTIC AT ALL and no matter how good service is, it is not enough for us to go back. Sorry.",

So we pick this place. I opted for Pho.. I ordered no# 1 which is summer rolls and no# 41 which is grilled pork with poke ground pork with eggs and among other things for little man. The main Man order something with chicken, which he likes!  I'm ok with my pho.. A little bland but I wasn't sure if it's just me since I been under the weather..  But little man's food was all out of wacked. The summer rolls turns out to be fried spring rolls, which I nodded too.. Don't know why.. And his dinner is a no# 40 which is originally suppose to be #41. By the time it arrived. All the food is out.. So I don't feel like sending things back.. Little man  have to deal.. The main dish he had has nothing but cut up grilled pork and 3 pieces of half shrimps. I tried the shrimp. Meh!! The pork pieces was also ok.. He didn't finish any of it.. The fried rolls was too oily.. I didn't know why I wrapped it to take home.. He won't eat it later..  Customer service is ok.. I have to look at her a few times to get her attention.. I'm hoping to go back again so I can update my review.. Because I can't believe the orders can be that out of wacked when I'm telling her just the no# and not the full name. I know I won't even try because my Vietnamese sucks.. Why torture the poor girl!",

We got all the flavors to try but I liked the tangy cajun flavor the BEST. The waitress was very sweet and helpful with us today. Overall, service has always been good here. All their workers (especially the girls there) are always so pleasant and nice, I really loved that about them. Just thrilled to have decent crawfish nearby! Although the crawfish weren't big, it was a thumbs up in my eyes.  So yummy regardless!  Wished they had flavored milk tea and fruit infused tea though.  As for their Pho, I'm not too thrilled about it because it's not that good nor flavorful but it does satisfy cravings when I don't feel like driving across town.  Their shaken beef with tomatoes rice is really good though. I heard from friends the sticky rice with steamed chicken were good as well. I personally think their prices are a little overpriced (especially the seafoods) but I guess we'll have to deal with it because they just don't care, lol.",

    "text": "After much recommendations to try this place out. I suggested it to my husband when he was craving some crawfish similar to our favorite that closed last year.   He went out and tried it with family and they all liked it and rave how much similarities it had to our favorite crawfish joint.  Today, I finally tried this place out and it's a Vietnamese restaurant with the seafood option. Pretty good especially when you're craving a bowl of seafood while others around you wants to eat pho, etc.   [MY REVIEW IS SOLELY BASED ON THE SEAFOOD]  I got the #1 combo which consisted of black mussels, clams, crawfish and shrimp. It also came with two pieces of Italian sausage, two pieces of potatoes and three pieces of corn on the cob. The medium was spicy but I was still able to enjoy the meal without building up a sweat. :) My 6yr old and I were able to finish majority of it although if my husband were to eat some, we would've been able to finish it. Thus being, two adults sharing a bowl and it would be plenty. Now, the seafood is in a bag. They steam the seafood and then I'm assuming bag it, add the sauce, shake it up and serve.   What I liked about it:  They use a sauce to flavor up the seafood. Unlike the other joint down the street which used a dry seasoning.  Crawfish and the other seafood were indeed fresh. The crawfish were huge which is a plus. The portion of the extras included (corn, sausage, and potatoes) were decent.   What I didn't like: The corn tasted a bit off as if it was previously boiled or was sitting in a pot of water overnight. It had a slight off taste.   The restaurant is a bit small. So if you're bringing a large group, call ahead and reserve a table. Restrooms are pretty clean but nothing too special. No changing tables (for those mommies out there). Decor was those nets hanging around. It's okay considering they serve seafood and it was too tacky.   Overall, if you liked Flamin' then you'll love it here. Only downside is that they don't have the MyTeas which was a favorite to compliment the spicy mix of seafood.",

My only complaint was that waiting for take-out took time, but that was only because they were packed FULL for lunch. To me, that's a great sign.

Also the fried calamari was delicious! The sweet potato fries were a hit, especially for dipping in extra sauce.  They have great specials every day, some where you get an entire extra pound of shrimp/clams for free when you order the special combo of the day. So call ahead to find out the daily discount available. The only lame part of the experience is that portions are small, for everything.. So we ended up needing to order double to feel satisfied and the price they charge for extra corn/sausage. It's around 75 cents per piece! Delicious but it's gonna cost ya to be full!",

The flavor is definitely overhyped, but it tastes good. If you don't know what I'm talking about Google the fruit Durian, is a weird looking fruit infamous because of its odor, but I'd you get past it you are rewarded with a very delicious flavor.  As far as food goes, everything is made fresh so you can make every dish in the menu a vegetarian one, spring rolls are amazing. I didn't love the peanut sauce, I thought the flavor was very overwhelming for the fresh roll, and once you dip your roll in it all you can taste is peanut.   I ordered the seafood pho which consists of crab, shrimp and squid. As a recommendation I would skip the crab because the pho will over cook it and the meat will get a weird texture. If you do order the crab make sure that's the first thing you eat.   The staff is very friendly, and it seems like they get a lot of regulars because they automatically noticed I was a new customer, we chit chatted for a few minutes after I paid, and they were all very friendly.

    "text": "Meh. Not worth it, if you are expecting a decent amount of food for the price. The seafood kind of smelled more fishy than I'm used to. Like it's been sitting out for a while. Service was slow, even if it wasn't busy; but I already expected that from reading previous reviews. I have server experience, so the \"service was slow\"  was an understatement.  I got to try out these items: Summer rolls: the best thing I had to eat that night Prawn rolls: 2nd best Chicken wings/ spicy: basic fried chicken with dry chili pepper powder on top- meh Shrimp and King crab/ house sauce/med spicy: a bit salty for my tastes, but at least it's edible. Or maybe it's edible because I'm pooling a lot of money for it.  Broken rice with grilled pork: not impressed. I've had better. Looked like a kid sized portion.   Overall it's not worth coming back to this place. They were not busy on a Saturday night (6-8), which means it probably isn't a restaurant worth fighting to eat at.",

However, I had the good fortune of getting a job around the area and gave it another shot:  it became my go-to for days I had time for long lunches as the service and pho both drastically improved. My girlfriend and I shared so many meals here to point that the staff just brought out our usual when we showed up: 1 regular beef pho + 1 large beef pho with extra tendons. Pho Cali is definitely one of the things I miss most about working near Whitehall / Ayrsley.",

The bowl sizes werent a big difference but the prices were. The broth was good and sweet. We were full and pleased with the food.   We have been searching for a good spot for pho and Charlotte does not have any... But this place may be a contender. We just hope the second visit will be the same and their consistency of good food is there. The other pho restaurants don't have any consistency. Most Pho restaurants in Charlotte are rip offs.   We like this place and the workers seem nice here. It was pretty slow for them in the morning but when its a good restaurant then i'd support them any way I can.   Con: the avocado smoothie and thai tea isnt great. Too much ice in my smoothie and the thai tea is too milky and sweet.  So the food is good but the drinks are ok..  See you soon Pho Cali!",

Use the money you would have spent on crawfish here to buy gas.  Get some Pho... I'm sure it's pretty good.    We paid $40 each and left here hungry.  Crawfish were mixed in size but were mostly tiny.  Shells were rubbery as if they had been cooked twice which made peeling them a real pain.  The tiny ones were easily destroyed in the process of peeling them.  Anyway they were severely over cooked.  We also had the shrimp... they were also over cooked and probably were from frozen based on my experience, but they were descent size and the best thing we had here.  Corn was also over cooked or old.  Potatoes were large but didn't absorb any flavor during cooking.  Sausage was Italian sausage not cajun sausage as we were expecting.   Service was very good and the place was clean... I would not hesitate to return for some Pho but I wouldn't drive 2 hours for that.",

I wasnt sure which dish would be best for a novice so I asked my server and he recommended \"Pho Dac Biet\", Special Combo W/Rare , Well Cooked   Beef ,Tenderloin, Tripe & Beefballs. He said that this had a lot of meat in it and he thought it would be good for a first time Pho eater so I went with it.  The server brought out fresh veggies & herbs to add to the soup; bean sprouts, jalepenos, fresh mint & lime wedges. The soup bowl was massive and the broth and ingredients were flavorful. Big pieces of beef and light rice noodles. The veggies were a good addition to the broth. Watch out for the jalapeno, the heat took my breath away and lead to a coughing jag! Overall a good experience for my first Pho!",

You could probably fit a good 70 people.   Interesting enough they have seafood on the menu....crawfish, shrimp, crab, lobster. You can basically get a bag of steamed crab, shrimp, and sausage with corn. Something like a Joes Crab Shack. Not your traditional Vietnamese restaurant, which puts this place at the top of my list. They also have pho and a few other Vietnamese dishes.   I decided to get the Bun(My Favorite) with shrimp And Pork.... They skimped on the shrimp big time! It was mostly pork with two pieces of shrimp....Wtf. Either way I loved the food. I also ordered fried spring rolls, and prawns.   Overall I plan to come back here, this place is awesome",

I am not a huge pho fan, but my coworkers and friends really like them here. I tend to go for the vermicelli bowls (shrimp is my favorite) or the roasted chicken with sticky rice. Everything is always hot and is served quickly. As other reviewers have stated, this place is not going to win any points for ambiance.There is an empty lobster tank with a sponge in it right in front of the desk, their soda fountain is broken but still taking up an entire corner of the restaurant, and they keep their washable chopsticks in containers (exposed) in the middle of their tables. And there is typically only one waiter during lunch. BUT, the food is really consistent and good, and this area in general needs less chain restaurants and more local dives.",

However... The pho was delicious here - The meat was thin and great! My only complaint about my soup was that the meat must have been so thin, it disappeared!!! I only had about 4 pieces of meat in my soup. But what I had was good.  We also ordered a pound of shrimp, house sauce, medium spice. It was good! They had a different flavoring than what I'm used to, but it was really delicious! Good sized shrimp, easy to peel, and good taste.  Now, the service. If you're coming here for good service and wanting to be waited on well, don't come. But if you want seafood or pho then go.  First strike was when our server was picking something out of the water cup with the straw with no gloves and hands on the actual straw. And then brought us the cup that he picked stuff out of.... Gross.  Once we ordered, I asked him to bring the shrimp first, THEN the soup. He said sure, and then brought the soup and shrimp at the same time, and didn't bring us anything we needed for the soup or the shrimp.  Either way, I may come back. Just I'll be prepared for the mediocre service that comes with it!",

You can really tell that everything is made to order (even the summer rolls, which many Vietnamese restaurants make ahead of time.)   The service is fast. The place is clean and well kept.   The pho broth is the best quality broth in the Charlotte region, hands down. It is not at all oily and it is extremely flavorful. It probably comes from the fact that they definitely use quality ingredients and make it fresh each day.  The summer rolls are so fresh that the rice paper is still sticky (not dry like at some places that make it ahead.)   Despite their dedication to freshness, they have no increase in their prices over any other Pho place I've been to.  We will be back again and again and again.",

We had a large group come to eat, was blessed by a friend who wanted to pay for everyone so he did discreetly while we were all in the middle of our meal. At the end of dinner, the waitress brought the check(again) to a different person who wanted to pay (he didn't know the bill was already paid).   Our table was charged twice. Both checks were of different amount. Either an employee is pocketing money or this is how they want their business carry out. Their receipt isn't itemized so you don't know what you're being charged for exactly.   We won't be back even though some entrees are really good. VISITING PATRONS BEWARE!",

I love the Gamecocks but the color scheme of garnet, red, black, beige tile, knotty pine, and red wood doesn't represent the quality of this place. I wish Gordon Ramsey could come in and beautify it! The food and staff are both wonderful so the only thing holding this place back is the interior.  On to the good stuff! I've been there about 3 or 4 times now. The first time I ordered the red curry with chicken and it was the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. My family all ordered pho and it was good. They all really enjoyed it. My son ordered the red curry the next visit after tasting mine!  The spring rolls are very good.   I've tried ordering red curry after this place and nothing has held a candle to this place. My expectations are now too high. We've only visited at lunch. I think because of the location and ambiance, it doesn't come to mind as a \"dinner place\", but I think we need to give it a try. I know our bellies would be happy!",

She made sure that we had what we needed, she even provided us with to go menus for the next time we ordered.   I helped my mom with her order as it was her first time experiencing Pho. She and my dad truly enjoyed it and said they will be back. They loved the broth and the mixture of flavors once they dressed up their pho.

They have a decent selection of other Asian dishes but we were here for the pho.  Sadly, I don't remember the specific dish that I had but it was their \"extra large\" sized bowl with thinly sliced beef, a big knot of noodles and all the usual fixings for pho such as bean sprouts, fresh basil, a few rings of jalapenos and a wedge of lime. The display on the table included the usual sriracha and hoisin sauces plus wrapped chopsticks and the soup spoons for eating.  The soup was hot, delicious and definitely hit the spot. Rich broth, lots of meat, lots of noodles. Extra large is definitely the way to go if you're looking for something big enough to swim in.  Yes, they'll make it keto-friendly by skipping the noodles and adding extra vegetables. That was awesome to see.",

These were super fresh and delicious, the peanut sauce that accompanied them was great. Followed that with a small (they have small, large and x-large), since I just powered down three summer rolls.

They were accommodating and allowed us to substitute the crawfish for more shrimp. We got the house special sauce which to me was like a tamarind base. We got the medium spicy and that was pretty spicy to me but I can't do spicy like that. The food was steaming hot. You used to get a bucket to put your shells in but I guess they don't do that anymore so we discarded them on the white construction paper that they had laid down on the table. It's a nice little place to go and enjoy some seafood or pho. When we were cashing out we were told that the place had been sold. Sad to see the original owners go but I hope the new management keeps up or makes it better in their own way. Will definitely check them out to see how the new management goes.",

It's basically a one man show once you come inside.   When we entered it was the lunch rush and all of the empty tables were dirty with dishes. The server/hostess/busboy tried to seat us at a table he had cleared but was connected to another table that was dirty. I told him no rush and that we would wait for him to empty/clean the other table.   I ordered the #10 Pho Tai Bo Vien (rare beef and meatball) and my mom ordered the #7 Pho Tai, Nam (rare and flank steak). My mother also has to try the chicken wings at every Asian restaurant so she ordered the appetizer chicken wings. The server told us the only difference between the spicy and the Cajun wings were the Cajun wings are saltier and the spicy wings have cayenne pepper sprinkled on them. We opted for the spicy wings. When they arrived it wasn't what we were expecting. We got 5 crispy fried wings and a side of ketchup. They were just a bit spicy when you got a taste of the cayenne pepper.   Next was our pho. We both chose the XL bowl because we wanted to share with my niece and nephew. The server brought out the veggies that you add to your Pho, normally lemons, jalapenos, bean sprouts and basil. Our plate was missing the basil. I looked around and some of the dirty tables still had basil sprigs lingering around so I thought it was just a mistake and our server forgot. When I asked for the basil I was informed that they had run out! Yikes!!! To tell the truth and not to seem like a pho snob but I was very disappointed when I found out there was no basil! It makes the pho so much tastier!!!  The flank steak in my mom's soup was very good! I would much rather have that than the rare beef.  Even after sharing our bowls we both still had a large amount to take home with us.   As we were paying I overheard another customer asked for the Korean BBQ and he was told they were out. Not sure what the deal is with them running out of things isn't cool.   All in all this was my second visit here and I'm not so sure if I'm coming back anytime soon. If I do it will be to have the FLANK STEAK in my pho!!!",

They always give you ample pieces of me and this time was no different. It was delicious as usual. I can't wait for my next visit!",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem. The pho is really good. Be careful though, their jalapeno peppers are really spicy but add a really good kick to the pho. The small pho is pretty big. They give you alot of broth and alot of meat and noodles. The resturant is clean and even though they appeared to only have one waiter tonight, he was pretty cool.",

    "text": "Good stuff. Went for lunch. Bowl of pho and summer rolls. Pho broth was excellent. Clear and had great flavor, maybe a little light on the condiments. Very clean establishment. Good service. Came quickly. My only issue would be that it was too clean. Pho joints should have an edge to them.",

    "text": "Finally I try there pho last week. The pho is really good. But, if I have a choice I don't want the guy to give me a service. I came in last week two guy were working. I think they like to play on the phone more than giving customer services. Last time I came the girl working there giving me a great customer service. I think the owner have to tell the guys how to be a great customer services. They do bring me everything. Like water, vegetables, after that they go to the cashier on the phone, when I try to raise my hand for the check no one looking at. They looking down. I think I will Came back and try there new item.",

    "text": "Really excellent meal. Was worried after reading some of the reviews, but they have definitely improved. Any delay in speed of food was explained by how fresh the items arrived at the table. Fresh summer rolls were made to order and served with a warm peanut sauce which was a nice twist. Both had Pho, one with Beef and they made mine to order with vegetables. Although you pay extra for vegetables, $2 up charge was worth it. Our server Melinda was super friendly and efficient. When we were done and needed to take our leftovers, she made sure to bring us a bag so we could put the container in it so it wouldn't leak in the car.",
