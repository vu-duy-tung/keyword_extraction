The waiter was pushy and kept asking the kids to be quiet, while he was taking the order.As soon as we sat down, went and pushed the Japanese Whisky, if we ask for recommendation than suggest. He kept pushing one of the ladies in the group to buy a drink 4-5 times. Lastly the food was ordinary this time, appetizers were okay but the curry fried rice was disappointing. When you charge 18% gratuity, you better provide the service. I did enjoy the green mango drink.",

Once we got the menus, it took him a while to come back and take our order, including our drinks. I ordered the Hong Kong chicken and my boyfriend ordered the lamb bulgogi. His order came out wrong. They brought him the lamb hot garlic. No one ever came back to check on us, and we were hungry, so we ended up eating what we could. My Hong Kong chicken was very disappointing. The texture of the chicken (minced) was very rubbery. I am usually not a picky eater, but I couldn't bring myself to take more than 2 bites. The manager did offer us 25% off our ticket, which was a nice gesture. But unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning anymore.",

The appetizers was good and we ordered the main course as well as the desserts well in advance before their kitchen closing time. After waiting for close to 15-20 mins, the desserts came out without the entrees. Finally when the food arrived it was tasteless. Now, I went again yesterday to give them a second chance to prove themselves. The soup came in after the appetizers. We ordered chilly chicken and it was so hot that after one bite, my mouth kind a got burned. The manager was saying that since it's chilly chicken it will be hot but it should not be too hot like insanity. Horrible food and service. Not recommended at all.",

    "text": "This was my first experience with this chain and I'm sorry to say it was not a good one. The food was okay, the waitstaff alright, but overall I felt very uncomfortable eating here. The managers were hovering most of the time. I'm not sure if they were trying to help the one girl waiting tables out, or if they were just making it harder for her. But we were approached by three different managers during our visit for various reasons. They all spoke very quietly so I could barely hear them, even though the restaurant itself was not busy and was very quiet. I can see why a new restaurant like this was so quiet at dinner time on a Saturday.   I ordered szcheuan shrimp, which is fairly spicy, so I didn't notice at first that my food wasn't hot temperature wise. It was still edible and I was starving, so I ate it. I also wasn't expecting the shrimp to be fried and it was pretty disappointing that they were. This is because the Szcheuan sauce was very soupy, so the batter soaked it up and made the shrimp soggy. They were also too big to put in your mouth and no knives were provided. I ended up getting sauce on my white shirt because the shrimp were hard to maneuver. The sauce itself basically tasted like the brown sauce you'd typically find at a Chinese place, but with extra chili oil in it. So, not great for $18.   I also ordered the fruit cocktail sundae, which was also alright, but not worth $5. The sundae was made of very cheap vanilla ice cream, cheap canned fruit cocktail (so cheap there weren't even cherries in it), and yellow cake that tasted more like a corn muffin than cake.   The waitstaff was competent, but would disappear for long periods of time. Luckily, they serve their water in a stoppered bottle so you can pour it yourself so I didn't have to wait to have my water glass refilled until the bottle was empty. However, because it was in a bottle, it was not at all cold. They apparently haven't heard of ice either unless you order soda or tea (cool thing to note: they use paper straws!).   Back to the waitstaff, the managers kept approaching to ask if things were alright and how the food was (would have been totally fine with that if not for the fact the waitress had done the same thing not two minutes prior). It was like the managers were trying to do the waiters' job and then didn't inform them they were doing so, as a manager took our payment and returned our card, and then the waitress came by a moment later to do the same. I also had a plate of finished food sitting in front of me for the duration of my dessert because the waitress decided to leave it after she put my dessert down. Did I neglect to mention our waitress also didn't know what was in the food?  Overall, this place is not only too expensive for the area, it's also just not good at all. 0/10 do not recommend.",

Every dish they are preparing has that bitter taste of MSG and overwhelming high sodium soy sauce I will never go to this place ever and don't recommend to anyone. If you want to stay healthy definitely stay away. They should be shut down because of there food preparation. If you guys don't believe then do random tests on there dishes.",

The chicken was was really good however it was a little too spicy and I actually like spicy food. So beware if you are not into spicy foods. I also had the spring rolls which were really good. Definitely will return but will try to order something a little less spicy.",

Second, I think it was awesome that this place provided the community with free lunch on opening day! This was a great way to show appreciation for future clientele!   I made sure to take advantage of this free lunch, and I was not disappointed. I had the Beef Mongolian and it was great. It was served with a healthy portion of fried rice and a side \"salad\" which was actually kimchi! All in all, the dish had a great flavor profile, and was enhanced by the different sauces they had table side.   I didn't get a chance to look at their full menu, but I must say I have high expectations now! The ambiance is really cool. Very intimate and romantic. Also, I love their decorations that pay homage to Buddhism.  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This is the best Indian Pakistani Chinese food restaurant. Very fine setting, high quality ingredients, great ambiance and a perfect blend of quality and service. I'm really not understanding why half the people are complaining about the spice level because they literally ask you to give a spicy level between 1-10. Guys expect to get spicy food if you come to an Asian restaurant. As far as the service, I'm shocked at some of the reviews about the creepy servers. All the servers and the long hair pony tailed manager Clinton are probably the best in the entire food industry, extremely personable and go above and beyond to help. Mistakes happen with everyone and when there was the occasional soup flavor mixup they gave us the extra soups for no charge. The staff knows us on a first name basis and goes out of the way to promptly help all customers. This is a place where you can proudly take your wife, in-laws, coworkers and executives (done all that and received raving positive reviews, every single person was impressed). The ambiance, service, high quality you will get here is unmatched in any indo pak or any other restaurant. We are so blessed to have this restaurant in Charlotte and could not be more appreciative. If any of you have any questions please message me. I'm usually not the one to write a ton of reviews, I wish I could give 10 stars out of 5. This is the restaurant I proudly celebrate all our birthdays, anniversaries and major life milestones. Beats PF Chang's, Bone Fish Grill etc..btw the deserts are world class, and the food is just as great, and they are so caring and don't hesitate to go above and beyond to ensure you are satisfied.",

This is a new place so all the decor looks very modern and fresh. I hope it stays that way even after years to come.   My friend is a big fan of this place so as we get here, he is being treated as a royalty. We get to pick where we want to seat, our favorite waiter who knows their stuff not just a pretty face and the manager came to greet us and check on us few times while we were here. Now that's called personal attention to their customers.   We started our order with drinks and they were able to bring it right away. While we were catching up, my friend ordered some food which arrived in short time. The food tasted good but the sweet and spicy sauce made it even better for my taste.   We really enjoyed our visit here with their excellent service, great food and personal attention to details on our request for special drinks and food (spicy). We will definitely come here often.",

The food is just as good if not better than the other location. They have really good lunch specials. I had the chicken manchurian with chicken fried rice and Hakka noodles. Lunch specials come with a spring roll, soup and kimchi. My husband had the garlic paneer. I also ordered a mango mojito (non-alcoholic) and we shared the darsaan dessert (fried noodles with sesame and honey and vanilla ice cream. I wasn't too crazy about the drink but everything else was top notch! The drinks looked phenomenal but since we went here for lunch during work hours, I decided to pass on the alcohol. But I will be having some tonight if we go again. The other location has crispy chili baby corn which I didn't think to look up but if you see it on the mit's a must-have.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and was very well presented. Service was great and the decor is very tastefully done. They have ample parking.  I am SO stoked to see this place finally open (the signs have been up since summer). Can't wait to go here again this weekend. Maybe I'll make this a weekly thing?",

This seemed rather suspicious to me and I certainly was not entertaining the idea of a quick return trip there.  Big turn off!

Forged by the spices and stories of Chinese immigrants to India over many centuries, this cuisine is unique and unlike any other.    If you have tasted the best Indo Chinese east of the Atlantic, you know that Inchin Bamboo Garden is the best west of the pond.   Their food used to be 3 or 4 at best.  They have upped the game to a solid 5/5.  Hope they keep it up.   Note - spice level is high.  Medium is equivalent to hot elsewhere.  We stick with mild.",

The wait staff even asked how the food was & I had hesitation to say but the food was horrible & after getting the review the wait staff brings the check with no apology. That was the 1st & last experience of this place. Please don't wade your money here rathe go to any other Chinese Restaurent which are much tastier & the services are good.",

The fried rice and noodles weren't that good I could get better from a take out place for WAY cheaper, the chili paneer was pretty good but there just wasn't enough for four people and same with the paneer tacos they were so good but you get 3 and they're so small!! It's honestly not worth the price you pay for the food. Might as well go to a takeout place and save your money!",

Perfect ambiance for  a large dinner party . The menu had a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. I tried several appetizers , main courses and dessert . Everything was delicious and   flavorful. The manchow soup was full of fresh herbs , can't wait to enjoy it on an upcoming cold night. The five spice lamb was served super cute on a grill platter with candles , definitely instagram worthy . We ended the meal with some green tea , and date wontons , A very delicious twist on a crab rangoon style dessert .  Where the filing is  a date mixture instead of cream cheese .  Definitely a go to spot for your next lunch or dinner  outing .",

The place looks closed until you get right up to the door, and both visits very few patrons.  Better signage would help, I'm sure.  We both ordered the Szechuan Lamb which comes with soup, choice of rice, and a bowl of lamb stew.  While it was spicy as advertised, I thought the flavors were muddled, caught in the culinary confluence somewhere between India and China, hence their name.  Corn soup was poorly conceived and was bland, and thick like paste.  Pass.  We also shared their Thai Asian salad which was very good.  It included chicken which we learned at checkout was a $2 up charge even though we did not request it.  Bummer.  I think if you're into their Indo-China concept you may like it.   If so, give 'em a whirl.",

Then we had garlic chilli noodles and Gobi manchurian with fried rice (which was really good. It was not that spicy as I imagined but it was good. Overall I was satisfied by the food.  UPDATE 02/27/2019  Menu: Every time I come here, the food and service is worse than previous time. (This visit was my 5th one) First of all their menu changes every time I go there. This time I went and ordered Dumplings and they served half the quantity they used to serve and they said they've updated the way they serve food.  Food: Food was just not good it was bland and had less salt. All Asian fusions have an option of giving fried rice for some extra bucks but Here there is No such option and we have to get an entire entree of Fried rice.  Service: There were 2 of us and we ordered 2 soups. They served us only one and after 15 minutes served another. The place was 15% filled yet no one was there to follow up. We had to go to the bar just to ask for basic things such as salt and pepper.",

Our waiter however, I'm not sure if he is 1)High? 2) Tired? Or 3) Just Rude ?  Or all of the above but his attitude from jump has been quite unpleasant. Very dry and rude not very welcoming. My husband was ordering his food and in the middle of asking if he could substitute white rice for brown but , before he could even get his words out the waiter was talking over him saying \"We do not substitute\".  Idk despite the crappy customer service reviews we decided to try this place anyway but yeah na we are good won't be returning here.  The inside is pretty but the food is a NO , the customer service is a NO NO and the prices is a NO NO NO!  Update: Maybe the waiter saw me typing this review because he asked if everything was good and I politely told him no. He then brought us a brownie and ice cream \"on the house\" well thank you sir it was good and I appreciate it but I still will not be returning",

I have dines in during both lunch and dinner and found the food taste to be inconsistent which I am not a fan of. The menu is huge and in my two visits thus far, I have tired Paneer Latmai, chilli paneer, hakka noodles, Manchurian, burnt garlic fried rice and dimsums. My all time favorite is burnt garlic fried rice. I will visit again to satisfy my cravings for indian Chinese food",

Came here with friends, it's always a good sign when an Asian restaurant is full of brown people! For starters had the momo. They are more like pot stickers but good nonetheless. Have them with the momo sauce, nice and spicy! The chili paneer- oh how I have been craving this! It was delicious! Had some bird's eye chillies in it that were hot and so good with the paneer! We then had the manchow soup, which was very different but in a good way! For entrees we had the general tso's chicken - I found it kinda sweet but was flavorful Mongolian lamb was a bit tough but nicely spiced. Cumin lamb was delicious! It's new on the menu. I've missed having it! We also tried the crispy chicken chili honey - I liked it way more than the general tso's! I also had the Desi mango drink - with black salt, was pretty good!  I was kinda disappointed with their dessert options! I expected some desi desserts but nope!  All in all I loved it and am looking forward to coming here again!",

Great ambiance with tasty food and wonderful staff makes it my to-go spot. My personal favorites are the soups, street side chow mein , chicken 65 fried rice and the garlic pepper chicken.",

Noodle bhel is a must try. It's almost like the bhel served in India except for the fact that in India it's served with puff rice and here they are crispy fried noodles. I always have the paneer starter which is coated in loads of spicy and is just mouth watering. Reminds me of the taste in India. Egg chowmein is my husband's all time favorite and trust me it's the street style chowmein of India and the best dish in the menu. I had tried spicy egg plant stir fry and I swear it was the best egg plant dish I ever had with loads of garlic and juicy egg plants. My husband's friend from NYC joined us for dinner here while visiting Bellevue and he loved the Indo Chinese food here too. If you are missing the Indo Chinese Indian food then you must visit this place for sure!",
