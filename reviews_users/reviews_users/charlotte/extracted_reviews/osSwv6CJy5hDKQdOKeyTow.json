    "text": "This place feels like a diner that serves sushi.  Which is a really cool vibe, don't get me wrong.  The simple, cheap tables and decor probably just let them keep the prices rock bottom (which they are).  The quality of the lunch buffet fits this analogy perfectly too.  It is like Going to Old Country Buffet and shelling out ten bucks to have all the mediocre but incredibly varietous sushi you would like.  The spread really is incredible. From the sushi to the side dishes to the desserts (which are pretty crummy), I often find myself wandering aimlessly from table to table processing a fierce internal argument about what should-or shouldnt-go on my plate.  This is probably why I made it back to home base with a gigantic mound of sushi and rice.  Not to say Rusan'sis bad or good, it's a unique, $10 sushi experience.  Lots of variety, little flavor, and a unique atmosphere (for a sushi place).  It's also a zoo around lunch time, so they must be doing something right.  I only give this place two stars but I have been twice and would certainly go again if someone invited me.  It's just not that good compared to all the other sushi options I have experienced in Charlotte.  In this case at least, you get what you pay for.  So go ahead and grab as much of it as you can.",

I would recommend against it even though it's a good deal because it includes alot of sashimi that most people are afraid of eating (e.g. Uni - looks like poo, Octopus - has tentacles, Shrimp heads - self-explanatory...)  Snow White Roll - YUM  Sushi Tart - butter on top of sushi? Excellent idea. Hard to share, but delicious.  Steak Roll (special) - Good for the unadventurous.   Kobe Steak Appetizer - Good steak, the sauce was a little too sweet for me.  Salmon Sashimi, Rich and Famous, Yellow Tail - Always a winner  Tuna Poke, Tuna Sashimi - Always kinda... meh.  3 egg sushi - WHOA, too overwhelming. Could only eat 1.  And they also have half off bottles of wine during Happy Hour!",

My second thought should have been ' or must be cheap'. .  I think this buffet caters to people that like quantity over quality. Given my Asain background, I suppose I am somewhat of a  sushi snob. The sushi rolls just have drizzled sauces..making them 'look pretty' without the taste. Was NOT quality rolls. I was sorely dissapointed..  Also, anyone that does not consume raw fish will be dissapointed as well (as my companion to lunch had a difficult time eating well)..Thier hot plate selection was subpar and limited... I would have even prefered a typical chinese buffet to this.   The other main point is that the customer service was poor. Hostess was short with everyone. The place was soo packed, like sardines and only 2 small buffet tables for all of these people..I felt like a vulture, having to eye my prey of food and grab it before someone else did...It was seriously that packed/overcrowded and stressful.   No thank you...I willl prefer to pay double the price for a relaxing, quality meal.",

The place was packed but we got a seat right away at the bar. Huge selection of sushi. Friendly staff. I tried the Chipotle roll. Nice little kick and very tasty. Wasn't as big of a fan of the Rich and Famous roll. My daughter enjoyed her veggie rolls too. It's a little loud in there especially when the chefs start banging their knives on the counter. Not sure what that's about but it was interesting none the less. Glad this place is so close, I'll be back for sure.",

They are slow, they never refill your glass...its just bad.   The food on the other hand is great! I love their $1.50 sushi. It has a fun atmosphere and room for larger parties in the back. But if you do have a large party.. sometimes it may mean you'll be waiting for an hour for food. At least thats my experience with 2 birthday celebrations there.   If the service was quicker I'd give this place five stars, but that poor service kills it.",

Although the wait for s table on Saturday night was close to half an hour and akin to waiting to get into a club, the impressive menu, super friendly staff, and phenomenal food was well worth the wait. The sake selection is impressive, as are Ru San's specialty rolls. For those who enjoy nigiri, an equally impressive selection is available, at a reasonable price, and is very high quality. Pricing is actually less expensive than many \"wannabe\" sushi places. I'd give Ru San's five stars if they could work out their wait list and waiting area issues.",

The staff were very much sports fans and would celebrate when a good play was made.  The portions were large and the sushi pieces and rolls were inexpensive. The menu is slightly overwhelming because of all they offer. The service was good, the selection was plentiful, but the quality of the food was lacking (I guess you get what you pay for.)  The restaurant itself was big, open, and bright. The music was loud and seemed a bit \"club-esce.\" It would be great if the place was packed, but it seemed a bit off when there were only 3-4 tables filled and it was daytime.   Not bad for something quick, but definitely not a place I crave. And as you leave, all the chefs say goodbye too. I think the greeting and the salutation was awesome.",

    "text": "Ru San's tends to be our go-to for a last minute meal plan.  The quality of the sushi, while not the best in town, is always solid and doesn't kill your wallet.  I'm always a sucker for the Sinking Titanic Hidden Treasure roll because there is always the chance that the bowl may contain the token that represents a $10 gift card.  I've yet to ever discover the hidden treasure, but I keep on trying.   Along with the $1 menu, the lunch buffet seems to be the draw for most people.  I've only tried the buffet here once and doubt that I'll rush back again.  The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.  What is wrong with people?  I imagined them texting the friend right behind them since nobody actually has real conversation any more.  And then when these chronic texters take the last of the tuna tartare?!?  Seriously? If you can't navigate a buffet line like a pro, you don't deserve the tuna tartare.  So let it be written, so let it be done.    If you want sushi that is of consistent quality at a decent price, Ru San's is for you.  If you want a quiet date, it is not.  There is a lot of yelling.  Kind of like Moe's--but Japanese.",

I love sushi, I remember a time when I thought raw fish was the worst thing on earth but now I embrace it and can't get enough.  I have been here for a normal meal and the sushi is always fresh and very reasonable.  But you MUST go for the lunch buffet!  Here's the deal:  Everyday at lunch from 11am to 2pm I think there is an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi buffet.  They are making it fresh all the time and keep bringing out plates and plates of it for you to devour.  Also included is a small buffet of hot asian foods like egg rolls, lo mein, fried rice, calamari and some other items.  There's also dessert.  All this for....$10!    I know what you're thinking, the sushi has to be bad, the fish is old, I'm gonna get sick!  But no, it's fresh, and delicious and many times on Saturday afternoon after a rough Friday night I've found myself there with my husband eating WAY too much and heading home for a nap.  Try it out, I doubt you will be disappointed!",

    "text": "Practically an institution, I've been to Ru-San's at least a dozen times, always for lunch. The self-serve buffet of sushi isn't the absolute best quality, but there are usually a few good finds. They usually have salmon or tuna sushi as well as several of their creative and innovative rolls. At least half are fried, which is always an interesting option. This is, after all, the South. :-)  You can easily avoid the fried stuff and focus on the raw fish. Plenty of options, even on the slower days, the stuff doesn't sit out there for long. On the back table (you didn't know there were two?) are usually a steam tray with lo mein and egg rolls and sometimes fried chicken drumsticks and wings. I've spotted big trays of tuna and salmon sashimi there on occasion.  You can't beat the price. $10 with water or $12 if you get a soda. That's a deal and a half!  I love it. One of these days, I'll have to return for dinner.",

    "text": "I waited a while to write this review, so that I could at least try it more than once before giving my opinion.  Many people rave about Ru San, but I'm afraid I don't share the same enthusiasm about this place.  I think if you go in with the mindset of having some fun non-traditional sushi and having lots of alcohol,  you'll have a good time.  For me, I think I can appreciate semi-Americanized sushi, specialty rolls, etc. but Ru-San's didn't quite hit the mark.  I do enjoy the concept of their $1 sushi menu, buried within their vast menu; it's a great way to get a feel for their style, sort of tapas style.  Their Ceviche is good as is their Rock and Roll (or something like that).  I love that it's cheap, small portions, and kind of no-commitment (if you don't like it, hey it was only a buck).  The teriyaki rice ball is a crispy rice ball with rich teriyaki sauce and is pretty tasty, more in an appetizer/dessert sort of way.  If you veer off the $1 items, Ru-San's falls short.  While I respect that someone said the Firecracker Roll is \"delicious like a donut,\" that is only True if donuts taste like a$$ (I say this not to be mean, but purely to make a point).  I have to warn the rest of you.  I love donuts, but I did not love the Firecracker Roll.  It is deep fried where the fish becomes tasteless and then they douse it in red chili sauce that is absolutely overpowering, unappetizing looking and I am reduced to a one-syllable adjective - yuck.  Sometimes a child's vocabulary describes it best.  It's not the heat, (there wasn't much heat) it's the taste that turned me off.  It's like they took a good steak, cooked it well-done and slathered it in A1 steak sauce.  I wanted to rinse my mouth out with sake.  I just don't get the appeal of the Firecracker Roll.    Unlike the others, I thought the service was good.  No complaints from me on that front.    I think it's a fine place for a non-traditional sushi lover, but I'm not a fan.",

My server finally makes it back and ask did I want them to make my food over since it was sitting on the counter for so long...ugh talk about irritated. I waited 35 minutes for a table and now wait another 20 to 30 minutes for my food again...I opted out.   Worst service ever!!!",

I mentioned to the waiter twice about it thinking maybe an acknowledgement by the establishment would bring a cheer or a candle on one of the birthday boy's sushi. Nada.   Fortunately the jittery waiter seemed eager to please which diffused chuckles around the table.   Our birthday boy ordered the Sushi & Assorted Sashimi dinner which the waiter  mistakenly ordered the Assorted Sashimi Dinner only.  Two ordered the Tekka Don which tuna sashimi was cut very very thinly on top of mounds of rice.   How can you taste the fishiness with it being so paper thin? We could see the rice through the sashimi!!!   No pro sushi or experienced Japanese cuisine chef there last night. Many foreign \"workers\" behind the sushi bar...sure they will verbally welcome you and thank you for being patrons which is a fun thing BUT if you're paying $$$, not $$, you should expect what you pay for, right? A well run sushi bar doesn't need ten+ guys. That's where my full slices of Tekka Don tuna went...to their paychecks and not to my tummy.   Granted, the mounds of quality sushi rice was perfectly cooked and prepared but we didn't go there just for the rice! We had a birthday boy and a visiting sister from Seattle...how disappointing. Zannen zannen!   Hopefully Ru-San will read this and re-evaluate. Please take this seriously for your business' sake.",

    "text": "COOL spot if your looking for some great sushi after hours! I have spent plenty of nights here sobering up. Somewhere between the hours of 10 and 12 O'clock at night. I have also spent more money here than I have at the bars (haha).   Obviously, my favorite thing about Ru San's is that they stay open pretty late on most nights. It is one thing to find a place open during these hours, but even more difficult to find SUSHI at this time! They have really saved me from settling for Harris Teeter's two day old sushi.   In my opinion, their sushi is absolutely fantastic! It is probably some of the best sushi I have ever had. It is one of those sushi restaurants where you can enjoy the raw stuff, because you KNOW that the fish is fresh. Far too many times have I eaten at a lower quality joint, where I couldn't order raw fish because it wasn't fresh.  It is not just the food that is great, but the service is always on point. There has not been a time yet that I have had an empty cup. This is important to me, as I tend to go through at least a gallon of water when I go out to eat (especially after drinking). The creativity that is put into every dish is very unique. This brings me to the downside as it can get very pricey. Also, make sure if your ordering from the \"special roll\" menu, to ask if it is actually a sushi roll or an entree. I have ordered a roll from this menu once, and when my food came out It was definitely not sushi. It was just a regular entree with some rice..I was very confused.   I highly recommend this place If you are looking for sushi any time of the day/night. I think you will enjoy your visit as I always do. Two thumbs up for high quality fish!",

However, I have made the pilgrimage from my office in Pineville more times than I like to admit to take part in the great sushi gathering. All in all, the overall experience is always a positive one. It is always busy, but the staff always does a good job with drinks and turning tables to handle a mounting crowd. The advantage of not having the sushi made to order is you can get in and out with a sizable crowd in a decent amount of time. Also it allows you to try a lot of different sushi pieces. I will say that it is difficult at times to know what you are eating as nothing is labeled. Also many of the rolls tend to be simple or are deep fried. In the end, you can always expect decent sushi in high volumes for lunch. Also try to show up early to avoid a wait.",

We've been coming pretty much once a week and never grow tired of it.  For the price, the sushi is great.  We can pig out here for $30 and when we order an equivalent meal at a different sushi place end up spending $60.    The Firecracker Roll is my favorite, but I also like to sample around the menu and try to get something new every time I go.  I also love the crab cake and grilled teriyaki ball.  Their miso soup has such good flavor and they use noodles rather than tofu.    This is my daughter's favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  When I asked her how many stars to give, she said 5 stars because the food is so good.  When a 9-year-old says a place is a 5-star place then you know it's good, right?",

The menu is extensive with sushi options as well as japanese dinner specialties.  I am always craving something spicy and the firecracker roll is one of my favorites.  Also the Firecracker shrimp appetizer is great as well.  I've found the wait staff to be hit or miss but the sushi chefs are friendly.     There are two flaws here.  One it's two loud an two, I think they are a bit pricy.  But the food is wonderful.  I think I found my regular sushi place.",

The shrimp was juicy, the sauce was spicy, and the onions and avocado gave it a fresh clean taste. I loved it! If you like spicy shrimp this is definitely worth a try!

    "text": "A co-worker of mine has been raving about Ru Sans for a YEAR and I just checked it out last night for dinner.  I'm Asian, and feel as though I can say this: finally, a sushi joint that reminds me of the ones I've been to on the West Coast.  Loud, not too expensive, full of fun sushi, noodles, yakitori...and other Asian people.  That's a good sign.   The sushi is FUN.  The menu is huge, and usually I'm weary of enormous menus, but you can see how high-volume the restaurant is, and you can tell the sushi is fresh and constantly made. You'll get lots of deep fried rolls, and cream cheese laden ones, yes, but along with it, you'll find vegetarian rolls with nice accents like mint, or strawberry.   Keep in mind, the sushi bar serves faster than the kitchen, so we got our sushi first, then our appetizers.   The yakitori and tempura menu is cheap, and was just OK.  I didn't mind because it was only $1. The tempura didn't have enough panko crumbs, it was too batter laden and thick, but still I thought it was yummy.  (Think, Asian inspired bar food!) The yakitori didn't really have much grill taste...I don't think it was prepared on a robata, which is fine, but I don't think I'll order it again.   The house salad was typical, but the ginger carrot dressing they use here, my favorite!  Sweet and tangy, creamy and fresh.   Dessert was 50/50. The fried banana with caramel sauce and ice cream was delicious.  The wrapper, thicker than usual preparations, but gave the dish a nice crunch.   The cream puffs, I'm pretty sure were one frozen from a box.  (I might have bought them at Costco at one point!)   But again, if the people weren't so nice, the ambiance so boisterous (sushi artists yelling our in Japanese, or whistling) I may have given Ru Sans fewer stars.  But the service was good, the environment fun and casual, the sushi is cheap and yummy.    Can't wait to try the $10.10 lunch buffet!  PS:  Has anybody gotten that roll on the menu (sorry forgot what it's called) where you can win a $10 gift card by finding a treasure inside it???",

The special rolls are always interesting and usually tasty for the safe and daring  sushi eater alike.  I had the seven samurai last night that tested my chopstick dexterity with a sticky rice wrap, but it was satisfying when I finally got it into my grill.  They have some beer (guh, Budweiser) specials that weren't bad, but I stick with wine by the bottle.  A LITTLE lofty on the pricing that way, but it is standard for restaurant mark up.  Note: fun atmosphere can quickly translate into \"am I old, or is it loud in here?!\" when someone does a saki bomb and the chefs all bang on the stainless steel counters.  All in all, an old stand by for a cheap sushi first date.",

Different but not bad in any way. The bacon wrapped scallop yakitori is damn good. Will most definitely come back in the future.",

    "text": "Thrice have I now indulged in the wonderful lunch buffet that is Ru San's.  Each time I've gone, I have loved it more than the last.  For $9.99 at lunch time, you can eat as much of their tasty sushi as you like.  On the buffet, they usually have about 12 or so different types of maki rolls that you can eat.  On the other table, they have sushi, delicious fried calamari, stir-fry, desserts, and other little appetizers and salads, in case you get sick of just eating maki rolls.  They keep rotating out different kinds of rolls throughout the lunch period.  I was surprised on how many different types of rolls they put out.    Yes, it is pretty much always busy here at lunch time.  Yes, you have to buy individual cans or bottles of drinks (particularly soda and beer).  It can get pretty noisy with all the people, and sometimes it gets a little difficult to get into the buffet lines.  I can never figure out which direction you're supposed to go, which is mildly chaotic.  Even when they first open, there's often a line outside the door waiting to get in.  Sometimes, when it's really busy, you have to wait a few minutes before the servers come so you can pay your tab.  If you don't mind that, this place is delicious, fast, and pretty cheap for a sushi lunch.  That being said, I've never been to dinner, so I can't speak as to that aspect.  At lunch time the servers basically just clear plates, which I've never had a problem with.",

At the bar seat, you can see all the fish that the chefs are working with and it's awesome. I ordered a rainbow roll and he order some chicken udon noodle soup. My rainbow roll was personally handed to me by the chef that made it, which was awesome. Later, my boyfriend and I split the tootsie roll! It was delicious and the eel sauce was awesome.   This is a great place to have a date or just a nice sushi meal to yourself. The goldfish neon lighting above the bar gives it a good aesthetic.

The sushi was a fresh, unique, and delicious as I've been told. We had several rolls for the table to share and each one was better than the last.

If you are not a sushi fiend like me you can regale your appetite with your typical chinese cooked buffet, fried rice, noodles, sweet and sour chicken and more at the other buffet island or order a la carte.

My Yelp comrades were not lying, the place opens at 11:30 by 11:50 the place was packed. First thing that rubbed me the wrong way, the hostess had an attitude. She tried to sit me at the bar, I requested I be placed at a small table instead. However, before she would let me finish my request she quips I can't have a booth as I am a party of one. Ok...great...if you would let me finish my sentence you would know I wasn't requesting a booth (I get y'all get packed and need the seats). Strike 1.   Strike 2... the layout of the place is awful for a sushi buffet I mean people were crashing into each other trying to get around to the sushi or their respective tables. I'm sure they can figure out how to reorganize the interior to make it a bit more logical in terms of the layout. I found it very stressful to navigate around servers, staff, and guests.   Strike 3...the sushi pretty much was awful. There were no labels telling you what type of fish was in each roll. Many of the rolls were deep fried and filled with cream cheese or covered in mayo. A few of the nigiri pieces were decent with seared tuna being an option at one point. Would it really be that hard to over some sushi that isn't deep fried or covered in mayo/cream cheese. Also, isn't it a health code violation to not label the food being served? Seems like a big risk to take given how litigious Americans are and the prevalence of food allergies.   Skip Ru San's and go to Mr. Tokyo - you know exactly what you are getting, the staff is friendly, and you can skip the anxiety inducing procedure to get sushi as you order as you go.",

This definitely isn't my first \"low-quality, high quantity\" sushi buffet, but this was the worst I've ever had.   Having just moved to Charlotte and left behind all of my favorite restaurants, I was excited to go to the \"best\" sushi spot in Charlotte.

Used to be a great place years ago but not anymore.  Would not recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "When you're waiting for your flight out of CLT, just finished up some drinks at Sycamore Brewing, and just need some easy sushi, you find Ru San's. This seemingly fast shopping center sushi spot yielded for high hopes, but left me feeling meh.   My girlfriend and I got here on Sunday evening and it seemed rather empty. Despite the pretty visibly open seating, it took them a bit to seat and serve us. Now I will say, this menu is massive. They have almost two full pages is specialty rolls, so keep that in mind for this review. We went with some old reliables and stuck with spicy tuna, spider, and their OMG roll because we didn't want to be too basic. The spicy tuna, rather than being made with a tuna and spicy mayo mix, actually had chunks of tuna with this sweet BBQ sauce on it. Interesting at first bite, but not a repeat. The other two were...well they were sushi. Nothing too exciting and required some siracha on top to make it exciting. Maybe their strength lies in their speciality roles, but I will argue that you need to walk before you roll. *ba dum tss*  For slow service and mediocre sushi, I'm keeping this spot at a 3. Feel free to try out this spot if you're feeling creative because there aren't too many other great options close by. Maybe your adventurousness in sushi picking will provide you with a better experience.",

I'm a huge fan of sushi, but I don't get the appeal of this restaurant so far.   I think their sushi is decent, but not amazing. Maybe because I usually do the sushi buffet, so it's made in mass quantities and has been sitting out for a little while. (If I go again, I'll try ordering something off the actual menu and write an updated review.) It's also confusing because the buffet food isn't clearly labeled! I love trying different types of sushi, so I don't mind this. But it'd be nice to know the names of each so I could get more of the ones I enjoyed.  The presentation/environment of the restaurant is not great either. It's squished and crowded. It also seems a bit dirty.  I've never had a problem with their service, though! Their wait staff is extremely friendly and helpful.",

Get here at 11:15am, before they open, and you will stand in line to get in.  That is not a worry though, because there are plenty of tables and seats at the bars. I will tell you this place is a MADHOUSE!!!  When I left there were people standing in line out the door.  For the lunch buffet I was in an out in 30 minutes.  The sushi quality is good but it is a buffet so you're not going to get top of the line.  There are two Buffet tables set up... one has a nice variety of rolls, and the other has a few traditional Japanese Buffet items....with one small section of salmon nigiri.  Service was very friendly and very fast.  Neat experience to be somewhere this busy, and the quality of sushi is decent.   But I've had better.",

There are a lot of good sushi places across the city and most of them are either a bit pricey for what you get or reasonable but with limited options.  Ru San's satisfies both: reasonably priced and lots of choices.  It's located in a strip mall with a couple other restaurants and a wine shop.  It's a bit tucked away back there but it makes for easier parking!  The service is a little hit or miss, particularly if it's busy (as it usually is on the weekends, so plan accordingly).  That said, I don't mind waiting a little longer when it comes to sushi because of the work that goes into putting it together.  Also, the water dude is on point!  I swear to god, that guy is at the ready every time I take a gulp of my water to fill that thing right back up.  Much appreciated given that I tend to go with the spicier options.  All in all, great spot for reasonably priced sushi and a good time!",

Paying for a $12 sushi lunch buffet is not gonna stop you from taking a trip to the restroom after. Yeah... No thanks, I'll pass.   Sushi is pretty bad. Lol I'm not even gonna sugar coat anything. The quality of the fish is not even close to being fresh.. So if you're looking for some good sashimi, skip out on this place.   Basically, I'm no sushi expert but lets just say most of these awesome 5 star reviews are from people who only knows how to eat California Rolls or Chinese food.   Service is like a 2 out of 5. They're nice but they always make me feel rushed. Like... Please! I just sat down, I haven't even read the front page of the menu yet!! I just need some time to read this book of a menu!!!",

    "text": "DINNER REVIEW (not the buffet)  Honestly, I don't know how they do it. This is probably one of the most innovative sushi places I've been in America, and I LOVE sushi. You won't be ordering the California roll, spicy tuna, or other traditional rolls. Instead, they just do something way off the boat and completely different and have a dedicated menu full of random assortments of sushi.   - Venue I'm honestly sort of partial about the venue. Fairly loud, not high class, but not homey either. I just can't put my finger on it as it doesn't really have a theme. Maybe a good thing?  - Food/Sushi Just a marvel. First of all: VERY WELL PRICED. Everything for the most part is under $10, which is pretty much unheard of for a good sushi restaurant. The sushi itself comes in a variety of different mixtures with a unique look for every different roll. Ru San's has it's own original sushi menu which lists well over 30 different rolls, most of which you may not have ever heard of. I tried a few:  New Moon Maki 10/10: Shrimp sushi with baked scallops on top was to die for. Literally had a bed of scallop that was cooked to perfection and to top it off it had eel sauce (which is my personal favorite).   Pearl Harbor Shrimp Bomb Sushi 10/10: Not necessarily a roll per say, but a huge tempura contraption on top of a huge portion of rice and garlic sauce. Very big portions of tiger shrimp that went very well with the sauce. Pretty much a de-constructed sushi roll.  We had quite a lot of sushi, but those 2 were definitely my highlights. Overall, everything tasted delicious, looked fantastic, and came at good portions for an amazing price.  Would come back as often as possible. Great spot.",

It's a value you just cant find any where else.  The staff is extremely friendly but dont expect to be seated until your entire party has arrived. This is understandable as the place is basically filled from the time they open at 11:30am until lunch ends at 2:30.   We did some Saki bombs and our waitress was kind enough to bring over some napkins just in case they were needed. Our waters were always full and plates cleared quickly.  Don't expect too much in terms of quality and selection if your going to their buffet. But its still a good value for what you pay. If you are picky about sushi, order what you like off their normal menu and you'll be happier. Their normal prices are very reasonable.",

I remember coming here when I first arrived in Charlotte in 2011, but came at night. I thought the Sushi was good but nothing special.....  However, I remained a Ru San BUFFET virgin until Gabriel suggested we enjoy it together on a Friday. And I am SO glad we came here!  The selection of different Sushi's was really wide, and they had a surprising selection of \"hot\" entrees like fried rice and noodles which were very good.  But unquestionably the star was the Sushi. And I partook in almost all of them! My only \"complaint\" was that they were NOT labeled....I would HIGHLY recommend that Management do that so you know what you're eating! Thankfully I liked just about all of it, some more than others.  Then Gabriels orders 2 speciality dishes...the first being a Shrimp Tempura and the other a Fried whole clove of garlic roll. WOW was that ever good! But you better love garlic....and I certainly do!  And of course, they have some really good hot saki for a reasonable price.  Overall this really is a great value and the quality surprisingly good for a BUFFET. It has a definite \"Hipster\" vibe to it and is a lot of fun! Definitely on the recommended list! And thanks Gabriel for sharing this great place with me!",

They give a generous amount of tuna and the sauce blend is absolute perfection.  On my most recent visit, I wasn't overly hungry after the soup and sharing the poke, so I ordered the 5-piece nigiri set of sake salmon.  The salmon as very fresh and cut into healthy pieces.  The service is consistently fast and friendly.  I'd also love to try the lunch buffet one day soon!",

It really is a great place for sushi and I will continue to come here from time to time. I gave 4 stars just because I don't care as much for the atmosphere.  It has a \"diner\" feel to it and it's rather cramped.  It is also a little on the loud side which I don't totally disagree with but when I want a quiet dinner with my wife I'll usually seek sushi elsewhere.

    "text": "Ok, I will give this place an honest 3.5 Yet I keep coming back even though I tell myself I wouldn't. Why? because when you get those sushi cravings, there is no other place in Charlotte, or let alone many parts of the US that is like this. Maybe in New York or like San Francisco...but definitely not in Charlotte. The LUNCH BUFFET that everyone else is raving about is the only thing I have tried. You have a good amount of sushi roll selections, raw, fried, vegetarian and sashimi!! I think the sashimi section is what makes it worth it, 4 plates, usually 2 tuna and 2 salmon. They used to just put out raw sashimi slices around a certain time but the past few times I've been, they stopped doing that (the sashimi is stuck to a a rice roll). That was a huuuge bummer. But oh well, I still come back. Their miso soup is terrible, too pasty and not flavorful at all, no tofu or seaweed it in just the soup. Their lo-mein is also really bad, drenched in sesame oil, which is VERY heavy. I LOOVE their fried rice though, it's quite fluffy mixed with diced carrots and peas. Their calamari is also pretty good.   Also to be fair, I have heard a good amount of sanitation problem with this place, but I think since their last incident a good 5 years or so back, they have really tried to step it up. Never heard about sexual harrassement but I wouldn't be surprised.   Try to get here early for the lunch buffet otherwise you would have to wait and it is a PAIN!",

    "text": "I'm rarely in the mood for sushi, but the BF is so we stop by here every few months. With that said, on my very first visit, I was very pleased to see that they had a little section of vegetarian rolls for $2.95 each. My favorites are the spinach, kimchi, & tempura cream cheese rolls. Ru San's surprisingly has some of the best kimchi I have tasted, besides my mom's of course. It's even better than all of the Korean restaurants I've tried (I haven't tried many.. maybe 5 within the last 3 years?). The kimchi is very sour, just the way it should be!  When I don't want sushi, I just get some steamed veggie dumplings.. yum! I think each order comes with 8 but that's not enough for me so 2 orders it is! The veggie udon noodles are pretty good, but can be very oily. Agedashi tofu is ok.. it's just soft tofu in a tempura batter.. I hate soft tofu.. Also tried the mushroom yakitori.. good 'shrooms, but the sauce is sooo sweet! Blech. The fried ice cream is very good, although I don't like the artificial strawberry sauce they sometimes use to decorate it.  Service can be pretty erratic.. definitely hit or miss, which is why I knocked off a star. I also don't like that sodas are served in cans.. seriously just invest in a soda fountain. Very loud environment, great place for a group of people to hang out but not somewhere I would like to go to regularly.",

    "text": "I come here often,  I can usually tolerate the bad service because the food is so good but this time was probably my last time coming to this location.  We sat immediately and waters were later brought to the table as usual. Our server was so uninterested in his job as a whole. We ordered our food, two sushi rolls and two teriyaki fried rice balls, which are our favorite. Our rice balls came in a timely manner, we finished those pretty quickly and waited for our other food patiently. Being that the host sat us right in front of the sushi bar we were able to see our food come up in the \"window\" ,we also sat and watched our food sit in that window for atleast 10 min while we watched serval servers and other employees walk by it countless times. There was other sushi rolls waiting in the window along with ours and those were taken to their table by who I thought was the manager (bald guy), while ours continued to sit there.   Finally our server, who we haven't seen since he dropped off our rice balls, walks by the sushi counter and I think \"yes! Finally!\" But what does he do? Takes a look at it and continues on his merry way. At this point I'm tempted to go up there and grab my own food but I refrain and continue to wait patiently.   After a few more minutes and more than a few hangry glares our server manages to bring us our food. He never comes back after this, not to refill our waters, not to make sure everything is okay, not to bring us or pick up the check, or even to give us the change for the bill, he never came back, NOT ONCE!   This place is too good to have such poor service",

The good thing about it is that its so busy, nothing sits very long on the buffet line - so that means things are fresher than you might expect from a buffet style meal.  I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. We took a huge group and did the buffet and I remember thinking for the price, it was a good bargain.  Nothing fancy, but you won't leave hungry.",

The only down side, nothing is labeled. So you may have to ask a staff member or your waiter what you're eating if that's a concern of yours. If sushi isn't your thing, they also have another portion of the buffet that includes wings, fried rice, calamari, miso soup, and cake for dessert. $12.50 for all you can eat. Not too bad.",

My recommendation is to get there right when it starts.  There were tons of options from regular rolls, fried rolls, teriyaki chicken, soup, salad, dessert, etc.  I tried to take some pictures but it was so crowded that I couldn't get good ones!   The whole restaurant was filled without an empty seat in the place.  The service was incredible and the lines went fast for sushi and all of the extras.  When a dish ran out, it was replaced immediately.    The best part of it all..... the price!!  $11.99",

The sushi was constantly coming out since it was busy, which was really nice. The sushi pieces are made pretty nicely for a buffet. There were some fried rolls, but I wasn't a huge fan of them since the texture was kind of strange.  You can also trek down a little further in the restaurant to try some chicken wings, stir fry, miso soup, and a little bit of dessert like fruit, cake, or creme puffs. I was pretty full after 3 full plates of sushi and some miso soup. Pace yourselves when you come here to eat!  I took a star off because I often almost ran into waiters/waitresses who didn't really care that you were there, trying to get back to your seat. They often would push their way through so they can get to where they needed to.",

    "text": "Stopped in for the lunch buffet since my daughter was getting a cut at the salon next door (check out my review for that!)  I've been to this location many times for both lunch and dinner. Their regular menu is huge but the lunch buffet has limited options. I'm giving them 3 stars for my whole experience over the course of several visits.  The food here is mediocre. It's not the freshest seafood but it's better than what you get from standard Chinese buffet lines. The lunch buffet food quality is also better but still what you'd expect from a buffet. There are various rolls piled high, several of them are fried. But you're not always sure what you're getting - you can see raw tuna, raw salmon, cream cheese, imitation crab and avocado. Everything else is pretty mysterious. Grab tongs, take one of each and roll the dice! The second part of the buffet is hot and cold foods - miso soup with no tofu, scallions or seaweed to be found. Fried calamari that's tough and oily. The salad is 99% iceberg lettuce but the ginger dressing makes up for It. The other items aren't really worth mentioning.  The dinner time is usually packed. I think the appeal is that they have so many cheap sushi options. You get your fill for a fraction of what It would cost elsewhere. For a cheap date to satisfy a sushi craving, this place hits the spot. But if you're wanting great fresh sushi - go elsewhere.",

I go for the nigiri / sashimi most times but have also found favorites in the miso soup, chicken lettuce wraps and gladiator roll!

Ru San's has had ups and downs over the years especially during construction and redecorating but overall it's still one of my favorites in Charlotte and surrounding area. The selection is great, they have tons of different appetizers and monthly or quarterly special list that has a bit of everything, vegetarian options, a decent buffet, cooked and raw items, and hibachi type meals for those who don't like sushi. The also have something for about any budget and many 3 piece items in case you ant to try something your not sure you will like. It gets a bit loud in here when it's busy so if your looking for a quite meal this is not for you unless it's not busy which is not very often. If you like cooked fish and they have tuna or salmon cheek you should try it, it is also sometimes on the lunch buffet. The serve beer, wine, sake and sake bombs but I don't think they have a liquor license unless that has recently changed.",

Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table and were seated in a booth close to the entrance. Our server was very nice and friendly, but was a bit slow after we placed our orders and it took her a while to get our check and give it back.  The menu is ridiculously big and when I tried to look it up online it was no where to be found, likely because it would crash the computer trying to download it. We started with the tempura appetizer - the batter wasn't crunchy and onion wasn't included, which I found odd since it's a staple tempura veggie. We each had a spicy tuna hand roll. It had lots of big pieces of tuna but the seaweed wrap wasn't crunchy either. Then we had the hamachi sashimi - the pieces were big and too thick (one of my pet peeves for sashimi). We also split a Monsters Inc roll which was good - soft shell crab with spicy tuna and unagi. Perhaps it's best to stick with rolls here.",

Lunch time special is $12 for all you can eat buffet of fresh (yes fresh sushi buffet- crazy, but the plates go so fast that it HAS to be fresh) delicious sushi. Lots of variety too. Nothing crazy or over the top like a rainbow roll but all you usuals. Part of the buffet also includes nigiri, salad, fruit and little desserts. Lord- yes.   I took a handful of co-workers there yesterday and we got there right when they opened at 11:30. We had no problems getting two big tables for our group, and the service was wonderful. They tend to churn people in and out around their lunch time buffet, but even with out group, none of the servers were hasty or pushing us out the door.

The hours we work and the hours they are open make it a perfect place to decompress. Our go-to roll is the Tootsie Roll.  We will usually order about 4 or 5 different rolls, put them in the middle of the table, and dig in.  The staff has been amazing in their recommendations, the sushi has been on point, and the atmosphere is very chill.   One thing that keeps us coming back is the shear variety of the menu.

Don't remember the name of it, sorry :-/. The fish tasted fresh but the white fish was a bit too slimy. The tuna was on point and the sauce they give you with it it's delicious.

It was packed and I was told about the lunch buffet.  $10 for all you could eat of both sushi and a small hot tray area.  I quality of sushi was \"ok\" though without names I wasn't sure of about 80% of what I was eating sushi wise.  Wait staff were all over the place, but did get my beers in a timely manner so no issues there.  PROs - I was glad to get my fill of sushi  at a really good price.......

You have a great dollar sushi menu (try the fried garlic maki), allowing you to sample a wide variety of flavors without breaking the bank.  During the week there's a killer buffet that's always mobbed.  Go early or late to avoid the rush.  Even at the end they're still on top of refreshing the buffet.   Dinner there is always good.  If you decide to do a sake-bomb the entire restaurant cheers you on.  The plum sake if delicious if you want a little sweet in your alcohol.  The tempura is great with a light minimally greasy batter.  Green tea ice cream is a perfect finishing move.  The entire staff (even the chefs) is friendly and attentive.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  My girl and I became regulars early on.  The one bad thing about restaurants in Charlotte is that you have to be told about the good ones.  You really can't drive down a road and \"stumble\" upon it.  Thankfully our Charlotte \"connection\" let us in on the Ru San's secret when we first moved there.  Fun, relaxed atmosphere.  Delicious food with a huge selection.  Incredible artwork (made by the owner himself) hanging on the walls.  What more do I have to say?  Get your ass over to Ru San's and have a sake-bomb for me ;)",

We all got the ginger salad I love salads so I can't complain but the fiance says it's a bit too bitter. We got there around 5 and so it was dinner both my fiance and BIL got the Pork Katsu Don, fried pork cutlet over rice with an egg and mixed vegetables. I got the chicken Katsu that came with rice on the side and mixed veggies also on the side. I thought the chicken Katsu was good a bit bland but it was crispy and good with the veggies. The pork Katsu don was not a good choice because the plating made everything too soggy. No sushi this time maybe next time, if there is a next time.",

It provides me the opportunity to try a variety of sushi along with other buffet items like the soup, salads, calamari, and deserts. The fact that the place is full every time I go there (for lunch) is an indicator that they have something going that is good. Price is right and selection is awesome. Now, I will agree with one review below that expresses some frustration with the lack of labels. Most of the time, I don't know what I'm eating but when it is so good it doesn't really matter. Ru San's doesn't contribute to my sushi 101 learning so when I travel for work and want sushi I can't carry over my Ru San experience into the more sophisticated sushi places. I'm still a fish out of water when ordering sushi (pun intended).  Go have lunch at Ru San's. It's fun with a group of four or more (of course, I guess that depends on the four).",

Over the years I have had several friends mention that the restaurant smells bad, and I have recently noticed it starting to smell worse.  That's less than ideal for a fish and sushi restaurant.     They do have a great menu, and the food is good.  The service is sometimes slow and it's normally very very loud when they are busy.     Last night (Tuesday) and asked for a booth.  The host said they were going to seat me at the bar.  The restaurant was nearly empty.   Another hostess came over, and said we can seat you now at a booth but if we get busy we will move you to the bar.  I was by myself and evidently they want to keep booths for groups of people.  That is understandable I suppose, but when 80 percent of the booths were free does it matter that I wanted to sit at a booth?  She decided in her words to \"just this once\" sit me at a booth very rudely.   I asked her why it mattered and she said they may get busy, and said numerous times that next time I would have to sit at the bar.  It wasn't so much that they have a policy of not letting one person sit at a booth, and slow evenings, so much as how rudely they handled it.   I asked my waitress to speak to a manger. The waitress was very nice and polite, but told me the woman being rude to me was the manager.   I decided I told the waitress she didn't do anything wrong, but I wasn't going stay, and I may not come back.     I didn't catch the managers name, but probably about 40 years old, slim, with long dark hair in a ponytail I think.    I am torn, I do like this restaurant, and overlook the smell and poor service usually for the good selection.  I most likely won't' be back now and will need to find a go to restaurant for Sushi.",

The rolls are affordable (as opposed to other sushi restaurants that can charge up to $22 for a roll!!) and delicious. The sushi tastes fresh is of decent portions and some of the rolls are really fun. My favorite is the Rising Sun Maki. If you're new to sushi you can start out with maki rolls that include chicken or just try tempura fried items or salads.  The service here is usually good but every now and then it will be pretty busy and will have you waiting a little bit longer than you would like. They also offer a lunch buffet but I've only been to it twice. There is something about eating sushi off a buffet that doesn't sit well with me. I would much rather go for dinner and order my rolls to order ensuring the most freshness.  If you're down for a relaxed atmosphere with a tasty, affordable sushi selection, Rusan's is your best bet in the CLT.",

For me, this establishment has done something that very, very few have done before. It gave me a feeling of satisfaction with my sushi. To me, sushi is a type of cuisine based around sticky rice that often involves raw fish. I believe it should be painstakingly prepared by masters with simple yet amazing flavor and design.  While I tried to stay away from their original rolls, the traditional sashimi was expertly prepared. The big bowl udon was fantastic and had all of the old-school additions that remind me of home (I'm chinese by the way.) The beef tataki had good flavor and a good grill on the edges with a nice balanced dipping sauce. The sushi and sashimi assortment dinner is a most-try for those who are new to this type of cuisine.  While all of the food hit the right marks for me, let's talk service. Oh man.. service.  It. Was. Crazy. While some restaurants assert a need to keep things clean and customers happy. The staff here insured every glass was always full of your chosen non-alcoholic beverage. They kept every bottle of sauce full as well with even the smallest amount used to be replaced immediately.  If that isn't pedantic service than I don't know what is. The server even poured my first cup of sake, which is extremely respectful in my eyes.  This place would receive a five star but I feel five stars are only for the restaurants that can either change my ideals, give my a cathartic experience or something along those lines. But it this establishment was just about to hit that mark.",

Best sushi in town). The rolls here have WAY too much rice, making the pieces GIANT. I have to half them (annoying). I end up picking off about 50% of the rice (why are you overloading me with unnecessary white flour carbs?!LOL) Any of the fried rolls I've gotten are the kind that are overly battered, not subtly flash fried like some other great places. Ick. When I go here, I stick with the basic rolls, cali, scorpion, japanese bagel, etc. I don't so specialty rolls here after the fried ones I tried that weren't good.   One thing that really ticked me off this past time was this new $2 \"service charge\" they're throwing on AFTER THEY SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD and without telling you on takeout orders. Wait what??? I don't tip on takeout, sorry. Putting my food in a bag straight from the chef who is salaried does not entitle you to a tip. That's ridiculous. I don't know who this charge goes to whether that be the sushi chefs or the bartenders bagging my food but get real. As little as $2 is and I don't care about it honestly, I won't miss $2 from my bank account, it's just dishonest SNEAKY business practices like this that erk me to the point where I'm not coming back. Let me explain how this went down, and this is a new thing they're doing BTW.  I went to pick up my order, I got 3 rolls, my total was like $19.50 or something. I checked over my receipt, that was the grand total after taxes. So, I handed over my credit card. When I was given the receipts for my signature, there was a \"Srv Chrg\" on it. See attached picture. So basically they charged me some fee, after my credit card was swiped, without telling me.  This should have been disclosed when I placed my order and ESPECIALLY before I paid for it. This is a principle thing to me, it's BS. If they would have said to me on the phone, \"Okay great, that'll be ready in 20 minutes and just so you know there is a $2 srv charg fee for xyz on takeout orders now.\" I would have been like, oh..okay whatever. But they said nothing, just tacked it on my bill without saying a word. That's just unacceptable. And no, it doesn't say anywhere on their online menu that there's a fee for takeout either.   I tried to mark through the $2 charge and wrote my total as $19.50 and they still charged me the fee when I looked at my credit card statement. I may dispute the $2 to prove a point. I just really can't stand stuff like this. Biggest pet peeve ever, probably because I'm a super honest person and I despise dishonesty.   For this reason, I will not be back. I'll find another mediocre sushi place to grab my takeout from. There are plenty.   Pros: The manager or owner is very friendly and welcoming. Sorry to write this review guy, but you gotta know that what y'all are doing, isn't ethical.",

Okay first off why isn't there half stars on here? I always ask myself that because it's rare that I'll ever give something 5 stars!   So it was super busy! Always a good sign and sat outside and it was great. The server was quick and funny as well. I highly recommend trying something you haven't tried instead of your plain old California Roll! Boring! :/   Go for a Bento Box or something crazy like Eel to give your tongue something different. Yum!  I had the Exotic Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Avocado Roll. I must say the Avocado Roll was ON POINT SON! That roll I would give 5 stars ! :D",

I have been going to Ru San's for almost 10 years now, but definitely feel like the service and quality of food has improved over the years.  Ru San's offers a great environment, sushi chefs welcome you, staff running around servers tables, bright lights, TVs, and always a large amount of other diners. With all of that going on know this is not a quiet restaurant. Be prepared to speak a little louder than you normally do, ha ha! As for the food, Ru San's offers something for everyone: sushi, ramem, tempura, yakitori, asian entrees, desserts, beer, wine and saki. So much to choose, and the menu can be overwhelming. I typically stick to sushi as I think they do a decent job and are reasonably priced compared to some others places in the area. To start, don't miss out on the ginger salad, a fresh iceberg lettuce salad with carrots, radishes and a light ginger dressing, and miso...one of my favorites. Always piping out and they sure fill your bowl. Overall Ru San's is a great spot to check out on a weeknight, to miss the large crowds or a weekend to enjoy the loud fun, but as I mentioned and others, be prepared for a wait.",

They used to have several non-seafood sushi roll options including the Spicy Chicken sushi roll and the Ginger Simmered Beef Maki roll.  Now they have nothing except various cheese sushi rolls.  I understand needing to raise the prices but that made no sense.  I was told before the Spicy Chicken sushi roll was discontinued that they might be able to still make it even though it wasn't officially on the menu.  Tonight I found out that's not the case even though they still have the Spicy Tuna roll.    It's still alright but not different than any other sushi place in Charlotte.",

It was around dinner time, the restaurant was packed and the service was fast. Ru San's menu was overwhelmingly large (no complaint), and they had a lot of interesting speciality sushi rolls. There were so many sushi rolls I have never seen in my life! I was so incredibly stoked, until I received them. I eat sushi pretty frequently, and while their rolls were very interesting, they were not very proportionate. This made the plate not only look unsatisfying, but the sushi tasted unbalanced. I looked at the neighboring tables and their sushi seemed to look a lot more appealing than mine, so I am willing to give this restaurant another try. Maybe I just got unlucky? I ordered what the waitress said was their most popular roll. I do not know but I have had better sushi!",

Usually people hear sushi buffet and immediately think yuck I'm gonna get sick but that's not True with this place. Lunch is always busy and the sushi never sits on the buffet longer than 10 minutes, goes like hot cakes. They put out a good variety including specialty rolls and the quality is good. This isn't 5 star gourmet sushi or anything but it's definitely good for the price of 11.95 for lunch. Definitely give it a try, might have to wait for a table and the service is ok,but considering it's a buffet there's not much to do unless your ordering off the menu. I'm excited to try it for dinner sometime!",

I can't remember a single time I come here and receive exceptional customer service. One time, we had a group of 7 girls. They seated us toward the back. Didn't see our waiter for like 15 mins. When he greeted us, he never asked us if we wanted anything to drinks. Just ask if we know what we want to order. My family can consume large amount of sushi. Believe me... So we order a lot. After he drop off our orders. He never came back to fill our water, check up on us or even clear out some of the dirty, empty plates. When we finally said something to him about it, he said well why did you get seated toward the back. They tend to forget about the back tables. My jaw drop and I had to pick it up from the floor. Well no tips for you mister....  They do have great sushi. It's a lively, loud and fun place on the weekend. Sushi are priced nicely. I never had a bad sushi roll there and they have plenty to pick from. I love their fried ice cream. I get it every time. I tell people about their sushi buffet all the time. But I alway mention, don't alway except great customer service because they definitely lack that there.  I will go and have been back to RuSan. However, I just wish they step up their customer services. I know it get a bit crazy and crowded. But a little attention will go far and could've score more stars from peeps like me.",

On top of all that? It's cheap!",

    "text": "For what Ru San's is--a cheap place to get decent sushi--it excels. It offers a very happy medium between fancy (and pricey) sushi with impeccable presentations and the stale and often sketchy \"to-go\" sushi you find in grocery stores.   Here you can find quick service and tasty rolls that won't break the bank. Against all odds, the menu ordered by price (e.g., $1+, $1.5+, $2+) is not only convenient but are of much higher quality that you would expect. As not a huge fan of fish, I was rather excited to see a very palatable and extensive veggie section. It is nice to have options beyond \"the veggie roll\" and indeed the Veggie Futo Maki legitimately rocked my world.  I will say that the lunch buffet--even at the ridiculously price of like $10 for all you can eat sushi, fried noodles, chicken wings, miso soup, and some other classics--was somewhat of a let down. The rolls are mostly rice, often fried, and contain cream cheese. While all of these are a few of my favorite things (along with whiskers on kittens and raindrops on roses), it makes the meal a bit too heavy for having sushi. Plus, there were no veggie options. Overall the buffet does not do Ru San's justice, so I recommend ordering from the menu.  Finally, it can be a bit cold in there, at least during the summers. Do consider bringing a light sweater.",

Rusan's has been a staple in Charlotte for years, and it's easy to see why.  Walking into the place you're greeted with loud sushi chefs yelling at each other in Japanese a bustling crowd - a tell tale sign of fresh ingredients - and tons of fresh fish.  One surprising gem to look out for is the art on the walls.  Really nice stylized modern work by Rusan - I'm assuming to be the owner of the joint.  Who knew the guy could not only put together a sweet sushi place, but slap some paint on a canvas??  The best value they offer, as I mentioned earlier, is the lunch buffet.  For around $11 after tip you can bank on the fact that you'll be so full and groggy at 2:30pm, you'll have to leave the office or get a cup of coffee.  Don't forget to grab one of those bite sized pieces of cake at the end of the bar for dessert - really good!",

Waitress is rushed but easy going. Soup has spaghetti in it? Huh? Tuna was overcooked...and not enough sauce. Overuse and abundance of daikon is compensating for quality, similar to small man buying fancy car.  Firecracker roll was delicious like a donut is delicious. Unagi was pretty good. Spider roll also delicious.  Kirin and a $60 dollar check for 2 stuffed middle aged people. I wiil be back for sure because the menu is sixteen pages long.",

My wife went to the restroom which is very close to the kitchen and as she walked past several members of the kitchen and wait staff yelled sexual innuendos at her while whistling and making lewd gestures.  This happened both as she went into the restroom and came out of it.  After hearing what happened I had her point out the member of staff that did this as she was visibly upset and pretty shaken up.  I confronted him as he passed by and asked him if he said the things she accused him of.  To my surprise he said he did and that he didn't think it was a big deal.   We had not been seated yet and if you've been to Ru San's you know that people just sort of hang out by the front waiting, which is where we were.  At this point we were both very uncomfortable as other members of the staff were smiling and making it known they thought the situation was funny.  I asked to see a manager even though we were absolutely not going to eat here at this point.  I explained to the manager what happened but I was very surprised to hear his response.  He explained to me that his staff regularly treats women like this and  while he apologizes we were offended it was \"just the way it is\".  We had been to this restaurant before and had no problems so this came as a shock to my wife and I. I asked him if he thought it was ok to yell sexually explicit comments at female customers and he replied that he did because it was all in good fun.  Keep in mind other customers could surely hear the things said to my wife coming in and out of the restroom.  If you are ok with patronizing an establishment that thinks it's ok to sexually harass female customers then Ru San's is your place but for the rest of us I can say I will never go there again.",

My son and I went on Saturday night, around nine and had to wait about half an hour, helped along with $2.50 beers on the nice patio they have.  On the advice of another helper, we ordered the wok-fried tiger shrimp appetizer plus a couple of orders of yakitori.  The shrimp was amazing, spicy with cool slices of avocado and little rice cups to scoop it all up.  The yakitori was nothing special and too sweet for my taste.  We ordered a LARGE variety of sushi and maki - the angry spider roll stood out - fried soft shell crab with avocado and topped with spicy crab (krab?).  All of the sushi ($1-$2 ea) was fantastic and comes by the piece which is nice for a larger variety.  They also have half makis for about $2-$3 for 3 pieces.  The smoked salmon sushi stood out.  We also had a roll made with fried oysters and spinach which was amazing and a sweet scallop with chili roll which was great.  Our server was great and very attentive.  This is a special place, bill for everything was $47 - wow.  The only suggestion I would have is to supply diners with paper and pencil to organize your order before the server takes it.  My son wrote our order out on his phone and the waiter copied it from the phone.  Highly recommend this restaurant.",

I often arrive right at 11:30 opening to miss the line that forms at the door.  The line moves fast and I take it as a positive sign that I am not the only one obsessed with a sushi lunch buffet.  The selection of sushi is good if you like small, more common rolls.  If you are looking for the fancy \"American\" sushi then you will need to order off the menu.

The prices on their rolls are excellent, and the food is always great.   It's a little tight inside, but I went with a big group and we still were able to get seated. It wasn't ideal, but it was good enough. I've been in with a kid as well, and the staff was friendly with him and helped the mother get him situated and fed.   Overall, it's earned its reputation as one of the best sushi spots in Charlotte. It's not pretentious, the food is good, the service is friendly, and the prices are great.",

Hit or miss...  The sushi was fun and high quality. We've done the classic California roll, pickled radish and the spicy tuna along with the specialty Gone with the Wind. The specialty Gone with The Wind will probably be a fan favorite for some time. It's a three in one giant disc that is a mouthy watering sensation. The rice Ball was okay... and that can also be said for the yakitori. Skip them and just dive into another roll or two.   The restaurant is loud and busy during dinner. It's not the type of date night for something romantic. You might be able to find a corner but generally speaking it's loud. Huge parking lot and a patio on a nice day can also be added to the positive vibes of Ru San's",

Food - Our friends think the sushi is pretty great.  I had the Rainbow roll and another colorful roll. I sadly was not impressed, I could taste the fish was not very fresh. My fiance had the teriyaki chicken, she wasn't a fan of the chicken or veggies. We won't return, but our friends love the place.",

After moving from uptown (where we had multiple go-to sushi spots), to the Park road area, I was feeling a bit of a loss at where to get sushi. Last night, my husband and I decided to try Ru San's. First off, I appreciate the casual atmosphere. I feel like I could walk in after the gym (if I went to the gym), or for a date night. I think the atmosphere lends itself to both scenarios. Next, I appreciate the fact that the quantity of sushi in relation to the price seemed extremely reasonable. Without name-dropping, I tried a nearby sushi place that was a) more expensive, b) not as good, c) not as much food. Between my husband and I, we got 4 rolls, 2 drinks and spent around $40. I thought the quality was great too!  A star docked because I don't like when popular places don't take reservations/use an app like No Wait (didn't affect us but there was a line when we left), and because the service could've been a little faster.  All in all, in that area you aren't going to find a better deal for good quality sushi anywhere else!",

    "text": "This is an updated review (my third update) and its important to recognize when experiences change. What is important is that the service has been drastically improved over the last few months - the phone is attended consistently (although certainly not high tech), the orders are ready when promised, and they have even helped me through the ordering process on occasion. Its great to see positive change, and I appreciate the apparent effort to make my (still 100% takeout) experience better. Kudos, folks!  My new arbitrary food score: 4. I'm not saying its the best in town, but it's the one I keep going back to over and over while other options exist, and I can eat a ton of it Experience score: 4. I still dislike the \"convenience fee\", the website is still really hard to navigate, and the phone still goes to \"fax\" from time to time...but I no longer dread stopping here, they try to work through a crowded environment as quickly as possible, and the current team responsible for takeout has been really solid.  Note: I'm keeping the original post so folks can see how significant the change has been. I would have been remiss to NOT update my review dramatically!  **Prior 2-Star Post: So the food here is fine. My experience is entirely take-out, as I have no interest in the crowds this place generates. The sushi is generally fresh, and has that \"fishy\" taste only 10-15% of the time. To be clear, this is American Sushi - fried rolls, lots of mayo, etc - and I'm a fan in general of this approach. It is NOT where I go when I want to have anything close to high quality sushi. Regardless, we eat here quite a bit as it is on my way home from work.  The main issue is the restaurant could really care less if they have my business (or anyone else's for that matter). Their phone system is antiquated - it typically takes 4-6 calls to get through, with some going to a \"full\" voicemail, others simply hanging up, and others going directly to a fax line. Their website is indecipherable, but if you do a google search you can find some alternative hidden pages with actual food listed on it - the main page includes nothing that would assist a phone customer with placing an order.  Once in the restaurant, Ru Sans staff treat people in the restaurant as inconvenient roadblock to the staff getting through the night. I'm pretty sure this used to be a cool schtick they employed intentionally and with vigor, but now they just seem bored and detached. I have yet to be treated as anything close to a \"customer\" in this restaurant. Its like the owners know they will have business whether they treat people well or not, so they go out of their way to AVOID doing anything that would make the experience better.  My arbitrary food score: 3.5. It doesn't suck, and I can eat a ton of it Experience score: 1. It actually does suck.  Also, they tack a 10% convenience fee on takeout orders. Even when they take twice as long as they quote to prepare the order. This is not something they advertise or mention prior to pickup, and is - in my opinion - silly since I would never tip less than 10% to anyone providing decent service. Oh, wait...now I get it.",

It was crowded and as a result we choose to eat of the menu since the buffer seemed picked through. The service was awesome. We ate at the bar and I enjoyed watching the live action from the chefs/cooks. We got shrimp tempura and the chicken wings for the appetizer and I got the Chicken YakiSoba and he got the  Chicken Teriyaki. Everything tasted fresh and We'll definitely be going back to try other menu items.",

Downside you have to wait until your entire party is there to be seated but that's fine because it's not the biggest restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Huge menu with plenty of options even things for people who don't care for sushi. The food was very nicely plated and a nice sociable atmosphere. I would recommend this spot to anyone who loves sushi!",

Each time I went up to the sushi table there was a fresh plate for several of the rolls.  My boyfriend isn't a fan of sushi so he sampled the hot food ... it was pleasant enough but it lacked variety.   Overall we had a good time, but I don't think we will add this into the rotation until we sample more places to see what's out there.",

    "text": "Came here one time with friends and thought the sushi was good and the food as well. I decided to bring my husband so I came in tonight and order a 3 rolls and a sashimi appetizer. The sushi rolls were okay. The sashimi was the best it Tasted very fresh. I asked for spicy mayo and I was charge for a $1 for it. Almost every restaurants that gone to do not charge you for spicy mayo if you dine in, the lady that put in the spicy mayo charge me a dollar for order spicy mayo. I was not aware or was I told that I be charged for spicy mayo. I ask the server and he said he was not aware the spicy mayo was on there. It turn out that the lady that put it in was manger. I decided to ask what was going on the manger was like we charge for sauces $1 it's on our menu, well I didn't have the menu on me and I was not aware of that was on the menu that I would charge for spicy mayo, the manger could have told me it be extra and I would not got it. She was really rude about it and didn't even bother to tell me it was extra until after I got it. Didn't even care to take it off and just left it on there even when I said I was not aware of it. The service I got was really good but the manger was just really rude, and should treat customers a little better. I understand but at the same time it's not how you treat you customers and you should always tell your customers  something is extra before you charge them for something. I work in the restaurant business too, I will always tell customers if there an up charge on something, even if it says on the menu.  I think this ruin the experience for me.  And it only getting 2 stars instead of 1 its because the server was very nice about it he kept apologizing when it wasn't his fault when the manger could at least said sorry for not telling me and I would not have mind paying it, not even a a sorry from the manger. Unhappy! Be Aware they will charge you for sauces for $ 1 without telling you.  Don't e surprised when you get the bill. They will charge you for things without Telling you I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Ru San's makes me happy. While the wait sometimes is a pain, I live close enough and frequent often enough, that I know the perfect times to go so we can walk right in and get seated. At this point, we've memorized the menu and I like it. There is literally something for everyone and to satisfy every type of craving -- Sushi, check. Bento boxes with a lot of food for next to nothing, check. Noodles, check. Chicken or meat, check. Fried ball of rice dipped in teriyaki sauce, double check.   I think the quality of the fish is no better or worse anywhere else in Charlotte so thats never been an issue for us and when people raise that concern, I always brush it off. The entire menu is extremely reasonably priced AND they have a cheap as heck lunch all you can eat buffet. Sure, you might not know what you're eating but hey, you're broadening your pallet.   It's a loud, fun atmosphere and the wait staff is friendly and almost always on top of their game, they yell hello and goodbye every time someone walks in or leave - it still always startles me, but I enjoy it. The wait for food is usually pretty short and reasonable and my water is always filled. If it weren't for the occasional crazy lines (though, I think thats a good sign in the restaurant world) and the occasional waiter that forgets we exist - I'd be closing in on 5 stars.",

    "text": "Very similar to what Ayumi W. said, I tried the chirashi bowl and it was mediocre at best. I had been craving fresh sashimi all day and my favorite dish to satisfy my fishy cravings is a chirashi. So, I was obviously very excited when we called ahead to double check that they had this on the menu and quickly drove on over when we got the good news. There was a 15 minute wait (not bad for a Saturday evening) and we were seated by a pleasant host. However, once we were seated, it took a good 8-10 minutes before someone came and greeted us. This is absurd. It wasn't that busy, and by that point we had already flagged a different server down and asked him if he knew who our server was supposed to be. He kindly had someone he was training bring us two cups of water. The girl who eventually came wasn't pleasant or cheerful. Nothing special about her and definitely didn't seem to be trying to make up for the fact that she took forever and a day to greet us. Whatever. I came for chirashi so this was all easy to look past. We placed our order and decided to get an appetizer just in case the food took a while to come out. The pork gyoza we ordered came pretty quickly and was tasty. The sauce it comes with was also super salty (which I like) and yummy, but to my disdain, THEY CHARGE FOR EXTRA. I never understand why restaurants charge extra for a dang DIPPING SAUCE! It wasn't even a large portion. I could understand if it were steeped in saffron or something but this was definitely some basic soy sauce and chili pepper concoction. Also not impressed with the fact that my friend's sake bomb came in a plastic soda cup. Who even does that. This place serves cocktails and you can't even put the beer in a glass???? Okay, now finally to the chirashi. It looked pretty sloppily put together at first sight. The sea bass--okay. The salmon--okay but tasted a little off. The tuna--okay but tasted a little off. The tako--nope. The ikura--nope. The scallop--okay. The fake crab---probably the best thing in there, WHICH IS SAD. The seaweed salad--tasted fine, just like all the other seaweed salad I've ever had. The eel--this was yummy, but there was A TINY LITTLE SINGLE PIECE OF IT. WHY! The tamago--decent, but I feel like the egg mixture should have been mixed more--not used to seeing the white of the egg still largely spread throughout the mixture. The squid--can't really comment on this because I never really like squid sashimi. The red snapper--tough. WHY. Then there was another white fish that I cannot identify; it literally must have been the scraps because it was SUPER tough and looked like they dumped a measly little end piece on there. The other decent stuff in there was the seafood salad (can't remember what it's called, pretty sure it is calamari salad--always placed right next to the wakame). I definitely question the freshness of the ingredients. It was no good and I left very disappointed in my meal. I think Ru San's may be better for their rolls--can't say for sure though as I've never tried them. One lady did say to me while we were initially waiting to be seated that she loved her meal and order the Grinch Roll...so maybe try that while it's the season. Otherwise, DO NOT TRY THE CHIRASHI!!! So mediocre.",

    "text": "Ru San's has a very interesting atmosphere. Note that it is VERY LOUD. Last time I was here, I saw some customers giving dirty looks to the sushi chefs yelling random Japanese phrases. They also whistle when a pretty girl walks by lol That's part of the experience so just a heads up :) Needless to say, Ru San's is very casual.  They have an amazing deal for lunch. They offer a sushi buffet where the chefs basically make whatever rolls they please and they are brought out to the buffet table. There's a good variety, along with sashimi, tempura, salad with ginger dressing, fried rice, dessert, etc. It's only $10! I normally get it to-go because they give you 2 containers to fill for the same price! That works better for me since I don't eat much if I sit down for the buffet. Plus, I'll have some for later! :D  Dinner prices are very reasonable. I wouldn't recommend getting sushi for dinner though. The prices are very affordable, but you basically get what you paid for. I do recommend ANY of their Udon dishes. I've tried some of the Udon soups and they were delicious. I really liked the Nabeyaki Udon. They are called \"Big Bowl Udon Soups\" for a reason! The bowl is huge and will blow you away when it arrives (comes in a clay bowl)! The Spicy Yakiudon Udon, which is stir fry noodles with spicy garlic sauce, is also amazing! I choose mussels as my protein and it was delightful (you can also choose chicken, beef, scallops, shrimp or vegetarian)! Not only is the portion huge, it was less than $10 (the soup dishes too)!  OH, I almost forgot.. DESSERT! The Tempura ice cream is delicious!!! Fried ice cream.. yummm!  It's also a plus that they open later than most restaurants. Late-night hunger for the win! :)",

If you know anything about the tradition of sushi, this is the rebellious son of the traditional eats saying \"screw you, dad, I'm going to play my loud music and go CRAZY.

The waiter was really nice and continued to profusely apologize for the chef's terrible pace (and he comped us free salad too), but a good waiter can't make up for a bad place.  They do have loads of veggie maki rolls, which is a plus. We ordered the cranberry roll, sweet potato roll, teriyaki zucchini roll, inari roll, and kimchi roll. The cranberry was messy and the kimchi was a bit... off but aside from that they were okay.  Don't come here if you have somewhere to be after (I did and I ended up missing it). I'd just say \"don't come here\" in general, but seeing I have yet to find some place better in CLT to go, I guess if you have the time and enjoy loud atmospheres, here's the place for you.",

My fiance always get the cowboy Maki.  The miso soup is wonderful and they always have specials.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is because they close from 230-430p and sometimes that's the perfect lunch time (not a crowd) but the place is so good, my fiance and I waited for an 1/2 hour until they re-opened.  Love this place!",

    "text": "Rusan's is an old friend. No seriously, I used to go there 2+ times per week and I was the Norm of Cheers.  But a move put me further away from it so I'm not as regular as I once was.  While Rusan doesn't come by anymore, the owners Kim & Hata have grown the business through the expansion. It doesn't provide the same swanky ambiance as Enso, but you can go in your shorts.   First, let me admit, I hate the lunchtime buffet. Everyone loves it and it's a great deal, but you're getting the mass produced generic rolls.  Plus it's super crowded. So I order off the menu for lunch.  For dinner, however, they have a huge selection of rolls, but if you sit at the bar and befriend the chefs, the best sushi in town can be found by just asking the chefs to whip something up for you.  They come up with some amazing stuff. That doesn't help, Jules. OK, so some of my favorites off the regular or seasonal menus are the jalapeno Hamachi sashimi, the \"martini\" with macadamia encrusted variety of fish, the Tokyo rock & roll, broiled sea bass, the twice cooked salmon, and seared tuna (add green onion the old way).  I also like the tempura shrimp and sweet potato. Yum.    Rusan's is a place where membership has its rewards, so why don't you become a regular? It's the best sushi value in town. You can bank on it.",

    "text": "What an Experience or maybe an Nightmare!!! The way that I pick the restaurants to eat at is through Yelp. The way that my husband pick the restaurants is through word for mouth.  Both could be beneficial, but I was not too thrilled to go check this place out, and boy was I right. I finally gave in to my hubby because people told him that this is the best Sushi Buffet in Charlotte, (he needs to really stop listening to those people LOL).   The place was jam pack with people who I guess enjoys it, but it was not worth the $25.00 that we paid. This was for two $9.95 adult buffet and three sodas. Yes three sodas for two people, because you don't get free refills since the soda comes in a can. So anytime you want more to drink, you have to order another can of soda (which they don't tell you).   Anyway the place was dirty looking and the buffet setup was in the dark aisle between the bar and other patrons booths. And boy was it a mess. The handles of the tongs were setting on the food and which made it sticky, not enough tongs for each item, so you have to use the same tongs for 3 different items and the food was just thrown on the plate like slop thrown in the trough for pigs. The sushi rolls were not label, so therefore you didn't know what you were eating and if you were allergic to something in the roll that was not seen you was SOL. The calamari tasted as if it was cooked in the same grease as the fried chicken. I guess their play on Chicken calamari!   Best thing on the menu to me which I got three plates of was the....... SALAD and ginger dressing. Best thing on the menu for my husband was...... the Coke in the Can!!!! He hated everything. The most disgusting buffet I have seen.   By the time the bill came, my hubby wanted to walk out, because he did not eat anything!!!! But the two cans of Coke. But we paid our bill and vowed to each other never to come here again!!!  P.S. The servers yell across the restaurant to alert the hostess that people are coming into the restaurant!!! So ignoring, especially since we were sitting at the booth right by the door!!!",

Normally I have a strict rule about eating sushi off a buffet.  Ru San's alleviates some of these concerns by  kindly placing placards stating how long each dish has been out.  They get pretty slammed for lunch, so plan on being there early.  This probably isn't the place to meet friends when you only have an hour lunch.  All in all, it's a great little place, and I always leave pretty dang happy!",

But I bumped it down just because of the no frills type place it is and the fact it can be extremely loud with all the sushi chefs constantly yelling or it's more like war cries but whatever.  I walked in there today and one of them started giving me a power clap style ovation....meh....my kind of guy so I obliged with my own clapping right back!  All in good fun :)  Ok, so no other place in Charlotte does a sushi buffet like this joint.  If you are hungry you can't find a better deal, it's something like $10, for all you can eat.  You could easily spend that on just 2 rolls anywhere else.  The sushi here is kind of \"Americanized\" in my opinion.  I'm not complaining but seriously, just know that if you eat sushi that has been deep fried, um, that's not healthy.    They keep time labels on the sushi plates so as to make sure the sushi is the freshest it can be but normally the sushi runs out before the time does, so that should tell you something!  It's really good.    I will continue to keep Ru San's in my Ru-tation for great local sushi spots! :)  Note: It can get crowded so I suggest getting there as close to 11:30 for lunch, otherwise you may have to wait (even though probably not long).",

And unlike other $1 menu sushi places, Ru San's has options.  Here are some of my regular items: Cajun Maki, Lomi Lomi Salmon, Rock & Roll ($1.50), Bay Shrimp Salad Maki, Spicy Aioli Scallop Maki, Seared Salmon Nigiri, Teriyaki Eggplant Maki... also the Tofu Yakitori is great, as well as Salmon Tempura.  I often walk out of here with a fully belly for under $10.    I personally avoid the lunch buffet but I know plenty of people swear by it.  No offense, I much rather enjoy my sushi that looks like sushi and not sushi shape rice falling apart creations.

The service was lacking and my friends were quite irritated. I spent about $35 dollars on food alone (on just myself) and only got $10 worth of sushi I liked. I am very open-minded and adventurous when it comes to sushi but this time it was to my detriment.

Supposedly you can find a treasure which turns into a gift certificate, but it's not a tasty roll. I recommend the Midnight Club roll and the Volcano roll.  Both are excellent.  Also, try the teriyaki ball.  Get some yakitori/tempura/maki rolls for $1-3 each.  End up with a full stomach after spending around $20. The best way to order is family style where everyone shares.  That way you don't end up eating a whole roll you don't like and have more variety.  Honestly, both times I ordered so much food, and never spent more than $30-35 after tip. Also, it's a nice looking restaurant with a pretty fancy decor, but it's a casual atmosphere, although I hear on the weekends it's pretty bumpin.",

They had changed some stuff on the menu but that was ok since it is so big!!!  Took off one thing I really liked but that's ok since there is tons to choose from.  I ended up trying two new things that were recommended by the bartender and our server Justin!  Very happy with the teryaki eggplant maki and the tempura spinach maki.  And the cold saki was yummy!

Its rare that I find something on the menu I don't like, and you can totally customize your experience. The cost is really good for the amount and quality of food.   HOWEVER...  I would suggest avoiding the lunch buffet. I would give that one star. I was really excited to try it because I've had good meals there before, but it was really sad. The sushi rolls on the buffet are the most common, most American rolls, and have very little fish in them. Really not worth the $10. Feels more like you're paying $10 for rice and cream cheese rolled together. Also, it was a zoo in there when I went. So crowded, bad food, and unpleasant.",

I would come back if I lived around there but I live pretty far lol. At first I was confused because of labels and what not. I really liked the service. The guy even though it was a very busy refilled our drinks very quickly! But for those who want to come try it I would give one heads up. 1.) Go close to the time they open for lunch because we went around 11 before it opened and there was already a line!",

I hate sushi joints who think that just because they are a sushi joint, they can charge $4 for a paper thin piece of sashimi.  Ru San's, on the other hand, will serve you two pieces of toro that are thick enough to throw on the grill, for half the cost.  Easily, the best cuts of fish this side of Japan...and I've eaten at sushi bars all over the US.  (HINT: sit at the bar, get served directly by the chef, and tip the chef after your first round of sashimi comes out...)  Also, the lunch buffet is fantastic for a quick lunch...some people get squeemish when they think of raw fish on a buffet line, but honestly, this place stays so busy at lunch the buffet turns amazingly fast...they are putting out new plates every 10 minutes...and if you are lucky, you will time your trip to the buffet just perfectly when they are putting out a fresh tray of nigiri or sashimi, because those go fast! (NOTE: they don't do sashimi on the buffet everyday, and the pieces are thinner than they cut when you order off the menu when they do...but come on, its a buffet!  Take three slices, stick 'em together, and you got you a REAL piece of sashimi!)  Service can get slow here during peak times, but it is worth the wait.  Enjoy some sake and chill out.  The menu is Truely an amazing sight.  They literally have everything...if you've dreamed about it, chances are it's on the menu.  For those that think this is the \"Americanized\" version of sushi; that is only because you don't order the traditional stuff off the menu.  They have plenty of stuff for the purist as well!  Their handrolls are authentic, and their sushi rice is prepared in the traditional way (i.e. high rice vinegar content, very sticky, etc.).  If you want traditional, stick with the nigiri, sashimi, etc.... all you have to do is ask!    FYI, authentic sushi means you are eating slices of fish, sashimi-style, over a bowl of rice.  No type of roll, other than handroll, is authentic, traditional sushi.  I can't be the first person to pose this question to the haters out there complaining that this isn't \"authentic\" sushi.  Why did you order the deep fried roll smothered in mayo and expect it to be \"authentic\"?  What part of the \"Muy Buena\" roll that you just Yelped about did you expect to be authenticly Japanese, I wonder?   FYI: Don't order the deep fried, mayo covered roll (it clearly states what each roll is/consists of on the menu), then complain that it was deep fried and covered in mayo.  I can promise you a non-authentic experience if you do these things.",

The all-you-can-eat sushi lunch special is great, although you really don't know what you are eating since they don't label the sushi they have on the buffet line, it is all very good. Aside from sushi they also have there 1 Dollar Sushi menu where you can get sushi for very cheap! It is awesome to go there for a quick cheap meal.   The sushi overall is mediocre and you can find better sushi around the area but it is still worth the price you pay!  The atmosphere is very nice, has music playing, tvs around the restaurant and a few friendly wait staff. Why I say a few you may ask? Because some of the waitstaff I feel are just there for the h*ll of working, they don't care about the customers they just want to get paid. It can be very slow if you get a few of those waiters.  Overall Rusans is great and I am sure you will enjoy it!",

I've been going to Ru Sans for as long as I can remember it is one of THE BEST places in the Queen City to get sushi. The rolls are amazing and that is what I go for the sashimi is good too and is always very fresh but I found another place called Yama's that has more exotic sashimi and for eating sushi as long as I have I would have to say the more \"experienced\" sushi people that want some exotic sashimi, notice how I am saying sashimi, should go there. Their rolls are good too but Ru Sans rolls are better. Most of their rolls are very and I mean very flavorful the sauces they use are amazing and the service is very friendly. A lot of times you can catch the owner working alongside the employees and that's pretty cool. He is very friendly as well and hooks us up due to our frequency of visits. If all you're interested in is rolls or you're a beginner to sushi come to Ru Sans because they are definitely worth trying.",

As my brother, a Charlotte sushi-lover, says, you come to Ru San for the rolls and go elsewhere if you're in the mood for nigiri.   We absolutely loved the tuna tataki (piles of perfectly seared tuna atop crisp vegetable filaments with a side of pure heaven as a dipping sauce). Other winners included the Olympic Five Ring Roll, served with yet another divine sauce, this time a spicy aioli, and the Firecracker Roll, quite possibly the most delicious roll I've ever had. As another reviewer pointed out, their specialties tend toward the deep-fried and saucy, but that's ok by me. Just add edamame and Asahi for a nutritious, balanced meal.   Apparently Ru San plummeted in quality when chef and owner Ru left town, but now he's back and has restored the place to its former glory.",

When we arrived, it looked more like a hole-in-the-wall than a typical swanky sushi joint, but that's part of the appeal.  It is very open and kind of loud inside (the chefs yell random Japanese phrases), but I think it made it exciting.  You get complimentary cucumber salad when you arrive, which was delicious!  We ordered Ru San's Tiger Beef to start (to die for!)  For sushi, we tried the Seven Color Rainbow and the Beetle Juice.  Both were phenominal!  They have such a wide assortment of rolls and many are very unique because they contain non-traditional ingredients, such as bananas, tomatoes and other fruits.  The prices were great as well!

    "text": "My bad first impression of this restaurant is their huge menu, it's like 5 pages front and back with food items, and on top of that they gave me another special menu. It's very rare that good restaurants have that many items because it's a nighmare to control the food quality for such a huge selection of food items. I started off with the golden eye, tonkatsu, and yakitori. The golden eye is one of the worst sushi rolls I've had. The roll structure did not hold up very well. It was hard to pick up a piece with chopsticks because of the very thin coat of batter that would slip out right away exposing the very slippery calamari. On top of that, we were given a very strong spicy creamy sauce which I assumed melted American cheese and jalapeno, it tasted like something you would put on a hotdog, however I'm pretty sure it's not the Bata Yaki sauce listed in the menu (soy based sauce). As I mentioned, the sauce was very strong so it was like eating rice with that sauce, I couldn't taste any fish at all. The tonkatsu and yakitori were bland, lazy, and boring. The tonkatsu was not coated with batter evenly. I could clearly tell the meat has been in fridge for too long since the pork cutlet was lightly brown not white. The yakitori was a complete joke and an insult to Japanese cuisine. When you think of meat skewers, you think about the char marks,  the juiciness, and the flavors of the meat. My two yakitori skewers, pork and chicken, came out nothing like that. First of all, who uses chicken breast that cut into cubes for yakitori, literally no fat, no juice, just bland lean meat. Secondly, there were absolutely no char marks on both, they were dry, nasty, bland. We also got the sea food pan fried noodles with spicy garlic sauce, the pork katsu don, some nigiri, and traditional sushi rolls. The sauce was too sweet and spicy. The pork katsu don like I mentioned, the pork cutlet was not deep fried properly and it was not white. However, the egg rice and the veggies were quite good. The sushi were fresh and tasty, just like any other sushi place I've been to in Charlotte. Overall, the service was good. In conclusion, avoid this place if you're looking good authentic Japanese food, you can easily find many good Japanese restaurants in Charlotte that make this place look like a joke.",

The sushi rolls though are tasty!!  The best tip about this place: the bar wraps all the way around - as in an entire \"U\" shaped seating area to watch all the cooking!!",

    "text": "They have the BEST Chirashi Bowl in town, hands DOWN! Years ago, I would order this and it was only $15 bucks.  No one knew about this and I thought it was such a bargain because it comes in a BIG bowl of full on sashimi with soup or salad. I thought it was my little secret so whenever I come here, I always ordered it since I loved it so much. They are very generous with the type of fish as well.  Then after telling my friends about this or they would see my chirashi order comes out (who also has the SAME love for sashimi like I do), they now all ordered it too.  I guess it gained popularity and attentions from the owners/workers since we would have like a table of 4 orders of just chirashi bowls at least 2x or 3x times in a week.  That's A LOT of sashimi but it was so good!  Maybe Rusan's picked up that this was too much of a bargain and upped their prices to $17.95 (considering other sushi places around town at the time 2-3 yrs ago were overcharging chirashi bowl for $22-$25 for a small dinky bowl of raw fish).  What I thought was a steal now is no longer a steal. :(  I was a little upset they would do this but it's still a good deal in Charlotte whenever I'm craving sashimi so much.  Then last summer, they increased the prices up to $19.95, um what?!  I came back last month and I found out they took the Chirashi bowl off their newly updated menu but I still ordered it.  Finds out they charged it to around $22.95 or something like that now. What a bummer.  I won't be surprised if they kept increasing it to $25. Oh well, it doesn't bothers me now since I don't go there often but looks to me like they don't want many people to order it anymore if they had taken it off the menu.  Although I'm a little upset of the increasing prices, I have to say for the most part the chirashi bowls are always extremely abundant & impressive.  This place always has the best sushi and apps as well.  It's also not that pricey at all and you can get pretty full without spending a lot.   Service however, sometimes sucks.  They're never known for their service so don't even bother reviewing about it. It's standard.  They have all you can eat sushi on the weekdays during lunch for $12 bucks (I think) so that's a good deal.  Except all the sushi are very basic (cheap to make) with tons of rice outside and very tiny sushi fillings. Yeah, they're trying to fool you in thinking you're eating for cheap, they know it! haha. Good way for them to make money by trying to get rid of their leftovers. (?)",

It was busy per usual, but I was unhappy when I asked where our appetizer was long after we had ordered it, even our entree. I was told take out was busy but it should be coming out soon. Long story short, our appetizer came out when we were half way through our entree. We were still charged for our appetizer even after I said something and when I asked for more sauce she said that'd be a $1 extra. If I had been told that the wait for my fried calamari would be awhile, I wouldn't have ordered that. Normally my experience is  but last night put a bad taste in my mouth.",

The Vibe: The vibe here isn't anything fancy or special. It can get a little loud. I enjoy sitting at the bar so that you can watch folks prep food. There is ALWAYS a wait on weekends, but they do try and move folks quickly.   The Food: They have a full menu, but order the sushi. All the rolls I've ever had here are good. I love the crispy tuna roll. I have dreams of the crispy tuna roll. I even got a non-sushi eater to try it and love it! I also want to make a case for the Veggie Futo Maki. I know. You all just looked at me like, this girl is plugging the veggie roll? Does she now know how this works? Stay with me...I think often folks just phone it in with veggie rolls, cucumber, avo, carrot, done. This is not that. The veggie roll is interesting and full of flavor and texture! As mentioned, they also do a great buffet lunch. It's a great deal. I will say, sometimes the labels on the buffet aren't the best. But that's part of the fun!   Go to Ru San's. You'll like it.",

We arrived, had a couple appetizers and a beer, then ordered sushi. As we sat talking, we noticed the time was getting later and later and our waiter hadn't been back to our table in 30 minutes. After an hour we asked where are food was, we were told they were really busy and the food was coming... The food never arrived, the waiter didn't apologuze, the manager didn't apologize, and they said they would box the food... It never appeared either! Totally blew us off and we left without eating.

For food we started with the seaweed salad then she ordered nigiri and I ordered the Dancing Eel and gladiator sushi rolls. Both were good but the gladiator was my favorite. Overall it was a good experience friendly & efficient server, good food and drinks, with reasonable prices.

They were also a little slow to refill what was just cleaned out from the buffet. The miso soup was absolutely disgusting and I could not finish it. The teriyaki chicken was as hard as a rock.

It wasn't until today that I noticed one fish (you get 2 pieces of each fish) had mold on it.  Other than that, everything was great and our waitress was super attentive. If you order chirashi or anything sashimi, check and make sure there's no mold! The restaurant itself isn't brightly lit so I can understand how they could have missed it.",

The restaurant is somewhat tight, so be prepared to have to squeeze through people or dodge them if you're coming in around lunch time.  All I ended up ordering was edamame. They were kind of luke warm. Service was good, so thank you for the friendliness.",

I asked if I could get tempura flakes on my spicy salmon roll (they do offer this item even though it's not on the menu) and they actually deep fried the entire roll in tempura batter! I usually don't like cooked salmon in sushi but it was surprisingly tasty. My friend asked for spicy mayo on the side and our waiter never brought it. He was also rushing us (aka checking on us way too frequently and asking \"are you done with that\" with food still on our plates). Like okayyyy I know there's a wait Saturday night and you want to get people in and out but we're fast eaters no need to breathe down our necks",

    "text": "This is a hard pass for me.  After eating lunch there I find their sanitation seriously questionable. Eat here at your own risk.     I have worked at some very fine high end sushi establishments in my time and even those places tend to cut corners (behind the scenes) so every time I eat at a new sushi establishment I keep my eyes open for red flags.  While dining at Ru San's during lunch I happen to catch quite a few gross warning signs and therefore I will not be coming back here under any circumstance. Which is sad because I was super excited about an all you can eat sushi lunch and was even willing to treck the 40 minutes out of my way on the regular if this place lived up to the hype.    First of all as of March 2018 they had a Sanitation score of 91 which is already pretty low for my standards.  They also had servesafe certificates hung alongside.  Typically  servesafe certificates add points to a score so that means that they actually have a high 80s score.  Thats some B grade sushi bs that I don't want to mess with.  2ndly their buffet while impressive at 1st glance was a huge disappointment.  NOTHING IS LABELED! This seems dangerous for people with allergies and illegal but obviously probably not but still you would think they would want to cover their asses and label their seafood products. You only have your eyes to discern what you are actually eating and putting in your body.  However all the rolls seemed to be the same 3 ingredients (tuna, avocado, crab) just mixed around abit.  Every single fried roll they put out wasnt even remotely warm by the time it got onto the buffet.  As I eagerly waited for a fresh plate of fried sushi rolls to come out to the buffet it was clear that they still had been made at least 20 minutes prior to them coming out to the buffet.  And lastly the mother of all red flags happened at the end of our meal.  Our server truly did something so unspeakable and so appalling that I was flabbergasted by it for a few days.  My friend and I had finished our meal but we were still sitting around chatting because it was my birthday and we drove 40 minutes to get here so we were in no rush to leave.  There were still at least 5 tables sitting around us that were still eating. Everything down to our straw wrappers and soy sauce had been prebussed at this point and we only had our waters left in front of us.  I was planning on drinking my water down b4 we left so I would be hydrated for my trip back.  Then it happened.  Our server came over and STUCK HER FINGERS IN MY WATER to pick them up and THEN looks at me and asks me if I was done drinking it.  Well my jaw dropped open and obviously yeah after someone sticks their hands in your drink I'd say I'm done.   Not only was this experience utterly disappointing but it also gave me the bad poops so yeah I am definietly not coming back to this nasty facility they call a sushi restaurant.",

At first I thought, maybe a bad day, but no, it's just how he is. Charging $1 for sauces without telling me is one thing, but paying no attention to us when called and avoiding eye contact to avoid service is just bad. It's sad but next time I come, I'm going to have to request not having him as my server. Have been very disappointed and he also gave us the wrong order and we also waited on some food longer because he gave them to the wrong table. I gave the place a 3 Star even though I so want to rate it a 2 because I am a strong believer in how service affects reviews and tips. And lastly, our water was never refilled... I am a server myself and I am always understanding but this is just unacceptable.  But food was delicious! We got jalepeno candy and candy crush, and if you like soy paper wrapping, those are good with ponzu sauce :) we also got the curry rice ball and fresh rolls - so good! Boyfriend got bento box (kind of overpriced) and wings. It was good :)",

There are plenty of seating options along the bar, booths, and tables. We opted for the bar as we like to watch them make the rolls. On one side of the bar  there are TVs in a two spots which is an added bonus. The atmosphere is lively and fast paced and I absolutely love their shirts, \"Why SOY Serious.\"   Now for the important part..... the food! When you sit down you receive a little sample of cucumber and crab in a special sauce. I ordered the seaweed salad which was delicious. Service is quick and presentation is excellent. For our rolls we ordered the Fire Cracker, Rich & Famous, La La Land, and Ultimate Tuna. They were all absolutely awesome!!!! Our favorite was Ultimate Tuna and La La Land.   You cannot beat the taste or the price. We cannot wait to go back!!!",

You can't beat their price either for the quality you receive. Overall, this is a great place to enjoy decent sushi, drinks, and a good evening.  Took the whole clan yesterday and we had mostly a great experience. Only two issues arose. First, there is no list for you to reserve your name for the next available table. You literally have to stand in line like at a school cafeteria. That wasn't very organized and most of us just stood around lost for a little while until other patrons would tell you the process. This seemed a very odd and inefficient process.  Secondly, the acoustics here are terrible. The cacophony of the loud conversation roar makes it difficult to enjoy a conversation with your table. We had to speak loudly and repeat ourselves frequently even thou we were all a foot from each other. At one point, I felt overwhelmed and slightly frazzled by the noise.  Other than that, our experience, as always, was great. We ordered several rolls that were delicious. Our favorite go-to is the Japanese Bagel Roll with smoked salmon! Totally worth checking out. The kids, being kids, ordered fried rice and Udon noodles. The Udon Noodle bowl was delicious and enough to feed at least two people. The sushi is made fresh and all the food and drinks were delicious.  Ru San's will definitely remain one of our regulars.",

    "text": "Came here for the sushi lunch buffet, $12.50 per person (lunch only, Mondays-Saturdays). There are 2 buffet areas, one is comprised of approximately 10 types of sushi plus tempura, the other has a mixture of soup, nigiri, fried rice, salad, a couple appetizers, and a couple dessert options including delicious cream puffs (though they resemble takoyaki). It would be nice if it was made more obvious that there are 2 buffet areas to grab food from. If my accompanying friend did not tell me about the second table of food, I would have been under the impression that there is such a small selection of food and very disappointed as a result. The sushi was in a well-lit area, and the second table of food was in a very poorly-lit area. Also, there are labels in front of the sushi that indicate how long the sushi have been sitting out. However, there are no labels to identify each type of sushi. I did not have a chance to try the soup, but the sushi was pretty good. I wish there were more nigiri options. Laying out sashimi would be nice too. The second table of food seemed to have such a random array of food. At the very least, the nigiri should be placed on the sushi table. Service was good. I never ran out of water, and our plates never stacked up. This place is a bit tucked away, but if you want a good deal on sushi and you're in the area, check this place out.",

Don't get me wrong, I love avocado/cuke rolls, but one does crave deviation, occasionally.  Apart from that, I've had the Yasai soba (my fiance's angry tummy can attest to the broth being fish-based, as tradition dictates), edamame, fried rice (very good, but hey, it's fried rice), a few other hot items. But it's all about the vegetable tempura roll (special order) or what I like to call the bagel - tomato, cream cheese, scallion, toasted sesame seeds, deep fried (another special order). Yeehaw.",

I am so glad I told her what I liked because my sushi roll was soooo AMAZING!  There sushi is the cheapest sushi (priced\") in that Charlotte area and in my opinion...the best I have had to this date!  my roll was $8.95.  However, there beer prices are high which is disappointing because I do love a good beer with dinner.  I had a japanese beer \"(12 oz) and it was $4.50.  This price of the beer will not deter me from dining at Ru San's but I will be limiting my alcohol consumption due to the price.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for dining.

On my last visit the waiter dropped sushi in my lap, when it was finally replaced it was awful and then we had to wait 25 minutes for the check(and no, it wasn't very busy).  Ru Sans i am so over you and i will have a hard time trusting food advice from anyone that isn't.",

Our waitress was running around like a jackrabbit without paying attention to anything. She messed up not one but three of our dishes (luckily we were at the bar so the guy who was making our sushi fixed it right away). The so called 'Japanese' food is made by mexicans who look to one white guy for guidance on how to make stuff. Yeah..not exactly authentic. This was a big waste of time and money.  It gets a star because they had Sapporo beer.",

The atmosphere is pretty casual but  doesn't forsake the clubby music you hear in most modern sushi places. There's lots of affordable maki, including specialty maki - the Hidden Treasure is intensely amazing. They have some maki offerings that are only 3 pieces, in case you just want a little taste of something. Super cheap tempura and yakitori as well. The tempura ice cream is heavenly. I'm a big sake fan, and Ru San's has hot plum sake which I haven't seen often. If you're in the mood for a hot entree, they also have a large selection of noodles, rice and seafood selections.",

We ordered the yakitori as an appetizer:  Conch, Sea Bass, Mushrooms.  The yakitori was covered in too much sauce and didn't taste grilled like the kind we ate in Japan.  Next, we ordered the Super Protein Sushi Platter to split.  It was a great value and delicious.  The Saketinis were tasty, but not very strong.  I enjoyed my experience there and look forward to visiting again.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying that Ru San's was at one point, one of my favorite places to dine at, in Charlotte. Previous to my last dining experience there, I had never been disapppointed by their food, or staff. The food was generally pretty good, (pretty difficult to mess up tempura, just bring it out as soon as possible, and you're golden) and the staff was always so welcoming, and attentive. They usually remembered what my wife and I get, and bring it out very quickly. Our dining time was a pretty standard thirty minutes total.       However, this afternoon, I was absolutely disrespected by the server that waited on us, and I will not be returning to Ru San's. When we were very first seated, she neither offered us drinks, or even actually spoke to us. She gestured to us, in passing, \"Need a minute?\" While putting her finger up. I shook my head and said no, that we were ready, but she was long gone. When she did come back a \"minute\" (about 10, in reality) later, she stood there silently waiting for us to order, not even looking at us or greeting us in any way. We ordered various vegetable tempura, three different yakatori, miso soup and a california roll. The miso came out first, about ten minutes after our server walked away from us without even repeating what we'd ordered or asking if we would like drinks. \"Ya'll cool with water? Greatwaddayahavin?\" The spoon had literally fallen into the soup, and she didn't offered a napkin, or a new spoon, just sat it down at the edge of the table and walked away. The yakatori was brought out by a bus boy, who apologized for the wait, (it had been almost 10 minutes since the soup) and asked if we were doing all right, and how the food was. Then, she brought out the tempura, which was all plated together, even though we made a point to order separately. I'm vegetarian and my wife had ordered shrimp, while I had vegetables. She didn't even bring a second plate! She turned around after walking away and almost shouted to us, \"wanna 'nother plate?\" Without even stopping to wait for a reply, let alone walk back and actually stand and speak to us. The sauce the tempura comes with, had spilled out, essentially ruining it, because not only had it become soggy but it was also clear that it had been sitting for some time. The middles of my veggies were soaked in cold oil, and the outsides were totally soggy. Normally it comes out piping hot, light, fluffy and crisp. This was anything but. I looked for our server for about 10 minutes, rubber necking trying to spot her on the floor, and catch her eye. Eventually a bus boy came over, and offered to get her for us. While she was down chatting with a larger table, he motioned, called for her by name, and even shouted our table number to no avail. At this point our food was cold, soggy, and inedible. We could have sent it back, but by now I just wanted to get my check and leave as it had been 45 minutes since I ordered, and I was now running late. And that roll I ordered? Never even saw it. She walked passed the table, and on the second time after ignoring my calls for help, my politely saying \"Excuse me, ma'am? Ma'am, I just need a second...\" as she passed my table, without stopping, said, \"oh, that roll.\" And kept on walking! At this point, I didn't even want the thing! I just wanted my check, and if she had stopped for two seconds, just two seconds spent, actually in front of my table, speaking directly to me, instead of shouting to me in passing, all of this could have been avoided. It wasn't even busy, she didn't even have the excuse that she was swamped with tables. She literally had two other tables in her section, one of which had already received their check! There were more emtpy booths, than occupied ones at the time we ate.      I understand that I was a smaller ticket, but had this young woman at least seen to it that I received the food that I had ordered 45 minutes ago, and actually brought out our food, not left it to the bus boys,  I would have compensated for the fact that the food is cheap, by tipping at least 50%, if not more, which is my usual there. I have worked in the service/food industry for seven years, I know how much tips mean. Instead of, after realizing that I was missing food, skipping the kitchen and going to laugh and chat with her six top, then coming back by and blaming it on the food runners, that my roll, that she never bothered alerting anyone was missing, had not arrived!       Even after all this, her tip could have been saved, had she apologized even once for the poor service and missing food. But no, instead when I received my bill, the missing food was still on the ticket!     For fear of being seated in this girls section again, I won't be returning for some time. Hopefully no one else who is a light eater, heavy tipper and generally very easy table has the poor luck of sitting in this girls section, and being ignored based on the dollar amount of the food you order.",

Tons of food for a great value.  We like to order weird stuff (I find it's easier to eat something unfamiliar if you aren't exactly sure what it is), so their big plate thingies (forget what they are called) are great for that.  Just a bunch of delicious weird stuff piled onto a huge plate.  Done.  Love the atmosphere here, too - everyone is very friendly and upbeat.  Delicious rolls too!

The sauce was very strong, tasted like pure soy sauce, not diluted at all and just did not taste good. Even when I don't like dishes I usually eat it anyway so for me to send something back to the kitchen it has to be REALLY bad, I believe this is the first time I've sent something back anywhere. The waiter gave me a really hard time about sending the dish back, he kept insisting that I wanted a spicy dish, I kept telling him that I like spicy food and that was not the problem. Ugh eventually he talked to the owner (so he claims) and took the dish back. Then he brought the check and for some reason combined me and my friend's check, when I asked him to separate it he made a rude comment about me having to only pay for the miso soup I ordered. I still left him a 20% tip even though I shouldn't have, he would have gotten an even nicer tip if he had just taken the noodles back and showed good hospitality.",

There is a lot to love about this place-  they have a huge and creative menu, they have a large selection of dollar rolls, and they have a high energy staff that is entertaining.  However, as the years have passed I have fallen out of love with Ru San's.  The main problem I have with this place is that their health code rating has fallen (more than once) into the 70s and that is just gross.  One time they were reportedly docked points because food had been picked-up off the floor and then served.  I have also been there before and seen that they weren't refridgerating all of the fish (I'm talking stacks of crab sticks just sitting out  on a table, and they weren't about to be used).  If this doesn't dissuade you, my friends have gotten sick several times after eating at the Nashville location.  EDIT:  They have recently remodeled and I was quite impressed with the lunch buffet.  I checked and the health code rating was above a 95.",

Wonton, four thin slices of sashimi, wonton, four more slices, and so on. Great combination. I like a little crunchy with my sashimi and the fried wonton stayed crispy down to the last bite.  I could have made a meal of of the bacon-wrapped scallop yakatori appetizers. Mmmmm!  I didn't try any sushi but I was sitting at the bar watching them prepare them and their rolls looked great too.

The lunch buffet is delicious and lots of hot options, tons of great sushi rolls, and even dessert! All of the food was great. My only complaint is that they do not have a \"permanent\" buffet area. So they set it up and break it down each day. So when you go into the restaurant you can tell that it wasn't necessarily designed to have the buffet. The spacing and set up is a little bit awkward.   The last time I went with my friend we got the soft shell crab appetizer! It was out of this world! I would highly recommend ordering it if you like tempura soft shell crab.   For our entrees my friend got a sashimi rice bowl that had tons of different items on it. It had a great variety. You definitely get your moneys worth when you order that dish. I got two rolls - one was from their specials menu and the other was on the regular menu. Both of them were good. One was a chipotle roll - I didn't like how it had like a dry seasoning sprinkled on it that you could feel the gritty texture of in your mouth.   The service the night we went was HORRENDOUS. After being seating it was probably about 5-10 minutes until the waiter came up to us and go our drink orders. Then it was about 5 mins for our drinks to come. Then he delivered our drinks and walked away from us even though we were ready to order. He disappeared for another 5-10 minutes. We placed our order. My friends entree came first. Then a few minutes later my rolls came. Then last to arrive was the APPETIZER! The guy was nice - but the service was a joke. I am basically giving them a higher rating because I love the food here. I also like the atmosphere of the restaurant - they play good music!",

I did like the huge number of selections available but the service is a bit on the slow side. The pork belly fried rice was good but not worth it and some of the rolls were good. I was most impressed by the Sea waves since the mussels were good and the spinach with it was excellent. The tuna tatami was nothing special at all- wish I could get my money back for this dish.",

I wouldn't have known this was location unless somebody told me. Also if you're looking for good wheelchair accessibility it has its downfalls as well. They have a semi ramp on the side next to parking to enter the narrow doorway. I was able to get in if someone held the door. Upon arriving you have to wait to be seated which is quite alright but if you're in a narrow entrance way with the wheelchair and a group of people, the people leaving the restaurant somewhat collide with the people waiting to be seated. I would give four stars for the wait staff! They are very helpful. We decided to come during buffet time because we had heard so much \"good things\" about it. I really don't get it. The food quality was mediocre. The buffet was not at all tidy. Most of the items that were laid out didn't even have a description of what it was leaving you constantly asking the wait staff, \"What is this\"? This I found very annoying. I found that not knowing what was in front of me could be dangerous if I had any allergies to any of the ingredients! In all fairness this place might be great for someone that's not really into good sushi... I could name a few other places that were so much better and a lot cheaper. I know it's all you can eat but after 2 rounds of trying to get a good selection of the \"unknown sushi\"... I stopped and got the check. I would return if a few things were improved. 1. Buffet station, it really needs a description of what every item is. Drink refills you don't have any! They only search my Coke in a can. Maybe keep all the hot food on one separate table and the cold food on another!?",

    "text": "YYAAAAASSS!!  I'm so excited to see an affordable and delicious sushi place with unique offerings.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomach... we ordered ramen, a \"super power builder\", a curry and teriyaki rice balls.  I was so excited to see such a varied menu with ramen and stir-fried noodles.  This is my dream place.  Everything was bigger than expected.  The ramen was in a big bowl, the \"super power builder\" had 2 appetizer sides of like tuna and salmon tartar, and the rice balls were exactly 3 times bigger than we had thought they would be.  And so our journey began.  The rice balls came out first.  They were $2.75 a piece and for some reason my partner and I were thinking they'd be the size of truffle balls, instead of an extra big onigiri.  They were fried and had a good ladle-full of sauce spread over them.  The sauce was good - especially the curry.  I was kind of expecting the darker brown japanese curry, but it was more like a coconut thai-inspired curry.  Some might think this rice ball is plain, but my partner and I are really big fans of rice sooo it worked out.  The Tokyo Shoyu Ramen was so-so.  It didn't have the depth of umami in the broth or pork that I have come to admire in a really good bowl.  It didn't have the boiled egg, but it did have some vegetables that were nice to see in a ramen.  The Super Power Builder sushi plate was phenomenal.  The crab cake was good.  It wasn't cheaply filled with bread crumbs like I have seen at some seafood places, which is usually disappointing.  All of the rolls were well made and fresh.  But I was super impressed with the Ahi-Poki Tuna and Salmon Aioli Sashimi - I didn't know what to expect with these items.  I just thought it'd be a few sashimi pieces, but they were nicely dressed pieces of sashimi atop a crispy cracker.  Delicious.  Overall - I would HIGHLY recommend.  This place really hit the sushi craving with some unique offerings.  I can't wait to go back and try more.",

    "text": "As time goes by, I get progressively more disoriented by the notion of \"sushi\" in this country.  At least in non-coastal areas, it gets more and more Americanized, and the focus is always retreating from fresh seafood and simplicity and clarity and shifting instead to ludicrous, over-the-top, and often gross combinations of junk food and squirted-on goop.  The latter doesn't even connote \"sushi\" in my brain, but then I'm getting frigging old.  Still, the brother and I wanted some sushi when I was visiting him in Charlotte, and I saw that there was a Ru San's.  Ru San's is hardly \"traditional,\" but the original location in Atlanta was one of the first few sushi places I ever visited with any regularity, a quarter century or so ago.  And it was the first I went to that offered up that SoCal Americanized angle--a contrast to the serene, dignified atmosphere of traditional Japanese restaurants, which were more plentiful back then--although it also had the more traditional sushi, too.  Whoever owns these Ru San's locations these days (no idea), this one's still not at all unlike what I remember from the '90s.  (By 2019 standards, the atmosphere is a bit more sedate than the average party scene at some 2010s \"sushi\" places, but lively and engaging enough.  There's an attractive and lengthy U-shaped sushi bar in the middle.)  The menu is huge and ought to have something to please just about anybody, including me.  We ordered up some standard nigiri--tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea urchin, mackerel--and a few old-school Americanized rolls like spicy tuna and a rainbow roll (and maybe one other).  Everything was quite good, except for the uni and mackerel; the uni seemed a bit muddy (that product needs to be super fresh), and the mackerel was a bit dried-out and fishy.  Reasonably priced, too:  Around 60 bucks for a decent amount of mostly agreeable sushi, a couple of seaweed salads, and a couple of beers.  (In my current town, 60 bucks would buy you only trash if you ordered the same amount of sushi.)  In this day and age, I know that you can do a hell of a lot worse with \"sushi\" than this Ru San's location.  Nice job.",

We ordered the Ultimate Tuna Roll, Green Dragon Roll, Atomic Salmon Roll, BBQ Steak Roll, and the Chipotle Roll. All of them were excellent and well worth the price.

Then some friends told us we were doing it wrong and needed to order off the menu (go figure, buffet sushi isn't the best).   We came back with them to give it another try and let them order for us. A few of the rolls I think we got were the Ultimate Tuna Roll, Green Dragon Roll, Atomic Salmon Roll, BBQ Steak Roll. There were definitely a couple more that we got, but since we didn't order, I can't remember what they were.   We loved all of them. My favorites were probably the Green Dragon Roll and the Ultimate Tuna Roll. We also got the Curry Rice appetizer which was really good.   Overall I think this was some of the best sushi you can get in Charlotte for the price. It was about $20 each and we left stuffed. Definitely worth checking out and ordering off the menu instead of doing the buffet!",

    "text": "First: I ordered Postmates a few moths ago for 2 rolls - absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend their specialty sushi rolls.   Last week I returned to try the $12.50 lunch buffet today- they offer during lunch.   Pros: -Price: it's hard to beat this price- especially on the weekends!! -Yum!: the rolls were very tasty. About half were fried, the other rolls were fresh -Service: the service was attentive and prompt. Also I came at 2pm and was seated immediately -Freshness Labeled: labels indicate when the rolls were set out to see how freshly made they are -Get the FRIED RICE. seriously I would go just for that- so much flavor and I almost ignored it on the buffet.   Cons: -Small Buffett:  I imagined the buffet would be larger. There's an ~8ft section dedicated to sushi - about 10 different platters. The other 8ft section of table is salad, appetizers (only 3 or 4 options), 2 desserts and salmon nigiri -No Sushi Labels: the appetizers are labeled, but the sushi roll section is not. If you have any allergies or diet restrictions it would be difficult to choose a safe roll -Apps: don't waste your plate space on the calamari or spring rolls- they were a disappointment  -Decor: it's a little dingy and... gray. Not sure how else to describe it. I don't think I'd head here for the ambiance or a romantic date",

    "text": "Today I tired RuSan's $13.00 Lunch Buffet, another yelper friend reached out to me and wanted to grab sushi so I suggested here! When I arrived at 1:00 pm surprisingly the restaurant wasn't busy. Normally its slammed around this time but I was able to walk right in and grab a table. Most people are probably still enjoying their holiday.   After grabbing my table my server came out and greeted me with a glass of water. I mentioned that I would be waiting for a friend to arrive and we would be having the buffet. After about 5 minutes of waiting for my friend, I decided to go ahead and begin round one. The sushi looked good, I like how they have the times of when the rolls were made, place in front of each plate. The buffet has about 15 different options, but each roll that comes out will be different. I love this, it gives you the chance to try an assortment of sushi rolls.   Then there's another buffet which I guess is like a hot bar that had sashimi, fried chicken, spring rolls, beef and broccoli, calamari, and lots more, even dessert. This is such a great lunch choice, but I would suggest eating her when you don't have to go back to work. Oh my gosh after 3 1/2 plates all I wanted was my bed. Thankfully I didn't have to go back to work this day. But if I would have, nothing would have been accomplished lol.   Overall great experience, I did have a little situation with our server but he and I discussed it and he apologized.",

My only thing is that the offerings are still about the same  while the price has gone up a couple dollars over the years but I know what I'm getting so I can't complain about that. If you just wanna stuff your face with some sushi, eat some calamari, and have some cream puffs, this is your place. It's only available from 11-2 Mon - Sat and not on Sundays. Still a good deal for a filling lunch.",

    "text": "The Sushi Review  Ru San's  Despite the fact that this secluded corner-style-deli type sushi restaurant  Has become the trendy place to \"see and be seen\"; this spot is still hands down my favorite sushi place in all of Charlotte.  Even before a much needed renovation in the dining area this locally owned hangout spot was notorious for hosting gatherings of local \"D List\" celebrities, DJ's, filmmakers and underground multimedia kingpins (AKA the F List) such as yours truly. I'm not even going to try to deny it, the first time I went there I was trying to \"hang face\" and see what the entire buzz was about. Well, I soon found out. You have to understand, most actors are servers, most DJ's live with their moms and most indie filmmakers are starving artists. This isn't exactly the disposable income crowd. The prices on the sushi menu reflect that need for value. The quality at such a low price is unmatched. They have a great selection as well. Try and remember that these reviews are all about the \"Maki\", baby. This was the first place I tried the now infamous \"tempura philly\" (soon to be known as a soundboy roll); a maki roll with salmon and cream cheese that is battered and flash fried in peanut oil. If you don't see it on the menu, ask for it - you will thank me.   Ru sans is the best affordable sushi I have had thus far, including some trendier hipper spots in LA and Miami. Don't get me wrong, I was as shocked as anyone else to find great sushi in Charlotte, regardless of the price. They are centrally located on the upper end of Park Road so afterwards you can take the long stroll over to SouthEnd for drinks or maybe catch the train uptown. In any case Ru Sans gets a total thumbs up from me and I would recommend it to anyone. Just remember that it is small, so get there early. The service could be little better, but \"this aint the ritz\" so to speak. Go for the sushi, go BACK for the price.",

The night we were there it was very slow .(Monday night) but the service was good, the beer was excellent and the sake bombs were flowing freely.  In other words Ru-San's is back.  The Salmon and Tuna Nigiri were very fresh and the tuna was sliced so thin it just melted in my mouth.  We got the house sake' and  dropped shots of it into the Kirin Ichiban and the Sapporo Gold to enjoy the sake Bombs.  But the highlight of the meal, and the reason Ru-San's will always have a place in my heart is the FIRECRACKER, if you go to Ru-San's this is a must, its a lightly battered and fried tune and rice roll with an amazing spicy dipping sauce, oooh it is soooo good, gotta get the firecracker.",

For lunch there is a buffet bar with all you can eat sushi - which is awesome.  I definitely went a little crazy and left very full.  The sushi wasn't the best ever, but enough to satisfy my palate and a great value for weekday lunch.  Dinner is the standard order-from-menu sushi fare.  Ru San's has an overwhelming amount of selection.  They have a lot of inventive rolls with ingredients all over the place - I think I had one with beef at one point.  The crazy rolls are about $7 or $8.  Additionally they have a \"value\" section of standard choices that you can get for $1, which is fun and affordable.  I chose a crazy roll and a few value items and had a great meal.  On the weekend night I went to Ru San's the atmosphere was very festive - there were a ton of young people and electronicish music.  There was some crazy bachelorette party at one of the large tables (good for groups!) in the back.  They have Asian inspired art on the wall that is signed by \"Ru San.\"  This Ru San seems like a renaissance-person.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and I had an overall enjoyable experience.  Will definitely go again.",

For dinner, the rolls are way more creative - try the punk rock and roll (my favorite!) and the Jana Moon.  I have found ordering the chirashi at a sushi restaurant gives you a good idea of the quality of the fish, and I have to say the quality here is not the greatest.  Stick to the rolls and shy away from any sashimi other than tuna and salmon.  Would be a great restaurant to bring out of town guests to!",

American-ized, tamed down sushi, a lot of the fish are cooked, so you can have a whole meal with cooked fish. Fun atmosphere, good drinks. great for beginners  and those who are somewhat new to sushi.  Not authentic, buts that is what they are selling, new modern sushi with lots of fun and alcohol.",

The first time I went, the chef was disappointed that I could CLOSE THE LID on my box, and insisted I go back for more.

Ru Sans has a HUGE menu - it is mostly sushi which I don't enjoy, but I was still impressed that they were even able to offer so many things. I don't remember exactly what it was called, but I had spicy udon noodles with vegetables - they were indeed very spicy! I love spicy food, and these almost seemed too spicy, but yet I could not stop eating them. So delicious! The fried rice has an almost smokey flavor to it (my boyfriend says its from authentic use of a wok), and both entrees left us with a bill under $30 for dinner. Not bad! The entire staff was very friendly; the guys rolling sushi on the line said hello and goodbye to us, and thanked us for coming in....all six of them at once - it was overwhelming when we came in, but when we left we gathered that it is custom to their culture, which in the end I found to be a bit endearing. Overall, a very friendly, fun place to grab a quick lunch or dinner!",

I'm usually good with choosing rolls I want, but after 2 beers and 2 sake bombs, I was having issues with everything. Quality of sushi wasn't the worst I've had in CLT, but def not the best either. Space was large and well lit. Atmosphere was lively with the sushi chefs shouting greetings at everyone and cheering on any would be sake bomb drinkers. TVs are aplenty, which is nice if you want to watch a game whilst eating your face off. And parking is ample. The Ru San's in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta is better and has more selection, but the chefs share the same enthusiasm. I'll have to come back for $10 sushi buffet.",

While the latter still may be fun, the sushi quality has plummeted.  We ordered the Pearl Harbor, which is a deep fried shrimp tempura entree. It was very disgusting and bathed in a very MSG heavy sauce. Did not like.  Additionally, the server set us in the back near the bathrooms and kitchen. What this led to was us seeing how dirty the kitchen actually is, along with seeing the waiters congregate and eat people's unfinished dishes in the back. Gross.  Won't be coming back and it is a shame that Ru Sans has fallen to this level. On the plus side, the sake selection is still very good and the lychee sake is excellent.",

This was the worst customer service I have had all year long and tasted worse than many of Charlotte's other sushi selection.what can you expect when u get to pick sushi pieces off a dollar menu, let me know next time ill hit McDonald's.... First off my meal arrived 10 minutes prior to my friend's meal, they had forgotten it, I completely finished my food before they brought my friends meal. The sushi, I would say tastes like the per made at Harris teeter, oops I meant food lion. It fell apart as I was trying to grab half of it and I had not gotten the spicy aioli I ordered out on top of everything as I asked...     Meanwhile the waitress was running around doing lord knows what and seemed to want to have nothing to do with us, she was a tall older caucasian lady. Never once was I asked how's my food, which it was bad and wrong. It honestly seemed that the bus boy was getting us drinks and was communicating with our server for us. Ridiculous.   After my friend finishes eating, we sit talking for ten minutes hoping to get our check and the waitress has now been gone for over twenty minutes...I had to ask a random server to get our check and bring it to us.  our waitress comes up drops the bills off and leaves not even bothering to communicate what it was she had disappeared for or apologize for us having to ask Someone else to do her work.   On top of all the terrible service and disgusting food received so far.. She added a beer to the wrong check and completely messes up the bill. To our luck the manager walks up. I try and tell her a mistake was made but the lady speaks next to Zero English. It was like talking to the Great Wall of China. And to my surprise it looks like the lady is getting angrier as i tell her they have made a mistake it was like talking to my 8 year old nephew. As I'm in the middle of trying to explain to her she rudely Snatches the bill and my money out of my hand and walks away after telling me that I am cursing at her which I am not at all. On top of all this TErrible service. They then bring me the wrong amount of change, short a few dollars. Brought by some short fat girl with a buzz covered in tattoos, wierd. She then proceeds to tell us that we should not be rude to the owner of the place and if we do not like the food we should not come back. expecting an apology from the staff, me and my friend were obviously shocked at the lack of care and disrespect this establishment shows to its patrons. I threw the remaining cents in my pocket on the table in disgust, only as a bitter reminder of her atrocity to waitressing and the management in general at Rusan's.  This was my third time here and i will never be returning. I live in the neighborhood and am glad to say they have lost my business and i hope yours too if you read this.This place was a HORROR SHOW.",

That is not to say that if one had a more ample sushi budget you couldn't find some creative and complex maki, for you certainly can. I, however, am a diehard fan of the dollar menu. That's right kids, there is a whole section of the menu where a Sacajawea can get you a 3 piece maki. That means that for less than what I generally shell out at Starbucks I can get a fresh mix and match meal including a variety of fish and sauces.  Their sake cocktails are pretty tasty as well (I first gave them a try in order to reach the loosely enforced $10 credit card minimum). Do be warned That if you are not generally a fruity/sweet cocktail drinker sine selections may be a touch overwhelming.  While I have certainly enjoyed the Ru San's experience with a group of friends and for dinner w/the bf, my favorite Ru San's trip by far was pulling up a seat at the bar (which has purse hooks!) by myself. So next time you are looking for a spot to grab a lighter solo meal, I'd definitely point you in Ru San's direction.",

We ordered 5 vegetarian rolls and paid around $17. i thoroughly enjoyed all of them except for the peanut roll. The peanut roll was really just peanuts in a roll. i thought maybe it would have some peanuts with something else, but no, just peanuts. Everything else was delicious: avocado, teriyaki zucchini, coconut tofu, and something else. i do put a little Sriracha sauce on everything, so maybe i just like the taste of that and could eat just about anything. Either way, i thought it was very good, very affordable, and plan to go back.",

However I think Ru San's still has some of the best deals out there for sushi, and the sushi is good and fresh. 5 pieces of Sashimi for $7 and these are not skimpy that is an awesome price.  For someone who likes to indulge in sushi a couple of times a week this place is great!  You can also get Nigiri pieces from $1 to $2 a piece.  This place is busy and stays busy for a reason it is great for groups if you can get a table.",

    "text": "I'll admit that when I first dined at Ru San's at few years ago, I left feeling as though I had an average sushi dinner.  However, after returning there only recently a few times in the past year, my opinion has changed drastically.  They've doubled the size of the restaurant and offer so many sushi choices and sake drinks that I almost feel overwhelmed.  And by overwhelmed, I mean that I order and order and order because everything sounds good and then I walk out of there feeling like a stuffed sushi roll myself.    For sushi, there are about 10 pages of items that you can order.  I have no idea what they are, but all that I've \"sampled\" have tasted fantastic!   I've even tried items off the $1 and $2 menu that were tasty.  Ever try peanut sushi?  It's a good \"starter\" item if you've never had sushi before.    For a special treat, try a specialty sake drink.  Ru San's offers several different concoctions for $4.95 (formerly $4!).  I started with the Lady Killer (insert joke here) which was a sweet, fruity sake with kiwi juice.  I then got hooked on the Kamikaze and haven't been able to try anything else.  What is it, you ask?  Sake, lime juice, and a splash of tabasco.  Yes, it doesn't sound too appetizing, but it is oh-so-good.  You primarily taste the lime...and then it's followed by a little \"kick!\"  It's not terribly hot, but it does have that \"kick.\"  YUM.  I'm craving one right now.   The atmosphere is a little loud with lots of energy and music, but with enough open space that you won't feel claustrophobic.   The service is a bit slow, but maybe it's just because we've always sat at the sushi bar?  Thankfully, that slower service is only for the drinks.  If you sit at the bar, you order your sushi directly from the sushi chef in front of you and you get served immediately after he's prepared it for you.  No waiting!",

    "text": "After multiple horror stories of having to postpone post-dinner plans and two hour waits for food, I stick to the lunch at Ru San's, and lately just the lunch buffet. I usually try to plan on meeting around 1:30, not as busy, better selection, and a lot of times better quality rolls. but, sometimes I end up at ru san's at noon  with everyone else. the rolls go fast, sometimes dishes stay empty for what seems like forever (last trip a friend just wanted some chicken and broccoli, it sat unreplenished for almost ten minutes - which is a long time during a lunch hour) and at peak times there are a lot of filler duplicates (a plate full of basic tuna rolls next to another plate full of basic tuna rolls covered in sriracha).   but, I get to have my ginger salad, cucumber seaweed salad, a few hot entrees, some nigiri, and my pick of a decent variety of freshly made (and with the way people file through here I assume with relatively fresh ingredients) sushi for $10... even if they decide to smother, cover, and top half the plates with sauces. added bonus (only because of what i've seen at other sushi buffets in town) you can actually identify what's in your roll. no really random filler, and almost all the rolls have fish in them. they even put out a random goliath tempura battered one (you know, the kind that are a test to your sushi eating and mouth widening abilities)  as for service at lunch, they almost always expect you to go to the buffet. the service has been fine when I don't get the buffet, but nothing spectacular. (and the rolls i've ordered off the menu have not disappointed) as far as keeping waters filled, they're usually on top of it.   so go, enjoy mediocre sushi for cheap, and if you're lucky maybe a few people will start sake bombing. (it can be fairly entertaining here)",

Not the case: the Umi was too much, it tasted like taking a bite into a chunk of salt and the Salmon roll was full of wasabi- every piece I bit into brought me closer to tears as my sinuses felt the burn. I absolutely could not taste or enjoy the fish. Bringing me to my final roll, the Yellowtail. All I could taste was rice. Not sure if this was due to my burned taste buds from the Umi and Salmon, or just because their fish is no good. I don't plan to return and find out.",

Do not try the plum wine- yuck. The rolls seemed a bit sloppy. I think they would do much better if they scaled back and took their time when making a roll. They need to figure out tastes and flavors that work nicely together and then they would be set.   Mui Buena - best Calif roll- pretty standard Shrimp Ceviche roll- eh just ok   Spricy Tuna- nothing special Gone with the Wind- a bit ridiculous in my opinion...not a ton of flavor here although interesting concept. It absolutely is a \"whirlwind\" as the menu describes it Crunchy Tuna- most fish in the sushi but it wasnt spectacular by any means. This was the only roll left unfinished.  American Flag Roll- didnt try but it heard it was bad...swimming in a weird sauce that covered every inch (literally) of the plate...just odd.

We'd heard some good things, mostly from the vegetarian blogs and yelpers, and we weren't disappointed.  It was about 8:00 on a Friday night, and the place was hopping - luckily, though, the patio was half empty so we got a table quickly enough.  I have to say I was relieved; although the idea of \"diner sushi\" (as my husband called the inside atmosphere) seems cool, the inside was louder and less subdued than I prefer.  Sitting outside, at least we could hear ourselves think.  Our server was adorable, a young Asian American guy with a super emo haircut and an impish grin.  The sushi could have been shit, and I think I would have still enjoyed myself because of him.  Happily, however, the sushi was pretty decent, mostly because of the large list of vegetarian maki.  We ordered five rolls - the spinach, pickled radish, tempura tofu, sweet tofu, and dried cranberry - and they were all tasty.  Husband preferred the tempura tofu, and I thought the sweet tofu was the best.  We also ordered an appetizer of their veggie dumplings, which were served with a spicy garlicky dipping sauce that was out of this world.  Husband had a beer, and I had wine, and the tab still ran under $40.  For a nice night on a patio with some totally edible sushi, I'll take it.",

After this happening twice I started checking my order before I left. However then I had to wait another 10 minutes for the order to be remade. This in addition to the to-go charge they add to your bill (which is ridulous because I've been to many restaurants that don't ever charge for to go orders).  When we called later about the incorrect order and asked to speak to a manager we were told to leave a number to be contacted by the manager. Well after 3 more calls, we still never heard from anyone.  Also they always try to charge for any \"special sauces\" as they call it. Since they don't have gluten free soy sauce I always ask for something else to dip my sushi in that is safe for me to eat. However they always try to charge for it and I have to argue with the server that since they don't provide an alternative for me I have to get something else and shouldn't be charged for it. Funny how other sushi places that actually have the GF soy sauce do not charge me for any other sauce I request.  Sad to have such disregard for customers with allergies as I'm sure that sweet chili sauce isn't that expensive (I have some at home that cost me less than 4 dollars for a large bottle).  Since there are many other (better) sushi places in town that get your orders to go correct and don't overcharge for dumb stuff (like to go orders and sauces) I'd say I've probably had my last visit here. Shame because the sushi chefs are great.",

On that visit the buffet was nearly devoid of food the entire time I was there. This most recent time, today, the entire buffet was all very spicy sushi covered in salsa or some other red sauce; there was no plain normal non-spicy rolls. What's sushi without a California roll?? I ended up leaving hungry and stopping for a sandwich on my way back to work. Three in a row means I won't be going back.",

    "text": "As a relative newcomer to Charlotte, I try not to visit many restaurants more than once because there are so many places to try in this city. Ru San's is a little different though. My husband and I have been there about half a dozen times and we will continue to return.   Ambiance is strange. Several have commented on the loud techno-ey music they like to blast and I will just say that its not exactly charming. Somehow, we always manage to walk in and get seated immediately, only to turn around 5 minutes later and see a line out the door waiting for tables. I guess we are lucky but we have never had to wait. It's very fast moving (I literally watched a waiter running back and forth across the restaurant on a Saturday night) ...but let's be honest here, you do not go to Ru San's for a quiet romantic relaxing evening.   You go to Ru San's for cheap cheap cheap food that is actually pretty tasty. If you do as I do and stick to the page of $1-$2 offerings and just order a few little things, you can easily walk out of there with a bill under $20 for two, drinks included. Okay if you want more than one drink each, make that $30. Still a very reasonable night out!  Please do yourself a favor and order the fried rice ball. Do it. First of all, its filling and cheap. Second of all, it might be the most delicious little creation ever. I also usually get a couple of tempura veggies (their sweet potato and zucchini are delish) and a couple of their $1 dollar sushi rolls (3 pieces.) That is more than enough food! Their sushi is definitely not the best you have had in your life but you cannot go wrong with 3 pieces for a dollar and it is relatively decent. They have yummy skewers too if you want to mix and match. My husband had the scallops and could not have been happier.",

    "text": "Where to begin. Came in tonight with a party of 4 (Tuesday) and they were on a wait which is totally fine because that means good business. Host asked us to wait about 25 minutes so we caught a drink at the bar. Bartender was really nice guy ( brown hair larger gauges). We were sat and waited for about 8 minutes for our server to arrive. Her first words she barked at us were 'you alright?'. We ordered drinks, a couple minutes later she brought empty glasses and no drinks. Drinks were finally brought and she said 'you ready?'. I stated we'd like to start with appetizers. The two dishes we ordered she talked us out of because they would take too much time according to her (we were in no rush and never tried to give that notion). Ordered the Caribbean breeze  (conch dish) and the golden eye. Terrrrrrrible. Oil soaked hot lamp dried spinach with a couple pieces of pencil eraser, chewy, conch. The rolls we ordered came after. I have a hard time paying $9.00 for a roll that had a 1/4\" piece of shrimp and asparagus in it and 2\" of tempura flakes. Ordered the sesame crusted tuna dish and the tuna was totally cooked (not described as such in the menu). I'm exhausting myself complaining at this point. I've served and/or bartended for the past 11 years (I hate that I even feel the need to use that as leverage about this restaurants review but I feel it's important)  I also worked for an imperial Japanese sushi chef for 2 years ( let me state that doesn't make me think all sushi restaurants are going to be of the same caliber). The whole place just really needs to focus on their food and service skills. Don't treat customers as if their are an inconvenience, and don't serve slop and call it food.",

Went here with the hubby (who shares my same sentiments) for the lunch buffet around 12:30. It was packed so we were excited thinking that since it was so popular it had to be good and after a short wait we headed toward the buffet. Most of the rolls were comprised of tuna and cream cheese. Not really a broad selection. Everything tasted the same or was pretty much the same roll with maybe a variation of cream cheese or avocado. Lots of imitation crab. It was just horrible. The other table looked gross, literally like not cleaned and never refilled. The soup was broth, nothing in it and it was cold. A side of eel sauce is a dollar which I've never heard of before. This was by far the WORST sushi buffet even buffet in general that I have ever been to and I will not go back...ever. The only plus was the service was great, that's it.",

I've eaten there before, and it's been tolerable -- that is to say, loud, but with decent cheap sushi, and good Japanese-style soups and entrees, prepared and served, ironically enough, completely by people of Hispanic descent.  My wife and I ate there last night. She ordered sushi, I had soup. Her sushi arrived about 15 minutes after ordering. She started eating and we waited for my food. (Not a big deal, she eats slowly anyway.) So I waited. And waited. And waited. My wife finished her food, and just about as she ate the last bite, the soup arrived. About 40 minutes after her food. Nearly an hour after ordering. No explanation was offered for the delay, and the place was not busy.  I'll be going somewhere else from now on. Inability to have the entrees come out within 5 minutes of each other is just inexcusable. Especially sushi. Were they afraid it was going to get cold?",

I was drawn to Ru San's because of their veggie sushi menu. Since going a couple times, I have figured out that the weird veggie sushi combinations are not very good. I do not recommend the kimchi roll, nato maki (unless you're actually into uncooked fermented soy beans), Oshinko maki (the pickled radish is so flavorless). Here's no surprise, the most expensive specialty veggie rolls are awesome. Other than that, I would recommend the classics. I.e. sweet potato tempura, avocado, cream cheese.",

I had read on some Charlotte email newsletters that Oku sushi was great and had won some kind of Charlotte sushi award, but I don't think you can compare Rusan's to Oku. Sure, they both serve the same thing, but the indoor ambiance really makes a difference on the dining experience. Oku sushi is more of a hipster sushi place that you'd go on a first date on, and dress up a little more to, while Rusan's really focuses on value of their sushi while exuding classic characteristics of Asian restaurant by having sticky tables and crumbs on booth seats. I wouldn't be scared to come here donned in athleisure-wear and tennis shoes. But hey, I like where their priorities are at (sushi crafting). I guess since I mentioned it with Oku, I have to say by no means would I not take someone on a first date to Rusan's- if I knew anyone who shares the same passion for fish as I do, this would be my go-to date night restaurant. It's not hipster, but it's definitely not trashy. Your chopsticks might be disposable, but the flavor variety and sushi-eating experience is everlasting.   For $10, you can get anywhere from 2-4 rolls at Rusan's, while you barely can get an appetizer at Oku. Service is fast, and their fried iced cream dessert is absolutely delicious. They have so many rolls to try, so it will be awhile before I get tired of coming here. With two medium sized adult asian females, we downed five rolls and a fried iced cream and the bill came out to be $20 each.   I'd take a huge group of friends here, or just eat and catch up with one friend. Either way, I can't wait to go back for the buffet, but since my office is just out of range from here, I guess I'll have to wait for a holiday.",

The wheel of fortune was very tasty but a little difficult to eat as a group as the rice is a thick wheel with the fish and avocado on top and a heaping pile of crab but you'll need a fork to dish it out.

I want to put emphasis on this because he is not responsible for the kitchen's goings on and will be tipped accordingly.",

    "text": "This review is for the all you can eat sushi lunch.  While the sushi was continually stocked, there were not labels as to ingredients (there was a lot of I think that looks like tuna conversations going on). On top of that, there weren't designated serving utensils for each different roll; an issue that irked me because of contamination or folks with food allergies (and irked my friend who is allergic to gluten even more). The sushi wasn't bad, in fact, I was surprised at the size and quality for an all you can eat situation (I expected the quality to be of a much lower caliber). However, the sushi wasn't great either; I was disappointed that I didn't quite know what I was eating (because it wasn't properly labeled); there were far too many tempura flakes; and several rolls had this sticky, sweet (in my opinion, not tasty) barbecue type sauce on top.  I left Ru San's full (an expected all-you-can-eat and sushi combination) but I'm not sure if I would go back when there are so many other sushi places in Charlotte with, in my opinion, better sushi.

They also serve noodle bowls that taste like fancy ramen, but are quite yummy!  I've never had a bad experience with the service, so I can't complain in that department either. All in all, I definitely recommend Ru Sans and intend to keep coming back to enjoy some of the best sushi in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Came here for the lunch buffet. now granted, I know that the quality is most likely a lot different than the dinner plates (i hope). If I wasn't so hungry, I would have walked out after the first plate. Everything tasted mushy and all the same. Little to no flavor and nothing was labelled, so you had no idea what you were eating, even though all the rolls tasted about the same. There were some tempura items, but again, with the batter, you had no idea what is was since there were no labels. Only labels said: \"Out at 11am, Take away by 3pm\". Eww, let's hope it hasn't been sitting out since 11! Some tasted old, some tasted fresher. Nothing tasted especially good at all. I will never waste another dollar on the buffet here, but might give them a chance on dinner ala carte sushi. I hear good things about the sushi here, but I just did not get anything good. I wouldn't rate anything I got over a 4-5, on a scale of 1-10. Wish I had just skipped this place. $11 for that buffet food was a rip-off.  As far as the service, I had a server ask me if I wanted something to drink when I got there, then I had to chase someone down to get a check. I had to ask 2 other servers, and still nobody came. Finally, I got lucky and saw mine walk by. Blows my mind how this place can be so popular and busy. Let's hope dinner is better. I am definitely not a food snob, and I can appreciate good food in a crappy hole in the wall spot, as long as the food tastes good. Im not even scared of sanitation scores. But the buffet food here was virtually inedible.",

I wish they would change up their rolls and try new things more often to new choices to try, but what they do offer is good. Even if someone in your party doesn't like sushi, there are plenty of other good dinner options. The cowboy Maki (all cooked) is a must have for me on every stop. I tried it out when I could only eat cooked items during pregnancy. Staff was always so nice to help me with selections during that time. I see some people on here complaining about the staff and my experience is exactly the opposite. We've never dealt with anyone who was less than professional and they are all truly nice to us. Sure, have they gotten busy and I had to maybe ask twice for a straw? Absolutely. But,  it wasn't thrown at me and no one growled. The only reason I won't go for 5 stars is it is so noisy for me here. I know it's supposed to be all hipster-ish and woo woo, but I don't need it and just wish the dance trance could be turned off at lunch time or dialed down to a 2 at dinners. I'd rather hear my dinner companions. It is a busy atmosphere to begin with and the loud music just makes it chaotic. Over all, love this place and will be seeing you for birthday this weekend!",

The high volume of product that moves through this place ensures freshness. There's a daily lunch buffet, and no doubt it helps, too. (but I've never been.)   They are DEEP FRY / TEMPURA masters at Ru Sans.  Try anything fried - it will be GREAT!  Sit at the bar if you'd like an amuse bouche of cucumber salad.  BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN HERE? Hamachi Kama, or grilled Yellow Tail Cheek. If you LOVE salt water fish - try it!!! It's found in the appetizer section of their menu, is big enough to almost make a meal of... and for less than $8 - what a bargain! ***Cheek cuts are prized among fish mongers - who usually save for themselves.  Don't be afraid to ask the sushi chefs about what is freshest or especially good... they're nice guys. Note: If the cooks make a ruckuss & \"holla\" when you walk in or when your leaving, it's a good thing... your either a nice looking lady or a good customer. Don't be offended - it's their thing to do here.  THE WORST PART OF RU SANS is the service... it can be slow or spotty. This is the why they only get 4 stars. But, my wife & I are regulars & still get poor service sometimes - so don't take it personally.  Enjoy the yumminess!",

Said buffet can be crowded, so be prepared to put your patience to the test as people forget how lines work. That's certainly not the fault of Ru San's, though. Things move pretty fast in this place and the attentive servers keep the buffet fully stocked with fresh platters.  This isn't traditional sushi and sashimi, but I love their creative approach. It tastes good and there's a fair amount of variety. If you have little to no experience with sushi, here's your introduction. My personal favorites are anything involving eel, asparagus, avocado, or tuna.  Try the cucumber salad and the fried calamari, if you go to the buffet.",

Ru Sans is definitely worth a visit if you're new to the Queen City or visiting some friends. Don't expect to be blown away, but its great social food. If you're coming with a big group of loud and fun people that love to socialize, you're in for a treat. Ru Sans is awesome for a night out. Do a couple of sake bombs (if you're into that) or just watch all of the bankers do them. HILARIOUS.  Two words: LUNCH BUFFET. If you haven't had time to experience it, you're missing out. Again, not the most mind-blowing sushi you've ever had, but the array of choices and other non-sushi items is worth the coin.   Service is kind of meh. Lackadaisical at best and certainly not super attentive to things like, oh say.....drinks? You might go thirst for a couple minutes, but fear not.   The atmosphere can get a little bit tight at times. You'll be squeezing in between chairs and tables to make it back to your seat. Also, the bathrooms are tucked behind the kitchen in a long hallway. Pretty cool, if you ask me. Kind of feels like you're part of the kitchen for a hot minute.   Love the art on the walls. Not sure who the artist is, but they are awesome and intriguing.   Definitely worth a try if you've never made it out. Take a bunch of friends, grab a cocktail or do a couple sake bombs and enjoy the semi-glorious sushi.   Cheers, Ru Sans. You're doing what you do rather well.",

I had TEMPURA JAPANESE BAGEL MAKI and tempura battered scallops and sweet potatoes. It was all very good and wonderful.   The service was poor at best. We waited a long time for our drinks, our orders to be taken, our food to come, our dessert, our check. It was a lot of waiting going on so if you're in a hurry, this isn't the place to go. I would have given it four stars because the food really was good but the service was terrible.  I'd go back only for carryout. Maybe I'd even try the buffet lunch.",

It was perfect timing as we beat the crowd and had our choice of sitting inside or outside on the small patio. We went with outside since the weather is so nice. We started with edamame which was a nice fresh start, little strange that they bring you a pile of salt on the plate versus salting it before it arrives but it was good none-the-less. Next, I went with one of their basic rolls that had mango and a spicy thai chili sauce on top, it was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. The other roll I had was the Salmon Fresh Roll with mango and mint, wasn't sure what to expect, but it came as almost egg roll types and there were two. It was also yummy although I would've liked to taste the salmon a little more. Overall good food, nice to beat the rush and consistent service. I'm sure I'll be back again!",

It's just such a poor quality of product. The fish, while fresh enough, has some of the lowest quality of cuts I have ever experienced. Fatty in a bad way, gristle, and poorly sliced. For example: the dynamite yaki has large pieces of octopi in the bake. Super chewy to the point of being difficult to eat. The baked tuna was an off putting gray color, and the salmon well over cooked. Agadashi (sp?) tofu is fried and the coating resembles funnel cake batter. The \"healthy\" seeming nature and intricate flavor of the dish is completely lost on the preparation. I had several pieces of sashimi that were thickly cut, sinewy, and dry/old.  I won't be back.",

We strongly prefer the normal size sushi and aren't fans of paying for a more expensive roll only to find out that it has more rice than the other rolls.  If a piece of sushi takes more than a bite, I'm not as big on it.  I like a roll to encapsulate all the flavors, not to get a little of this and a little of that in two bites.  That being said, wasn't a fan of the 'Dancing Eel'.    Service was definitely sub par and the place is crazy noisy.  We plan to go back another time and will try the outdoor seating.  Also, the protein bomb looks great as it's hard to screw up nagiri.  The Cowboy was okay and the dumplngs were average dumplings.    With better service, extract the noise, and ordering different things, there is still a chance for good food here.  I'm a firm believer in 2nd and 3rd chances.  Check out the photos for what we ate!",

    "text": "Ru San's gets 5 stars for 3 outstanding reasons in the world of sushi restaurants:  1. AFFORDABLE! You can order a ton of food and still not go broke. Sushi as cheap as $1 and $2!  2. QUALITY!  I've been here countless times and  I've never ever had a bad meal. Everything is top notch and high quality. Sushi bar reinforces this: you see all the sushi chefs preparing rolls in plain sight.  3. VEGETARIAN SUSHI!!! Yep, that's right. Ru San's has a huge menu, but my favorite part is the big vegetarian section. Big list to choose from, anything from fried cream cheese maki rolls to tamago egg maki rolls to kimchi cabbage maki rolls. And basically most vegetables you can think of, all prepared in a perfect little roll... heaven! This is such a relief from most sushi restaurants who have ONE vegetarian sushi option (which is usually way overpriced). Most of the veg options are between $2 and $3... awesome!   I really love the Eggplant Sesame Yaki. I usually order this as an appetizer and reserve the leftover sauce as a dip for some of my maki rolls. This dish has cubes of eggplant, seared perfectly, tender inside, light crisp outside. The wow factor here though is the sauce, it's a thick, peanut butter like sauce, tart and sweet and nutty, with sesame seeds.  You've gotta try this!   If you have room for dessert, make sure you order some Tempura Ice Cream. This is basically a block of vanilla ice cream, covered in sweet tempura batter and deep fried. Then drizzled with a strawberry (and sometimes chocolate ) sauce. I'm not sure how they keep the ice cream from totally melting, but this dessert will make your day... heck, it'll make your week. Hands down my favorite dessert of all time.  Cocktails? Order the Lady Killer... kiwi juice and sake. mmm!  Kudos for being open a little later than most places.",

This is a place that even the \"I don't like sushi\" type can go to and not complain that there is nothing on the menu to eat. Very nice non-sushi selection. For the sushi lovers and the courageous foodies........NOM NOM's galore. The selection and price are just to \"YAY\" about and for the times you are so sushi craved the all you can or care to eat lunch buffet ($10.10) is the OMG. I can sit from 11:30am-2:30pm and never eat the same piece twice or thrice unless I want to. They keep the rolls a flowing and change the types every time a new plate goes out. Also get a whole hot bar section as well with calamari, chicken wings, salads, soup, Chinese selections, and dessert.   Great for the intimate date, party group, or even the solo diner. You are always welcomed with a yell by the whole crew:)  Love the NOMMMA-CHAN!!!  :d",

They menu is very extensive and my bf and I got a couple different dishes to explore the menu. We got the chicken fried rice, creamy pesto yakiudon, kiss of fire sushi roll and the calamari. I loved the calamari, it was different than most places. The size of the calamari was a little larger than most places I've been to, but it was so light and crunchy. It didn't feel too fried which I enjoyed. The kiss of fire roll was very good! No complaints there. The fried rice was ok, but for some reason I wasn't expecting it to be amazing anyways. I wasn't really sure about the pesto yakiudon - my bf got that but he seemed to enjoy it. I thought that was an interesting dish! Overall good atmosphere, service was normal and the TV view was good where we were sitting. I'd come here again.",

Half of the soft shell crab appetizer were fried vegetable chunks that shape like crabs. One of the sushi roll served was fried. Plum saki tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup.  If you enjoy fried dishes inspired by Japanese cuisine in large portions, this is the place for you.",

If you've never been there, be ready for a very big greeting when you walk in the door. The service spectacular the value for your dollar is incredible and if I just kept going on about how good their food as I would simply be rambling. I'm hoping they're open on Christmas Day!!!!",

    "text": "I hate to say it but we must go to Ru San's 2-3 times a month. It's essentially the only sushi place we'll go to in Charlotte anymore. It's not high end, but it's great for what you pay for. There's a very casual atmosphere inside their huge Dilworth restaurant with plenty of booth, table, and bar seating. They're almost always busy but the turnover is pretty quick so you shouldn't have to wait all that long. The staff are very kind and attentive, always checking in to be sure you have what you need. The atmosphere is lively and kind of loud, but exactly as you'd expect for this sort of restaurant.   They have a very expansive menu with everything from your usual appetizers, a plethora a regular and special sushi rolls, nigiri, ramen, noodle dishes, and beyond. They have the more traditional Japanese beers and sake along with a good selection of local craft beers on tap and in bottles/cans.   We always order three rolls that aren't actually on the menu anymore, but used to be on their specials. They're more than happy to continue making them for us. The miso soup and appetizers come out quickly and the main courses follow at just the right time. They have more basic rolls, healthier rolls, or gigantic deep fried rolls, depending on what you're looking for. I have yet to have anything that I didn't like. I do want to try their ramen, fried rice, and yakisoba at some point, but I always end up getting the same thing time after time.   They need to replicate this same restaurant in North Charlotte!",

Every roll was some  combination of tuna, avocado, and cream cheese. Two were toped with tempura flakes or crab. Fried or unfried.  None of which were labeled so I didn't know what I was getting but I've had sushi enough to make an educated guess.    Besides that the whole staff was nice and friendly.",

One of my favorite menu items was the seven spiced seared salmon, this was removed years ago and as disappointed as I was, we occasionally went back for other things like the lunch buffet and for their ceviche shrimp maki rolls. This roll was unique to this location but....they removed it.   Anotha one (*DJ Khaled voice*)  Menu can be overwhelming, but there are plenty of people who enjoy a cluster-fck menu as proven by the insane wait time during peak dining hours.   Big fan of Uni and I've never been fortunate enough to have delicious Uni here, it's always been bitter.  If you love sushi rolls with all kinds of stuff in it, you will enjoy this place. So continue to queue up, you have 1 less party in your way.  Note: Party of 4 adults and 2 babies. The babies didn't eat shit. As a 20% tipper, that's fine. Take the 18% instead. Thanks.",

I usually like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt because I understand being busy, I also work in the food industry, so I get it. The last few times my boyfriend and I have come here we have noticed a steady decline in service. The most recent experience my boyfriend and I had been seated by the host and we were not helped for at least 15 mins, when the manger (I would assume) took our order. Then after about 30 mins we saw our sushi sitting at the end of the sushi bar, after about another 15 mins we met our server when he brought one of our two plates sitting at the bar. After about another 15 mins we found our server and asked for our check, and if he could check on the other half of our order, which he looked over and embarrassingly got out plate and gave it to us. Despite the wait and lack of communication between staff, I will continue to dine here. I just hope they can get it together a bit because each time has been worse then the time before.",

There were two servings of sticky rice topped with salmon, and a large sushi roll that was fried and cut into smaller portions. I had inquired about the Braised Pork Belly Fried Rice, and our server said it was her favorite. I am so glad I asked! It was soooo delicious! It comes with a fried egg on top and is drizzled with a sweet mayonnaise sauce. When the guys tried it they were blown away. We will definitely go back.

Unusually large menu with a roll to suit anyone's preference, plus a selection of non sushi items for those that want to go with the group but not eat raw.  Have never been disappointed- consistent and high quality.  If you order a Flying Kamikaze with seaweed salad you will never go wrong.  Concrete interior finishes make it a bit loud and rollicky- request a table outside if you prefer a quieter environment.  Take out automatically includes a surcharge, so be aware when tipping.",

I have seldom met a spider roll I didn't like so when I saw the Angry Crab Roll my insides got all gooey with excitement only to be served overly greasy, soggy crab without any crunch AND it was topped with fake crab AND it had romaine lettuce sticking out like a salad.   Overall, just kind of sad knowing how amazing this roll could have been and the kind of place that makes me upset I did my hair for this.  The one nice thing, and reason it has 2 stars instead of 1 is because my server, Mauro, was very helpful, friendly, and efficient.  Really, all the staff is very friendly, they deserve better.",

The second we sat down we were given waters and greeted by just about every one, they have the friendliest, most welcoming staff. Just seconds later we were given a cucumber crab salad from the sushi chefs, which was delicious. We ordered seven rolls so we expected it to take a while, it honestly took maybe 15-20 mins. We got several different rolls, some recommended by our waiter & the regulars sitting next to us, we regret none of them. Everything was delicious and the experience was even better. I've yet to hear of a bad experience someone's had here. Honestly can't wait to go back.",

The service can be hit or miss and the music is super loud. The ambiance is very eccentric with lots of different lighting and things going on.   My Dishes:  1st time.. Rice and fried veggies- my first time -  Good, wasn't impressed.  2nd time.. Fried tempura- sweet potatoes, zucchini, & potatoes- Delicious! The sweet potatoes were decadent, much better than the regular potatoes.  Egg noodles with Brown Sauce- not so good, one bite and I was done.  Zucchini, broccoli, and onions in a Brown Sauce- incredible!! Loved it!!! Yum!   White rice- very good! Nice and Sticky!!  3rd Time.. *Note to self and everyone else*        Sir Fry = Regular Brown Sauce        Brown Sauce = too sweet, similar to teriyaki  Polly came to the rescue and helped explain how to order what I like next time.   House Ginger Salad- Excellent! Ended up with the Stir fry- broccoli, zucchini, onion- was mediocre this time.    My friend's Dishes:  1st time.. Tuna - A massive plate! She said it's a 10!! She compared it to when she had the Increadible Tuna over seas. Love at first taste!  2nd time..  Salad with ginger dressing- omg good! We both loved it!! The protein platter- It was good for what it was. My friend prefers the tuna better!  3rd Time.. Spicy Tuna- good Scallops- good --Better than the second time, worse than the first--",

So when one of my friends got there, he then told them we needed a table of 7 and he was told that he could not hold a table unless ALL of us were there. So that basically ruined the surprise which was a bummer. But moving onto the food, for appetizers we ordered; the fresh roll which was pretty much like a spring roll. It was really goos but I wasn't a big fan of their fresh roll sauce. We also ordered a tempura green beans, it was just basically green beans dipped in batter then fried. The tempera green beans was served with some soy sauce. I was surprised cause i really liked it! My friend had ordered a mango salad for his appetizer and let us try a little. It was surprisingly good! The mango, strawberries, avocados, salad and salad dressing just went great together! For my entree I ordered, the spicy seafood udon. The serving was more than enough. The aroma of the udon wasn't that pleasant but it tasted good. There was kimchi, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. My boyfriend wasn't so hungry so he just ordered a California roll and had cream cheese added in. The California roll was great! The rice was super soft which I liked. We also had spicy mayo with it, but felt that there wasn't enough spice, all I could taste was mayo.   As far as the service, it was okay. We had to flag the waitress down most of the time we needed anything. But I would still definitely recommend!",

There was a wide array of sushi combinations to choose from. I ended up choosing the Kiss of Fire only because the name of it was intriguing. It was a great sushi roll, with a sweet sauce on top, and there was a nice crunch in the middle. It was 8 pieces so I ordered a side to ensure it was filling.  I ordered the curry rice; which was a fried ball of rice with curry sauce on top! The sauce was amazing, and it was delicious.",

I had hot tea but next time will definitely try one of the Sake mixed drinks. I had my eye on the sake pomegranate. I like that it has other options besides Sushi since my husband isn't a fan. He got the noodle dish with beef which was ahhhhmazzzing! We both loved it. They have a lunch buffet on the weekends for less than 12. Which I hope to check out soon. Outdoor patio seating is clutch for the warmer weather! It was decently busy but no wait and food came out quick! Walked out under 40 bucks w.

Five minutes went before a waitress noticed I wasn't being helped.. She apologized and quickly brought me a glass of water and a menu. She returned two minutes later and asked if I was ready to make an order, which I was.  I ordered the following:  Teriyaki Rice Ball - This rice ball is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It is covered in a teriyaki glaze. It is served hot and is good.  Sea Bass Yakitori - Delectable and melts in your mouth! Be sure to order it (salt only, no sauce).  Nigiri Ikura - Amazing   Nigiri Unagi - Tasty  Nigiri Saba - They gave me a piece that was not presentable and tried to cover it up with some green onion. Regardless, it was delicious!  Calamari Tempura Roll - Calamari is hard to get right and this was spot on! Fried well, was soft, and tasty. If the calamari or octopus at a restaurant is tough and chewy.. they do not know what they are doing !  Grinch Roll - Delicious! Would order again!  Both rolls had an issue with keeping their form; it seemed that the rice was a tad over cooked and was not rolled tightly enough.  The food started to arrive within five minutes! Once I was done eating, I asked for the check and received my check and a complementary piece of cake within two minutes.  The sushi is great, the service was good, and the prices are fair; I will be returning for sure.",

I have been coming to Ru San's pretty regularly for about 4 years now and it feels like it's only gotten better.   Ru San's vibe is no frills, fast and casual, loud, great sushi. Items from the grill (hibachi chicken, rice, etc...) are also notably good, but Ru San's really shines with their specialty rolls that can get pretty interesting. I've tried several and haven't had a bad one yet. The quality of the fish has never been in question. Just because Ru San's prices are stellar, doesn't mean you suffer on fish quality. Try the nigiri and see for yourself (salmon is amazing).   Service is consistently on point, fun, and friendly. The employees share a collective mood of \"we're having a good time, are you?\". Ru San's Achilles heel could be its extensive menu selection. They don't do everything great, but it's a sushi restaurant that offers interesting, fun, and delicious specialty rolls as well as sashimi and nigiri.   Ru Sans hasn't let me down yet and I recommend it to everyone. 4.5/5, rounded up for awesomeness.",

The guy, possibly  bus boy, who was filling up water and taking empty plates was on top of it. Would have preferred if he was our server. There was also a stranger rotten odor when we stepped in the door but I guess we got used to it because it didn't bother us after a few minutes. Not sure I want to even revisit that thought.

Restaurant is very clean and got nice decorating. Costumers are most of office people at lunch time. They open at 11am. Me and my friends were waiting 20mins outside when we came first time. By the way the open, just a lot people come from no where all come in same time and restaurant get crowded quickly. Buffers absolutely satisfied our tummies! Yummy! I love octopus sushi and sashimi. And prices are not expensive at all ! Just $13 for each, I got surprised so much because each time I go to sushi bar, it often cost me about $25 for each person. But their sushi are great! Not bad at all ! I definitely will come back with more friends!",

    "text": "I love the buffet here.  This place is really loud and a sensory overload so its not a good place to go and chat.  It is a place to strap on your feedback and go crazy on some sushi.  They have both cold and hot custom rolls on the buffet.  I personally focus on the nigiri style salmon, tuna, and when they put it out the yellowtail.  Watch out because people hover and grab the good stuff and you have to wait for more of it to come out.  I have put a plat or two full of rice out for collection and nobody complained about it.  I usually double stack the fish from two nigiri style sushi pieces.  If you aren't ordering the buffet I can't stress how much I love the conch: it comes on a bed of crispy vinegar soaked spinach.  It is like salt and vinegar crisps except no potatoes - just warm semi soft spinach.  You can end up spending a ton of money if you order off the menu.  Back in the day I used to come here every week for the energizer lunch but they have since changed it (no more $8 for more hand-rolls than I could ever finish).",

I don't remember a single thing I have ever ordered there, but they were all eaten with delight. They have a selection of basic sushi rolls which are really cheap. The service here is great, even when they are busy. On busier nights, expect to wait quite a bit for a table.  I tried their buffet the other day with my brother. It didn't quite live up to my expectations that I have come to expect from Ru San's. Every single sushi was pretty much bleh. He didn't like the buffet sushi much either. Can't complain about the price though (less than $12 per person).   Ru San's is definitely one of my favorite sushi spots in Charlotte. I'd totally pass on the buffet though.",

However we were sat in an uncomfortable booth (after waiting 20 minutes despite there being nearly a dozen clear tables).   We had to wait another 10-15 minutes for our waiter to come over for the first time. (I guess they were short wait staff that night... but come on, it was a Saturday night). The waiter wasn't very knowledge of the beer options or the menu overall.   Spicy edamame was a bowl of regular edamame with a pile of salt and spices on the side?... didn't really understand that.   The sushi wasn't very good... I've always heard not to expect much from the service, but the food was good. I'd beg to differ. They have about 85 specialty rolls to choose from which I found to just be annoying. Pick a dozen or so and do those really well instead of having a bunch of redundant rolls with weird names.   I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "It has been years since I have had such a poor experience dining out. Unfortunately I took my family to Ru San's to celebrate by sister's birthday Friday night and had a very pitiful experience. After a short wait we were seated in the back of the restaurant which suited us just fine because it was a little quieter than the rest of the restaurant. The ambiance was nice and the sushi we saw coming out of the kitchen definitely had our attention. We waited about five minutes before a nice busser came by and filled our water glasses. We then waited another five minutes before the server came by and took our drink order - 3 Cokes. We saw the timing going on and also took the opportunity to put an appetizer order in. We wouldn't see the server again for 10 minutes, returning with 3 coke cans just as the appetizers hit the table. Still, with the majority of us having worked in the service industry we excused the tardiness and proceeded to order our sushi rolls without complaint - all together 11 rolls for the table. There was a food allergy at the table and the waiter's uneasy responses prompted us to ask a manager if the food we had ordered was ok - turns out had we not done this my brother's fiance would have been in serious trouble. We thanked the manager for his help, and then proceeded to wait for our food. After 30 minutes we began to get a little concerned, especially as the tables on both sides of us who had ordered after our table received their sushi rolls - having worked in multiple sushi restaurants my sister and I knew that sushi is generally prepared FIFO style so after ten more minutes we began to wonder what was going on - we were also down to the last bit of ice in our glasses for some time. After another ten minutes, now 45 in total, the waiter came over to let us know our food would be out shortly and refill our waters. 10 minutes later the manager comes to the table to inform us that the server had only been there 2 weeks and that the food would be right out. I guess the fact that this restaurant cannot adequately train their staff justified the wait.  Then, an hour after we had ordered, our food arrived... well some of it. A total of 9 rolls came out - two of which were different than the ones we had ordered. We had ordered the special pork belly roll, firecracker, Godzilla, and the rich and famous roll, but instead we received some disaster of a roll with asparagus in it. We were skeptical when the rolls came out and asked the server to name the rolls but he didn't have a clue, so we asked to send someone who did. Hungry as we were we decided to at least eat what we thought were the appropriate rolls and hope they brought out the remaining rolls. When the server put down two additional rolls in front of us we were relieved, only to have another server angrily remove them from our table informing us they belonged to the table next to ours. At least that group got some good looking rolls! Finally a manager came over and pointed out which rolls where which, and only a few switches needed to be made. At this point he asked if we wanted the rolls that didn't come out and we informed him that we did not and just wanted to pay and leave. After another 10 minutes, two hours in total at this point, the server brings a check with every roll that we had ordered, even the ones we had NOT received - $30 more than it should have been if we paid full price for the meal. I took the bill to the manager, who seemed aggravated (probably with the server but really is that my fault?), who removed the items that did not come out with the meal. He then proceeded to insult me, a person who never tips less than 20%, and add automatic gratuity to our party of 5. Adding insult to injury, we missed the movie we wanted to go see - overall completely wrecking one of the few opportunities our family has to get together and enjoy a meal. I am not one to stomp my feet and make a scene, but I do expect decent service, accurate orders, and at the very least some accountability for the completely unacceptable service we received.",

There's so many reviews on this place already I'm not sure what to write about that hasn't been said before. The parking here is nice and large, which is good since it can get super crowded. Inside you might have to wait a while for a table on busy dinner nights, but lunch is pretty fast seating.  The lunch buffet is satisfying and cheap. Since this is so close to where I work a lot of us end up here for a quick sushi fix. They seem to change around a few menu items every day for lunch so you won't be too bored if you come often.  The dinner rush is a totally different atmosphere than the daytime. Walked in to booming music, chefs and waiters cheering on sake bombs, pounding on tables, and people trying to be loud enough to have a conversation at their tables. I guess I've gotten old because it wasn't very appealing to me, I prefer sushi in a more toned down environment. The rolls themselves were cheap and some flavor combinations turned out pretty good. There seems to be a lot of fried rolls drenched in mayo and sriracha though. The food seemed to come out in a timely manner even though the place was crowded that night, and we even got some free rolls and dessert!  Well this place's sushi isn't the best but it's convenient for me and cheap. The service is friendly and fast so when I just need a quick bite I think I'll head to Ru San's, but for a nice night out I think I'll pass.",

    "text": "In Charlotte, this is by far the best sushi I have had! Matter of fact I can't think of too many places I've been that is just all around the bomb.  First off, I love how cheap the maki rolls are, but they maintain the quality.  Their specialty rolls are the bomb!!!  Don't feel limited to what is on the menu. If you see something you like you can modify, but be careful it can get pricy when you start building your own.  We usually come for the buffet every Saturday, and when my fiance is off during the week.  We've been for dinner as well.  I prefer their regular menu, just because I can get what I want, but I love the buffet because I can have the best of everything!  I just love this place and can't get enough of it!  If we ever leave Charlotte, Ru Sans will be the standard for every sushi place I try.  As a matter of fact it already is!",

    "text": "I've been to Ru San's many times, but lately they've gone down hill. Friday night was the last straw.  Ordered two appetizers (Calamari & Tuna Tartare), 1 Rock & Roll (Unagi & Avocado),  and three Yakiudons (two spicy and one very stringently requested with no peppers or spices).   Calamari comes out. It's delicious.   Yakiudon comes out piping hot, but all spicy. One gets sent back to be corrected and comes back lukewarm. It was obviously rinsed off under cold water.   Notice I didn't say the tuna tartare appetizer came out. It finally came out 20 minutes after our main course. The entire time, one of my friends sat there picking at cold calamari because we couldn't get a waiter to take his dish back and actually fix it.  When the tuna tartare arrives, it's great, but we let our hungry friend eat most of it. The  incorrect dish was never fixed, but was removed from the bill.  Speaking of the bill, my sushi arrived with it. Seriously, my Rock & Roll came sitting on top of the tray with the check and an ink pen rolling around beside. At a sushi bar, sushi was basically an afterthought.   The food was good as always (except for the uncorrected mistakes) and I'm used to the crowds and the noise. The service however has really started leaving something to be desired. It will probably be a long time before I go back and I hope they can fix it.   It's not like when RuSan's arrived in Charlotte... there are other (better) places to get sushi now.",

    "text": "You had me at sushi. I'm a big fan of the squishy, rolly treat and tend to venture out quite often to pick up my chopsticks. The sushi is fresh, flavorful and rather cheap. I actually come by here more than other sushi places simply for the firecracker roll - I have yet to find one that beats it in Charlotte. At Ru Sans, it's huge and the ahi tuna middle is always cooked perfectly... nice and rare as it should be.   It may sound like a crazy detail but one of the best things about Ru Sans is how tight they wrap their rolls. I've never had ingredients come dropping out, leaving me fumbling in my soy sauce to fish out and pieces and trying to rewrap it myself.   Oh and two words for you: lunch buffet. Take an afternoon and do yourself a favor. The buffet is extensive with one 12 foot table decked out in all sushi. Head toward the back and you find another 12 foot table with soup, salad, duck wings, desserts and anything else they decide to put out. Only downside is the sushi isn't labeled so if you love a roll, good luck finding out what it is. But silver lining to that, the chefs tend to make whatever they want for the buffet, and are constantly making sushi all throughout lunch, so on each trip, you have something new and fresh waiting for you.   The atmosphere is lively. The sushi is cheap. Definitely check it out, especially if you're new to the QC.",

    "text": "I love me Ru Sans.  Its like crazy hibatchi meets sushi.  People are yelling and things are just a blast.  Also, their menu is pretty big which is actually a good thing for once.  The appetizers are decent here especially the mussels.  The sashimi is good and oh did I mention they have a mofoin $1.50 menu?!  You get 3-4 pieces of sushi for a 6 quarters.  As with this, you might think the sushi is trash.  No, actually the sushi is better than some more expensive places in the area. The drink selection is great and for the price you just can beat Ru Sans.",

    "text": "I like Ru Sans. It's good if you're craving sushi and you want something quick and easy. The vibe in there is very casual. The food is good, but it's far from fancy. They have a good selection of rolls and the prices are reasonable. The waitstaff is also quite good.  The lunch buffet is craaaazy. It's a great value, but it's unlike any sushi buffet I've ever been too. It's pure chaos. But they have a lot of sushi and non-sushi options. If you're willing to put up with the chaos, it's a great deal.   I tried the ramen there and although it tasted good, it wasn't authentic ramen. If you're used to ramen in NY, SF or DC, don't order it here. But it's not a bad soup.   I like it here if I want something quick and easy. I'm not blown away, but it's pretty good. Ideally I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I tend to round up. 4 it is.",

Let's just say this one is by far hands down the best sushi buffet in Charlotte. My brother and I decided to break away from China Buffet in Pineville to try this place and we are so glad we did. The buffet is from 11:30-2pm Mon-Sat for $11.95. Not only do they have fresh sushi rolls but they also have soups, salads, spring rolls, fried rice, salmon and other entree on the buffet for you to choose from.  The spring rolls are the best from a buffet that I have had and the salmon was tender and cooked perfectly. Even the desserts from the buffet was delicious!  It was such a great experience that I'm excited for my next visit.   I will say that they get super busy so go as early as possible. We went on a Friday when they open at 11:30 and people were already lined up outside waiting.  When we left around noon, there was lots of people waiting for a table.",

    "text": "Sssssuuuuussshhhhi! All I can say is YUM! I was pleasantly surprised to find this sushi bar in Charlotte before heading to a concert that is in the area. My mom and I went to Ru San's around dinner time (6ish) on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy for a week night. There is nice outdoor seating along with indoor seating and great sushi bar seating. The employees were very friendly and were very helpful when I had any questions about the menu. I ordered a garden salad for my appetizer and my mom ordered the Sea Breeze app. I believe her's was sauteed conch meat and spinach. Whatever it was, she loved it! My salad was a nice start to our main entrees. Together we split the chirashi bowl, the rainbow roll, and the firecracker roll. The chirashi bowl was by far my favorite. The sashimi was insanely fresh and I was surprised to find a couple pieces of sweet tofu. Ahhh, and the hype is True! The firecracker roll is DELICIOUS. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and order it ASAP. Lastly, the rainbow roll, a favorite of mine, was very tasty. Nothing special, but very enjoyable. I really enjoyed my experience at Ru San's and I can't wait to make another trip to Charlotte so that I can have another delicious chirashi bowl! They have a huge variety of speciality rolls so I am also interested in trying some of those. My only compliant about Ru San's was that it did not seem like a very professional restaurant. Some of the employees were joking around and talking to each other across tables. Not that that is a huge problem, however, the quality of food was so high that I expected better from the staff. With that being said, I still highly recommend visiting this establishment!",
