The last time I came here was at 2 AM on a Saturday and I ordered a burger with peanut butter and egg on it.  It was heavenly!  I went back today for the first time in a long time.  It's about noon time, so the menu is quite different from the menu at 2 AM.  I asked our waitress about the peanut butter and egg burger, she says it's called the Memphis burger and that they generally don't serve it until the late night hours.  However, she was nice enough to see if the cook was able to make it anyway.  If they couldn't make it, then I'd have the gyro platter (which is bomb btw).    To my surprise, she brought out the Memphis burger!  I doubt she had any idea how happy I was and how much of my day she made.  I love food and I am in love with this burger!  The sweet potato fries that I ordered to accompany the burger didn't disappoint me either.   The sweet potato fries severed here are the best I've had in all of Charlotte.  I love the environment and the people that run this place are more than amazing.  The service is always polite and this place stays packed.  I consider The Diamond a treasure of my town, even though it's no longer hidden to the larger public.",

Fried Pickle Chips came out and I asked our waiter \"is that Half an order'\"?  He said \"Everything here is served in generous portions\"!  They were very good!  Super greasy so be sure you can stray from your diet for one meal!  I am!     Spaghetti with Meat sauce was very good, great price for the huge portion.  My only criticism was they added Parmesan Cheese to it and it is hard to remove it once it is there!  Fried Pork Chops tasted good and the Banana Pudding was very good!  The \"Slaw\" was very good, like a Cabbage Salad with YAY! No Mayo... YAY!

The clientele and staff are very interesting here as almost everyone was heavily tatted up including some dudes with heavily tattooed faces.  Definitely added to the charm of the Diamond.  The fare here ranges from southern classics like pulled pork, Virginia Ham, and fried catfish to diner classics like dogs & burgers to Greek gyros to Italian chicken parm.  I decided on a small bloc burger \"southern style\" which had chili, mustard, and onions, and slaw on top.  The burger wasn't bad, but was a good value at $3.95.  The wife had the Gyro which wasn't bad either.  Our friend had the Salmon BLT and it was probably the best meal of the bunch.  I would have preferred if they had a little more focused menu with a little better food, but it's still a cool spot to check out if you're in Charlotte.",

I had a single burger and I had the chili option added onto it. I don't remember exactly what the burger name was called but was it good. I suggest to just try everything if you decide to come here. Have a beer, kick back, eat some food and people watch. It's in a very interesting area of the city, and I honestly feel that this is the True Art District of Charlotte instead of the fake NODA.

I didn't want my review to be just another FIGHT THE MAN, SUPPORT LOCAL BURGERS kind of thing (even though I do believe that.) I really did want to keep it about the food, so I waited til I had an experience that blew me out of the water before I spoke up. That happened last night.   First of all, I love how you can barrel up to the bar and instantly strike up a conversation with strangers. I was filled in on the woman to my left's bad date before my Shock Top even hit the bar, while the man on our right offered to buy us both dinner (on someone else's credit card.) I wavered back and forth on a few options, but I made a decision awhile ago that I wanted to try all the new things on the menu before I started repeating, so new things it was.   Guys. Salmon BLT. Giant piece of salmon, covered in some type of magical sweet spicy tangy mayo sauce that drips down your hands, on top of the normal BLT and also baby spinach. (Wait, was there even lettuce on it? I don't remember, it doesn't matter.) It comes with fries and slaw but it doesn't need to- it's a giant. It elicited a \"Whoa!\" and an \"Excuse me while I stare at your food\" from my new friends on either side of me.   All in all, a fantastic experience- excellent food, good conversation with fellow customers and staff, and I kind of want to order a bucket of that sauce to eat with a spoon.",

Interestingly, though the Big Block was my favourite in the old joint, I've been unsatisfied with the new incarnation. I don't know quite where it's going wrong, but the ground beef just doesn't have that velvety, buttery texture I so love -- it's almost as though the meat is handled too much, making the texture go wrong. I've been very pleased with the hot pimento cheese dip, though (it's been a bit on the... less-than-consistent side, let's say, sometimes being a melted soup, and sometimes being mildly warmed up pimento) - I've had it several times, and each time (despite texture changes), it's been rather tasty.   The first time I went, I ordered the custard pie as a dessert, and was advised (about 20 minutes later) that it was no longer on the menu - no suggestions or alternatives were offered. Luckily, that seemed to be a flukey instance, and I've had no difficulties since that trip. Of course, I also haven't bothered trying anything else from the dessert menu, once I wrapped my lips around a spoonful of their 'nanner puddin'. Why would you bother?",

The manager ran outside to greet us at the car, explained the situation, apologized profusely, suggested other places to eat in the area. We let him know we were ONLY there for them and would come back. We did, and I knew the True test was to go for my old standby, the Winky Dinky Dog and sweet potato fries. They were better than they have ever been. I was thrilled. I like the setting much better than the Penguin, and we didn't have to wait (we normally waited 30 minutes at Penguin... at least!)  i plan on going back often. It was wonderful",

Being a native Atlantan, I couldn't care less about this whole Penguin feud thing (see other hate filled reviews by locals).  But I thoroughly enjoyed the Penguin and was told by EVERYONE that the Diamond was way better.  Now I'm pretty sure that it was politics talking.  Maybe this place is just banking on the local support and not taking anytime to ensure the quality of their food & service.  Due to the controversy and publicity,  people are going to pile in in droves no matter how many reviews like this are written, I just hope they don't have the expectations I did.  If you are visiting Charlotte and have to choose just one diner, The Penguin would be your best choice.  Don't concern yourself with all the local drama nonsense, just eat a delicious burger.",

    "text": "The Diamond has been around a long time. Before the revamp and new ownership it was a 2 vegetable and a tea place for 20+ years, in the early 2000's it seemed to become slowly worse over time until I eventually stopped going there. So naturally I was excited to try it again after the revamp. The first time I went it was great, food was fresh and the place seemed clean and updated. I thought I had found love again with the Diamond but was soon disappointed on my second, third and final fourth visit. I am not sure what happened in the following months. The food, specifically the fried chicken and vegetables tasted like they had been sitting around for hours or maybe reheated. The sanitation grade also seemed to hover in the low 90's for a 6 month period. Not sure how that is possible for a place that was just redone completely. If you combine this with the fact that every time we visited there was a wait of 45 minutes it became a bad experience. The Diamond I once knew back in the day had seemed to turn into a tourist trap filled with hipsters that commuted in on weekends just to say they had been there. Basically all fluff and no substance. Where is the quality of The Diamond I once knew?",

We waited for about 30 min before getting a table (which is totally fine...there was a lot of people that day).  We ordered our burgers and requested them to be cooked medium rare (the waitress told me not to worry because that's the way they cook it anyway).  After another 30min, our burgers made it to the table and guess what?  They were well done!  My fries were cold!  Really! Not warm...cold!  I would have gladly complained about it but our waitress never checked on us after we got our meal.  It also took for ever before we got our check which was truly annoying. On the positive note, the food was cheap.  But honestly, it would have been cheaper and better at MacDonald (I cannot believe I am writing this down...I haven't been in a fast food chain for years but it is seriously how I feel).",

    "text": "I moved to Plaza Midwood a few months ago.  I eat out a lot.  I have eaten at the Diamond quite a few times and have found it to be a nice place with nice servers.  You kind of know not to have high expectations in a place like this but it is a funky neighborhood spot.  Today I was out and about with my dog.  He was really hot and I knew I needed to get him some water and out of the sun.  The patio was completely open at the Diamond with only one couple sitting outside.  I found a nice shady table with good people watching for my dog and I.  And then I waited, and I waited, and I waited.  Finally a server came out to check on the other table.  When she didn't acknowledge me I called to her, \"Ma'm...Ma'm?  Ma'm\"  She completely ignored me.  I asked the other couple if I was supposed to go in and ask to be seated.  They said, \"don't worry, she will come back out.\"  They actually gave me their menu.  Another 10 minutes went by.  I was just about to give up when a couple walked in with their little girl.  The mom went in while the dad and daughter sat at the table next to me.  A server came right out and took their order!  So I asked the girl, was I supposed to come in and ask to be seated?  She said well normally yes but she would have someone come out and help me.  A third server came and finally took my order.  I had probably been there 20 min.  By this time I really didn't feel like eating.  I ordered a dessert as I thought it would be rude to only have tea.  I left her a $20 bill for a $6 check to show my appreciation that she at least waited on me when the other two women would not.  I am a really nice person and I feel like I was treated shamefully.  Needless to say, the Diamond won't see any more of my business.  Which is really sad.",

The first few times we went by, it was way too packed to even attempt trying it out... but a few nights ago we went by on a weeknight, had only a 5 minute wait and the food was out super quickly.  I really liked their new menu additions, and the new version of their veggie burger was quite tasty... I added on the pimento cheese which was delish!  Ben was a little sad that they were out of the veggie meat loaf, so hopefully we'll get a chance to go back to try it out before we move away this week.  I loved the decor and the layout.  I like the high booths, and it wasn't so loud an echo-y... I could actually hear our conversation even though the place was packed and the jukebox was blasting :)",

It took a while for anyone to acknowledge me, let alone even ask me what I wanted to drink while I waited for my parents. When she finally did she didn't bring the water until after they arrived and we all ordered. I had to ask for lemon twice. Even though my mom ordered a cheeseburger, and after doing so the waitress asked her \"Do you want cheese on your burger?\", her burger came out cheese less. Fearing she would have to wait another hour for a burger with cheese on it she just had to ask for a cheese slice. My stepdad couldn't finish his grilled chicken sandwich because the chicken was too chewy ( and this man will eat some cooked to death chicken so it must have been bad). My food was fine, but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and an ache in my back since the table behind me clearly had no concern that our seats were connected.   This is noooooooo Penguin, I realize that and so should you, BUT I ( perhaps we) can't help but want at least a little of the Penguin experience here at Diamond. No Penguin fingers or falafel sandwich nor the crinkle fries that fared soooo well with melted pimento cheese or their stellar ranch. Diamond does still offer the grilled pimento cheese and the Dixie chicken sandwich, things that I do get the occasional craving for, and if you go on a day they have a tomato soup get that with a grilled pimento cheese. Super yum. However, the fries aren't great and various other things on the menu that I have tried leave a lot to be desired. For some reason the fried pickles don't even taste as good. Will I go again? Probably, since I seem to forget how meh my previous trips are until I experience it again. I wish I liked it more, maybe they need to reevaluate some of their staffing decisions ( the hostess was a bust too). Maybe I'll stick to take-out.",

Now, as those restaurants steadily close, it is hard to find diner food that is not just bland hamburger and fry fare. The Diamond has plenty of good hamburger options, but like all True diners, that is not all they specialize in. There are also a healthy amount of salads, sandwiches, blue plate specials and regular dinner entrees to make your mouth water. And if the taste seems familiar, a lot of folks working at The Diamond came from The Penguin before it closed down. I love this place and eat here often. It's not always the easiest parking situation, but the food is great, the staff is friendly and that's the most important part, right?",

It was a total disappointment which I was specially surprised since the waitress recommended this. I ended up eating only the sides but paid for more than that.

Be real people; new location/new huge menu/computerized ordering vs the old paper tickets, plus trying to get a gauge on staffing/food ordering is a big deal that takes time to work out. If any of you hipsters remember the launching of the old Penguin in '00, it was much the same as this for a few weeks. If this is still happening a month or so from now, then Houston, we have a problem...  Also Brian and Jimmy would like to hear about problems you have there, but going this route is the cheapshot way to do it; I'd venture to guess none of these complainers actually vented all this angst to anyone while they were actually IN THE RESTAURANT!..theres NO WAY you sit there w/o food for 75 minutes if you've contacted a manager or your server.

The fried pickles and burgers are just as good as (if not better than) I remembered them from around the corner. Rest assured, all your old favorites are here. But the menu also has a lot of delicious newcomers. I opted to go with the meatball parm sub. The meatballs and sauce were both nicely seasoned and the cheese was melted to stringy deliciousness on the top. Don't expect a side of fries, but hey, there are enough delicious sides available to order (ex: crab dip, pig wings, fried pickles, etc.) that you won't miss the \"plate\" style combination.  The inside has been redesigned in a way that can only be classified as kitschy-chic. Bright blue vinyl booths (though there aren't a whole ton of them so keep wait times in mind when if you go right after they open), oversized utencil art, and vintage wallpaper all await you inside The Diamond along side a lot of familiar faces.  I want to see how they run with a full crowd and sink my teeth into some more of the sizable menu before I go tossing around a fifth star, but so far it looks like The Diamond is ready to knock it out of the park!",

We barely had room on the table, but no one offered to take our empty plates from appetizers, I was just told to keep the extras because the boy wasn't dealing with the chef to take them back to the kitchen.   The waitress was slow and dumb. That's also being nice. I'll just leave it at that because I want to be semi-nice.   I'm hoping that my issues were just quirks of it being new.

The food was as good as we all expected it to be and I must say that eating it was kind of like being reunited with an old lover.    The restaurant was out of three menu items by the time I arrived for dinner and, hey, while one of those items was what I wanted to eat, I can understand running out of something that is really freaking good.  The waitress informed us of the depleted items as soon as we took our menus, but it was the last thing she did right all night.  I will not fill this review with slanderous detail about how she'd disappear for inordinate amounts of time or how she failed to communicate a very important piece of information that could have saved my friends a lot of time that evening.  I will say that her poor service ruined what could have been an otherwise happy reunion with some food that I sorely missed.    I'll be back to Diamond in the very near future, as I'm sure all of the kinks will be ironed out.  I'm hoping that a new wait staff will have the raw efficiency of the old Penguin staff.

Guess what?  It was worse.  The menu available was the same as the first time and our server indicated that only two vegetables were safe for vegetarians, according to the cook, despite what the online menu says.  So either they are intent on lying to the vegetarians or they are going to entirely revamp their cooking when the new menu comes out.    Not pleased.

The booths are a little tight, and i'm not that big. Maybe it was just the booth we were in.   I ordered fried chicken, mac & cheese, and fries. The chicken was incredible! Very juicy, great crunchy skin, it was some of the best I have had. Mac & cheese was great too! Wife had the ham steak with apples and she loved it.   My only bone to pick with this visit was our server. He just seemed like we totally ruined his afternoon by sitting down. The whole time I felt we were inconveniencing him. And i'm not talking in the \"old school Penguin wait staff \"rudeness\"\"(ya know being short b/c they are busy and running around like crazy, not because they don't want to be there) But he was just miserable.

    "text": "We went there for dinner one weekend. Firstly, the parking lot was small and crowded  and kinda looked like an alleyway. The spaces weren't clearly marked and cars were parked wherever they could fit. We walked around front and the entrance was dark and unwelcoming. The place was crowded and we took that as a good sign. The seating seemed a little crowded and it was kinda hard to maneuver to our table without bumping into other diner's seats. The place was loud and even though we were seated in a booth in the corner we had to shout just to hear each other. The waitress was friendly and quickly took our order. While we waited we started looking around at the decor and noticed that the place wasn't all that clean. We saw dust and cobwebs on the fan and wall decor. The wallpaper seemed kinda dingy too. I noticed that the couple across from us had left and a worker was \"cleaning\" the seats. After he finished cleaning I noticed huge crumbs or particles of food still in the seat. The next thing I knew, a waitress brought a couple to that table and seated them. They sat right on top of the leftover stuff. Gross!!  For our appetizers we ordered the \"Pig Wings\", which were bite-sized pieces of fried pork served with a dipping sauce. I didn't enjoy them at all. They were dry, leathery, and flavorless. For our entree I ordered a small Block Burger and my date ordered a Winky Dinky Dog. The burger was really good and the beef was fresh, moist, and flavorful. My date enjoyed his Winky Dog. My burger didn't come with fries so when the waitress came back around, I ordered fries and she said she would bring them. Well, she didn't come back until 15 minutes later and by then we had finished eating. She never even mentioned the fries again. She just gave us the check. We paid and left but overall we felt a little disappointed by our visit. The one saving grace was the burger and hot dog. Everything else pretty much was unimpressive.",

    "text": "I've been told by so many people that this place was amazing. But because of my experience I refuse to go back.   I came here for lunch with my girlfriend to try it out one day. We ordered the fried oysters as an appetizer. They were hot fresh and great. After eating that oysters I was excited to get my entree. I ordered a philly, my girlfriend ordered a burger. After the waiter came to take away our plate from the oysters he returned 10 minutes later with our check BEFORE we even got our entree. It felt like a rude jesture. We told the waiter we weren't ready to pay because we hadn't  even seen our entrees. He apologized and took the check back. We figured it was a simple mistake and brushed it off. We saw a tray placed on the order window which we assumed was our food. A waitress proceeds to grab the tray then walks around the tables passes our table then goes back to the kitchen window and leaves it there. It's been more than 20 minutes since our waiter took out fried oyster plate so we ask him how much longer on the food. He runs to the kitchen window and grabs the food that was sitting and brings it to our table. That was a HUGE RED flag in my mind. We touch our food and it's cold obviously. We tell the waiter he takes it back to the kitchen and returns. This is what made me flip bricks. The jack offs in the kitchen decided to microwave my girlfriends burger and throw my philly back on the grill and top it off with cheese. Are you serious? My girlfriends burger tasted like crap and was way over cooked. The veggies were wilted and watery. My philly...... dear God my freaking philly was drowned in cheese and the bread was hard and the the meat was absolutely disguisting. I was beyond upset and no longer had an appetite. If you let an order sit you should remake it instead of trying to play it off. We didn't pay for our food obviously. The manager compt our whole mean with no hassle which was nice and expected. Overall this experience left a awful taste in our mouths and we will not be going back. Ever.",

    "text": "Normally great... but things have been going down hill. I've been eating here since they reopened and for the most part haven't had problems other than when they run out of veggie burgers. However, last night was the nail in the coffin for myself and a few friends. We took my mom there for her birthday at her request and had some of the worst service I've experienced...I know it's becoming an unfortunate habit for me to get bad service no matter where I go. So we wait 20 minutes for a table, order some drinks and Apps - the waitress must be hard of hearing because she had issues with taking our orders and kept asking what we said and bringing the wrong stuff to the table. We got Pig wings, Fried Pickles, and Disco Pimento Fries - it took 30 minutes for three plates of fried food, everything was good but they forgot the gravy on the fries so we had to send them back and they were soggy. Dinner took another 20 plus minutes and three trips to serve 5 of the 6 guests. My friend's burger made multiple trips around the restaurant while I waited for a condiment that should have been on my veggie burger. By the time I got it my food was cold, and the fries weren't crispy to begin with. My mom's food was lukewarm but she was a good sport about it. When my  friend finally asked where her burger was she was told it was coming, and then the waitress asked her what it was that she ordered. Then a burger came, the wrong burger - hers was the one making laps around the diner. So they bring her that very burger, not a fresh one, but the one that has been to every table but ours and is now ice cold (they did comp it), but Jeeze, make a fresh burger!!!! Since I'm moving soon I am disappointed that this will be my last memory of one of the places I loved best here in Charlotte.",

Don't get me wrong, I like my hamburger done but when its over cooked it gets dry and that was the case here the other night.  Still pretty tasty when you're half buzzed!  The fried picks were tasty as usual and I was very surprised at how good the hushpuppies were.  They were a favorite at our table.  I also had a bite of a corn dog that was really good.  They use their own batter for the corn dogs instead of the generic frozen stuff.",

I ordered the Diamond Boy and it was pretty good but I think using a hamburger bun in lieu of a Texas toast style bread is a mistake.  It's basically a swiss/mushroom patty melt.  It was good, no doubt.  I ended up getting the cole slaw side and it was a bit too vinegar based for my taste.  Cool recommendation from our waiter were the \"Pig Wings\".  The saying \"when pigs fly\" comes to mind, well apparently this place is keeping that from happening because they are serving them up chicken wing style as an appetizer.  They were actually really good and I would certainly order it again.    My girlfriend and I were here with a few friends late night dining and the place was packed so the food came out pretty slow but nothing to get upset about really.  Super nice waiter was at the table checking on us frequently but not overboard annoyingly as can happen sometimes.  Diamond Restaurant is just that a diamond in the rough IMO.",

Overlooking just a couple things that I will get to later, I'll say the food was dynamite!  My only woes were the cornbread, the mac and cheese which was more mac than cheese and the noise but then again, hipster head quarters is right down the street. Our waiters shirt was about 4 sizes to small and I'd say facial hair is faux pa because they could easily fall into the food. The mac and cheese needs serious improvement as the noodles with sticky and the cheese was was, well, where was the cheese? Not much in it at all. Someone needs to get this place a corn bread recipe or learn to store cornbread so it stays soft.   The Meatless Loaf with Mashed Potatoes was knee buckling and the creamed squash was absolutely heavenly, which was unexpected.Once again, My guy had the Veggie Black Bean Burger and it was huge, tasty and  very satisfying. The flavor was unbelievable and the price, very acceptable and the warm, soft bun was appreciated. Most places the bun is cold and stiff. One con only was there was no pickle on the side and that's a diner must have! I can not stress how much I was impressed by the Meatless Loaf though. The portions for the price with down right generous and I could not finish my plate and I wanted to and had to force myself to stop eating! 5 dollar pitchers of Shock Top was completely acceptable too.",

Mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable.  Collard greens was under cooked in my opinion and I have had better home cooked greens than that.  Cream squash was OMG kinda not good.  It was so watery, for a moment I thought I had ordered cream OF squash soup.  Waitress wasn't too friendly at all.  I doubt it's a surprise that it's going to be busy at dinner time, so why not put that frowny face away and put a freaking smile on!

We started with pickle chips which were sliced a bit thicker than I remember at the Old Penguin- but the taste of the ranch and batter was the same. The 1/2 serving was huge- so share!  For my meal I went with the Greek Po'boy which was a lamb burger, feta, and tzatziki with french fries, slaw and a pickle.  I found it odd that the po-boy was more of a burger, it wasn't served on a hoagie although it was awesome taste-wise!  He had the Southern Style burger with fries. He enjoyed his as well although one order of fries could easily have sufficed for us both!   I  do think service was a bit on the slow-side although our server was busy. I ordered an extra side of tzatziki and had to remind her about it because I was already half-way finished with my sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't charged extra for it though. Overall the Diamond is a solid place for a meal! ( just an fyi They also have veg-friendly options)",

The Diamond has lots of local drama drama in how it came to be (and how The Penguin came to suck). For more reading! Look at others' reviews or google it.  Now to focus on the place itself: comfy booths, dim lighting, and very popular to the alternative-sort of people without Charlotte. This place is one of the Must-Go's in Plaza Midwood.  The food is as diner traditional as they can get (while still adding a modern flourish). I have the Jumbo Soy Dog which came with meatless chili, mustard, onions and coleslaw on it. I was pretty impressed and quite happy.  Even though much of the menu is barred off to do due to my veganism and hatred of greasy food, I'll definitely be back!",

It wasn't very busy when we went here after grabbing libations at Common Market nearby and were seated promptly by a friendly waiter.  We decided to share a whole order of fried pickles and it came out hot, crunchy, and absolutely delicious! There was way more than I expected though, in the future a half order will probably be more than enough for sharing. Then came the salt and pepper catfish with fries, hushpuppies, and an interesting vinegar coleslaw. I'm not usually a big fan of catfish so I don't know why I ordered it but the batter was crispy and flavorful and pretty satisfying. The fries were crispy, and hot, in the words of Tonya P. I would rate them as French Fry Barometer: Hot! Vinegar coleslaw I have never tried before and it was yummy! I think I might even prefer it to regular coleslaw!  This is a great neighborhood place, and located in a fun section of town. I just wish it was closer to where I lived but then again that's probably a good thing since I might become fat living near here.",

    "text": "I must begin this review with an embarrassing confession:  Despite the fact that I am a Charlotte native, born and bred, I have never been to the Penguin. Nor, until the visit described below, had I ever had a fried pickle.  There, I said it.  The past couple years, I've kept meaning to go to the Penguin and eat fried pickles, but I've always been put off by their post-Guy-Fieri explosion of crowded-ness (If only the entire world could be post-Guy-Fieri, but that's a conversation for another day).  Anyways, I digress.  This isn't a review of the Penguin: it's a review of the Diamond, another Charlotte institution that I waited far too long to visit.  After the rumpus about the Penguin's ownership settled down, I decided an outing to the Diamond was in order: it's now run by half of the Penguin's old ownership team, and I hoped the wait would be more reasonable than the Fieri-hailed restaurant mentioned above.  We arrived and were seated immediately.  +1 for the Diamond.  We started with a half order of fried pickles, which was more than enough for two people and quite tasty. I am not sure I am going to make fried pickles a regular part of my diet, but I'll certainly order them again.  For my main course, I ordered the Po' Boy Greek burger.  Now this ... this was delicious.  A lamb patty stuffed with feta? Just the right amount of saltiness and tang?  If you are looking for these qualities, you must try it.  The fries were good as well.  The only small culinary disappointment was the slaw on the side, which could have used some more vinegar or spices.  Our server looked like Amy Winehouse, but she was politer. The decor was 50s kitsch, which was fun.  I fully intend to return.",

And no, I'm not going to hash out a review about their history and challenges that resulted in the final product...y'all can research that yourself. I'm here to talk about the food! And the service :)  After waiting it out a few weeks, hubs and I finally rolled into the Diamond at 6:15 pm on a Monday night in hopes of avoiding an astronomical wait. And, cha-ching! No waiting. Our server Jason got to us pretty quickly and set us up in a booth with drinks within minutes. The interior of the Diamond is really great - shiny, vinyl booths, kitschy wallpaper, sweet sized bar near the back. I really dig the color scheme - the place looks wonderful.  A couple things to note...they were out of many items. I realize they are still going through some kinks and, unfortunately, it shows. The menu is quite large and I can only imagine how tough it's been to gauge inventory with long lines and a hefty menu. Since a good deal of the pent up anxiety about the Diamond revolves around the food, here's what I indulged in & how it fared:  Fried pickles: 3.5/5: Tasty slices of pickle-y love & a very generous portion - even for a half size. Yes, that's $3.95 for a boatload of fried pickles. These little babies came out piping hot with a side of ranch. My only gripe? The breading was pretty plain and the ranch was fairly thin. A little spice would kick this dish right up to 5 stars for me.   My meal: I chose the quarter fried chicken plate, a steal with two sides and your choice of biscuit, cornbread or yeast roll. While I was yearnin' for some cornbread, they were out of it. *cries* Oh well, I went with a biscuit, green beans and a baked sweet potato.   Fried chicken: 4.5/5: This rivals my grandma's fried chicken. Crispy, hot, perfectly seasoned with just a touch of grease. Hey - it's fried chicken...a little grease is good. The meat was juicy tender and freakin' delicious.   Green beans: 1/5: I barely stuffed two beans in my mouth. These tasted straight out of the can with a pound of salt added. Serves me right for ordering a non-fried veg.   Baked sweet potato: 4/5: Yes. It was a baked sweet potato! No butter required.   Biscuit: 3/5: A good biscuit, not a great one. I have to admit that I compared this biscuit to Dish's and it just didn't quite measure up. Nevertheless, the Diamond swings a soft biscuit and it went well with the fried bird on my plate.   I vacillated between 3 & 4 stars for the Diamond, but ultimately went with 4 stars because of the value you get from the food, the fun & vibrant ambiance and overall potential. I'll be back!",

The burgers are dryer & crunchy on the outside, not as good as they used to be.  I really like the addition of the vegetables, I got mac & cheese which was good but lacked oomph & the sweet potato fries were tasty but kind of dry without something to dip them in.  I definitely want to come back (months from now when it's died down!) & try some of the greek food.  They were out of most of it when we went.    now, here is where my love for The Diamond stops.  I am not kidding when I say that it was the worst service i've ever had.  Our server was awful, it took ages to take our order & she got it wrong.  She was also sick (sneezing into her elbow, wiping her nose), pretty gross.  It took her 30 minutes after we were seated to take our order, our fried pickle appetizer took 45 minutes to appear (by then I was ready to chew my arm off!), my order was wrong & they forgot part of another order.    Cut to the end of the meal & we were informed that the internet was down & they couldn't take credit cards. We were told it would be a few minutes.  15 minutes pass, still can't pay, a new set of customers have already taken over our table and we're still waiting.  another 15-20 minutes pass and we still can't pay.  We had to send someone to the Common Market to get cash because the wait was getting ridiculous.  Our server informed us when we asked if they had any other way to take credit cards or if the manager would comp our meal for waiting 45 to pay told us we were being uncool.  They did eventually cut our bill in half.   I know The Penguin's thing was to have not so friendly waitresses, but at least they were unfriendly and efficient, she was just rude.    I really really wanted to love The Diamond, but I won't be going near it for a few months.  They have a lot of kinks to work out.",

It was hard to pick from the great options but I ended up getting the Winky Dinky Dog and the Small Block Burger.  The chili and pimento cheese on the Winky complimented each other nicely and came together for a really tasty dog. I also requested pimento cheese on the burger and I'm glad I did.

This atmosphere is fine with me though especially when I'm not in the mood for a fussy production. Love that it has a full bar, unlike Mert's which is just wine and beer.  The service has been solid both times I've been there. Nothing over the top, but the servers always come to me right away and check on me during my visit.   Oddly enough I've never had an issue finding a space smack dab in front or on the side, unlike other patrons.  Today was my cheat meal so I ordered tons of carbs! :) Here's a run down: --Mac n cheese - delicious and very pleasing to this Southern, Alabama girl. --Hushpuppies - standard, yummy. --Corn muffin - dry, I was disappointed  --Black eyed peas - had no flavor at all but they were still tasty. I just added a little salt. --Collard greens - good, seasoned but not too much. --Peach cobbler (not pictured) because it was bad and I sent it back. No flavor. It was like mush. The server asked if I wanted to get something else, but I declined bc any time I send something back (which I rarely do even if I don't like something), I never get anything in its place because I don't want the cook to spit in it. Y'all KNOW what I'm talking about lol! Not that they would do that at Diamond though. :)  Overall decent experience but nothing to write home about.",

Other than the people waiting to get in non stop smoking cigarettes, which I know the restaurant can't help, it was an awesome patio.   For food we started off with the pimento cheese dip served with crackers. It was delicious but a tad greasy. I ordered the double cheeseburger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've had in a very long time. The patties were thick and juicy. I also had a side of fries which was huge, you could easily share them. We also had a veggie burger which I was told was made there. It too was one of the better veggie burgers I have had! We also had a side of broccoli salad that tasted like cole slaw, it was nice to have something different and fresh.  All together a very good meal! I would recommend.",

    "text": "I dare you to think about The Diamond without also thinking of The Penguin. Seriously, go on, try. You can't. The situation that went down at the end of The Penguin's last life turned into that big hubbub which rolled nicely over into hype, hope and hyperbole of how The Diamond would save us all, forever - or at least for lunch and dinner. Time passed, The Diamond doors and shutters stayed frustratingly closed even though we KNEW something was going on. I think by the time they posted on their Facebook page on Valentine's Day the hint that this would, at long last, be THE week of arrival for our blue-hued savior, the line was forming from the front doors down to Elizabeth.   I was lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to attend a preview night before the opening so I could go forth and spread the word of Brian & Jimmy. We were the first in the door on Wednesday night and I got that nervous feeling like I'd had too much coffee and snuck into a movie. I ordered the legendary Full Hemi and fried pickles - is there any way to start this food affair without a burger? - and I was reasonably pleased. The burger was a bit different, most noticeably that it held together. Everything else about the food was just like I remembered The Penguin. I snuck in again on Friday on the official opening day and had an experience much like I used to get midday at that legendary dive; sitting up at the bar counter and chatting aimlessly with someone from a much different walk of life from us Plaza-Midwood hipsters while I noshed on (yes, another) burger. I caught a glimpse into the kitchen in back and made eye contact with my neighbor, one of the cooks - he gave me a perfect look of exasperation and mimed pulling out his hair. Opening day (and week, and month) at the Diamond was in no way a walk in the park.  I heard and read quite a few reviews of really bad service in those first few weeks. Honestly, I'm not too surprised - the place was in such a panic in the beginning there that I'm sure the staff had absolutely no clue how to keep up. That doesn't excuse the bad service, which there probably is, but I can understand being overloaded operationally. It's rough and I really do hope that they can get it under control. There's so many new things on the menu that the staff, though experienced from the bird, has to learn how to manage a whole new level of complexity in the kitchen. They will get it, eventually. The hype didn't give them much time to get up to speed before they became The New Place To Have Lunch and Dinner for everyone.  I've branched out a bit on the last few visits, and I've found many things on the menu that were decent to great. The meatloaf was okay, a little crunchy for my tastes; the sides were awesome (especially a killer mac 'n cheese) and the fries were a heck of a lot better than the Penguin's bag potatoes.   See, there I go again. Talking about the Penguin. How can you not?  The real \"a-ha\" moment I had was my visit last night with Danielle - I got a Small Block with bacon & cheese (old habits die hard) and she ended up with the Po' Greek Boy platter. My burger was the best I'd had there yet (I think they're starting to get the hang of the new recipe) and the fried pickles were exactly as crisp as I hoped for. But then I took a bite of the Po' Greek Boy and it was like a switch flipped in my head. This was an awesome new flavor to me: lamb patty with tzatziki sauce and some fixins on a bun. Maybe you have had it, but I definitely never had, and my taste buds did that little happy dance you'd see in cartoons. I suddenly could not wait to try the new ideas that Brian & Jimmy mixed up for The Diamond's menu. Service is rough right now, yeah, but this is an experienced crew that took a crummy dive and turned it into a legend. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more five-star reviews months or years down the road. So as I chewed and savored the Po' Greek Boy aftertaste, I reached my thesis statement for this review, words with which I hope you will swirl around in your mind as you contemplate The Diamond:  The greatness of The Diamond lies not in the nostalgia and revival of its past; the greatness of The Diamond lies in the promise and potential of its future.  So chew on that! I'll be back.",

    "text": "I've hesitated to write this review until I ate here at least 3 times.   The first weekend they were open, I ate the Race Track Dog and fries. It was very bland and at that time they were slicing the bun down the middle so essentially it was just 2 pieces of bread on each side of the hot dog. They have since gotten normal buns. The fries were delicious but I wish they were crinkle cut.      The next time. I tried the Fried Catfish plate. Now, usually, you can't mess up something like this but the breading sure did. I don't know if they were having an off night  but the breading for the fish and the Fried Chicken was very bland. You could taste the flour in it, it's almost like they didn't flavor it enough or fry it long enough to cook it out. The hush puppies were nothing to write home about either.       The next few outings consisted of their Small block and Pig Wings ( that everyone has been raving about) .  The Burger was awesome. Plain with cheese because that's how I feel a burger should be. Just so you can taste the delicious flavor of the meat complimented with a slice of melted cheese. The Pig Wings, were what everyone claims they are...AMAZING! I LOVE any type of slow-roasted Pork and these definitely lived up to the hype. I think it has been the best addition to the repertoire of Bryan and Jimmy yet. I only wish they served a non-vinegar based BBQ sauce with it. You only have the option of Honey Mustard or the above mentioned sauce, which I've never been a fan of.       Now, I've had an obsession with plain potato chips ever since my first bag of Lay's at an early age so I'd like to consider myself knowledgeable in this area.   The Diamonds' homemade version was delicious, better than I've ever made at home that's for sure.       I'd give this place 5 stars on atmosphere and drink specials alone but the not so great experiences with the food knocked it down to 4.              For a hangout spot, I believe it will be just as great as what the Penguin was, especially late night. It already is for me.  Who can beat High Life Pitchers?? They'll be getting my money every week from here on out.",

But $1.50 Rolling Rock Tall boys and $5 shocktop pitchers paired with homemade chips and vidalia onion sauce was enough to satisfy us that night.  My brother and GF got salads which they both really enjoyed.  When my chips ran out of dip, the server gladly offered, on her own initiative, to get us another one.  All-in-all a fun time.

    "text": "In a word... Fantastic!  Like a Phoenix from the flames, The Diamond has resurrected, reopened and is sparkling brighter than she has in many a year!   Given a chance I predict that this little iconic jewel will be a big hit in Plaza Midwood neighborhood. I was there for lunch on 2/18 and what a joyous sight to see the place packed and a line out the door!  I ordered the fried catfish sandwich, which came with a vinegar based slaw, hush puppies and French fries.  I was quite pleased with the food, but what was even more delicious was the nourishment for my soul.  I was a huge fan of the original hole-in-the-wall Diamond, and it made me so happy to see her all polished up and back in action.  Everything new, fresh and lovingly put together.  I couldn't help but take a peek at the men's room while I was there.  Low and behold if it's not all gussied up too. (Previous Diamond die-hard fans will no doubt remember how truly disgusting the original restrooms were.)  Jimmy, I can't give you 5 stars today, because obviously you guys were overwhelmed by all the positive energy returned to you on the official grand opening day, but you can bet I'll be back to give you lots more practice time!  Bravo!",

    "text": "I have to say after my last few visits I believe the Diamond has finally hit its stride. The expectations set months before they even opened were never going to be met during the opening nights, or weeks, but I think it has finally earned all 5 stars in my book.  The Diamond has been putting out consistently good food, the expected amount of service, and a nice atmosphere. I may only eat about a third of the items on the menu (so far, there's always time to branch out later) - but they're awesome. And most importantly - do I think they could do anything to improve my staples? Nope, I love them just the way they are. Service ranges from amazing to par, but I never find myself searching for my server. Food usually arrives after a minimal wait (especially if you throw your app order in before your main course - and seriously, get the pig wings), waters are filled (or you're asked if you'd like it filled) when around 1/3 is left, you're checked on just often enough, and the overlapping of servers and runners gives you speedy service and the ability to get in and out as quickly (or as slowly, sometimes the booths and conversation just suck you in) as you'd like.   No, it's not a 5star mind-blowing taste explosion, it's a 5star you just walked in the door from a crappy day at school and you can smell your mom's making your favorite dish for dinner. It's comfort food, and it's done right. (without the mandatory glass of milk or cleaning your plate before dessert)",

I read it was always slammed and the service sucked when it first opened...So I wanted to let them iron their issues out before I tried it.  I finally made my maiden voyage into their cozy booths last Friday....  I had an enjoyable experience overall.  The waittress was attentive, but nothing like the overbearingly quick service at the Penguin.  I think people were knocking the service because they were so busy when it was just opening.  The food was also similar to my experiences at the Penguin.  I got the Full Blown Hemi, southern style and it was just as good as I remembered.  My girlfriend got the pork sandwich, which was good.  The gravy fries w/ Pimento lacked an ample amount of gravy, but maybe I just got a skimpy batch.  The gravy was kind of runny too, not as thick as what I was thinking it would be.  They were OK, but most food is good after a few beers in your belly.  I like how they have an expanded menu with a Greek twist and will have to try something new next time.  I'm just glad the burger still tastes similar and I can support the guys who made the Penguin what it was before the whole franchising debacle.",

    "text": "Being new to Charlotte, I'm not sure I fully understand the whole history of the Penguin/Diamond fiasco, so my rating is based solely upon what we ate on the night we visited.  First off, the clientele is ahhh....interesting.  As we pulled up, the crowd exiting looked like they were surely leaving to get a fix somewhere.  Made me a little leary.  Then the hostess, a cute girl, had pretty much full arm sleeves on both arms.  Everyone in sight was dressed in head to toe black and clearly spent enough on tattooing to fund a small nation.  Given that we just hopped out of our minivan and had two young kids with us, I wasn't too sure.  But, the more I looked I saw a few polo shirts in the crowd, heard a few kids squawking and felt a bit at ease.  Near the end of our meal, an older couple was seated next to us looking like they had skipped the country club mixer to eat some grease at The Diamond - she even asked for the wine list (ha!) - so it's definetly an ecclectic blend.  Anyway, on the good stuff.  I LOVE fried pickles.  The Diamond's pickles were awesome!!!  Lightly battered, very tangy pickles, served hot out of the fryer.  A fried pickle is all about the pickle after all, so you better use a tasty one.   The only problem is that the ranch dressing they served them with was downright NASTY!  It was way too thick - pretty much the consistency of straight mayo - with very little seasoning and lumpy.  I didn't even realize it was supposed to be ranch until my side salad arrived and I realized it matched the ranch dressing with my salad.  Ranch dressing is seriously easy to make, there is no excuse for that scary stuff.  We also ordered some hushpuppies and they were really, really good.  Probably the best I have had around here.  Nice lightly corny batter and lightly fried.  I find most places around here cook the puppies 'til they are almost black and that's not really my thing.    The menu is pretty extensive, much more so than we expected.  That almost worried me because I feel the best restaurants are those with a very clear focus.  This menu is not terribly focused.  My son ordered the homemade corndog and it was delish.  Think state fair corndog - fresh fried and yummy.  Hubs had a chili dog which was somewhat ordinary looking, but the dog itself was super tasty.  I ordered the crab cakes, which were surpisingly very crabby with not too much filler.   I was a little unsure of ordering them, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the mac n'cheese for a side and it was very, very cheddary and rich, but good.    Our waitress was pleasant and efficient and the food arrived quickly.  No complaints AT ALL about service or wait time.  If you are looking for a break from the TGIFridays of the world, The Diamond is a good bet.  It would be a fun place to take out of town guests, etc.   We will be back.",

But worse than the slow uncaring service was the cold  tasteless food that was brought to our table.  I would have complained, but the waitress never returned to check on us.  The barbeque fried chicken was a pile of sweet greasy mess and my wife's salmon sandwich was cold and completely unseasoned...awful.  The fried pickles we ordered also arrived at room temperature.  I ordered a half chicken but got lucky when the waitress got it wrong and delivered a quarter.  The corn muffin could have been used as a weapon.    The new decor was nice but the seating is completely cramped and the noise level was off the charts.  Chuckie cheese would be an improvement over this place.  I'll miss the food and ambiance of the old Diamond.  I would think any recent rating of this restaurant with more than 2 stars were done by owners/family or friends.",

Typical dive-type establishment...had some 50's music jamming on the radio (which was kind of cool).  The food was pretty good.  I tried the Lamb Burger, and was really happy with that selection.  My wife tried one of the Hot Dogs that was smothered in Chili and Pimento Cheese, which she said was really good.  I do admit that even as good as my lamb burger was, I did have a bit of food envy once taking a look at the Hot Dog smothered in goodness right across from me.  Would definitely go back to this place.",

But it was worth the wait. We started off with some fried pickles and onion rings. The fp's were fantastic, while the onion rings were just so-so. They were very thick cut, and the breading was not great. For the meal, I had a Plaza pimento cheese, which was fantastic. The fries (regular, not crinkle cut) were also wonderful. Two friends ordered small block burgers are were very satisfied. I will be returning soon, as you can't beat the Diamond for great greasy food in a cool atmosphere for a low price.",

Never really got even a hello from the bartender, who seemed attached to his phone plugged in or up behind the bar.  My wife was never even offered fruit in her vodka and soda so she drank it plain.  I ordered a pork burger which was utterly flavorless, the vinegar slaw that accompanied it was totally bland also. Fries were soggy and soft and bland also. Burger was supposed to have BBQ sauce on it, turns out when the cheese is melted, that is done with a drop of vinegar sauce, but that doesn't translate to any flavor on the burger. I pushed my plate away and the bartender took it back to the kitchen. Only upon returning from the kitchen did he ask whether I want anything different. No thanks.  And to the ambiance, this place used to be vibrant with staff that was engaging and fun, this time it seemed like everyone there was miserable, no one smiled and everyone was on their phones the entire time.  And back to the bartender, even if he had put fruit in my wife's cocktail, I would have told her not to drink it, since he NEVER washed his hands, handling his phone and fruit for other people's drinks and bottles and plates and washed glasses but never bothered to wash his filthy hands. I am pretty sure a cell phone is about as dirty as money, especially if it's owner never once bothers to concern himself with food safety. We used to love coming here but not anymore.",

    "text": "Bottom line: Good diner meal at Diamond Restaurant. The atmosphere, the menu, the food, all of it True to the old school diner experience. Service was attentive, helpful. If I am ever in the neighborhood again and need good ol' comfort food in a classic diner setup, I'll be hitting Diamond again.  The Deets: While in the CLT area this past weekend, Jay B. and I went out in search of some good comfort food. Always in the mood for good diner fare, Jay brings me to Diamond Restaurant for the evening's meal. It was a great choice, I enjoyed my experience.  It is the perfect diner setting, inside and out. Definitely old school in atmosphere including booths, but also a full service bar in the back as well. Bonus. It's diner on the divey cusp. I dig it. As far as the menu goes, it's full service diner fare with apps, burgers, hot dogs, entrees called House Specials served 11a-9p, salads, subs, sandwiches, and of course breakfast anytime. How can you go wrong with that variety? I went with one of the House Specials in getting the hamburger steak which was an 8oz. chopped sirloin steak, and I got as my side the home-fried potato chips and got the biscuit as well. The biscuit was awesome, soooo good. The home-fried chips were great as well, perfectly done with being crunchy but not over done and brown...golden goodness. The hamburger steak itself had great taste, but from my own fault was a bit dry as I chose not to get the gravy on it. Definitely my oversight. I will remember next time! Service was attentive and helpful, no hiccups there. Overall, a great meal at Diamond Restaurant.",

My collard greens were ok but my biscuit, cornbread, and hush puppies were all sort of unimpressive.  The fried pickles are good but if you can't fry up a pickle you probably need to start a different business.

Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times.   My friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right.   The $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh.",

He kept looking away as if he was talking to someone else and turning to other tables as he was speaking. The service was awful, the atmosphere was mediocre, the food was ok...

She responded \"He got held up but he's coming.\"   We waited, and waited, and waited. The hostess finally came over and took our beverage orders.   We waited, and waited, and watched as the other (later seated) tables received their food orders.   We waited, and waited, and waited some more.

Whatever it was I can't really think of any reason to come back.  When we arrived our friends were already seated in an uncomfortable booth directly in the blast zone of the subzero AC. The booth was rather flimsy so my friend and I felt every fidget from the group behind us.  When ordering drinks I asked what beers they had and received a puzzling answer of \"a lot\". Thankfully a friend let me try his beer that he thought I would like so I ordered one of his and a water. In fact I tried to get a water from our waitress three times before flagging down someone else to ask. My friend who was the only one who did not order an alcoholic beverage said she struggled to get her sweet tea before we arrived.  The burger I ordered was not impressive. It was super greasy and pink in the middle (the menu did not mention cooking the burgers at medium). The fries it came with were a happy surprise (again menu did not mention the burger came with fries). We had to ask for ketchup from the group across from us for the fries, which were better than the burger but on the same level with frozen fries.  The one strong recommendation I can give for this restaurant is the price - the boyfriend and I left having dinner and a craft beer each for under $20 total.",

You can't go wrong choosing something new every time you go. Their fried pickles are perfect for a starter!! They give you heaping portions of whatever you order!   The ambience is slightly noisy but that's because it's not that large of a restaurant. They have a wide range of entrees so there is something for everyone to enjoy. Just ask your waiter or waitress for what's best and they will help you out!  Also make sure to try a dessert they have awesome homemade items for your pleasure.

Anyway, we popped in here at like midnight after a show at the Ovens Auditorium. A few tables outside were still open as were some inside. And seats at the bar.  A nice two-top table with a view of the door was available, so we nearly settled into that except the table was soaking wet as was one of the seats. No worries, they were both wiped down with the same cloth (the table first, not like it matters). Okay, this is off to a good start.  Drinks were ordered and then we got into food. I chose the simple single burger with cheese. Note that it doesn't come with fries. A nice sized patty with all the usual toppings, it was tasty and filling. Good. My wife had the open roast beef sandwich, with comes with mashed potatoes (with gravy) but were clearly packet potatoes. The beef was okay but she really liked their slaw. Nice thinly shredded cabbage with just enough vinegar.  Hard to complain when you walk out after spending less than $25 and it was still open that late.",

    "text": "One of the gems in Charlotte to grab a great burger, basket of fries, fried pickles, footlong hot dogs or one of their plated homestyle specials.  Unfortunately, it's hard for me to veer away from ordering my \"usual\" block burger, but my hubby loves the fried chicken or meatloaf special.  My hubby and I usually come here late night to grab a bite to eat and we haven't been disappointed.  They have an outside patio in front which is nice, but if you don't care for cigarette smoke, you might want to dine inside.  It's a common hangout spot for the locals with a small bar and booth seating.  They serve local beers here as well and the eclectic decor and music contribute to the good vibes here.  They close earlier during the weekdays as they're open well after midnight on the weekends.  The parking can be a bit of a hassle as it's not plentiful, but you can usually manage to locate a space or two.  The burgers are my favorite here and you can't go wrong with them!",

If you are on the fence about going to this place, I encourage you to go! The prices are reasonable as well.

The BBQ fried chicken is good, but the BBQ sauce tasted like it was vinegar based and I personally am not a fan of that kind. The fried flounder and was delicious! We have also had the fried chicken sandwich, which was good but the batter was bland and could use some kind of spices.   As for starters we have had the pimento cheese dip, fried pickles, onion rings, and gravy fries. The pimento cheese dip comes out hot and is super yummy! It get somewhat hard quick so eat up! The fried pickles were very good. I like a good amount of batter on them and that's how they came out. They give you so much that it could feed at least 3-4 people. The onion rings were fried perfectly, but we were very disappointed with the batter used. It was very bland and the batter could use some kind of spices in it. The gravy fries were ok. They got better as you get to the bottom of the basket.   For dessert, you can't go wrong! The banana pudding is hands down amazing! Overall, this place is very good! Id say you are given more food than you pay for which I love because I can eat it the next day! If you are in Plaza Midwood and looking for a southern inspired diner food then this should be your place. It's always full so be prepared to wait 5-15 minutes for a table, but it's worth it!",

Of course the fried pickles are amazing, but I can't get over how ordinary everything is. I ordered spaghetti and literally got barely drained noodles and what looked/tasted like sauce from a jar. No herbs, no parmesan, nothing extra at all. I couldn't eat it because both the noodles and the water were pouring off the plate.  I appreciate getting my money's worth but it could've fed 5 people and had no flavor at all. I love a good diner, but you have to have some flair to the every day food that gets served there.

First off, it's been there since before I was born, so that's usually a good sign.  The building and sign has character, and I like that. The interior was classic, booths and counter/bar seating.  I sat down , the bartender was friendly and attentive. I order the Dixie chicken sandwich, fried (not grilled).  In an attempt to be healthy I ordered the broccoli salad.  The sandwich came, and it was awesome. Clearly not a pre made chicken patty. This was obviously hand battered in house.  My healthy broccoli salad?  Well it was more like broccoli slaw without the cabbage.  Full of mayo, but still delicious and not as bad as the house made chips.   I was beyond delighted to eat lunch here.  They have a full bar, but I was not able to indulge as I was still working.  Everything was clean (even the bathroom), the service was good and the food was delicious. Can not wait to come back the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

Scanning the denizens late on a Tuesday night there were a couple hipsters, a biker or two, a yuppie scattered in for good luck and me and my friend who *surely* don't fit into any stereotypes. ;-)  At any rate, while we would have liked to order some downhome veggies, it was sadly after 9pm. Our server was pleasant, attentive and had a sweet Charlotte Hornets jacket.  We settled in for a round of onion rings to start off. They were piping hot and not overly breaded. I love getting more onion than bread, myself.  Afterwards I ordered a black bean burger and potato salad. The burger was absolutely delicious, but almost too big to fit in my mouth. Lots of flavor packed into it and somehow a non-mealy tomato in December. The potato salad was fairly standard, not overly mayo'ed and better with pepper. I had a beer from Mecklenburg Brewery that was on special that evening and washed things down pleasantly.   My friend ordered a corn dog and hush puppies. She seemed thrilled about both additions to her meal. The Sundrop in a glass bottle seemed to accent it wonderfully.  I'd definitely go back to try their veggies and fried pickles another day.",

    "text": "I had not been to the Diamond in over a year, so when we were deciding where to go out to eat last Friday, I readily agreed when it was suggested.   Something must have changed in the past year because this was not the Diamond I remembered!  We were seated right away, but our waitress acted like she couldn't care less about us.  Her entire demeanor was standoffish and rude.  She spilled drinks and didn't bother to clean them up!  Also, her shorts were so short that it was pretty awkward to be sitting down while she was standing up taking our order, if you're catching my drift here...pretty gross and unprofessional...  Then the food.  We had fried pickles which were fantastic, as expected!! So good.  I ordered barbecue with the chips and collards.  I should have known better than to order collards out of season, but I'm weak to them.  One thing that drives me crazy is when collards are served with the thick stalk still on them, and these were about 70/30 stalk to greens.  The chips were wonderful and crispy.  The barbecue had absolutely no flavor at all.  I doused it in the sauce, which made it a little better, but barbecue should have good flavor without having to cover it in vinegar!  Charlotte has so many other places with good barbecue that this was an especially big disappointment.   Overall this meal for 3 people (2 barbecues, 1 hamburger, 3 cokes and fried pickles) was $50! $50 for poor service and incredibly mediocre food.  I am hoping this was a fluke night and the Diamond isn't losing quality, but I don't think I will be back for a while.",

    "text": "\"Won't get fooled again!!!\"   I had been prior to the change, and now after---and this place still has a long way to go. If you're looking for Penguin 2.0, don't be fooled.   The menu items are similar, the classic favorites are there (Big Bloc burgers, Pimento cheese, fried pickles, etc.), although I feel the attention to detail isn't quite taken as seriously. Sanitation score could use an upgrade as well....91.5? That's pretty borderline.  I feel like they're still struggling to find their identity as well. Let the penguin be the penguin and keep their own menu, you guys should just do the blue plate thing, and do it better than anyone else; you're sort of half in-half out with both concepts.   Also there were like 20 biker guys/gals out front when we came in (mind you it was around midnight) that were a little sketchy; they didn't really seem to be eating/drinking, more just loitering. I don't have anything against the bike crowd, but it caused the entrance to be a little awkward and uninviting.   I might give it another shot, but this time wasn't that great, sorry guys.",

Thank goodness there was a couple walking down the street as I was getting out of the car that caught me up to speed on everything.  So, my son & I headed around the block to the Diamond and BOY are we glad we did!   I love the new menu which managed to incorporate all the old favorites- sweet potato fries, fried pickles, $5 pitchers of beer- along with an expanded selection (especially for vegetarians).  The first time we visited, my son got a corn dog & I got the meatless meatloaf & omg, you HAVE to put this in your mouth!!  Delicious!  Even the five year old ate a few forkfuls.  The two of us also spit an order of gravy fries (there were a ton of leftovers, too). I went back a few weeks later with a girlfriend & we were feeling a need to indulge in bar food.  Ended up ordering both gravy fries & sweet potato fries, a regular hot dog & a jumbo soy dog.  They were just what we were wanting!!  Along with the fact that our eyes were larger than our stomachs, the large portion sizes assured us that we left with two boxes of leftovers!",

    "text": "I had a couple beers in the area last night and thought I would check this place out to see if the food was as good as people were saying it was so a friend and myself wandered over for a late dinner. He had the big block burger and i had the small block burger(southern style) with a accompaniment of fries and hush puppies for appetizers/sides. Oh yah, I even tried out their winky-dinky dog which is a hot dog with pimento cheese and chili. All of the food was EXCELLENT. The prices were cheap and we left feeling full and like we got a great deal for our monies worth.   The atmosphere on the inside of this place gives you a bit of a throwback feel to the 50's diner but everything appeared to be wiped down and clean and there were not any noticeable piles of dust or dirt lurking in the corners. The bathroom was very clean as well which is always a big plus. Seating is mostly booths with one or two open type tables. There is also a small bar were you can sit and have a beer with your meal or just a meal or just a beer. However, you want to mix it up.   While we were there we noticed a girl who ordered the \"Midwood Challenge\" it looked to be some monster sandwich that stood about a foot tall and weighs in at 1lb and 1/2. I think you get a free t-shirt or some lifetime achievement award if you can eat the whole thing with some sides in one sitting. I'll have to investigate that one later on.  The only criticism I can think of and it really has nothing to do with the service, food or physical diner itself would probably be the hours they keep. I mean to say that we showed up at 11:50pm on a Saturday night and they apparently close at midnight. While we slipped in under the wire the whole time we were there they were turning people away who were looking for some late night food. I almost felt bad for the poor hungry bastards until I'd take another bite of my awesome food and all of the empathy my humanity had summoned up for them would disappear seem like a distant memory.",

I went on yelp to see their reviews and pics it made me want the food even more. I got there and it wasn't too too packed but I loved the inside of the place. The prices were too high for the quality of the food. I got a single block burger southern style and it was pretty good. The chili and the slaw was probably best I ever got on a burger but the burger itself was pretty bland to me. I got Mash potatoes and gravy. Mash potatoes were pretty bland and gravy was kinda salty. My friend got a burger and Mac and cheese the Mac and cheese was pretty greesy and oily so we didn't really like it that much. Fries was just like any regular fries but the chicken sandwich was pretty good. Overall give this place a try it's pretty good and the price won't hurt your pocket if it's something you don't really like.",

My husband ordered a vegetable plate, with mashed potatoes, black eyed peas and fried okra.  I like how the menu designated the vegetarian selections with a tiny green leaf.  I was disappointed to learn that the collard greens are not vegetarian. I had the Greek salad, which was not the best one that I ever had, but it wasn't because they didn't try.  The highlights of the salad included pepperoncini, beets, feta, and tomatoes.  The menu stated that the salad came with dolmades, but actually, only one dolmade showed up.  It was so good that I wished for more.  The Greek dressing was so-so.  Next time, I will try another selection.  I really want to hear their play list again!",

On my first few visits, the place was insanely crowded and I got used to hearing \"sorry, we're out of that\" when I placed an order. But those gremlins have been exorcised. Although it's still a busy place, the initial \"OMG! 45 Minute wait\" crowds have gone, and the kitchen has hit its groove.   The fried pickles are STILL the best in town, and I've been happy with everything I've ever gotten here (although I still haven't tried the fried chicken yet!). The burgers are massive and cooked perfectly, although I *wish* they'd get rid of the \"All the Way\" and \"Southern Style\" options and just offer the toppings a la carte (you *can* order a burger with whatever toppings you wish; the menu just makes it look like you can only get them two ways). The pork chops are excellent, and the hamburger steak was everything you could ask for.   Service is fast and efficient, and they've finally started their \"late night\" menu, which is a stripped down version of the main menu, heavy on the breakfast options. On Thursday - Saturday they're open until 4am for your late night food jones!",

I consider myself to be more than just a little critical when it comes to food quality, esp when I am never paying for just my own meal, but for the whole family.   I have honestly never been a fan of the fried pickles, but I do like these ones.   As far as ingredients go, the tomatoes are definitely the typically grocery store variety. A bit too firm and not very flavorful. The lettuce is usually crisp on the burgers but sometimes a little bland.  But I have to be honest enough to say that this place is a local, greasy spoon, not a 5 star resort. And its GREAT! The burgers are always out hot and fresh, always cooked as requested, and always deliciously greasy. The mac and cheese is fantastic, esp if you like the baked variety, not soggy noodles floating in a cheese-like broth.  Expect to find your server with some tattoos and piercings as well as a full knowledge of the menu and a usually pleasant attitude. Expect the booth seats to be lumpy and uneven. Expect to find a wait during typical rush times. Expect the Diamond to deliver a great burger everytime and expect to leave full, and satisfied.",

And the good food they had made in the past has just been ok.  Last time I ate at the Diamond I mulled about not returning, but I decided to give another chance.  This time I got the pimento and cheese sandwich with fries.  Not complicated this late.  I had to wait 45 minutes for the food and all I got was the sandwich.  The waitress said \"I brought you this since I don't think they are getting you the fries\", dropped the plate on the table and walked off.  So obviously Diamond doesn't care about their customers anymore.",

The Diamond gets a gold star for all three.  The staff is friendly, the wait for your food is minimal and the meals taste fresh.  I got the grilled chicken with onions and peppers-- it came with two sides AND cornbread (biscuit or roll) all for under 10 bucks.  I took home half the meal.  If you get an entree-- split it.  My husband and mom-in-law got the burgers and loved them.    For sides:  We tried the sweet potatoes fries, green beans, broccoli salad and vinegar slaw.  The only misses in this experience:  The green beans are definitely canned, so get something else as a side and the cornbread was hard and dry.  But other than that,  we thoroughly enjoyed out experience.  Would def recommend!",

The staff there is rude, constantly has a bad attitude  and a promote a general atmosphere that the customers are an inconvenience when we are there to spend money. Tonight we waited over an hour for our food and had to complain before the server or Management did anything about it and never apologized.

The menu is True to diner expectations. They have some breakfast options (served all day), a ton of burgers and hot dogs, sandwiches, salads and then some bigger item dishes. They are also incredibly vegetarian and vegan friendly...the meatless meatloaf is amazing. The sides are all great, but after 9pm you can only get certain ones so try to get there before!   Love the chips and dips appetizer served with homemade ranch and french onion dressing. The broccoli salad is another one of my absolute favorite choices here.  Great bar full bar with drink specials daily.   Sit outside if the weather is nice, it's a great people watching spot!",

After the greatly anticipated lunch at Diamond Restaurant, I wasn't let down.   Be sure to come hungry and come early. Diamond is a little gem tucked into Plaza Midwood and you just might miss it if you aren't looking for it.   Service was awesome. I felt like I was at home or in a friend's kitchen. Everything about Diamon Resturant had a welcoming feel from the staff, to the wallpaper. Srsly, check out the wallpaper it is super cute.   Looking forward to coming here again, but I will stop by in the off hours.",

I went with cheese overload and got the pimento grilled cheese and side of Mac n cheese.  The Mac n cheese was some of the thickest, yummiest I've had.  Fits the stereotype perfectly of diner Mac n cheese.  The sandwich was also excellent but I could eat each half in two bites.  Very small as I paid nearly the same price for that as the burger   Overall, the food was clutch but some of the food was overpriced.  Worth the spot though as it is in a nice area of town with lots to do.",

They have a variety of options for drinks. $5.00 mimosas on saturdays.  There is a patio out front to enjoy food and drinks as well.   A couple of tips: 1) As a warning  the parking lot is small and there isn't usually open spots. 2) Good to know is that they are open very late on the weekends so this is a good option instead of fast food!",

It's hard to be spectacular in the genre because if a recipe gets taken too far to the edge, it isn't going to be authentic. But if it is authentic, it is bland and unhealthy. So Diamond has authentic southern food which typically will mean a meat and vegetables and Diamond is certainly acceptable. This is an old school place with a hipster vibe and some outdoor seating. A good place to get an inexpensive filling meal before hitting the Plaza Midwood nightlife but is not a destination dining place.",

I can imagine Diamond gets a great deal of customers with all the local businesses in Noda.  I'm a big fan of local diners and this place hit all the right spots for a Saturday afternoon grub fest. Tuna Melt was perfectly cooked and the fries were traditional diner style. I really like the setup inside; it takes you back a few years.   I can see this place being pretty popular later at night and having the ability to quench a serious hunger craving. The menu is pretty traditional with burgers, sandwiches, and typical diner-style food. There is not a great deal of seating here but should be sufficient to accommodate most lunch crowds.",

French fries no better taste or texture than a bag of frozen fries from the supermarket stuck in an oven. If these were actually fried at The Diamond then someone should be overseeing food prep. Maybe too many put in the fryer at once?   Corn muffin was inedible- stale and dry. Fried shrimp were very good, as the one bright spot. Also, service very capable and  friendly.  Maybe the burgers are great but I won't find out as I won't bother returning.",

    "text": "A plaza midwood staple (changed ownership a few years back to those who used to work for the Penguin, I believe). Burgers are always on point, you have to order the sides separate though. Not bad actually because the basket sides are big enough to share. My family and friends have been coming here for years. Always love the fried pickles, I enjoy their hummus plate too.  We typically enjoy the meals but the service is usually a miss. Either takes too long to greet the table and then bring drinks or the servers don't come back for awhile to even take our order. Just recently I went in with my husband, starving a bit, and after bringing drinks our server never came back. I looked around and saw her SITTING in the back talking to another worker...that sucked 'cause I was damn hungry. Hostess acted annoyed when I said I was looking for our server 'cause we were ready to order. Like no big deal...but she's sitting over there and I'm being nice about it. Hopefully they'll make some changes since most of the reviews online are not 5 stars (says a lot). Still have love for The Diamond!",

    "text": "I ordered take-out recently from The Diamond through Living Social. I was told my many Charlottians that this was the place for burgers in Charlotte; \"the best!\" Well, if the burger I was served is \"the best in town\" than I'm moving away.   I ordered the Diamond Boy burger, side of mac-n-cheese, and a drink. The order was off to a bad start when I had to return to the restaurant when I discovered thy didn't put the drink in the bag. Ok, no problem. Honest mistake. It was 6:30pm after all, dinner rush. Then I got to the burger.. patty was way over-done & bland. The onions didn't save the flavor on the burger either, not desirable at all.  I gave 2 stars because the place was packed and obviously I was in the minority getting a bad-burger; probably because I got take-out. The mac-n-cheese was also really good. Even still though, I'm not going back to The Diamond in the near future. Plenty of better choices.",

It literally took three tries to get an order of French fries with pimento cheese... This took over 20 minutes (this was also supposed to be the Appetizer) after food was delivered we attempted to eat what we could, the waffle was undercooked, the burger burnt to a crisp... We ate what we could since we were hungry but it was not worth it. Starving actually sounds like a better option verses eating there: it took us 15 minutes to get our check from the moment we started to prebus our own table",

There was zero flavor other than the taste of onion rings that they must have fried next to it. It actually was pink and they did take it back and did not bill me, waitress was nice and noticed I wasn't eating. Here is the problem, I took a piece off with my fork which I was eating my sides with and put it back in the fryer. Just seems not sanitary. My husband had the chicken sandwich and he really liked it. Just was disappointed as it's by far not the best southern food by any means. It's also very warm in there on hot days.",

    "text": "Read a lot of reviews, some great, some not so great. So me and my buddy decide to go check it out for ourselves. We go on a Saturday at 1:30pm, which I figured was a good time since it SHOULD be just after lunch. But not at the Diamond as it was wall to wall crowded!  So we get seated in under 10 minutes, and we both decide to get the burgers since it was our first time here. I've been in Charlotte 2 years now, and have had some pretty good burgers, but I wanted to see if this was \"the mecca\" for Burgers.   A week before, I decided to check out the Penguin and I admit that their Burgers were damn good! So I thought, No way can the Diamond's be any better. Boy was I wrong! I got the double and my buddy went for the Full Hemi (3 patties for a full pound)! We both ordered it Medium and they both came that way. Always worry about that especially when a Restaurant is super busy like the Diamond.  So bottom line - the Burgers were cooked to PERFECTION! Super juicy deliciousness (fatty beef content for FLAVOR) and their Fries were home cut and made quite well.   Oh, we started the meal with the Fried Pickles as my buddy never had a GOOD version of this dish. And man did we both love them! Crispy with good seasoning (some Cheyenne?) served with Ranch! Oh so yummy!  Back to the burgers.....so after asking for many additional Napkins (which is a GREAT sign at a burger joint because you know it's super juicy), we both stated out loud that this is the BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! Penguin was a close second, only edged out by the Diamond because they cooked my burger to a PERFECT MEDIUM with a nice red/pink center.   So it's a 1 - 2 race, with the Diamond in a close lead!  Overall, a DELICIOUS lunch with a prompt and friendly staff, despite the crowd (another good sign when people literally line up out the door).  Can't wait to come back! If you're craving a GREAT burger, come here!  5 Star Rating is for their AWESOME Burger and Fries!",

    "text": "I've been to the Diamond on many occasions, so when my parents came into town from out-of-state, I had to make sure they tried out the best diner food in Plaza-Midwood. We arrived around 1pm around the end of the lunch rush but there was no wait and we were directed to our table by a staff member. It took our server a moment to come over to our table, but the place was busy and it gave us a chance to settle in and review the menu.  When our server came over to the table she was more professional than friendly, though she may have just been in a hurry. She was quite knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer all my parents' questions about several items. My father is sensitive to caffeine and can't have many sodas, so our server offered to make a fresh pot of decaf coffee for him - extra kudos to her for the effort.  We finally settled on our order, which took only a few minutes - great ticket times from the kitchen. I had the BLT with a side of green beans, and my parents ordered the Marinated Chicken Tips and the Salmon Patties.  I love the Diamond's BLTs for one reason - they don't skimp on the bacon! My sandwich is always a crispy, crunchy mass of bacon. The only complaint I have about the BLT is the sandwich bread is a little thin and doesn't hold up well, but it still tastes delicious. Both my parents were quite happy with their meals and we decided to order dessert.  My father and I ordered the Pecan Pie, my favorite, but they were out... We accepted banana pudding instead and my mother had the Chocolate Delight. The banana pudding was a decent alternative: it was very creamy and whatever wafers had been used in the recipe had disintegrated into mushy goodness.  A little bit of a let-down there, I like a little crunch to offset the pudding, but I'm a little picky.   The waitress brought us our bill in a timely manner and even recommended a couple of local events occurring in the neighborhood that were in walking distance. All-in-all, it was a decent meal, but I was disappointed they didn't have the Pecan Pie. I'll definitely be back to try and get some pie.",

(I actually was giving them another chance after previous less than stellar dining that I've experienced with them recently.) Firstly the waitress was pleasant but not the most attentive, which I'm not sure why bc they weren't that busy. Secondly, I ordered the gravy fries as an appetizer, and the fries were over cooked, not salted at all and the gravy was bland. No worries though, bc I was looking forward to my usual Small block burger and hot dog. To my disappointment, my burger was also extremely over cooked and dry. The hot dog was ok but the chili was a bit salty. My fiance had the salmon which he said wasn't bad, but he also was served burnt fries. He sent them back in exchange for hush puppies which I couldn't believe also came out Burnt and hard as a rock! He ended up sending them back as well. The waitress seemed surprised that we had the audacity to not want burnt food. I couldn't believe it. Not sure if they have different management or new cooks who don't know how to time food. Because of the over cooked bland food and poor customer service I will be unfortunately be saying Adieu to Diamond.",

The food tasted like food only someone whose judgement was impaired would like. The fried pickles were so over fried that the actual pickle on the instead was kind of crispy. The diamond hot dog was also kind of rubbery and the bun was toasted to help mask it being stale. Before I even left, my stomach was angry and doing flips.",

    "text": "I want to give 3.5 stars but decided to round up instead of down. As far as diners go this place is pretty unique and cute. I love that they have a full bar! Such a cool idea. That alone warranted 3 stars in my book . We came just after Christmas so it was still decorated in little lights which I loved, they should just keep them all year round! Lol.   The building itself is small, the booths are smaller than usual and everything is packed in pretty tight. The parking is not the best, it's not a paved parking lot it's bumpy and all over the place.   Prices are great, very reasonable. Fun diner music playing. For as small as it is I actually liked the look of it. The staff do not wear uniforms, they are all in regular street clothes. Which is fine except when I walked in I couldn't tell who were the workers and who weren't. Very casual kinda place.   Now for the food. We came here for one reason only: the Midwood challenge. My husband found out about it and just had to take the challenge to get a free shirt.  it's a giant sandwich with 2lbs alone just in meat. Plus fries and coleslaw on the side and you have to finish it all. I seriously thought my husband was going to die, I don't recommend for anyone to do this.   The food quality itself it wasn't that great. The Midwood challenge sandwich that he and his brother got was pretty much lunch meat you can buy in the grocery store and put on a bun. Tasted like something you can make at home. I had the hot dog with chili and pimento cheese. It was pretty good, the dog itself tasted like it was all beef and it had kinda a Smokey flavor to it. The chili was bean less which is the only way I like it. I also had a side of homemade potato chips with pimento cheese dip. Sooo much cheese. The chips were really good, thin and crunchy.   Overall good diner, not high quality food but a good bang for your buck with reasonable prices. If I lived here I would visit again but mainly because of the bar in it .",

    "text": "Been a long time since I was here but today was a big disappointment.  Probably been at least seven years since I have been here but it was one of two places in Plaza Midwood that I liked. The other was the Penguin which closed last year.  Both were Charlotte Institutions and places to go late night for a late dinner. Both were good diners with National Reputations. and always had good food.  Have a list of places I want to try but with Road Construction, two were eliminated quickly and will have to get at a later day so i settled on Diamond.  Walked in and was seated shortly thereafter in a nice booth. Server was there to give me a menu and take my drink order.    Looking over the menu, I was in luck. There Seafood was one of my favorites, a Fried Oyster Plate. Ordered that with the Vinegar Slaw etc and pulled out the smartphone to check the latest headlines.  About two minutes later, the server showed up with a menu and informed me they were out of oysters and I needed to try again.,  Decided on the 1/2 Fried Chicken and upgraded to all white with sliced tomatoes and Fried Okra with a biscuit as my side.  I was shocked how quick the order came out. If it was made from scratch, one of the fastest turn arounds of an order. Either that of I last track on time which is possible.  Nice presentation.   However the food did not measure up to the presentation.   I knew to start with, I was taking a chance on the Sliced Tomatoes but there are still some Vine Ripened Tomatoes that taste like real tomatoes rather than flat. These had no real tomato taste to them at all.  The Okra was good and that brings us to the Chicken.  There were four pieces of Chicken One was a breast and one was a wing and I know they consider a wing to be white meat ( I don't) but the other two pieces were a drumstick and a back.  Have never seen backs and legs considered as white meat.  Chicken was very bland. The Drumstick was under cooked next to the bone. The other pieces were OK but very bland and the batter that they were covered with had no distinct taste at all.  At least they could have used the traditional Southern Seasoning of Salt and Pepper in with the flour but I could taste one of that.  Another catch at the end. When my check arrived, I looked at it and immediately register a look of shock. Total Bill was almost $28 dollars and I knew it should be closer to $14 - $15.  Server saw  my shock and we both took a look at the bill and the Oysters they were out of were still on the bill.  It was promptly removed.  Service was OK, atmosphere somewhat of a Dive but it was for years and that leads to the charm of the place but the food preparation leaves much to be desired.",

    "text": "This was... let's just say interesting. A big group of friends and I (I believe like 8-9 people total) came to The Diamond Restaurant for a late dinner on a Saturday night. There was quite a wait so we decided to get shots and drinks at the bar. Let me preface by saying that we were not drunk wasted folks. We hadn't had anything to drink during the night and since there was a wait, we decided to indulge in a few. The first thing that caught my attention was the staff. They weren't very friendly and honestly seemed annoyed by everyone in our party the entire time we were in the building. After waiting about forty minutes or so, we eventually got to our table and the weird attitude continued with our server. We were enjoying our time with each other so it didn't put a damper on our time. But I certainly picked up on it and it was uncomfortable.  When it came time to order, I got a black bean veggie burger with sweet potato fries. It came with spicy mayo, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions. The sweet potato fries were my favorite. They came with a side of honey mustard and I finished more of the fries than my veggie burger. The burger wasn't bad at all. I would order it again, the fries were just stellar and I couldn't stop eating them! The table also ordered a few appetizers. I tried the hot pimento cheese dip and the classic fried pickles. The cheese dip came with an assortment of crackers and the pickles came with a side of ranch. Both were good for me but I saved most of my appetite for my entree.   I'm not sure what happened with the service that night but the food was pretty good and the kitchen was on top of things. It was nice that we weren't left waiting forever for our food after a long wait for our table. If I find myself back in Charlotte I may be up for giving the service at The Diamond Restaurant another chance but I won't be jumping for the opportunity.",

I stopped by around 2:30 and went inside from the rain only to have the lady inside tell me they were closed when their business hours clearly say 3am.  I really don't get why businesses post a specific closing time but don't honor their times.  If you don't want people coming in then say what time you really intend to close like 2:30 not 3.  It's super annoying because now I've already wasted 15 minutes of my life that I'll never get back because your business posts business hours of 3am and you decide that you aren't honoring those business hours.  They also switched to a late night menu whereas before they used to have a full menu before.  I'm not sure who is making alot of these changes here but someone needs to check themselves because this is not how you do business.  I'm not sure if I'll ever return or recommend this business to anyone else because of these experiences either.",

The Diamond is a True Charlotte institution. One part old school diner, one part dive. All parts badass.   If you can't find something you like on this menu, well the problem maybe you then. There's a little bit of everything. You'll find some of the best fried pickles in the city here. Among my favs: pig wings (deep fried pork shanks, get 'em. You're welcome), gravy fries (make sure to get pimento as well), onion rings, small block burger (add cheese, all the way), pork chops, meatless loaf (and I'm not a vegetarian), and the Dixie chicken sandwich. They also have homemade desserts and a full service bar. Choose those extra calories wisely.   I love to sit on the patio here and people watch. Plaza Midwood, don't ever change. This is a great spot to grab some grub before (or after) hitting up Legion Brewery which is right across the street.",

    "text": "Diamond gets most everything right about a 21st-century diner experience.  Diamond was apparently a neighborhood fixture that dated back to the 1940s, but closed in 2010.  Now, I don't live in Charlotte and only started visiting in recent years after my brother moved to town, but I'm going to take a wild guess that, back in the old days, Diamond had plenty of evocative old diner atmosphere but a boring, tired menu.  (Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.)  The present-day Diamond obviously retains the bones and fixtures of the old diner but it's been overhauled and retrofitted for modern tastes.  It's almost like a diner production-designed to evoke some movie roadhouse rockabilly diner of old, but which never actually existed until the last 15-20 years:  Regular diner fixtures, but darker colors that suggest a bunker-like barroom, neon lights, what looks like a full bar, rock and roll on the sound system.  At lunchtime, it's pretty evocative--although I could see it getting obnoxious late at night--and I like it.  I imagine that the menu was overhauled, too.  There is still a long, long list of diner and Southern standards, but there are also a few nods to the current century and to the existence of vegetarians:  black bean burgers, black bean hummus, a meze platter, a \"meatless loaf.\"  I went with fried chicken, black eyed peas, and collards.  In my town of Cincinnati, just about the only two places other than chains to get fried chicken is an ultra-yuppie place and a kinda-expensive place that caters mainly to senior citizens and even the seniors' parents.  Diamond's fried chicken was only pretty good, but the veggies were boldly flavored and cooked perfectly.  (Vegetable plate sounds like a good idea, but oddly enough, getting it doesn't save you any money.)  Prices are very fair, and the iced tea was done right.",

Too bad the biscuit NEVER showed up), we had to ask multiple times for drinks, silverware wasn't delivered until we asked for it after our entrees were delivered, amidst a myriad of other problems.

Im a vegetarian and have had this type of dish at Letties, which is around the corner on Shamrock -- and they do Veggie Meatloaf really well...so Diamonds paled terribly in comparison. Diamonds Veggie loaf is too dry and absolutely too large, unseasoned, and over breadcrumbed. The squash was swimming in cream, as though it hadnt even been cooked...so that was gross.

The smell of fresh vinyl's a teeny bit overwhelming, but soon, it'll be taken over by the sweet aroma of clogged arteries. Fried pickles, burgers, and dogs are here, but the menu expands - and there's some eggplant parm, some greek stuffs, even a sizable salad section. Guess what, my vegan darlings? There's a meatloaf-style dinner here, and you can eat it. I did, and it was carroty, savory, lots of thyme. Lovely.  But I already know what I'll be ordering every time I step foot in here after a number of beers - Poutine. Because it's here, all pimento-cheese-encrusted, choice of veg or meat gravy, and good lord in heaven, it is friggin' awesome.  Officially open later in the week. And forever mobbed after that.",

We promised ourselves we'd stop in and glad we did!  We came in around 12:30pm on Sunday September 1st. It was so packed we sat at the counter. Of course we got the burgers. Mine was the \"Big Block\" Southern style (chili mustard, onions, & coleslaw) for $6.95, and hers was the \"Small Block\" for $3.95. I ended up having to make it a fork-and-knife burger for the top half fell over. For a burger that good, it doesn't matter how I eat it! We split the sweet potato fries ($3.95) and there were plenty too.  We hope to be back for we are Panthers fans!",

Friendly waitress was quick and took our orders promptly. Got my go to, the soy veggie dog. It was just as delicious as I remembered it to be. I can be happy again.   Bar is nice and wonderful to grab a quick, cheap beer before having to run off, to the next bar or from whoever's chasing you.  Expanded menu includes all our old favorites plus a couple extras, everything looks delicious. Will have to bring stretchy pants next time.",

The Diamond is your typical greasy spoons kinda place with all of the fried fare your body can handle for a heavy lunch, late-night bender, or overt pig out.   Keep True to my favorites of old, the Small Block -- Southern Style is my go-to. The chili and slaw atop a nice, flattop burger sings happy tunes to the greasy glands in my brain. Crinkle cut fries round it out to really make you hate and love yourself at the same time, too.   Love the feel of this spot. The layout feels weirder and weirder upon every visit. Not too many seats to fight over in this joint. Waits can get a little lengthy, but most people are in and out while keeping popularity in mind.   Count me in as part of the Diamond fan club.",

The best way I can describe the burger I had (full block with bacon and cheese all the way) was a cross between 5 guys and Wendy's. That's a damn good compliment in my book since I love both of those spots.   I got a side of sweet potato fries to go along which were great.  Next time I'm going 2 burgers though because frankly just one full block didn't do it for me. Then again, my burger craving has been off the charts as of late.  Overal, great neighborhood joint, great burgers, friendly people, my kind of divey type of joint. Excited to get back.",

They got there just in time to sit down.  The service was friendly and the food definitely blew me away.  I've seen this place before, but haven't tried it until now.  Looks like they have re-done the inside at some point and the outside porch awning was brand spanking new... and there were some construction contractors on the  top roof unloading materials when we arrived.  Anyways... onto the food!  The menu definitely have some unique things going for it.  I ended up choosing a vegetarian dish:  Meatless Loaf and Soy Milk Mash.... came with 2 sides of which I chose the sweet potato fries and hush puppies....  After I ordered, I realized I could have gotten more veggies, but I was happy with what I got.  The loaf was amazing... we sat there trying to figure out what was in it... but man, I could have sworn there was some sort of meat in there.  I did order the pig wings for the table, which were AMAZING... our server said it comes with (5) pig wings, but we ended up getting (6)... I guess the extra wink I gave to our waiter paid off (or probably not).  Definitely will come back to try their other menu items.  But I'm considering the Diamond a very bright spot for the Charlotte food scene.",

    "text": "I'm not going to lie, I'm a little disappointed in this place. I was always a fan of The Penguin, then once it changed owners my love went to Pinky's. The Diamond has similar stuff like Pinky's, but just doesn't get there. We first arrived on a Saturday around noon and we were seated immediately. Our server was fast and attentive (which is why I'm giving this place three stars instead of two). Our food came out pretty fast and I appreciated them making sure my two little girls got their food first. As a parent it makes my trip much easier when the kids eat first so they're not squirming around. I got them both a veggie plate which is a great option for picky kids. You can pick two sides for each plate, and both kids enjoyed it. We got fried pickles which is just like Pinky's and were fantastic as always. I ordered the Dixie chicken sandwich and was let down. The chicken didn't have enough flavor for being fried. I was hoping it would have more of a kick or something. It was a massive sandwich though, and had to take home the rest. I tried the pimento cheese fries and was completely disappointed. It had hardly any cheese flavor to it, and I could only really taste the pimento if anything. My husband ordered salmon patties with hush puppies and green beans with a biscuit. He said everything was pretty bland and was disappointed as well. Once he found out our bill topped $50 he definitely wasn't leaving happy. Considering how much the food is for the quality of it, I won't be returning here again. I suggest you skip this place and just go to Pinky's. You'll be much happier there.",

Please note that after 9pm they stop serving the warm side items.   I would highly recommend this place. Food and location are great!

I think meat-eaters would love this too.  I love the decor of the place, the feeling, and the atmosphere. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the slow service.

They were busy, but we were seated immediately. That was the high point of the night. Waitress approached after about 5 minutes to take our drink order. We ordered the fried pickles at the same time as our drinks because we were starving. Pickles came out about 20 minutes later. How long does it take to fry some damn pickles?!? Seriously. Waitress didn't take our order until we were halfway done with the pickles. I ordered the cheesesteak and my buddy ordered the fried flounder sandwich. Then we waited. And waited. 30 minutes later the waitress comes to our table and says our food is up next. Meanwhile tables who were seated after us were already eating. Finally our food arrives around 9:30....1 HOUR after we sat down. My cheesesteak tasted like it had been sitting on the griddle for a while. Plus it was full of fat and gristle. Pretty much got the impression the kitchen forgot about our food. We ate because we were hungry, but I will not be back. With so many other options in Charlotte, I'm not wasting my time here.",

The fried pickles were just as good as the Penguin was, of course with a good ol' Big Block burger with bacon, cheese, and mayo. The service is good and my drink stays full. Portion sizes are worth the price. Only real negative keeping Diamond from a 5 review is the location and parking. If you're from out of town and trying to find it, you will pass by or miss the street it is on. The parking is either in the 6-10 spots at the business, on the street, or in the back lot. If you go here during lunch hours, or prime dinner hours expect a line and a wait.   Food is great, great atmosphere, and service is great. A well deserved 4",

As I am watching the bartender make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest vodka in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over it which had a terrible color!  I love a good bloody mary.  This bloody mary was no bueno - cheap vodka, crappy mix and no pickled vegetables.  On to the food - I ordered wings and fried pickles.  The fried pickles were good - the wings were not.  They were chewy, not spicy and dry.  Fast forward 3 hour and I feel terrible - in fact, I am in and out of the bathroom for a good 2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN.

The meat was thin cut and not high quality.  Tasted like the standard multi meat bland loaf that is cheap.  Friend had double burger which was good.  Plan to split an order of fries, one order is huge.  All in all not bad but could use some polishing (and dusting (esp the retro lamp in the center of the ceiling)",

I had the BLT which I've never been a big fan of (I ordered it because I wasn't that hungry), let's just say I am a fan now =)  My friend had a huge burger, can't recall the name of it, well, he's quite the burger lover and said it's the best he's had in a while. We also split a side of fries between the 2 of which we practically fought to the death over cause they were soooo darn good! Just fries right? Eh! Wrong! Sometimes they're over or undercooked, these were literally cooked to utter perfection. I've been dreaming of the BLT w/ fries from here ever since.   First time going that I actually sat on a table... Service was excellent. The waitress (not sure of her name), was very friendly and prompt - even when she got super busy and apologized for the wait for our drinks! Dude! We waited like 2 minutes if that! lol The owner is amazing and is so hands on in this business and that's what I like to see. I don't respect owners that are sitting somewhere in an office or at home.   I must add that the Diamond is about a 30 minute drive for me - but it's my new favorite place to eat or drink and worth it! Great food, great prices, great service, great atmosphere =)",

I've had the patty melt which had no flavor and the prime rib sandwich. They asked how I wanted it cooked but the meat was so thin and tough you couldn't tell anything about it. I had to add A1 to get any flavor. It's served on a regular hamburger bun that fell apart with the toughness of the meat. The fries were nothing to write home about. My friend had the veggie burger which was inedible due to the seasoning. The soydog was served in the stupid paper cups that will tilt over and drop your dog on the table at ease.  The servers are friendly and the remodel is enjoyable but the food needs work.",

    "text": "Ever since Penguingate I've been so ready for the Diamond to open.  And then it did.  And due to transportation issues, I couldn't go.  Not until last week!  Despite lots of interaction with the twitter (they #FFed me!  *tear*  True love!)  and staring moodily and jealously at my friend's frequent foursquare check-ins, i just COULD NOT manage a way to get myself in those doors.  And then I did.    I'm actually glad I wasn't able to come for so long because it seems like they're really in stride now, as opposed to the early hiccups that come from being a super-hyped, newly opened restaurant in a fiercely loyal neighborhood.  I heard about all the kinks and wrung my hands with worry...but I think we're okay now.    Immediately upon entering my friend and I were summoned to the bar for hugs...we knew literally every person sitting there, including the hostess and a few of the waiters.  It being a monday night, it wasn't super crowded and we got our table lickety-split.  Of course I had to try the small block and the fried pickles first...duh.    And they did NOT disappoint.  Everything I loved about the Bird's burger, yet somehow even better than I remembered!  Maybe it's because I chose to love them before I even tried the food, most likely it's because it's just that good.  The fried pickles were also just as I remembered them.  I can't wait to try the new stuff, now, particularly the po greek boy and the crab dip.    Also, despite hearing a lot of stories about super long waits, our orders were taken and the food was brought out super fast.    Great prices, great food, great atmosphere, great people, great location...this really deserves it's WOOHOO!  As good as it gets!  review from me.  I'll be back.  I may move in.",

    "text": "Terrible experience. We went here to get a drink at the bar and when we sat down, it seemed we had taken someone's seat (apparently it was obvious because his drink was there-according to the bartender). He then starts nudging one of the men we were with so we decided to move down. While this is happening he is communicating with the bartender and both are glaring at us even after this occurred. We then are looking at the bartender to get a second drink and I kid you not she yells \"YOU GOT A PROBLEM\" from the other side of the bar. It was at that moment that i realized, \"Oh! This bartender is obviously a crazy person. Great.\" All the while I'm finding this experience hilarious so while she was ignoring us I said \"You got a problem?\" as she looked my way. This only made her totally lose her mind and she yells \"LOOK IF YOU HAVE A F**KING PROBLEM YOU CAN JUST GET OUT!\" So we all decided it was probably time to go before the bartender murders us. She then storms to the kitchen and brings out a manager who says \"You guys need to leave now.\" So we, now pretty irritated and confused, told her as soon as we finished our beers we would be out of there. This is when it gets pretty crazy. The manager storms out from behind the bar, towards us and grabs my beer out of my hand, spilling some on me (which I really don't care that much about but still) and goes to grab a woman we were also with's drink out of HER hand. Now she had a full drink so she was a little less than thrilled that they were taking it away after we had paid for it, so she refused to let her have it. THEN the bartender lunges for the drink and is on top of this woman, grabs the drink and we pretty much spring out to the applause of the staff. I really don't write reviews unless the service/food is really bad or if it's really good. It seems we were profiled as we walked in for not being locals and we were definitely treated differently. It's clear that the Diamond no longer cares about their customers and will willingly jump on top of a lady to get her drink from her. We didn't even get to try the food so I can't speak for that. But our trip to the Diamond was super weird and we won't be going back (not that they would want us back). This one stuck with me- Tread carefully.",

We we're greeted and seated within a minute of walking in the door. Our waitress was friendly and service was prompt.  We got the pig wings, the Po'Greek burger, and Mac&cheese. Let me start by saying, this place deserves five stars for it's Mac&cheese alone. Hands down. The pig wings were fall off the bone tender and the bbq dipping sauce was so good, I kept it for the fries. The burger was so good, that I literally could not stop saying \"so good\" as I was eating it. The fries were good, crisp and crinkle cut. My only regret was that I didn't save room for dessert but you can bet I will when we return.",

The guys who took it over, polished it up without overdoing it or making it too cool for school.  It is packed tightly with tables, I don't remember it being so compact on my last visit, but it works.  The powder, deep, robin's egg, Tiffany box.... blue vinyl booths give me a hard on.  I didn't know I was going to the Diamond on this sneak peek night, but Julia S. and the Mister texted me, so I headed over.  Since I wasn't hungry, I just ate a Winky Dinky dog and a shit ton of their french fries smoothered with pimento cheese and vegetarian gravy.  Jeez Louise.  I wonder what I would have consumed if I were hungry. Har, har, har.  Really, I don't even like gravy on my french fries and I could not stop eating.  The Winky Dinky dog was served on a split top white bread bun, sent straight from white bread forbidden hell and it was delicious.  It really tasted like it was fried and finished on the grill, complete with the grill taste-   4th of July when you were a kid kinda taste, topped with chili and pimento cheese.  I added raw onion and yellow mustard and called it a day.  I checked my Magic Eight Ball for the Diamond's future. Will The Diamond succeed?  It is decidedly so.",

    "text": "Over-hyped crappy dinner food!  Calling all counterculture weirdo's, here is your culinary Mecca.  I'll break this down in three sections:  FOOD: I've tried several things on the menu and have to say it all tastes really generic. You think they would have some ham hocks in their collards? Nope! Even the fired pickles that people go nuts for are just out of the jar pickles you or I could buy and make. Burgers are meh. Their french fries are crinkle cut fried, which I find are the worst kind of fry. Reminds me of terrible cafeteria food I ate in grade school. Drinks are overpriced unless you came to drink Tall-boy Pabst Blue Ribbon.  SERVICE: 98% Chance are you will be served by an apathetic hipster with either facial piercings or covered in tattoos. The service has always been slow. I can't blame it completely on the wait staff, it could be that the food coming out of the kitchen is slow. Regardless, be ready to ask for refills if you want them.  ATMOSPHERE: If you are looking for a dumpy dive-bar were you can probably score some hepatitis C from the bathroom, then you hit the jackpot. There is a jukebox which has some interesting selection on it. Old floors and beat-up tables and booths. This place could use more than just a fresh coat of paint, but it seems like the regulars love the dumpy look. Speaking of the regulars, these people have more ink than a comic book convention.  Bottomline: Service is slow, Food is underwhelming to poor and Atmosphere is unclean. Consider traveling here only after being drunk.",

But it doesn't do much good to be open late if they can't handle the volume. They refuse to do any to go orders as soon as they start getting busy and eventually just disconnect the phone line. Great customer service.... if it's past 10 you're better off going to one of the many other restaurant/bars in the area like Thomas street around the corner or to Fuel Pizza if it's after 2, they can actually handle their late night volume.",

    "text": "Had just left the Belk bowl after a disappointing game and we were wet and hungry after spending a few hours in the rain rooting for our team.  The decor is really cute, kind of a retro feel to the place.  There was a short wait for a table, but nothing major. I wasn't crazy about the chilly corner they sat us in, there was a storage area for supplies right behind us and the staff kept squeezing themselves in there to retrieve supplies, but it was busy, and we were hungry.   Our waitress was friendly but I think might have been a little distracted. Granted she had a big table she was also working on, but I was once a waitress, and I know that it's no excuse to neglect another table. Too bad for her, because we're really good tippers when we're treated right.  We ordered pickle chips for an appetizer. They took forever to come out after she assured us they'd be right out, and sure enough our entrees came out about 60 seconds after, So serving skills on busy nights definitely could be improved. That being said, the food was pretty darn good.  The pickle chips were right up there with the best we've had. The pickle had good flavor and the batter was light and crispy. I ordered a small block bacon cheeseburger, he ordered a black bean burger, we shared a basket of fries and he also had some fried okra. My burger was a 1/3 pound burger, pretty big for something called small block. It was done just the way I asked, and the bacon was crispy. His black bean burger was really good. It was a relatively thick burger, probably a 1/2 pounder, and he did polish that off. The fries were perfectly done,   crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. His fried okra was average, good but nothing special. Pitcher of beer was fairly priced, and a nice local brew. The check took a little longer than it should have to arrive at our table, but not too awful bad.   So - in conclusion - pretty darn good food but on this particular night, less than stellar service, and they really out to do away with that table in the chilly corner, or at least not double it as a storage space right behind, it's really annoying.",

We had the fried pickles to start and I must say they are the best I ever had! I gave 2 stars because the service was prompt, price is right, pickles were great but unfortunately the rest of our food was just OK (and that's generous).   We both ordered the BBQ dipped fried chicken plates with mac and cheese and collards. First off, my chicken and greens were luke warm. The greens were tasty but the chicken and mac and cheese were definitely under seasoned. I really wanted to like this place because of the reviews but this time didn't do it (2.5 stars if I had the option). There's a possibility I may give it another shot and try something else.",

It was not freshly fried. How dare you serve old fried chicken!! Shame on you! I'll stick to the regular menu next time. Got black eyed peas and collards as sides and those were quite tasty along with the pimento cheese dip. Love getting a full basket of assorted crackers for the dip. So stick to the basics here.

The place was nice and cool and had the end of the Panthers game on tv.  Shortly after being seated, a gentleman promptly came and took our food and drink orders.  Shortly thereafter, our drinks arrived and we placed our orders.  I ordered the \"Diamond Dog\" and a \"Small bloc\" all-the-way with pepper-jack cheese.  My girlfriend ordered a side salad and the spaghetti (which I would have never ordered by the way...I mean its not like we were at Mamma Ricattas!).  The salad arrived almost immediately.  As for the rest of our order, well lets just say, if we would have held our breaths while waiting for our order, our bodies would've decayed and turned back to ashes and dirt.  It def didn't seem crowded, and they certainly seemed to have plenty of staffing on hand.  So its anyone's guess as to what was going on back there...??  WHEN the food finally arrived, myself and the four other people I was with, were less than satisfied.  My girlfriend was disappointed with her spaghetti.  She said it didn't have any real flavor, was bland and a bit runny; yuck!  I can't say as the burger was THAT bad.  The pepper-jack cheese added a nice touch.  As for the hot dog , well it was a hot dog.  It was good, not great.  It was about what I would've EXPECTED it to be, but not what I would've HOPED it would be.      I am not gonna get into whether the Diamond is better than the Penguin or not, because to be honest, I've had less than steller experiences there as well.  Everything about this place is average to me.  Our waiter was a nice bro, but our food took forever to arrive.  My food was decent, but my gf hated her food.  Go here once, just to see what the hype is all about, then go explore the many other options in the area.",

I would like to think that of all dining establishments, and I eat out a lot over the last 30 years living here, Diamond employees would treat everyone the same. Wrong. I was eating with an african american friend and she was snubbed, big time. My friend asked me if I noticed it, which of course I said yes. The waitress was outwardly more rude to my friend, not looking at her and not addressing her, but myself. My friend paid for lunch and of course the girl practically threw the bill at her.

The employees were all really polite and down to earth.  The food did take a long time, but it was definitely worth the wait, as it all tasted really good and the waiter let us know that due to the wait it was on the house, which was very nice of them. Most chain restaurants won't go out of your way to give you a great experience but the Diamond was a great local gem that cares a lot about customer service.   I'd definitely come here again and would recommend it to anyone.",

After sitting for 1 hour and 15 mins and no food, we left. Good sweet tea. Spoke to three people in their and none of them were happy. I don't plan to return for a while.",

We ordered the pickle chips and the Greek Platter to share.  This is a real \"diamond\" in downtown Charlotte.  The Penguin has nothing on this place!",

I have been back a few times after my first time..    1. Corn dogs and all hot dogs..  all KOSHER so if you dont like the taste of Kosher than you wont like thier hotdogs. I wish they would have just normal hotdogs.    2. Fried Chicken is good a litttle too greasy but good great flavor and seasoning. Mac nad cheese and Mash Potatoes I had as my sides..  MAC and cheese was dry  ont impressed but its a good solid recipe though thye just need to tweek it a little make sure they have more moisture in it. MashPotaoes were ok a little dry but the gravy made up for it.   3. Hamburgers good burgers but I hate the fact that thier buns are cold..  and not heated nor toasted it ruins the burger all together.    4. Fries are good and home made chips are good to.     Try it out  at least once support this staple and great establishment!",

Their block burgers hit the spot for a quick diner burger as well. Fried pickles are super heavy but good. Overall I don't hate it, but don't love it. There are a few choice things on the menu I come back for.",

    "text": "Maybe it should be renamed the \"Cubic Zirconia\" since The Diamond serves cheap, low quality Shit!   I realize that this is supposed to be a Charlotte classic.  But I wish this grease factory would disappear like the grossly overrated Penguin that was around the corner.  I am astounded by the positive reviews.  I get that it's got a unique classic vibe.  But the food is simply disgusting.    I was fully expecting a greasy spoon type of place.  And I'm just fine with indulging in something unhealthy... as long as it tastes good.  NOTHING that I ate at The Diamond tasted good.  Let's start with the onion rings.  I'm not sure there was any onion in there.  It was more like I was eating hard chunks of over fried breading.   The fried pickles were okay.  Just okay.  The burgers - How one effs up a burger this badly is beyond me.  I would rather get a burger from McDonald's.  I am Not exaggerating about this!  Skinny, way overcooked patties.  The bun looked like an obese individual rolled around on it for a while.  The lettuce was wilted.  And there was No flavor.  With all of the heavy stuff that I was ordering I figured I'd order one lighter item, so I went with the Grecian Meze Platter.  BLECH!!! I don't think it was possible to screw this up.  I really didn't!  The pitas seemed stale rather than the claimed \"toasted\".  But the real highlight for me was the hummus.  I was looking forward to some creamy, flavorful goodness.  This hummus looked like something out of \"Two Girls, One Cup\".  And by that I mean \"Shit in a Cup\".  It was Rock Hard.  It was not possible to dip one of the stale pitas into it.  I tried. The stale pita broke.  I stuck my knife into the \"hummus\" and let go.  The knife didn't budge.  It just stood there standing straight up.    If you want to clog your arteries, at least make it worth it.  Ingest your grease somewhere other than The Diamond.",

I highly recommend their meatless loaf with soy mashed potatoes.  It's a huge, delicious vegan fest that is more than one person can devour in  a single sitting.",

Apparently, this is the joint where Agent Carrie Mattheson on the show Homeland freaks out in season one.  I think she must have ordered a full boat of fried pickles.  What is that?  Didn't know such a thing is a staple in Southern Cuisine.  Three big dudes, plenty of pickles left over.  I opted for a patty melt and it was friggin' divine.  This is classic Southern diner fare and me likey.  Service was great, place was hopping mid-week, tucked away in a trendy neighborhood.  Don't spend time in Charlotte and drop by this joint for a satisfying lunch.",

Meatloaf is great.  Get the homemade potatoe chips, and ask for some blue cheese to top them off.  Bar-b-que sandwich is always good.  Great atmosphere, jukebox, and a great place to crowd watch.
