    "text": "I went here on my hour lunch break for the first time ever (and I work at the Oldnavy right around the corner) I was prepared to pay about $12 for my meal because my coworkers informed me that MooYah is a bit pricey, but delicious quality food. By the time I was able to take my lunch break and walk over there I was starving. I walk in and the first thing I notice is the cleanliness of the restaurant. I walked up to the register explaining to the young woman it was my first time in here and I wasn't too sure about the ordering process. She was very kind and helped me create the burger I wanted with my meal. The wait time wasn't too bad. I expected it to be awhile because it was being prepared fresh and all. The moment my meal was ready I was shocked by the size of my burger. Okay. First off let me tell ya, I'm not a big burger fan to begin with so I wasn't expecting to LOVE the burger, but yes I loved that burger! It was by far one of the best burgers I've ever had! Fresh lettuce, American cheese with their MooYah sauce (thousand island dressing style sauce). I opted to get the regular fries and they were just as good. As I was eating I noticed a young family going up to the bell to ring it because they were satisfied with their meal and experience. As cheesy as it sounds I too rang that bell. I will be going back. I already downloaded the app for future orders and all. So I'm sure the employees at MooYah will recognize my face soon enough. So again thank you for the great quality food and wonderful customer service.",

There was maybe 3 orders ahead of ours. 10 mins go by, no food yet. It took about 22 mins to get 2 burgers and a fry.  I Had ordered a single cheeseburger, hubby a double. My burger was the same thickness as his. There was nothing spectacular about the burgers, I could have made them at home for less than we paid there. The sweet potato fries were ok, they were hot, could have used a little more salt on them. All in all it was ok but not somewhere I would probably eat at again.",

Things didn't seem to be going well for them, as no one acknowledged them whatsoever while I stood there. I went to the restroom, and when I returned, they were still standing there and decided to leave.  I was then greater by a man and pointed towards the family now leaving. Another staff member chased them down. I ordered a burger with a few toppings, and an order of sweet potato fries. The bun to burger ration was terrible, and the bun was so greasy that I was unable to finish my burger. The toppings had been stuffed on the underside of the burger, and we're pretty meager....3 pickle ends, half a strip of bacon, and the blue cheese was barely heated. The sweet potatoes fries were redeeming until the 3 men working began to order the lone female worker around much like Cinderella while they all dissapeared",

My son loves that you can order avocado for a burger topping.  Their veggie burger is tender and well-seasoned, and their freshly baked buns hold together and are yummy. (I'm craving their veggie burger right now as I write this!)  Both the potato and sweet potato fries are out-of-this world delicious, fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside.  MOOYAH's shakes are thick, creamy and decadently rich.  They will make your eyes roll back in your head!   They are THAT good!  The service was friendly, attentive, efficient and speedy.  We will definitely be back!  MOOYAH will be our treat after our weekly Costco run, for sure!",

    "text": "Been holding off on reviewing, but I will now. I've tried to like this place because it is conveniently located, but I'm incredibly disappointed.  First, let's talk cost. 2 burgers and a hot dog with 3 drinks and a thing of fries is $30. If I'm going to spend that kind of money on fast food, it better be worth it...and it is definitely not worth it.  The food is way over salted. The 4 times I've tried to eat a burger here all I could taste was the salt on the meat. The last time I ate in the restaurant here, my burger was pink in the middle still and was really spongey. Not good.  Final straw was when I was waiting on a to-go order and one of the staff members was trying to add sweet tea to the canister. The two guys standing behind the counter watched as this poor girl struggled with the container behind me. I didn't see how she lost her grip on it, but she managed to dump the whole thing of sweet tea down the entire back of me and all over my purse and shoes - and I was in work clothes. The two guys behind the counter never bothered to help this girl clean up, instead they laughed and tried to look disinterested. She apologized, but it wasn't her fault - no one bothered to help their fellow coworker and they left her to clean up the mess. One of the guys dipped into the back, and I'm assuming the guy who came to speak to me was a manager, but he never apologized and handed me a wad of napkins to clean myself off with and vanished again. Really? Your store managed to ruin a jacket and my work clothes and you don't even utter an apology? I've told my coworkers and friends to not even bother - just go up the road and get a great burger from Shomar's instead.",

BUT, my son and I were truly hungry for home-cooked burgers and were in the area so we tried a #2 time. I MUST admit my well done burger was still EXCELLENT in taste and IF I had known it would be THAT AWESOME I'd have waited on the fries! I'm a gastric bypass survivor, so burgers are 'one of those foods' I must eat very slowly...and in 2-3 meals. For me, once a burger is refrigerated it loses something, but I ended up giving my fries to my son, who got a double burger meal, and kept that burger close by and unrefrigerated, and nibbled on it over 5hrs til it was GONE! These guys know how to grill a cheeseurger! At roughly $10. for the meal it was worth it, our total bill= $25 for 2 meals...they're cheesburgers, people!! Still, I'd probably go back for a good burger when I have that hankering for an AWESOME cheeseburger. The wheat bun, very good! Fries were only warm, and we were the only ones IN the restaurant, but I was tired and let them slide over the burger being my main focus and knowing my son will eat anything.  The restaurant is spic-n-span clean! The employees very personable; all of them, and talked to us; didn't just answer questions. Next time, because of my gastric surgery, I'll be getting a kids meal, but these burgers are EXCELLENT tasting and I bet we will become frequent flyers here. Note: It IS expensive...not a one $ buger....NOT a fast food restaurant. I was SO burger focused I did not even see what elsewas on the menu...OOPS!",

My first bite was with everything and it seemed salty so I scrapped off the extras and took off the bread and just tried the burger, turns out it was the burger itself that was overly salty, in fact so salty there was no other taste coming through.

Our daughter ordered a shake and immediately declared it the best ever.  My husband ordered the double burger with blue cheese raved about the flavor as well as all the options available for toppings.  All in all a fabulous add to Sycamore Commons and we couldn't be more thrilled.",

My son also got a banana milkshake, that he enjoyed.  Unfortunately... he also came away with what we assume to be food poisoning. Stomach was upset almost immediately after eating, then spent the day in bed and in the bathroom.  I understand food prep is a tricky business, and there are going to be instances like this, even in the most sanitary conditions, but it certainly makes me wary of a second visit.",

Was in there recently during an NFL playoff game and hey we're showing some obscure basketball game. I asked if someone had requested the game and if not could we switch it to the NFL. The server informed me that the TV never moved from that channel so either they have only 1 channel or the owner doesn't want to be bothered with switching back and forth.",

The seasoning on the sweet fries was great, and the wheat bun was a nice option. Still not in love with the name...

Mooyah just hasn't found that \"thing\" yet, as clearly demonstrated during our visit.   Sure, the restaurant was clean, the workers were friendly, blah blah blah. What frustrated me was that during our visit, the second register was not opened even though the couple in front of us was taking a long time to make up their minds. We probably stood in line a solid five minutes while three people stood behind the grill (two workers too many), and another worker was just standing around, trying (in vain) to look busy. It would not have been an issue to open another register and take our order. The man in front of us apologized, and I should have told him that it wasn't his fault that we were still standing there.   I hope the management can train up their employees to function as a team and recognize the needs of customers, so that future visits are more pleasant. Good customer service will make Mooyah more enjoyable to visit; after all, I can get a decent cheeseburger almost anywhere.",

The burgers are juicier, the fries are amazing (especially the sweet potato fries) and the shakes are delicious. There are so many more options than you can find at Five Guys as well. Our first visit, I had the \"Crandidate\" (a Turkey burger especially for this election year) and was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. My son got a hot dog and, not only is the dog itself yummy, the bun is fresh and delicious. On our next visit I got a burger (the Well D'Onion to be exact) and was absolutely blown away. Seriously, if you live close enough to have the decision in where you go for your burgers out, check out Mooyah. I'm hooked!",

A couple of other guests came in while I ate but 3 tables  was the max number  of guests.   I ordered the Mooyah  with cheese (and extra seasoning thanks to other reviews) with Cheddar , bacon, mushrooms , onions, and BBQ sauce. The bun is way too small for the burger. The toppings were kinda tossed under the patty, some here and some there. I actually  took it apart to spread the toppings out before I ate it. The flavor  was....well...BBQ sauce. The little drizzle  was the only flavor to the whole thing (even with \"extra seasoning\").   The fries were actually  really good . They are hand cut and made in-house . This is a huge pluse. They were seasoned well and we're not too limp or overly crisp.  I also order a strawberry  milkshake . I think  they forgot the milk  part. It is hand-spun  which is nice but without the milk I just got a cup of ice cream  with strawberry sauce .  Everyone  working seemed bored but I guess that is to be expected when you have almost no guests.  Overall not horrible but just a mid-range burger place. There are better  options for the prices.",

She stated that this burger is the in a TIE if not leading 5Guy burger. I for one do appreciate the BlackBean Garden Burger option as it is served between iceberg lettuce with a spicy mayo and swiss cheese. The fries are fresh cut which is always a plus and the staff is friendly. I did have one issue this past weekend when my family and I checked this place out (took my husband and toddler for the first time). My son had the children tenders and he kept pushing them away saying NO and I continued to try to break them up to feed him and while breaking one up my finger got slimey and it was like some slime inside the tender which was so GROSS, it looked horribly disgusting. So basically it's not Chick-Fil-A tenders, the manager was great at accessing the issue and offering something else which we opted out of the chicken as we don't usually get chicken tenders out (besides Chick-Fil-A once in a blue moon) and asked for a grill cheese as you can't go wrong with a grill cheese with cheddar cheese. The wall BlackBoard is cool, it's a HUGE chalkboard wall and there is a huge silver bucket with chalk in it for doodling while waiting.",

    "text": "Like the concept... however, when I visited... I was the only one in the restaurant.  Could have been a fluke, but there were more employees than customers.  Was greeted very nicely upon entering and I wasn't familiar with the way things worked here but the nice young lady that was cleaning off tables walked me through the menu and took my order up at the counter.  1:  Pick your meat 2:  Pick  your bread 3: Add your toppings  4:  Choose any sides.  Simple enough.  I tried a turkey burger on a wheat bun with fries.  They cooked it fresh and it was brought out to me... probably if the place were busier, I would have had to retrieve the burger from the pass, but the manager brought it to me.  I think what was comical was when I put my order in, there were about four employees watching the one employee make my burger on the flattop.  The dining room, while empty, was casual and relaxed... clean tables with some modern metal cow-themed decorations on the wall.  Looks like this is a national franchise and this is the first location (maybe trying to test out the NC market).  I'd say this place is trying to be a Five Guys with a bit of Shake Shack, but hopefully their business picks up, otherwise, I don't see them lasting very long.",

    "text": "We were doing some shopping in Matthews and stumbled upon Mooyah when we were looking for something small to eat.  I was pleased to see that Mooyah let you pick whatever kind of burger you wanted (be it beef, turkey, veggie, or even hot dog) and then pile whatever you wanted onto it without nickel-and-diming you for every item.  Forget Burger King, this is truly \"Have it your way.\"    I opted for something spicy, so I picked the turkey burger with Buffalo sauce, chunky blue cheese, jalapenos, and crispy onions.  Instead of a bun, I tried the lettuce wrap version.  What I got was something amazing.  The burger was very flavorful, and all of my selected toppings complemented one another.  The crispy onions gave it some crunch.  My lettuce \"wrap\" was several layers of iceberg lettuce on either side of the burger, forming its own \"bun.\"  Everything about it was perfect.  Since we were eating \"light,\" we didn't try any sides, like the French fries, but they looked awesome from what we saw on other tables.  They looked fresh cut with the skins on.    It was such a nice day that nobody was eating inside the restaurant (although they have a good size dining room).  Everyone was enjoying eating outdoors, which they have plenty of seating for.    We'll definitely go back when we're shopping in that area.  The prices and food were both great.  I'm not going to lie, though.  I'm probably going to get the exact same thing because it was such a delicious combination.",

It was delicious! The lettuce held up well to the burger and everything was cooked perfectly. I loved the crisp, fresh lettuce! Such a refreshing, tasty alternative to a bun. The fries were crispy with a little spice - maybe the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Also, the onion straws were so good I had to wonder why they weren't a side. They added the perfect crunch to my burger and had such great flavor.   My husband tried a beef burger & admitted he preferred it to 5 Guys.   The staff was very nice and accommodating. I left my purse on my chair as we left and we went back to get it...as soon as I walked in, I was handed my purse as if they were waiting for me, and they were busy! They were so sweet & helpful. Overall - between the food & service, I'll be back for sure!  Cons (just to be honest): Avoid the chicken, stick with veggie burger, red meat or turkey burger.  The chicken texture & way it's fried isn't as appealing as other options.",

You put in your order up front and your check # is called when your order is ready. There are many different kinds of burgers to choose from. In spite of my intentions to get a burger I could not resist the Nathan's Hot Dog with chili. The hot dog was split and served on a soft potato bun. It was incredible! My dining partner chose a burger and declared it delicious. She also mentioned how good the bun was. Both of us were only disappointed in the fact that the buns felt cold which was a sharp contrast to the warm meat and fillings. We both recommend that there be some attention paid to that to enhance the flavor and enjoyment of the food. We shared an order of french fries which were as close to homemade as you can get. The dining area is bright and roomy with several types of seating. The staff was friendly efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. I hope to return soon for a burger.",

My mom said the burger was good, but the pictures of the burger displayed everywhere at the restaurant display a burger topped high with friend onion straws which is not even close to what we received. There were maybe 4 little pieces and that was it. It was so disappointing because over and over my mom said \"that was the whole reason I got this burger and wanted to come here!\" The regular fans sweet potato fries were great and the servers were all super friendly!! Only complaint was the False advertising of what one of their best burgers actually was!",

She loves to try new things and this was going to be a new thing for the both of us.   When we came here, it was not busy at all. It was in the middle of the day. When we walked in, there were only 2 tables occupied. The gentlemen taking our order was super patient with us. We had no idea what to get and figuring it out took longer than expected.   I ordered the black bean veggie burger with regular fries. My sister ordered a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. She ordered a chocolate shake and I ordered the cookies and cream shake.   The food and shakes came out in decent time. They brought it right to our table. The black bean burger was not the best. It was lacking seasoning. It was very dry. There are better places to have a veggie burger. It was worth a try though! The regular fries were amazing. Those were well seasoned. My sister loved her burger. It was juicy and made perfectly. She found the sweet potato fries to be seasoned with a weird seasoning. I tried some and I agreed. Nothing wrong with them. Just a weird flavor to them. The shakes were nothing special. I was not a fan of the super wide straws that they serve the shakes with. Super strange and difficult to use.   I plan to come back and try a different burger. I am not a full vegetarian but I tend to choose veggie over meat if it's available. I like the idea of being able to have a burger anyway you want it. That's a unique feature that this restaurant has to offer.",

    "text": "Walked in to a pretty much empty restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night, but it was raining so tried not to read to much into it.  Cashier looked like she would rather be anywhere but there as her enthusiasm level was about a -3 on a scale of 1-10.  Fries were fine but burger seasoning was too salty for my taste.    Not a fan of the flattened down burger concept that seems to be popuythese days, as I prefer a nice juicy burger over a flat, overly seasoned and overly cooked tasting one, but to each his own.    Maybe the rain wasn't the reason for the lack of a crowd on a Saturday night after all, who knows, but won't be going back as there are too many options out there to settle for \"just ok\".",

    "text": "So many options to appease even the pickiest eater, that would be me :)  GLUTEN FREE, no problem, there is a well built lettuce bun for any burger item , or gluten free buns! Do you realize how happy this made me feel , it is so hard to find burger spots that offer gluten free buns.   What we ordered:  -Farmers burger: Vegan, black bean burger on a lettuce wrap with a side of sweet potato fries -A1 Burger- name speaks for itself -Kids Grilled cheese with apple sauce ( my 2year old killed this)  What we liked: EVERYTHING, from the fast and friendly service, the size of each burger and side, the taste, and the prices. This is my new favorite spot for burgers , non-gmo potato buns for each burger or you can also do wheat ... like I said plenty of options.  I wasn't able to try any of the other menu items but I did see chili chees fries, and milk shakes.   Mooyah definitely exceeded my expectations , so long five guys... and don't forget to ring the bell before you leave If you received good service, we sure did .",

The atmosphere is very casual, fun and eccentric, with vibrant colors and an area you can watch your food being cooked. I ordered a Morningstar black bean burger on iceberg lettuce (along with other toppings and condiments) and it was pretty big to me, I couldn't finish it. I appreciated that the burger was securely placed inside the lettuce and wasn't sliding everywhere or crumbling apart on my hands. The french fries were ok, lightly salted, no other seasonings on them - looks like some of them had grill marks on them, so not exactly sure how they are cooked. The prices are a little on the higher end (average burger price is greater than $6), but it may be due to the popular location. All in all, it was a good experience.   Pictured also is a mushroom Swiss burger and chili-cheese hotdog.",

The bun was slightly toasted and just right. There's an option to \"build your own burger\" or you can pick from a variety of choices. They have a bun less burger option for those watching your carbs. My friend ordered fries and a strawberry milkshake and loved them both!",

I was put on hold for 20 minutes and when I finally arrived they picked up and hung up on me. That's when I asked about the hold up and the manager just snapped saying there was a line. When I arrived there was no line. Plus that's not the right way to answer my reasonable question. To me customer service is everything and if they can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen!!!   The food wasn't for me thank god because I probably wouldn't trust it after the way they got so defensive.   When I finally got the food the lady was nice yet no respect from the manager.",

Their meat has a flavor that no one else can imitate. If you enjoy five guys, highway 55, or bad daddy's; I can assure that you'll love this place. Their \"MOOYAH sauce\" is different, but is an amazing condiment. If you're in the area it's definitely worth the visit.  Side note: The reason I can't give MOOYAH 5 stars is due to the young man behind the counter talking very loudly about death and hospice care to his fellow co-workers. This wasn't something my girlfriend and I wanted to hear about while eating and I'm sure the only other couple in there didn't want to hear about it either.",

He then turns around and makes a mistake of his own. Mustache guy then refuses to correct his mistake - my order - which was just simply cheap fries on a platter. I got a half empty cup of fries in a to-go bag instead.  The mistake wasn't the problem - it was this petty guys refusal to accept blame and remedy the problem so my order was correct.",
