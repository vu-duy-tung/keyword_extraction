We had seen Bonsai Fusion Sushi but we were a bit skeptical of how good it would be... for whatever reason.  We recently bit the bullet and tried it out....and it was fantastic!  The ingredients were so fresh and the two chefs/owners are great guys and always very accommodating (especially since I live north of Charlotte and often can't get down to the market until close to closing time).   So far we have only had a few of the more traditional rolls but we are looking forward to trying one of the many delicious sounding signature rolls.  My daughter now craves their sushi and looks forward to our weekly pilgrimage.....just one more reason why we love the 7th Street Market.",

Some sushi background may be in order.I'd eaten a lot of sushi and enjoyed it almost everywhere, but that changed pretty dramatically the first time I had the assorted sushi plate at \"japanese i.\" When I tasted my first bite I almost said ewww. That piece of sushi had such a dramatic flavor, in fact every piece of that nigiri-zushi plate was as  singular in taste as wines made from different varietals, actually even more so. \"Japanese i,\" had become the standard (fairly or not) by which all other sushi is compared. I got the lunch special with the following rolls: salmon, tuna and yellowtail with avocado. The rolls were competently made; they didn't fall apart when I ate them. They all fell within the \"they mostly tasted alike\" category which  is the largest sushi category in the Charlotte area. The servings were generous; I would have been full on two rolls.The accompanying soy sauce was the saltiest I'd ever tasted - very little subtlety there.  All in all, a poor experience and even though I'm curious about the beautiful and expensive fusion rolls, I'm reluctant to go given my lunch experience. After all, it's all about the quality of the fish, and the fish here was mediocre. \"Japanese i\" is now closed, a casualty of the recession.",

Some of the rolls are more imaginative than others such as some sort of roll with mango and shrimp tempura. The guy making my sushi was super nice and when he noticed that I wanted to go find join my friends at the table offered to send it to me once it's finished if I wanted to sit down!  Ultimately the problem lies in the rolls they have on offer. They're forgettable sadly enough. The quality is okay, the price is okay, the creativity is okay and so this place gets rated as an okay place.",

I ordered the Kani Salad, great ginger dressing, and the Top Gun Roll, which was probably was of the best spicy tuna rolls, topped with tuna, salmon, and hamachi, in Charlotte.  The reason I am giving it a 4, and not a five, two things stick out. First, the roll was a little small, 6 pieces, for $12?  And, I am not a typical person to complain about the price of sushi, but $18 for lunch, and it only 6 rolls and a salad, seemed a little high, when other sushi places in downtown offer a roll, salad, and egg roll for less than $10.  I would definitely go back, but will be sure not to get suckered on the speciality rolls, but rather try some of the lunch specials others mentioned in their reviews. Overall, great sushi!",

I usually go for standard fare - basic sushi rolls and sashimi.  I think I might have to break free of this habit and try the other things on the menu like their specialty rolls or their burrito.  As for the time... they are staffed until right before 5pm (I asked one weekday) even though the 7th Street Market is open until 7pm.  Very friendly, they offered to make  my take home if I call them around 4:30.  And it would be ready for me to pick up at 5pm. (I work right across the street from them.)  Love it.  I should get that number for you off of my desk at work...  Extra perks: the personable staff, the 10% off BofA discount, the free parking with validation.",

Excellent roll options - my fav is the Godzilla (with cream cheese which is 50 cents extra).      They have lunch specials and discounts for some employers like Bank of America ec.

The two staff members that served us were so funny and personable.  They held a conversation with us for almost the entire time we were there!  The sushi prices were great.  In fact, it was so cheap, my friend and I ended up with too much food.  Thankfully, they have boxes and chopsticks to go!  The sushi tasted good but it wasn't the best I've had.  However, I think sushi is always relative to price.  So if you're not wanting to spend a lot but want a decent roll - stop in here!    Added bonus - the 7th Street Market, which is where Bonsai Fusion is located, will validate parking for up to 90 minutes.  Make sure to bring your parking ticket in with you and stop by the door on the way out to swipe it in the machine!  I also enjoyed that after our meal, we were able to stroll around the market and pick up a few items.  Overall, it was a very pleasurable experience!",

We took advantage of the three roll lunch special for $11 - but I wish we had went with two for $9, because it was way too much food for my dining partner and I (we had six total)...I was stuffed, and we had a lot leftover! These were pretty basic rolls, but the sushi was fresh and they honored my request of keeping the tuna whole (not a fan of the chopped type).   I will say next time I may get some of the other special roll options because the rest were pretty basic, I like a little something extra in mine. I may also check out the burrito since it looked pretty awesome.   The rule to remember with parking: it's validated for 90 minutes BUT*** you do not validate it until you're ready to leave or you'll run out of time, they only give you 20 minutes to leave after it's validated. There is a machine by the door next to Bonsai (ask and they'll point you in the right direction).",

They make up for their small bar with huge smiles, generous rolls, and gigantic flavors that will make your tastebuds do somersaults!  There was a fantastic special running when I was there: 2 rolls for $8 or 3 for $11. Hello, sushi for a steal of a deal! The sushi is creatively named, inspired by the 80's. Ask for the Blue Velvet! Nobu and his business partner do a fantastic job and put out some of the most delicious sushi I have ever eaten. They are very creative...have you ever had a sushi sandwich? I hadn't until my stop here and it was delightful.  If you love sushi, you will want to come here. Don't let the casual and small space deceive you, it worth it's taste in gold!",

    "text": "This is my go to recommendation for out of town guest (as is the 7th street market in general).  This place is the definition of bang for your buck!  I would put their quality of sushi with that of any in Charlotte and their prices are half that of the other top ones.  Their lunch special is 2 rolls for $10 or 3 for $13 if you want to fat boy it up!  But my go to is the Sushi Burrito and they recently expanded to several other options (although the OG Hulk is still my favorite or the Hulk Smash if you are fan of spice).  If you are intimidated by the burrito- you can get it in the bowl and it is less messy but just as amazing.  If you haven't tried this place out- go today!",

Me and this one stylish (and cool!) chick grabbed lunch here on a Thursday afternoon.  I ordered the 9-piece sashimi lunch special - 3 pieces of tuna,  3 pieces of salmon and 3 pieces of white tuna.  All for me!  It was a little pricey at $14, but I guess you pay for quality.  To be fair, quality is good compared to the rest of Charlotte.  CA still has the best sashimi/sushi available on LOCK DOWN.    The dudes that own the place are friendly and nice.  No complaints there.  If I have a hankering for sashimi mid-day, I know where I'm headed.  dmo out.",

After reading many reviews about many of the sushi restaurants and gathering that many Yelpers were disappointed in the freshness of food... I chose Bonsai Fusion after seeing that many reviewers complimented Bonsai's \"fresh\" sushi. I thought the restauraunt would be stand alone but it was actually in a very cool indoor marketplace w/ several other small eatteries. There's a big wall next to the small sushi hut that has pictures of all the specialty rolls and they're contents. 6 or 7 seats sit in front of the sushi chefs that are very friendly and prepare your food. The sushi is presented in an aluminum container that serves as a throw away container or a to-go container w/ lid. The sushi was very fresh and much to my liking. I highly recommend this spot!",

Case in point, the Twins roll at Bonsai...   Shrimp tempura inside topped with shrimp and fresh mango finished off with a refreshingly light pineapple aioli... Did that sound mindblowingly delectable?  Because it was...  With the sriracha and soy sauce sidecars?  I was incredibly impressed... All of the ingredients were light and fresh... I'm going to Captain Obvious it right now and say that wasabi was blazing hot... I loved it!    I'm not sure how pricing goes because as I said, I'm not up on the cuisine, but $9 for this roll seemed fair... I was full, but not sluggish and that's the best way to finish a meal when you have things to do afterward...  The boyfriend's not really into sushi either...

When I got to the stand, it was awkward because no one greeted me for over five minutes and a couple was sitting right in front of the register.  When my friend joined me, he was surprised I wasn't already waiting for my food.  When I did order, I thought the rolls would take maybe ten minutes to make.  There hadn't been anyone in front of me and the chef was talking to the couple at the counter who were eating.  Another guy kept assuring me it would be \"just a minute\", but over 15 minutes came and went.  Finally, they suggested I have a seat and they would bring it to me.  I pointed to a table outside and told them I would be there, which both staff acknowledged.  I waited forever outside too.  I finally went back in to cancel my order and the guy handed me a to-go bag and was like, \" oh we couldn't find you.\"  2 rolls took about 40 minutes to finally get to me.  Won't be returning.",

These guys are a small setup, right next to Tasty Yo, in the market with an easily readable menu. Not too short and not too long. They have all of your favorites -- California, Spicy Tuna, veggie and so on. I really dig that they have lunch specials. Sometimes I'm in the mood for old reliable, but there are times I'm looking to be blown away by something I've never had before. That's what happened this week...  Two words: Sushi Burrito. Holy mess this thing is amazing. Spicy tuna, avocado, all of the regular sushi veg, rice, and a brilliant chipotle-honey sauce rolled up in a tortilla. Absolutely fantastic flavors. When I was in San Fran, there is a place that specializes in sushi burritos, and I wish I had a chance to try it. This totally satiated my hunger! Would love to see this on rice paper or a large nori wrapper instead of a flour tortilla. Maybe soon!   Prices are fair. Around $9 for lunch. Bonsai has totally won my trust and patronage. Can't wait to go back!",

They offer a variety of beverages from the drink cooler.  You can sit at their bar or sit at the tables within 7th Street Market.  Prices are reasonable & fall in line with what you'd expect from regular sushi restaurants.

My other go-to is an order of tuna and salmon sashimi.  They always have high quality, nicely colored, and flavorful fish.   Very friendly staff - grab some Saki from Assorted Table (also inside the market) and sit at one of the five sushi barstools and watch them work their magic!",

I got the small salmon poke bowl which had salmon, mangos and avocados in it. It was really good! At first glance, I thought I wouldn't keep me full since it was so small but surprisingly it was just enough and not cause me to overeat.   Pros- Very flavorful. The salmon was fresh, mangos were sweet, and avocados were just ripe.   Cons- $8 for a small poke bowl is a bit expensive. The large is $14.",

Ignoring the opinion of a friend who mentioned this place was not good, I went to try out their poke bowl. I got the large salmon poke bowl, and for $15 I was thinking this may be a great deal. Now...if you've ever had a good poke bowl, I'm going to go ahead and say avoid this place at all costs.   When the bowl was handed to me, I was kind of shocked that they decided to pair mango with the salmon, on a bed of rice. It was as horrid as you may think it sounds. The combination was just not floating my taste buds. Eating each item in the bowl separately seemed to help a bit, but I have to note as well that the salmon was very subpar. I'm pretty sure I've had better salmon from the prepared sushi section in a grocery store. Anyways, maybe their sushi rolls or burritos are better, but I wouldn't spend money here again to try that theory out.",

I guess I just assumed that it being located within the public market would somehow make it special, but it failed to stand out from the crowd of uptown sushi places.  I ordered the Terminator Roll. It's not even listed on the website menu (which is True of a few of the other specialty rolls as well). If I recall correctly, it had shrimp tempura inside and spicy crab salad, fried shallots, and kabayaki sauce on top.  To be fair, my main complaint with this place was not the quality, but rather the price...After tax it came to almost $12 for 8 average-sized pieces. I just think there are much better options for $12. Having said all that, I'll probably cave and give it another shot one day.",

    "text": "Was in Charlotte for a convention over the weekend. Charlotte or \"uptown Charlotte\" does not have that many dining options like a normal city would. Most are either bars or \"high-end\" catering to the moneyed finance and banking industry folks.  Thus, it was nice to see the 7th St, Market, -- a food hall that Charlotte is trying to emulate from other cities. Again, much like Charlotte itself,not that many options -- mostly pizzas and pastas and bars. So, I was glad to see they have sushi palce! Sat down at the counter, and as soon as I sat down, guy with the bandana (pictured by one of the Yelpers here, Lauren S, and here's the link of that self-important and disdainful \"sushi chef\" <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bonsai-fusion-charlotte-2?select=upHktVLERX03noz7kV7slQ&reviewid=x4DxzRxSRHstMvGJE72_FQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bons...</a>) asked me, \"can I get you anything\" in a very threatening and unwelcoming voice. I just sat down, and is it okay to look a the menu first (up in the board above them), I say to him. So, he said go ahead! And when I ordered and he asked if there was anything else, I said no, nothing else as I was planning to get my drink somewhere else ( to which he murmured and mocked what I just said under his breath). When the sushi rolls were served to me by their server, a young bearded hipster who thinks he is the hippest and coolest person around, he looked me up and down, and just placed the rolls in front of me aggressively.  As for the sushi itself, nothing spectacular or ordinary even. It has the look of  sushi roll, but tasteless or flavorless. It's like a copy of what a sushi must be.   I must also add that while I was at the counter, they were making fun of the people in the Market (this was St. Patrick's Day) and they're saying that everyone thinks they're Irish or white on St. Patrick's Day when they are neither of those two.  I doubt that my review will make a difference and impact to this place, since this is only the affordable sushi option in uptown Charlotte, and must get packed during lunch hour for the green bankers, who think this is the best sushi one could have. The place reeks of arrogance, which understandable since they cater mostly to arrogant finance industry .",

I decided to order the sushi burrito. After I ordered, they gave me a card to put on the table I was sitting at so that they can bring it out to me when it was ready. Took about 10 minutes or so, which was very quick.  The sushi burrito was in a spinach wrap and had spicy tuna, edamame hummus, lettuce, msc veggies, rice, some kind of sauce, and jalapenos. Great size portion and very filling. Next time, I am ordering sans jalapeno because that thing was spicy!! This burrito was so tasty and I thought the spicy tuna in it was very fresh tasting. Definitely will be ordering again!",

The flavors work well, but I would still prefer the nori wrap over the tortilla. Also, I do think that the price for the poke bowls was a bit much.",

The sushi fish is fresh, the service is quick, and it's a good value for the food you get (2 rolls for $10.50).   I have had their sushi burrito, and it's tasty, but I'm honeslty a huge fan of their rolls. They have some delicious speciality rolls (top gun roll) that are amazing combinations of fish and veggies. Their staple rolls are also delicious, and are good sized rolls. I use the spicy tuna roll as my judge for all sushi spots and I love that bonsai's is all chopped tuna with the perfect balance of heat and spice. It's not just a dollop of siracha (sp?) on some fish, but rather a blend of spice within the roll.   The hours are different than listed though, we went last week and they didn't open until 11:30, so just check before you venture over. But go early, because they do get busy!",

My coworker wanted to go here for a sushi burrito which was something I hadn't tried yet. He didn't have to twist my arm, I was up for the culinary adventure. I got one that had spicy tuna and mayo. Most of them come with certain veggies like lettuce and I was weary of beets, but there wasn't a lot of it. Of course there's rice and your choice of spinach wrap or nori. I went for the spinach wrap.   When I got my burrito, I was impressed with the size. It was larger than I expected and had a good bit of tuna. The flavor was amazing. There's several sauces used and every bite was an adventure. There was crunch from the veggies that added great texture. I tasted a spicy mayo, cilantro and sweet sauce. I would definitely order again.   The only hiccup was that when it comes out, it's wrapped in foil and when it was sliced in half, I had to pick off some small bits of foil.   Bonsai Fusion is in 7th Street Public Market. During lunchtime, it's a bit crowded as multiple restaurants are there and everyone shares seating. If it's nice out, you can sit outside and watch people on the rail.",

Of the 10 items listed as being inside the wrap, it was missing 6 of them.  Seriously the worst thing I've eaten in months.  I threw it in the trash.  Should have asked for my money back.",

I highly suggest ordering the \"Top Gun\" which consists of a spicy tuna roll topped with tuna, salmon yellowtail and avocado.  I have also tried to salmon & avocado roll. The fish is so fresh and delicious! During lunch hours (11a-2:30p), they offer certain rolls at a special price of 2 for $10.",

Not seeing a roll on the menu I wanted, I asked if I could build my own. A nice young lady took my order - a shrimp tempura roll with avocado and cucumber, topped with salmon, eel sauce and spicy mayo. Once she wrote it down, she talked in a huddle (no lie) with the three other employees about what to charge me. They settled on $13, which seemed kinda steep to me but I had high hopes.   I had a seat and after a few minutes, my roll was brought out. I was underwhelmed just looking at it. The presentation wasn't great and it seemed kinda small. Also, half of the pieces had salmon on top and have had avocado. The taste of the roll wasn't memorable.   I wasn't blown away by the taste, the presentation or the price. I don't see myself going back here. I can go to cowfish or eez and pay $13 for a roll that is tastier and an overall better value.",

    "text": "I was recommended to check this place out as the GF had a craving for some sushi burrito/poke. So, Bonsai Fusion it was, and on top of that I thought there was going to be free parking so we got there roughly around 10. Surprisingly, when everything opened up (and Bonsai opened up at 11) I found out that the parking is only good for 90 minutes. You're probably wondering where to scan it. It's actually part of the bakery restaurant. You go up there scan it and it says validated. OKAY... to Bonsai!  So I ordered two things. A small tuna/salmon Poke and a sushi burrito. I believe this sushi burrito included spicy salmon and tuna. Anyways, they were great. I thought both were fresh and it  was filling.  The burrito was wrapped in a spinach tortilla which to me was interesting. It was different as my previous experience it was wrapped in nori. I'm thinking it's wrapped this way so it doesn't get soggy. Makes sense. Even if it id get soggy I think I would have still preferred the nori.  Soy sauce was offered, but I found that I didn't really need it with the burrito and I was quite satisfied that eating it by itself was worth it.   The seating around this place are plentiful, but if you want to sit at the bar there's a very limited amount of seating. Definitely a place that is an in and out. I think it works as a take out spot and should be on your list if you're a sushi/burrito/poke lover. I know there are new places opening up in Charlotte soon, but this will be a good comparison to start off on.",

    "text": "Bonsai Fusion is the reason I became a regular at Seventh Street Market. They have got the best sushi in Charlotte. A sushi roll or two from here is perfect for a quick bite, the staff is friendly and super fast and accommodating every time I stop by. I usually order their super fresh and skillfully prepared avocado cucumber roll, it's a steal for $5.50 a roll and is just enough food to fill me up. Parking at the Market is easy validated when you purchase your food and it's right off the highway so it is a must try in uptown, super convenient.  Edit the young black dude who always wears a hat is the only bad thing about this place. He has zero customer service skills, is rude and yells crazy loud across the building in front of customers",

I wanted to try something different than the standard roll so I tried the salmon poke bowl that comes with salmon, avocado, and mango on a bed of rice. Don't let the mango make you think twice about this dish as it is a complement to the other flavors. I will definitely try the tuna poke next time!",

There is a parking deck connected to it and they validate parking for 90 minutes.  We order the OG Hulk burrito and the ET roll with two drinks.  There was only one sushi chef working so it took a while to get our food.  They were really polite and told us they were short staffed today.  The burrito was AMAZING.  We will definitely be back for another one to have individually.  The portion was big and it was very flavorful.  The ET roll was amazing as well but was a very very small portion compared to other sushi places we go to.  Next time we come we will each get the burrito and bring our own waters in or grab a beer from another shop in the market.",

Bonsai is in a very convenient location, the quality of the fish is okay, the flavor is where it lacks to me. I give them 3 stars because they are fast and a great location if you work in Uptown. I definitely don't go outta my way to eat here, it's a little pricy for me given the flavor.",

Just before noon, there were only 2 people ahead of me waiting for food and tables available inside.  By 12:15, it had gotten quite a bit busier.    I ordered my sushi burrito and took a seat.  It was delivered to my table in about 10 minutes with a scoop of wasabi and some pickled ginger.  This \"burrito\" was delicious.  It was packed full of tuna and veggies - the flavors blended nicely and the wasabi and soy sauce complemented the giant sushi roll well.  It was more than enough for a meal - I left feeling quite full.  Overall, wonderful experience!",

I mean, I will literally walk in circles around the market two or three times, hemming and hawing. #firstworldproblems   More often than not, I land at Bonsai for their wonderful sushi. (That is, when I don't get a crepe. Or, a pizza. Or, a grilled cheese. See what I mean? Lunch time decisions are hard!) Anywho, when Bonsai is your choice, you can't really go wrong with anything on their menu. All of the speciality rolls are great, albeit just a dollar or two over priced. I have dreams about that sushi burrito. The seaweed salad is delicious. Their lunch special (two rolls for $9.00) is great.   Bonsai is a wonderful addition to the cool, vibrant 7th Street Market!",
