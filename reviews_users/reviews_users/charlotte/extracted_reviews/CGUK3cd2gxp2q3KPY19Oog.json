    "text": "Got stuck in Charlotte at the Holiday Inn Airport when I missed my connection. This cafe showed up on yelp when I looked for breakfast near the hotel. It was a 15 min drive (only like a $10 Uber) and so worth it.  I got the breakfast burrito which was delicious, (especially the aioli). The cafe is small and really cozy. I stayed there for a few hours checking emails on my computer and no one asked me to leave; quite the opposite, they were so friendly and kept refilling my water!   What a nice introduction to Charlotte. If I lived anywhere near here, I would definitely come back! Would recommend to anyone in the area looking for coffee/mimosas/breakfast.",

I had the pleasure of enjoying the croissant, it had the right amount of flakiness and was bigger than expected.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back.

We found Roots cafe and they have great coffee and a quality lunch menu. I had the coconut milk latte with cold brew coffee. It was amazing and strong and lovely flavors of coconut! The turkey sandwich had goat cheese (my favorite food) and pickled red onions and cucumber and it was delicious! I have never liked onions but pickled red onion, with the turkey and goat cheese was yummy. Each sandwich comes with a side, I chose the pickled cucumbers, nice flavor. They also have wine and beer and kombucha, so I must return. The vibe at 11 a.m. was cozy and private and great for conversations. The parking lot is tiny but it seems like you can park on the street too. Service was great, awesome people !!  I had previously eaten their catering food at a Christmas party so I knew they had good eats!",

Wonderful to know the food is local- you could definitely taste the difference. Aaron took our order- he was terrific:)",

She was excited to take us to breakfast at this cute trendy spot, but our  trip to Roots was anything but positive.    It's a tiny place with just a few tables so, upon entering we were trying to decide if we should stay or go, as there were no open tables.  This must have annoyed the gentleman at the counter, so we went ahead and ordered.  We asked a couple of questions about the menu, and that obviously annoyed him, as well.  He was incredibly pushy, rude and condescending -  and definitely killed the mood of our fun breakfast out.  I felt sorry for my daughter, who was embarrassed by what was happening, so we tried to make the best of it.  However, I can't give a positive due to the extremely poor service.  Bottom line, I spent $14 on two tiny breakfast tacos and a basic drip-brewed coffee in addition to receiving horrible service.  Roots needs to coach their employees to offer a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere to their customers as there are way too many other better restaurant options nearby.  Needless to say,  we'll all be finding a friendlier place to enjoy breakfast next time.",

Inside hasn't changed too much; there is still a 7-seat bar and then several 4 or 5-top tables. Weekends are brunch only, but until 3pm. Roots maybe my new brunch go to.  The lunch menu is mostly split between sandwiches and salads plus side items. Everything sounds great. I had the capresse salad; it was beautifully presented and tasty. Heirloom tomatoes make the difference. I guess the rest of the menu is equally good. The evening fare is small bites and I intend to try them all.  Coffee looks like a big seller - for the breakfast menu plus you can buy a monthly coffee subscription. They have a good wine selection plus 6 beers on tap.  The little things like getting a pitcher of water when you sit down is nice and makes the difference. The staff are super friendly and helpful.",

Turkey wrap was tasty with brown mustard, Gouda cheese and onion.  Chicken and dumplings were ok, smallish dumplings and could have used a bit more seasoning.  I took home a savory scone for hubby who devoured it.  Would recommend this place and will go back again.",

The food was good, the people were nice but we had to find a spot to eat, grab some silverware from another table and wait about 40 minutes for the most basic breakfast on earth... eggs, bacon and potatoes ... the food was just ok. Not bad not Great just ok ... we had to ask what the eta on our food was but right after that it came out ... i would give this a four because seems like most ppl were having a good time and we just had a slightly poorer than usual experience.",

I ordered a small skim cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso. This was the first place where I didn't need to order the extra shot.

After looking up some cafes close to me, I found Roots. Their Breakfast Burrito on their brunch menu looked like it would satisfy my craving. So, I called in on the way to place an order for the Breakfast Burrito and an Almond Milk Chai Latte. After arriving, I was pleasantly surprised by the charming oasis tucked away off South Boulevard. Once I gave her my name the barista immediately starting making my chai latte (which I was worried would be cold since I ordered for pick up)! She took no time at all, then I was out of there with a fresh, hot latte and food. When I got home and took a bite of the colorful burrito, I was in AWE! It was so delicious with the potato hash, corn, quinoa, spinach and chili aioli; an amazing flavor combination! I will definitely be going back for a sit down brunch very soon.",

    "text": "Came into Roots today for brunch with some friends. I've visited the cafe a couple times for coffee and have always been pretty pleased. Today, however, was a little different. I placed my order at the counter, ordering the special and breakfast tacos. The special, was a Torta Espanola, so, being of Hispanic decent, I ordered it pronouncing the item in Spanish. The gentleman at the counter, who I have seen multiple times before, gave me the most incredulous, condescending attitude as he answered \"so you want the special\" - yes, I ordered the special the way you have it listed on the menu.   I then asked about the \"Cubano con leche\" that was listed on the HOT coffee menu and found out it was hot coffee poured into COLD milk. When I asked why, the same gentleman at the register said, \"Cubans don't like hot coffee\". Being Cuban myself, I'm not entirely sure where he developed this notion that we don't like hot coffee, because every single version of Cuban coffee is served PIPING HOT. And to continue down the condescending path he was headed, he then asked \"have you ever been to Miami?\" - I chuckled, and answered, \"yes, I was actually born and raised in Miami, both my parents are Cuban and I promise you, we don't drink our coffee cold\".  His response? \"Glad you made it out (of Cuba)\"   I write all of this to say that today, after having moved to Charlotte just 14 months ago from Miami, was the first time I have encountered such a rude individual in the customer service industry. I doubt we will ever return to Roots. There is no place for such an attitude. The food was not terrible, so I'll leave you with 2 stars, but the service? 1 star at the very best. If you're going to serve Hispanic themed items on your menu, don't serve an attitude to your customers when they order & pronounce those items correctly.",

They have sandwiches, salads, and sides and veggie options too for you herbivores. On the back, they have a ton of drink options; I think more drink options than food haha  I got the BLAT - bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato sammich, and dill pickle chips as my side. So. Good. Portions were a good size for the price. There wasn't a lot on the menu for picky palates like the hubs, but if you have an open mind and like lots of different flavors, give this place a try!",

I didn't give them 5 stars because I would have liked to see 1 or 2 more options for food, but the food we did order tasted great. At one point Jacob looked at me and said \"wow I just found myself eating this as if I haven't had food in days\". He had the vegetable hash entree and added sausage, I had a side of the vegetable hash. I am not a coffee drinker I have never liked the taste but I did get the coconut cold latte they have on draft and it was very tasty. Jacob got a shot of espresso and their beer-mosa, he said both were delicious. I'm not sure if this will become a regular spot for us because we typically don't go out for a small meals very often but it was very good.   Also, the guy working behind the counter (I didn't catch his name) was very nice and really knew their product. Everyone that worked there had a friendly attitude which is always nice to see and sometimes hard to find in the service industry.",

The bartender/server was friendly. The ordering situation was not what I expected. You order and pay at the counter, then they bring the food to the table, which is fine. However, we ended up ordering more mimosa's, and they brought another bill. I would rather have paid at the end of the meal, but no big deal. The staff was attentive and service was solid. This place is in a bit of a hidden location but certainly worth the experience.",

    "text": "Well this was a pleasant delight on my Saturday morning food adventure this week! Roots just opened this week, so my coworker and I decided we wanted to try it out since it was in our neck of the woods!  They have a very limited menu, food wise, but I guess that's not a bad thing. They know what they're good at making and you don't have to waste time pondering over an extremely ridiculously large menu. My coworker went with the burrito. She said besides the plate being a little too compact (as it looked like the burrito was about to explode from the plate) it was good! Good flavor. The potatoes looked like they could have been cut up a bit more, but she didn't seem to have complaints. I went with the tortilla. I don't know that I've ever had a tortilla or knew exactly what it was, but I wasn't upset when it arrived! It was delicious, all of my favorite ingredients! It could've had a little more flavor, onion and peppers, but overall it was good and I would order it again (and recommend it). I also got a side of bacon... GET THE BACON!!! Perfectly crisp and delicious! The food was great and I was impressed for them being spot on, on opening weekend! Well done Roots.  Lots of drink options - cooler of cold beverages, coffee, lattes, hot tea, mimosas and more!  This is a cute little cafe that has a nice, cozy and intimate atmosphere. Like a said it's a small cafe so the seating is limited, but a nice mixture to choose from: regular tables, high top and a little bar (4 seats or so).    I'm not sure the pricing on their limited breakfast menu will keep this place afloat (it's a bit pricey), but I have a feeling their $5wine/$16bottle selections during the evening hours will keep the happy hour crowd pleased and coming back time and time again! Can't wait to come back and check out the evening/wine scene!",

Service was also terrible, we had to get a chair ourselves cause they didn't let us take one from another empty table.  So disappointed, upset and STILLL HUNGRY!",

My favorite lunch dish so far is the Bunless Veggie Burger salad and my favorite brunch are the breakfast tacos. I love that they have a different brunch special every weekend as well as $4 mimosas.

Needs a little more sweetness or flavoring.  Got here right after lunch started. Got the root veggie salad with a side of chicken and dumplings.   Salad was great. I'm a big fan of beets and butternut squash so this was a great hit. Could do with a little more goat cheese cause I also love that but highly recommended healthy filling noms.  The side of chicken and dumplings was a perfect addition. So hearty and filling and warm.   Have a few more things that look great so I will probably be back. Last of not least for the booch on tap!!!",

When you walk in the door, you are struck by the originality and character!  I met a friend for lunch.  The restaurant was quiet enough to have a great conversation.  Chicken and dumplings is what I ordered.  The menu had some great bowl options.  Being from the south, the chicken and dumplings weren't exactly what I had expected. It was more like a thick chicken noodle soup, but still very tasty.  My friend had a turkey wrap and a small bowl of the soup.  Very enjoyable, and not too much to feel bloated.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant does not have sweet and low for unsweetened tea.  This restaurant was out of all artificial sweeteners, which was a small disappointment.  Had it not been for that, this would have been a five star review.  Regardless, this is a Southend treasure and I hope they are here to stay for the long haul.  Charlotte needs more funk like this and fewer big chains, IMO.",

When I went it was a cold, rainy day and I decided to order the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was really good, thick and creamy. The grilled cheese was a little much - grilled cheese can be too cheesy.   The soup and sandwich was pretty expensive too. I think my meal was about $16. That seems steep for what it was.   I definitely want to go back there and try something else. It's super close and the interior is actually really sweet. There's something sweet about it. It get's high ratings for a reason and I want to find out why!",

    "text": "I visited Roots Cafe on a Tuesday evening with four other ladies for our monthly book club meeting.  We arrived around 5:30 pm and were one of two tables in the restaurant.  The bartender (owner? manager?) greeted us immediately and got us settled at a table with a large bottle of water to share.  He invited us to come up to the bar to order.  We went up for drinks first (of course!), and he was very helpful with selection and tastes before choosing the wines.  I love that there are several sub-$10/glass options.    We then re-visited the bar to place our food order.  We ordered 2 bunless veggie burgers, 1 chicken and dumplings, 1 brussels tartine and 1 veggie noodle bowl with chicken.  Overall, the table agreed that the flavors were good but the execution was lacking.  There were a number of things that could be improved: 1.  At the time of ordering, we were the only table in the restaurant.  But, delivery of the food from the first plate to the last plate was about 7-10 minutes apart ...plenty of time for the first plates to get cold if you are waiting for everyone to receive their food, which we were. 2.  The food didn't meet the description of the menu and/or the order placed.  The bunless veggie burgers didn't come with the cruncy sweet potato strips and the veggie noodle bowl was served without the chicken.  The latter was corrected by bringing out a separate saucer of sliced up chicken, but it took minutes - time where the broth and veggies were cooling.    3.  I know this place doesn't offer table service....but, since they have tables...maybe consider it.  We would have loved more wine, but no one wanted to interrupt the conversation to get up and order more.  No one checked to make sure the food was good or that we didn't need anything else once delivered.  Again, I know this is their model - but, if you are serving hot food to tables, maybe add one more person to serve the tables.  Overall, the flavors were good...but, I think Roots needs a bit more time to mature.",

Here's why:  I've been here a few times for lunch to eat in. Sandwiches I ordered were good, but nothing noteworthy enough to remember a few months later. Another time my fiance brought me soup from there when I was sick. I remember it being a little bland, but I was sick, so I could hardly judge.  Looking for a quick, healthy dinner last night around 7:45pm, we stopped in for take-out. We ordered at the counter, paid (around $20 for a sandwich with side and a hot veggie noodle bowl), and waited a about 10-15 minutes. When we got home and dug in, both of us were disappointed with the lack of flavor. My fiance didn't say much about his sandwich, but his side of roasted veggies were herbed nicely, but needed salt. My veggie noodle dish was in a curry sauce that was super watery and also had no flavor. I kept shaking salt on it and it was never enough.   For the price, I can't really say this place is worth it. The concept is great, the space is nice, and the food could be good, but this place isn't doing it for me.",

    "text": "Roots Cafe was a quaint little place for a Sunday morning brunch with a friend. They're bustled back in a shopping area but luckily I was able to find parking. The first thing I noticed was the cute outdoor seating area. It was a nice warm day and strongly considered taking a seat out there.  Once I arrived inside it was easy to navigate. There was a small line leading up to the bar and menus laying on the bar. I grabbed one and started searching for what I wanted to eat. I saw the French toast and didn't turn back. We ordered at the bar and were given a number to place on our table so we were able to seat ourselves. There were three tables available at the time so we didn't struggle for seating at all. Our mimosas were brought out within 5-10 minutes which were the perfect brunch sips. Our food was delivered about 10 minutes after that. Like I said I had the French toast and my friend had the breakfast tacos. The French toast had great flavor and was perfectly sweet. The toast itself was a little burnt but I didn't totally mind it. I also wasn't super impressed with the portion sizes, like I definitely could've ate more but maybe that's just my own problem. I had originally left my tab open so I could get another mimosa but without servers or anyone checking on us, it honestly didn't even cross my mind to go back to the bar and order another. We stayed for about an hour and the tables were flipping fast so we didn't feel rushed. Very cute brunch spot and cute atmosphere but I would be interested in trying some other spots next time I'm in the need of a brunch date.",

This location is within a neighborhood so I'm sure they get lots of foot traffic, which I'm sure is good for business.  They offer a limited menu that usually includes a breakfast burrito that sometimes changes pretty often.  The roots hash that they served on the truck is usually offered on the weekend, and is along with the breakfast burrito my favorites.  It doesn't matter which breakfast burrito they offer, it will be delicious, the only issue I had a few times was that when they decide to change it up and show the ingredients on the board they may forget an ingredient or two or give me something I didn't order.  Also, they go back and forth when I ask for egg whites, sometimes it's no problem other times they say it's not an option....fine no problem, just be consistent.  I have tried some of the breakfast specials as well and still no complaints with the food and the zucchini bread is good also, so for me 4 stars for the food less stars for consistency and service which was never an issue on the truck.",

It's very small on space with a bar area and tables of various sizes packed closely together. There are also about 2-3 tables outside in front of Roots.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you walk in and place your order at the counter. If dining in, you grab a number and plop it down on your table of choice. They pride themselves on serving locally-sourced ingredients so you can feel pretty good about anything you order.   With menu options such as Basic B, avocado toast, and various bowls, this place is the perfect spot for millennials. As a millennial myself, I enjoyed my bowl but I wish there was a bigger portion of sweet potato offered in the bowl. My former coworker ordered the bunless veggie burger and cleaned her plate.   After around 1:00, the place died down. We had a couple people check in on us for water refills and to take our plate but we never felt rushed as we ended up staying and chatting until after 2:00.  They serve various coffee drinks that I wouldn't be opposed to trying but I cannot see myself coming back as it's not in my regular 'hood and there are a ton of other places that I enjoy more for brunch/lunch.",

Today I mosied in for breakfast.  I ordered the Basic B which is two eggs over easy, two strips of bacon, and a white/sweet potato hash topped with a tomato jam.  It was cooked perfectly but arrived lukewarm which surprised me since I was the sole patron.  Tasty, however, and gone in a jiffy.  A couple things I didn't care about.  The tables appear set up for table service, but it's a walk up counter, and being unfamiliar with the menu, I felt rushed (the staff was friendly, I just wanted more time).  My coffee was refilled and the staff asked about the meal.  Nice.  Secondly, I dislike having to choose tip options when the payment screen is spun around.  I feel like an el cheapo if I don't throw something into the cup, but, damn you haven't done anything that's not obligatory.  If I lived in the neighborhood, Roots would be an easy walk over.  Would I drive outta my way?     Not really.  However, I still say \"give 'em a whirl.\"  Lets support locals cranking it out",

It was ok; nothing great. I was a little bummed that there was no protein. I also order a kombucha (which is pretty expensive, but it was on tap, so I was excited about that). Just to try to pour it and found out that it was tapped. Had to wait most of my meal for the new barrel to be ready. Overall I felt it was too expensive for what I got. That being said, the atmosphere is cute, and I like that they had outdoor seating. Would probably be a cute place to go for coffee.",

You have to allow a little more time for your food because the kitchen is small, but you are rewarded for your patience, with fresh, flavorful, unique dishes you can't find elsewhere in the city.  Stacy and Julie are the managers; the customer service is second to none.  Go once and you'll likely become a regular.  Roots also boasts the best lobster roll in the city, but it's an occasional special. It should be a regular on the menu!",

I wish it had a stronger espresso and vanilla taste because the milk ratio was more prevalent. For lunch, I ordered the Farmer's Market Salad with Salmon. The salmon needed a lot more seasoning, it got a little bland as you ate on. The salad was super fresh and there were peach slices in there which I loved. I wish they had put a little more dressing in there because the entire salad just started to taste bland after awhile with the salmon.   My friend had ordered a mimosa and I was pretty disappointed in the mimosa, it just wasn't that good. I wish they had breakfast and brunch items more often instead of just the weekend because it sounds and looks super good!",

The menu for breakfast was pretty simple but very filling. They also had a lot of coffee options. If you're looking for a nice place to grab a light bite to eat and a latte this is the spot for you.  I also asked for a side of toast and it was so big it might as well have been a loaf of bread! LOL I wasn't able to finish it but good to know you get your money's worth. The same way you'll get your money's worth if you go see Thor: Ragnarok. It's an excellent movie that really breaks the mold.

To my surprise they had a very limited menu. My friend didn't like her meal at all. My meal which was just a plain Jane bacon,egg,and cheese croissant i felt like it was just something i simply could have made at home. When you order your food you have to order when you first arrive and they give you a number and bring out to your table. No one ever came back and checked in on us asked if we were enjoying our food or anything. Unless they broaden their menu a little more i don't really see myself coming back here at all. The staff wasn't the friendliest either.",

I went to order the bunless black bean sweet potato quinoa burger because I had it the other day and it was amazing and I wanted it again. Fresh, filling, layers of flavor. It's the kind of thing you want to make for dinner at home but you probably won't. This evening I was warmly greeted by Jamie and Casey. They were holding the fort down at Roots. Jamie took my order and chatted with me while Casey whipped it up. The pickled peppers on the entree are my favorite and those guys threw in a little extra for me (I hope I don't get you in trouble guys!). My only complaint this evening was that they didn't have pumpkin cheese cake I was craving or a single glass of red wine to go. But I did get a side of cauliflower au gratin and what do you know but that white veggie covered in cheese satisfied both of those cravings in one fell swoop. Thanks, Roots! I'll see y'all soon.

The wine for this cafe has been carefully chosen and by just tasting 3 varieties I am hooked. I walked out with a bottle of yummy wine. I enjoyed their root hash for breakfast. It was well prepared and very tasty. Before serving the main dish, I was treated to a tiny quarter size biscuit with marmalade (which can be purchased at the cafe). Again the presentation was spot on! I can not wait to try their lunch and dinner menu. I will definitely be back for their Thursday wine tastings (which will change to Tuesday's in November).Root Cafe, you got everything right!  Cheers to you! Foodies, do not pass this cafe by!

    "text": "My wife and I stopped by for breakfast last Sunday morning.  I had a biscuit with a fried egg, bacon and cheese and a side of the roots hash and a cup of coffee.  The biscuit was pretty good... probably the star of the experience for us.  The hash was a combination of roasted root vegetables and was pretty tasty, but could have used a bit of salt (and we couldn't find salt available in the dining room).  $9 for a biscuit, however tasty, is pretty steep, though.  Maybe if the hash had been included, it would have been a fair price, but they hit you another $3 for the hash.  The coffee was well roasted, brewed and of a good quality, but I'd bet it was a Mexican single-origin... it was pretty one-note.    My wife had the lemon cream pizelles with a side of crispy bacon (we specifically asked for it crispy and the guy taking the order spent some time typing in notes (I assume), so the request made it back to the kitchen).  She liked the pizelles, but the bacon came out limp, so we sent it back... and it came out limp a second time.  Granted, they use a very European style of bacon  that is hard to get crispy... it's a lot more like ham than American bacon, but since they used the term 'crispy bacon' several places in the menu, I expected 'em to get it right the second time, at the least.  Again, the dish was overpriced for not having a side item included.  You can tell that they are putting a lot of energy into high-quality ingredients.  We also appreciated the euro-style water service, using old Champagne bottles and a chilled filler-tap.  It was OK, but we probably won't be back.",

Very cute decor with a small, quaint atmosphere. The food was delicious. I had the breakfast burrito that was loaded with sweet potatoes, Kale, egg and spices. It was pretty large so I saved half!  My latte was perfect. The hubs had the fried egg on a biscuit with ham. He also got a scone to go. It's waiting for us to dive in when we need a snack (hopefully not in traffic). Happy Thanksgiving weekend . We will be back here for sure!",

The only thing I would ask for different the next time is to toast the roll.  Heavy smoked aroma and flavor.  Atmosphere is small and inviting.  Order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Worth a visit!  I will come back for lunch and dinner!",

    "text": "This is one of those reviews I'm hesitant to give because I don't want anyone else to be in on the secret!   Roots Cafe is just lovely. It is one of our favorite spots for a weekend breakfast. The atmosphere is so calm and homey, the staff is always kind and friendly, and the menu offerings are tasty!   We usually order two entrees and then share. The menu seems to change often, I'm not sure if it's just because they are new and trying to figure out what works or they just like to keep things fresh. So far, our favorites have been: the roots hash, the Spanish style tortilla, the latkes and the breakfast burrito. We also had a biscuit sandwich once, that has since disappeared, but I wanted to shout out that biscuit, it was quality! The coffee drinks are well done and the every changing assortment of baked goods are always fresh.   I really recommend this for a low-key, high quality breakfast stop!",

The menu is farm to table, ridiculously fun mixtures of ingredients. I had the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado) on fresh brioche with a side of corn salad. It was fantastic! Full of light and fresh flavors. My business partner had the veggie burger with a side of the cucumber salad.... same reaction!  Great vibe and friendly staff!   Roots is officially on our rotation of local spots to enjoy!",
