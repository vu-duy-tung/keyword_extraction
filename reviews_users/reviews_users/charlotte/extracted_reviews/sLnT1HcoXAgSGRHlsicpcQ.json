It's fresh and flavorful and HEALTHY which is a huge plus. The orzo tabouli salad with salmon kabobs is my go to- but the gruben is a close second! Just look at the menu and try not to drool. On a no carb day you can do a protein plate with chicken, carmelized onions and their feta slaw (mm) or roasted veggies with chicken kabobs. They have a lemon vinaigrette that goes with everything. House made hummus... Kid friendly. Fast and fresh. I could go on for days. Definitely my favorite fast casual place in town!",

I ordered the chicken roll ups - its 2 flour tortillas filled with chicken, caramelized onions, feta cheese, and lettuce then rolled up and sliced in half so you get a total of 4 rollups. It also comes with a side- I got pasta salad. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie which is literally the size of my hand with 2 kinds of chocolate and it was great. The food took about 5 minutes to come out and they bring it to you. Overall I really liked the food and will definitely go again - I felt like I got plenty of food - I even got a to go box to take some home.",

The kebab came with rice and a greek salad and was brought to the table by their friendly staff.  Nothing wrong with the food but also not \"extraordinary\"... I thought the salad could have used more \"oomph\" (took me a while to figure out what that yellow/red stuff in the bottle in the middle of the table was ;-) and the chicken was a little bland.  I found the lime-aid to sweet for my taste.  Still, an OK place to maybe take the kids to for a quick lunch some time - at least it's healthy!",

Their pasta salad and braised beans are tasty sides, but their potato salad was a little bland. That being said it's the healthiest potato salad I've ever had, no mayo or eggs to be found.

My parents were visiting and we had ordered a family meal, to-go. Maybe we had waited too long to pick it up (we were also new to the area and I remember my husband getting lost on his way there) and it cooled a little too much. I was hesitant to give it another try after that; but a friend had suggested we go there for lunch since we were going to be nearby. I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken for me and the grilled chicken fingers for my son. I was absolutely hooked after that. I now crave that salad multiple times a week and have to stop myself from eating it everyday. My son,who is very picky about the proteins he eats, also ate all of his chicken. I've since been back about once a week, usually for the Greek Salad; however, I've tried the spinach  roll ups with chicken and the chicken kabobs. Everything is just delicious and the chicken is always flavorful and tender. I have also purchased their prepared chicken salad and their Greek dressing to have at home. Everything I've tried has been excellent. The staff is also incredibly friendly and very helpful. Whenever I go with my little one (which is on most occasions), they are always rolling a high chair to a table for me as soon as I finish ordering. I'm so happy I gave Zoes another try because I'm hooked! One yelper did mention that it gets crazy during the lunch hour and he wasn't kidding. We generally try to get there before noon or after 1:15ish.",

    "text": "This is a kinda Greek place that serves a nice selection of somewhat healthy foods. I wished they had actually called the dishes their real Greeks names (ie: gyros, souvlaki) but they have to appeal to Southerners who aren't always up for weird words. (gyros = yeee roes). Anyways, we had the hummus and salad plate which was very good. The chicken roll ups were nice and warm with a definite Greek flavor, the shrimp kebabs were entirely too spicy, though. My 11 year old loves spicy so he ordered these knowing it would be a little hot. They were scorching hot. I wish they would've noticed that a kid was ordering this and said something. The \"pick 2\" that my 16 year old got was less successful. He opted for the cookie side dish -other choices were salad, fruit, dessert or hummus which is a nice selection - but his sandwich was TINY and the cookie didn't round out the meal much by making it full-size. Go for a bigger side dish unless you aren't that hungry!  My one complaint was the pita. It's very good here, warm little triangular pieces served with the meal and with the hummus, but they don't give you enough! There was easily a half cup of hummus on my salad plate but only 4 triangles which was probably the size of a small pita or even half of a larger one. I asked for more when I went inside (we ate on the patio which was nice) and the girl there seemed baffled. They should be throwing this stuff around left and right because it is dirt cheap, calls out for hummus and a drink and really makes for a well-rounded looking meal. So, I said we had too much hummus left and needed more pita. She brought out...4 triangles. We actually laughed because these things are about the size of one Doritos chip. Oh, well. It was tasty, at least! The bill came to $35 for 2 meals,1 half sandwich and cookie and 1 hummus and salad plate. Not expensive but not cheap. Healthy and fresh and nicely different. Good for kids, too!",

It would be nice if they would smile and make you feel welcome but I would take common courtesy. Instead, we felt like we were a bother and heaven forbid we ask a question, because it was answered with shortness of attitude and a rushed feel. We were the only ones ordering but we were bothering the young lady who took our order.

The salad is huge and is delish, I had the Quinoa Salad, & i can not rave about this enough...  My Son got the steak kabob & it was cooked to perfection, His Girlfriend got the Greek chicken pita & loved it... We also got the Hummus trio which made our meals perfect...  Did I mention how wonderful the staff is? If so it bears repeating, never seen people who are happier to be serving others... Great place!!!",

I would recommend the Pita and hummus, the steak roll ups, the chicken, and the Zoes club. Also, with a family of 4+ you can't go wrong with the zoes family meals, for just 29.99 you can feed a family of four! Zoes will always be my family's go-to spot for healthy take home dinners!",

    "text": "I've drove past Zoes kitchen a gazillion times, and have never noticed it. How? I have no idea.  Thank goodness for my sister's friends' recommendation to try this little place out!   Zoes kitchen is a cute little restaurant where you order as soon as you walk in and they bring your food out to your seat - much like other places such as Noodles and Co. or McAlisters.  They have plenty of options to choose from.  I'm definitely not a Greek food junkie, as I usually run the other way when I hear 'GREEK FOOD', but I was very pleased with the taste and quality of my meal.  I had the Greek Chicken Pita with feta cheese left off and pasta salad as my side item.  The chicken was dry but from past experience, I just assume that Greek chicken is cooked that way.  The flavor was really light and tasty - perfect for brunch - but the portion was enough to make me extremely full.  The pita bread was on point. The pasta salad was delicious despite the fact that it had feta cheese all over it.  It almost made me regret keeping the feta off of my pita. All of this food for just 8$? I'd go back ANY day.   My only quibble is that there wasn't a ton of seating inside.  It was noon on a Saturday, so it was pretty busy.  We got lucky and found a seat right away but it was dirty until the waitress came and wiped it down for us.  If you don't want to be an unlucky customer with no table to sit down at, definitely try to go at a different time!   Otherwise, awesome food, awesome prices. Get the pasta salad. Don't leave off the feta cheese.",

I honestly can't believe that it's even possible to get someone's order wrong that many times. It's a shame because when my order is correct the food is excellent. Sigh... If someone from zoes kitchen sees this you need to sit down with your team and let them know that just because an order is to-go that doesn't mean don't pay attention or care about what you are doing. Unfortunately, I won't be back.   Sincerely,  -Person that drove 15 minutes to get an incorrect order (5 times)",

I don't think I have ever seen a restaurant in such disarray.  There were about 20 meals on the counter and they apparently didn't belong to anyone. Every customer in the restaurant was politely complaining about either the accuracy of their order or the quality of the preparation. Most customers were getting their money back. I had already paid for my meal online or I would have not stuck around for 30 minutes to get my take out order. In the end, I got 2 of the 3 meals we ordered although our chicken kabobs were cold because they had been sitting on the counter for so long. The person at the cash register who was giving me a refund got frustrated that it didn't work for him and left - presumably for good. The other person at the counter cheerfully refunded my money. Just before I left at 6:50 pm I heard the line cook say they were out of chicken!",

They are NOT NICE and frankly made me uncomfortable to ingest the food I bought. I watched the guy putting the soup I ordered into a container. That is until he ducked down and disappeared from view for about two minutes with my soup. Then after those two minutes he popped back up with my soup in his hand, stared at me intently, then handed it across the counter to the cashier. I was so creeped out by his actions that I did not take the soup and got my money back. I did not trust what he had to duck down to do for two minutes to my soup.

I'll just go ahead and add this to the top of my list of healthy restaurants to visit near my job!!! I loved this place! I ordered the Steak Kabob with Greek Side Salad and Vegetables and the Salmon Kabob with Greek Side Salad and Vegetables. I substituted the carbs since i'm on a diet. I ordered both to eat one for lunch and one for dinner. Thats how excited I was to try this place. Best decision I made that day! The Salmon was a bit Charred which I LOVED! Seasoned perfectly with onions. But the steak was the star. I'm not sure what sauce they use to marinade the steak but it was so good I poured the excess over my vegetables. The greek salad was nice and fresh. I wasn't that impressed with the dressing. It was a bit bland for me. But with a pinch of salt it shined! I can't wait to return to try the rollups and the shrimp kabob which seems to have really good reviews. After my favorite healthy alternative in Ballantyne recently closed, i'm so happy I found this Zoe's!",

For $12 I got the kabob, rice, salad and pita bread which I think is decent.  Would I pay that for a lunch meal, probably not, but it was a good look for post-workout dinner.   My heads up to you would be:  The kabobs are indeed grilled so be prepared for some char on the meat, veggie and skewer.  If you're not down for some char, this isn't the kabob place for you.",

    "text": "I love Zoe's! But don't try to go here in the middle of lunch hour. By 12:30 all the tables inside and out are filled and there's a line out the door.  But should you be one of those lucky ones who can go to lunch at 11:30 then it's a perfect place for lunch. The food is good, reasonably priced and fresh. There is low calorie fare as well as some items that have a little more than you would like but who cares it's your day off counting calories anyway.  The Steak roll-ups and chicken roll-ups are my favorite but having just tried the kabobs I think that's about to change.  One thing to remember is that if you have a smart phone, join the club, take a picture of every receipt you have from a meal there and they will e-mail you a coupon for something. Usually it's a soda or chips or a side salad, but the other day it was for 1 free entree . . . and that steak kabob was mine.",

He walked me through he menu and helped me decide by talking about what his favorite items were. He seemed dedicated to making ever customer feel welcomed and comfortable.  The food was amazing but the True reason I will be back is the exceptional customer service. Keep up the good work Billy and thanks for taking the time to make me feel welcome!!!",

Falafels were tiny, wrong shape and hard as rocks. Obviously, the recipe they use came from someone who never ate a falafel outside of Blakney. I have many friends who use their grandmother's recipe and have spent time along the Mediterranean Sea so I've had authentic falafels many, many, many times. These were so dense when I cut them with my knife they almost flew out of the bowl. Please take them off your menu as it's an insult to a real falafel. The worst texture, taste and ingredients I've ever tasted. Some one needs to teach your chef how to make a falafel. I'm available to train them. UGH! Horrible lunch and still churning with acid!  Never order the falafel bowl unless you like dog kibble for lunch!  ;-(",

    "text": "I like the concept for Zoes Kitchen. Basically it's healthy Mediterranean and Greek cuisine...FAST.   But I've got to agree with previous reviews, this place stays super busy. I visited on a Saturday afternoon (I know, I know...I should expect it to be busy) and this place practically had a line out the door when I walked in and still had one as I was leaving. So just prepare yourself...   But you can always use that extra waiting time to review the menu. You will need it, because the menu is massive. Which in the case is a good thing because they offered tons of choices including pitas, sandwiches, kabobs, and salads.  I decided to go with the Chicken Roll Ups with a Greek salad. After you order, they give you a number and bring out your food to your table. I appreciate that they keep the Greek dressing on the table. That way you can use as much (or little) as you like.   I was surprised that even though they were busy, it didn't take long for my food to arrive:  Chicken Rolls Ups: They come stuffed with chicken, caramelized onions, feta and a dipping sauce. I really enjoyed them. I added some of that yummy Greek Dressing and used the dipping sauce and they were delish either way. I just wish they included a little more feta cheese. But I'd definitely order them again.    Greek Salad: It comes with feta, olives, peppers, onions and tomatoes (none for me). They also throw in a side of pita bread. Classic flavors here folks. Really fresh and tasty, especially with their Greek dressing. Yum.   I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu items. I hear the kabobs, pasta salad (without mayo) and humus are divine!",

I placed my order and was told it would take 5 minutes, it took over 10 minuets for my take out order.....I was the only customer in the restaurant at the time.  The place needed to swept and cleaned up after the lunch crowd.  Not appealing to see food, bits of trash on the floor.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken with Braised White Beans and Falafel as my sides.  The chicken and beans were bland, NO taste or seasoning whatsoever.  The braised white beans use to be one of my favorite sides.  There was more water than beans in the side I received.  The falafel had a bit of a kick to it spice wise but not flavor beyond that.  Everything need salt desperately.  Needless to say, I won't be going back any time soon.",

I had originally thought about splurging for lunch next door at 131 Main, but because I needed to get back to the office, decided on getting a take-out from Zoe's instead.  I ordered the Tossed Greek Salad. First off, this thing is huge! Seriously enough for 2 meals... and calorie-wise, it's also 2 meals.  It is loaded with feta, black olives, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and lots of chicken. It also comes with pasta salad, carmelized onions, red onions, pepperoncini peppers, and a side of pita bread. They are happy to customize it though and will leave off anything that you do not want.    They were pretty busy & told me it would take 10 mins for my takeout to be ready but it was ready sooner than that so that made me happy.",
