    "text": "Why do I do this to myself.  I really want the food to be good.  So I gave Godavari one more try and guess what - big disappointment. I ordered 4 Naan and received 1.  Sorry guests no Naan for you. They must have a different chef as the food taste and quality has gone down the tube.  I have ordered Paneer Tikka Masala for the last year plus from here and never was there green peppers and onions in it - it was a flavorful sauce loaded with paneer.  Now if it tasted good then I say keep them however the green peppers and onions dominated the dish.  In my to go order I had about 10 pieces of paneer(I actually counted them) and the rest of it were inedible onions and green peppers. Then I ordered non spicy egg fried rice and chicken fried rice for my kids and it was so spicy they couldn't eat it.  Sorry kids no dinner for you.  Spend $80 and get food I literally threw in the garbage.  Personally I would have rather burned my money then pay for this horrible food plus the embarrassment as I had guests over and they had no Naan and their kids had no food to eat.  I really would like a refund, however you know how that goes sorry but we don't do that.  Would be great if the owner would reach out and offer that.  I would love this to be one of my regular places to eat however time and time again it is just getting worse. It is either the slowest service you have ever seen or poorly prepared food or both.",

My only complaint about the restaurant would be the execution of the service.  There seemed to be some confusion between the back and the front of the restaurant when it came to ordering food. However, this is a brand new restaurant that's only been open a week. I expect these problems will be eventually ironed out. However with that said, I thought the food was very good, and will definitely cause me to overlook any hiccups in their service.  I'll be back.",

Try the Dosa (an indian pancake), they are exceptional. The naan are also good and its nice to see goat as an option.  Their food is on the spicy side, so if you are unsure i would suggest mild. Its normally a warning sign to me to have the question of spice level, another reason to pick mild. IMO a particular dish generally has a particular spice level, but in this case its OK because the underlying food is good.  A few common curry dishes you may expect from any Indian restaurant are not here but the curries the do have are good.",

There was almost 20 minute wait for fresh batch of Indian Bread (Naan). Vegetarian items quality is not great. Paneer was rubbery. Sauce used in Paneer curry was sweet not to the taste buds. The Buffet didn't had good variety of vegetarian options. I wouldn't suggest vegetarians to go here for buffet. The price is on quite higher side for what they offer.

The owner came by and asked for feedback on the food. Seems like a very nice guy. We enjoyed the buffet so much that we brought both sets of parents there for Mother's Day brunch. They even had Mother's Day cake for dessert and made dosas to order.   Good service and fresh food!",

This is my second visit here and it will be my last. The first one was not that good so I'm not sure what possessed me to come back. Maybe because it is Christmas Eve and there are not many places open. My bad. We actually know of an Indian restaurant where the service is great and the food is better, but my family was hungry and it is further from home. What a mistake!  I wish I could give this place zero stars. Not happy.  40 minutes later - finally got the food (but still no apology) and brought it home. Surprise, surprise...it was good. Too bad my family had filled up on snacks during the LONG wait and were not really hungry.",

I really like Indian food, and have been to many places, including all of them in South Charlotte and I think this one is the best.  Service was impeccable.  Constant attention, everything was prompt and well presented.  We were there around 6 PM on a Tuesday and dining traffic was light.  There were a steady stream of takeout customers coming through though, and the place was busy.  The food was the highlight though.  We had three adults and three kids.  We had biryani, vindaloo, butter chicken, a lentil entree and naan.  Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  They made the biryani mild for the kids.  They brought some chutneys and raitha too which added additional flavor.  Portions were ample, we had some food to take home.    The only thing I can say negative is that the vindaloo should have been hotter.  I have only ever had it one way, super hot.  And it just wasn't here.  Looking forward to returning again soon.",

I waited over 30 min past the requested time for pick-up I selected at check-out to be told they didn't have my dish. None of the Tikka Masala dishes were available the Friday evening. The 10% just didn't seem worth the trouble and I plan to call in to make sure they have the ingredients for my food before I pay and wait for nothing.",

I will go into detail on the plates after another visit or so but it may take some convincing to get my spouse back any time soon...  The reason for 3 instead of 4 stars: Last week my wife stopped by after a long day of work for \"walk-in and order take out\" and had an unreasonable wait of one hour - she went shopping for 20 minutes, returned and then went home before returning. The person taking order on the tablet seemed unfamiliar with the system which may have contributed but not the only reason. Wife was offered 10% discount but she had already paid and did not want additional delay.  She observed all tables being waited on by the same overworked person that handled us on first visit and we had the impression she had no wait staff experience at all but I hope she succeeds.   I do want chime in to say that there needs to be better coordination between the front and the kitchen.  I have a feeling there is some great food here already, deserving better service, and hope the best for this restaurant.",

    "text": "We thought Godavari opened at five so we had some time to kill. Luckily there is a grocery store in the same strip so we spent some time getting a few things for the upcoming week. The menu listed Flying Horse and Taj Mahal for the larger beer choices but they were out of Flying Horse so I just had two Taj Mahal's. That's fine, they are both good beers. We ordered the Gobi Manchurian spicy and a garlic naan. The Manchurian could have been spicier and I would suggest a few sauces to go with the naan. Again both were still good. Of course I have to try the curry goat, as for me that's the standard by which I basically judge their take on the cuisine. I know I'm biased but it is what it is.  The wife had their veggie tika and I tried her sauce. Again, could have been spicier. I think some Indian places don't think white people can really handle what they consider spicy. God I miss Tamarind. I'd like to go back and try something else. They need to step it up a bit to compete with Chaupaati down the road. Not a bad choice though if you are in the area.",

They have a lot of other options as well like lamb. Rice was good as well. They also had masala chai. Staff was super nice and helpful with questions. Will come here more. $8 tues- thurs. closed Monday's. Weekends larger buffet :)",

The food was such a disaster and I felt sick after coming home. I did rate 1 as there is no negative rating available. Better choose a different place instead killing hunger eating the food that's not fresh",

    "text": "So, we were starving and still decided to try a new place out instead of our usual Indian hangouts.... I'm going to do a course by course live review...  Ordered sweet corn soup after we were told that they ran out of manchow (Sat night, 7.45pm).  When the order arrived 15 min later, I was in for a surprise. For the 1st time in my life, I saw sweet corn soup that was yellow in color. The taste was horrible. Seemed like mashed vegetables and hot water. Not a good start. Never ordering that again (that is if I come back here)...   Next comes the Vada and Chilly Chicken. The Vada is nothing to write home about. Ordinary. The chutneys were bad. Sambhar was watery.  Chilly Chicken is decent. Though the server tried to convince us that it was goat. It isn't. But Blue Taj still has the best Chilly Chicken or Prawn in the area.   It's 8.40. Still waiting for the entrees to arrive... oh wait, I think they're here...   Okay. The chicken curry, which was their specialty (some organic chicken stuff), was a disappointment. The chicken had no moisture and felt like chewing fibers. The gravy was okay. Felt like a bit too much red pepper was thrown in...   Goat pepper fry was plain bad. No juice in the meat. There was no taste. No flavor. I am a huge goat connoisseur and I am hurt...   Naan. Half cooked. Need I say more.   I regret my decision, specifically today. We could have had a sumptuous dinner at any of regular spots.   9pm. $69 after taxes and tip. Oh well.... we'll fry some samosas tonight while binge watching Netflix. Ciao!!!",

The 90.5 on my last attempt was the HIGHest of my visits; the other two attempts were in the 80s. I can understand and accept one bad score but to be consistently low is a sign of real problems. I know some don't really care about such things and will scoff at my emphasis on such things, but there are just too many other better options in south Charlotte that carry much lower risks of contracting salmonella.",

Last nights was our third try and it lacked the same consistency and flavor than the others and was more like a soup. It also lacked a substantial amount of potatoes but I may know where those went. I also ordered a chicken vindaloo which was a bit light on chicken but heavy on the potatoes (ah - found them!). While I do love potatoes in my curries I do also love the protein! Lastly, there was no rice!  Hopefully just a misstep for the evening as my previous meals there were fairly good.",

The Dal Mahkani was not the best, it was not too thick and not very spicy. The only thing truly negative was the fact that it took quite a while to get the food.
