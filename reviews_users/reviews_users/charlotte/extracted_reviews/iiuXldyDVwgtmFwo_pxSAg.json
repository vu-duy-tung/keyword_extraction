If you are in there for the buffet and you enjoy a variety of wings, this is your place.  If you want a high quality wing in great buffalo sauce with a variety of heats and fresh made Blue chesse, stay away.   What you will get is an over cooked, tiny wing that has very little meat on it.  Some people like that apparently.",

    "text": "Upon entering, this place takes the initial feel of a sports restaurant, with so much team paraphernalia draped throughout the place. They have a pretty big bar area with a good selection of brews & pretty good tv viewing. While the atmosphere inside invokes a large sports restaurant, the outdoor patio area is relatively small but you'll always be in the shade.  The wings aren't anything spectacular & I'm not sure how they won best wings in Charlotte by Creative Loafing. Nevertheless, they do have tons of sauce choices, but the prices are really unreasonable. If you aren't going there with a large group that all want wings, then expect to pay quite a bit per wing. For me, the wing quality just doesn't equal the price you pay. So the wings are better than average, but you can find plenty of places serving better ones for cheaper.  Other than the wings, the other menu items are actually pretty good too. From slider burgers, to wraps, you can usually find something you're in the mood for, & I really haven't had anything I wasn't happy with. But once again, I just think the prices are a little steep for the quality of food you're getting.   So overall, I'd say Wild Wings is a nice retreat to watch a game or grab a brew, but make sure you go with a beefy group to order the wings in bulk, or else expect a pricey tab at the end of the night.",

Great bread for dunking!  mile high ult nachos-5 great amout of toppings for chips. slider sampler-peeps, litttle b's and bbq pork slidesrs-4 2nd trip was during a big game day-Panther's in playoffs (sorry panthers) so the place was jam packed!!  We expected this.  We started a tab at the bar until a table was ready and had to stand.  okay by us.   Then got a table maybe 1.5 hours later.  Again ordered more stuff to share. flatbread pizza tomato basil-1-horrible excuse for pizza. Elios is better. dip sampler-spinch dip which first came out cold when we ordered it hot-3 buffalo chix dip-1 (be ashamed of your self Wild Wings for not knowing how to make a good  buffalo chix dip? Really) chile con queso-2-sucked but not as awful as the buff chix dip. Quesadilla-3   Good thing worked paid for the food however we still aquired 160.00 bar tab!   Stick with wings and nachos here.   And don't forget the drunken shrimp!",

Now the food........I ordered the 12 piece wings with a side of fries. I did half and half wings with the Red Hot Bleu and Island Jerk Flavors.  The red hot and blue wings were pretty good but the Island Jerk wings were disgusting and burnt to a crisp. They were just plain naked wings with some kind of spicy dipping sauce on the side. I was really disappointed with the wings but everything else seemed to be ok. I french fries were piping hot and the portion was huge. If I decide to return, I will not be having the Island Jerk wings again. They were just AWFUL!!!!",

It took us 5 minutes to be acknowledged, and another couple of minutes to get a drink. The bartender appeared to be hungover, high, or just didn't give a shit about his job. I honestly have never met anyone so apathetic about his job. I would have given him a break if he looked stressed or slammed - but he didn't. It took 25 minutes for us to get our wings- 5 minutes after the guy next to us got his wings (and he sat down 5 minutes after we did). Apparently our food was brought to the wrong table. That wasn't acknowledged until I asked where are food was. When we finally got our food, it was lukewarm. Not exactly how you want wings and fries. Never once did manager offer to help him, nor ask customers how everything was.  Having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, i was shocked he was a bartender. Usually that position was reserved for the higher caliber employees. It was something every sever strived for. This guy seemed better suited to be a bus boy.   A woman sat down next to us and I told her she would have better luck being in a waiter section.  Very disappointing experience made worse because of lackluster service.

    "text": "I only come here when friends want a run-of-the-mill wings and beer to watch a big game. The food isn't bad but it isn't great. The wings are fine but a little pricey, and if you've been to Wild Wing Cafe or Buffalo Wild Wings, then you know what to expect.  In my opinion, for good wings at a good price, just go a couple miles down the road to Wing King Cafe, a more \"local\" bar atmosphere.    However, I was pleasantly surprised by the individual television screens at some of the booths there. 3 of us shared a booth with screen which made it pretty convenient to watch the game and chat at the same time.   Servers were nice but nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "So first of all Wild Wing Cafe is hands down my favorite wing spot. I've frequented this location many times and have always had great food and service. I've moved further away from this area and I'm not able to get here often so when I found myself hungry and on this side of town I jumped at the opportunity.  FYI parking is usually a challenge here since the parking lot is small and shared with other businesses in the strip and I think they're pretty strict about towing for parking in marked spaces.  Anyway, we were greeted upon entry which was expected but the girl who took us to our booth made little eye contact, walked off with menus without indicated that we should follow her and just wasn't very personable.   We were seated in the bar area and literally sat there for over 20 minutes with no service. We were busy talking and looking at the menu so we didn't notice how long it had been. I kept trying to make eye contact with the barely busy bar staff to no avail. Finally in frustration I threw my hands up and at the same time a server from the other side of the restaurant came over to help. He apologized for the wait and informed us that it wasn't his section but he took our orders anyway. After he left our real server showed up. We told him we'd been helped already and he said \"ok\" and walked off!   I rated a 3 because our food was good and hot and though service was slow, our adopted server tried to be attentive. I probably should've complained to a manager but honestly I was just ready to leave. Like I said, usually it's cool here but it's been awhile. Hopefully tonight was just a fluke.",

We come in with a party of 5 starving and we don't get told that there isn't any butter until we start to order after our drinks even made it to the table. Being out of butter made it to where our entire table's order was ruined. This is the 2nd wild wing cafe i'v been to in the past 2 weeks that i've had an issue at, looks like I need to start going to Buffalo Wild Wings like I am right now. How about maybe next time you have a sign at your front door saying you are out of half your flavors or have the hostess let everyone know so they don't have to wait 15minutes for a table.",

However, this place has blown on all three occasions and all with the same problem. The service is awful. The wings are flavorful but the size of them are so small you'd have to eat large amounts just to be sated. But, the worst part is the sheer ignorance of the management and the bar tending staff. Order their not so special specialty drinks and you'll be blessed with a blah tasting overly sweet sorority girl concoction, but order anything else and just watch as the blank dum stare washes over their faces. I do give them one star because you can get a cold beer, sit at the bar and watch sports on TV. They also offer a all you can eat wing buffet for lunch, but at $12 that isn't cheap.",

When she came over to the table (after I asked the manager who our server was) she didn't introduce herself nor apologize for the wait. She said \"what do you want to drink?\" We gave our drink order. Then I told her we were ready to order. She rolled her eyes and stood with an attitude as we ordered. Took our food 47 minutes to come out. When it did arrive, it was warm and not even correct. We didn't ask for a replacement because she already had an attitude and we waited long enough.  My problem is this, if you're going to be a sever, you need to act like you like your job. I usually tip very well, but the service tonight sucked. I'm irritated because we came here instead of going to another wing place. We should've went with our original plan. Our drinks weren't even refilled.  I hope this place gets their act together from the luke warm food to the server with attitude.  I was able to get her name because it was in the receipt.",

Oh don't bother trying to call in a order for pickup it's faster to drive there and order they never answer phones. I've tried calling one night for over 15 minuets on my way home. You think I got anyone? At that point I was over it and it was too cold to get out and wait another 35 minutes to place an order.

I arrive 10 minutes later. Pay at the bar with the \"manager in training\" then I proceed to sit there for 40 minutes not being talked to or updated on anything. Finally the MIT says he is gonna check on my order now. Comes out and tells me they are \"waiting on the rice\" it was dead slow and rice doesn't take 40 minutes.

    "text": "I went here to catch Game 6 of the CHA-MIA first round playoff series.  I was not impressed.  Our server greeted us after we'd been sitting there for five solid minutes.  The first thing she asked was \"Do you know what you want?\"  We'd never been to Wild Wing Cafe so no, no we did not.  We ordered a couple of beers and the buffalo chicken dip appetizer while my wife decided what entree to get and I tried to decide which sauces to get with my wings.  We ordered our food.  I got the wing/boneless combo with China Syndrome and The Boss.  My wife got the Philly Hoagie.  About ten minutes later, our server came over with our appetizer.  She put it down and stood there, waiting for us to take a bite.  She said \"I can't just stick my finger in there to make sure it's hot, so I wanted to make sure it's warm enough.\"  What?  Really?  It's chicken dip.  Does she trust the line cooks that little that she doesn't think they can heat the chicken dip up properly, or had it been sitting in the window for so long that she wasn't sure if it was hot any more?  That question was answered when literally one minute later, a food runner came by with our entree dishes.  So we got to eat the chicken dip while our main courses rapidly cooled.  Oh, and the dip wasn't even really hot, but I let that slide.  The good: the boneless wings were large and juicy, and the China Syndrome sauce was pleasingly spicy.  The Boss on the regular wings was excellent, as well.  The bad: the wings are tiiiiiiiiny.  I don't think I've ever had such small wings at any establishment.  Also, I got 5 flats and 1 drumstick.  Per another Yelp review, apparently if you ask for all drumsticks there's no upcharge like at most other places, but I wasn't aware of that and didn't know any better.  My wife's hoagie was sufficient, if over-cheesed (with...American?  Ugh) and the steak fries were okay if a bit mushy.  Service was slow and barely adequate, but there were a bunch of TVs.  We left after the third quarter, if that tells you anything (not due to the fact the Hornets were losing).  Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "This is definitely a go-to spot for my husband and I and our friends to watch football in south Charlotte, especially the Panthers games. Tons of TVS and a great, fun crowd. The bartenders are nice and attentive, and they usually have great drink specials.   I've only eaten the food here a few times, and it wasn't out of this world delicious or extrao. I will say that if you are going to snack on their wings, try them in the honey sriracha sauce.  I recently went to Music BINGO on a Thursday night and it was so much fun! Such a neat concept, and the crowd was competitive to win. I've also been when there is live music, but sometimes it's so loud you can't talk to the person next to you (when in the bar area).   See you there!",

I will start off by saying that she took our order and we got our drinks and that's the last time she came over to check on us. I had to constantly look for her bc our drinks were out and she was upfront talking to her coworkers instead of near the back where she had 2 tables that she effectively ignored the entire time. Needless to say it was unpleasant. Hot wings with no drink and a waitress who was not concerned at all with her customers. Service terrible...food was great though.",

    "text": "I used to love this location. I have visited many times, frequented during my lunch hour (as I live and work in the area) and always had fairly good service. It took a lot of convincing to get my fiance to agree to go with me as he had a bad food experience from another location (it made him sick). I FINALLY get him to go with me and we decide to sit outside as it was such a nice day out. After about 15 minutes of sitting out there, a hostess finally came out to talk to us. Not realizing she was a hostess, I asked if we could place our order as we had been sitting there for a while. She took our order (by memory) and explained that our actual server (Jackie I believe) was in the weeds. I apologized and said we can wait, she said no big deal she will get everything going. Just to point out, I watched her do this with the other table who came out on the patio, there had been another table, but they got up and left after waiting about 15 minutes with no greeting.    I will give credit where credit is due, and our food came out timely, although I watched our appetizer be taken to another table and put down in front of the guests only for them to say, um this is not ours (again it was not our actual server and or the wonderful hostess bringing the food out). Our meals were then brought to us by a man who we both believed was just another server and or host. He did ask us how things were, but since we thought he was just another server/host we just said fine. Our actual server checked in on us twice and the second time we asked for our check since things had been taking so long we figured asking for our check at that moment might get it out to us by the time we were done eating. We thought wrong.   After another 20 minutes, finally I became impatient. I went into the bar and asked for a manager, the man who had brought out our food stated he was a manager (news to me as he never advised us of this before). I told him that the service had been very slow and we had been waiting for our check for quite a while. He explained to me that our server was behind and I explained that I did not care just please get me the check as we have things to do. He advised he would take care of our check to which I stated, no there is no need, we just would like to pay and leave. He then stated that if I had an issue, I should have let him know from the beginning. I was in shock that he said this, but I just said \"Ok, please get me my check\" and walked back out to my table.    I told my fiance what happened and he said \"He talked to you like that?\" I said, \"yes, it really caught me off guard.\" My fiance stood up to go in and have words with the manager as he did not like he was basically talking down to me. The manager had already started to come out to the patio when my fiance asked why he would rudely talk to me. This is where I became completely baffled. The manager actually started arguing with us, stating that if we had a problem we should have let him know. I explained to him, he doesn't have a pin or anything that shows he was the manager so we didn't know. He then stated very sarcastically \"well I'm sooooo sorry I don't have a pin that says I'm a maaaanaaaageeeerrr\" I looked at him like he was nuts as I have never been treated this way, especially by a manager. I explained to him that both my fiance and I had been servers and we know how things work and if someone is this behind, you find a different server to help them out. He basically blew me off, which again upset my fiance. At this point my fiance did drop a curse word and asked the other table how their service was (to which I explained to him was not the best idea, however he was beyond livid at this point). The argument was becoming heated and I finally stopped the manager (who again I couldn't believe was arguing like this, we simply just wanted him to not give us excuses and say I'm sorry but he argued and talked down to us which is completely unacceptable). I asked if we could simply pay and leave as this was crazy, and he said \"I'll just take care of your whole meal!\" Now mind you, he said this very rudely and loudly almost like we were just there in attempts to GET a free meal, which was not the case, we pay for our meals every time and we tip very well having been servers before.... we just wanted to leave as we had spent far too long there, had things to do, and were now being yelled at by the manager for reasons that were not our fault but the restaurant's itself.    We walked out and just felt so frustrated and embarrassed. It was like we were watching an episode of Kitchen Nightmares where the manager argues with the customer that they are wrong which in every episode that happens, it is pointed out that kills the restaurant.",

It reminded me of a Buffalo Wild Wings knock off but luckily I love BW3's so that's a good thing. It was quieter than I expected when I went on a Saturday night (especially quiet for a football night) but again, thats a good thing. Efficient service which was appreciated seeing we were going to catch a movie right afterwards. I found at these types of places you sometimes have to flag your server down which definitely wasn't the case here. There was a decent crowd but you could definitely carry on a conversation, watch a variety of games and enjoy the food. Speaking of which, I was pleased with the wings --I got the Gold Rush flavor which is a semi hot honey bbq and the sauce was tasty and the wings weren't all fatty how some other places are.  All in all, a good place to get some grub, have some cold ones and watch some ball. From reading the other reviews, I need to hit this place up on the Buy 12, get 12 wing night!",

The 1st trip was a friend/coworker,  a 3rd party coworker, a friend from the area who joined us later, and me.  We shared drunken shrimp, chipotle jolt and thai wings, sliders, and an order of nachos. The food was great, the wings was spicy and flavorful. The sauce in the drunken shrimp was a beer marinade that you could almost drink straight it was so good.  I had several cherry limeade vodka drinks.  On our 2nd trip, my friend and I returned the day of the Panthers playoff game. We literally spent the entire day/night there, it was so much fun.  Our food was disappointing this time however.  We had a dip sampler and the only good dip was the hot spinach dip.  The waitress brought us the cold one first, but then corrected the order.  The queso was mediocre and the buffalo chicken dip was just gross.  We also ordered a tomato basil flatbread that was terrible.  We had an amazing one at BlackFinn a few days before so we were disappointed by this one which was simply some cheese slapped on a tortilla. However, we relocated from the table to the bar, enjoyed the atmosphere and our many, many drinks, and had a really good time despite the disappointing food that day.",

The waitress made up some BS excuse that they had a new chicken guy in the back, but somehow everyone else who showed up after me got their food, including wings. I had to pay for my drink, and you would think that they would comp me at least for that. Never going back, never ordering from there, and going to spread the word.",

I was seated in a booth next to the bar and all you smell is stale, soured, old beer like they haven't cleaned the lines and bar top well.

A few minutes later, another came in our direction. We hadn't even got our food, which took a long time considering we were at lunch and we had to go back to work, when a third cockroach crawled under our table!   Unfortunately for me, I pushed back from the table and fell backwards in my chair! My manager called the store manager and told her what happened! Not once did she come over and ask me was I okay! Nothing! As a result, I'm out of work today with a mild concussion and back/hip pain!   I will never eat at a Wild Wing Cafe again and I will tell my friends and family not to eat there also! Thank you for caring about the patrons of your establishment!",

The food is always tasty and fresh which should happen at every eatery. I disappointed in my salad because it was tiny and came with the wrong dressing. I was given wing sauce instead of dressing. When I pointed it out politely the server told me I was wrong.  The service is slooooow. Extremely slow at every Wild Wing Cafe. I have been to several wild Wing Cafes in and outside of Charlotte. The are all slow. The workers always lack energy and enthusiasm.  The waitress today whom I will not blast by name was slow to serve us, bring water, bring drinks, bring food, napkins, etc. She asked if we wanted another thing when we responded she took her sweet time. She actually served other people before meeting our request which she solicited from us. I cld go on but taking my card with the bill stopping to take someone else's order with my card in your hand is ridiculous. I know what u r thinking: \"the restaurant was crowded\" but NO it was not. There were less than ten tables taken. She only had 2 then the one she took my debit card to.  Finally the parking lot was tiny. The majority of the parking belonged to other businesses. I will not return again.",

Completely inaccurate in an effort to speed the process I tried to call and now no one is answering. I give it a few minutes call again they pick up and hang up. I was upset and requested a full refund.   The service every time I have dined in or out is slack and pure sorry and lazy. At some point and time you have to take accountability and make the right wrong with customer service recovery and employee training. The manager on sight refunded us however I would advise to not be a patron until some re training is done with the staff.",

I wanted a small dinner so I opted for soup and fried mushrooms.  (Yummy yummy mushrooms remind me of a hard-to-find \"down here\" but \"back home\" food.)  I asked to have my soup brought out first, as did my dining companion.  It took a while for the soup to come out and not even a minute later, the rest of the food came out.  I was disappointed with the timing.  When the server came back with my payment, she didn't leave a pen.  I couldn't flag her down for one so I went to the bar to get one and left her a small tip, only because I'm not \"that\" mean.  The pen at the bar didn't work so I tossed it back down and the bartender said in a pi**y tone, \"You didn't have to throw it!\"  (I didn't, but I admit I was frustrated and could have acted better.)  Also, I hate places that let their front of house staff smoke while on break.  Our server smelled of smoke and it made me want to gag.",

    "text": "So I have been here probably 8-10 times. I come to North Carolina several times a year for work and my hotel is walking distance from here. So depending on the time of the day I arrive and what I'm in the mood for, I tend to come here from time to time. Been visiting this area for the last 6 years. In my many visits here I've had some great experiences and I've had some bad experiences. One particular I had to wait 30 mins to get a table. I ordered my food and more then an hour later I had to ask the waitress when my food was coming out, only to have her tell me she \"forgot to put my order in\". Then when I did get my order (Wings) the sauces were not what I ordered. That was bad, but another night I came was great. Food was fast and perfect, I got to watch hockey and chit chat with some locals, that was really good. But I'm reviewing on my average experiences and tonight specifically. I arrived at 9:25pm, the place was not busy. But when I went to check in, the two girls at the reception booth just kind of chit chatted and didn't acknowledge me for 3-5 mins. Kind of rude, finally I was asked my party size and seated in the corner pretty quick. My waitress introduced herself and asked what I wanted to drink. I had to request a beer menu as one was not included in their regular menu. 2 mins later she brought the drink menu. I looked through it and made my choice. She came back in 4-5 mins. I made my choice and asked if I could sample a beer on their menu. About 5 mins went by, a different waitress brings me my beer and says she is taking over as my waitress. Uuuuuuh ok, so no sample huh? Anyway they ask me for my food order and I give it. I time when she left from when I ordered. 11mins and 43 seconds later my food is brought out. Actually pretty fast, I ordered wings and tater tots. On this particular visit I got the OL' Smokey and Old Yeller sauces and these were two of the best I've had. So I had to put them in my review so I'd remember. One of the wings were on top of each other and the combined flavor was fantastic. The tater tots were cooked perfect, crispy but not burnt. The wings were hot temp wise and sauces were great. If I was rating solely on this visit I may have given it 4 stars. But as I said, I've had a couple poor experiences here. So I can't go that high on average. Also they really need to follow Buffalo Wild Wings and hand our wet naps with wings. It's better for guests and more sanitary. I don't like licking my fingers and touching a glass I'm not confident is 100% clean. Just my opinion. Obviously I'll come back out of convenience  and overall experience on visits. But, it could be so much better.",

We started with the burger sliders. my boyfriend demolished them before I could take a picture. He said they were good. Then we ordered a platter of 30 wings. They sauce them in increments of 6 not 5 (weird right) anywho. and order my favorite Steel town spuds! Everything was delicious. I also ordered a margarita of course.

I should preface this by saying that I worked for this company for 5 years, was a headwait server, etc  I couldn't locate if they still had flaming parm on the menu (my favorite for a buffarella) And our server tried to sell me a Kolsch beer. No harm, no foul there. He was young and clearly not properly trained. Our biggest concern, and why we left and ate elsewhere was our appetizer.  We ordered buffalo shrimp fried, and it came to our table while we had no plates, silver ware or napkins. I can be cool with that. What I cannot accept is the fact numerous bugs were crawling all over the celery sat in front of us.  We asked to speak to a manager because we did want to tip the server, and she didn't seem alarmed at all.  Sidenote, I sat and watched the table behind us go uncleaned for over 30 minutes, while nemerous employees were working. That's just laziness, and reflects on management.  I will give 2 stars for our server, but zero for this location. We left and at at Buffalo Wild down the street.",

    "text": "So we go to Wild Wing Cafe somewhat regularly to take advantage of the BOGO Tuesday night wing deal.  I really like their wings and at that price it's a deal I can't pass up.  We had seen the service decline over our past few visits.  Service was slow, mistakes on the orders.  Nothing major, but enough that it gave us pause when on Tuesdaywe would say \"Let's get wings!\"  Our last visit however was exceptional!  Service was really good.  Salads arrived with our wings, but I can deal with Wings and salad together. (A little more pacing would have been preferred)  As for the wings, as far as I'm concerned they are as good if not better than any other place around.  The key here is the flavors.  It's not just hot wings but many variations of seasonings to make for a flavorful affair.  My favorite is not on the menu so you have to ask for it.  But it's Boss-chilada.  This is a Boss dry rub wing finished off with the Ranchilada sauce.  So freaking good!  Ask for it by name! (There is a \"secret\" button on their register for it)  So please keep it up.  With good service like we had last night you make it very easy to want to come back.",

Meaty and hot and very delicious. The blue cheese was thick and delicious. The take-out was less than ideal with sauces that were much spicier than before and the wings were two bites and done.  Definitely not as meaty. They were definitely packed well though the blue cheese was thinner.  So it's hit or miss.  The restaurant is solid wall-to-wall televisions for sports. There is also a small stage area where they occasionally have live music. I haven't tried the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet.  [Review 11476 overall, 1255 of 2019.]",

The other star is for the slow service that was provided to another patron that ordered wings. Why does this matter, well fallow me down this slow, sad old town road.  Well, I was there with another patron and they asked one of the bartenders to place a order for wings (abt 12:30AM) and was told No. The kitchen is closed for tonight and accepting no more orders. Cool, kinda weird considering the place is pack and still a while before closing. Remember that slow service I spoke of earlier. Well that was a order of wings that was brought out AFTER our \"Kitchen is Closed\" conversation. Oh, he placed that order over an hour ago. .  Only 15 minutes later another order of wings and nachos was brought out for two women at the bar that seemed pretty chipper with the bartenders.   TTFN",

    "text": "5/5/19 I've never had great service here; but after six months or so, we go back and try again as my SO loves wings. When we came in, the restaurant was about 1/3 full, but the hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait (and she seemed annoyed to have to bother - not friendly). We sat and waited, while she and worker friends came up to socialize. There were MANY places to sit and no one seemed to be on fire for anything. The only ppl we saw act like they were on the job while we were there was a young guy (server)with brown hair, the bus boy and the bartenders.   When we finally got seated, we sat a while before we had to flag down to ask someone to send our server, etc. Finally a waitress with crazy faux eyelashes came over to us - she knew no specials or anything else, said she'd just gotten there, so we ordered an app and she went to find out drink specials and was gone a full 15 minutes; we had to ask someone for water, etc.  She finally came back with a  dirty clipboard with filthy drink menus and paper beer list - gross. She had to check on everything we asked about (it's a chain bar, wtf?) and would be gone for inordinate amounts of time - we really got waited on by bus boys and other servers we flagged down; she was beyond unprepared. We sat and sat as left us hanging - She appeared very high. Idc if she was high but it sure made for a ridiculous experience for customers and if she's that lax about everything we saw, how clean is she and others handling food?  Someone else brought out spud app, dropped it off, we still had no drinks, no silverware, no plates, and no one cared. We finally flagged down a busboy for silverware and plates.  Our waitress did recommend the Watermelon Margarita, said it was her favorite but said to get it with sugar (no). It was a great drink (without sugar rim) so kudos to her for that recommendation.   No one else seemed to be going around looking at customers or checking anything. Whoever runs front end of this place should be SO fired. Absolutely painfully obvious that no one gives a crap what's going on; not even mediocre front end.",

I love the taste of the slayer but I wish it was a little hotter. Service was great. She kept the beers coming. Had a coupon for a free appetizer so we tried out an order of their new nachos on chips. Great meal and I will continue to come back on Tuesdays.   Tonight was 2fer Tuesday again. Buy 6 wings get 6 free or buy 12 get 12 free. Super disappointed with the wings. They had no meat. It was a sad sad day at wild wing cafe considering they are supposed to be known for their wings. The chipotle jolt sauce was delicious although not spicy enough.  The server was very nice however, I had to go find another server to ask for plates since we had been served food with no plates. Aye.  I wish I could say it was a great experience but it wasn't. It will be a while until I go back after tonight's disappointing wings and service.",

    "text": "I had hoped that our visit yesterday would be an improvement on the last.  It was not.  (Also, let me just note, the manager wrote on my last review that I was to PM her my information and that she would contact me.  I did; she did not.)  We arrived last night to find that my parents had already been seated (a good sign, I thought).  Our waitress took our drink orders, and we started perusing the menu as usual.  Several minutes later our drinks arrived, and I ordered a basked of fried mushrooms (generally something I enjoy here).    About 10 minutes later the mushrooms arrived via a runner... they were not as they usually are.  Usually the mushrooms are lightly breaded and fried.. these were so breaded that we were pulling chunks of breading off to find the mushrooms.  Following that delivery, we saw nothing of our waitress for 20-30 minutes... I was a little concerned/annoyed by this, so I finally went to the host's stand to ask if he'd send her back when he saw her... his response?  \"Oh, she just got a 30 top seated, she'll be back in a moment.\"  ... ... you have ONE waitress serving a 30 top and ignoring a seated table?  Ok... fine.  I get back to my seat and she arrives about 5 minutes later to take our order for wings.  We all are huge fans of the Boss dry rub flavor.  My husband begins his order with 18 bone-in Boss style wings... our waitress cuts him off with: \"Oh, we can't do Boss right now.  They take too long.\"  **blink, blink**  My inner monologue is going bananas... Since WHEN!?  It's literally one of the most popular flavors!!  But we ordered various other flavors and moved on.  My father in law then ordered a Philly cheese-steak with house chips and was informed that they were \"having some issues making the house chips\" but she'd see what she could do... Ok, people... if items on your menu (simple, popular items) are going to be unavailable, you lead with that... you don't tell us as we're ordering after already having waited an unreasonable amount of time...  Finally our food arrived.  These wings were not the wings we used to see here... I wish I had taken a picture next to something for scale... they were pitifully small.  At this point, we ate our food, enjoyed conversation, paid our bill, and left.  I used a gift card for part of it, and thank goodness I could get rid of that.  I do not plan on coming back here.  It's sad... we really enjoyed family dinners here when they had their act together, but between the decline in customer service and serious lowering of food quality standards, we will not be back.    In short:  If you're coming here to belly up to the bar for a pint and to watch a game, I'm sure this is the perfect place, but if you're coming for the wings, go elsewhere!  There are plenty in Charlotte (and surrounding areas) to choose from!",

The waiter admitted he hates working here, but that it paid a lot better than other places around town, so it's \"worth the headaches to be able to pay bills\".   The serving sizes are small but expensive so prepare to either leave with an empty stomach or an empty wallet. The wait staff couldn't put together two tables for a six person party that came in after me.",

When we got our food back to the house, my husband noticed that his chicken was really undercooked. My salad was fine, but a lot spicier than I anticipated. When I called to tell management about our sandwich, a person named Caleb took my message and assured me that someone would return my call. So far, no one has returned my call. Furthermore, Caleb seemed unconcerned about my complaint and made no attempt to correct the issue.  I would've enjoyed spending time at the restaurant, given that they had EVERY NFL game on and a huge variety of fans too. The drink and wings specials seemed good too. But the wait for our food and the undercooked chicken has made this a no-go for us.",

However, if you are in a hurry or starving do not come here because they take forever to serve your food. Honestly my stars are only towards the food and the price. I have been here so many times and when the service is not horrible it is just okay, but those damn wings keep making me wanna come back! On Tuesdays they have 2 for Tuesdays which means whatever order of wings you choose you will get double for the same price! Like buy one get one free.  My husband and I both chose 6 wings and ended with 12. I had honey mustard and garlic, garlic, garlic. My husband had honey, lime cilantro and some spicy Parmesan flavor.  Of course we both loved our meal, but as mentioned before it took forever for the food to come.  I will be back here for sure, but only for the wings :)",

I've never been to this location but not a fan of the university location at all and the uptown location is cool but haven't been in a long while.  Upon entering we were seated immediately as it wasn't too packed. Our server Alecia came right over greeted us and asked did we want waters as we looked at the menus. She was great and checked on us often. My friend ordered the Carolina BBQ nuggets that come out pretty quickly and she enjoyed them. I ordered the watermelon margarita which was pretty good and I could taste the tequila. I also ordered the super snack sampler which took forever to come out. Our server literally came by the table 4 times to let me know that she was checking on it and it would be out soon. When it finally did come out the queso was cold and runny and the mozzarella sticks were lukewarm. The pretzel bites were hot and buttery, I enjoyed them. The Hot Shot sausage bites I didn't like and it came with honey mustard which I don't eat but she said I couldn't even just change a sauce it's not like I was trying to substitute one of the actual food items. So I didn't eat the Hot Shots at all. She told the queso back to get it remade and it come back super fast, this time it was thick and hot, only problem was it didn't have any flavor so I didn't eat that either. I was was stuck between a 2 or 3 since I could give a 2.5 but I have no desire to go go back.",

I would understand the wait if the restaurant was busy, but we were one of only 4 tables, with most of the patrons being at the bar drinking.   We asked about our order and someone said they would check, but never came back with and answer or our food. The server who took the order walked by and pointed at us as she looked like she forgot to ever place the order.   We left after the restaurant started to fill up with more customers and were told not to worry about paying for our drinks (sweet tea and a water)-probably because those were never entered either.

We shared the twelve wings and a basket of fries and I got a beer.  Fairly quick service.  Wings as expected if you have visited a Wild Wing before.  After the wedding we returned to the restaurant for drinks prior to going back to hotel which was close by.  It wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be with the first round of the nba playoffs starting but that was just perfect for us.  Decent crowd size but it allowed us to sit at the bar and have conversation without yelling over people. Good customer service as well",

Wings messed up, wrong order, waiting too long, terrible service, wing sauce tasted different every time.... and every time we have been there is always new people. The turn over at this place is horrendous.  Not sure it wasn't like this 5-8 years ago, it was AWESOME! The only reason I go now is to get their Jalapeno Cheddar wings.... but even that is hit or miss, the last time I went they were missing an ingredient that made the sauce taste odd.  Me and some friends went on a Sunday and they were empty and the staff told us it would be 50min wait, because they didn't have any help... we just laughed and went down the street to Wing King.  Hard to recommend this place anymore... :/ it's the end of a wing legacy, really sad.",

However, that's when you control the door and go on a wait to not weed your kitchen.   We ordered 2 kids meals as soon as we sat down and those took 45 minutes. We then ordered 12 wings and an appetizer platter, those took about an hour. We ended up having to ask for to go boxes to take our food to the hotel as we were not planning on a 2 hour venture.  I've been in the business a long time, specifically with a notable wing place so I know the business. This place needs to better equip their kitchen to handle rushes and control the door on nights like tonight.   Luckily our server was good which is what the 1 star is for. Poor guy probably lost some money in tips due to the kitchen & management.",

FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now\"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.           I called their Corp office and spoke with \"David\" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..          So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA",

Our hotel was near the airport so they recommended Wild Wing as a decent sports bar.  So off we went on a 20 minutes drive to eat and watch the game.    Yes, it is a sports bar.  Yes, it has multiple monitors.  That satisfied our baseball viewing requirement.  How was the ambiance?  It was a sports bar. It was COLD.  It was fairly loud, but didn't feel intimate in the least.  The high ceilings and decor probably doesn't help in that area.    The food?   Just okay.  Wings were so-so.  Onion rings were kind of gross (actually it was the puddle of grease under them in the plastic bowl they came in).  We got a heaping pile of BBQ chicken nachos that was kind of disgusting too.  I got a bowl of the white chicken chili that was decent.    You know when you go out to eat and you can't help but devour food that you know is mediocre and really bad for you?  This was the situation.  My colleague and I both agreed we had just eaten some really bad food.       I am adding a star because when Hideki Matsui hit a home run, the whole bar broke out in a cheer....so for the fact that there were Yankee fans there, I have to upgrade my review.      My advice if you need to go here?  Get a designated driver and then drink so much you won't taste the food.  Make sure your health insurance is paid up....",

On a Friday night I went out with my friends and I got a call from my boyfriend saying as they were seated the 17 year old hostess  slipped his 25 brother her phone number, they laughed that off and ordered dinner. Then the waitress began to sit down at their table( very inappropriate) and tell them about her personal life, her boyfriend and hinted they were not faithful to each other, no to mention she served them each 6 + beers getting them both drunk. I understand if someone orders it you serve it but really you should know not to over pour two people there by themselves because then how will they get home. I was asked by my boyfriend to come get him when my friend and I arrived it was very loud because they had a live band which was probably the only reason I'm giving the one star. We sat down and according to the boys the waitress was no longer her over friendly self like she was before. Shocking, we stayed about 15 minutes and when I went in the bathroom all three stalls were filled with girls puking their brains out, crying, screaming, and one laying on the floor. I decided to hold it as I crawled over the drunk girl on the floor, proving this was really a class joint. I know a bar cant really stop people from getting drunk but be responsible enough to tell someone no if they reek of vomit and cant stand up straight. I recommend to all the ladies in Steele Creek don't send your husbands or boyfriends to the Wild wing if you don't want them getting hit on by the staff. There is a time and place for flirting but work is not the place, I'm all for getting a good tip but being forward is highly unattractive and makes people not want to come back. Hope management reads this so the can do some house cleaning but I won't know because like I said we will not be back.",

So I waited and watched as tables were empty and never really cleaned off....or were cleaned off and no one was sat at them. Finally sat down after 8:30.... I went last night on a Tuesday for their wing special...I've been to this location several times on a Tuesday night and was able to order 10 wings and get 10 free, and get different flavors. Disappointed to be told that all wings have to be ONE flavor....pretty boring to only get 20 wings of the same flavor, especially since they've done differently before.  Still waiting at 9:15....server walked by several times but didn't say anything or apologize for the wait. I have never waited that long at this location, and it was pretty ridiculous to wait this long without anything being said.  Slow cleaning and seating + long wait for food + no apology or courtesy to let me know it's going to be a while from a server or management = me not ever returning to this location. This isn't the only place in Charlotte to get wings.",

One night, they weren't seating people (large crowd waiting) even though tables and booths were available.  We were told they were giving the servers a break!  We've also experienced some nights of extremely slow service, but other nights were great as some of the staff got to know us and took good care of us.  Unfortunately, turn over seems to be very high.  Last night, we went and were told we couldn't order all flats or all drums on Tuesday nights any more.  We were always able to do that, subject to an upcharge.  They'll still do it other nights, but not on Tuesdays.  Doesn't make sense to me.  its your restaurant and you can choose your policies.  I've had enough and will choose to eat elsewhere.",

All in all, I won't go if I can help it, and waiting to pickup food for my friends if I don't think to order ahead of time is grating. I won't eat in if I can avoid it. Don't order the flatbread--it's gross and sad.  Going in for bingo night is alright, but not worth it for me.",

The waiter actually brought more seasoning out to the table....really!!!??  And what happened to the size? I don't eat large wings, I like them normal medium size. I did not enjoy it at all, spoke to the manager who confirmed they used a different vendor for the chicken and thats why they were larger....the guy at the next table chimed in and said yeah...I noticed that too!

    "text": "Second time eating here, both times were positive.  I go here for wings and have had wings at most places in Charlotte.  I would rate these as some of the better overall wings in town.  They are bigger than Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings product.  The sauce selection is nice.   I got the medium hot and Pad Thai last time.  Didn't like the Thai, tasted like peanut sauce and not much else.  I was hoping for more of a spicy hot and sour flavor like BWW's Spicy Thai but whatever.  The medium were good but not buttery enough for a buffalo sauce.  Tonight I had the Spicy Parmesan and Lime Sriracha.  The Parm are awesome, very tasty and juicy.  My fav so far.  The Sriracha weren't that great.  The deep fried mushroom appetizer was actually really good, best I've had in awhile.  The batter was on point.    Service was good, the girl was friendly and attentive however we were at the booth right next to the server station so that may have helped.  Service the first visit was also good, very friendly guy.  I didn't notice any long wait times like other reviews mentioned but we were there at slower times.  The parking here does suck but you can find a few extra spots near the gas station up the hill.  This place is very open inside and can get kinda loud with crying infants and \"loud\" people in larger groups.  My criteria for wing places are: -Good sized wings, no mini wings -Fryer prepared, not just grilled or oven baked -Good sauce selection, flavor, and applicaiton (enough sauce to drip off is nice) -Not overcooked and too hard -Offers all drums or flappers if you ask -Good Blue Cheese dressing and allows all carrots (no celery) -Decent prices -Easy atmosphere, decent area of town, friendly staff  I think this place fills all of those points.  I plan to keep coming here unit something changes.",

    "text": "Finding Wild Wing Cafe when I moved to Charlotte from Orlando in 2004 was a blessing.  I was a regular at Florida's Ale Houses and missed their Zingers (chicken fingers smothered in hot sauce that you can't find just anywhere).  Wild Wing Cafe was the only place in Charlotte that came close.  WWC has over 30 sauces to choose from -- mild to \"wild!\"  My favorite sauce?  Jo Jo's Red Dragon Wing.  It's sweet and spicy.  And when I feel daring, I order the China Syndrome sauce...but pay for it the next day.  Oh well...  Live in the moment!    The prices for their apps and entrees (sandwiches, wraps, salads, wings, fingers, etc.) are fantastic.  Top it off with a beer on special and you've got yourself a cheap night out!     David's Chicken and Friends (diced chicken, hot sauce, bacon, cheese, and ranch dressing on top of nachos) on the appetizer menu makes a great entree to take small bites from occasionally when you're sitting with friends drinking beer.   And for you health conscious people, they have \"chicken feathers,\" which are unbreaded, grilled chicken fingers dipped in sauce -- also a tasty treat!  (But you have to order an extra side of sauce -- for 50 cents! -- because the \"feathers\" don't hold onto the sauce like the regular fingers do.)  Now onto the bad...  In the past few years, this Wild Wing Cafe has lost their liquor license 2 or 3 times (I've lost count).  For a place you go for wings and beer...that's not good.  Wings with Diet Coke just isn't the same.  And this resulted in server turnover...and poorer service from the new recruits.  Hopefully they're getting their act together and will revive WWC to the fun place it once was.  Also, parking here is a nightmare.  There's one small parking lot which usually fills up quick.  You're better off parking on the street into Ayrsley or in the lot across the street.    All in all, WWC is a fun, inexpensive, good-tasting place to go for a casual meal with friends.  Be sure to check out their website for a listing of nightly specials.  Especially on Tuesday nights when they have \"Buy a Dozen, Get a Dozen Wings Free!\"  And don't forget the sports events and live music throughout the week!",

The Mojitos were warm. The meal came out and the Gouda burger came out without the fired opinion straws. Our first clue should have been that the place Wasnt crowded at 5pm on Football Sunday... The manager did take off 35% off the bill - it's not worth the time - and the food was mediocre at best .

I observed the bartenders dip used drink glasses in water, wipe them off with a napkin, and place them back in the glass rack to be used again. The hanging glasses looked very dirty. One of the bartenders made a drink but forgot to put salt around the rim. The waiter who was taking the drink to their customer, reminded the bartender that she had forgotten to put the salt around the rim.  The bartender had an attitude and got another glass and dipped it into this nasty contraption that was opened with water and salt in it, she then poured the drink into the new glass!  The whole bar area was sticky and dirty!   My husband ordered the mild flavored wings and I ordered the ginger flavored wings. Both were awful! The ginger wings had no taste to them. When we got them, they were already cold, which means they had been done for a while but no one bothered to pick them up and bring them to us faster. We waited for our order for about 25 minutes!  In situations like this, I always point to the manager as the culprit! Poor management translates into poor service! Never again!!!",

I was sitting at the bar, it's busy and my bartender was dealing with another customer so I said \"excuse me\" to the male bartender because he was infront of me making a drink.. He ignored me .. He left and came back and was making another drink which I said \"excuse me\" again and he responded \"WHAT!?\". I've served before and never in my life have I ever came across a server/bartender that responded \"what\" to a customer...",

    "text": "Never again.  UGH...I absolutely hate giving bad reviews. I mean, there always has to be something good about the food or experience...to act as a saving grace to the review. So to be fair, I would have given this place at least 2 stars because our waiter was very attentive and they had a live band Saturday night which was awesome.   However...here is where they lost the star...my food literally made me sick. I opted for the turkey burger and fries and it didn't look appetizing but I figured not to judge a book by its cover. It came out on a multigrain bun, lettuce, raw red onions and chipotle mayo.  I can only describe the taste as bland and rubbery. Very unappetizing. To top it off the fries were not crispy or hot, so that was very bad as well.  The longer I sat there the more my stomach began to hurt and I ended up paying for the meal all night.  Not good, and I don't see any redeeming qualities and I have no plans on going back.",

    "text": "We went first night as we are from out of town asked to watch the quail hollow golf tourney that was literally 2 miles down the road they looked at us like we had three heads. Then proceeded to put it on the big screen we thought great, but they seated us in the furthest away table from the big screen it was not viewable from our seat so the server who was awesome put it on a smaller tv by our table. This Tv had a line running down the middle of it. The manager was on the ball and promplty moved us to a table in front of the big screen. We ordered the chef salad and had a good experience even though they were out of ying ling beer on tap. So we went back the second night had a good experience however the food was mediocre but the service was good and the manager remembered us from the night before. They did bring out our appetizers then two seconds later they brought our entree's. So for the third night we went back the service was terrible we had a new server who didn't know the menu at all and had absolutely no people skills. I ordered a turkey burger with coleslaw and my spouse ordered the chef. The server comes out and stated they were out of shrimp for the salad so we asked if we could substitute chicken for the shrimp. Then the manager came out stated that they 86'ed the salad because they were out of shrimp and to pick something else so my spouse ordered the chicken feathers with veggie skewers. Then one minute later they brought out my sandwich I had asked for no mayo and no tomato. The burger was dry and overcooked (or sat under heat lamp to long) the lettuce was shriveled and there was no cheese or onion as the menu stated. I sent it back as the manager came again asking what is it that I want on my sandwich I said I want what is stated on the menu with no tomato and no mayo please. So 10 minutes later they bring me a second sandwich and this one was correct. However 45 minutes have passed and my spouse received nothing while I have received two sandwiches. Finally the server comes back drops off the chicken feathers after I have already eaten doesn't even put it in front of my spouse and states want another beer? Really can't even put it in front of the person who ordered It? By that time my spouse had enough and just wanted to leave without eating. Did I also mention again no golf tourney on the tv we asked if they put it on the person trying to put it on did something wrong and had to reboot the tv so we asked if they could put it on in our booth again tv was not working it was breaking up while tv at next table had it on and it was fine. Very sad that they put this server out on the floor she clearly did no t know the menu and both the server and the manager had to look at the menu to see what the turkey burger came with.   The male manager and first two servers we had were excellent.",

    "text": "I gave it a two star because the food is always so good but the wait for a server to get to your table is crazy! I went last week and it was steady not to busy but not dead. Me and my 3 year old waited atleast 30 minutes for someone to come up and this was after I got up to ask who was serving us. The server got there we ordered a lemonade and water and since the wait was so long I ordered our food at that time, the food got there in about 10 minutes of that and we still have her to receive our water and lemonade, I had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. When the food was brought out it was brought out by a different server and we didn't see our server until she brought us the check. We got our own refills from the bar and had to ask a different server for different things! Worst experience ever and it was all because of they sever! I left no tip, I server for 5 years and to see this server on her phone sitting at other tables talking and not checking on us or making us a priority at any point makes me want to never return!",

The only negative thing I have to say is the traditional wings are a bit small I wish they were bigger but other then that the wings are always cooked perfectly And they have a huge selection of sauces to choose from . Great place to have drinks and go in on some all you can eat wings",

    "text": "Well after 2 years, I decided to give WWC another shot and went here for lunch with a few of my colleagues.    All of us were under the impression they still did the wing buffet.  Apparently they stopped that.  But they do the all you can eat wings and I sort of like the new setup better than the choice of 6 wings that are baking under heat lamps.  The new deal is you get a choice of soup or salad and then a choice of 2 flavors of wings with a total of 12 wings at a time.  So every one at our table ordered a different flavor of wings so we could sample each others.  I ordered the Atomic and Red white and Blue or something like that. I was looking for my own heat and then a cool down.  One of the problems I've had with my previous visits here continues.  The service is sloooooooooooowwwwwwww.   Salads came out 25 minutes after ordering and my dressing was wrong.  I ordered honey cilantro lime and received sesame.  Drinks also took forever to get refilled.    Also the spice levels are actually a step below what they should be.  You'd think Atomic would be hot but it was actually medium.  The hot were also medium and the medium were mild.    Add to that the the parking situation is terrible here and it just makes me want to stay away.  But let's focus on the positive -- at least I raised this a star from my previous review!!!",

We told him we'd be ordering portions throughout our stay.  For the first half he was attentive. Then he disappeared.  Our last round of food took forever to come out and he clearly forgot about my beer order.  Come checkout time I was charged $5.50 apiece for my beers but menu said $5.  He was incredulous.  He said \"I'll go talk to him\". I saw him laughing with the bartender then he came back and said \"you can go talk to him\".  REALLY??!!  I am never coming back.",

I wasn't serviced right away sitting at the bar, took them about 15 minutes to come up to me and when leaving I waited on my check forever it seemed like.  Business was not overly busy at the bar.  I come here for the wings.  I absolutely love the wings and knowing they having many gluten free options on sauces is a super plus in my book!",
