Accompanying my filets were a bunch of onion rings, hush puppies and slaw.  The prices are very fair and the service was great for a place that had over 100 (yes, you read that right too), 100 cars in the parking lot.  The food is what you'd expect from any fish camp, but the portions are ginormous.  The atmosphere is busy...very busy!  Try:  The Mahi  Avoid:  Ordering for kids (Let them eat off your plate)",

    "text": "This used to be our \"go to\" place when my in laws came into town. We haven't been in awhile and it seems that the service has declined. We were a party of 7 (4 adults and 3 kids), so that put us in the \"gratuity\" included in bill category. We didn't have any special requests upon ordering. When our food arrived, my father in law's meal was missing. No big deal...we figured it was on its way. 10 minutes passed without our server stopping by to check to see if everything was good to go. So, we flagged her down to let her know we were missing a meal. She said that she'd go and check. She later came back to say the order was left off and she'd have to resubmit. Meanwhile, everyone else at the table was eating. No offer for an appetizer or side salad to at least give him something to have to eat. On her way to the kitchen, she stopped to check on several other tables. When his meal arrived, the rest of our party was just about finished eating and I had one child who had fallen asleep. My FIL commented that his fried scallops tasted \"off.\"  More on that in a moment. Server has now permanently disappeared. So, the bill comes and my husband asks if anything can be done about the delay and the bill. We were not looking for a free ride. The rest of our meals were fine. But, we felt that there needed to be some adjustment given that my FIL ate after the rest of us. It takes 15 minutes for the manager to come over and they offer 10% off...my FIL's meal. That was it.   Fast forward to a few hours later and my FIL  became sick to his stomach me and was up all night.   Maybe it was an off night. Maybe they had other tables who were more difficult. But, we will look for other options going forward.",

Seriously, if you want take out fish, this IS the place, bar none.    The reason it loses two stars is the seating inside the restaurant.  One time we went we were put in a smaller dining room and the experience was very pleasant.  Enough room between tables and we could hear each other from across the table.  The other time we ate in the main dining room and HOLY CARP!  You can't hear yourself think!  The tables are stacked one on top of the other, and it makes you think that every person in Fort Mill is hearing impaired, because there's a LOT of shouting and hideously loud talking in that room!  I had such a headache when I left the actual enjoyment of the food had been long lost.  I think I'll stick to take out from now on and save on the Advil!  I've been in crowded fish camps before and NONE of them were as intolerable as the main dining room at Captain Steve's!",

When I we sat at the table, we were greeted with two basket fills of mini hush puppies accompanied by sweet butter sauce. It has been a while since I've had hush puppies and to my delight they were ta-sty! I chose grilled scallops as my entree, however had a nice sized bit of my friend's grilled Greek style flounder. Who knew that flounder topped with greek salad toppings would be so good. My scallops were grilled to perfection, with a little squeeze of fresh lemon. The baked potato was also cooked wonderfully and everything washed down well with the sweet tea.  The ambiance was great for a family dinner, but I wouldn't suggest it for a romantic night out due to the noise level. Also, be prepared to walk through gravel and dirt when you walk to the establishment, as the parking lot is not paved.   Overall, this restaurant proves to be a great experience. So you want a wonderful seafood experience, you must check this place out!",

We went tonight and I didn't want to get anything fried so I ordered the broiled flounder.  Came out and even looked odd.  Edges were crusty and too hard to eat and the rest of it was mushy and incredibly tasteless.  One person ordered a cheeseburger and the fries that came with it looked done, but were not cooked in the middle.  Tasted like frozen french fries that were cooked way too fast.  The server was nice, but the food is horrid.  The bill came and for three people it was $45 including tip.  I will NOT be going back here anytime soon, if ever.",

The line stretches out the door and sometimes out into the parking lot.  The hostess stand is separated between two sections: parties of 4 or less and parties of 5 or more. The line is for 4 or less and the seating/reception/waiting area is for 5 or more, though really anyone can use this area to sit and wait. You will be given hush puppies, and I would strongly recommend the Flowering Onion for an appetizer. The Grilled Chicken is wonderful here and I recommend it if you are not a seafood person. They also have fries, baked potatoes, and other sides. The only problem that I have with this place is the fact that you have to stand out in the rain, heat, or cold in the line to get seated. After entering, the waiting area is pretty warm or cool, and always dry, but the restaurant is almost always freezing. If it is summertime, please take my word and bring a jacket because it will be much colder than you like it, even though it probably is 90 degrees outside. But, in the wintertime, it is normally warm. Other than that, I strongly recommend this place to anyone.",

I have to say even the cocktail sauce was just right not bland. The ambience was nice, as were guided to our seats the restaurant was clean no litter or food on the floor. No sooner than people were leaving someone was there cleaning the table off. All of the staff we encountered there were courteous and friendly.

All well and good, if a little greasy, yet their alternates (burgers, other \"non-seafood\" offerings) were passable. This was surprising to me, as diners known for seafood have a tendency to bring that taste to everything coming out of their kitchen.  Oddly \"Mom & Pops\" feel, however, that has thrown my family off; they shut down the diner during the beginning of July for vacations. They won't re-open until July 16, or around there. Which seems...very odd, for a diner to do. Not to state that it is either good or bad, as far as the vacation, just surprising.  Good seafood, decent alternates, weird diner. Tremendously popular in the local area.",

Our waitress was friendly and attentive (although they were busy). The seating includes not booths and tables. They provide complimentary hush puppies for the table and sweet (butter-like) whipped spread to go with them- yummy! Our dinner was hot and the portions were huge! Too much food! My parents had catfish (on the bone) and they loved it. My mother is a picky country girl so her standards are high...she raved about her \"hot catfish\" and her \"hot sweet potato\"...of course dad did not complain, other the fact that he loved his food, my mom was happy. Points for him. Lol :) My husband had steamed shrimp, ribeye steak and a salad. He rates the steak at an 7.5 out of 10...salad was fresh and delicious. My fried oysters were awesome! And my loaded baked potato was good; the loaded toppings were put on the side in small containers. If you are looking for a laid-back, family-oriented seafood or American dinner spot, I recommend giving them a try.",

Very few restaurants, including high end establishments, can properly cook sea scallops, but Captain Steve's does every time!  It's impressive.  Even the shrimp is fried to perfection.  What impresses me most is there is always a huge wait to get in every time we've been, which is a sign that it's good.  If you are a party of 4 or less, there is a separate, much shorter line inside, and you'll get right in.  The service is always great, attentive, and fast.

The meals came with a gigantic House salad and complementary hush puppies, which were fresh and delicious. All of the food was hot, freshly made, of quality, and yummy!

It was Sunday and VERY CROWDED. Many parties (families) eat here I guess. We were seated right away, very loud today. The servers were nice and surprisingly the floors were clean even with it being so busy. The food was great. Not a big fan of catfish but I had friend catfish here with salt and pepper and it had good flavor. My boyfriend had the red snapper and loved it. Lot of fried foods, bunch of hush puppies btw. The side salad could have been a whole entree with the bacon on top. This place has sooo much potential to be a 5 star for me but I felt the server could have established a relationship more. There wasn't even an introduction with her name. But she was very nice and pretty attentive for a busy night. Definitely will come back here, maybe just another night during the weekday to avoid a lot of noise. Thank you Captain Steve for some good food.",

Their food is amazing, especially the fried baby shrimp. Every time I go to Captain Steve's I get the fried baby shrimp, if you haven't tried it it's AMAZING! I think every food is amazing just the baby shrimp hits the taste buds. I just think maybe Captain Steve's could improve on their French friends. I mean, I don't expect them to have amazing French Fries at a Seafood Place. But, if you are going to try and taste the French fries, then just keep in mind that they taste a little fishy. But hey, it might just be my taste buds. In all, I think Captain Steve's is an amazing Seafood Place. So, I hope you try it!",

We first got seated all the way in the back where servers and bust boys stood around talking there were plenty of other seats we could've had. We got our server Tiffani P...and she seemed like she didn't want to assist us. She took our order and we didn't see her until we were leaving. We needed corrections in our order and needed extra condiments and we had to ask bust boys and other servers to help because Tiffani was too busy helping other tables. I don't know if it was because we're black that our server couldn't serve us. My grandma was here visiting and we wanted to take her to what we thought was a family local spot and we were disappointed. Also the plates were wayyy to small for a pile full of food...please upgrade them. I won't be back.",

This was my first time coming here, but my dad has been here before and said it was worth the drive from hickory nc.   My mom and dad ordered the same thing, some platter, I forgot the name. My husband ordered fried scallops and fried baby shrimp. I ordered boiled shrimp and deviled crab on  the small plates menu . We all agree it was some of the best seafood you can get if you are not near an ocean! Everything was fresh and piping hot. I gave my husband a deviled crab for some of his scallops. We all agreed that these were some of the best scallops we've ever tasted! I highly recommend the scallops.   The portion sizes are huge. Regardless if you order a platter or a small plate you will not leave hungry and that is a Fact! If you are in the mood for seafood i would recommend you give this place a try.",

Service is really good, super quick, sweet tea is good, side salad is large and was very tasty as well.......I was impressed and very happy at this point. Then the whole catfish plate arrived, at first glance there was a toon of food; there were eight yes that's right EIGHT catfish on the plate. I stopped before trying the last two fish because they were the smallest ones and the previous one was so small all I was able the get off of it was some fins and batter. None of the fish were longer than my fork, the last two laying in my hand beside each other left palm and some fingers visible. If the fish are that small take it off the menu, I gave three stars because I saw other plates with ample food and feel I just picked the whole catfish at a bad time. I will definitely be back to try something else, the place was packed.",

We were seated immediately and waited on quickly- not because of his disability, but because they clearly deliver quality service. Our server and others were very kind to him, speaking directly to him, which doesn't always happen. Our food came out as ordered and quickly. The food was hot, as were the appetizer hush puppies. Obviously the food had not been sitting around, but was made to order. I ordered grilled whitefish, which was seasoned very well. My friend loved his fried oysters! Our lunch at Captain Steve's was a very good experience, and I will be back!",

I'm very disappointed and angry to be treated as if my hard earned money isn't good enough here. We had a party of 25 people. We had no issue with the party being split into 20 and 5. Even though there were plenty of available seats near the table of 20, the restaurant refused to seat us next to them. I have never heard such foolishness.   We even said that we would be perfectly ok with a different server and to split the tickets but, for some reason, we still weren't able to sit near our family. 5 people were forced to get up and go to the other side of the restaurant.   They're lucky it's my \"aunt's day\". It's ridiculous that she has to deal with the emotions of losing her only child and this nonsense today.   They won't ever get another dime of my money.",

This place has been around for a many years. Actually has a 2nd location.  Everytime I speak on this place, I tell ppl that they will bring you a TO-GO BOX when they bring your food out b/c YOU WILL NOT finish the food.   Salt & Pepper fish, shrimp  Not sure why in the south ordering Tea is heard as... \"PLEASE BRING ME BROWN SUGAR WATER...PLEASE...PLEASE\"... no biggie, its the norm around these parts. No knock on this place.   I always get the Create you Combo... 3 for (I forgot how much) instead of the Create Your Own 2 for (I forgot how much) your choice of BROILED, FRIED, BLACKEND Different choices of Fish, Scallops, Oysters, Shrimp,  Scallops are huge, Oysters are ummm OysterY  Hushpuppies are good... (I usually only eat 3 or 4...don't want to get full off fried bread balls)  -----   Only knock on this place is the PARKING LOT.......... ROCKS/DIRT. I just washed my car, all shiny and sparkley, tires lookin wet...UNTILLLLLLLLLLL!!!! EKK EKKK EKKKKK I hit the parking lot.   This location in S.C. probably offers MORE food to plate ratio.

The salad was alright, the Mahi Mahi obviously was frozen as it was dry and my onion rings.  Oh wait I didn't order onion ring but that is what I received.  So I asked them to bring out my baked potato.  I opened it up and I know the saying \" a little dirt never hurt\" but since they were baked the dirt turned to mud and it was all over my potato in clumps.  Needless to say I didn't eat it, sent it back and they offered me another salad as a courtesy.  Which I declined.   I wanted so bad to like this place, since it is hard to get my wife to go to any place that specializes in seafood.    The hush puppies were really good, but it is hard not to like deep fried corn cornmeal batter covered in honey butter.  Other than that, it was nice that kids eat free on Wednesday's which was the only saving grace of this meal that I didn't have to pay for their meals.",

I was pleasantly suprised to find that this place is so much better than the fishcamps that my family took me to when I was growing up.   This place sure packs them in for dinner on the weekend, so be prepared for a wait if you go during \"prime-time\".   They are not open on Sunday or Monday, so keep that in mind if you're planning a visit.   As with traditional southern fishcamps, your choice of beverages is pretty limited. Sweet tea is the house \"wine\". The hushpuppies with honey-butter are addictive, so be sure to save room for your meal!   The food is plentiful and good.  If you are not in the mood for fried food, they have a decent selection of broiled options. I went for the broiled whole flounder platter with a baked potato & side salad ($16.95).    If you're looking for good old fashioned southern fishcamp fare, this is the place to come!",

Last Friday I was here at 3:55pm (they open promptly at 4:00) there was a crowd already gathered at the door like a Weird Ul Concert - Out aged by all the patrons by several decades I easily pushed my way to be first in line, only to be caught holding the door for everyone except those in Wheelchairs and scooters (they were the only ones who did not trust me), once inside I decided not to run past everyone and grab a table without a hostesses assistance.  The SMALL \"Fried Clam Strips\" Dinner was a little over $8.00 with taxes added!  This \"Small\" was plenty of food (when you see my photo you can see how it is stacked) Stacked High on a large plate!  Five Stars for Value!  These fried Clams are probably frozen before they are deep fried, though they are still much better than most - A light color of batter and the thinness of the batter combined with the perfectly cooked (not the overly cooked too crispy you see in many places) then piled high on my plate made a great dinner!   Onion Rings, FRESH not frozen - that is worth some stars!  The flavor was good (not great) probably because everything is cooked in the same oil so some of the flavors are transferred!  The batter was good on these and like the clams they were perfectly cooked!  The Hush Puppies were A-OK, as in 3 yelp stars and no more, still better than many and only a few that I have tasted were a lot better!  The lady serving me was good at explaining that the Small dinner was quite large and if I wanted extra clams to make it a \"large\" food after I finished the Small they could add the difference - Great suggestion, though the small was plenty!",

Things you can count on from a fish camp style is huge portions, as much hushpuppies as you want, good tea,  and a family friendly environment, with lots of people... On weekends you will find lots of families & groups celebrating this & that or just getting together for dinner.. It isn't a quiet intimate type place.   If part of your party doesn't eat fish they have that covered... If you go on the weekend it is crowed and the servers are working hard, and even though they get your food ot fast, patience is a good thing to bring with you...",

We chose Captain Steve's to celebrate my sister earning her Bachelor Degree from college and thought that a Family restaurant would be the best place, unfortunately we were wrong. As our meal was ending our table of 16 people was approached by Becky and Sue Ellen where Becky proceeded to tell us that we were causing patrons to leave because we were loud. Hmmm, now we were sitting right at the kitchen as seen in the photo and I have never been to any Captain Steve's or any other family restaurant where you could hear a pin drop. If you have ever been to Captain Steve's it is not a quiet place there are large families all over the restaurant, conversations taking place, children playing or crying and laughter, none of these are whispering actions or scenarios.  Manager Becky was rude unprofessional and unkind to tell a family they were the cause of patrons leaving (which was unTrue). Later we were told the patrons left because they were ready to go and that no patron reported leaving due to us. Several of the waitresses apologized profusely for Becky's inappropriate and unnecessary action.  We requested our checks ($300 plus) and left immediately.  Our family will not frequent another Captain Steve's. Collectively we spent well over $300 today just to be mistreated for no solidified reason.  While you hate to think it was a racially driven scenario it definitely crosses the mind. It crossed mine!! What a shame! #PinkIsLove  #FormerCaptStevesFan Video of the noise level posted.",

The scallops tasted gritty which means they were not rinsed well enough. The entire platter was seasoned with a mixture of spices, which was, at times, overwhelming. The small popcorn shrimp was good but the large shrimp was cooked too long as they were tough. The stuffed crab was very good, while the flounder & oysters were terrible. The hush puppies were the highlight of the meal. The salad was very good & the sweet potato was good except there was an upcharge for selecting it. It was served with cinnamon & honey butter. The French fries were selected on the other two meals & they were just ok. Two of us had tea, which was very good, and the other had coke.  Service was ok but it could have been better. The girl brought our check & just plopped it on the table never asking if we needed anything else & she left. We had to flag her down to ask for a box. The noise level was horrible especially the table of 6 near us. They were so loud you could not talk over them. When they left we finally were able to talk but the level of noise was still loud.  Overall, I would not return to this restaurant again. Too much was wrong with the food & service to spend $56.00 again.",

The service is quick, the meals plentiful and everyone leaves with a goody bag. They recently started making fried lobster tail and it is good but I have had better. Started making fried lobster tail myself and prefer thinner dusting of flour than what they put. These are some of the largest lobster tails I've been served in a restaurant.   It is a very family friendly restaurant. We have friends who have told us they prefer the Fort Mill location to Charlotte. The parking area has been paved within the last year so it is much better for parking than before.",

    "text": "Came to this establishment on August 12, 2017 at 3:30 p.m. with my family after a Funeral/ Memorial Service for my cousin. There was confusion from the very beginning. First, my Aunt was told they reserved rooms for large parties. However, through miscommunication from the establishment she wasn't informed that they wouldn't hold a room on Fridays or Saturdays. Second, they (namely an extremely arrogant and rude Pacific Islander/Hawaiian hostess) caused further insult to injury when 'informing us' that our family couldn't remain seated together..   We were a party of 25. Apparently, they have a policy that prevents seating more than 20 individuals together. We were told they did not want to back the kitchen up, and wanted to keep the noise level down (Although, it was already loud in the establishment). We explained we were willing to break the checks up per table and order as any other separately seated parties, and we aren't a loud family anyway. However, they refused to seat our family together and 5 of our family members had to eat alone. Two additional family members were so upset they decided to leave the establishment altogether. There were several empty seats, near our table. The restaurant wasn't filled to capacity. However, due to the \"policy\" we couldn't remain together....even after explaining that we left a funeral, was originally told we could have a section, and the restaurant was empty.   On top of it all, when I was forced to order by my Aunt (it was her son that passed away, so it was \"her\" day) the food was just 'okay'. The fish and oysters were fried very hard. The homemade lemonade tasted like it was out of a store. The hushpuppies were actually pretty good. If it were my choice, I would've taken all 25 of my family members and gave another establishment my money. I won't be returning...ever.  Parking Lots was spacious.  Food Priced Reasonable  $8.95-$20; but it was only 'okay'.",

Our waitress seemed to be a bit confused all the time but our food was correct so I won't complain.  The lighting in the entire restaurant was way too dim, this isn't a candle dinner date night type of place. I hated that it was too dark. We would definitely come again but I can't see it being a regular place for us.",

One side of the lobby is for parties 5 and smaller, the other for 6 and up. It seems strange at first but the staff is able to keep things rolling and tables are prepped for new parties, quickly.  There is a wide variety of seafood with a few items for those who prefer their protein with 4 legs. If you visit, the fried food is their specialty. Never go here on a diet, you're just going to torture yourself. The smell of hush puppies and fried shrimp will overwhelm you. They aren't known for small portions, either. This place piles it on, hot and fresh. With the amount of people who visit each day, there is no way any food is wasted from age.  Most of the staff is younger and there seems to be a frequent turn over but with the amount of business, the restaurant staffs well and you'll always see a waiter around if yours has forgotten to fill a glass.",

My food came out on a plate and it was stacked high which reminded my family of a place we went in Maine when we would visit all the time.  The quality of the food was great!

To say I was very surprised when I actually started eating would be an under statement.  Nothing here was over fried, was fried nice and lightly.  I had the fried oysters, which were some of the best I've had, and yes, I live by the ocean.  Definitely worth the quick stop in, but beware of the crowds, they come in \"schools\".  Haha!",

    "text": "We decided to check this place out due to good word of mouth around my husband's workplace. My husband is a big seafood fan, and we moved to Charlotte from Florida- so we were eager to find a decent seafood restaurant.  In terms of ambiance, it's a very large and somewhat noisy place. Decorations are sparse, limited to some painted wall murals and a few typical tidbits (fishing nets, etc hung here and there). I think the noise level displeased me more than the decor, but I'm not typically a snob about such things so that doesn't really factor into my rating.  The meal started fine- their hush puppies are wonderful, the salad was delicious (and huge!) and the clam chowder wasn't bad either. Unfortunately we hit a major snag when we got to the main course. My husband's meal arrived fine (albeit after a somewhat lengthy wait, though I was willing to overlook that given we went on a Friday night and the place was pretty crowded), but my meal was nowhere to be found- apparently it was sent to another table by mistake, so we had to sit for another 20 minutes waiting on my dinner to be remade while my husband's food got cold. When it finally did arrive, the fish itself was fine but over-seasoned (I ordered the grilled Mahi-mahi) but I'd completely lost my appetite and did not really enjoy it at all. The onion rings it came with were disappointing as well, and the few french fries I stole off my husband's plate while we waited were not very good either- rather soggy and bland.  I'd like to believe our poor experience was an anomaly based on the other reviews and the good things we'd heard about the place, but given the experience we had there I do not think we will be going back.",

    "text": "Captain Steve's is a great \"fish camp\" style restaurant serving very good food and in very generous portions! There is plenty of parking and the restaurant has lots of room inside! It does get loud with a lot of \"echo\" such that it can be difficult to hear those speaking around you!  Much of their menu centers around fried seafood which is obviously what most people are coming to get! Just look around and you'll see the heaping plates of fried seafood seeing served all around you! But, as one who is trying to be mindful of calories, I can tell you that there are other preparation options available (Grilled, Blackened, etc.).  Yesterday I had a combination of Blackened Grouper and Blackened Mahi Mahi. I would heartily recommend both of these items!! My family had fried seafood platters, combinations of various items. All were prepared well and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. In particular, there were compliments on the fried oysters! And, as always, there was enough to allow for take-home boxes after we were finished.  I will say that the reason I didn't offer 5 stars is because there were not hardly any options for side veggies. They have slaw and you can get a salad of course. Other than that, you pick from potato products and/or fried onion rings. I would recommend considering some vegetable options to accompany the baked, broiled, and grilled seafood options.  This restaurant gets very crowded and there can be quite a long line of people waiting to get inside. Don't forget that they have takeout behind the restaurant.",

    "text": "Family dinner night at our favorite fish restaurant. Of course I started off inhaling the FREE hush puppies they give you when you arrive. It was quite busy last night for a Tuesday.  Our server I don't remember her name, but the entire time she seemed a bit jumpy and flustered. I'm not sure if it was her first day or what but she wasn't getting anything right.   I ordered the 2 fried platter and chose salt and pepper flounder with baby shrimp and a baked potato. Great portion size for me and I even had plenty left over for the next day.   As we all prepared to pay, our server had forgotten or didn't properly write down what everyones ordered. We provided her with this information, then along with our choice of payment. When she came back she was unsure who's order was which. She had our table mixed with another table she was serving. Once she had everything corrected, my parents noticed the senior discount wasn't applied so she had to find a manager to take care of that. After an additional 15minutes of waiting she returns with our sign copies and some how misplaced my parents debit card. My parents were completely fine with it because we could tell how frustrated she was with herself and upset she was getting. Again I'm not sure what was going on with her, but it unfortunately was reflecting in her work. After another 15minutes and everyone in high search for my parents card she finally found it in another check booklet.   She asked us not to tip her because of how horrible everything was but were not that type of family. We made sure she was taken care of. But I needed to share this so that Captain Steve's would be aware.",

We informed them SEVERAL times that the others weren't coming so they said \"ok we'll seat you all BUT if they come they can't sit with y'all(ummmmm didn't we already say they wasn't coming). Then while waiting for the hostess to take us to our table the MANAGER started pressing us AGAIN about seating an incomplete party when we already told her and the staff that the other 2 people wasn't  coming. She then started to get irate with us called the OWNER over, HE told us \"we need to leave\", THEN the waitress came over and told US \"THEY DONT WANT OUR BLACK DOLLARS\". You wasn't getting MY BLACK DOLLARS anyway because I wasn't going to eat that SLOP that y'all serve! I've NEVER liked your NASTY food, I was just going to fellowship with my family. Let's see how many BLACK DOLLARS you get now that you've been exposed to RACISM!!!

As evidenced by its vast parking lot, you can expect to wait most anytime, however, they are experts at moving people in and out. As far as fish camps/houses go, this place is tops!  You can get a \"small\" one item fried dinner for $8.95. Now, the term \"small\" is a misnomer in this place because it will easily serve two. It includes addictive hush puppies (the sweet kind), perfectly prepared cole slaw, a huge baked potato AND an additional side (I chose the collards). The flounder was expertly fried without being greasy, as were the baby shrimP.  Service was attentive and friendly. In spite of a jam packed dining area and more than 100 in line, or food arrived hot and fast! It was also remarkably clean when you consider the mob that was there.  I know it's just a humble fish house, but among similarly rated restaurant's, Captain   Steve's Fish House is a Gotta Try. In this case, the full parking lot don't lie.",

I explained my wife being celiac and she knew just how to lead me. Greatly appreciated.  Most of the customers seemed like regulars and everyone seemed so nice to one another. What a welcomed change.  The food took about 20 minutes. The smell on the drive home was incredible. I order the grilled scallops and jumbo shrimp. Also the hamburger steak. The meals came with salads and side. The family enjoyed everything! If the wife makes it through the night without becoming sick, we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "New to the area and not knowing a thing about Steve's, we stopped in for dinner because it looked local and it was busy.    Upon entering, I made the mistake of asking the host what their specialty was.  He looked at me blankly and said, \"Uh, well....everything is fried\".  He wasn't kidding!!  Not that I'm complaining mind you.  There are a few non-fried items on the menu, but after eating a thousand yummy hushpuppies with that sinful honey butter, who's counting calories??  The entrees are standard fried seafood fare, so it's kind of hard to screw that up.  I think the Alaskan whitefish is especially yummy.  The catfish is not my favorite, as it is breaded differently than I am used to - meaning it doesn't have a cornmeal breading.    Portions are enormous.  Like truly, comically, enormous.  Not knowing this, first trip, hubs and I each ordered a meal and one for each of our kiddos.  We took home FOUR to go boxes full of food.  FOUR!!!  Great place to just let kids eat off your plate or share a meal.    Cons - this place is busy!  Since the restaurant is large, there always seem to be many large groups/parties and that can really slow service down.  It is also pretty noisy so if you prefer a quiet dining experience, Steve's is not for you.  Me, I have two small kids, so no sweat.    Decor is completely kitchsy in a fun kind of way.",

They put us in the back room where a group of 35 to 40 were having a birthday party. They were extremely loud and boisterous, we could not carry on a conversation across the table. The service was slow, and the quality of the food was poor. The acoustics in this place are on a par to a rented mini-storage unit, low ceilings and no attempt to moderate the noise level. We complained to the manager, who apologized and said we should have asked to be moved. I replied that we should have been asked if we minded being in the middle of a loud birthday celebration, but this was lost on her, won't be a problem again. If you like mediocre food and lousy ambiance then this is the place for you. If you actually want to talk to your dinner companion and have an enjoyable dining experience then look elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is my favorite 'fish camp' ever!  Great food and great prices!  This place is always packed, and for good reason.  Don't let the crowds deter you--the lines move quickly.  Bring the kids, pop-pop and everybody else--I don't know anyone who doesn't love Captain Steve's.  It's a diverse, family friendly crowd.  Big glasses of sweet tea (or whatever you want, of course) and piles of hush puppies for everybody get us started.  There are numerous fried options on the menu, but also plenty of broiled and a few grilled choices too.  For many years, I ordered the grilled shrimp dinner (wayyyyy too many perfectly grilled and seasoned big shrimp, along with choice of fries or baked potato, and a really big and fresh side salad).  This was not on the menu but was sometimes a 'special;' but I learned that I could always get it if I just asked.  They're very accommodating when possible.  I think they may have added it to the menu.  It's my favorite.  One surprisingly good thing on the menu is their appetizer of raw oysters.  I love raw oysters, although I'll admit I'm no expert.  I forget the price of their oysters, but I remember that it's really cheap, and you get a whole bunch--I think we counted 2 dozen once.  They do not come on the half-shell.  They're served on a little plate with a bowl of cocktail sauce in the middle, along with crackers, horseradish and lemon.  My husband and I always pig out on these to start off.    They do not serve alcohol, which is just fine.  I do drink, and I enjoy a drink/wine with or before my dinner; but it certainly isn't a requirement, and I don't miss it at this restaurant.  If you're looking for fine dining, keeping driving.  But if you want some nice, all-around good fish-camp fare, this is it.  It's a little loud, but it's all happy family noises--you can certainly carry on a conversation comfortably.  It's just not the place to go for a quiet, cozy, romantic dinner.  Captain Steve's also does take-out of (I think) anything on their menu.  We've done this several times, and it's always just as good and prompt as dining in.",

The hush puppies are scrumptious and the friend shrimp was crisp and tasted fresh (I assume, I am not sure if fried shrimp can taste fresh).  Be warned however, tons of breading and a fair share of grease will leave you feeling guilty and sad, but not until a few hours after the meal is over.  Well worth (on occasion) in my book.",

She didn't check up on us but maybe 1 time. Another waitress brought me soda then she came like 15mins later with a soda and had an attitude with me..i'm like but where have u been? lol it was not crowded in there and there were plenty of staff to assist.

    "text": "Notice how a lot of the low ratings come from the poor attitudes of wait staff. I came here for the first time with my family, and experienced the worst customer service that I have ever had in my entire adult life. I'm not sure what the waitress' problem was exactly, but she had the rudest, nastiest attitude I have ever seen in customer service. Occasionally, someone in our group would try to get her attention with an, \"Excuse me miss? Excuse me?\" Each time, without fail, she would blatantly ignore that person and just walk away. But when she came back out, she headed straight for whoever was trying to get her attention at the time, which meant that she heard them in the first place and just decided not to acknowledge them. Her attitude was SO bad that it became a running joke at our tables that we probably shouldn't ask her for anything else or we may get cursed out. And while we were able make light-hearted jokes about the service so that our overall mood wouldn't be ruined and we could continue to enjoy each other's company, her disgusting behavior was by no means a laughing matter. The absolute last straw for me was when she came as close to my face as not even an inch from my nose to put something on the table. I had tried to give her the benefit of the doubt the first few times she'd done this thinking that maybe she had no idea how rude she was. But I found myself craning my neck and face back to accommodate her, which told me she was being rude on purpose. Common sense, even if you have never waited tables before in your life, would dictate that you walk around the table to the areas that you need to set things down on, instead of reaching over people because you are too lazy to walk to the other end of the table. I ended up having to physically push this woman's hand OUT of my face because that's just how close she was to hitting me and looked her in the eye like, \"Really???\" She responded with, \"Oh, excuse me\" with the same 'I don't want to serve you ANYWAY' attitude, which told me that she knew exactly what she had been doing the entire time.  I'm not sure if her main problem was that she had a whole group of black people to serve or what, but I got the feeling that she felt serving us was somehow 'beneath' her. However, the minute she saw money in my brother's hand, she became IMMEDIATELY nicer. There was already a gratuity added since we had a big group, but my brother told her that he was still going to give her a little bit of a tip over the gratuity. My brother likes to tip, so had she just been decent, not even above and beyond,  just plain ole bare bones DECENT, she would've walked away with a LOT more than she got.  The food was good and the hush puppies were AMAZING, but the customer service was enough to turn all of our stomachs. We won't be coming back.",

It isn't somewhere I would go for super fresh seafood (I would expect to pay way more though that) but if you want fried seafood this is the place to go. I got the fried baby shrimp, fried flounder, devil crab basket with a side of baked potato, hush puppies and slaw. I really enjoyed the fried flounder it wasn't over fried, I wasn't a huge fan of the devil crab but my boyfriend loved it. The baby shrimp were pretty standard of a seafood place.",

    "text": "A little drive on I77 towards FortMill took us to the restaurant I was hoping to visit for a really long time. There was a huge queue at the door but it moved quickly and we were seated in a few minutes. Looking at the menu, I saw what I expected to see. Fried sea food! But there were a few unexpected items too. Chicken Parmesan! And a couple of other chicken dishes.  Our waitress was very caring and helpful. She was quick to bring us the food and phased them so that the appetizers are not brought along with the entrees. The free hush puppies they give you at the beginning of the meal is alright. Beware, even the ordering the small platters will end up with tons of fried food. So gorge less on the hush puppies and the appetizers.  I got the Fried Flounder and baby shrimp with Onion rings. The flounder was mildly flavorful and the baby shrimp was again lacking the flavor punch. I do get that its fried food but the huge let down was there wasn't any flavors! I took a look around at the other patrons and they were taking home huge to-go boxes of fried food. When you eat the onion rings from say Buffalo Wild Wings, I bet you would finish up the whole plate - because it has good flavors even though it is fried.  The only suggestion I have is that a huge plate of bland tasting fried food is not what we need. Of course, everyone likes fried food - especially fried seafood. But if the management could revisit the cooking process to add more flavor into your fries and also review your platter and try to through in some non-fried food/sides along with the main entrees so that the plate becomes more appetizing and we, your guests don't get the sweet taste of oil churning our stomachs after a few bites of the entree.",

Hey! Don't judge.  We did enough day drinking so we figured it was time. Nope, not then either. So dang busy we couldn't even get in the door.  Take Two: The very next evening. Less people but still busy. The entrance is kind of confusing. They want people to split at the entrance based on how many are in their party.  Complimentary hush puppies await your presence. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and was pretty good overall. He was patient too because it took us quite some time to make a decision. There is so much stuff on the menu it is crazy. It covers so many different cravings. Steak, chicken and seafood.. oh my.  I enjoyed my steak with side of grilled shrimp with a side salad and collards. The plate came out loaded down (as you can see) with a roll, an onion ring and more hush puppies. Meat was cooked as requested and tasted good. In fact, everything tasted good.  We were indeed pleased with our visit.",

We were in a seat less than 5 minutes upon arrival !  Greeted immediately by a waitress eager to get our drink orders and followed up with a basketful of piping hot hush puppies delivered to our table along side our drinks .  The menu had lots of choices and tonight's dinner for us was a Grilled Tuna with a sweet potato and dinner salad . I chose the jumbo shrimp with baked potato and coleslaw.  The wait time for our food was less than 15 minutes. Seriously I could not get over how fast it all happened!  The food was delicious, the service was outstanding and we were full with leftovers! Why it took me so long to discover this fish camp I can't say .... but know this we will be back !  It was so good !",

    "text": "It's a fish camp.  Portions are generous, lots of fried stuff.  There is much to choose from on the huge menu.  The kids menu is a plus.  It covers just about anything a  youngster would want. I had Pete's combo; nice variety but way overcooked.  I expected some crunch but oysters were almost unrecognizable.  Food was well seasoned, just too much time in the fryer and too much time to get to the table left my  onion rings cold.   I hadn't been inside for a while.  Obviously they have done some renovations/upgrades.  I like the new look.  We were there on a Thursday evening, not too crowded but busy(it's really close to Carowinds) so we were sat quickly in a comfortable booth. There in is the issue.  At table 29 you have an unobstructed view of the servers' station.  No delicate way to say this but...lots of long haired servers standing, and hair flipping at the station directly in front of the open ice bin.  To their credit hair was technically restrained just not left untouched.  The worst transgression that transfixed me was no one EVER used the ice scoop.  Every beverage cup was dipped into the ice bin by every server hand that touched anything and everything in sight. The scoop was only used to fill pitchers.  I'm glad I always drink water, no ice, no lemon(these were plopped in by hand as well).  I don't think the intent was to gross me out but some re-training is needed asap.    Will I return?  Probably not to this location and certainly not to dine in.  I'll stick with takeout or patronize the location on Monroe Rd. It's closer and service is very friendly and speedy.",

    "text": "Everything tastes exactly the same. The most popular item(s) on the menu is the combination platters. They have several options and you can pick 2, pick 3, etc. All come with french fries and hush puppies. I like my variety and the ability to choose, but in the end, it doesn't really matter. No matter what you order it all tastes exactly the same; which is deep fried, greasy bread crumbs. The fish is tasteless, the chicken is tasteless, the shrimp is tasteless, everything on your plate including the fries and hush puppies taste the same.  The inside is extremely noisy and bland. It looks like your sitting on the inside of a elementary school gym. When you open the front door you're immediately standing in a line as if you're getting onto an amusement park ride or you're going through security at the airport. When you're finished with your meal, it's back in the line again at the front to pay.  The staff is extremely unpleasant. Since they have a \"shared waiter / waitress\" system they are not working for tips so they can care less about being nice or helpful.   to sum it all up: Quantity over Quality.  If you're in the mood for deep fried bread crumbs and don't want to talk to anybody and want to be forced out of your seat in 20 minutes.....then you'll love Captain Steve's. Honestly, save yourself the money and the headache of being herded like cattle and go to Captain D's. If you're like me and think Captain D's is disgusting then you'll definitely not enjoy Captain Steve's.  After going 3 times I'm calling for mutiny",

    "text": "We were underwhelmed by this restaurant. The food was low quality and not fresh. I had a salad, sweet potato and \"grilled\" salmon. The salad was bland - ya know, iceberg lettuce and pale tomatoes. The sweet potato was slightly over done and the salmon was not grilled in the traditional sense. It wasn't smoked or charred. It was wet and a little fishy tasting. My husband had salad, clam chowder and a steak and shrimp combo with onion rings and a loaded baked potato. His salad toppings came on the side in separate little plastic to go containers and it was just as bland as mine. The clam chowder was way too thick...like pudding...and tasted canned. His steak was fair, the shrimp was a bit fishy, the onion rings were cheap and the loaded potato didn't come pre-loaded...they gave him all the toppings in little containers just like his salad. We were given bland hush puppies with pre-packaged containers of margarine. The food was more along the lines of heat-lamped fast food. I believe Red Lobster might taste better than Captain Steve's and trust me, I'm no Red Lobster fan.",

    "text": "I have been visiting this restaurant for years now. If you love seafood as I do, Captain Steve's should be a great seafood place for you. As mentioned in other reviews her, you will be needing a to-go box as the servings are HUGE! Although the majority of the dishes are fried, Captain Steve's also offer broiled options as well. My favorite is the salt and peppered fried cat fish nuggets which are real catfish chunks cooked to perfection. Captain Steve's is one of the very few restaurants who can fry perfect flounder perfectly due to is fragility. The butterfly shrimp is good too and really plump. They give you tons of popcorn shrimp with each entree. If you love onion rings, these are the best! But most of all, what you will immediately notice is how fresh the seafood tastes. If you've ever eaten at a seafood restaurant near the ocean, then you know that fresh taste I speak of. Captain Steve's seafood is comparable to coast seafood restaurants. And this is the main reason why I keep returning and taking friends ind in town visitors. No one I've take has been disappointed yet!",

    "text": "I remember the first time someone brought me to Captain Steve's...I didn't really think to much of it; thought it would most likely taste like the Mayflower.  I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out my plate.  I ordered the baby shrimp w/fries and they were literally overflowing from the plate.  When we eat here we always have food left over for about two days. I ususally order the shrimp (baby or jumbo) and the bf always orders the catfish strips (salt and peppered).  The one thing that you'll remember is how fresh the food taste (and how much of it you get).  The flavor is full but not overpowering and the prices are fairly decent.  I've been when it was slow and when it was at full compacity but not once did I ever have to really wait for my food nor compromise good service.  For the two of us (one drink and one water w/lemon) our bill ususally come to about $24.00 (taxes included).  I also want to mention that they bring you out a basket of homemade hushpuppies with honey butter (complimentary) and they bring you out even more with your order.  They are delishious!  I also enjoy their homemade tarter sauce (just the right amout of horseradish sauce), its not too bitter or sweet.  It's already on your table along with shrimp cocktail so you can use as much as you like and not have to worry about asking the server to keep bringing you more.   The only down side to this place is that it's not open on Sundays and Mondays.  I found out the hard way by driving from the University side of Charlotte to Fort Mill South Carolina only to discover it was closed.  I know that there is also one off of Independence but for some reason I'm partial to only going to this one.  If you want fresh seafood, a nice helping, at a good price...then I truly recommend giving this place a try...you want be dissappointed :)",

They don't play any games so if you wanna eat they'll stuff you 'til you're full.  I had to ask them to stop bringing them, no joke.  The basket of tiny little hush puppies with honey butter were a pre-dinner dessert.  Best homemade Arnold Palmer ever!

The parking lot was extremely full so I expected a long wait- but was seated right away.  Friendly waitresses.  A little loud but it added to the feel.  Food was very reasonably priced for seafood.  I had broiled seafood platter, and all of it was cooked well and seasoned well.  Good portions- I couldn't even eat my potato or half of the seafood, had to take it home!  My daughter had the grilled chicken.  Three good pieces of meat, and she said it was the best chicken she had ever had; and she's a foodie.  I highly recommend, and will return again.",

Our  service to get a seat was quick but it's been taking a while for the standard hush puppies and our apps. Plastic plates is a new experience no silverware or napkins think we had a bad server to be honest. Portion sizes are good few photos attached to the page.

I had the grilled choice of 2 with flounder and grilled jumbo shrimp.  For $13.95 this is hands down one of the best values in town for seafood.  3 large fillets of nicely seasoned fish and like 8 or 9 grilled jumbo shrimp which was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  Baked Potato, salad and some of the best hushpuppies around.  Here's my thing, I don't like regular hushpuppies because their mostly overly fried and bland.  Captain Steve's are fried, but they have a hint of onion in their mix which makes them delectable.  This is truly one of the hidden gems of this area and should not be missed.",

I could not even eat the catfish until the next day there was so much food, but it's was great as well.

    "text": "Wife ordered some snapper, they screwed up the order but said they would immediately make some more. 40 minutes later after everyone else is done eating and every single person in the restaurant has had their order completed, it finally shows up. Waitress was making up excuses and basically said \"I told my manager, it's out of my hands now.\"  She didn't come back to check on us for 15 minutes. Very disappointed with the quality of service. Probably wouldn't come back again until the manager and waitress was replaced. Seems to be hit or miss on service. Food is okay but not worth the hassle we encountered.",

During this visit to Charlotte, she asked if I was hungry and I requested the fish camp (couldn't remember the name).   When we arrived we were seated immediately. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant is noisy but it's a fun noise. The food is seasoned well and the portions are huge! You will have leftovers. The hush puppies and honey spread are a treat. They should be a sin LOL.   My friend will definitely enjoy my leftovers - it's another meal!",

If we could have given a 4.5 for not having cold beer wth seafood, we would have, but I just couldn't give this place less than 5 stars. The line outside shows this place doesn't need our review, but it was the second most favorite place we have been that had such amazing seafood, so we had to write something!! (Our favorite above all is Cabby Shack outside of Plymouth, MA.) I had fried scallops and shrimp. The scallops were perfectly cooked with just enough sweetness and batter to melt in your mouth. As an aside, my meal was only $14.95 for two choices, and i had to take food home; there was just no way to eat it all. I wanted to, but I couldn't. How can you beat that?? My husband had fried scallops, catfish and collard greens. He added a little malt vinegar to the greens and then fell into heaven!! His favorite collard greens were from a friend who lived in Louisiana and knew how to make collard greens. With just a little added malt vinegar, this place's greens were just as yummy. If you're in Charlotte and you want seafood, this place is a must!!  Don't let the line scare you. There are a lot of tables on the inside, and the line moved quickly. Come enjoy!!!",

    "text": "This is the place to go for a mess-a-fried seafood and I do mean a big mess! Portions are huge so unless you're looking for the biggest meal of your life, order the 1/2 portion. A 3.5 would be a more apt score but well... That's not an option.  Pros: consistently good. It's not GREAT seafood. It's good. Everything I've had fried has been good. My fave by far is the fried clams and I order them often. Carry out is quick and orders are always right. Inside dining we've always had quick, prompt and friendly service. Definitely kid friendly.  Cons: broiled options aren't very tasty. Would like more options for sides Like mashed potatoes, veggies, etc. also a sub for hush puppies ( for us no onion eaters) like cornbread, roll, or biscuit.  They roll through the people by keeping the menu consistent, which is fine - there are plenty of options. A place I visit often and enjoy.",

There are even non-seafood items to satisfy nothing from the ocean eaters, like my wife.  Everyone can find something to eat at Steve's.  Try to come early on peak eating times, like Friday and Saturday nights.  Other nights are not a mob scene.  That said, they do get people seated pretty quick.  And if you have people from outside the South, this is a place to show them a uniquely southern experience.  We have taken new-comers, Germans and visitors and everyone enjoys it.",

A couple of things I didn't like. One, it was incredibly noisy.  I couldn't hear my husband at all and he was right across from me.  So if you have kids, or a noisy party, this is THE place for you.  I just didn't care for it.  Second, the portions are enormous. I mean just huge. No one needs that much food.  On the plus side you get a lot of food for not a lot of money.  My husband had the snapper and enjoyed it.  I had the boiled shrimp, cold and liked it as well. You get a big basket of hush puppies too, which is nice, but again, so much food.  We'll likely not go back, but I do recommend it for large parties and families with young kids.",

It's a very laid back atmosphere with tons of people and lots of food! Before my friend and I even sat down my mouth was watering just seeing the plates coming out the kitchen.   Once we were seated, our waitress appeared with that delicious basket of hush puppies and honey butter....simply delicious! They were bite size pieces so you could just dip them in the butter and pop them in your mouth and before you know it the entire basket is empty. Great way to start the meal!   For dinner, we both chose the salt and pepper catfish tenders which comes with french fries, cole slaw and more of those yummy hush puppies.   Ok, so seriously it's been said in all the previous reviews but I have to agree portion size here should never be a problem for anyone. These plates come out STACKED with food. So trust me, you will need a to go box.    The catfish was delicious. It was hot when it came out and seasoned really well. I liked that it was not just skinny tenders strips but l huge cuts of catfish battered and fried...just right! The fries and slaw were very tasty as well. Overall, it was a really tasty meal.   The price was right, the service was great and the food was delicious. Definitely will be going back!",

We also had the fried shrimp version which was a little better.  This is a popular place but I don't see myself needing to come back, it wasn't worth anymore than a ten-fifteen minute wait, anymore than that and I would go elsewhere.
