Atmosphere is loud bar-like with lots of tv's which they will change to whatever game you want to see. You can watch the game without getting any pressure to leave. I like that. Drinks are poured without too much measure so you are getting what you paid for. Had the shrimp appetizer which was surprisingly tasty. Pick a sauce and it will be brought to your table. Wings - go for the \"coach style\".   Tasty and enough meat to satisfy. Not like BWW which are small expensive.  Order the fries and slaw, well worth the extra 2 bucks. Tried the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Nachos. It was a weird bland taste. Like the girl sitting across the table. Not really a strong anything to make you think you're eating something special. Overall it's a local place I'd like to hang out. Could use some more comfortable seating but then maybe I wouldn't leave. Worth the visit and make up your own mind.",

The Hot wings are not bad either if they would cook them properly and stop bringing out ranch instead of blue cheese and leave off the celery as requested.  The only problem I have is the lazy staff.  It is not like I encounter one on occasion, it is every single time I have been in there.  The girls working out front are boring and have zero personality.  They often mess up an order that is not exactly the way the menu has it and the cooks are not much better.   If the staff, both cooks and wait staff would take a little pride in their work, this could be a much better place and I would stop in more often and when I am there, I would leave a better tip.",

Everything is homemade and there's a delicious dessert called the Dinosaur Egg which is fried ice cream.  One warning - don't have too many drinks and then leave this place - it's a favorite of Fort Mill Police and they are always around on that stretch of road.",

Avoid the \"really frickin' hot\" wings because they aren't hot and have a nasty Indian curry flavor. The next step down \"hot\" aren't. There is hardly any sauce and therefore hardly any taste and they are not even close to being hot. The sweet potato fries used to be good in both taste and quantity but now they barely give you any and they taste store bought. We won't spend any more money there until things improve, even though we can walk there from our house. If the bartender didn't also have an attitude I'd have some beers there but it's not to be.  **Update 10-June-2010** Service has improved, male staff much nicer than previously.  Overall a good experience (except the really hot wings - sauce is weird still).  Thanks for the improvements.",

Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.  Decorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.  Towne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.  Service is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.  Overall, it is a solid place to eat, and is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.",

Queso dip and gold medal sauce is awesome.  Get that gold medal on wings, boneless wings, wraps...doesn't matter.  It is great!  We have always been crazy about one of the waiters as well.  Haven't seen him around in a while, so we have now forgotten his name.  He was very very nice.  Only down side is the parking can be a pain sometimes.  Lot has tiny spaces and not enough of them.",

This place definitely caters to the older crowd. I am in my mid 30's and was way too young. Music was Beegees and the like.  As far as watching the game, if you count number of TV's, they would get a good rating, but with the exception of maybe two, they were all under 40 inch with most under 32 inch making the games hard to see.  I ordered 12 wings and a beer. The wings were not very good and didn't finish them. Bill was $18 which I though was way high for what I ordered.  I will not return.",

    "text": "This is mostly a bar/restaurant that caters to WNY transplants.  I myself lived in WNY for a while, and one of its few redeeming qualities is the food.  Towne Tavern matches 2 of the food staples there: the wings and the haddock fish fry.  In WNY, you get 4 choices of wings: hot, medium, mild, and char-b-q.  Hot is straight up Frank's hot sauce, medium is half hot sauce and half melted butter, and mild is about 2/3 melted butter and one third hot sauce.  Char-b-q wings are partially deep fried, and then placed over an open flame with sauce.  Towne Tavern doesn't serve those, but they serve the hot, medium, and mild to WNY specifications.  Yes, they have things like terriyaki flavored wings, but those would be a sin in WNY.That would be like serving iced tea from a fountain in the Carolinas.  The wings are made fresh and are very good.    The haddock fish fry is actually better than a lot I have had in WNY. It's two large pieces of haddock beer battered served with slaw and your choice of side.  Another favorite menu item is tavern terriyaki which is grilled steak or chicken with terriyaki sauce served with a salad and cold spinach fettuccine noodles.  The combination works very well together.  The rest of the menu items such as burgers and sandwiches are slightly better than what you would find at most bars.  The WNY beef on weck sandwich is okay but it's far from what you would get in Buffalo.  They have a good selection of bottle beers, but could probably use some more on tap.  They usually only have Old Meck Copper and one other one.  The service is usually pretty good here too, though the wait staff is noticeably younger than a lot of other taverns/bars/restaurants in the area.I also give them props for being the first bar/restaurant in Fort Mill to ban smoking, and oce they had the cojones to do it, most other places stopped it before the ban even went into effect.",

You can get either boneless or bone in wings. You have a choice of several sauces and then for small fee add fries and cole slaw.  The wings were just OK, I had the honey bbq and it wasn't anything too special. The fries were better than average.  The service was good, we had a table of seven. They serve draught Heineken which is unusual. Their sweet tea was way over sweet.   It's not a fancy place but it seems popular with the locals. It has a strong sports oriented vibe and I expect it's the place to be when the Panthers play. They have one special room for Panther games and many autographed game day jerseys.",

They know there stuff, are very personable, and check in BEFORE happy hour ends for another brew. Ranks high in my book.  They have Bingo on Mondays and trivia on Wednesdays.   We have had several of their food offers - Saratoga chips, island burger, and preztels. All were tasty and topnotch.... chips crispy, pretzels soft, and burger done as ordered. Also, all apps are under $10 which I am a firm believer in.   We have been here a few late nights with not so stellar experiences; however,  overall this place is great for a cold brew and good food. Bottom line, this place has grown on me so Bravo to them.",

I have to admit, the bar is pretty darn good and their prices are much better than your average watering hole.    I'm still not a huge fan of the restaurant section, but I'll keep coming back for more until I feel its time to reconsider.  Food is decent, service is just so-so...unless you're at the bar. Matt and Marley rock behind the bar.  Kudos",

Firstly the positives, our waiter was very attentive and checked on us consistently! Once we ordered the food did come out rather quickly even though the main room was packed for bingo night.   When we were seated the table and menus were so sticky we took some of the wet naps on the table and tried to wipe things down. That can be a one off situation but overall the whole place felt less than clean. My husband and I split nachos thinking that would be a safe choice (he didn't want to order food there at all based on his first impression.)   The chips were stale and some burnt and the toppings were minimal and sporadic. Friends got fish & chips and a burger which were also poor quality. I don't expect much from bar food honestly but this was rough. The icing on the cake was really when they started playing loud music in the side room we were seated... we don't mind a loud atmosphere but it was different music than they were blasting in the room 6 feet to our right which made it impossible to have have a conversation or even think. They did turn it off after we broke down and asked.   Overall was disappointed as a clean table and a little more focus on food quality and this place would be a staple for us!",

We loved the vibe inside and wanted to dine in sometime and we did on a Wednesday I believe.  it was $3 coronas night!! I had chicken club sandwich and wife had a salad.  we also ordered a side of smashed potatoes. BEST TASTING SMASHED POTATOS EVER!!! I have never had such deliciously tasting mashed potatoes ever.  asked my waiter (who is super cool, friendly, and very very attentive) if the potatoes were made in house and YES it is, even the gravy on top is made in house.  How is a sports bar doing such good mashed potatoes with gravy?? Oh and wife's salad was looking so colorful to start with and tasted so fresh and delicious.  I am sure they even cut their veggies to order and not use precut veggies (which looks dry and lifeless). My chicken club sandwich tasted just as good as I washed it down with $3 coronas!!! pretty sure we will be regulars here ;)",

This is a spacious place with a backroom for get-togethers.  There are many TVs to pick out the game you want to watch.  There are always specials and options for how much you want to spend on booze.  The wings here are solid...exactly what you should expect when you want hotwings.  Yes, they serve alot of bar food, but most of the food is pretty good, so don't be afraid to try something that isn't fried (unless of course, it's the fried fish...they know how to nail this).  The service can vary a bit...but it's usually quick and friendly.    This is a great place to meetup with coworkers, friends, or an afternoon of beer and chicken wings.  Try:  The fried haddock  Avoid:  The beef on weck (you'll want to go to Lebowski's if you want one)",

This was my second time eating at Towne Tavern, although it was my first actually at the restaurant. Both times, the food was excellent. Both times I had the island burger, which is fantastic, with sweet potato fries (served with honey).   My first time, I also had the funnel cake fries, which are delicious. When my wife and I went, we got the fried green beans, served with a wasabi dip, which was quite good.   I am only giving it two stars because of the poor service and atmosphere.

We always made sure to call ahead for a reservation because it would book up since it was such an awesome time. Yesterday I called to book our reservation for today. The young man that answered the phone said that we couldn't check in the day before. My husband decided to call back to check also because we had reserved the night before in the past. The young man that answered stated again that it's the day of for reservations. He said they open at 11am. My husband called today at 11:04 am asking for a table for 6 for the music trivia and the man that answered the phone said we do not take reservations and that there will be plenty of seating to just come on in. We got there just before 6 and the hostess said we are all booked up for music trivia. My husband stated everything that had happened even spoke to the manager who only just apologized, letting us walk out the door.  I would think the person you have answering the phone should know if you take reservations or not since they clearly do! Very disappointed!",

My boyfriend got wings it was okay not really spicy like stated. It smelled like straight up Tabasco. The ranch made it better though and the fact it was about 65 cents. That's the cheapest wings we've seen in a long time. If I was to come back I would most likely just come for the drinks and pool they have in the back since we live close by.

Appetizers are more of the same everywhere, but nachos come in cheese, chili & cheese and...jerk chicken and cheese variations.  Spinach and cheese dip is unique. Yes, there are wings...a whole section of the menu so designated.  Remember, this is also a tavern, so it needed bar foods.  Salad selection, six of them, which included blackened shrimp and a Greek salad.  Good sized from what we saw.  Funnel Cakes?  Yes, sir.  In a \"fun stuff\" category.   Nice, very nice selection of sandwiches, one category for chicken variations, another for burgers and quite a few special ones:  meatloaf, beef, bologna (!), BLT and fried fish.    There are also platters, or full meals which include much of the items already listed.  But there is salmon, fish & chips, meatloaf, ribs and fajitas.    Excellent choices.  I had the fish and chips and the fish portion was generous and not heavily battered.  I just hate the \"beer battered\" variety with thick breading that just soaks up the oil  Not here.  Lightly battered and done nicely.  Wife did the French dip with onion strings and liked it.  The tea and water kept coming.  So pleased that we will be back to sample more of the menu.

My wife's were all completely undercooked, not crispy at all. In my order, two of the flappers were like rubber. Totally undercooked. Two of my wings didn't really even qualify as wings. They were like nuggets on a stick, except the stick was the bone. See my photo.  In my opinion, wings should never be rubbery. The skin needs to be crispy, especially when doused in sauce. And a customer should never have to ask for crispy wings.   Also pathetic was that we each got one piece of carrot and one piece of celery, wrapped in foil with each half dozen. Not even worth the foil.",

Like, multiple requests- I was visible and everyone was struggling to keep up..But our waiter was great and wings (coaches way) were real tasty. Thanks!",

When rating these guys in the \"gastropub\" / \"sports bar\" category, they get a solid 4 stars.    I ordered - what else - the wings.  Hot.  They were as you would expect from a \"Buffalo Bar\"... excellent and authentic.  They were TRUE buffalo wings.  I also got them \"Coach's Style\"...  according to the menu - Wings are fried crispy, tossed in choice of sauce then char-broiled... and yes, they were worth the extra wait.  Service was fast and friendly.  Beer selection was ok... not great.  That's where I dinged them on the 5th star.  Highly recommend.  Can't wait to see a Bills game there.",

The bartender Matt is awesome. He remembers your drink if you come in a second time. The food is great. We have had most of the menu items and have not had a bad meal yet.The beef on weck is a Buffalo tradition. The wings are the best around. If you go on a Monday night there is bingo and on Wednesday night there is 30 seconds of rock music trivia. All are fun and lots of chances to win gift certificates for more food on a different day.",

I tasted one and it was really good, better then other wings we have had around town. Mac and Cheese- delicious, we all really enjoyed it. It was a penne pasta with gooey cheese and shredded cheese on top. We actually ordered an additional side once we tasted it.  Island burger- you can't go wrong here but I'm biased, it's always my favorite burger. The teriyaki sauce on the burger was a smash in my book. I would have liked a side to dip as well, really good flavor.  Steak sandwich- my mom got this and said it was really good. I didn't taste it so I'm not sure but in her opinion she really liked it.  Pretzels and cheese - ugh these were perfect. Warm, salted and yummy.  Funnel fries- do I even need to describe these? Lol   Drinks- so far every bar including this one doesn't have seltzer?! People... soda water and tonic are NOT Seltzer.",

Imagine my shock when I arrived with 26 guests to find our room, booked since Jan, unavailable, They had booked over our reservation with a bachelorette party! I had just personally gone in a week before to introduce myself & see the space I had reserved. Met with the owner & manager DANNY, saw space, confirmed number of guests, and even discussed table set up, tab separations & high chair necessities. The manager on duty called him when we arrived & he denied ever meeting me! Needless to say, we will not return to Towne Tavern. We had family from 3 different states come for this dinner, & it was very upsetting not to have our space. I will say the manager on duty did his best to accommodate in the main dining area, but we decided to take our business elsewhere. Thank you to Beef o Brady's for giving us the space we needed at such short notice! Have always enjoyed Towne Tavern's food, but inexcusable service on the owner's part. We won't be back.",
