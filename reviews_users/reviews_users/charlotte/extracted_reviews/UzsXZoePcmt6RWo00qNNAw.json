However, they do have a nice selection of beers (at least 20 drafts). Don't get me wrong, I always happen to end up here time after time so it must not be that bad ;-) Overall there's nothing spectacular here, but it's always fun for game days.",

I figured, though, I might as well review it for any of those visiting Charlotte on a whim.   Bar food was fried and greasy in the bad way. If you like your fried food crispy, this isn't the place to go. I had tried the fried pickles, chicken wings, and chicken tenders. The spinach and artichoke dip was decent, but a little too decadent for my own good.   The best part about the ale house, though is the $3 pint. They have a huge selection to choose from. My favorite is the Sweet Water Blue which is your basic Sweet Water with a dash of blueberries. It's a bit fruity, but guys order it too! For the adventurous types, I also tried the Shotgun Betty which is banana bubble gum-flavored beer. I couldn't finish the glass.",

Not sure why but the bartenders have all been equally poor over the years. Another place managers don't understand their role and also go missing instead of trying to manage. . And nobody understands how to control TVs. And also don't understand why people are in the bar.If you're going to come to work why not try to make some tips? And then of course there is the loud intercom from 1986 that shouts out \"table for xxx. You're table is now available!\". Constantly interrupts the sports that are on and also scares the hell out of you in the meantime! needless to say this always occurs ofcourse when the bar is crowded and something good on. What a joke on so many levels..",

    "text": "Round 1. I had a gift card to Carolina ale house and I wanted to give it a shot. I really wanted to like it as well, but unfortunately they disappointed. When you first walk in it looks like a typical chain sports bar restaurant. Which I like so I was excited. We were meeting another couple there so we had a four top. To start off service was slow. Which I can deal with for the most part. But what really got to me was our dinner. We ordered three salads and a pulled pork entree. This took almost an hour to get after ordering. To make matters worse the three salads came out but not my entree. My food did not come out for another 20 minutes after. At this point everyone else at the table was already finished eating. The manager offered to pay for my meal and packed it up to go. This was very disappointing especially because I walked into the restaurant hungry in an hour and a half later I leave with a meal to go. Since we were on our way out for a night on the town. I took the meal to go and gave it to a cold homeless couple on the streets. They were very thankful and I ended up getting something else at our next stop. I hope they really get it together over there at the alehouse it looks like a nice place.  Round 2. I gave ale house a second try. I'm not sure what's going on over here but there is clearly a disconnect with the staff.  The first time the service was really slow, the second time it was too fast. Asking us about Desert while we were still eating. And then brought our check over before we finished dinner. The food was good this time but we felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant and it wasn't even busy.",

Those problems might have been specific to that night, though, so I wouldn't make a big deal about it.  The food was pretty typical bar food.  I had wings, that were advertised as hot, but not really too spicy.  Prices were very fair.  The biggest pro was the huge beer selection.  If you are a beer drinker, they had a ton.  That night all \"Carolina\" beers were $2, a great special for a bar in the heart of a major city.",

Typical bar with typical bar food of typical quality.  The staff is less than attentive and I've been dissappointed with the level of urgency, quality and service on multiple occasions.  Seems like we get a trainee every time we're there, so turnover has got to be a real problem.  That said, no way it should take as long as it does to simply take an order on a new guest and get them a beer.  The prices are also less than ideal as a bottle of beer can easily top $5 and are often in the $6-$7 range depending on your choice of suds.  There's literally a dozen classier, better serviced, sports friendly watering holes within a two block radius - this wouldn't be the first place I'd suggest heading after a long day of work in uptown Charlotte.",

She informed us that the kitchen would be closing at 12:45am which we thought was odd considering the restaurant didn't close until 2am. She also told us that \"if we wanted to go elsewhere, midnight diner and redeye diner were just down the street\".

This made my decision because everything in Charlotte seems to close early on Sunday.   The service here was great. The hostess was friendly and sat us quickly. Our waitress was Brenda. I couldn't have gotten a better waitress tonight she matched our speed perfectly. She was efficient, personable, knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered steak and cheese and roasted garlic Parmesan wings. I'm normally not a fan of roasted/ baked chicken wings due to the texture. These had the same texture I hate but the seasoning is so good. I put them in the oven for more cooking when I got to a friends house and yummmm!! So glad I ordered something outside of my norm with a little help from Brenda. She also suggested a sangria which I loved. My sister loved her steak and cheese combo, especially the steak fries.  The price is extremely reasonable. I left much happier than when I came in. At least 2 other waitresses said friendly hellos when passing and another waitress wiping off the table next to me even asked me if we needed anything. I suggest trying this place if you have not. If I'm ever in this area again I would definitely return no hesitation.",

Our server stopped by to take our drink orders. It took about 15 minutes for our 2 beers and a mixed drink. We went ahead and placed our food orders. Our server did not return to our table to check on us until about 1:55 where she explained that the kitchen was backed up and offered another round. The 2nd round took 10 minutes with another 15 minutes before our food came out which included wings, a burger, 2 orders of fries with those items and the meatloaf plate. While our server only stopped by 5x prior to the meal arriving, she began to hover and stop by every 3 minutes. (We decided to time it)  Because one of our friends at the table works in the industry we tried to be empathetic to the delays but this was hands down the worst experience I've ever had in NC. The food was good but not worth an over hour wait. If we hadn't ordered drinks we would have left. There are so many options in this area- you should check those out and avoid the ale house.",

Beer came and was asked if I wanted a dinner menu. I said yes, and then waited even longer to order. Food came out faster than expected and order a second beer.  At this point I'm happy. Or at least happier as I was a little upset with the wait time. But As I ate I found the aus ju sauce to be VERY salty. And I'm a man who loves salt. I ate half the sandwich and then needed a glass of water. I tried to get a waitresses attention and none came. No one asked if I needed anything and no one stopped by.

We had the cheese fries appetizer \"Carolina loaded,\"  which means it comes with pulled pork barbecue on it, along with some variation on ranch dressing. It came out absolutely doused in BBQ and ranch, so much so that it was difficult to stomach. It was hard to find the fries underneath all of the sauce.   We also had the buffalo chicken wrap, which was nothing special. It came in a green tortilla to boot (not exactly what you'd expect, and not a pleasant surprise).   We also order the Baja grilled chicken salad, which was basically a chicken salad with a Southwestern twist. It was lackluster, even as bar food goes. For some reason it came with sour cream and salsa on the side (as if I would put those on my salad..?). The Southwestern ranch dressing was bland and barely noticeable. I didn't finish it, and that's saying something.   Overall, it was just...bland. Not memorable. We won't be back. There are plenty of other places in the area that have a similar if not better beer selection AND serve good food.",

If you are in the mood for a good craft beer or to listen to the game, then this is definitely the place to go. The food is not that impressive, mostly wraps and sandwiches, but on the flip side they are priced accordingly and you will not spend that much. Lost a star on service and also lost a star on food. If they get a better menu and bartender staff they are almost there, just need to change a few things around.  PS: Also update your TV'S.. Half of them around the bar are all fuzzy and outdated.",

We waited, on average, 10-15 minutes for drinks, every time we ordered. We were literally 6 feet from the bar. It was busy but not super busy...Plus, it's not like the servers were getting drinks for EVERYONE every time they took an order... just 2 or 3 here and there. My one coworker ordered a beer which never came. He had to order it again from a different server. I only had 2 drinks the entire time i was there because no one would come and take our orders. My theory for situations like this is that the servers already know they're getting an automatic gratuity added to the tab (because of the party size), so they don't bother taking good care of them.  On top of that, I got to listen to a large bald guy (presumably a manager) berate a server who evidently had screwed up an order. Not sure if this is how things usually work in the service industry, but I was surprised by what followed. He told her that she had to figure out a way to make them pay for the items (which they hadnt ordered) or she had to pay for it out of her pocket. I wasn't impressed.  I don't see myself returning any time soon.",

Our server seemed very frazzled and never gave us any updates unless we asked him to do so. He seemed annoyed that we expected our food to arrive in less than 1 hr. When the food finally did arrive, it was clear that most of it sat for awhile because it was all cold. 3 out of the 6 orders were wrong (way off the mark) and they never fixed the problem, even after asking.

    "text": "Went to Carolina Ale House (CAH, as they call themselves on their menu) for lunch in a party of 9. The place was busy, as has been the case of 2 other times I have been there. The joint serves beer and pub food with lots of TVs, great place to view games. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is what you pay and go for, not the food.  I had the special, a Greek Chicken Pita. Sounds pretty good right, chicken, feta, olives, etc? The problem is that it wasn't made with care, as the pita came soggy with olive juice dripping through the bottom, as if emptied from a can. Worse, there was an olive pit in the pita, which I bit down on, OUCH. Apparently there was a warning somewhere about olive pits... my question, why serve something with pits that can't be easily distinguishable? Great... you put a warning, can I warn you that I may not pay you if I don't like the food and walk out?  The fries are flavourful, but it looked like they were rushed. Straight out of the frier and onto our plates... fresh is good, but usually you want to run the fries through paper towels or something to get rid of the excess grease. CAH fries apparently come with an extra serving of oil on the outside, glistening!  Other folks had the veggie pizza, a grilled chicken salad, buffalo chicken burger, and the fried fish. I think I probably got the worst of it, the other food looked like standard pub food. I had the buffalo chicken burger before and I would rate it three stars. To be honest, if CAH cooks spent 1 extra minute per plate to actually clean up the presentation, that would earn them 1 extra star. KISS, Keep It Simple & Stupid. Nobody walks into CAH expecting miracle food, charge me $10, make me a good burger. Chicken pita would've been fine and good, why add olives and turn it to disaster, honestly, just stupid.  Will I go back, probably once in a bit, but their pricing makes it a rare sports event occasion  or an occasional group lunch. Maybe when March Madness rolls around, we will spend some time there for happy hour / game watching.",

I was on 1 hr lunch break with 2 co-workers,so we ordered our drinks AND placed our orders to cut wait time. WRONG! Our waiter (tall male with long dark pony tailed hair) took 10 minutes to bring our drinks and appetizer (fried pickles were so greasy). Now we're down to 40 minutes to wait for our food and eat. The waiter continued to walk by us like he wasn't our server.. didn't even stop to check to see if we needed anything or tell us what was the hold up on our food. After stopping another waiter to see about our food, the food comes out (we have 10 minutes left to eat). I asked for a manager immediately. My friends salmon looked bit off of (ughh) and the wait was ridiculous when it wasn't packed at all. The manager came over and looked like he wanted to laugh when my friend mentioned her half eaten food. He did discount our food---although we deserved it free. Then it took another 7 minutes to pay us out! Late for work!!!! If you eat there don't be in a rush, eat before you go because the wait is real. It's a nice location to gain lots of customers but they honestly need to hire more cooks, waiters or close down altogether",

Had to wait a bit for a table, but that was expected.  Once seated, the service was spotty to poor.  I think they had enough servers to cover, but our server would disappear for long stretches of time.   Good beer selection, but they were out of a lot of it.  On a Saturday night.  Took several tries to get someone, ANYone, to bring us a missing set of silverware.  Oh, and the ketchup.  Oh, and where is the wrap that we ordered the same time as all the other food?  Remember that non-chipotle-ranch you were supposed to bring 15 minutes ago?   Drink orders took a long time to materialize, too.  It was a busy night.  I get it.  You're a high-volume sports bar.  You should get it, too.",

We seated ourselves like the sign said at the hostess podium. We waited a few minutes for a server and finally one came and brought us some water. We went ahead and ordered two deserts off of the menu, which only had three to pick from. Our waitress then disappeared for about 15-20 minutes. We finally got the attention of someone in the food prep area and asked him if he could check on our order. We told him we only had desert and it shouldn't have taken so long. He asked us which ones that we ordered. We told him what we had ordered, and he replied that \"they were out of the two that we ordered\". We asked him if we could get the other item on the desert menu and he said \"we are out of that too\". We politely asked to speak to someone about this and he said \"you are talking to me\". We decided it would be best to leave.  I have been to this Restaurant in other cities and have never had this poor of service.",

We waited longer than necessary for a table -- when several empty tables were available. Our server took forever to take our order, to bring drinks, never offered to refill drinks, etc.   Then the meals came. Well, some of them came. 3 of our meals did not make it to the table until well after the rest of the people at the table had finished eating and we were ready for the check. Then, when the meals FINALLY made it to the table, it was obvious that the meals had been waiting in the kitchen for a substantial amount of time. One meal was completely inedible.  One could argue that the server forgot -- but we sought out our server twice to ask about the meals and he said \"I don't know. The kitchen is backed up.\" For a salad. And mac & cheese. But the steak made it to the table in time? Suspect.  I don't like leaving bad reviews for restaurants, but Ale House earned this one. Try another place.",

I don't even know if there was a manager working.   First round of drinks took 25 min to get. After an hour of a friend ordering chips and salsa the waiter comes back and said they were out of salsa. He also ordered a a salad and then came back 30 min later and said the lettuce wilted away. I even had to go to the bar and order drinks because she was hard to find. Another time when I ordered a drink it was sitting at the bar for a long time so I just went and grabbed it myself. I also had tried ordering a steak and she said they had been out. 2 min later another waiter passed us with an order of steaks. I went to ask her and she said \"nope there are no steaks\" as she was trying to stand in the way from me seeing an order of steaks behind her. After finally getting some food 2 hours later I asked 4 times for horse radish. She finally brought it when I was almost done with my food.   After all of this we still gave her a nice tip. Reflecting back on it we should have left a penny for the small effort she gave.   Also where was the manager in this establishment. If anything new management needs to be put in place. They should have been circulating to see how everything was going.",

    "text": "TL;DR: If I could give 0 stars, I would, *Beers are hooked up wrong*, it takes way too long to get simple pub food, pub food is served on disposable trays, you're better off going to Chili's.  If you're looking for either beer or food and you're in Uptown, don't go here. Literally every other place in Uptown is probably better for food AND service. Or better yet, drive to a Chili's or some other casual service restaurant outside of Uptown, do the 2 for 20 deal, and save yourself some pain. The only reason why my boyfriend and I went here was because we had just toured his office and CAH was pretty close, so we decided to try. I went on Sunday 8/14 around 5pm, and it was almost empty and there were plenty of servers milling around the back. Yet what should've been at most 45 minutes to an hour meal was stretched to two hours because of a bad comedy of errors. And I mean bad.   The fastest thing for us was getting our orders from our server, who seemed listless and didn't really care about our table. Not once did she ask about our food (which was crap, see below) and getting anything was a slow affair. My boyfriend and I ordered two beers from the tap. My boyfriend's choice wasn't available because there was too much foam coming out from the tap, which happens. However, my choice of beer (a sour ale) was completely wrong -- it tasted like an IPA, and when I asked the server about it, she didn't know what to do, so I talked to the bartender who said that they might've hooked up the kegs wrong. Really? I should've known from that one statement that we should've just left, but we stayed. My second choice wasn't available either (hooked up wrong too) so they comped my beer and I finally got one that tasted like the description on the menu.  However, the food was completely crappy (by this time I'm pretty sure we waited 40 minutes for food.) I ordered a chicken tenders plate and it came on a disposable tray, without the honey mustard or the coleslaw. I don't mind not having coleslaw, but the mustard was needed and I had to ask the server for it. Plus did I tell you it came on a disposable tray (see picture)? My boyfriend's burger was made wrong (he got the pimento cheese burger instead of the pub burger) but he ate it anyway, as we couldn't find our server again to get this corrected. The chicken tenders were over cooked and dry but the fries were okay.  Then it took another 30 minutes to get the check and the beer comped because apparently the server couldn't find a manager to get it off the check. Not only that, I saw a proper plate of chicken tenders come past us :/  Yeah, don't go here.",

Even beers took 25-35 mins to arrive. It was fairly empty at the time and there's no reason for that. The plus side is you might get some drinks on the house because they take so long to deliver.

They have a pretty decent beer selection. I elected for the HappyYum IPA from Foothills Brewing in Winston Salem that had a good flavor.   The wings may be a bit overpriced, but for the area and the quality it was not too bad.   I think the wings are really good and worth trying if you haven't been here, but don't come expecting to be in and out in less than an hour.",

We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer. The dip was extremely cheesy and delicious. I ordered 12 wings half habanero bbq and garlic Parmesan. The garlic Parmesan was good and the habanero bbq was good but spicy with a good kick. It was hot that i couldn't finish and had to dip my tongue into my cup of water. Eat at your own risk lol. My bf got the shrimp pasta. It tasted great and cheesy as well. Overall the food was great and would come again if we were back in town.",

    "text": "We were in town for a cheer competition and needed a place close by to eat in between performances. The proximity to the convention center made this our first choice.   It was NFL Championship Sunday and we hit the place right at the start of the first game. Our party of seven was seated within five minuets. They must have noticed my over active two year old and our clan of cheerleaders so we were seated on the second floor all the way in the back. I thought it was odd since the second floor never even remotely came close to being full, but on retrospect, it fit us well. It allowed the kids not to be strapped to their seats the entire time while not annoying the rest of the guests.   Service was quick considering the day. Menu seemed to be traditional American fair.   I opted for the grilled chicken melt on a recommendation from the waiter. Drinks came out quick but the food took some time. Luckily the kids were entertained with the billiards table right next to us.   Once the food arrived I was not impressed. The grilled chicken melt was extremely dry and the size of the chicken filet was a fraction of the bread it came on. My wife had ordered the grilled chicken zingers (boneless wings) however they came out fried.    Overall the atmosphere and proximity to downtown Charlotte entertainment is what this place has going for it. I would recommend it for drinks and appetizers prior to a Hornets or Panthers game (or during the game - lots of big screen TV's). If you're looking for quality of food, I'm sure there are other choices.",

The hostesses were not mean but not very nice.  I asked our server for raw onions instead of onion straws and they forgot lettuce and tomato.

The bartenders were all friendly and checked on us often to make sure we were doing ok.  We ordered the apple dessert to just have a bit of something sweet.  It tasted fine, nothing special, but it wasn't even warmed up at all, so you know it's just out of the box and not fresh made.  It's a bar, though so I wasn't expecting anything major.

It starts out promisingly -- it's two floors, and I guess was another restaurant until recently.  We came for football Sunday and got there early so we could pick a good table with multiple TVs in sight. The shine from the sun outside made the downstairs difficult to watch the TVs, so we headed upstairs.  The food was fairly substandard. Nachos, chicken wrap and hamburger all very basic and blah. Ok beer selection. Just nothing to write home about.  We won't be back. There are simply too many great places to go to watch football to waste time on a joint like this. I wish them well - I'm sure it caters to some people perfectly.",

This location in the Charlotte Plaza building (black-glassed building, formerly emblazened by the Grant-Thornton logo... but now houses the Charlotte School of Law).  It shares the lower commercial space with Panera.  There is a lunch rush here, but I think it's not as much since it is a sit-down type place and not super quick, unless you sit at the bar.  There's a large bar located smack in the center of the restaurant space with a ton of TV's everywhere.  Tap handles galore in the center of the bar - I'm sure the place is pretty kickin' during football season.  There is also a fairly large outdoor patio that is pretty nice during the fall, but since there aren't any tall trees nearby, it can get fully exposed to the sun.",

Service was efficient, however you can quickly get forgotten in the crowd and don't bother trying to be social with the workers, they are very busy.  The downside was perhaps the worlds worst DJ, major ADD, songs played for 1 minute and switched - not crossfaded - and blaring (to be fair I think it was some kind of game I came on the end of).  I'll likely be back for the beer selection and fries, hopefully on a less popular night.",

If there is anything going on that isnt game day related or your not uptown during the lunch rush I strongly suggest it. The location is convenient to some reasonable parking. It is also walkable to various things to do uptown and also public transportation.  Can get crowded around game time or any other events but wait and service is never too shabby. Staff is pretty relaxed and knowledgeable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because sometimes they can be a little too relaxed.  I will always recommend the wings and bbq stuff. I'm a slaw and beans kinda gal and thats my favorite pair here. Great bar service with good quality drinks.  Prices are good for the amount and quality of food you get. I always recommend.",

I'm not sure the bartender on this particular night knew what he was doing. It's really hard to mess up a gin & tonic, but somehow this guy did on two repeated tries. After a second failed attempt I gave it back and opted for water. Overall, this place was a major disappointment. I don't remember my experience being this poo back in 2016.

Awful  Second, it was kind of crowded (not too bad though) when we got there but service was so slow. Then, it got SUPER crowded. We went outside because there was no air Circulation inside. We literally sat there for 25 mins and asked a server to help us and she said, \"oh who's helping you?  Because it's not me.. let me get someone\" like, wtf kind of service is that?   We convinced a lady to serve us finally and she was sweet, but very slow. It took 47 minutes for her to come tell us the keg was gone for the beer we wanted... oh... ok.  The ONLY reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the brand manager (or branch, I can't remember what she said) Dana was standing next to us and I complained not knowing who she was and she literally took care of our entire tap. And magically got the keg replaced for the beer we wanted. It's amazing how that happened   Anyways, service stinks but management seems to want to make everyone happy. AND she was Eagles fan. Win all the way around   #flyeaglesfly",

The manager Dee is very professional and helpful and see's to it that your experience was great or does everything to fix it if something was not as expected. I aldo have a particular waitress that I request every time I go because she has been one of the best I have had at this particular restaurant, I want to say her name is Nani and I would suggest anyone request her if you go here.  The food is scratch made and the new items added to the menu are tasty. I would recommend this location to anyone in the uptown area, but suggest you not go a game night if you are in a rush, due to the place being packed and it may take a little longer to get your food than usual. Great place!!!",

The prices, however, are pretty decent and you won't feel like you overpaid for anything. The cocktail prices are also pretty decent.

We also figured they had a lunch menu and even more reasonable prices. They do have a lunch menu, but it was not very impressive. I do wish there were more options on the lunch menu, but if you found something it was a pretty good deal where you could choose half a sandwich, soup, or salad for $5.99. The rest of the prices are pretty fair too though.  I tried the Parmesan garlic wings, which were pretty good, and tried some beer-battered fries, which were also good. I heard good things about the cod fish sandwich and the tacos.  It was a good, decently priced lunch option that we were able to do quickly.",

The crust was too thick while the bread was too thin which clearly meant a wrong choice of bread. I've had worse reubens in my adventure around Charlotte but I've certainly had much better as well.

Shortly after she came back to ask for our order. I asked if there was an option for a soup and salad or soup and sandwich combo. She looked at our 6 person table, muttered to herself, and then walked back to the hostess stand to get one lunch menu--we didn't even know this was an option as she didn't originally give us one at 1pm on a Tuesday. She placed one lunch menu in front of me and proceeded to try to get my order, I picked something quickly but our entire group was interested in seeing that menu while she was impatiently trying to get the food in. It was just a weird situation, we appreciated getting the order in promptly--but it was lunch time, and we wanted to check out those options too.   After the order went in the wait was relatively quick for how busy they were--great job to the back of house staff on pumping out orders! However, once our food was dropped off--without silverware--we didn't see our server for over 10 minutes. At this point, one of our party was still waiting on a side of ranch and all of us needed a drink refill (water and tea only). We asked for these items and it took another 5 minutes to see her.   I understand having a bad day, but it just put a really bad taste in all of our mouths about going back. The food was okay, nothing amazing--but nothing to complain about. Prices were good and the atmosphere is laid-back.",

After listening to what happened, he sent a gift certificate in the mail allowing us to try Carolina Ale House again. We happened to be at the Concord Mills mall this past weekend and decided to eat at the Carolina Ale House there. Fantastic food, our server Kim was awesome and it was a much better experience than what we had at the Uptown location. Thanks again Tyler for listening and I really appreciated the gift certificate. I would go back to this location any day!",

We went to Carolina Ale House, sat down and waited...waited...and waited.  A young woman took our order but seemed annoyed at us for asking for food.  She didn't want to write it down and attempted to remember our order.  i figured it may have been a bad night but she was very attentive to other guest.  The appetizer was way too salty to eat so we sat it to the side.  No need to complain because we had meals coming and honestly we shouldn't have been eating so late at night.  We received the meals and a side was missing.  Another woman brought it to us and she was extremely pleasant.  We said thank you and she actually responded with your welcome.  Security was also pleasant.  Unfortunately our meals were too salty to eat also so we bagged them to go but i don't know why.  We cant eat them.  Overall: Pros: TV's close to tables, location, clean bathrooms  Cons: Uneatable salty food No refills on sodas Poor customer service Parking",

I have a rule that if a place can't cook a good burger and fries, everything else will be bad. This burger wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.

Was surprised that Oktoberfest was still on the menu so I tried to order that, heh.  It wasn't--they should update their menu or say something like \"seasonal\"  Disappointed at how the hostess had no idea about birthday desserts as their menus advertised.  Told them while we had a few drinks, that we're here for a friend's bday and we'd like to get the birthday dessert. She had no idea what I was talking about.  So I had to track down our 20yr-old waitress who was able to get a dessert for him.    Doesn't their menu say you get your choice of dessert for free if it's your birthday or something?  I really didn't get to choose, she just brought out an average chocolate cake slice or something without a candle, just a slice, very unceremonious.  End of the night, I told her that I'd be paying for the dessert (as a joke, bc she acknowledged to me that it was free).  I find out later from a buddy that the cake wasn't free and that HE paid for it.   So: (1) it wasn't free; and (2) the wrong person got charged.  Yeah, it's not like the premier place to celebrate a birthday, maybe just grab drinks after work - like we did.  Shouldn't say that dessert is free if it isn't though :/  dmo out.",

We were seated and waited another 5 minutes or so for our waiter to appear. He started telling us about all the drafts which is great, but hostess had forgotten to give us a drink menu. He disappeared for another 5 minutes before returning with waters and the drink menu.  Great beer selection. About 75 beers on draft and another 90 or so bottles. We ordered beers and nachos with pulled pork to start. Drinks and nachos came out very quick. Nachos were cold and pork on top was in huge chunks rather than pulled which made it tough to eat. Entrees came out quick too and were better... We had boneless chicken wings and fish & chips.   Overall an ok experience. Lots of TVs so we could enjoy the games. Restaurant was very cold where we were seated so we were happy to move on once we had eaten.",

The downstairs was crowded, with several people scrambling for standing room in the bar area to watch college football, basketball and hockey.   After a short wait, we were led to the desolate upstairs seating area, which included a full (closed) bar and a rarely used pool table. Several customers in need of a drink approached the upstairs bar to avoid the crowded bar downstairs, only to be denied service. Many times I saw these potential customers walk right out of the door to other establishments.  Management is the main problem here. Carolina Ale House needs to re-assess its interpretation of hospitality and re-educate this particular crew of managers.   I'm certain that the Moshakos family did not intend for their restaurant concept to be a half-used space in the busy entertainment district of Uptown Charlotte. This place won't be in business for long if they continue to let revenue slip away in situations like this.  I won't be going back until the ratings tick up a bit.",

Not only does this place offer a welcomed reprieve from the hip and trendy establishments and people that populate the EpiCenter, but its also littered with screens, a friendly staff and the food is surprisingly - good.   I've been here three times since it was opened this past fall.  This is a great spot to watch any big game, especially Monday or Thursday Night football.    The honey bbq wings are awesome!  The are savory and crisp, but not overcooked.  I've also had a chance to try the chicken quesadillas and the chicken melt wrap - both of which are are delicious and are can't miss menu options if you don't know what to order.  I prefer to sit at the bar when at Carolina Ale House.  To be honest, I've never sat at a table, but I can vouch for the service of the bartenders.  Other than say, Fox and Hound, this might be the best spot to watch a big game in uptown Charlotte!",

My boyfriend have grilled fish tacos and enjoyed those as well. I had a hard time choosing bc I saw more than just bar food. There were several healthy and low carb options that you rarely see at bar/restaurant. Being a Louisiana girl I love that they have Abita on tap! We will definitely come back for more wings :)",

    "text": "Solid downtown sports bar.  I have stopped by a couple times on Saturday night around 10:00pm after catching something at the performing arts center but wanting to grab a small meal and see the end of some of the evening college football games.  It's a nice place to watch a game, and they have always had tables available when I have arrived. It's not nearly as crazy as the next door epicenter if you are not up for the epicenter craziness on the weekend.  They have large list of draft craft beers about 50.  They run out of a few on the weekend (I think they have limited storage space for the mini kegs) but worst case is you have 35 to choose from  I have gone with simple foods like sliders, quesadilla(s), or soft tacos, but everything has been good that I have tried.  I have had good service.  They have a circular bar in the  middle with tables around the outside. So, I think it is a hard place to wait tables because you cannot see all your tables at once.  Solid Choice.  They do offer parking validation in the Charlotte Plaza parking deck in the evening. They are on the front side of the CP office building.",

    "text": "A big FU to the waitress last night at the Carolina Ale House in Downtown Charlotte.  First, my two beer glasses were filthy. No apology, no acceptance of responsibility.  Second, we ordered wings and we were never asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese, a very typical side item.  You also failed to provide plates for the bones.  Third, when I ordered a simple cheese burger, I told the waitress exactly what I wanted. She came back with all of those specific items missing and asked if there was anything else I would like.  I politely responded by mentioning those items and she said she would be right back, so I waited.  15 minutes later, my burger is too cold to enjoy.  When she caught my eye, she said she remembered and will go get those items.  I said, never mind, just take my food and bring me the check, I'm done here.    However, I still felt obligated to tip.  Because, if I didn't tip, I'm sure she would have walked away and said; 'there goes another nigger that does not tip'.  And, I was not going to give her the satisfaction.  Besides, the bus boy and bartender did nothing wrong to lose my support.  So, she benefits because of them.  So, I gave the lowest amount I have in many years, 17%.  But, this waitress was f'n lousy.  Her name is Heather M (according to my sales receipt), so avoid her.  I'm sure the establishment is fine.",

Waited a while then what I expected happened.  The bartender who was not real with it brought out both together.  When I said I wanted the soup first she said \"I did not know\".  I said \"who orders both together\".  Please take it off.  She gave me attitude.  Then guy next to me orders a salad and a meal and she asked \"do you want your salad out first\" he said yes and looked at me and said \"is she kidding?\".  Went to eat the sandwich and fries were cold.  I could not get their attention to get a knife and fork so when I finally did I said \"I will pay for the beer and I am leaving\".  Went to Mortimers and had a completely different experience.  If you are just drinking beer Carolina Ale House is fine but if eating walk past it.",

My server was okay, but this didn't overcome the fact that there were dirty dishes stacked up in the dining area when I first walked in and when I was leaving. Not a good indicator of cleanliness or sanitary conditions.  I also saw a server wipe his mouth with his bare hand and then with the same hand hold a glass by the area where some is going to put their mouth. This happened at least twice. I mean really?  This is pretty disgusting.   I don't think anyone in thus restaurant values the importance of proper hand washing. Or they really just don't care. And I don't think management or ownership cares about food quality either. I do know I won't eat here again.",

    "text": "My wife likes football but does not understand it.  I understand it but do not care for it. We were looking for a place we could walk in during the Saturday afternoon games and be seated immediately with various table options, and Carolina Ale House did not disappoint. Nobody spoke to us when we walked in, so we were able to pick our own table.  There were so many options!  Nearly every table was available.  Carol wanted to sit at one of the high tables, but remembering how difficult it was to get her up in a high chair at Applebee's last week, I talked her into a standard-height table by the window.    It took 10-15 minutes for any of the hostesses or waitresses to notice us.  This was ideal, as it gave us ample of time to take in our surroundings. Plus, nothing is worse than an overly attentive restaurant staff.  We have only been in Charlotte for a year or so, and have been looking for places the locals go.  I think its safe to say we've found it! The 3 people sitting at the bar looked like they had been coming for years, as did the homeless man stumbling around outside the window.    Our waitress finally came over with menus, and we started to look through the beer list.  My wife is generally picky when it comes to beer, so she ordered a bud light.  I am really getting into the craft beer scene, so I asked for a Yuengling draft.  The waitress returned 15 minutes later with the bud light, and informed me that the Yuengling keg was empty.  Plan B was a Rolling Rock, which was delivered swiftly at room temperature.  Despite the 2:1 waitress/patron ratio, our server had no sense of urgency.  Although we had time to thoroughly read through the menu, we looked no further than the appetizers. Carol went with the Bacon Cheese Fries and I asked for the Five-Cheese Spinach Dip with the spinach on the side. After delivering our order to the kitchen our waitress stepped out for a cigarette and then  stopped by to check in on us, at which point we ordered another round of beers.    We couldn't see any of the TVs from where we were sitting, but we knew where they were and looked forward to catching a glimpse on our way out.  Our food came out 5 minutes later and was cold.  It seemed like the food was prepared and served the night before, returned, refrigerated and re-heated, or was never cooked in the first place. I hoped it was the former, but either explanation would be fine with me.  I hate to see good food go to waste, but I would also feel bad if they fired up the oven just because we were there.  We had a great experience at Carolina Ale House, and look forward to dining there again.",

Time and time again I have called this place and be given an order wait time of 15-20 minutes. I'm literally waiting right now and it's been 68 minutes. And still waiting  3) wait staff outdoors - with a nice seating arrangement you would expect multiple wait staff outside but again, the ale house management seems to think that 1 person is enough  Save your money but more importantly save your time cause I guarantee that is the one thing you will leave here without.",

The fist server to half of the tables order and told us the other waitress would come and take the other half of the table order. Mind you we had already placed our drink orders that took about 15 minutes to come. We waited for 20 minutes before we had to stop our waitress and ask her was she going to take our half of the table order. Of course this through the whole night off. The other half of the table hit their food way before our half of the table did. It was another 20 minutes before our half of the table got our good. Granted both waiters came out and apologized for not being on the same page and for not submitting all the orders at once. She said the manager scolded them for submitting them separate at different times. When we asked to speak to the manager he flipped it and said well you guys are a large party things take a while. Not to mention our orders came out wrong. At this point I'm to hungry to send my order back so I just kept it and ate it. A few other people refused to keep there orders. We ask for the manager again. Let me just say he lacked good customer service. I wasn't looking for a free meal but I feel he could have did a little more to rectify the situation. His response was well I will take back what you didn't eat but you're paying for your drinks. I was pretty much over it by this point. I feel the manager needs a lot more training.",

I instead had to wait at my table for another three minutes so my waiter could bring it to be. Stupid protocol.  So, I had a sweet tooth and desired a CAB Mud Pie. Of course they were out of them.  So, I deferred to the Homemade Apple Cobbler. The description was awesome. The product not so much. Melted ice cream over a mess of applesauce and other not so tasty filler. Avoid at all costs.

    "text": "This has probably been the longest meal I've ever waited for in my life. Let me first say that we came here after the Carolina Panthers football game, so a large crowd with a bit of a wait was to be expected. So when the hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait, we understood. Well that 45 minutes turned to well over an hour and once we got seated 10 minutes went by and no server came to our table. We basically had to stop a server and ask us to serve us.  After placing our orders, we waited another hour just to receive our appetizers and about another 30 minutes before our meals finally arrived. I'm not the type to be politically correct, so I'll be quite frank; it was particularly disturbing because after we were finally seated and waiting, we noticed other tables of other races that were seated after us receiving their meals. After we finally got our meals and ate we were one of the last tables still there because everyone else had finished their food and left.   I hate writing long, negative reviews but I felt I had to do it after this experience. We received no apology from management and not even the slightest sign of gratitude for our patience. Safe to say that was my first and last time at this poor excuse for a restaurant.",

Sat at the bar 2 days in a row, and identical service - the bartender was too busy checking her phone, or carrying on conversations with friends.   Food was good, prices were real reasonable as well.   It's bad when the manager takes my order because she didn't notice my empty glass and next time takes even longer. And I'd bet that the bar still isn't wiped down yet after he asked her to 30 minutes earlier.   Nice place, but I'd get a table and hope for a good server.",

The staff did a wonderful job taking care of all our needs super fast and got us out the door in time for the game.

Service was ok, I was greeted right away by the bartender, but the host stand had about 6 people at it, none of who acknowledged people walking in, they were crowded around their phones.  I got the buffalo chicken sandwich, it was pretty good, right amount of heat and a decent size breast. The fries were meh, mostly soggy and very few of them. I think they were getting ready to close or something (this was about 9pm), everyone seemed to be doing their side work and trying to close up. Beer was decently priced though.

They don't offer a list of those taps so you have to rely on your server. However, your server won't know jack sh!t about beer so you're on your own. Just walk around and look at tap handles and do your own research. Nothing too impressive.  As for food, meh. Stick to pub fare - wings, burgers - and it probably won't suck. Order the ribeye here and... well, you deserve it (my co-worker ate 1/3 of his and discarded the rest.)  Beer (and better food) lovers, find Duckworth's.

Today was just to much. First I didn't get served for about ten minutes after being seated. Next I put my order in and was very surprised by how fast it came out. I tasted one of my wings and found out why. I order six wings GRILLED with honey buffalo sauce. These were fried with hot sauce. I send it back and have to wait again. They finally come out and the chicken is right, not great but it will do. I eat the wings and am ready for the veggies. Grab a carrot and it looks like they just pulled it out of the ground! I would not recommend this place. It seems lately any chain restaurant just doesn't care about service and it's a crapshoot to see what you will get. Definitely the last trip for me!   I came back because I'm an idiot. Today they treated me to raw wings super slow service and the wrong sauce!! I took back a star for this one but hey at least I got a free iced tea out of it!",

    "text": "I went here for the first time with one of my friends not too far back. Honestly the food wasn't bad; I enjoyed my po' boy wrap, not enough to order it again tho. I also liked the atmosphere. They made one huge mistake without realizing it-they sat my friend and I, who are two trained culinary arts students, at seats directly pointing into the kitchen. Bad choice on their part. I can't list all the violations my friend and I witnessed. I'm guessing what were employees off of work (they were wearing street cloths) were going back to the kitchen to grab sauces and clean their cups. Here's a few other things noticed: Server Eating wings in the kitchen Open drinks in kitchen Waiter sat down and talked to an friend instead of serving us-she was nice and all, but that's doesn't excuse that behavior. The Cherry on top of the cake was when my friend ordered a brownie With ice cream. We waited for around 10 minutes for it to come out, and when we saw the man behind the counter put it up for the waiter to grab, she was sitting down and talking to someone. She left it there for about 10 minutes until she got up and went back to the kitchen to grab it. The whole time we were watching as the whipped cream slowly melting into a puddle. We heard her say to the man behind the counter\"Can you put more whip cream on this\" Which he did to cover up all the melted whipped cream in the bowl. When it came to us it was a soupy mess; being at sat under a hot lamp for 10 minutes. That was the last straw really. Thankfully the manager came by and we told her some of the issues to which she offered my friend a discount for his trouble. I'll never go back to this location. Too many good restaurants in Charlotte to waist my time and money here.",

I am in Charlotte on business, and the Carolina Ale House is a block up from my hotel.  I came in ordered wings to go paid and told the bartender I would be back.  I needed to go up the street to CVS and would return and pick up my order.    I paid in advance so he would know I was coming back.  He told me it should take no more than fifteen minutes for my order to be ready.  Cool! I left and headed up the street to The Epicenter to grab a few things from CVS and see what it offer for future dining choices.  Twenty-five minutes later, return, and my order is not ready.  It upset me because the restaurant was far from being at capacity.    Let me put this in context. When I ordered my food, the pre-game show for the Raptors-Bucks game 5 of the NBA playoffs was still on. When I finally received my order, the game was in the second quarter. I received no napkins or utensils.  There were too many people working for the service to be that bad.  The food was good as expected, but the service must improve.",

Can you not clean the place? Can you not hire/find friendly servers or bartenders? Unreal. What a shame for such a cool downtown city. Stay away. Too many choices here in CLT.",

I will preface this review by saying we did express our thoughts in house. Our server did everything he could to pick up his teammates slack. He was the one shining star in this location.   Maybe we are spoiled by the Raleigh location? I'm not sure. But we were disappointed with how we we are treated. On game day, we know we're going to have to wait! And we're enjoying our friends company & completely okay with that.   Our concerns lie with the over all service aspect of our stay. I will say the girls in the group we're taken care of however our husbands and boyfriends were treated as if they were criminals. The host was less than a host. To be exact this was a hugeeeee turnoff & several groups left.   Food order came out cold but because the manager and hosts were so combative & we were so hungry we ate it. Choose your battles I guess ?  Still #KeepPounding",

I ate one of my friends wings and it was really good. I sat in a small area closest to the entrance. It seemed as a whole this venue is pretty narrow but it being uptown I can see why this location may be smaller. I paid $10 for parking which I hate having to do in addition to my meal. They may validate parking, I am not sure because I didn't ask. I also had a lemon drop martini which was very strong. I like subtle and strong drinks so this one was ok for me. There's lots of tvs and hightop tables food for groups who want to watch sports.",

My tuna was also cold. I personally don't think it is was cooked all the way (tho' I know it's suppose to be pink in the inside and the VERY pink) because I ended up getting sick.   Location: was perfect right across the street from the Epic. The light rail train and the Spectrum center are right behind the restaurant. Also walking distance from the Bank of America Stadium. I actually walked from the stadium.   Inside and Decor: TVs everywhere. It's the Pub feel. I LOVE THE TELEPHONE BOOTH!! They have a patio I think they said it close at 9PM. If they would have it open a little longer it will help with the wait ESPECIALLY after any sports events.",

    "text": "What a difference the location makes. I usualky go to Carolina Ale in Waverly. My family and friends were in Uptown for Speed Street so we decise to grab a bite to eat while up there since we had already paid for parking. We didnt have to wait np more that 10 minutes on Saturday evening around 7ish. I noticed people who arrived 15-20 minute after us had to wait an hour to be seated. After being seated, in the restaurant that didnt appear to be anymore crowded tonight that it would be on any other weekend. We had our drink orders taken and from there service was a crapshoot. We ordered and appetizer for our table, the waiter came back 15-20 mins later to take our food orders. Before i speak about the food, we ordered drinks. One person drink was brought to the table and we were able to catch the waiter after another 15 mins or so to ask for the other drinks. We finally placed our food order after being there for atleast 30-45 mins and we were literally receiving our for after being at our table 1 hour and 20 mins later.  I went with the safe bet,  wings and fries extra ceispy. Garlic Parmesan is always a hit!!! Negative, my fries were cold and my wings were nland and as so so as so so can get. They were not fired crispy at all. Of course i wasnt pleased about them but what could you do when knowing it'll take another hour to get a replacement. I finished maybe 5 or 6 out of 12 wings. I was disappointed, especially with out of town guest also dinning. My wife enjoyed her short ribs, my brother in law enjoyed his tacos and our friend enjoyed her wings. My expectations were that of the Waverly location which im assuming was a little too high now. Usually if the food sucks but the service is good, you cant complain to anyone who would listen. This visit, was all around disappointing. The front desk hostess was good! The only thing that was good, was the NBA ECF game was on.",

I a mainly hesitated because this location is so bad, there is no way that any management will even look at these reviews, or do anything to fix all of their problems (You will understand if you actually are daring and go in)  I went in later in the evening after attending a concert (I learned it was about an hour till close)  I asked my bartender Jordan if the kitchen was still open.  He said \"yep, no problem\"  He walked away without asking for my drink order which was odd, as the place was dead?  He then walked by a few more times with no check in?  I then asked him as he was walking away.. \"Hey man, can I get a Stella please?\"  As he walked away with his back to me he raised his finger like \"hold on\".  He finally comes back with the Stella.  Doesn't ask if I want any food, even tho I asked if the kitchen was open and clearly was interesed in an appetizer or whatever.  I finally get the chance to put an order in, and for whatever reason he says the kitchen cant make that at this hour and then walks away!  I totally get the kitchen not being able to make something at a late hour- I have ZERO problem with that.  It was the arrogant, pathetic attitude of my boy Jordan!  He was the worst bartender I have ever encounter in years.  As a new resident to Charlotte who live minutes away, I was excited about finding a new place to watch sports, etc.  I will NEVER be back.  Place was also dirty, floors sticky and bathrooms also.  Clearly nobody cares here.  I can deal pretty well with food issues and even a slightly dirty place for a bar... but rude, arrogant attitude will not fly with me.  Too many great places to choose from in this awesome city.  Good luck guys!",

    "text": "This is my first ever review for Yelp, and my first and last visit to Carolina Ale House. I have never been so fed up with a place enough to write a review before, but here we are.  So I work in the Bank of America plaza where Ale House is located and called in at 12:11pm to place an order for me and my boyfriend, who was at home recovering from surgery. I figured this would give them ample time to get the order ready for me to pick up when I took my break at 12:30.   My order was simple:   1. One cheeseburger, plain, add bacon. A cup of chili subbed as the side. 2. An order of the cheese curds appetizer.  When I first called, a gentleman picked up who got my first name, last initial (?), and phone number. He asked me for my order and I told him a plain cheeseburger with just cheese and bacon, and started to tell him a cup of chili for my side, but he interrupted me and asked if he could place me on hold. After a few minutes, a woman picked up and asked me what I needed. I guess the dude didn't write anything down because she then asked me for all of my contact information, again, and to repeat my order. She said it would be an upcharge for the chili and I told her that wasn't a problem. She said the order would be ready in about 15 minutes. Perfect, just in time for me to take my break.  (I should mention that both employees taking my order pushed hard for their online ordering option multiple times, as if they couldn't be bothered to talk to people on the phone. I told them both that my order was simple and it was easier and faster to call in than to order a burger online just to take almost all of the ingredients off).  I walked down right at 12:30 and went to the bar. I told the bartender that I should have an order ready and gave her my name. A dumbfounded look struck her face before she realized that the ticket was still on the table. She then says \"The guy writing this one was a little confused. You wanted no side?\" I told her my order again and asked if there was another order taken by a woman because that would be the more accurate ticket and maybe it got put in in lieu of the ticket in her hand. She had no idea what I was talking about. She then put in my ticket to be made. Instead of calling me to clarify my order or anything, they just waited until I was ready to pick it up before they my even put it in.  20 minutes later, I finally get my food and start to head home. I open my boyfriend's order while I was stopped at a stoplight to check if everything looked right and literally laughed at what they gave us as the \"side\" of chili. If I had known that they were going to upcharge me for a container the size smaller than my palm, I would've kept the fries as the side. The burger looked okay at first glance, so I give my boyfriend the box when I get home.  Then he checks the burger.  Pickles (which he DETESTS), lettuce, and tomatoes were hidden under the bed of bacon (at least they got that right). He had to eat the burger without a bottom bun because the pickles had soaked through the bun.  This was the worst experience I've ever had with a simple takeout order. How hard is it to get a plain cheeseburger with bacon right?!   Save your money, time, and sanity, and don't ever eat here. Their customer service is a joke.",

Our server was Laporsha R. She was very sweet and attentive. The manager also stopped by our table to ask if everything was ok. Restaurant and restrooms were clean. Price was very reasonable.

    "text": "Actually a pleasant surprise.  I didn't expect a sports bar type place in the southeast to have a gluten-free menu, but they did. Not only did they have it, but it had options for appetizers and entrees.   So, the quick review... Gluten-free: Yes, they offer it and yes, most of the people working there that I encountered understood what that meant. (I say \"most\" since I did get a Caesar salad with my meal that had croutons on it. It was probably a confused order in the kitchen, but salads are easy to spot. Had that been other dish where the sauce or something is less obvious, that could have caused a problem.)  Service: Friendly, fast, responsible.   Food: Pretty typical sports-bar food. Nothing great, but not bad either. If you're at a sports bar, you're there to drink beer and watch TV. The food is background and the portions are appropriately large to make sure everyone gets full.   Beer: I mentioned this separately because one thing for sure that you don't expect at a place like this is a gluten-free beer selection. You expect the \"sorry, but we have hard liquor,\" or \"we have cider.\" This place actually has a gluten-free beer section that's separate from ciders, but let's face it, cider is NOT beer. Now, the downside to this is that the Estrella Damm Daura they put here isn't really gluten-free for celiacs. It will work if you're gluten-free for stylistic or lifestyle reasons, but celiacs will definitely get a negative reaction from this brew. (Not necessarily Carolina Ale House's fault since Estrella still advertises its product as gluten-free,  even though the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) will not let them put the gluten-free label on their beer.)  Still, Carolina Ale House tries to accommodate, and if anything, they should asterisk the Estrella so that the celiacs vs. the lifestyle GFs can make the best decisions.",

It's located on the corner of College and 4th street and boasts plenty of outside dining which I'm sure is popular when the weather is nice. Even though there are TVs everywhere inside and it was crowded, it didn't seem as loud as I thought it would be.   I ordered a pound cake bomb ($6.50) which is a Blue Moon and a shot of vanilla vodka and Bailey's to drop into the Blue Moon. And it was really good. I also had the Velvet Revolver ($6.50) and that was good too, but I liked the pound cake bomb better. It tasted like a dessert and I had no problem shooting it.   For food, I ordered the Picky Platter ($9.99) and an order of dry rub chicken wings (10 for $8.29). The picky platter came with fried pickles, mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and chicken tenders. I liked the fried pickles and the chicken wings and the rest were just average with the mozzarella sticks being my least favorite. The platter came with a side of ranch and marinara sauce for dipping. I think the price was really good considering how much you get. You're at a bar so I'm pretty sure you're not expecting gourmet stuff so I would suggest this as something to munch on to help soak up the alcohol.   The dry rub chicken wings were suggested on yelp and they did not disappoint. By the time I ate the food, I was already two drinks in on a stomach that only had raw juice all day (I guess I blew my diet here :/ I needed a drink!) so I don't really have the words to describe the food, so sorry about that. lol. I just know what I liked and what was just okay and that next time I would just order the dry rub wings and the fried pickles.  I consider the service as decent since we were able to get what we wanted, when we wanted but I know that some of our friends couldn't find their waitress at times and ended up having to go up to the bar to order. Other than that, it was a typical happy hour bar experience. I'd return but only after trying some of the other bars in Uptown.  Photos posted: Picky Platter",

Various football games were playing on their numerous TVs. I certainly would go back for when thirsty for a beer and would like to try some their food.",

    "text": "This place is between three and four stars, initially when they opened the service was poor and the food was good. Now that it has been open a while and I have been there a few times I can say that the service and food are both good, neither is exceptional but both are very acceptable.  The restaurant is clean location is good and the price is what you expect at a nice casual restaurant in uptown. I usually get the grilled chicken tenders with very s sauces. This dish is pretty easy to make and they have delivered a good product each time, the sauces are fine although not different enough to make them interesting. The side salad portion is large for a side salad and the salad ingredients are fresh. Have not tried any of their phone beers but I do see that they have a seasonal collection . I will note that the grilled chicken tenders are probably not grill they are probably done on a flat top otherwise there is no reason for them to be greasy but I can usually plot of the excess greece with a napkin . I have had the fish tacos a couple of times also and would recommend those if you are looking for something on the lighter side.",

Definitely has potential to be a great place to watch a game.  I will be going back soon just for that reason.  I got a cup of chili, just so I could try it and it was above average.  I really like a good  chili :) I ended up getting some type of  turkey avocado wrap for my lunch and it was decent.  This is not a classy play, but it is nice and it seems to be above average bar food.  My friend got the turkey club pita and that also looked very decent.  They are in the process of building the outdoor patio, so that will just add to possibilities.",

    "text": "Generic food, not bad, but nothing to write home about. But what was bad was the service. Our server didn't write things down, and forgot my appetizer. Then when all our food arrived a friend with me mentioned to him that he didn't bring our appetizer. His response was \"Its about to come out\" (This was when all our food was at the table and he was checking if there was anything else we needed). I then said, \"Well I don't want it now I wanted it as an appetizer.\" He then proceeded to say \"All I heard was a burger and bleu cheese chips\". So I got the impression that he was then just lying to my face in order to cover up his mistake of completely forgetting about it, and then even further, placing blame on me that he didn't understand I wanted something from the appetizer menu as an appetizer. It then took probably 20 minutes to get our checks, and my friends had the wrong price on their check for their beer which took another 20 minutes. Even if I didn't live out of state I wouldn't come back to this place.",

We tried both the buffalo-style and dry rub wings. The buffalo wings were very standard bordering on sub-standard with the sauce being too vinegary with little heat. The dry-rub wings were fantastic. Grilled rather than fried with a smoky flavor. We ended up coming back later in the evening just to order another dozen. The service and attitude were for the most part terrible. Our server for the first visit was very slow and imattentive. I ended up asking a passing server for a plate and silverware. Our second visit was a study in bad service. We were told there was a 25 minute wait despite there being at least a dozen empty tables. We decided to wait in the crowded bar area and any time we sat at an empty table just to get out of the way we were immediately chastised by either a server or the hostess. Explaining that we were not trying to steal the table but rather just trying clear the aisles fell on deaf and rude ears. The ironic part was when we finally were seated we didnt see a server for TWENTY minutes. We had to go complain to the same rude hostess before we got any service. Not worth the hassle for me. I wont be back.",

They were really accommodating with my order (no croutons on the salad, double veggies, no potatoes or bread).  I was expecting a limp pile of sauteed squash, carrots, and broccoli, but to my surprise it was a delicious pile of crisp green beans, carrots, onions, red peppers, and a few squash dashed in there.  Very nice.  One of my co-workers got the CAH Pub Burger, and it looked scrumptious (all hail the onion straw).  I would definitely come here again for lunch!",

Huge downstairs bar and upstairs seating.  The bar has a Hickory Tavern feel, not pretentious, just a laid-back cozy bar.  We had the calamari (lightly breaded), wing platter (very big, not scrawny) and the fried pickles (everything you would expect!).    The waiter was constantly checking on us and didnt miss a beat.  Some of us got dinner there, on the higher end of bar food all in all.  The manager stopped by and joked around with us and was very friendly.    I love that the music isnt too loud here like at Mortimers.  At Mortimers you have to yell to your friends even though they are sitting in front of you, but here the music (all 90's hits last night!) was just loud enough to hear it but not overwhelming.  What a great addition to uptown!  :-D",

I was there for an after work function recently and it looked like it was getting a decent crowd so I suspect this place to do pretty well if they can keep the people happy with good service.  Typical bar food fare and also some daily specials that just can't be beat.  For instance, Wednesday is $3.00 pint night....YES PLEASE!  I like it!    We had a table of about 7-8 people and the server kept up really well considering the amount of ordering going on so kudos for that.  The interiors are a little ho-hum for my taste with typical oak cabinetry and millwork trim.  Nothing wrong with that every once in a while but I tend to lean more towards trendy environments.",

Their dining room is decorated with local sports memorabilia and the atmosphere is very chill and definitely sports-like. I've ventured here plenty of times after Bobcats games or as a place to start the night with friends as a jump-off spot. Every server/bartender I have had has been extremely cool, patient and attentive. I actually have not eaten here yet but only because I've always focused on the beer party of the menu. (Duh) They must have a few dozen beers on tap and a cool shot menu that consists of funky bombs and libations to keep you entertained while there.   If you come on a big game night it WILL be busy so attempt to get there early to grab a table or a seat at the bar. Otherwise, there seems to be enough seats to go around  (They also have an upstairs area which I have yet to explore).   If you are tired of the typical Uptown sports bars in Charlotte, walk across 4th street from the Epicentre to try Carolina Ale House. They are the new guy in town with a chain-like appearance but with a Charlotte spot feel.",

The fry to calamari ratio was a little off but the Thai chili dipping sauce was good. I ordered the London broil sandwich and coleslaw. The coleslaw was great - hardly and mayo and good amount of caraway seed. The London broil was shaved thin and rubbed heavily in monterray steak seasoning. It was very tender which was impressive given how thin it was. My partner got the fish tacos which were outstanding. Lightly fried with mango salsa and the slaw. The beer list is impressive and it's a great place to watch any game. I wish I was going to be in town for march madness.",

    "text": "An overcrowded, disappointing sports bar. The only thing going for them is the location. Food is typical fast bar food - fried everything. Service, especially at the bar, is virtually non-existent. And I don't say that because it can get busy during games; I've been there when there are just as much staff as there are customers and couldn't get a drink.  Perfect example, this evening. While I unfortunately agreed to meet someone there, I was very early. I thought I'd grab a drink at the bar. I thought wrong. I sat at the bar, saw 4 different employees behind the bar, and couldn't get a drink if I jumped up on the bar and did the truffle shuffle. I noticed other patrons trying to get their attention: another drink, pay the bill, etc. It appeared they were all frustrated as well. I left to grab a drink at Fleming's next door instead.",

We were fine with waiting and decided to grab a couple drinks at the bar  None of the bartenders came over to check if we needed anything despite being called several times. A waitress came over to ask us if we needed anything told her what we wanted and she went to tell a bartender. Said bartender listened to her telling what we wanted and then went back to doing other work completely ignoring us and our drinks.  Finally, an hour later even though we were told originally was going to be half an hour wait, they came back to us saying it would be another hour for our table.  They didn't offer any discounts for waiting, any comped appetizer, drinks, nothing. They didn't even try to ask other patrons that had been sitting there to leave for other patrons that have been waiting for a table  Without a doubt, worst dining experience I've had",

    "text": "New management?  New take on classic items like Chicken Nachos? By far, the worst nachos I have ever eaten- anywhere. Sad thing is, not too long ago CAH had some of the best nachos I have ever eaten.  First thing you notice is the serving size is smaller, ok no problem. But, the nachos came out in a dirty pan (and not dirty because the current meal was messy).  Most disturbing was the \"chicken.\" It was difficult to determine if it was chicken or pork, the very small amount of meat was not recognizable (visually, or by palate). Maybe, if there were more meat, we would've been able to discern. We even asked the waitress to confirm it was chicken, she said because it was dark meat chicken, people often could not tell if it was chicken or pork. I have never had a problem differentiating pork from chicken. But, I digress.  They also add this queso-like spicy cheese to the nachos, which must come in a squeeze bottle because it covered everything- I think what CAH is hoping is that that new sauce hides the fact they haven't really put any meat on it. I asked the waitress if it was new sauce, she had no clue as she'd only worked there for a couple of months.   I ended up just taking a to-go tray, because I had to leave. But, those \"nachos\" should have been sent back to the kitchen and destroyed. Now, they're at the edge of my desk waiting to be thrown away!  CAH takes for granted that they are in a prime location and people are always coming in. For the folks that work and live over here, it is likely we will not return.",

I didn't have a smart phone yet, can you believe that?! So we ended up here. Though it brings back pleasant memories and definitely serves a purpose, as a food lover I don't go out of my way to eat here. The food is decent, I don't have anything bad to say about it, and the beer selection is large but overall this is just your average sports bar food. There are a ton of tv's and service at the bar is excellent so if you're looking for a spot to watch the game and aren't overly concerned about top-notch food then this place is just that.   We ended up there again because we were meeting a group who was in town for the Panther's game for a late dinner and looking for something convenient (that served plenty of beer) within a short walk from their hotel. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and drinks and the service really was excellent. We started with the appetizer platter, fricles (fried pickles), and sweet potato fries. I had the buffalo shrimp salad, and again not bad but not that good either.   If your goals are beer and a lot of tv's then this spot will be for you.",

That's if a hop, skip and a throw equates to a block.   Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3.5/5 80% Sports Bar. 20% Family Restaurant. The crowd is usually a medium size group of friends having dinner and drinks and not a group of die-hard sport fans. There's a good amount of televisions but there could be more. If the Panthers are playing you'll have to maneuver around to find a table near the lonely screen showing any other games.   Cleanliness: 4/5 There weren't any glaring problems but you should expect a level of quality equal to a chain restaurant.  Service: 3.5/5 Waitress was engaged but seemed like a bit of a salesmen trying to talk us into more rounds and food. Another table's bill was brought to us as well but it was an honest mistake to make given that the establishment was packed.   Booze: 5/5 A wide assortment of beers from all over the nation. It sucked that both our first choices were out so we had to go with the Sam Adams Oktoberfest. I was pretty disappointed because I had not seen Golden Monkey any where else in Charlotte.

Food was average. The only thing worth trying for us were the sweet potato fries. I had the California dipper - beef brisket sandwich with dipping juice. Sooooo salty and the brisket was not the best. I don't recommend. The sandwich needed some slaw to counter the high sodium. My fiance had the wings and fries. Wings were average. Not the best we've had. But you can request different flavors and the food was a decent price.   For sports vibe, it's pretty good.

My salad showed up a few minutes later with a message that they have no meatloaf left and I had to choose something else.  Now I have a salad and have to pick another entree.  I went with the fish n chips which ended up a major mistake.  I should have known things weren't right when they literally showed up before I was half done with my salad.  The fish coating was greasy and soggy and the fries were undercooked to the point where they still had a slight crunch to them.  The tarter sauce was basically only mayo.  I tried to scrape off the breading of the fish and just eat the inside but even the fish wasnt good so I ended up giving it back.    They did end up taking it off my bill after I requested it but I don't recommend this dish.  I also suggest to the restaurant that if you are out of a dish please don't bring part of the meal to me then tell me what I ordered is not available.  Interestingly enough the first review on another site also mentioned a \"disgusting\" experience with the fish n chips.",

When we got there, nobody seemed to know about the reservation.  Everyone ended up sitting outside.  We had approximately  25 people in the party and ONE main server.   She was running crazy but was very pleasant.  Had to ask multiple times for refills. However, food was good.    Second visit of the week.  Party of 10 this time.  Once again, sat ouside.  Once again, ONE main server. Appetizers took forever.  Half of party received main entree and were finished eating before other half of party received their meal. Again, food quality was good.  Service, very slow.    My bottom line opinion, the people working here seem to have very pleasant attitudes....work very hard...but they are just spread too thin. More servers are need on a consistent basis. Period.",

I got my food in a to go box since I was sure how much time I had and wanted to save her the trouble. Even the person who brought me the to go box was so nice and the other bartenders were on point. As a business owner and former bartender and restaurant and club manager, I would say this is the best Carolina ale house I've ever been to.",

The nachos were missing sour cream and guac plus the cheese was cold and that was just the appetizer. My salmon Caesar salad was extremely short on lettuce but luckily the salmon was a decent size. My girlfriend ordered a veggie burger pub style and they added bacon.... Seriously it's a veggie burger why would they add bacon! I assume these issues arrived due to the fact the initial server didn't write anything down. After we placed our orders the server got into an argument with another server and went home. Luckily Steven took care of us and tried to do his best to fix what he kitchen and initial server messed up.  With all this it makes me question the quality of the  management. If there is an issue meet the table and resolve it and make sure the table is happy.",

The chips were good, I thought. My other complaint is the they had like 50 (exaggeration) bartenders behind the bar, however, not once anyone stopped to ask if we needed anything. We had to flag them down and one bartender even told us to \"hang on\" when we finally got his attention.   Just a typical sports bar. Nothing special.",

    "text": "I tried giving Carolina Ale House a few shots and every time I was disappointed.   The first time I went to CAH was for a Yelp elite event. The event itself was a lot of fun! But I'm just not sure how much CAH had to do with that. It seemed like the staff working it for us were kind of oblivious to what was going on. I will say though, the marketing guy (I think that's who it was) that was there represented CAH really well. He definitely did a nice job telling us all about the restaurant and it's amenities.   The second time I came here was on a Friday night, so it was kind of busy but nothing out of the norm. Our waitress was not very friendly or attentive. We ordered our food once our friends arrived and boy were we in for a serious wait. It took about an hour for 3 salads and a soup to come out. And when those did finally come out, my boyfriends meal was still no where to be seen. 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes later still had not got his meal and our waitress had still not come to our table to see how our food was or if we needed anything! She finally came and we told her about the missing meal. About 10 more minutes later, a manager I assume came over and apologized giving my bf his meal. By this time we had been long done and he didn't want it anymore. They insisted they bag it up and we take it home, so we did but obviously we, especially my boyfriend, was less than pleased and hungry!   The third time we came to CAH was on a Saturday around 3. A pretty random time to be eating so it was not busy at all! Again our waitress was not very nice nor was she attentive. The food this time was pretty good and the service was fast, but too fast!! We felt rushed the whole time and unwelcome. Our wing appetizer came out quickly and we barely got two bites in when our meals came out, which isn't the worse thing that can happen but makes it a little less enjoyable. We had been eating now about 10 minutes when the waitress came over and asked how everything was followed by asking if we wanted any dessert. I still had pretty much my whole meal on my plate as did my boyfriend. We had only been eating for about 10 minutes and again felt rushed. A few minutes later she came back and dropped off the check, with our plates still full! I couldn't believe it, I'd never seen something like it even with working in the service industry for about 8 years. We paid and I asked for a to-go box which not surprisingly never showed up, even though the waitress walked by 2 more times.   It's safe to say I probably won't be returning anytime soon.",

The place in it of itself is a mecca for sports watching - great tvs at every angle and it is super clean and I have only experienced super friendly service.  The food is bar food... and pretty good bar food at that. I had the chicken tenders and the salads... solid choices... nothing to write home to mom about about solid.

Their signature cocktail, the Panther Prowl, was deliciously tangy and fruity! I would recommend the food to all of my friends, so why would I give only three stars? When we were finally seated after about a 45 minute wait (which I assume is standard after a Panthers game), we had to wait an additional FIFTEEN MINUTES before we finally resorted to flagging someone down to take our drink orders. We were passed by waiters probably 20 times in that time-frame, some who gave us the ol' side eye. Fifteen minutes. That is just unacceptable! The waiter we finally managed to flag down wasn't even working our part of the section, but he took our orders anyway (which was great since we were on the verge of eating our menus). Ordinarily in this situation, having worked at a few restaurants myself, you would expect some sort of discount or some sort of acknowledgment, none of which we got. My boyfriend was conflicted about leaving only $8 on a $76 bill because our waiter took our orders outside of his section, but the fact that we waited so long just for an initial order was just awful. Go for the food, but don't expect anywhere near quick/good service.",

Nothing really stands out as unique but the menu is A-OK.  I've had the wings (B-) and the chicken bbq sandwich (B+) and the fried pickles (C).  The pickles are better at other places but nothing can really beat this location (right next to the Epicentre) and the space.  Something about not being cramped when its crowded is rather nice.  It is a great place to meet up after work or watch the Bobcats/Panthers.  Honestly, you can't go wrong here.. You will leave happy.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

They weren't even busy... just all working in slow motion it seemed... they had about 10 other people including us waiting at the bar including us and not one bartender could get to us! We ended up leaving along with a few others. If you're going to have bartenders on at a busy location on a busy night.. make sure they know what they're doing !",

I had the grilled salmon salad, but the salmon was overcooked in my opinion. It tasted dry, and lost a lot of the freshness that is so critical to a good piece of salmon  It would be a good place to hangout or watch the game for sure, but not to go and have dinner.",

Large portion. Deep fried cheese curds are amazing.  The best part though is the amazing staff. Darrian and Kaytea have impeccable service and are some of the most kind servers I've ever seen.  The bartender Chubbs made some awesome drinks and was super friendly. The management checked often to make sure everything was great.  This place was such a good time we came back 4 days in a row. In fact I never Yelp anything, and the service, food and just the people made it so that I had to write a review!",

    "text": "Good food, good drinks, good service, great location!  Went for dinner and drinks with my boyfriend here on a Wednesday afternoon. They're building a patio, so there's construction. That didn't interfere with the inside though.   The waitress knew the menu INSIDE & OUT! She said she's tried everything on the menu for 2 things. She suggested I try the Carolina Berry Vodka Sour Martini, and I say it is a MUST TRY!  For starters my boyfriend had a ceasar salad, while I tried the spinach dip with nachos & pita bread. Oh-my, let me tell you the pita bread was the PERFECT side for the dip! It was warm and had a buttery taste to it, I was instantly addicted!  My boyfriend wanted ribs, but they weren't going to be available until dinner time, so he ordered Crispy Southern Chicken Sandwich, which came with 2 tiny chicken pieces on each roll. My boyfriend said it was ok because he hates bothering the waiter, but he is 6'3 and 235, and that was not going to fill him up. I asked the waiter if he could have more chicken on his sandwich, and they brought it out with no problem and no charge!  I opted for a cheesburger with chili, bbq, lettuce, and mustard. I loved it! The chili was so-so, but the burger itself was juicy, and delicious!  We ended the dinner with a shot which topped off our experience!  Will I go back to Carolina Ale House? Of course! And you should too!",

    "text": "Worst customer service EVER and here is why....First I must start by stating, I grew up waiting tables and bartending to pay for college so I am extremely patient when it comes to being in the weeds but this place was off the charts.....So we are from out of town and thought we would try something new and different. We arrived around 12:30 and it was typical lunch hour rush however they seemed to be unusually under staffed for the lunch hour. We sat at the bar because when we arrived there were several people waiting at the host stand and no hostess or manager greeting people and/or taking names so we sat at the bar, knowing from expierence that bartenders are usually the most tenured, however we sat for 10 minutes without even so much as a smile, acknowledgement (eye contact) or hello. So we continued to wait patiently as we see 2 different bartenders pour beer and a food runner (maybe waiter in training, certainly not a manager in training) pass us without making eye contact.  When we finally decided to ask one of the 3 women that we saw behind the bar, we asked the woman that was running food, if she could take our order (because we were hungry and had limited time for lunch) stated to us, \"I am not your server or a server\" we could not hear her clearly because she mutter the words as she continued to walk by us instead of stopping to speak with us and explain that she may not be the server or bartender but \"I will take your order or get you somebody that can\" i.e. it's called customer service. In my opinion, if the bartenders can't handle their own bar, they should not be behind the bar and if the woman that was running food is in training for any position in the restaurant she needs to a little crash course in customer service. When I brought it to the on duty managers attention, he seemed a little overwhelmed and could only apologize instead of making it right.",

First, we had the wings.  They were extremely tasty, until we bit into and under cooked one(in there defense the wing was abnormally large and the rest of the wings were cooked to perfection). No big deal! They were taken off the bill! I then got the salmon, I ordered it medium.  It was very dry and lacked flavor, upon the first bite.  I had taken the salmon meal to go, by the time I got back and realized the quality of the food, the restaurant was closed! Go back the next day and I exchange the salmon for ribs.  After all, they are known for there bbq and the sauce on the wings was delicious.  I inform the manager and let him know that I will be driving 20 minutes to come exchange the food. They do not offer me a refund and I get the food and ribs are dry and slightly burnt.  The beans were a tad better than the night before. Still not good quality of food. I'm surprised because the location is great! Its a shame because the wings, I may consider going back for!",

    "text": "I went by there to watch a Panthers game and the whole experience was pretty sub-par. For one, the area we were seated in was right below some speakers and they had the cranked up to 11 and we just about had to yell constantly to have conversation. It was kinda interesting in a way because after a while people just kinda subconsciously gave up on conversation and by the end of the evening a few of us were just sitting there quietly. Anyways, along with our drinks we ordered a pretty good assortment of \"bar\" type food. Sandwiches, wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, french fries, nachos and even pizza. I sampled a little bit of everything just about since we were all doing a communal snacking type deal and I think the only thing that was even borderline decent was the mini chicken tenders. The nachos had some kind of cheese whiz type sauce which tasted like it was from a jar. I think they brought us 6 or so mozzarella sticks and at least two of them didn't even have any cheese in them. The fried pickles were the soggiest incarnation I've ever tasted and the both the pizza and chicken sandwich were greasy. Overall it was just a crummy meal. They do seem to have a very good drink selection though and a full bar even though the drinks are a little overpriced. If I could say one good thing about the place it is that the wait staff seemed very friendly and was on top of their game. Our server didn't mess anything up and kept all our drinks filled. Another funny note was that the guys running the food to the tables seemed to be clueless as can be. Not only did we get our food but they tried at least 3 additional times to bring us other peoples orders. It's like they had no idea where they were supposed to take the orders.",

My first night there we stayed downstairs at the bar. Every game we wanted to see was on (baseball and football) and there was definitely a great energy level. The main issue was halfway down the bar some patrons were smashing dishes at what started out as baseball errors (or so we were told by a bartender) and then escalated to whenever they felt like smashing a glass into the well of the bar. I'm not really sure why the bar staff was putting up with the constant glass shrapnel (followed by the need to sweep) especially since a few were almost hit themselves, but it went on the whole time we were there. Also, the drinks seemed fairly weak and overly sweet (even a switch to a diet mixer didn't help) luckily, they have lots of beer!  My second visit we sat upstairs and it started out quieter, but as the evening progressed it definitely picked up. (I loved the TVs mounted on the support beams right next to the table.) We had some problems accessing the wireless and after thirty minutes of \"try this password, okay well then try this password\" the manager finally apologized, said the system must be down, and that he'd cover our beers for the trouble. Completely unnecessary, but we were happy with the offer, ordered some food, and continued to watch the games. After noshing a bit we decided to play a game of pool (maybe 15 feet from our table), and amidst the game looked up to find that our table was being cleared (although we had left some personal items, some food we were still snacking on, and drinks) and a new party was being sat down at it. Our server caught it too late, post unnecessary tongue lashing from the hostess for not clearing her own table. Again we received apologies and a promise to cover a round, and we continued to play pool. Eventually when we decided to close out (after it took forever to find our server as she had so many tables) we find out nothing was comped and I'm still fairly certain we were charged for an extra beer we didn't even order. That being said we just wanted to get out of the place and move on with our evening, so we paid and left.   There are places I'd visit before returning to the ale house again, but with its TVs, beer selection, and decent specials, I'm sure I'll find myself there again... I just won't be expecting much.",

My expectations were already set low when a friend warned me that the food she ate had not been that great at the other locations- but I never imagined it could be so bad.

Even the three times another waiter came by to double check what was missing and they still got it incorrect! Not sure who is at fault for this when you realize your waitress is the only bartender and server upstairs on a Monday night- but then again she didnt write anything down either. A manager thought it would be good customer service to practically beg us to take other food from the kitchen but frankly we had all lost our appetite at that point. There are many sports bars in Charlotte and I'd rather go to one that has good food, great service and they dont charge you for the food that they messed up on or forgot to bring you.",
