It's hard to compare these to the various hibachi places around town, because this is a favorite category of mine anyway.  The group atmosphere is a must with friends, and the Saki waterfall is a competition among good friends.  If the other grill spots were closer, I'm not sure I would still stop coming to Red Ginger, however the others would get a fair share of my presence.  This one is the closest to me, but I'll still drive for the others away from uptown.",

The Chef did not meet the expectations of entertaining with the onion volcano or flipping shrimp.  He flipped his spatula at the beginning but that was about it.  The quality of the food was just OK.  I didn't event want a togo box to take my leftovers.  No one in my family was impressed and no one will be returning.   The cocktails weren't impressive either.  All around I suggest going somewhere else.",

The soup and salad that was served before the meal was also up to par.    My chief complaint about this place is the poor service. Drink orders took twenty minutes to arrive, multiple servers had to come to the table to confirm orders, and the worst part was that the tip was tacked on at the end of the bill. Whether you're satisfied with the service or not, you're not going to escape that mandatory 20% tip.     This was a decent place to eat while I was in the area, but I don't think that I'll come here next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I ate there for the first time on lunch yesterday (9/22/15).  Overall, it was just \"OK\".  The ambiance inside was very very nice, but the food didn't really impress me, especially for the cost.  I had the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Bento box, Served with Miso Soup, Fried Shumai, California Roll, Fried Rice and Seasonal Fruit.  The Shumai was ok.  It didn't have any great flavor to write home about, just basically a fried dumpling.  The Miso soup was fine, but let's be honest, it would be hard to screw up Miso soup.  The California roll was 4 pieces and pretty weak.  I would say the California Rolls you get at Harris teeter are better.  The Fried rice had a good flavor and good chunks of fried egg, so no complaint there.  The Chicken Teriyaki came with snow pea pods.  Overall, it was just \"ok.\"  I know it's not the best description, but I guess that is my point, the flavor was like any other bland Teriyaki chicken you have had a 1,000 times before.  The seasonal fruit was 2 slices or orange.   My wife went with the 3 sushi roll combo.  6 pieces in each roll.  Again, the rolls were not better than what I can find in the grocery store and honestly, one was loaded up with way too much cream cheese, to the point my wife had to take some out.    I ate there because I had a coupon.  But I would say, I doubt I will try it again (not without a much better coupon).",

He kept trying to take our drink and meal orders before our party could even sit down. The restaurant week menu was supposed to include an appetizer, main course and dessert. We did not receive our appetizers until after we had all finished our meals. Our server then got some of our orders wrong.    The hibachi chef had a serious attitude and did not do very much of the entertainment that you would expect at a hibachi restaurant. We thought it was just him, but we watched him put on a fabulous show for the next party at another table. He even had balloon animals for the little girl at that table while my young daughter did not.   When we gave feedback to the manager, just like our server, she kept interrupting and rushing us too!  By the time we got to speak with her, no one even wanted dessert, especially when we were then told that they were out of some of the options. We had to go back and forth with the manager to get any type of remedy.   All in all, the food was really good, but the service was horrible and it seemed they were not prepared for the volume of orders during Restaurant Week. They could also use some training for their staff in customer service.",

On top of that, my waitress messed up our checks more than twice which was very unprofessional even though we told her beforehand how our checks were separated and her comment was \"Yes, this is gonna help me later on. Thank you.\"  Help? I think it made it worse for you sweetheart. The food was average and I'm not saying that because we had a bad experience, overall we weren't as satisfied as I thought. Also, before we were seated we handed them an expensive ice cream cake and by the time they gave it back to us it was melted. They said it was kept in a \"cooler\" but the box was no where near cold. I'm a little confused? I wouldn't recommend coming back again. Neither my friends.",

After being seated near the sushi bar area, I ordered from the lunch menu and got the Hibachi Steak with soup.  Had to make a change with the vegetables that came with it because I'm no fan of broccoli; no problem, I got zucchini and onion for vegetables instead.  The wait time was reasonable and my sweat tea was slightly strong, but fine.  The soup that I was served before the meal had a odd spice yet bland taste.  The Hibachi Steak was served with a good portion of surprisingly tender steak, a good serving of zucchini and onion and a very measured amount of fried rice.  The dish came with two small dishes of dipping sauces (the usual shrimp sauce and brown sauce).  The taste of the dish was good, it was what I would expect for Hibachi style and I eventually cleaned the plate.  I give it four stars.  The service was friendly and was able to make substitutions without issue; the prices were a little higher, but you do get a choice of soup or salad with the meal; and taste was good... not amazing, but it is much better than other Japanese restaurants in Charlotte that focus more on the sake and sushi while the grill suffers.  Overall, worth additional visits.",

I called and gave his sushi order specifying that it had to be on soy paper. When he got back to his office, the order was wrong, they didn't use soy paper. I called and they agreed to fix it. He had to take more time to go back and get it. Not only were they not apologetic for wasting his time, they were borderline rude. Today we gave them another try. I called and placed his to-go order, and stressed that the sushi roll must be on soy paper. I was told the total would be $12.99. $12 plus $.99 in tax. When my husband arrived he double checked and it was made correctly with soy paper.  However, the bill was $19.84! They were charging an additional $6.85 for soy paper! While I have occasionally been charged a dollar extra for sushi this way, I have always been told this IN ADVANCE & have never seen an up-charge this outrageous! My husband started to walk away and they \"compromised\" by only charging him $16, which he paid so it wouldn't have been a total waste of his time...again. And of course, they were rude about the whole situation. The sushi was OK, but nothing special. Don't waste your time here. There are many better quality sushi places around, with good service, that won't try to steal from you. Read the other negative reviews, and instead try Room 112, K.O Sushi, Pisces......pretty much anywhere else!",

I almost feel bad about leaving such a harsh review because the dinner was very good and we throughly enjoyed the chef himself however the waiter ruined the experience for all 8 of us",

I literally cancelled my reservation because I could not get over the treatment I got when I called to reserve a table, she acted like she was doing me a huge favor by accommodating a table for us.  I've been here before and the food is not that great so I can find better hibachi at any other Japanese restaurant where they have more appreciation for clients. I would not spend a penny in this place.",

Perhaps my basis for disregard is the fact of not really being a sushi lover, and thinking that smelly,raw fish \"delicacy, as some call it\" was all to be had there, but boy was I wrong. I had a seat near the sushi bar, and was entertained, as well as educated by the sushi chef as to the various types of sushi, both the raw fish varieties and the multitude of non fish types that could please the palate. I was introduced to several types, spicy blends that tickled my fancy to more \"traditional\" types containing favorites of mine such as multiple types of tuna, to include yellow tail tuna, etc. I was delighted with my experience here and loved this intimate setting that could definitely serve as a great date spot with that someone special (hint, hint fellows). Upon your trying this spot, take the adventurous route and not hide in the shadows, but align your self to the sushi bar and allow yourself the chance to experience the ever changing world of sushi  Save my seat Red Ginger, I'll be back!!!",

    "text": "I wish I could leave a review on the actual food but never even got to the point of having a server.   We got there at 7:40 and asked for seating in the general area (not at the hibachi). We were led to our table across carpet that was so sticky and dirty that it was pulling the shoes off our feet.   There were only two other tables seated at the time so it was far from busy. After 15 minutes of no acknowledgement and watching the other two tables being served by the same server, we were becoming frustrated. This was clearly our server and we didn't get as much as a glance in our direction. So I went back to the hostess and asked for a server to at least take a beverage order.   Five minutes later (20 minutes after arriving) we are still sitting with no acknowledgement and another table has been seated behind us. Within two minutes of arriving, this table was greeted with waters by a server. At this point we stood up and left. The hostess just looked and I let her know that it was because we had not been approached yet to which her response was \"oh\".   No table should have to sit for 20 minutes before even being acknowledged. I can understand being short staffed but the restaurant was not busy and watching tables be helped that arrived 20 minutes after us, in our section, was frustrating.   I would love to give the food a chance but couldn't imagine going back to have to walk across that disgusting carpet and not be served.",

We ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer. Wasn't mind blowing, but was still good. The miso soup was also decent along with the salad. They weren't bad, just didn't leave a memorable impression.  My husband ordered the seafood delight I think was its name. His lobster was very tough and initially unidentifiable. I ordered the fillet and shrimp hibachi dinner combo. The fillet was actually really good. Cooked and seasoned well. Unfortunately, my shrimp was way over cooked and way under seasoned. My noodles were a little bland as were my vegetables and fried rice.   Honestly, the place could be a real uptown sensation with just a few improvements in my opinion. Better seasoning and shorter cook times on the seafood. Other than that, it wasn't bad. Service was pretty decent. I couldn't drink any water because my first glass had this white substance stuck to the inside with stuff floating inside it. I asked for another glass and that one was in the same condition.  They gave us a coupon for our next visit. Not sure if I will return",

So much food, I always wind up taking some home for a late night snack or lunch the next day. The bar area is great to watch a game while eating, very large projection screen on wall. The bar tender and waitress have always been kind and friendly to me, even though it takes me a long time to make a decision.

It took our waitress 10 minutes before she came to take our drink order (however she was very attentive to the table next to us while we just sat that) once she got out drink orders it took another 5 minutes to fill those (again lots of attention was given to the other table). After about 20 minutes we were finally able to order our food. When I finished with my soup and salad I put the plates at the end of the table to indicate I was finished. When our sushi came out the waitress just left the dirty dishes on the table. When our food came out she just pushed the empty plates to the side in order to make room for our food. I had to ask her to remove the plates we were finished with. After our food came out she never came back, my husband and I were both low on tea and I was in need of extra shrimp sauce. We had to get her attention (while she was once again at the other table) in order to get our check. Needless to say we will not be going back. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible.",

Our chef was still very funny and didn't all the speciality tricks in an accelerated time and yet the hibachi was still SOOOO GOOD. The sushi on the other hand I got a chefs special roll, I asked the waiter about how big it would be and she told me they were very big when in doubt they were a normal size just more rolls. Even though it was small it was still very good but left me a little hungry which is why I also got the hibachi. A great experience all around would recommend.",

Our waiter, Kacy was fantastic!! She was very nice, patient with us deciding and very attentive with our drinks. She honestly felt like a friend how nice she was. We ordered the combo filet mignon, shrimp and chicken hibachi and gyoza to share. Everything was very good... The shrimp was very overcooked though. Love that they give you noodles and fried rice with your hibachi meal. We had plenty of food to share. Also love that Amelie's is right across the street! I told the manager about how great our waiter was and she brushed it off like she didn't care or want to hear it. Pretty irritating but whatever. You did a great job Kacy!",

Waitress was very friendly came in frequently and checked in with us from time to time. Throughout my time there, waters were refilled without having to asked (which I highly appreciated as I was busy inhaling my entree) However, I think the most enjoyable aspect of the night was our hibachi chef. Very sociable, cracked many jokes, very entertaining as he showed off his skills. Not one dull moment as he cooked, which is different than other hibachi chefs as I have had many experiences where they just showed off their skills but haven't talked to the group and just simply cooked.  THE MEAL What I ordered was the Steak and Salmon. Portion size is respectable. Plate is filled. The taste is amazing. Would come back for their salmon. There was leftover shrimp (he brought too much so he distributed shrimp to all of us) and the shrimp was really fresh. Hibachi entree came with rice, noodles, vegetables, and two protein of choice.",

The hostess was friendly and we were seated outside without issue.  Our server came to our table and took our drink order promptly.  After our drinks were delivered, our sushi dinner order was taken.  We ordered a Godzilla Roll, a Rock and Roll, and an M16 Roll.  A reasonable time later, our sushi was delivered promptly and friendly.  Food quality-wise, the rolls were fantastic!  I tend to think of myself as a sushi aficionado and the rolls we ordered were as described and tasted even better.  The best part of our experience was our server was not over-bearing.  We drank; we ate; we talked; we were never interrupted or pressured by our server.  Visiting Charlotte was a rare occasion but if I ever find myself near Red Ginger again, I would eat there again without hesitation!!!",

Smoke was flowing straight on us to the point we couldn't breathe.  It was two people - one person did NOT eat as the situation was so bad.  The other person did eat some but when speaking to the manager she didn't listen, cut us off and only discounted the bill slightly.  We should've walked out with the dirty plates, our fault.

We were seated at an open hibachi grill and waited about 15 minutes for the rest of the table to fill up, but the waitress was around for drinks which was good. I got a lemon drop martini.  Very delicious and strong.   Everyone at or table ordered the hibachi, but our friends started with sushi which is buy 1 get 1 half off on Saturday. For the hibachi, all the hibachi meals come with mushroom soup, salad, rice, noodles, veggies (carrot, mushroom, broccoli, onion and zucchini and a two piece shrimp appetizer. I loved that we got both options of rice and noodles. You could even opt to get double rice or noodles if you didn't want both. For my meal I got the chicken ($16). It was flavorful and I loved the \"red\" ginger sauce they served with it. Very unique!   Overall, we had a great night at Red Ginger. It's nothing to rave about, but if I'm in the mood for hibachi and the experience I would return.",

    "text": "My annoyance at being forced away from my desk to shuffle down a stairway on a sunny day for a firedrill while trying to run a meeting quickly disappeared when my coworker suggested I drop into Red Ginger to pick up some carryout on my way back into the office, solving both my need for lunch and my hatred of waiting at the elevator bank with 200 of my closest friends also returning from the firedrill.  I've never tried Red Ginger before because it always seemed too sit down/fancy. Half the restaurant is dedicated to hibachi tables Benihana style, another quarter of it is a proper sushi bar, and then there's a regular bar and table seating.  Placed my order for the shrimp hibachi combo, which at $11 included a drink, choice of soup or salad, and the usual veg and rice choices one gets with a hibachi combo. The wait was about ten minutes which passed quickly as a friend was waiting for another mutual friend in the restaurant, so she waved me over to come sit with her at her table while we both waited.  The restaurant was fairly empty at 11:15, but my order came out promptly and as soon as I saw the guy walking from the kitchen with my carryout bag, I started the brief goodbyes with my friends. By the time I'd gotten to the front door, the hostess had my bag and soda in her hands ready to give to me. Highly efficient! As a bonus, the elevator banks had cleared out too.  On to the food: There are two other places in Charlotte that I've mentioned on Yelp doing hibachi style food. The first (and least appealing) is TinTin up north by the Bank of America buildings. The second is Hasaki Grill, a little further south of my office building on the way to the BB&T ballpark. I've written them up on Yelp, their food is good.  So with those for comparison, Red Ginger is in the top 2, nearly tied with, perhaps slightly edging out Hasaki grill for ambiance in the restaurant, and flavorful food. My order came with six shrimp, a slew of rice, \"Yum Yum\" sauce and a brown ginger-based sauce. The salad came with the traditional bright-orange ginger dressing you tend to get at a hibachi restaurant. (I should know, I worked in one for a year in college.)  For me, the real edge here has to be given to the restaurant that's most convenient, which is Red Ginger. It's located right in the base of my office building and I pass that corner every day on my way home from work.  So, while I'm frustrated that I had to quickly cancel my meeting and disrupt my routine for a fire drill, I'm pleasantly full and surely headed for a mild food coma in an hour or so. I'll be keeping Red Ginger on my list for quick, nearby carry-out lunch options.",

Soup and salad came out quick but I can't say the same about our entrees. 10, 20, 30 minutes passed and no food. The table next to us got their food and left before we got anything. About 30 minutes in we see our waitress pull who I'm assuming the manager to the side and then she immediately came to our table. The manager goes on to tell us that at 1:50pm they were JUST THEN starting to make our food. WE WERE ALMOST THE ONLY TABLE THERE. To make matters worse, we said we needed our food to go at the point and our checks so we could get our food and go. This took another 15 minutes. Well after 2pm we finally got our food and a measly 20% off of our order. Let me also add, our waitress (female with some type of facial piercing) could have given 2 about us. Consider training your waitstaff to be a little more responsive instead of staring at us the whole time. We didn't get a single explanation of what happened but all the hype we heard about this place went right out of the door with us. To be honest, it was mediocre Japanese food anyways. Not worth it. I will never be going back here again.",

Beautiful atmosphere, very clean, and the service and food were top notch. We had such a wonderful experience. My husband is a chef so I tend to be a bit picky, but I was beyond impressed with our Hibachi chef, Glenn. He kept us laughing the entire time and of course fed us some amazing food. We also ordered sushi and it exceeded our expectations as well. Highly recommend!",

Watching your food prepared in front of you on a hibachi by a gimmicky chef is entertaining at their age and we wanted to start the evening off with a fun vibe. We were seated right away at the hibachi and collectively ordered the chicken, shrimp and scallop dishes. Our chef arrived and performed the same tableside shtick we have seen dozens of times before. Can these places come up with a new routine by now? Food was good, service was good, prices were reasonable.",

I almost didn't want to come because of only being a 3 stars restaurant but since my husband guaranteed the was really good I accepted the challenge. We got there around 1:15, place was not that busy and were sat right away.  They have a pretty decent menu and also some specials for the day.  The prices are regular prices, I thought it would be expensive but I was wrong.  I got a steak hibachi that comes with an option of soup or salad, however since I couldn't decide I had both.  Ginger dressing for the salad was overwhelming. Miso soup was good but I was not impressed. My steak hibachi was delicious even tho it my steak was a little bit overcooked. The fried rice was good and the veggies very flavorful.  My husband had a chicken hibachi bento box, I tried it and was pretty good.  My mother in law had the same thing as I did and her thoughts about her dish were same as mine.  Service was good, food did not take long to be served and overall the experience was good. Sometimes even when the place has not that many starts you still have to go and check it yourself and and I am glad I did.",

Got there at 9pm and it seemed like things were winding down as it was a week night early in the week but the hostess was very nice and seated my friend and I and took our drink orders which were brought promptly and correctly. We ordered our entrees and the prices seemed very affordable for what you get and you get a lot!! Had the hibachi of course, and there were tons of rice and vegetables, noodles, salad, soup, a shrimp appetizer and the main course, which mine was a filet mignon (perfectly cooked) and scallops (also perfectly cooked and great portions for each) I had to take food home and so did the couple next to us. The chef was awesome and was very entertaining to watch while the food was close to perfect. A great place to take a date or just to have an amazing meal!",

And the broccoli was so little, dehydrated and pitiful. I will never return here. I ordered a chocolate martini that tasted like chlorine. Definitely not happy with this food and it doesn't deserve to be in uptown Charlotte. And then!!! There was so much smoke In the restaurant that my eyes started to burn!

I got to sample some sushi prior to my hibachi and it was very good. Red Ginger does the traditional Miso Soup, Salad with Ginger Dressing or Ranch, Hibaci vegetables, noodles, rice, and meat of your choosing.  The rice was okay, I enjoyed the noodles and the meat the most.  Overall the atmosphere was nice, and the location was very convenient.",

I call my orders in for the most part, as I know they are always busy. The staff is very nice and they always take care of me.   When I have colleagues in from other cities, we normally end up here for lunch. They always love the food too. My office caters from them on occasion as well. I've never heard any complaints or anything negative.   It's funny, I use to live near Fuji, which is their sister location and I was highly upset that I was no longer close to there, so when I found out Red Ginger is a sister location, my excitement could not be contained.  The food is so good. When I get my order, I always know I'm going to be satisfied and full. The amount of food you get is always more than enough. The sushi is great too. Just be mindful that they get busy around lunch, even with to go orders.",

Rule #1 at Red Ginger: make sure you get everyone in your party here at the same time. They won't sit a partial party at the hibachi tables. And do you blame them? How fair is it to sit you down when half your group is late? So, don't be a dick and complain about that.  Get your phone ready to video: the chef has a squirt bottle of sake and goes around the table to anyone who will take it. He won't stop until you wave your hand when you've had enough (I've tried every way to write this sentence and make it sound as least dirty as possible). I always get hibachi shrimp. I like that they give you both rice and noodles here. For birthdays, they blast music and the lights start flashing when they are bringing out the dessert (complete with a sparkler).   Different specials throughout the week- Wednesday is half price bottles of wine, Friday and Saturday special sushi rolls are BOGO. Gratuity is added to larger parties, so just make sure to pay attention to your tab. They offer free parking in the Two Wells Fargo deck across the street on the weekends and also on week days after 5pm.",

I came for lunch with a few friends and enjoyed their hibachi combo lunch special which includes two choices of meats providing a variety of options from chicken to salmon. I ordered the chicken and scallops combo which comes with a choice of vegetables, fried, white, or brown rice, and soup or green salad. The soup was made hot with just the right amount of scallions and mushrooms to compliment the clear broth. The scallops were evenly cooked and the chicken nicely grilled although a little on the dry side. Overall not a bad deal for $14.50 my only complaints were the long wait for all of our dishes to be brought out (at least a 30 minute wait) and the fact that the meal portions were on the small side with regards to the amount of chicken and the size of the scallops. Service from our waitress Faith was excellent and all in all it was a pretty decent dining experience but don't come expecting to have a feast during lunch time.",

The Rock shrimp was alright, certainly have had better. My seafood hibachi (shrimp, scallops, lobster) was a bit better, but I felt that the shrimp and lobster was a little over cooked.  The complimentary rice served was very good. You also received two kinds of dipping sauce for your meal.  I didn't opt for the grill side hibachi tables, but the crowds there looked to have fun. People were laughing and interacting with the chefs. At some point music was played and a few people stood up to show off a few dance moves. I'm guessing the free sake had a hand in that happening. So if you want to visit, the hibachi section may be worth it.  I wasn't sure I would return, but there are a few sushi rolls I would like to try, but that's about it.",

The food was delicious and so entertaining to watch! The kids really enjoyed it. Portions were also generous. No kids menu but it was easy to split the hibachi chicken. I had the hibachi filet, others had steak and scallops. The salad and soup were good. The fried rice and noodles were great! The steak scallops and veggies also great! Reasonably priced drinks. Overall had a great experience and will return!",

    "text": "Came here with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago simply because we wanted hibachi but wanted something different rather than going to the typical Nakatos or Kabutos(helped me realize Charlotte may need more of these kind of places). I will say overall I love the set up of this restaurant because you can choose between a more intimate setting or family style in front of the grill. The pro to this place is that they give you plenty of food. However, this place wasn't my favorite and after trying the food here i wouldn't mind going back to Nakatos. First, we asked the server to recommend a good sake because the list was confusing. She recommended one based on the smell and not the actually taste but did say it was popular so we gave it a try and it was awfulllllll! It took everything in us to actually try and finish it and let's just say we were unsuccessful. Next, it was clear the chef was bored with his typical routine as he rushed through it and was ready to move on to the next table. I also ordered a sushi roll thinking it would come as an appetizer like most places do just for it not to come at all, the server never even asked if I still wanted it you could tell she was completely clueless. Luckily, my expectations weren't too high to begin with because we simply wanted a quick nice dinner but I will say there was nothing that persuaded me to return outside of maybe the cute set up but I'm sure I can find that elsewhere.",

Most of us just ended up ordering off the menu because the fixed menu included some appetizers choices and dessert choices that didn't seem worth the $30 price tag.  I ordered the teriyaki salmon and shrimp with brown rice.  It was very good.  Everyone liked their food, although a tad pricey (expect to drop $20 per person not including drinks here).  The staff was friendly and the hibachi chefs are always entertaining.  I would eat here again, but didn't give it 5 stars because at this price point for me to give out 5 stars, I would have to be blown away.  I also surveyed my friends and everyone agreed they would rate it 4 out of 5 based on all factors of service, food, and price.",

Seated immediately (good, but I had made reservations well in advance). The chef was terrible.  No personality. No smile. No communication. Acted as if he was in a huge hurry to be finished.  Practically ran from the grill when finished cooking. I, my daugher, and another person all had to ask for extra sauce before he left.  He was hurriedly pushing his cart away and as I was at the closest corner, I asked him to refill my sauce; he then tried to rush away as my daughter asked for him to refill hers.  Another lady at the far end called for him too, and then another person in her group as well.  This was a convenient location to eat after a play at the Knight Theater, but with so-so food, and bad service, I won't go back and would not recommend it.",

    "text": "I had so many high hopes for this place. However, our chef apparently was not feeling it today. This was reflected in the fact every time he had extra servings, he gave it to the young blonde on the other side, and he overcooked the shrimp, lobster, and scallops. Even my filet was over cooked. Then the real deal breaker was the fact that he forgot my husband's side of chicken. When pointing it out to the chef, he was like what...with an attitude. We asked for a manager, we got the hostess. She offered to have it cooked in the back, but at this point I don't want them to cook nothing else for me. Even the miso soup was watered-down. The real manager came over and asked if he could treat us to a dessert. After telling him that our Father's day experience was ruined and that I'm a yelper, he took the ticket and gave us a 20% discount and a $10 gift card (with an expiration date & limited to dinner only). Um yeah dude, if that's your version of customer service...you could have kept that card. Our server was good...cleared dishes promptly & kept the drinks filled. He's the only reason I left any part of a tip. I don't see myself coming back. Hard to support a place that doesn't seem like appreciate my money. If you can't get decent service when you order the most expensive thing on the menu, why would I come back to use this card? Good luck with this place, but I'd rather go to Kabutos where at least the portions are larger and cooked better.",

However, this restaurant offered neither. To begin, our reservation was for 7 pm. We arrived at 6:15. I went to the bathroom, & when I returned I asked the people in my party did they tell the hostess about the reservation, the hostess then said (as I wasn't talking to her) the reservation is at 7, like it was a problem that we arrived early. That may have been the case, but I am used to a nicer tone. We then get to the table, the waitress did not take her time, argued with one person in our party that I said that I was allergic to shrimp only, when I clearly said that I had a shrimp  and mushroom allergy, of which she wrote down in her note pad before she left the table. In addition, The food was just ok. It was not like what I've experienced in the Winston Salem area (cheaper & better)?.  To top off the rudeness, and the ok food, the prices were steep, and any party over 6 has an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the total...meaning after taxes. 20% gratuity added to a bill should be because of beyond excellent service. The service did not match the amount paid at all. Let's not talk about the other waitress that rolled her eyes as she turned around from the other table, as they appeared, judging by her gestures, to be getting on her nerves. Finally, As we were leaving, I asked the hostess where to write a review, and she said \"yelp, why were we bad\" I wonder why that was the first thing she said, instead of thinking positive about the restaurant. This is a privately owned restaurant. I no because I asked the waitress was this restaurant a franchise, she said no, it has a private owner. To sum it all up. I felt this restaurant was very ghetto, rude, not worth the money, and not worth returning too. The most positive thing here was that this restaurant has free parking.",

    "text": "The first disclaimer I need to make is that I lived in Japan for five years and married a Japanese woman. So I know Japanese food, and I'm fully aware that the \"Japanese Grill \" type restaurant is usually not at all Japanese. I'm okay with that, I have sat at such grills in the US and had a chef entertain me while he cooked up something that has no resemblance to Japanese food, and it's tasty. And fun. So, if you like that experience and either understand or don't care that it has very little resemblance to Japanese food, this place is probably okay. I found it interesting that one of the reviewers who gave it very high marks said he didn't care for sushi. That's like going to McDonald's when you don't care for fast food. Anyway, I just sat at the sushi bar and had some appetizers and sushi. Oh, I had the daily special drinks, and they were very watered down but what do you expect for the daily special cocktail? The sushi was okay, the presentation of it was quite good and when I was there late on a Saturday night, the sushi chefs were friendly and very polite. The sushi selection is limited, and as at most \"Japanese \" restaurants in the US, the chefs were not Japanese, there were some a very common Japanese sushi items that they didn't even know about. Again, I know that's very common so I can't knock them too much for that, but it's one clear mark of a very good sushi bar when they have those special Japanese items. The appetizers were a mix of some truly Japanese items and some fusion creations. Some of them were pretty good, such as the chicken cheese roll. Nothing Japanese about it except the look, but it was tasty. So, overall nothing bad and if I was uptown with some people who for some reason wanted to have the Japanese Grill experience, I would go there I guess, but I would never choose to go there to have a good dining experience otherwise.",

Sake bombs were inexpensive but the food was on the pricier side and just typical hibachi style food. The hibachi chef messed up his tricks a few times but we were very forgiving after a few sake bombs. Not sure I'll come again but good for a party.",

Next we ordered the bento box I order chicken teriyaki with brown rice. the chicken was over cooked and more flavor could have been put into the meal.  The music selection while your eating is way too loud it sounds like a club for what you can hear on the radio.  this place has great potential just hire a kitchen staff who can bring more to the table.",

    "text": "I hate to give bad reviews, but I feel like I should warn people before coming here.   The only reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because I came during restaurant week (unknowingly), and I know that can be hectic time for restaurants.   I had the chicken avocado for an appetizer, chicken and shrimp hibachi as an entree, and the green tea ice cream for dessert. The hibachi came with your traditional miso soup and ginger salad. It was weird because even though my fiance and I ordered the same salad, we had different kinds if lettuce.   All the food was bland. Even the sauces with the food was bland. I feel like everything I tried I felt like it \"needed something\".   The service was awful. It took forever to get water refills and I had to ask for sauces for the hibachi twice. The only time the service picked up was when we asked for the check and dessert to go.  It was definitely not worth the money. I probably won't go back nor would I recommend it.",

The one positive experience we had was our server; he was very accommodating, and pleasant- thank you for making this experience tolerable.",

Took me having to flag her down before she refilled water/tea.  No eye contact with us or a 'thank you' when she dropped off the bill.  I think the root cause is having waitresses cover both the hibachi grill area (where there are a good 10+ people) AND the dining tables.  Sushi was just average.  I've had better at a lower cost.",

My sushi roll was ok at best, but was not at all filling. I felt as if I had ordered an appetizer. I had to add an order of hibachi, which was ok at best to feel as though I had eaten. $30 dollars later (at lunch) I was full.  The waitress sucked. She was slow moving, not friendly, didn't check on us, and didn't ask how I wanted the steak cooked for the Hibachi. I was under the impression that she wasn't working for tips, because her service was that bad.  Lastly I sat at the sushi bar and was not really able to observe the sushi being created. The sushi chef's were not friendly or inviting. They need to travel to some better restaurants and take note of how to treat customers.  That will more than likely be my last visit to Red Ginger.",

    "text": "Visiting Charlotte for a bachelorette party, I had the pleasure of dining at Red Ginger one night! We were there for sushi, so we didn't go for the large hibachi table on the far side of the restaurant. The hibachi side was poppin' though, which made our table service a bit slow. Our server was friendly and smiled at us though and the food MORE than made up for any service delay, which is something I'm usually hard pressed to say. I had two rolls, both with spicy tuna (my fave of all faves). It was excellent. Like, really really excellent. I am from Florida and live in Alaska, two places known for their epic fish dishes, and I have eaten sushi since I was 8 years old (my dad would give me salmon sashimi saying \"it tastes like butter\"). I have had a lot of great sushi on both coasts, but Red Ginger is definitely on the short list. I am considering driving the 2 hrs from Asheville to go to Red Ginger again on this trip to the lower 48, though, because it was THAT good.",

The first plate that arrived was not the one I ordered.  The one I ordered had been given to an adjacent table, so I had to wait for another to be prepared.  Overall the experience was bearable.  Drinks, however, are another story.  There is no real bartender here, so you have to hope that your waiter is versed in the art of pouring beers.  This is a long shot.  The guy behind the bar poured us three full-foam pints before someone came out of the back and managed to pour a decent glass.  If you are ordering a cocktail then welcome to the roulette table!  I saw the bartender's bible come to aid in the creation of a Jack and Coke...not what you want to see.  Ordering a glass of wine was equally as disheartening.  The real problem, in my opinion, is that there isn't a manager to make sure things are running smoothly.  Most of the waiters stand in the corner and look back and forth between the impatient clients and the other waiters.  If Red Ginger makes it to 2014 I will be surprised.",

Also, the option to not sit around the hibachi is cool if you want your intimacy, but I recommend doing so anyway as we did not sit around the hibachi and my bf's food came out cold while mine was piping out as they brought it all at once instead of as its done. Thought the sushi was just average. Nikko is a better alternative, a bit more expensive but worth the extra dollars.",

I called the day before to make a reservation so the restaurant wasn't surprised by a big group. We were seated promptly but the service we received afterwards was horrendous. Half of my party order cokes or other beverages besides water. Those drinks weren't served until after our main course arrived. We had to eat our salads, soups, and appetizers with water. We tried to flag down our waiter to no avail and he never came back to check on us.   The waiter also forgot certain orders or completely got them wrong. For example my boss ordered a soup that came with the meal. The waiter brought a salad instead. After the meal I asked if boss if he ever received his soup and he said no. The waiter also messed up others orders as well.  In total it took us an hour and a half for us to have our meal. Needless to say we had people who had to leave mid meal in order to join afternoon meetings/conference calls.  The bill came with a 20% gratuity. I'm assuming that is because we were a big party. I wouldn't have even tipped our waiter if it was up to me. I will never go back to Red Ginger because the service was so bad.    Our waiters name was Maliek.",

We were seated when our entire party arrived and our servers took our orders very quickly. Almost everyone in our large group ordered some form of hibachi.   Unfortunately, pretty much everything about this place fell flat for me. Our chef barely talked to us (his way of interacting with us was giving sarcastic remarks when we asked him a question) and didn't do any of the cooking techniques that people love about hibachi - no knife tosses, no onion volcano, nothing.   As for the food - it wasn't great. We all agreed that the food had a weird taste. There was also a lack of flavor and seasoning in the food beyond soy sauce. Also, several people in our party who ordered the hibachi steak and chicken didn't get the small portion of shrimp that is supposed to come with every meal.   To sum it up, I welcome your recommendations for great hibachi grills in CLT because I have yet to find one!",

    "text": "THIS REVIEW REGARDS CATERING ONLY:  Last week, I was trying to put together lunches at my office for a LONG week of training.  Someone recommended Red Ginger as they offer Hibachi and Sushi catering on their website.  I remembered having eaten here a few years ago and thought 'hmm... good idea!' So I filled out the contact form on their website and left for the day (this was last Monday, 23 July).    The following day, I had neither missed messages nor emails.  I waited until their opening time at 4:30PM and called.  There was no answer.  There was, however, a full mailbox.  So, I decided to give them ONE more day to respond to me.  Alas, Wednesday came, and at 4:30PM, I tried calling again.  The woman who answered on the other end did not even greet me with a \"Hello! Red Ginger!\"  It was just a blank \"hello\"... I might've had the wrong number?  So I asked... \"Is this Red Ginger?\"... her response? \"Um, yeah?\"  So I asked, \"I'm trying to set up catering for a business lunch next week... May I speak to someone to place an order?\"... Her response? \"Um... catering?\"... Yes, I reply, your website has a catering menu.  Again, she speaks... \"Yeah, um, my manager isn't here.\" ... on and on until she FINALLY asked if she could take down my number for her manager, and we hung up... No customer service, no urgency, no sense of caring AT ALL!!!!  I can only assume from the tone of this call (COUPLED with the fact that NO ONE ever returned my call) that Red Ginger is simply NOT interested in taking orders for business catering.  In short: We ordered a lovely lunch from P.F. Chang's.",

Food was good but not outstanding. Too much rice and noodles. Also, restaurant is at the corner of College and MLK and not on Tryon. We wandered around until we found it - all of us in heels... not fun.",

So I asked to be seated, was never offered a hibachi table I had to ask. Once seated the table had already ordered and was in a \"hurry\"'so I had to order quickly. Never having seen the menu I ordered and they repeatedly questioned my choice letting me know \"no teriyaki\" at the hibachi table as if I didn't know what I was ordering which pissed me off. Don't let my complexion fool you into doubting my intelligence . Sushi was subpar and not the best, hibachi chicken was rubbery, hibachi steak bland, choice of sauces bland, Long Island Ice Tea tasted cheap, the hibachi veggies and fried rice were really good. Waitress was alright. Do not go unless you order to go or like being treated like you're poor and receiving poor food.",

    "text": "I'll begin at the beginning... We arrived long before the rest of the party so I made sure to put our name down and found a seat at the bar. Where was the bartender? It seems he was also waiting tables? Needless to say, we waited at least 20 minutes before being asked what we wanted and by then, my order was reduced to a wine because I didn't want to chance ordering something that required actually mixing liquids together...that would've just taken longer.  Once the rest of the party arrived we were able to get seats at the hibachi tables...YEAH! PLEASE MAKE A RESERVATION IF YOU WANT TO SIT AT THE HIBACHI TABLE!   Again, we waited. Waited to be asked what we wanted. Waited to be given our soup and salads. Waited for our chef to come over. In the meantime, we watched a nearby table and the chef was so much fun! The people were having a great time. However, the chef behind him was boring. The people were just eating. There were no tricks or squirts of saki, nothing! We prayed to get the other guy. Unfortunately, he went to another table. Fortunately, we did get a fun chef. So it's a crap shoot when it comes to the chefs and how much fun you may or, may not, have. The food was ok. The lobster didn't taste fresh at all though. The filet and shrimp were fine.   In addition to our hibachi, we also ordered specialty rolls, which they forgot to bring us. We ate those for lunch the next day. Overall, I'm not running back to this place. I see why people like it, but again, the chefs make it fun and if you don't get a fun chef, it's just hibachi. Might as well sit at one of the other tables.",

The music was good but way too loud to hear the waiter never mind carry on conversation. When we asked that they turn it down, they did so quickly.  One ordered the M-16 roll, another the duck roll , an order of Tuna Tataki, and I  ordered the Angry bird as an appetizer. Beautiful presentation, the rolls were very good, not as good as our favorite place for Sushi, but good none the less. The Tuna was exceptional, one of the best I've ever tasted!  The salad was OK, typical salad with some sort of \"ginger\" dressing. The soup was meh with a bit of pepper heat.  We all ordered Hibachi dishes and sat around the table. The show was the typical show, always enjoyable! Our Chef was wonderful, the food was fantastic... filet was cooked as requested, shrimp, scallops and lobster were delicious. My only comment was the chicken was a bit tough. Flavor was wonderful though.  Drinks... a bit on the small side, and the wine was a definite under pour. Still good though.  The wait staff were attentive and very friendly so no complaints there.  I would definitely go back if dining downtown before an event but doubt I would go downtown just to eat here.",

Just feels like you have plenty of elbow room, etc.  The food was on par with any other place I've been to in the same vein as this.  The sushi (wasabi roll) in particular was impressive.  One of the best rolls I've had in a while.  The hibachi chef was really friendly and the entire wait staff was great.  The biggest challenge facing this place is how to attract weekend business.  I'd guess to say the lunch crowd is solide but we ended up there on a Saturday night and it was not even half full.  I hope it picks up because I'd like to see this place stick around.",

The chef wasn't as engaged with our table as they are in other places, he seemed a little rushed, and it wasn't even that busy...granted there was 7 girls talking so he probably figured what we were talking about was much more interesting than a volcano made from onions! ;-)  I had the Hibachi steak and shrimp. The shrimp was really under seasoned, and over cooked. I also split a sushi roll which was OK, it was no CowFish but not terrible either. The prices are pretty average for a Japanese restaurant, but the food lacked in flavor.  We got a complimentary tempura banana dessert, and it was odd...the texture of tempura doesn't go well with bananas.  I'd stick with Nakato for Hiabachi and hands down The Cowfish for sushi...best sushi in Charlotte. Its not that I would never go back to Red Ginger but I wouldn't put this at the top of my list for great uptown restaurants. I've also seen Groupons for Red Ginger but don't really think it's worth it, don't feel it's that great of a deal for the prices.",

He said it was very fresh and the goyza was good but nothing better than of changs. We both got hibachi which is a large portion. I'm allergic to shell fish so the chef was super careful and cooked my meat first which was nice of them. The hibachi was pretty good and cooked well. The deal included dessert too and he got fried bananas and I got fried ice cream... Definitely their downfall it was horrible. The bananas had zero taste other than oil. The fried part of the ice cream was not done and the ice cream was gritty like it was in the freezer for a year. Don't ever get dessert there!!! It was gross we left it there after one bite.

Once he returned we ordered, and thus starts the long, long, wait.... My son ordered sushi, my wife ordered a wine and a salad and shrimp (both fried and sushi style), and I just wanted some fried rice. Her salad came in about 5 minutes, still no wine. About 10 minutes later the wine arrived, still with only her salad being served, the waiter asks \"is there anything else I can get you?\" And we all chimed in at the same time \"yes, our food\". Another 20min rolls by and my son gets his sushi, so now we are missing shrimp and fried rice. Total time at this point, about 40 min. Another 5 minutes, I get my rice and my wife gets half her shrimp. The other half the order was never put in. Time to go! We've had enough!",

First off we called ahead to make a reservation and they stated they do not take same day reservations, they asked our party number to which we stated 16 and they stated to come in and they will work with us to get us in. Our group of 16 walked in and they stated that because we didn't have a reservation or call ahead that it would be a two hour wait ad that they would be unable to do anything for us. We asked what the point of our phone call earlier was and they stated there was nothing they could do. They were rude in all aspects of their communication to our group and just ignored us from there on out and picked up their phones and just pretended to talk to people. I am in from out of town and this puts a horrible viewpoint of Charlotte.  This was the most rude example of customer service that I have been a part of.",

For lunch you have options for multiple combos to accommodate your mood: Sushi combos, habachi combos and event bento boxes. Depending on the protein you add these are typically all between $9-$15. I like the maki sushi combo which includes two rolls for $10 or three for $13 - it also comes with soup/salad.   The sushi is okay - nothing to rave about, I tried the eel today and it didn't taste like it was prepared well. It was very mushy - it tasted good though, but I'm a texture person so that threw me off.   Service is fine, a little slow but friendly. I like the option to sit outside right along MLK Jr. Blvd and people watch.  Overall, I think it's worth considering if you're looking for a quick uptown lunch under $15.",

Not that I like it that much, and also not saying I don't but I will say, the consistency is a HUGE reason why I keep coming back. I know what I'm going to get when I get here, and that doesn't mean only food wise. The customer service is always very good. The chef is always welcoming and entertaining and I've had several chefs and they all display the same consistency in their performance and exciting attitude. The food is exceptional! Though I only get the Salmon and Shrimp not one time have I been disappointed in the outcome. The pricing is moderate, I typically spend about $50-$53 for 2 people each time. The place is clean, the bathrooms are always clean, and to top it off, they validate for parking! Not only will I definitely be back, I would recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE.

They validate parking at the Two Wells Fargo center garage which is really awesome. They also won't seat you until your whole party arrives, so make sure you're prepared for that.   I got the chicken hibachi dinner. Both the salad and soup that it came with were good. I also like that their hibachi comes with noodles and rice which is unique. I really didn't like their yum yum sauce. It tasted like it was watered down and didn't have much flavor. They also gave you a giver sauce which was pretty good. The worst part of my meal was the chicken. It was so dry and flavorless that I ended up not eating it. The others that got chicken also agreed.   We came for my friend's birthday and both our chef and waitress knew it was her birthday. We listened to two other birthday celebrations by the restaurant, but they never did anything for my friend. We asked about it and they still didn't do anything.   I've heard that they have good sushi, so if I come back again, I would probably get that, but I don't think the hibachi was worth it.",

I had difficulty finding the restaurant due to the GPS taking us in the opposite direction. However, after calling and missing our previous reservation time, the hostess was able to get us a table shortly after arriving. Upon checking in, my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and order drinks. I ordered the Apple Martini and he order a cranberry and vodka. The drinks were well prepared. We sat down, there was a little wait, but I believe that is due to limited wait staff that evening. Our chef was entertaining and quick and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. I was given a cheesecake with a sparkler, which was cute and fun. The only downside was the rather long wait we experienced once telling our server we wanted to pay the tab. Other than that, I would definitely visit this establishment again.",

I would say the salmon and halibut were the best. As for the salad, fresh lettuce, but the ginger sauce was definitely not my favorite. Ended up eating it without the dressing because it just had a horrible taste. I also ordered a cup of the Clear Soup, which was pretty bland compared to other Hibachi restaurants.

    "text": "My rating is 4.5 stars.   After taking in The Most Incredible Thing, a ballet at Knight Theater, it was just past 16:00. My friends and I were hungry, as we hadn't had lunch.  I did a search on my Yelp app. We headed over to Red Ginger, which is right across from the venue. It specializes in both sushi, sashimi, and teppanyaki (Americans refer to it as hibachi).  I ordered the scallops and chicken teppanyaki. It comes with fried noodles and fried rice. Wow! Normally, you are asked whether you want one or the other. My order also came with shrimp. I thought that it was a mistake that I was given shrimp. Again, it was completely unexpected.  What was expected? I got mushroom and onion soup, and miso ginger salad with my meal. I also ordered a Diet Coke. You do get refills.  I first sat in-between both my friends. However, my left-handed friend was to my right. Bumping into each other while eating would have  been annoying, as I am right-handed. I moved to her right. I lucked out. Whenever our chef had an abundance of food cooked on the teppanyaki grill, I would get it. Yay, me!  Our chef was entertaining. As expected, he created a flaming onion volcano. Naturally, I captured it on my phone, because that's who I am.  The food was tasty. This place is exceptionally generous with portions. I loved all of it.   My friends and I were hungry. We were quiet having our soup and salad. Both were delicious and immediately stopped our hunger pangs.  The chicken was tender and perfectly done. The scallops were juicy and perfect, as were the shrimp. I loved the fried noodles and rice. I was also glad that the veggies did not have zucchini. I ate everything!  The only point that prevents me from giving this place a perfect rating is service. When we first walked in, the restaurant wasn't busy. Two women were standing there. It took one of them nearly a minute to come over and seat us. Weird.  I paid for all of us and asked for the bill. The bill didn't take much time. However, it took just under ten minutes for the server to fetch my credit card to settle the bill.  Other than that detail, I had a good time here. It can run a bit on the expensive side, but you get more food than you expect at a teppanyaki place.  (138)",

The ambiance was great, it is very simple, chic and clean. The hibachi looked great although we are sushi junkies so we sat at a table next to the sushi bar. We ordered the sushi appetiser and the crispy duck roll to begin along with an Asahi beer each and large saki all were great and the service was wonderful. The manager came over and said hello and so did one of the chefs from the Fuji location we received a complimentary champagne cocktail which was super nice. Well then we ordered dinner , 4 rolls, the specialty Monster roll, The Empire roll ( my fav), The West Ashley roll and the American Dream roll... They were all fabulous and presented awesomely .... We tipped our sushi chef well and they sent over a spicy tuna kani pocket complimentary. For desert we had the fried cheese cake. We were over all extremely pleased with our dinner and glad we picked such a great place for a New Years meal.",

One great thing is that there is free valet on the weekends, which was an automatic plus.  They have hibachi seating and regular table seating. For a Friday night it was empty, very empty. The prices are pretty low, dinner hibachi starts about $17 which is cheap for an Uptown dinner. Their drinks weren't good but that can depend on the bartender. The food was very good. I got the lobster and steak hibachi, it starts off with a salad and miso soup.   I would like to visit and try out their sushi. Monday and Thursdays are buy one roll get on free.",

The food is good and the price is reasonable compared to the other hibachi restaurants. The service was okay, no one was really that friendly.. I mean really, I've encountered nicer employees working the Starbucks morning rush! There are far better hibachi places in the Charlotte area. So unless you're immediately Uptown and don't want to venture out, I'd suggest going somewhere that's far more worth your money.",

At first glance you will notice a regular seating area then in the back, there are group tables for the \"cook in front of you\" experience.  While eating there, the staff gave a 16 year old boy a birthday treat to celebrate his birthday.  What a fantastic gesture with nothing to gain from it. The food was amazing and freshly prepared at the table. The chef was full of appropriate humor at all times and have generous portions of food to each guest. The restaurant is very clean and so were the bathrooms.  Although, I would avoid using coupons or even Yelp check-in rewards here.  The waitress took my phone to the kitchen with her to figure out how to use the Yelp Check-in free appetizer reward.  That kind of made me nervous.  All-in-all, great time, great food, and a great staff.",

    "text": "Went early on a Friday night (6:30), and it was slow but not empty. Free valet parking is always a good thing when going to dinner downtown. Interior was very nice, with a hip, urban Asian feel. Hostess was uninterested but not quite rude. My wife and I love sushi, and enjoy an occasional cheesy-but-fun hibachi night, so we decided to sit at a hibachi table, split an entree, and get some sushi as well. There were 2 other couples at our table, both were drinking and smily but not obnoxious, so it was a good social setting for date night. Got asked for drink orders immediately, and they came out quickly. I was happy to see that they had Sapporo on draft, which was icy and delicious. The server didn't offer any suggestions and seemed limited in English, but was smiley and quick so no real complaints there.  The entree we split came with soup and salad, both of which were good, and both came out together and very quickly. I had the house salad with ginger dressing, and it was one of the better ginger dressings I've had in Charlotte. Probably 5 minutes later our sushi came out. My wife's pregnant, so we couldn't get anything raw, but we got 2 rolls centered around tempura shrimp and eel, both of which were above average in quality. No complaints on the sushi.  Our hibachi chef came out within about 10 minutes of ordering our entree, and was a good performer, full of smiles and lame-but-enjoyable hibachi jokes. Did the standard \"egg roll\" and flaming onion volcano, etc. 2 things he did that you don't always find at Hibachi - he tossed pieces of partially cooked zucchini in everyone's mouths, which was a lot of fun (even though my wife was the only one who didn't catch hers. We'll need to work on that before we come back); and best of all, he went around the table squirting saki in everyone's mouths! Never seen that before, and it got a lot of laughs and appreciation at the table.  Food from hibachi was good but not particularly outstanding (except for the shrimp sauce, which would make a leather shoe taste delicious). We got steak and shrimp, both of which were cooked well. They also give you soba noodles with your entree, which you don't often get in hibachi restaurants. Between 1 entree and 2 sushi rolls, my wife and I left STUFFED. In hindsight, 1 roll would have been enough, but hey, when in Rome right?  All in all, I didn't have any complaints, had a good, fun meal for a reasonable price, and we'll most definitely be back. Would be a GREAT place to go with 6 or 8 friends for a birthday party, especially considering it's the only hibachi restaurant I know of in Charlotte between University and Tyvola. Because it wasn't particularly busy on a Friday night, I do worry that they won't stay in business, but hope that they are just going through a combination of new restaurant meets winter weather, and that their business will warm up with the weather.",

The waitress was fine, not great but not awful. But then....halfway thru our meal, a HUGE COCKROACH crawled across my co workers plate. She screamed and jumped up. No one came over to check on us. Finally a bus boy killed it with a napkin. They put her food in a box and the waitress comped her meal. Still, no sign of manager coming over to apologize. I get it, restaurants have bugs it's almost impossible to get rid of them all. But the way they handled it was terrible. Still no sign of manager or an apology. When we were about to leave the manager finally came over and snatched the to go box out off table and said \"if you don't pay you can't have food\" she wasn't planning on taking the food with her anyway, and it was extremely rude. It wasn't her fault a roach crawled across her plate.",

I will have to say that I was not overly impressed with the sushi menu. It's limited compared to other sushi bars I've been to in Charlotte. When I asked to make a substitution in one of the rolls, they were happy to accommodate. I then ordered chicken teriyaki which was somewhat disappointing although the accompanying salad with ginger dressing was very fresh, crisp and flavorful.

The tamago came out in a martini glass - gorgeous presentation - two pieces of triangled egg, with two tempura wrapped shrimp. Absolutely wonderful. The Angry Bird was also delicious. The problem that night was that there were 100's of tiny flies swarming about. After my first sip of wine, the first fly decided to sip it as well. Then a second, third and forth.   The waitress explained there was nothing she could do. \"The management will not allow us to take charges off of the bill. If we do, it comes out of our pay.\" I paid $12 for a glass of wine that I never drank.  Last night I returned and sat inside. My guest ordered the hibachi shrimp ($7.) Not sure exactly what we were expecting, but it wasn't 6 pieces of grilled shrimp on a lettuce leaf. I ordered the Tamago again, but this time I received plain, ol' tamago. When I asked what I received two weeks prior, the waitress (the same one I had two weeks ago) had no idea what I was talking about. I described it, drew a photo, but nothing - no idea what I was talking about.   The Lemon Drop was strong - perhaps too strong. My guest couldn't get past the first 2 sips.   $40 for a cocktail that was too strong, 6 pieces of shrimp, 3 pieces of plain tamago, and some good Angry Bird sushi.  I wish them luck, but all early signs point to being closed within a year.",

One star off because it took her a long time to make my drink, and she poured it out twice while making it. She eventually called over the manager. It was good once I got it though.   We ordered the shrimp appetizer, which is assorted nigiri. It was pretty good. We got the rock shrimp which was fried lightly with a spicy sauce. It was awesome. We also got the tuna pizza and crispy duck roll. The duck roll was wrapped in a rice wrapper and chilled. It was unexpected, but very good.   Overall, we will definitely return. The sushi was fresh and beautiful, plus we want to try the hibachi grill.",

Hopefully management can inspire them to make every performance great! Lastly the hostess sat my wife and I at a hibachi table but after we ordered they said they wouldn't cook for us unless others showed up, this is after they already took and served us our drink order. We ended up trying to communicate with the server on how much we needed to order to have someone  cook for us. After 10 minutes of back and fourth other guests showed up to dine with us. Lastly, the food is really good and for this reason I'll be back. Hopefully management can correct the rest of the clear issues.",

When questioned she yelled in my face (yes yelled) that they had a reservation which was a blatant lie (heard them ask for a table and then later confirmed with the party). Upon finally being seated (at the same vacant table that we were asking about during our 12 minute wait to be seated), a Chef comes over to advise that \"someone forgot to turn on the stove and to give him 5 mins\". 15 mins later , no chef, no food and all we had to show for the 50 mins of our lunch break was a few pieces of iceberg lettuce, slice of tomato and water. Needless to say we got up and walked out. Clearly the hostess/ owner does not appreciate or feel the need to provide any customer service.

Most places don't understand the situation and still cook things on the same grill or in the same pan. Her meal was cooked exactly how she wanted it, separately to avoid any contamination. This was exactly what we were looking for and we will be back.   Thanks!",

Another good thing about it, it that it seemed pretty low key and not overly crowded for a saturday night.    The food was great. I had the Red Ginger meal. Service could have been better but it was good enough.  Overall, I had a good time and I'll definitely be back.",

Tried the sushi appetizer which was pretty average, and also tried the calamari appetizer which was pretty average as well.  The soup and salad got the job done, but nothing really stuck out. Salad had a ginger dressing on it.   From my experience with the 2 proteins, I had the steak and the salmon. Both were cooked fine, and they provide you with 2 sauces to dip in as well as a couple of complimentary shrimp. You get to choose fried or white rice, and also get hibachi vegetables.   The deep fried cheesecake was basically a slice of cheesecake dipped in tempura batter, and was it was quite tasty.   The place looks very modern and the ambience definitely fits it. Service was average.   Overall, this is a solid, no-frills hibachi restaurant. The food is cooked well, they put on a show, and at least from my restaurant week experience, I was very full. Although it is difficult for a hibachi restaurant to be crappy, they did a good job. I would probably go back if I was ever craving hibachi. It's not outstanding, but it gets the job done.",

We arrived 30 minutes early to be told there's a party who isn't ready to leave. At one point the hostess with the disfigured hand told us to have thw kids share a seat until the other party leaves...I was baffled by this suggestion of discomfort and absurdity. We wasn't seated until about an hour later. No apology or even speed with service to make up for lost time. We them waited another 30 for drinks orders. Long story short to have spent over 700 dollars in one seating we was displeased. To only leave the restaurant on my daughters birthday to our entire party with good poisoning.. What a fing night. Could you just imagine having family from out of town sick and an emergency room full of kids crying. That following day I managed to call the restaurant and tried to explain what had happened they rudely rusjed me off the phone. Bit luckily the hospital cared enough to send a report to health department since it was a large bumber of us sick that night. ... Never again will I eat here",

We also tried the tuna tataki that bursts with flavor.  Most of the rolls are a good size and have a nice fresh flavor, not overly seasoned with spicy mayo or heavily breaded. Be sure to sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chef is very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations!

Definitely make a reservation online because you may not get a seat at the grill if you do not have a reservation. Also, you can park right across the street and get your parking validated! Don't forget your ticket when you go inside. Amelie's is right across the street and only a few blocks to the Epicenter or TWC Arena! Perfect date night.",

Also, after being in the the restaurant business 15 years I understand the struggle of serving that many people. However, our party was divided in two by two servers. One side of the party was completely taken care of deserves 5 stars. Our side of the party unfortunately had a new server that could not handle it and her other responsibilities. I actually do not blame a server, I blame the management. In addition, management did not get involved until I made a scene by the hostess stand. After her involvement, we did receive a discount but, they still could not figure out all the checks for 10 ppl. Again!!!! POOR MANAGEMENT! Please know of the issues before you go!",

(Honestly, I no longer care to do so.)   A friend of mine arrived 4 minutes before us to ask for hibachi seating for a party of 4. The hostess was very blunt (borderline rude) and advised that since there wasn't a reservation, we (myself, plus 1) would need to arrive immediately. As this is being shared, myself and my plus one are opening the door to step in. Therefore, we are all present and the hostess acknowledges this much. Five minutes following our arrival, another party of 2 walks in requesting hibachi seating for a party of 4 but the other 2 were on the way. The hostess informed them of the same information, that they will need to arrive within 2 minutes to be seated. Well, 4 minutes later (we're now at 9 minutes that our party of 4 has been waiting to be seated) the other 2 individuals walk in to complete the second party of 4 without a reservation. The second party of 4 is immediately seated at the hibachi table and the rude hostess then informs me that we will have to wait maybe an hour or more, following those with a reservation.  In the meantime, she informs another party (with reservation) that they will have to wait another 40 minutes...apparently they had already been waiting an hour. Someone else walked in and one phone call led her to inform both parties that the wait was 20-25 and 30 minutes, respectively.   At this point, we have already decided we're not eating at this establishment because no one knows how long they're expected to wait. Did I mention, there were regular non-hibachi tables open that we and another party were denied also?   With my friend being pregnant and myself being \"hangry\"... we left and enjoyed hibachi in South Charlotte. No thanks, they don't deserve a second-first try for me.",

    "text": "Red Ginger is a trendy Japanese restaurant in Uptown Charlotte.  There is a sushi bar, hibachi grills and regular menu featuring bento options and other Japanese specialties.  My party sat in the bar area which is right inside the door.  I didn't understand the 3 seater bar tables.  Isn't 3 considered a crowd?  You'd think 4 would be more acceptable.  Also the music was way too loud.    For food, I started out with the Rock Shrimp which was actually quite good.  The sauce was a combo of sweet and spicy and it came with several shrimp.   For a meal I went with the Maki B sushi combo which came with spicy tuna, salmon and eel.  It also came with miso soup and a salad.   The soup and salad were quite Meh.  The soup was so salty and it wasn't even a soup, it was more of a broth with 2 pieces of miso and tiny slices of scallion.  The salad wasn't much better - iceberg lettuce, a grape tomato, slice of cucumber and a ginger dressing that tasted more like thousand island.    The sushi was decent but I thought it was overpriced.  For bar selections, they do have a few craft beer draft selections but nothing local.  Too bad.    Service wise, we were served by the bartender who we had to call over each time we needed something.  Other than that, food came out quickly.     I don't know if this is worth my time for a repeat visit.  I think there are better sushi places in Charlotte.  But perhaps, I'll try them sometime for the hibachi grill.",

    "text": "New restaurant in uptown Charlotte, located within the vicinity of The Green and the Bechtler museum. Upon entering the restaurant,  I'm approached with a sweet rendition of minimalistic meets modern. Half of the restaurant is plastered with earthly toned stones, complemented by applewood tables and gray chairs embellished with silver embroidery. Very simple yet so chic and classy.. just my style! I noticed a projector beside the bar so I assume Red Ginger is planning on upholding the trend of many new restaurants-restaurant by day, bar/lounge by night. There are also designated hibachi grills, if you're looking for dinner and a show.   We ordered their specialty dish, the \"Red Ginger,\" which comes with 4oz. filet mignon (cooked to your liking of course), lobster tail, shrimp, spinach and a truffle mushroom sauce. If you're aiming to please a date, this is a must order! The presentation is enough to make you drool. Close your eyes and now, imagine a castle made of a piece of filet mignon that sits over a bed of veggies. A moat of light mushroom sauce surrounds this castle with several shrimps swimming around the mignon. The lobster meat sits on top, completing the castle structure. The casting of the lobster tail acts as the turret as it hovers behind the entire plate. Mmmm.. well, now you can check out the photo I posted!   We also ordered the Wasabi Shrimp. To be honest, we were deciding between the Black Cod and the Wasabi Shrimp, but just wanted the bragging rights of ordering WASABI Shrimp! Luckily, the dish turned out to be delicious. About 8 pieces of prawn sits on a bed of string carrots. A sweet and sour wasabi sauce is drizzled over the shrimp, while maintaining the shrimp's crunchy/flaky texture. I took small bites, hoping to savor every moment. My only complaint is that I was expecting the shrimp to come with rice, veggies, etc since it was under the main entrees section. This seems more like an appetizer than an entree to me, but nonetheless I enjoyed it.   Overall, I had a great experience at Red Ginger (I'm guessing they can never serve white ginger though?). The ambiance is modern, yet simple. The staff is friendly and the food delicious. Prices range from about $12-$27, depending on what you get. It's a good place for a nice date or a special occasion. Besides, $27 is not bad at all for a castle made of filet mignon and lobster (or, you know, whatever you imagine it to be).",

When the service came to give me the sushi couldn't even tell me which sushi was which. But the service was just horrible, bad attitude from the start. We didn't even get finish with our meal and she already came to give us our checks. I think this place is only really for hibachi. Would not recommend this place. I can deal with the mediocre food but bad service too.",

    "text": "So amazingly enough I've been here two separate times - but for the same occasion:  a friend's birthday dinner.  Since my visits were literally separated by a year, it's good to see that this place has staying power.  Located in Uptown, it is definitely an experience to go eat here.  Both birthday dinner times were with a large crowd 8-10 and we had reservations.  Once everyone arrived, we were promptly sat at our table and the servers got our drink orders and food orders.  The chef/entertainer comes out and confirms all our orders and then starts cooking right in front of us.  I'm a sucker for showmanship, but the chefs pull out all the tricks:  flaming onion volcano, fake ketchup bottle squirting, etc.  Probably the funnest thing is when the chef offers everyone some sake and proceeds to squirt the sake in peoples mouths until they had enough.  This latest visit was the entire table catching broccoli in their mouths...  Good times -  The staff are really good here keeping your drinks flowing and catering to your needs.  I'd say its a solid \"birthday dinner place.\"",

Unfortunately her soda taps needed to be changed out as my soda was flat & another one was out completely, so she had to keep going to the waiter station for refills.  Hallelujah - they have Pepsi products!    Sweetie got the Shrimp with Fried Rice and Veggies.  The Shrimp weren't fresh & were over cooked.  The rice was o.k.  The veggies was mostly zucchini strips. Meh.  I got the Sashimi Lunch.  It was supposed to have 9 pieces, but came out with only 5 (which is the number on the Sushi Lunch).  They quickly brought the rest of the pieces.  Not a big variety, though.  Only 3 different ones...Tuna, Salmon & a whitefish.  I requested that I not get the Eel or Octopus, so thankfully, I didn't get those.  It was a pretty presentation & it was fresh.  Once you've got fresh down on sashimi, you usually can't go wrong.  They played an odd muzak mix of lounge-type tunes.  At least it wasn't '80's music.  It was convenient, and I'd go again for the sashimi, but probably not the other plates.",

It's not so tough on the wallet either, considering all that you are getting...the soups are delicious and the portion sizes are very generous.
