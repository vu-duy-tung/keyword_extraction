    "text": "First time visiting Fin and Fino and it was a great experience.  The online menu is only a sampling of what they serve so don't be discouraged if you don't see many options to choose from.  We split about 7 or 8 plates and they were fresh, creatively prepared, and tasty. The server was friendly, knowledgeable, and checked on us throughout the night as we kept ordering. The atmosphere was spacious and clean.  The only thing I wish they would improve is the wine list.  What's up with these below par wines that no one has ever heard of and can't even be purchased in wine stores??  Rebranded leftovers sold cheap by distributors I suppose.",

Now the big question is the TASTE...definitely subpar!  First, my family ordered the banh mi shrimp, and as a Vietnamese person, I was expecting a toasted French baguette with shrimp in the middle.  I was totally wrong when it showed up. It was more of a banh mi-less shrimp (bread less) but they call it banh mi shrimp!  Nonetheless it tasted liked grill shrimp - OK.  Secondly, the skirt steak, presentation amazing but the the chef was too generous on the salt with it! Wayyy too salty!!! Cut it back like 10 notches chef! We also ordered the smoked salmon which was also salty! I gotta to admit, the place is fancy but the food needs to cut back on the salt! I think I got hypertension now. Overall superb staff, beautiful location but salty food!",

Since, I was bit upset, I asked the bartender to make me a cocktail which is not sweet and strong. I don't remember the name or never asked but cocktail was AWESOME. Bartender had a great attitude and everyone seem friendly. Food & service on point and above expectations. Definitely, would be returning for some more. I would highly recommend this place if you looking for tasty food, strong flavorful cocktail and great service!",

Been there twice in the two weeks they have been open and I would recommend \"the treatment\" they roll out a bunch of different features of the menu to provide a melody of holy goodness. I am talking everything from oysters, homemade pasta, gnocchi, duck, quail, steak, you name it they do it, and do it well!! Don't forget the final course is dessert. I would personally recommend the cheesecake.   If you want to make it saucy, get a wine tasting/whole glass with each course they bring, it will make the experience all the more amazing.

    "text": "While I haven't written any reviews in a little while, my visit to Fin & Fino has inspired me. I knew that they were opening sometime soon but I needed a hot tip from a friend last Saturday to know that they were opening essentially last weekend. Now the wife and I love all things seafood, so we were excited to try it all. Well her lobster allergy precludes her from trying all but Fin & Fino was very accommodating.  The menu is a little overwhelming with almost too many dishes to count to go along with dare I say the largest oyster list in the city. We both love raw oysters so we decided on 4 different varieties of north east oysters. We liked them salty and briny and they were. We followed those with some salmon and tuna poke which was well done with balanced flavors showcasing the fishies. Now for the next choices our server helped us and suggested that we do another small plate and share an entree. We obliged and agreed upon the scallops and latke, more on those later and the monkfish entree which while it came with a lobster sauce, they were able to plate the dish with the sauce on the side to avoid any need for an epipen, cause those are expensive, or a visit to the ER, cause that's even more expensive. The monkfish was cooked well and the tomatoes and kale were great accompaniments. Now onto the scallops and latkes. This was hands down my favorite dish of the night, while the wife may have another ultimate favorite we both agreed that the scallops/latkes were Charleston great. Trust us that's a thing. I try hard at home to cook scallops properly, sometimes they turn out better than others, but these scallops were probably the best I can remember. And the pairing of the scallops with the latkes along with the sour cream and lemon curd, at least I thought it was lemon curd was over the top. In fact when it came to dessert, we both decided to forgo the sweets and order each another small plate. The wife got the buckwheat pasta with shrimp and I, well I got another order of those scallops...  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the drinks and the bar. While we didn't hang out at the bar at all, it looks very well laid out and the drinks that we had were interesting and delicious. If you trust the bartender, try their \"waiting for magic\" offering which changes daily with unknown ingredients or get a drink off the menu or even go off menu, they will make you something good. They also have an extensive wine list if that's more your thing. The wife and I will be regulars, and they will be offering lunch as well as happy time from 4-6, which our server mentioned to us is still a work in progress on the full details. The price point is elevated a little, but if you don't like raw oysters and drink less than we do, you will be fine.",

The scallop was perfectly seared with a salty crust, and came with a sweet puree and sour cream to bring a little creaminess and sweetness to the dish. The baked oysters were a close second. Also loved the olive oil pound cake - very lemony and just the right amount of denseness, accompanied by ice cream and whipped cream. The service was impeccable.",

    "text": "High hopes for Fin & Fino and, for the most part, it didn't disappoint.   Love the space and the build out-very tastefully done with lots of blue hues- nautical theme but not in a kitschy way.  Bar is very cool as well- good spot to saddle up for a drink and some small plates.   One rub is that with the open floor plan the decibel level is pretty high. Was difficult to hear anyone but the person next to you (we had a party of six) and dining room was only half full. Buyer beware. However, they were playing cool tunes from the 90's so that took the edge off..  On to the food. Some hits, some misses. Fried oysters were fantastic-great texture and perfectly cooked. Same with the Bahn Mi shrimp- great balance of heat and cool and a good mix of fresh veggie crunch that defines that sandwich. Mussels were a big hit as well- everyone was gaga over the broth and we needed extra orders of bread to sop up every last drop. Hanger steak was very good as well. Worth an order.   Now some of the clunkers... calamari was a bit bland and over cooked however will admit that we asked for it \"naked\" so the aioli may have saved it. Smoked salmon flatbread was bland- arugula salad on top needed some seasoning but that may not have salvaged it. Just blah. Grilled oysters were also flavorless- needed salt badly and the heat from the japs was lost in kind of a pool of nothingness. Faroe Island Salmon was steady but a bit over cooked on both our orders (which is a shame b/c that salmon is so damn good medium rare).  Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. A bit slow at times but not an issue at all.   Would certainly return and is a refreshing addition to the Charlotte dining scene.",

I sat without a drink for 15 minutes, while he was just standing around talking to co workers. unfortunate when you can't get good service and food on a weeknight. maybe this place puts more care and attention into everything on the weekends. at least I would hope.

The staff is  knowledgeable about the menu. I also appreciated the fact that on a busy Saturday night, they had a well staffed bar where you never had a wait. (Take note other restaurants, 5 bartenders is definitely how you do it!)  As someone who was finishing Whole30 and ventured out anyway, the staff was kind and unbothered by my 15 questions. They made me several fantastic sugar free mocktails and didn't complain about the hassle. Very great experience!",

We had read the reviews about the food and had high expectations going into the meal. We both really liked the food, but the scallops, shrimp, and mahi mahi were all a little spicy for our taste. They had run out of the berry crisp for dessert, so we got the cheesecake which was perfectly light and whipped. We also got the olive oil cake which was similar to strawberry shortcake, with pecan brittle and pickled strawberries. Dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal.",

Boy, am I glad I listened to him!!    Fin & Fino is instantly one of my new favorite Charlotte restaurants!  EVERYTHING we tasted was amazing.  I absolutely love the concept of the small plates to share.  It's not exactly \"tapas\", but it is in the spirit of tapas.  Take my advice and try several different items.  My favorite was the scallop and latke dish.  I am going to have to get back to Charlotte quickly just to have that again.  If you love scallops, these are the most unique scallops you will ever eat and the presentation is phenomenal.    Our service was absolutely impeccable.  We never needed anything as everyone anticipated our needs very well and our server was as professional as it gets.  The restaurant is tastefully-decorated and, seriously, the bathroom soap was INCREDIBLE!  I know, right?  Soap??  They use a local company called Whispering Willow and I have already ordered some from their website.  I loved everything about this place.  Enjoy!",

Plenty of non seafood options on the menu but went with the crab cake BLT sandwich as did my guest. It was awesome. The crab cake stayed together nicely when you chomped into it. The bacon the sandwich was a good smokey addition. The BLT comes with a side apple salad which also has a little bacon it which made the salad. Perfect size for lunch.

We had a great server, and service was excellent.  We started off with drinks, a few wine orders, cocktails and I went with the Cee-Lo Green.  It was described as some sort of chef's choice punch served in a fun glass.  Sounds great to me!  First glass came out and the punch had a coconut taste in a tiki glass.  Awesome.  Then we ordered a few apps - 12 choice oysters and an order of baked oysters.  All excellent.  The raw oysters were so fresh - it tasted like I had a mouthful of ocean water it was so salty and good.  We all decided to go with 'The Treatment'.  If you go here, do this!  Described as a tasting tour of the menu, we told our server that one of our guests can't have scallops, no raw items, etc.  For the next 2 hours we received food non-stop.  Red snapper, salmon, bone in NY Strip, scallops, shrimp, lobster pasta.  Every plate was excellent and when we thought it was over, more plates arrived.  Then there was the dessert course.  Cheesecake, chocolate tart and olive oil soaked pieces of cake with mascerated strawberries on top.  Overall great experience.",

My reason for the 2 stars is service. It was horrible! Our server's name was Boston. When we sat down it took her a while to come get our drinks. She was not friendly at all. She never introduced herself. She didn't explain the menu. She didn't seem familiar with the menu. When we asked for suggestions she basically said everything was good. She told us the portions were small tapas style but they were actually big enough for entrees. Needless to say we ordered too much food. All other staff were friendly. I expected a lot more for a $300 meal. Not likely to return.",

My only regret is that we weren't hungry enough to do \"the treatment\" which is where you pay $50 per person and your server customizes a menu for your table. We ended up just getting a few small plates each and everything we tried was amazing. The scallops were fantastic and the poke bowl was delicious and surprisingly big! My friend decided to order the hanger steak, which we all poke fun at because it's a seafood restaurant, but it turned out to be incredible and one of the best things we tried! The tagliatelle was also very good and they give you a very big portion. Overall, we liked everything we tried! I was pleasantly surprised at the portion sizes because small plates tend to be tricky and sometimes end up being way too small. They also have an extensive wine list, but it's a tad confusing because it's grouped by what the wine will pair with and not the type of wine, so it's hard to tell what is red vs white, etc.  Overall, we really liked this place and definitely want to come back and to \"the treatment\"!",

    "text": "After being an anonymous yelp user for the past 10 years I just had to come and do my first (and probably last) review. This place is amazing!   I was in town for business and really wanted seafood. Tyler, my waiter, spent time not only reviewing the menu but the dishes with best flavors. He told me to skip salad items. Im glad I listened.  I ordered the lobster and truffles and the Tile fish. The basil pasta, lobster, and truffle cream sauce in the lobster dish was so good that I saved a little bit as my last bite. I wanted it to be the last thing I tasted and remembered.   The Tile fish flavors were also great. It comes in a saffron broth with the charred corn, yellow sweet tomatoes and what i thought was jalapenos but was actually okra. Im not usually an okra fan but it is thinly sliced and works well with the dish.   I was surprised when the manager, Natalie, came by to ask how my meal was and later offered me complimentary dessert. I definitely appreciate the attentiveness shown.   I already recommended this place to 2 of my traveling colleagues. Im so jealous of all the locals who will get to enjoy this place whenever they want. Thank you Tyler, Natalie, and Fin and Fino for one of the most enjoyable meals and dining experiences I've ever had!   P.S There's an off menu item with butternut squash, mushrooms, and chicharrones, if i had room for more I would've gotten it. Ask about it!",

    "text": "Fin and Fino had a few wins but overall a disappointing experience. The major issue is with regards to how they handled my food allergies; I was assured that all dishes I was served did would not include those items I'm allergic to. Five minutes after leaving the restaurant I knew hat wasn't the case and had a severe allergic reaction. Trusting that a restaurant is aware of the ingredients it's serving and is taking your health seriously is critically important. I'm not sure why this restaurant served me a dish with ingredients that I'm allergic to but it's unacceptable for any restaurant to do so.   Besides my allergy issue overall the interior/atmosphere is trendy and energetic. Wine list has some interesting bottles. Our server was attentive and seemed knowledgeable (I'm chalking the allergy issue to the kitchen, not her). The food was really the problem here. My husband was disappointed in his dishes, particularly the salmon flatbread and lobster and truffle; the flavors of truffle and salmon were lost in the other ingredients. I was served over cooked PEI mussels, half of which were inedible; because the dish was inedible they didn't charge me for it which I appreciated but the dish should never have been served. The fried oysters and beet salad were good, solid but nothing amazing.  I hope that Fin and Fino better accommodates those with food allergies going forward and focuses on improving the quality of its food. It has everything else going for it but due to the food experience we likely won't go back.",

The drinks, which are all pirate themed, were awesome, expertly described and made very well.  Food wise: West coast oysters were on a Queens feast deal $2/oyster so we tried that---next time probably just pick our own specific ones Angel oysters---absolutely amazing and a must try Lobster with the shells and basil---again delicious, but there were no truffles on our dish Scallops and latkes---DEFINITELY recommend, great flavor and texture combinations Tilefish---good combo, but ours was a liiiiiitle under cooked/raw in the middle but we ate around it and was fine Of course, this being under the Dressler family of restaurants, we got a piece of cheesecake for dessert and left absolutely satisfied.

I have never ordered a cheese plate st a restaurant before, but it was awesome! Pear chutney, apple butter, pomegranate/beet combo along with walnuts/bread and various cheeses-delicious! The oysters were awesome with bacon, leeks, cheese...amazing! The Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked with bacon and some kind of glaze that any Brussels sprout lover would like. The poke bowl was more than enough to fill one person! Super tasty & the jalapenos on it were the best! I think they were candied...amazing!

    "text": "First time in Charlotte, here on business.  If it weren't for the tasteful interior design and crisp nautical color palette, I'd be giving this place a half-star.  By 7:30pm, middle of dinner service, they were already sold out of the most appetizing thing I read on the menu: lobster & truffles with basil shells.  It was the main reason I'd decided to try this place-having checked out the menu beforehand.  Ok fine, hot new restaurants sometimes don't plan well enough and sell out of their most popular dish.  So I changed up and decided to try the calamari and cauliflower gratin.  The calamari was a disaster.  Something about that hoisin-chili sauce it was cooked in  just didn't work.  And I can usually enjoy any type of calamari no matter how it's seasoned by different establishments but this I just couldn't.  I sent it back after two bites.  I decided to remain positive about the cauliflower and waited for that to come out and then I ordered the monkfish as my protein replacement of the calamari.  They both came out at the same time and neither impressed.  The monkfish was completely over-cooked and both dishes were so salty I can feel my body retaining water as it breaks down all the salt from that food.  I didn't finish either dish.  As a saving grace, Fin and Fino did send me home with a complimentary cheesecake since I didn't really enjoy my dining experience.  That's a nice gesture, it honestly boosts my view of their customer service-which is always appreciated...I just have no faith I'm going to enjoy it at this point. #saltychicagoan #literallysaltyfromsaltyfood",

I am typically not a raw oyster person but, the variety of the menu makes you excited to try new things all around! My service was immaculate! I felt that my server was ahead of the game! Every time I thought about needing something, he'd already put it on my table! In fact the service staff was attentive as a whole. They all seemed to be fully aware even of the tables around me. One thing that did throw me off was the huge contrast in uniforms between the servers and the bartenders. While they are all a nice-looking bunch, the bartenders wear a very fun denim outfit that looks carefree and comfortable. The servers however, wear white uniform shirts with aprons almost to the floor! It doesn't match the fun environment well. They just look uncomfortable in comparison but other than that (which is the absolute worst I can say) this place rocks and I'll be back as quickly as I can be!",

I had my young daughter with me and they made her a special meal since they didn't have a kids menu. It was grilled chicken breast with fries and fruit. It was very, very tasty and I actually liked it better than my own meal. My mom and I split an appetizer with was the Bahn mi shrimp. I love Vietnamese food so was very excited to try it. Unfortunate it just lacked those flavors that make a bahn mi so good. I just got a salad for my meal with was good enough but really nothing to write home about. My mom got the veggie pasta with shrimp and that too was just ok.  The real star of the show here was there wine selection. They have so many great wines to choose from. I did a wine sampler and I thought each wine was better than the last. I will be back again just to enjoy there wines but I'll probably pass on the food other than the occasional appetizer.",

As far as the food goes, the oyster selection is to die for! We started with a couple of the Towers of Power, which were delicious! My absolute favorite dish of the night was the Angel Oysters (I can not recommend these enough!).  By the end of the meal we had tried over half of the menu. Everything was absolutely wonderful!  The only thing that wasn't exceptional was the lobster pasta dish, which wasn't bad, just very bland and not worth the price. Everyone in our group had a great time here! Cant wait to go back!",

All of them are delicious. 2. Plates to share - most part of the menu is tapa style dish, so it is great to share with friends. 3. Friendly and helpful service. 4. Desserts are good add-on after all the seafood. Cheesecake is unique and tasty.  Cons: The only thing I found inconvenient is that the valet parking service does not start until 6pm on weekdays. Before 6pm, you can choose to park in front of the restaurant and give your keys to the front desk (then valet will park your car later), or just park in Duke Energy building ($5 after 5pm).  As for appetizer, I would recommend the tuna poke.",

It took a little longer to get our food, especially our last two dishes, but all's well that ends well I suppose.   We ordered a couple of different oysters. I wish I could remember which ones so I could recommend them because they were delicious. We also did a beet salad and calamari, both of which were great! Our last two dishes, which oddly enough took the longest to come out, fell flat. It was the tilefish and grouper (which was the special). Both dishes were way over seasoned, we couldn't even finish them.   Still, the overall experience was pleasant, and we are excited to go back and try some more stuff. I also want to give it a try for lunch since I work just a few blocks away. Oh! And try the pineapple infused brandy! We got a small sip with our meal and it was really good.",

Service was great at the bar (dining by myself so didn't mind sitting there).  There is an extensive IPA and cocktail list.  Cute concoction with a pirate theme in the name.  I went for the Booty.  Delicious.  From the restaurant week menu I selected Pork Belly to start (which is a special item that is not usually on menu), the Mahi Mahi with corn soubise and chocolate panda cotta for dessert.  I also took advantage of the special offer of $2 oysters and got a Shipwreck and a Miyagi.  Both were very fresh and creamy.  While service was very friendly it did take some time before the rest of the food arrived.  Pork belly as moist and flavorful beautifully presented.  It is just a touch off from being melt in your mouth but it was tasty so I am alright with that.  The Mahi Mahi was fresh but over salted (to the point I really couldn't enjoy it).  The bar staff was great - took care of it for me and let me reselect my main.  The Sea Scallop with andouille & maque choux redeemed it for me.  Big juicy scallops seared and seasoned perfectly.  I had chocolate panda cotta and hit the spot for me.    I would come back and try different things again if I had the chance.",

At the first glance of the menu I noticed that there weren't any simple dishes and I am a simple lady. Everything seemed overly complicated but I am sure that is the purpose of the restaurant...differentiation from others. I ordered the tomato bisque and squash soup along with the salmon.

    "text": "The Dressler family... and not merely those folks that are blood related to John and Kim Dressler, who spearhead Rare Roots Hospitality (yes, I had such a good experience last night that I looked them up - and we were also fortunate to meet and chat with the very amiable John), but all those who are part of their familial-feeling company are all enthusiastic, professional, knowledgeable and better than all that, make you feel like part of the family as well while you are in one of their establishments. There are a lot of great restaurants and eateries in and around the Queen City; some are great most of the time, some are great on one thing but miss the mark just a bit on another, but rarely do you find a restaurant where every part of your experience is on pointe - from the service to the space to the offerings, the innovation in uniquely crafted cocktails and thoughtfully prepared plates that make you excited to venture out of your 'comfort zone' - every SINGLE time.  The Dressler's have found and kept talented, engaging people in all levels of their staff or 'extended family' so much so that nothing ever gets overlooked and exceptional is the norm.  You just don't find it done better than this - not even in New York, LA or Chicago. As you may have guessed, I am a fan of other Dressler ventures - love Dogwood Southern Table in Southpark and recommended Dressler's to a colleague who raved about his evening. I should have known the experience would be no less but completely different at Fin and Fino - a bright star tucked beneath the Q.C. Skyline. Our server Andrew (and I honestly hesitate to call these folks servers as titles can be misleading depending on where you work; these professionals are not the same level of staff that you might find at your local wing place or watering hole) was so adept (as they always are at a Dressler's establishment) at recommendations, noting our individual preferences and palates, that it would be hard to adequately describe the scents, tastes and sensations of the meal that we enjoyed last night.  Suffice it to say, there is something for everyone, and everyone will feel welcome and at home. Without describing each dish or cocktail (try their sherries, you will be delighted and may find a new hobby!) I will just briefly note that the extensive list of oysters, the creative small plates and unique spirits were all memorable in their own right but were an epicurean symphony together. Make a reservation - you don't want to miss Fin & Fino.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here on Saturday for a date night. The first thing I noticed was how gorgeous it was inside! The space is well designed and super appealing.  We sat down and immediately decided on the Treatment. $55 per person and $5 goes to charity. They bring out a sampling of things on the menu. Additionally, we decided on a bottle of wine. We found out that the wine we selected was out of stock but the waitress handled it well by suggesting something comparable and bringing us a tasting of it.   Side note: I thought they handled my husbands oyster allergy (yes, just oysters...it's odd) really well and were super conscience of it.   As for the food.....absolutely delish. It just kept coming and coming. Here is what was brought out for The Treatment: -Oysters- For me. I got two and I loved being able to compare the flavor profile -Bahn Mi Shrimp- Nice sized and flavorful -Salmon and Tuna poke bowl- The rice had a great texture and the tuna was so good -Mussels- The sauce was insanely good. They even brought out extra bread for us to soak up the amazing sauce.  -Fried Calamari- This was the only miss for me for the whole night. I felt like the breading was just a bit too thick so all you tasted was fried-ness -Scallops- The latke underneath was a nice touch. So flavorful and perfectly cooked -NC Trout- Probably my favorite of the evening. Squid ink pasta....need I say more.  -Tilefish- The saffron aioli was so tasty. This was another winner! -Cheesecake- So light and fluffy -Brownie- The cherry filling was not too overpowering which made this perfect combo of flavor and texture.   I cant wait to come back just to try the Lobster and Truffles!  I think my only complaint was that the portions were huge. For The Treatment, I wished they served a bit smaller size since we were getting so many. However, now that I am typing this, I feel like I sound ridiculous!!   Service was absolutely flawless. I truly haven't been so happy after a meal in a long time. This place is the real deal.",

    "text": "I've been to Fin and Fino (F&F) three times now and as someone who's been to every seafood spot in CLT, I can say this might be the top seafood restaurant in Charlotte.  Here's why Fin & Fino might be the best in the Queen City...  Ambiance:  In the sake of full disclosure, I should mention I've only sat at the bar @ F&F.  Its usually not crowded and one can usually find an unoccupied spot or two at the spacious bar without any issue.  The open feel of Fin & Fino is really inviting.  The white tablecloths help to create a more upscale, classy feel for sure.     Food:  Every foof item I have sampled at F&F has been super tasty, and prepared with attention to the colors and appearance of the food on the plate.  The calamari, though slight different with the radishes was awesome!   The hanger with the kale and beets was also a variation on your standard hanger steak, but was excellent as well.  The PEI Mussels are a must as well - I would order the mussels simply for the buttery broth they are served with!  Just like the rest of the items, you don't get a big portion, the colors jump right out at you but the smell and taste are too inviting to resist.    Service:  The service has always been excellent.  As mentioned earlier, I've been here three times and do not have a single complaint about the service.  Everyone has always been super friendly.  I can't imagine you having any issues with the service (although as stated, I've only eaten at the bar while dining here).  Parking:  They have complementary valet parking, otherwise Uber.  If you like seafood and you haven't been to Fin & Fino, I've got to say you are def missing out on what may indeed be the best seafood spot in all of Charlotte.",

    "text": "Fin & Fino is a fun spot to come and grab some food, particularly for anyone working in downtown Charlotte - it seemed quite popular on a weeknight for folks to stop by and grab some food and (more popularly) drinks. It's got a pretty casual vibe to it nonetheless, with a bar to the right as you go in and some high-top tables to the left. There's also a dining room further back as you go in, but we ended up sticking to the front while we were there. The service at the bar is pretty straightforward and attentive, but I did feel that after we moved to a high-top table, it took a little longer for the waiter to check on us, particularly on the beverage front. The food, however, came out in a much quicker and orderly fashion.  Overall, I'd say that I probably liked the food better than the drinks; the house cocktails were okay, if a bit on the simplified side, i.e. it didn't have the same kind of depth to the beverages that you'd find at a cocktail lounge. Nonetheless, they were still solid, and I was more impressed by the beer selection, which is pretty broad and has a solid selection of local brews as well. The food here is a little more skewed towards the seafood, but I really enjoyed everything I ate here. The oysters - whether raw or grilled - are quite good, with a nice geographic selection to choose from if you go the raw route. I also quite liked the steak that was on the menu here; it was served sliced up and cooked to a really nice medium-rare with a lot of flavor.  With a wide-ranging menu of food that's done well without trying to be overly complicated, Fin & Fino is a nice spot to come for a quick drink, some bites, or a full-blown meal. Given its accessibility to the heart of Charlotte, it'd definitely be a place I wouldn't mind coming back to next time I am in town.",

This location used to be E3 and I mourned the loss of the lavender foam drink I used to have there when it closed, but Fin & Fino is a very welcome alternative with custom cocktails that display bartender skills beyond your everyday stir and shake.  I loved the drink I had and I wish I could tell you what it was, but they made it for me based on my tastes and I had no idea other than it was pretty deadly, pretty and deadly. YUM!  I can tell you, once they brought it to me, everyone else at the table wanted one. It was so good!  Chris is the best server in the place! Loved how he teased my friend about her eyebrows - that added some entertainment to go with the fantastic food.",

We asked the server for \"The Treatment\" -- and what a great decision for our first time at Fin & Fino.  The dishes (all small plate/tapas) began arriving!  We had grilled oysters - the smokiness was outstanding, scallops on latkes, lobster gnocchi, mussels, tuna and salmon poke, fried calamari and finished the evening with a cheese plate (we requested no sweets).  Everything we had was delicious - the standouts were the scallops, mussels and poke.    The Treatment is $55/person - essentially, your server is selecting a number of items that fit within the price range of what you are spending - 2 people = approximately $110 worth of food.  I would recommend The Treatment for your first trip - but, next time I will just select a number of plates on my own.  Service was outstanding.  The venue is clean and white (if a bit sterile feeling).",

In a city with a dearth of seafood spots this one not only gets it right with the food but also with the atmosphere, service and overall experience.   Our waiter at dinner was nothing short of superb. He quickly got the idea we were in a playful mood and played right along, making it a fun evening but still provided spot-on and professional service. His recommendations proved reliable. We ordered The Treatment and our waiter did custom wine pairings for us. Not just for the table. He customized the wine pairings based on each person's individual preferences. That's some good stuff, right?  Went back for lunch on a hot day and the AC was really struggling. They need to address that. With that said, the Poke Bowl was far superior to any I have gotten anywhere else in town. Great flavor, texture and reasonably priced.   They also have a great bar and craft cocktail menu.   This is the latest concept from the Dressler restaurant group and I think it may be their best yet.",

    "text": "Another in a long list of places I've been wanting to try but haven't gotten to previously.  Fortunately a work team dinner paved the way to finally try Fin & Fino.  Outstanding is the first word that comes to mind after the experience.  First off, any place that serves a lot of small plates automatically gets off on a good foot with me as I love variety in most all things but particularly when it comes to food.  Now, that is just the first step and if the small plates don't deliver, well...  Fin & Fino delivered and then some.  The beauty of a dinner with a team you're very close with is, sharing!  I was able to sample not only what I ordered but a bunch of other items as well.  Plus, a seafood tower was ordered for the table and just happened to land right in front of me which did not suck at all.  I ate, I shared, it was heaven.  The tower featured chilled oysters, mussels, shrimp, crab claws, salmon/tuna poke and lobster and it was all fresh and just delicious.  The cocktail sauce that came along with it was potent to say the least and I'm a lover of that horseradish kick.  Other things I was able to sample... BBQ quail, hot mussels with yummy broth, mahi, other kinds of raw oysters than what came on the tower, creamed crab and oysters (hot dish) and gnocchi.  It was all well prepared with the last two dishes listed being good but not as great as everything else.  Service from the middle of the table to my right seemed to be great but I heard the next day there were some issues at the other end of the table including hints of condescension coming from the server when some wine was sent back.  I didn't see or hear so not first hand but, I trust the sources.  End of the day, I came home raving about F&F to my wife and can't wait till we go back.  Thank you to the Dressler family for another CLT restaurant winner!",

They even have little sauce injectors with different hot sauce anywhere from sweet to spicy which I think is brilliant! We ended up get the 2 tiered seafood platter as well omg wow! Everything was fresh and to die for! The Rose was at a perfect temp and they had a great selection of wines! Truly a remarkable place! It is very pricey but well worth it this is why I would call it a special occasion or holiday place unless you can afford a $500 bill every night or week if I could I'd be there a few times a week absolutely worth every penny!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  My husband and I visited Fin & Fino for the first time recently to celebrate our anniversary.  We live close to Dressler's in Huntersville, and it's become one of our favorite spots for fine dining.  We had hoped to have a similar experience at Fin & Fino.  It was close, but not quite.  We each had three dishes - two sides, and four \"entrees.\"  As this is tapas-style, your dishes will come out as soon as they are ready.  We started with the blistered tomatoes.  Honestly, this was my favorite dish of the night.  The tomatoes were cooked perfectly, and the dish had a good quantity of melted mozzarella and fabulous homemade gnocchi.     Next, came the scallops & latke and the lobster & truffles.  We preferred the scallops over the lobster.  The scallops and latkes were perfectly cooked (the latkes a little crispy), and the creme fraiche sauce was a nice complement.  The lobster was served with basil shells in a cream sauce.  The salty cream sauce drowned out much of the flavor of the small bits of lobster, and I couldn't taste the truffles at all.    Next, we received the wagyu skirt steak, shrimp with buckwheat tagliatelle, and cauliflower au gratin.  The wagyu was the biggest disappointment.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare, but had almost no flavor.  The shrimp tagliatelle was the most generous portion.  I really liked the light sauce, but the pasta was a bit overcooked.  The cauliflower was very good, but heavy with the cream sauce, and a bit salty.  We both had cocktails - I had the Good Sister (I think that was the name), and my husband had the #9.  They were good, but pricey.    Service was the star here.  Our server was very helpful and attentive, and we never wanted for anything.    Would we return?  Maybe, when they change the menu.  We had several very good dishes, but overall, I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped I'd be.",

Justin didn't have high expectations walking in, but something inside of me did, and we both left so thrilled with our experience from start to finish.  We weren't able to get reservations since we were last minute walking home and decided to pop in for dinner, which was fine, because the bar was perfect for us and it was totally meant to be because Rebecca, the bartender, was knowledgeable, kind, soft spoken, attentive, just asked enough questions, and took pride in taking care of her guests. I haven't had service experience like this in a long time and coming from the industry myself, it was so welcomed.  We split the Tower of Power. Looking back, we should have probably done the smaller tower and ordered the hot mussels because J didn't love the cold ones (but I did). We were *slightly* disappointed in the oysters on both taste and size, but over all were very happy.  We are so excited to visit again and try other dishes...and of course, sit at the bar.  The open concept of this space is gorgeous, airy and light. Love the kitchen windows and the cleanliness and the decor. It's the perfect date-night spot on all levels.",

The menu offers a wide variety of seafood all super fresh and flavorful.  I love the open kitchen -the sound and smell is amazing.  I particularly enjoyed the mussels and the wine list.  The shrimp pasta is really good.  The red snapper special with house made gnocchi was amazing!  The service is also top notch.  We had a very minimal wait and for our troubles the manager provided our table a cheese board which was fantastic it even had French salami which was new to me and very delicious. If possible, save room for dessert. This last time I tried and loved the hazelnut creme brulee.   I definitely plan on returning to feast on their yummy seafood creations!!!",

Bartenders were spectacular - friendly and helpful in providing recommendations and crafting cocktails. If you love beer, they have a great craft list with beers I've never seen anywhere else in the city. One notable one was the key lime gose. As the beer started to warm up, you could taste hints of graham cracker. The wine list also looked great! Rebecca was great! She made a point to learn my name for the next time I come in.  Happy hour special 4-6 was Parmesan fries, a burger and one other sandwich item for under $10. All of the plates (for the most part) seemed shareable. You could go with a few friends and split 3-4 different dishes to sample the assortment.  The vibe was a mix of date night, girls night out and business people.",

They have a great cocktail list and the cognac & gin based Doo Wop was more than just a pretty drink; it packed a punch!

It's quite loud in that area and I was happy that our table was towards the back of the restaurant, which was much quieter.   Our server, Devon, was hilarious and so fun. We hit it off with him right away. I was thrilled to see a section of non-alcoholic beverages, but Devon told me about one that wasn't yet listed, which was a strawberry spritzer. That was my choice and it was like summer in a glass. Perfect!   To start, we shared the calamari. It was okay, certainly large enough for sharing but it didn't blow me away. What did blow me away was our shared lobster and truffles dish. WOW. This was so rich and so delicious. A must order.   I will say, the menu is a bit confusing. We were told the plates are meant for sharing but they were all on the fairly large side! We ended up each ordering our own plate and then trying tastes of each other's dishes. I had the tagliatelle with shrimp. This was really good and just what I was craving. My friends were happy with their salmon and octopus dishes.   Everyone was too full for dessert but somehow we convinced ourselves to take desserts to go. And you better believe I was super pumped a couple hours later in my hotel room with my giant slice of cheesecake! Said cheesecake was the final nail in the coffin of gluttony that was my three night trip to Charlotte!",

My co-worker was able to get us a reservation for the evening a few hours in advance and when we arrived the restaurant was very busy with both outdoor and indoor seating. It's located right next to the seesaw art installation right now and made for a lovely walk.  At this point I wasn't really drinking as much so went with one of their non-alcoholic cocktails and it was absolutely delicious and not too pricey. Going to start paying attention to this section of menus more thanks for Fin & Fino. For my entree I decided on the Octopus dish and wow I loved it! I will say that make sure you are a fan of Octopus if you order it, as it comes out a little tender/little tough just like is should be. I also loved the pork shoulder, salad and dipping sauce that it came with.",

For $59, let your server and the chef take you on a tour of the menu. Bonus: $5 goes to charity. If you're thinking that sounds a little too pricey, it's not. You'll want to order several small plates here (tapas style dominates the menu), so it's actually the most cost efficient to do that.  The best thing on the menu is the lobster & truffles. Housemade basil shells, lobster stock, celery root brandade, truffles- you can taste just how much love and work goes into this dish. It's so delicious. I've tried a lot of things on the menu (I'm a big fan of The Treatment), it's all been great. My latest trip here, we weren't hungry enough for a huge meal so we just shared a few things. We got the calamari (the curry coconut dressing on it is very tasty), Buckwheat Tagliatelle, Octopus & Pork Belly, and the faroe Island Salmon. Loved the beet puree with the salmon and the fingerlings were to die for.   Service was amazing, it always is here. It's the same group behind Dresslers, Dogwood Southern and The Porter's House, so I always know it'll be a great experience. I love the decor, atmosphere and vibe. The restaurant opens out onto the patio. The space is clean, white, and bright. Super gorgeous.  They have free valet here (right in front of the restaurant on Levine Avenue of the Arts). There's also the Duke Energy parking deck.",

My entree options included: sirloin, salmon or tagliatelle pasta with added shrimp.   In theory it sounded like an amazing offer, especially for uptown but I will say that the portion sizes were slightly disappointing.   Aside from that, the food and its quality was amazing! I chose the arugula salad with salmon. The salad was fresh and the salmon was cooked to perfection. It also came with potatoes and ground meat.   Pickup was easy, although the restaurant was crowded. They seemed to be having a corporate mixer or gathering. After heading to the bar, my food was ready with compostable silverware included.   All in all, I will definitely be back again! I would not suggest if you are ravishingly hungry but it was enough to satisfy me - and the food was great!",

    "text": "Of all the dining experiences I have had recently, Fin and Fino has topped the list. If you do decide to go order the treatment. It is a wonderful tasting experience where your waiter customizes several courses based on your preferences. I enjoyed the suspense of wondering what dish would come next and we were completely stuffed by the end.  First I must mention that there was a disappoint aspect to the experience. THEY NO LONGER SELL THE DRINK IN A PINEAPPLE. Which I suppose is ultimately a good thing because their bartender completely revamps the beverage menu periodically but I must admit I was a little disappointed.   Our excellent waiter who was prompt and full of warm personality started us off with oysters. My fiance had them raw and I had them cooked. The raw ones came with an impressive assortment of sauces in eye droppers for exact distribution. Then we moved on to the poke bowl, which I could have happily eaten as my entire entree. Delicious sauce, generous fish portion. Several other small plates later we had the fish special of the day accompanied by the beets (outstanding beets) and roasted cauliflower (with bacon, of course). I will say the waiter originally brought us the fried okra which neither of us were big on and when he saw we hadn't eaten much happily swapped it for the much better cauliflower with no prompting. So if something on the tasting isn't to your preference they will swap it out!   Just an all around great experience and we will definitely make the trek from the burbs to the city to return!",

The raw oysters are very fresh and served with house made crackers on request.  The buckwheat tagliatelle was really good (better than the risotto).   The snapper dish was very good also.   For dessert I recommend the strawberry shortcake with toasted/cubed olive oil cake",

We then had a charcuterie board, without cheese like most restaurants, but it still turned out great.   Their lunch special was swordfish on risotto which was amazing!  We also had the steak which was ok, fries that came with it was pretty good! The poke bowl was delightful!  Great place for lunch!",

I understand the idea of tapas but this was poorly executed. The feature on the QF website was extremely misleading because we ended up sharing every course besides the \"entrees\". Only the appetizers were large enough portions for THREE PEOPLE. The vegetable and dessert was literally enough for one person, two if one is a child. I thought maybe we were unlucky for participating in QF. However, I was wrong because no one in our dinner party enjoyed their food. Everything was lacking flavor. The final straw was the QF dessert! It's literally the only picture I took because I could not believe my eyes. Literally 3 of the smallest desserts I've ever seen in my life for THREE grown adults. Absolutely ridiculous. The only good thing this place had to offer was drinks so if you must visit this place, grab food elsewhere first.",

Let me begin by saying that the location is great and the space is wonderful. We went for a special lunch out with some family, which I think is where I went wrong. The menu is completely different for dinner - the lunch menu caters to the working uptown bunch (which 95% of the people were when I went). Not much fin or fino on the lunch menu. I did take a peek at the dinner menu and it seemed a lot more my speed and what I was expecting from the restaurant. I'll certainly have to give it another try at dinner time.   The food was okay, ordered a round of oysters and they were fresh as can be, the mignonettes were outstanding, all done in house. The calamari was a salty...the tomato bisque and the salad were fine. The crab cake sandwich had a little too much bread for my taste, but it had good flavor and consistency. We ordered a risotto and it was tasty but not very creamy and too al dente.   I think the best part of the meal was the service, our server was exceptional and though I think I was having a difficult time with some of the menu items, he was excellent.   Again, will have try to make it to dinner.",

The decor is beautiful.  We were brought waters and ordered drinks.  It took a little while to get our drinks but we were talking so we didn't mind.  Delicious bread was brought out to the table.  Two of us ordered from the restaurant week menu and the others from the regular menu.  The gnocchi was by far the best I have ever had!  The salads were fresh and delicious.  My husband got the oysters and said they were amazing.  For our main courses we had scallops, lamb, and salmon.  The scallops were good but the slaw didn't taste good with the dish.  I would order it again with no slaw.  The salmon and lamb was delicious.    For dessert we had the cheerwine pound cake and brownie.  The staff brought our desserts to the wrong table and let them sit for 5 minutes and then talked about it in front of us, grabbed them and put them on our table.  I asked to get new ones from the back and the whole thing was bizzare.  It took about 30 minutes to get new ones.  No one apologized.  This is the only reason I didn't give fin and fino 5 stars.    We will be back again for sure and hopefully will have a smoother ending to the night.",

The restaurant is beautiful, done in light colors; not a dimly lit joint with heavy decor.  I ordered the mussels as many of my Yelp pals suggested.  Excellent smoky flavor and softly steamed meat.  Well done.  Interestingly, as others have noted, their calamari misses the mark in different ways.  For us, they were very salty and overcooked with just a smidge of smoked aji aoli.  Disappointed.  We would return considering F&F a welcomed restaurant in Uptown.  I say \"give 'em a whirl\" and decide for yourself.",

I knew it would be good since it falls under the same umbrella of restaurants as Dresslers, and I love that their specialty is seafood. The service was fabulous and every meal and drink was delicious. We chose to have the bartenders surprise us/make our own cocktails based on our preferences ($15/each), and though it's a steep price, they were right on, although mine could have used more ginger beer :)  It's a small plate atmosphere/tapas style so plan on ordering multiple plates. Better yet, go with a group so you can try multiple things. We started with the beet greens salad and calamari. The calamari was very unique and different from any other calamari dish I've had, the curry-coconut dressing was a major hit and win in my book. I also liked the daikon and pickled carrots and cilantro additions. We went with one of the seasonal pasta specials, which was also delicious. I would also recommend the mussels if you like those as well. Overall, delicious food, quick service and wonderful and romantic setting. Will be back!",

The salmon was so salty, that we had to send it back. I hate doing that, but I just couldn't eat it. The staff was super nice about it and brought another one very quickly and it was indeed better.

Chef's choice and a range of options. It was enough for two, and then some. Icing on the cake is that dessert is included. Hands down one of the best new places we've tried. I also love that their cocktails are inspired by 90's music. Beautiful decor, moderately upscale feel, without the fuss.",

We tried \"the treatment\" which is an interactive pre fixed designed by your waiter. With a great and interesting conversation about tastes and preferences our server Chris curated and amazing meal with more plates than I could count. The scallops were the best I have ever tried and the mussels beat that. Our waiter was the far and away the highlight of the dinner, he knew the menu in and out making selections that impressed the entire table. If you're looking for a dinner you'll remember please try Fin & Fino (and ask for Chris).",

The server pushed 'The Treatment' for dinner and said it would be a way to taste different items and they would bring more of the items we liked. We received a lot of food, some we liked and others we would've never ordered. The server never came back to ask if there were items we would like again. Total for The Treatment Option was $220 and if we would've just paid for the food brought to the table we would've only paid $174.  So, we lost $46 plus the added tax and tip gratuity. Total the table spent around $400 for food and drinks.  Lobster truffles, smoked salmon, poke bowl, and Moms Cheesecake was delicious!  I love scallops but they were salty. The other items were ok. The restaurant is beautiful and makes you feel like you're at the beach!",

We were left standing for 5 minutes until we were seated.  No one came to greet us until one of the host came over with water after another 10 minutes saying our waiter will arrive shortly. Not impressed with how I was treated because they are known for their \"service\".  We ordered grilled shrimp and baked oysters and both were delicious. However, our flank steak was overly charred and bitter. Risotto was undercooked and salty. Overall we're not overtly impressed with this place which was a huge disappointment.",

It was right across the street from the Knight Theatre where I planned to see one of my favorite bands, Hiroshima.  I had some time to kill before the show so it was perfect. My male server at the bar was attentive, courteous, and helped with my menu selections.  The food was good.  Of my three selections, grilled shrimp, oysters, & shrimp flat bread, the grilled shrimp was my favorite.  As I prepared to leave, I had a major nose bleed.  I was so shocked!  I can't ever remember having one as an adult!  The look on the server's face as he noticed what was happening was priceless!  He hurriedly passed me a number of towels, then stepped way back!  A customer, Jeannetta (a friend of an off duty employee), who was also seated at the bar, helped me to the bathroom.  Right behind her was another server Rebecca who stayed with me, while another server came in with advice & gauze.  Jeannetta, who had left the bathroom came back with more information on nose bleeds.  As I got it together & prepared to leave Jeannetta walked me to the door.  I looked over toward the bar & the male server waved goodbye! He made me smile!  Thanks so much to Rebecca & her co-workers for looking after me. I thank God that kindness still works in America!!  Fin & Fino has some top notch folks working for their business!  Customers too!  Thanks Jeannetta!!  Fin & Fino, I'll be back!!  Finally, the show was great!  Classic!  Hirsoshima has been in the business for 40 yrs and still going strong!",

    "text": "By far the best server I've had in a while, and I know a some of the crew from Dresslers/Porters House (and those guys are always great), however, the food left a little to be desired. Best dish of the night was the grilled oysters with bacon and jalapeno. Worst dish of the night was a neutral split between the duck and the fried oysters.   The cheese plate (since we were ordering to split between 2-4 people for each dish) had enough bread for one of the cheeses only, and to be 100% honest, I expected better cheeses.....it was a very boring medley of blue, manchego and cheddar.   The shrimp bahn mi was a disappointment as well. Expected a True bahn mi style dish.....I understand the deconstructed(ish) approach, but with something quintessentially bread based, it needs to have some kind of component that relatively mimics the name. Or just simply change the name to Vietnamese style shrimp.  The chilled lobster tail was okay...not great. Just a plain jane, cooked lobster tail....with nothing on it.   The two constructive criticisms on the two worst dishes. Just lose the fried oysters.....the oysters you have are great....I suspect that the oysters you're frying are an exceptional way to get rid of the dated ones. Unfortunately, it kinda tastes that way too.....like the dish was an after thought.  The duck.....most places in Charlotte have a similar problem cooking their duck. The fat cap isn't scored, and the fat isn't slowly rendered off.....leaving a giant jiggle of fat under the seared bit. Not appetizing, and the rest of the dish was exceptionally bland.   Having said that, the calamari was stellar. The beet salad was good too. Would give it a second go at some point to check it out again. The good items were VERY good.....",

    "text": "Last night we were served what I would have to call one of the most amazing, innovative, and delicious meals that I have ever experienced! The service was sublime! The food was unique and exciting! And the atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and enjoyable! We started with a monstrous platter of oyster shooters which my nephew declared as \"creamy and buttery\", LOBSTER & TRUFFLES with basil shells, pasta cooked perfectly al dente with a hint of shaved truffle was to die for, a bowl of mussels in a broth that we were soaking up with a wonderfully crunchy grilled bread, and an andouille and blistered tomato flatbread perfect for those of us who needed something other than the shellfish! We then ordered a smorgasbord of delights including the GRILLED BANH MI SHRIMP, SALMON & TUNA POKE bowl that comes with sushi rice, pickled jalapeno, and greens. The fried CALAMARI with smoked aji aioli, pickled peaches, and herbs was perfectly cooked with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy sauce drizzled on the plate to drag through. The STUFFED QUAIL was stuffed with andouille bread pudding, shishito, foraged mushrooms which melted in your mouth. We doubled up on the SCALLOPS & LATKE as suggested by our very knowledgeable and extremely attentive waiter so that everyone in our party who wanted had their own portion. It was well worth it!  We enjoyed the  HANGER STEAK served over creamed leeks, zucchini, and pickled red onion and the FRIED OYSTERS were a sweet surprise! Lightly breaded and golden brown, one bite full of flavor. The HARMONY RIDGE DUCK BREAST with smashed potatoes finished off our own selections, again perfectly cooked to a medium as asked, juicy and tender.  As if that wasn't enough, our ever ready waiter suggested that we sample a newly created dish that he felt was often overlooked on a menu with so much to offer and a taste treat not to be missed! The GRILLED TUNA in a dashi broth, with eggplant, smoked tomatoes, fried parsnips. He was correct! It  was sushi grade tuna perfectly cooked and the dashi broth was full flavored and briny. The pop when you bit into the whole cherry tomatoes gave an acidity that balanced with the oils of the tuna and the crunch of the parsnips enhanced the texture of the dish. Hats off to the wonderful sous chef Kordecki, who we were told created this amazing combination!  A mixed platter of yummy desserts and coffee sealed the deal that we will be coming back for many more adventurous and delicious meals here!",

We ordered cocktails and I got the \"call of the clam\" in which you choose your \"spirit and direction.\" I wound up with a blueberry vodka drink and it was perfect!   We each had three oysters and it was very cool to be able to pick from all kinds of regions. Liked all three.   This place is billed as \"tapas\" but we only ordered two dishes - with the intent of ordering more - and thank goodness we didn't. The two plates were plenty for us. We got the Trout and the Poke bowl and they were phenomenal. We never would have ordered trout if it weren't for Nick's suggestion and it was The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection, to the happiness of my Italian fiance. The pesto on the trout was the perfect balance to the squid ink pasta and we practically licked the plate clean. The poke was just as delicious and the perfect balance of salty and savory flavors. Overall we were to thrilled. Can't wait to come back!!! Thanks, Nick!!",

And nearly everything is served as tapas style so in order to have a full meal, you're ordering 3+ dishes at $13+...just fell flat. We literally ordered 1-2 of everything because the portions were so small. My husband enjoyed the steak as his favorite. For a seafood place I was really disappointed!! The ahi bowl was decent but tiny serving for the price. Flatbread was boring and nothing to remember. The gnocchi had oysters, but again very few! We ordered a dozen raw oysters and 2 of the 4 I had were not good. My favorite, by far was the cauliflower! So if you're a vegetarian go for a light snack/appetizer and get the cauliflower. Otherwise, this is not necessarily a restaurant I would recommend or return to dine again. So sad, because I'm a pescatarian and was hoping to find a new favorite seafood spot!",

    "text": "Our favorite restaurant since moving to the Charlotte area. Fun, eclectic restaurant with drinks as creative as the food items.  Our server, \"Boston\" as her fellow staff members call her, was excellent. She knew the menu well and made the perfect recommendations all evening after asking us the right questions to discover our tastes.  The creativity extends from the bartenders and the drinks they mix all the way through the menu items. We were also amazed how reasonable the prices are for the quality of the food.  Highly recommend!!!!",

All dishes that came out were well presented and flavorful.  Similarly service was attentive and corrected mistakes quickly.  We also sampled many drinks and wines and walked away similarly impressed.  Definitely a spot worth revisiting.",

We had the cauliflower, quail, mussels, lobster pasta, mahi, oysters, and the berry crisp. Each dish was perfectly balanced and flavorful. Our waitress was amazing which made it so much better.",

    "text": "First let me say that I have been wanting to come here since they opened. I was REALLY looking forward to this dinner. As soon as we walked in the door we noticed the low health score of 94. Not what you want to see at a seafood restaurant. The hostesses did not look as polished as you would expect...think hair/clothes/makeup. The ambiance was nice, the service was just ok and the background 80's music has got to go. We came here for Valentines Day with a pre-set menu for $99 per person (drinks not included). The craft beer list is amazing and my cheddar something drink was very good. First our starters came out, the pork belly was good but the squid ink gnocchi was fishy and lacking flavor. They forgot our soup/salad course until we said something. We shouldn't have said anything...could have skipped this course all together. Onion soup was too sweet and salad was nothing special. Next our entrees....I can't believe I am saying this but they literally recycled food/sauces from the starter course. The octopus was mealy, fishy and came with the same kale mixture from the gnocchi and sauce from pork belly. The porchetta was the same piece of meat as the pork belly and came on top of dry lentils. I think the base sauce of the lentils could have been the same as the kale mixture....not sure. We did not bother to eat more than two bites of each meal. We took the desserts to go which ended up in the garbage after we tried them. Overall this was an extremely disappointing experience and we feel cheated to say the least. Our total bill came out to just under $300....this was not money well spent. Charlotte is filled with so many great restaurants, I doubt we will go back. This was not the experience I was expecting to have from Fin & Fino. :(",

    "text": "Great culinary experience!  Had lunch and was mildly disappointed at how thin the lunch menu was. I had looked over their dinner menu last night and was intrigued by about a dozen dinner menu items. The dinner lineup looked so good that I needed to explore Fin & Fino immediately. So, lunch.  Beautiful, uncrowded decor! Service that was friendly and very competent!   Quick note; I don't get the name... Fin and Fino, what does that mean?  For lunch I selected 4 things 1. grilled Bahn Mi shrimp app, which was flat out spectacular. Served six perfectly grilled, decent sized shrimps. Cut these in half and had 12 ideally sized bites. Whatever it is they grill these things over, it gives the shrimp succulent, smoky char-grilled flavor. When you combine the pickled daikon/carrots, sriracha aioli, and popped sorghum onto your fork with a shrimp bite you'll have a nice sized, delicious bite. From start to finish, each bite was a wonderful taste treat! 2. soup of the day was shrimp gumbo. You could tell that this was a long, slow savory journey from cutting board till ending up in my bowl. Marvelous flavor, marvelous kinda-spicy seasoning, marvy aftertaste! 3. unsweet ice tea is something I'm particular about. Boom! Nailed it. brewed just right ... not sitting in a pitcher of melting ice for a long time before I ordered it ... refills were timely and delivered in a fresh glass ... Delicious Southern tea, just normal tasting, made like it's supposed to be, delicious tea! 4. half dozen raw oysters. The oyster menu is hidden in a separate menu that is really the drink menu. I never would have found them if I hadn't asked. The dinner menu is chock full of oysters. The St. Simon ones I had were elegant, sweet, wonderful looking (but undersized) oysters. Killer house-made sauce BTW! Also, Killer house-made crackers!  A re-visit to Fin and Fino for dinner is in my future",
