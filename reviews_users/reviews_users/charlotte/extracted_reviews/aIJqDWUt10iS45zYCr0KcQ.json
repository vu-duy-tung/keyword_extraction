Sometimes we eat in, but more often than not we grab take out and enjoy the yumminess at home.  For years, like many, I would order the Pad Thai.  Once I started branching out, I got hooked.   I've since had the Poh Tok Soup, Gaeng Dang (one of my favorites), Gaeng Panang (my least favorite but still good), Mussumun Curry (awesome), Gaeng Kua Curry, and Pud Met Ma Muang (awesome stir fry).  It's all wonderful.  The staff is also awesome with excellent service and smiling faces!  I love Thai Taste and if you love great Thai food, here's your spot.",

We went at lunch and had trouble parking, when we walked in the restaurant at 1 in the afternoon it was packed-obviously it's popular.  However no one was there to greet us or tell us how long the wait would be.  There were already some people standing by the entrance when we got there waiting to be seated.  After being passed by and ignored a table opened up and the man just waved us over to it.  Maybe it was because they were just super busy but it felt super rushed.  They didn't even ask what we wanted to drink when someone came to our table they just asked if we were ready to order. The lunch menu was really small and I was kinda disappointed cause it didn't have my usual favorite thai curry so I settled for something else (which was still really good). Don't know if we will be back, we have other thai places that are less cramped and way friendlier with food just as yummy.",

Though, when I got my pad thai I was amazed that my 80lb server could carry such a big dish.  DAAAYUUUM they give you a lot of food.  For 13.95 for the seafood combiantion it is a steal.  They ask you how spicy you want you want your food (1-5).  I went with three and I am glad I did.  I think 4 or 5 would have been to much, but like goldilocks i am slut and 3 was just right.

What I like best about Thai Taste is their dining area decor. It's very exotic and traditional looking, as if you walked into Thailand. The bright red moldings on the ceiling and the elephant pattern tablecloths are a couple cool examples.  For dinner I had the Gaeng Dang, a seafood combination, red curry sauce in coconut cream with green peas, bamboo shoot, chili, string beans, basil leaves, scallops, shrimp and squid. It like Christmas in a curry plate!   The coconut milk blended in with the red curry seamlessly (and I am NOT a coconut fan) Paired along side with jasmine rice, the meal was absolute perfection!   The service was great and I my wait was for less than five minutes, which was a pleasant surprise. I will be back soon!",

Unfortunately, for us, we weren't super impressed with the service or food.   We ordered delivery on Sunday night. I was told it would be an hour wait, which was completely fine! 2 hours came by and I was literally about to call the place when the delivery guy knocked on the door. He apologized for being late (kinda laughing while saying it) and said they lost our ticket. I mean, I get it, people make misstakes in life. But geez, throw in a egg roll or something or atleast be sincere with an apology. Because of this, I have a feeling our food was just sitting under a warmer for a very long time.  I ordered the red curry chicken and my husband ordered the chicken pad thai. The red curry was actually very good. Big portion of chicken, veggies, rice, and red curry sauce. The pad thai was very much lacking. It was super sweet (even though we asked for like 4 star spicy) and tasted crazy bland and a bit stale (maybe like it had been sitting under a warmer for the past hour). Prices were a bit high for dinner. With tip and delivery fee, our total was about $30 or so.   If we decide to go back again, we definitely will be skipping the delivery and just picking up instead.",

I ordered the chicken Pad Thai I instantly asked how spicy can I get it? The woman said 5! I said let's do it! Her look on her face was that of surprise. She brought me a pitcher of water after I placed my order. Moments later I was delivered a tofu and rice soup. Which was delicious once I added some spicy pepper sauce. Before I new it my main dish was in front of me! The cabbage roll was so light and fluffy as if the angles had prepared it themselves! As I took a bite of the Pad Thai I was pleased! This was some of the best Thai that I have had in the States! As the flavors waltz on my tastebuds a little sweat started to roll off my forehead I wasn't sure if it was the heat index from the Charlotte atmosphere or if it was my dish?! Either way I have found my new Thai place for sure! This is a must try if you are ever in Charlotte!",

My last visit, we were actually seated near the desk where people come in and pay and the orders were lined up on the counter.... It would be a little overwhelming, but I think it's great that can handle that many orders at one time (this was also on a Sunday evening!!).  One minus is that they didn't have a kid's menu, but the server was good about recommending things that are good for children.  Had the C-2... curry at a spice level 4... and man it about kicked my a**.  Luckily they put all the pepper flakes in the middle so you can mix it in yourself (which I thought was smart) so you can gradually make it to your spice level... I went a little gun-ho and mixed it all in, but in hindsight should have taken it down a notch.   Oh well - another time.  Parking is a little tight, but there are plenty of spaces.  I would stay clear of the spaces toward the front of the lot because you have people zooming in and out trying to get their take out.  When you are hungry, you are hungry, because people seem to whip in here like no tomorrow...",

Service is great and if you are lucky to have Koon as your server she is kind, welcoming, and attentive.   I have tried many dishes and some are better than others. So I'd like to share my favs. I recommend trying Pad See Ew, don't be afraid to add additional veggies. Oh the classic shrimp Pad Thai. I recommend a little light on the sauce for these two dishes, gives a nice texture to the noodle dish.  Pad woon sen I love this one too, I find it a very light dish that does not lack on flavor (reminds me of a fancy chicken noodle soup without the soup :) and I always request my fav veggies. Fried rice is also very light and fluffy, and can be added to any dish on the side as a compliment. My husband really enjoys Gra Tiem Prig Thai (garlic stir fried dish) and adds broccoli.  Massaman Curry is fantastic and once again add a couple of your fav. veggies to compliment the delicious potatoes to help soak up this wonderful sauce. The Green curry dish is very good as well. My fav soups are the Tom yum and Tom kha. Obviously I Love my veggies and this is my preference when having Thai food. Request any veggies you want with these dishes, Thai taste is most accommodating to your special requests.  What makes this Thai restaurant 5 stars and keeps me coming back is the warm and kind atmosphere, always fresh lightly cooked veggies, and can be one of the best options for a healthier dish when you are looking to dine out. I hope that your experience is as wonderful as mine.   - Lily",

The \"hot pot\" (flame) is mostly for show, the soup never was really hot enough before it burned out so the mushrooms pretty much remained raw. Flavor was meh. Pretty good lemongrass flavor but no \"spice\" that Thai food should have.  We got a vegetable stir fry w shrimp. Very good flavors in a light sauce, but again, not an iota of spice. I have traveled to Thailand a couple of times and the only thing I can figure is the owners have watered down the dishes to suit American Tastes. As much as this place was recommended and I wanted to love it, was disappointed.",

    "text": "I like Thai Taste but I don't know that they are the \"best\" Thai restaurant I have ever been to.  I have visited the Matthews location as well and I was not very impressed.  The pad thai tasted fishy and the spice they used completely overpowered the other flavors.  So it was basically fishy cayanne.  Great!  Ok, I know this isn't about the Mattthews location but I had to preface this review by letting you know the experience I had at their sister location.  So, I tried the pud see ew.  I think the \"ew\" pretty much describes the dish.  Others recommended it so I went for it.  Big Mistake.  It was basically salted noodles with a couple pieces of broccoli.  I added shrimp and they were super fishy.  It just wasn't good.    My friend tried the green curry and that was pretty good...heavy on the coconut but it was decent.  My other friend tried something that had tofu in it so I didn't even try hers.  :)  The wine was served in these little dessert wine glasses that I couldn't even get my lips around--odd and not enjoyable.  The service was good, the atmosphere was simple, the prices were decent but I just am not that thrilled with the quality of the food.  I know for some reason it is just me but I just find it to be ok.",

People I know swear by it--I have friends that go at least twice a week--and it's very close to my house, so I've eaten there a few times.  Both times I have been very pleased with my dinner, but not totally blown out of the water.  Please don't ask me to remember the names of what I ordered, I usually just point, but it's always been good.    As a vegetarian, I like that almost everything can be made with just veggies (and tofu, if you want) and that everything is made fresh, so if you don't like a certain thing (say, carrots aren't for you) it's no problem at all to leave something out.  On my last trip I was avoiding carbs (which is hard as a vegetarian) but I was able to get a sauteed bowl with tofu, broccoli, spinach, and snow peas in a yummy sauce.  They totally skipped all the carby vegetables and rice for me.  It was a win!   Also, the servers are friendly and efficient.  And the prices are decent, especially for this area. For me, good food, customizable menu, and a decent price, all close to my house is a receipt for a good restaurant choice! I'll be back!",

I promised myself to try something new every time I come yet manage to order THE SAME THING EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Robin and I ordered the Koon Gra Bok as an appetizers which is marinated shrimp wrapped in egg roll shells, deep fried served with their sweet and sour sauce. Omg. I'm in love. I mean comon now, it's deep fried. It has a nice crunch to it. Remind me of the fried spring rolls my mom make at home. Delicious!!! For dinner or lunch I alway go with C-2, the chicken Mussamun curry with coconut milk, onions, potatoes and peanuts. Alway alway NON spicy because I can't take anything spicy. I like it, very favorable, nice curry kick without the hurting your nose or eyes while eating it. It finish with a nice crunchy peanuts topping. I have tried the Pud Thai which is very famous there. Is ok, a little to sweet for me. I also liked their pineapple fried rice but wish they can add Chinese sausages. I would like this dish even more.  Staffs there are alway nice. They remember people and what their ordered which is crazy to me. I like coming in and see the familiar faces. They get our food to the table quick, good customer services and always on point. I will and have been back...",

Thank GOD there is another one down in Matthews now (closer to home), but this one is a lunch-time sit down or dinner-time take-out standard.   If you are coming for lunch, be prepared to either (A) come a tad early to beat the rush or (B) wait a moment... the staff moves their behinds to get everyone seated and fed in  timely manner, but there is only so much they can do!  I love that hot soup is served as soon as you sit during lunch (not sure about dinner, but I'd assume so)... I love that all tea is served without sugar, but there are either simple syrup or sweetener options on the table... I love that the food is fresh, delicious, and perfectly spiced to my taste EACH and EVERY time! My favorite meal here is their Pra Rarm Long Song with shrimp and a bowl of Gaeng Jerd with tofu... I get this to go for dinner whenever my husband and I do a take-out night.... it's enough for two meals, and it's simply irresistible to me!  My second favorite is Pud Thai with shrimp... I love it super spicy!! As long as this restaurant stays in business, I will be a loyal customer! DELISH and PERFECT every time!  Service with a BIG beautiful smile!",

The portions are decent i wouldn't say they are large, but they are filling.  I also really like the Gaeng Dang a delicious curry dish made with coconut milk, and your choice of meat, chicken is always good, but shrimp is really great.  The creamy coconut milk juxtaposed with the hot curry is poetry in my mouth, deliciousness.  The ambiance is comfortable and small with lots of Thai wood carvings all over the walls and ornate complex origami and colorful mobiles hanging from the ceiling.  Thai Taste is a little pricey and not as much food as you get at other Thai restaurants in Charlotte, but still a great all around restaurant.",

We used to get Deejai Thai but they lost our business due to their cutting corners between take out and dine in.  The Tom Kha at Thai taste is much better than Deejai but the massaman at Deejai is slightly better than Thai Taste.  Why I dropped a star from Thai Taste is that when you ask for something spicy, instead of putting more fresh chilis in during the cook, they put some chili sauce in your bag for you to add.  This is effective but shifts the taste to something less authentic.",

After eating at a few mediocre places and one that was downright gross (ahem...Monsoon, I'm talking to you), at last I have found Thai food that is up to par.  First of all, the atmosphere of this place is great.  It's quiet and quaint, perfect for date night or a chill night out with friends.  The location is fantastic too, positioned right in Dilworth with Uptown just a skip away.  I'm a Pad Thai fanatic, so I always stick to the standard, and this did not disappoint.  The sauce was just nutty enough without tasting like peanut butter and the spice level was right on for my taste.  I always have tofu in my PT and theirs was super tasty, not soggy or squishy, but texturely pleasing.  I had the best soup too, but I can't remember the name of it for the life of me.  It was a spicy, salty broth full of chunks of squid, shrimp, and a whole yummy juicy scallop floating in the middle.  Awesome.  My bf and I each had full portion meals, soups, spring rolls, and hot jasmine tea for 35 bucks + tip.  Very reasonable, great service, great atmosphere...I will be back many times I'm sure!",

    "text": "Thai food...I have eaten a lot of it in many different places...including Thailand.  Therefore, as I have said before in my past reviews it is hard for me to be blown away.  As I found with this first visit, Thai Taste will meet your Thai food meal requirements if you live near or are in the area.    Atmosphere - Quasi-Thai decor, elephants, table seating, surprising for a Charlotte Thai restaurant...no mint green paint!   Food - I ordered the Beef Salad Grilled to start.  It consisted of sliced beef mixed w/ cucumbers, red onions, chili, and tomatoes all marinated in a Thai spicy dressing.  It was respectable, as the steak was of decent quality.  The dressing used in the salad however lacks the little zing that I am accustomed too.  For my main dish, I had the Gaeng Keow Wan Curry, which was a green curry in coconut gravy with lemon grass, bamboo shoots, peas, carrots, bell peppers, chili, and basil leaves.  I inquired and was surprised to find out that they will adjust the dish ingredients.  This is great if the server understands what you did or did not want.  I asked that they omit the peas and for some reason she had them hold the carrots and add green beans.  Oh well...I never could figure why the US Thai restaurants always want to put green beans and/ or peas in their curry dishes.  Anyway, the dish was still satisfying but not spicy enough for my liking.      Service - polite, accommodating, confused, quick   Price - The pricing was on average to high for the quantity of food received.    Overall - While I will not go out of my way to eat here again, but if I am in the area or with a group of friends, like this night, and craving Thai...Thai Taste will fit the bill.",

    "text": "a lot of people seem to like this place, and i don't know really know why. i mean, the food just tastes okay. i think it's kind of pricey, too, for what you get. here is why i think so:  1) i've been to thailand, and the food here tastes like watered-down thai food. like more westernized than it should be.  2) i got a green curry, and all the vegetables that were in it were obviously frozen and the dish seemed like it was reheated--rather than being made-to-order. it was super-slow in the restaurant too, and i did not hear nor see any real cooking going on from my viewpoint of the kitchen. plus, we got our food unnaturally fast. 3) they serve canned sodas, instead of fountain. even though i don't drink soda that much, there are days when you just want something bubbly and caffeinated. plus, you don't want to have to pay over $1.50 or so for each glass you consume. 4) i am greatly influenced by the clientele. being a restaurant that serves asian cuisine, i like to not be the only asian person eating there. sorry folks. i'm not racist. it just makes sense that if other asians like it, then it's gonna be good.",

What I got was steamed veggies and shrimp, the sauce was bland with no attempt to incorporate it into the dish. They basically ladled the sauce on the bottom of the plate, then put the steamed food on top like an after thought. Oddly disappointing, and something that should be simple to do.   I took one bite, waited for my dining partner to finish with his (which was just OK) we asked for mine to be taken off our bill, the server was ungracious and didn't ask what they could have done to make it better. If their response was different, I would not be writing this review. At this point in the economy, we can not stand spending money on businesses that disappoint. Needless to say, this place is out of our rotation. As we were leaving, they had a sign on the door saying they had to raise their prices. Sadly, it seems like they've had to lower their quality in the process.",

I tried Thai Taste after reading a bunch of reviews that it was one of, if not the best in Charlotte. I enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant and can't say anything negative about the wait staff. Its a nice location in Dilworth. I of course ordered pad thai. I was a little unfairly disappointed, but I usually am with pad thai. I am always in search of a dish that tastes as amazing as the one in Gainesville. But that's not fair to try and compare....sooo, I give this restaurant 4 stars. While not the pad thai I crave love and desire....this was still very tasty and I enjoyed my leftovers just as much the next day. I will definitely return. P.S. My husband loved his food too. P.P.S. I think I need to just end my search for the Gville pad thai flavor and I should be okay. Maybe.",

Either way, there I was, at my rotation site without any rations on me. Luckily, at 10:00 AM, my preceptor receives a phone call stating that a drug rep was bringing us lunch. He ordered Thai food and ordered the entire office chicken pad thai.  At approximately 12:30 PM, the drug rep came with take-out boxes of chicken pad thai with extra rolls. The portions were definitely large, served with one spring roll and about two servings of noodles. The smell was enough to get my mouth watering, and I couldn't wait any longer. I heaped a generous portion of chicken pad thai into my mouth...and well...let's say that I have had better. There were sour notes in the noodles themselves, and the chicken was poorly seasoned. The noodles were clumped together suggesting that it wasn't fresh. Yes, yes, I know...this was take-out, but part of eating is savoring the presentation as well. The spring roll itself  was too heavy on the wrapper and devoid of filling; it was as if I was just eating the wrapper itself. What the heck was the filling?",

We ordered a vegetarian Pad Thai, the Mussamun Curry, steamed rice, and the Tom Kha. The Pad Thai was simply disgusting, the portion is large but it tasted like watered-down bad fish sauce. It's also a very strange red color, must different from any Pad Thai I've had elsewhere. The curry was decent but quite bland and definitely had no spice, fortunately the rice was well cooked. The Tom Kha was also bland yet bad tasting and had large chunks of tomato, which I found very odd. Overall, this was a really disappointing meal.",

Happily obliged an early lunch and we certainly beat the impending crowd that tends to form right around lunchtime proper.   The lunch menu is very quaint. About 7 options that can all be tailored for choice of protein, veggies, level of spice and other accoutrement. Variations of pad thai, soups. rice dishes and mixed veggies. I settled on the pad thai and was thrilled with the result. Baby bok choy, bean sprouts, rice noodles, a spring roll and a delectable dipping sauce. It's a hefty portion for such a cheap lunch, too. I went with 2-star spice and was happy I did. It cleared my sinus cavity with ease.   My #1 recommendation: order the hot tea. Especially on a cold day. It's a simple oolong/citrus tea that works so well with the food. I'm stoked to come back and order the tea again.   The service is super friendly, fast, and fun. They were attentive throughout our meal.   Though the menu isn't vast for lunch, I'd like to come back in for dinner sometime soon.   Cheer, Thai Taste!",

The place is tastefully decorated although the tables are a bit close together so if there were a chance I was going to have an intimate conversation with myself, someone would probably here it.   As far as the food, I ordered a clear soup that was loaded with veggies.  It was so fresh and satisfying.   The main course is something I usually try at other area Thai restaurants.  I forget the name it just has vegetables and basil and my choice of meat which was chicken.  No rice for me and they didn't have a problem with that.  The plate came out full and nicely displayed with shredded red cabbage on the side.    I usually order 4-5 stars of spice level at Thai places, depending on what their highest level is.  For Thai Taste, it's a 5.  So that's what I ordered and it did not disappoint.  Most places come out a 3 and I'm adding more spice on the table.  This was spot on and enough to linger just when I went out the door.    So now I re-found my neighborhood Thai place.  This place has it all.  Good food, good service and good prices.",

Food came out in  less than 10 minutes.  I thought that was unusually fast. Got home and ate and the food sucked! It did not taste fresh at all. The noodles seemed old or had been sitting a long time. There was also an overly powerful vinegar taste. I couldn't find the egg in my pad Thai plus there was a weird grainy texture as well that didn't taste like ground peanuts. Considering this was my first time at Thai Taste dilworth, I was definitely not pleased!",

For my entree, I ordered pad thai, which I prepare at home and love.  As with my visit before, I requested a heat level of 4.  The dish arrived, with tofu, vegetables, and a heavily sweetened sauce, but no heat.  Like before, I dumped the supposedly hot sauce from the table on it with no noticeable results.  Next time, should I request a heat level of 10?  It only goes up to 5.  My husband requested a heat level of 3, and he stated that his dish was spicier than mine.  Is it that my tolerance for spiciness exceeds most people's expectations?  Or, does the restaurant think that as a woman, my longing for heat is wantonly and should be more subdued?  The food is not bad (although I would appreciate the sauce being less sweet and hotter); therefore, I can't lower the rating, but I certainly won't give a higher one.",

The flavors are pretty good, it's not the most authentic Thai restaurant, but for the price you are paying to get a lunch combo, it's great. Also, this place is pretty good for group setting. I do have to say it is is not the most spacious restaurant so be sure to come early or don't come right at prime time lunch hour.

If you like Thai food, they have all the great options. You really can't go wrong with any of them. Just let your server know what you like or don't like and they'll be able to point you in the right direction.   Also, let them know if you want your entree spicy with some heat. I think they do none - 4 or 5. But if you really like things hot let them know you like it 'Thai' hot and not 'American' hot, LOL... there is a difference.   They also have really good Thai tea, it's extra and not included in the free drink price, but completely worth it to try. It's similar in taste to chai tea but a little different, comes to you cold (it's not a hot tea, kind of the consistency of bubble tea without any boba).

The taste is very bland.  The curry w beef is...  just ok.  The meat is very minimal in a meal, about 6 thin sliced beef.  Chewy but not very fresh taste.  My wife couldn't finish her pad thai, too sour and the whole thing just doesn't feel right.  May consider this restaurant again if I m very hungry and in the area, but otherwise I will be put looking for a better thai restaurant.",

I'd walk in and he'd immediately put the bag in front of me. Pad Thai with chicken. Spicy level 3. Spring rolls. I find it so hard to branch out from this wonderful combination. The Pad See Ew is also delightful...full of broccoli and thick noodles. I get it with beef. I wish I had time to take an actual lunch break from work so I could go there for their lunch specials, but take-out for dinner will have to do. Beware about the spice...it's not always consistent. I tend to get the 3, and the last time I got it my meal was barely spicy. Other times the level 3 has made my date cry.   When I eat inside, I typically have a great experience...minus the one time like 8 years ago when a roach dropped onto my table. But nothing since then! The wait staff has always been friendly and everything seems clean. The food comes out quickly and hot and fresh. I will continue going back to That Taste!",

We took bites of our entrees after being disappointed by our appetizers, paid the check, and went to another restaurant to have dinner.   To start, the pad Thai recipe appears to be boxed noodles, ketchup and a few stingy pieces of chicken. Nothing but red noodles on a plate. It's like what I'd call Thai to my 3 year old if i was making it at home and was for some reason forced to make him eat Thai food.   Pad see ew was equally bland and devoid of the veggies that are part of the dish. Boiled noodles with some chicken tossed on top and a shake of soy sauce. I mean.... I could do better in a dorm room with a hot plate.   The apps tasted like they came from a box frozen and heated in the microwave. Trader Joe's has better offerings.   There is definitely a void of good Asian and Thai offerings in Charlotte, but how this place stays in business is a mystery to me.",

Then they got theirs we sat 10 minutes after them, one table got their food before us, but yet the other table did not they didn't get theirs until we were half done with ours, kinda weird. Food was phenomenal, can't complain at all, we got spring rolls as an app, the a pineapple curry dish and chicken fried rice, both delicious.

Despite the mad rush, we waited only a few minutes to get a table.  I love any place that will immediately bring me a bowl of soup after I am seated. It's like a hug. So comforting and soothing.  The lunch specials are a little limited, but all the basics are there. I went with my usual: Shrimp Pad Thai. It comes with a spring roll and yummy dipping sauce. For me, the portion size is big enough to split into two meals. I always have leftovers to take home... no matter how hungry I am.  I got a water and a Coke, but was super jealous when they brought my friend's iced tea. It came with a pitcher of iced tea as well. I guess it's best soda doesn't come in a pitcher... although, that's probably every dentist's dream. Paging Dr. Cavity.  Dine in or take out... Thai Taste is a great place to grab food. Service is always on point... even when it's crazy busy. The people here are super nice. Never had a bad experience here. And to be honest, I don't know anyone who has.

I was walking past the back door of the restaurant to my car and the door swung open and I got a glimpse into the kitchen - it was disgusting! Slimy floors, food all over the place and sweating cooks hovered over the stoves.  3. My friend found a maggot in his food. Yes that's right a MAGGOT.   Need I say more?   While Thai Taste's biggest competitor (Monsoon) is less tasty than them, I would rather eat their food because their health ratings have always been a consistent A+.",

We'll visit T^2 again - probably weekly until the waitress doesn't bat an eye when I order my curry at a 5.  I'm wishing we'd ordered double just so I'd have something for a late night snack.

The service was not overly friendly, but oh well. The Tom Kha soup was excellent.  The pad Thai, not so much.  It was weirdly saucy and blah, instead of fresh and flavorful.  Also, prices were not cheap.",

It can be packed, but with the cheap, fast lunch specials, they get you in and out quickly. You sit down at the table and soup magically arrives in front of you before you've even ordered.   Some call it boring, but I really love Thai fried rice and I tend to get that along with an order of chicken satay. Both are pretty good and filling. I've always got leftovers to take home and enjoy for another meal.",

The veggies and chicken in the soup were good, but the only flavor that really stood out was the sweetness of the coconut milk.  Same with the fried rice, it lacked flavor.

Their seafood red curry is absolutely creamy and well-seasoned that you can help but drink every last drop of the sauce! My partner always goes for the Tofu red curry, which is her all time favorite.

Sure it has mirrored embroidered elephant prints and little bamboo shoots, but so does Pier 1. The food is why we go  out to eat and the experience weighs pretty heavy too. This place hits about half way on both fronts:  Food is mediocre. If you've ever been at a real Thai restaurant, you'd know it. The Tom Ka Soup was lacking all the usual fair: galanga, lemon grass, ginger....where were you? I missed you in there. Instead, I got a watery coconut broth with tofu and raw mushrooms. No baby corn, but broccoli instead; which in my opinion is very weird in soup, especially if it's cut for a salad. The Pad Thai was pretty good. No mystery meat, real cuts of beef (god bless the south), but it was a bit on the sweet side (god bless the south).   Service was diner quality, pretty much non-existant. I don't know if I'd recommend it, but it's probably worth take out.",

East Blvd. is in the heart of Dilworth and near the gym, so it's only natural that I can pick up take-out orders or meet a friend at Thai Taste.  - Quality of food.  I'm a pretty boring Thai eater.  I stick with Pad Thai or Red Curry for the most part, but even so  you can definitely tell a difference in quality from one place to the next.  The Pad Thai made spicy is pretty stellar.  I only have two complaints about Thai Taste, one is pretty relevant and one is because I'm ridiculous.  Relevant - Menu selection.  Didn't seem like a large choice in dishes and I know a lot of the other Thai places I've been to had more of a selection.  I found a dish at a restaurant in University I wanted to try at Thai Taste and it was nowhere to be found.  Ridiculous - I drink a lot of diet coke, and Thai Taste serves them in cans which means that I can't drink nearly as much diet coke as I'm used to.",

The waitress was very friendly and took our order quickly, but without rushing us.   My husband got the Panang with pork, level 3, and it was fantastic (I feel like I ate most of it after I finished my more healthful choice, which was delicious as well).  The sauce was spicy, but not overwhelming, and the meat was very tender.  I had the stir-fried asparagus with chicken, and it was very tasty, despite being a 'healthier' option. I did add some mystery sauce that was on the table, just to try it out, and it was good as well.    We also both got brown rice, which was perfectly cooked, and not too crunchy, as poorly-cooked brown rice can be.   The prices hover around $13 a person, without appetizers, and I had 3 more meals later that week from our leftovers.  A very reasonably priced menu.  Overall, this was a great dining experience, and we will go back many, many, many, many times!!!",

    "text": "Went there tonight with 2 other adults and a toddler. Food was good, not spectacular. Service was slow and it took a long time for us to be able to place our order, which meant cranky toddler and increasingly cranky adults.  Almost all the tables had a young child at it, so patrons feel comfortable bringing their children there.  One dish, Gaeng curry, was noticeably hotter than the others. However we weren't asked our spiciness preference so I am not sure why the difference.  If you are curious what the \"pea-carrot\" ingredient is that shows up in many of the dish descriptions, it is frozen veggies from a bag.  Overall, an enjoyable dinner though we will probably keep looking for another place to get our Thai fix.",

All the lunch specials (almost all under $10) come with soup, spring roll, rice, iced tea, and the entree. Bargain right there. Personal selection was Pud Thai with spicy level 3 out of 5.  Delicious all around. The portions are dinner size too!  I will return for sure, Thai after time.",

There are 7 options daily, from traditional Pad Thai and Pud See Ew to others like Pud Asparagus and Rice with Veggies.  With each dish you add your protein, shrimp, chicken, pork and beef. So far my favorite is the Pud Asparagus. If you like asparagus, and knowing they are fresh this time of year, this is your dish! Once your order is placed your complimentary soup is served, a clear broth with napa cabbage, peas and carrots, so perfect to start a meal.  Overall the dishes are great and the service is on point, they have a system that works great!",

It makes no effort to be trendy, romantic, fancy, new, or even that accommodating, but the people who run it are great and everything on the menu is amazing. Best Pad Thai in town, but other dishes (gang dang?) are great too. Good for takeout as well as eat in. Too many places are new and slick but mediocre in Charlotte. This place is, in sharp contrast, one of a kind. A truly unique restaurant that makes no effort to be anything other than a reflection of the people who run it and the fantastic food they serve. It gets packed at lunchtime on weekdays, so come early or late. I love this place. It's one of the few restaurants in Charlotte that I would hate to see go. One of the first places I adopted as a go to restaurant when I moved here 20 years ago, and the same/just as great today as it was then. I bet I've eaten here 100 times and it has never disappointed.",

They have a half dozen lunch specials that are inexpensive, served fast and served tasty. Red or green curry, pad thai and some other things that I never order because the pad thai is just excellent.  When you order, the heat is measured from \"0 stars\" (no heat at all) to \"5 stars\" (should be served with a fire extinguisher). Remember to ask for \"fresh peppers\" instead of the dried peppers which doesn't change the level of heat but does change the flavor a bit. Depending on mood, I'm having either two stars or three stars and that's plenty hot for me.  One of these days, I'll land here outside of lunch hours. It hasn't happened yet.

I've seen this restaurant a million times while visiting paper skyscraper so I decided to give it a try. It was crazy packed so I was thankful I was ordering to-go. I ordered vegetable pud thai, which based on the description I figured was a twin sibling to pad thai.   (sigh) This was nowhere near as delicious as the pad thai that I order at other places. While the spring roll was pretty good, I didn't even eat half of the pud thai. It was dry and lacked flavor. I ordered a level four spice but it wasn't spicy throughout- there were just a ton of crushed peppers on top. Also, there was no slice of lime, which normally adds to the flavor.

The soup, I feel, was a take on chicken noodle soup but with tofu instead of chicken. We ordered the lunch kee mao and spicy chicken dish. I feel like they sacrificed quality for speed here. The Kee Mao was very bland with questionable chicken pieces, way too chewy for my liking. The chili chicken was also very bland.  What I really disliked about our experience here was the fact that they don't take spice levels seriously. When a restaurant asks how spicy you like it, they make it to order so the customer does not have to change the spice levels themselves. Thai Tastes chefs dumped a clump of red chili pepper flakes on top of both dishes to achieve a spice level of 3.5/5, that is a lot of chili flakes. This lazy move made our dishes inedible! We left quickly without taking the large amount of food that remained.   We definitely won't be back. I prefer Thai Thai Takeout, the quality is a lot better and you get more bang for your buck.",

Plenty of food in a serving, yummy Pad Thai (spelled Pud Thai here) and yellow curry (you know, the more mild one with a heavy coconut influence), modestly priced, maybe 10-15 for dinner.  Lunch specials seem to be quite a steal, for under 10 bucks you get a hefty entree with spring roll, soup and that nectar of the gods, Thai iced tea. The place has busy Thai art on the walls, plastic on the tables, and a fairly authentic feel overall so come on and enjoy yourself.  Also their website is cute.  Check out the staff photos.",

What I can speak to is how the food tasted: great.   My girlfriend got the curry (they offer three, and she chose the red curry over the yello and green curries), which came with rice, and it was really good. It did not, however, hold a candle to my selection, which was basic thai noodles with crispy duck. Maybe it's just because I LOVE duck, but this is one of the better dishes I've had in Charlotte in a long time. If you go there, order it. It was great--and only around $16, which is pretty good for any duck dish. Both dishes came with rice, and it was a lot of food: we had leftovers for at least two lunches.   I will definitely go back to Thai Taste.",

    "text": "Simply put, this is the best Thai in Charlotte.  Nothing too fancy, just a lot of the basics done consistently and without unnecessary frills.  This is like that little unassuming hole in the wall that you almost have to know about before you're willing to walk in and try it.  But once you do sit down, you know you've found a gem you'll come back to again.  Thai Taste has been around since my high school days, always in the same building, and I don't think the decor has changed one bit.  Neither has the menu, but then you don't go messing with a good thing.  Let me just say lunch is a much better value here than dinner- if for no other reason that you get a small bowl of a simple soup and a crispy spring roll served with a side of orange sauce, regardless of your entree choice.  Yes, it can be crowded at the height of lunch, but I've never had to wait long, even when people stand around outside the (only) door.  If you wait till 1 PM or beyond, you'll just about have the place to yourself.  The crowd is generally a mix of suits and the more casually dressed, with a few cops and the scrub-wearing hospital workers thrown in for good mix.    The lunch menu is a much-abbreviated version of the dinner menu.  A single laminated page of about 8-10 dishes that each have a good, plain english description of what it is you are browsing.  Want a classic not on the menu?  Just ask- the menu does rotate by the day of the week so they will make just about anything for you if it is a traditional Thai dish.    You get your choice of meat with each entree, which determines the price, or you can always choose to go vegetarian, which usually means tofu, though you can decline the same, as you can also decline eggs in the dish as well.  Here's my best tip- if you like Pad Thai (Pud Thai here, per the menu) get the vegetarian option if you like extra colorful veggies.  Lots more broccoli and carrots than if you order a meat.  Tofu is sauteed on the outside, but absorbs the wonderful peanut sauce that is the base of the dish.  Portions are always generous, so come hungry.  Un-sweet iced tea is included with every meal too, they'll usually bring a small pitcher for your table.  Here's my second tip- drink the tea, you'll need it if you like any advanced level of spice.  Coke and other soda is available, but it is served by the can and costs extra.  You already effectively paid for the tea in the price of the lunch, so drink it.  If I had one complaint, it is this- they ask you how spicy you like your dish and indicate the same using 1-5 \"stars.\"  In my experience, the only difference between 1 and 5 stars is the amount of red pepper flakes dumped on top of the finished product.  1 is to little, 5 is just too much.  With the number of Thai peppers and sauces available, I'd like to think we could do better here, but it's just not to be had here.  Note this restaurant now has other locations in both Matthews and University City.  Don't be fooled, the original still stands above the rest.",

The spice was balanced perfectly, and I gobbled it all up, including all of the rice.  This was delicious!  My partner had pad Thai, which was tasty but too sweet for my liking.  We had lettuce wraps and spring rolls for appetizers. Both were pretty good, but not outstanding.  The lettuce wrap filling could have included some shredded pork or egg, but appeared to just be crispy fried noodles.  Maybe I didn't read the menu carefully enough before ordering, but the flavor was still pretty good.    The Thai iced coffees were very good, though I've had better for sure.  The atmosphere is kitschy, but I prefer this kind of older, established place over most new and fancy places like you'll find all over uptown and south end.  There's no pretense here, which is refreshing for the charlotte restaurant scene.  Prices seemed fair for what you get.  Based just on the panang curry I'll be back for sure ;)",

Only once did I not enjoy something I had because it was just too salty. I believe it was the Pud See Ew. But every other time I've ordered chicken with vegetables in a light, delicate sauce (don't remember name of it), it's been great!! We came for dinner once but found that its was too expensive, especially considering you didn't get the extras you get with lunch. The lunch menu is a much better value. I wish they had another soup selection though. I'd love to get something with noodles in the broth instead of that tofu-looking stuff. Overall, we really enjoy this place.

I have no problem with that if for no other reason than it makes it easier for everyone else (myself included, naturally) to park, and they do not have a large lot, so every little bit helps.  That small lot probably makes sense, because it's not a large restaurant - and that only adds to the attraction. They know what they offer and are fine with it. Sometimes you get places that decide they want to offer a cavernous dining area, and that is fine - but here, the dining experience is exactly what fits.  As to the staff, they are not overly friendly, but they are definitely courteous, and they will help you decide on your meal, and you will get your meal promptly. It's not exactly fast, like you will find at some other places (generally Asian), who likely have things simmering in a variety of vats in the kitchen, but it is certainly not slow.  Spices can be adjusted as you like, though if you really like it hot, you'll need to make sure to tell them - even going to a 4 or 5 may not be enough if you like it really hot (I personally am fine with a 3.5 or so).  After all these years, this Thai Taste remains one of my favorite places to grab a satisfying bite. You're free to keep passing by, so as to keep that lot open when I need it.",

I've only been to a handful of Thai restaurants, but this one definitely stands out as the best I've been to so far.   We went for lunch and were seated immediately. All lunch entrees come with a pitcher of iced tea, rice, and a spring roll. I got the Pud Khing Sod which was their ginger based dish. It was absolutely delicious. The ginger flavor really came through without being overpowering. The vegetables were all very fresh and well cooked. The only complaint I heard at the table was that it wasn't very spicy (I don't like spicy food, so this wasn't a problem for me). Everyone cleared their plates, so it must have been good!  I'll definitely be coming back here in the future for lunch and recommending it to others as well!",

Instead of trying Thai Basil we stopped here. The place is cute and simple. Our food came out fast.  I got green curry.  It looked like old school Dinty Moore soup or like chicken and dumplings. The taste wasn't bad.  Green curry to me is like pizza. Pizza is pretty hard not to like (even if it's cold etc). The green curry was just ok.  Looked like frozen peas and carrots mixture fancied up with basil. My man got drunken noodle and asked for no peas. His was a little better than ok.  I love eggplant, zucchini's, squashes, peppers etc used in Thai food. I guess I felt the ingredients could have been more hearty? More authentic? I don't know what word I'm looking for. End of story we were hungry, it came quick and it was ok but not great",

    "text": "Thai Taste is one of my top 5 favorites in Charlotte, hands down. The food is always delicious, service is good, and the price is right (especially because I typically get two meals from one order).   Parking can be a little hard to come by depending on the time of day, especially because the lot is shared by Paper Skyscraper customers. When it is busy, I tend to turn right on Euclid and pull in the back of the complex for a better shot at snagging an open spot.   The ambiance of Thai Taste is dated, for lack of a better term, but honestly, you're not coming here for ambiance. You're coming here for an delicious meal. #37 is my go-to: Pra Rarm Long Song (Spinach). The homemade peanut sauce is heavenly. We've also tried quite a few of the curries and haven't gone wrong there, either.   Can't wait to go back - writing this review already has me planning my next visit. :)",

    "text": "This is another one of those, \"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!\"  As one of my all time favs, I thought for certain I had given this place 5 stars long ago!  Located on East Blvd in Dilworth, this place is tucked in a corner pocket and can be easy to miss.  It shares a tiny parking lot with Paper Skyscraper.  Once inside, it's a small space with traditional Thai decor.  They have made the most out of the small space with many tables relatively close to one another, and it can be a bit loud when at max capacity.    They offer all of the Thai standards including Pad Thai, Red and Green Curry, and Pad Se Ew.  Most entrees come with your choice of chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp.  Servers use the 0 to 5 star scale when asking for your spice level preference.  Lunch is served with the soup of the day as a first course as well.    Wait at the door to be seated upon entry.  Not to worry if others are ahead of you, as the tables tend to turn quickly.  Head straight to the bar for carryout or call ahead orders.  If dining in, you'll need to take the check to the counter to pay after your server leaves it on your table.   Hours of operation are a bit tricky.  They are closed on Sundays and Mondays.  Tuesday through Friday they close after lunch at 2pm and reopen for dinner at 5pm.  They remain open between lunch and dinner on Saturdays.",

All lunch specials come with a spring roll, ice tea and a bowl of cabbage broth soup! With the chicken added, it was $8.95, but you can also opt for a combination platter (chicken + beef) or seafood for a slight up charge. They also had pud thai that looked delicious, but I'm a sucker for the curry and coconut milk...  The soup was light and delicious. Tasted very similar to chicken noodle soup and had bits of tofu in it. The spring roll was a great little touch and the dipping sauce was a nice compliment. But, the Gaeng Panang was bomb! It had the right amount of sweetness and spice to it- even though I added some extra red pepper oil to it. It definitely hit the spot - I think it beat Basil Thai's green curry, which I also love.  All in all, my husband and I had lunch for under $20 here and left satisfied. I wish they had lunch specials on the weekend as it can get a little pricy here during dinner ($15-18/dish). However, I would definitely return. The pud thai is next on my list!",

The staff was very friendly and seated as soon as I walked in.  I ordered a Thai tea which was really good, I don't think you can really mess that up. I also ordered Fresh Basil rolls as an appetizer and Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai. The Fresh Basil rolls were probably the biggest rolls I've ever had so 1 roll was probably all I needed but it came with 2. I don't remember if it had shrimp in the roll which usually comes in the roll when I've ordered at other places. The peanut sauce was good.   The Pad Thai was ok. I believe the rice noodles were too thin and mushy for my liking. The portion was huge and I could barely eat half of the plate.   I think this place is more of a lunch time stop.

    "text": "This is the only time I have ever felt deceived by a high star number on Yelp.  My husband and I were walking around Southend pub hopping, and when it was time for dinner we pulled out the 'ol Yelp app and found this place right around the corner and with a solid four star rating.  We LOVE thai food, and we know that it is always a good option for vegetarians in unknown restaurant areas.  Unfortunately we were completely underwhelmed.  The restaurant itself is really cute - lots of wood paneling, Thai themed decor and paintings, wood tables and chairs.  The staff was also very friendly.  That's about where anything resembling four starts ends for me.  I ordered the Pad Thai as I have found this to be steadily good in the twenty or so other Thai restaurants I have eaten at around the country.  Here, it tasted like it was mixed up with a weird sweet and sour sauce.  Pad Thai should not be sweet.  At all.  They also did not give us the option for hotness levels, which I didn't think of until after we ordered, so our food came out very mild.  My husband ordered the Pad Woon Sen, which while better than my Pad Thai, was still unimpressive.  I left disappointed with a sticky sweet taste in my mouth.  If this had come up on the app as a three star restaurant, our experience would have been much more explainable.  Hopefully the food is better other times, though what was coming out to other tables looked much like what we were served so I don't know.  I would give the ambiance, location and service a four, but the food a one or two.  I can't give this place a three star review, because I really don't feel that it's \"A-ok\".  So we'll go with the two star \"Meh, I've experienced better\", because that's exactly how I feel.",

    "text": "This is the best Thai food in Charlotte.  I repeat.  This is the BEST Thai food in Charlotte. Another one of the \"secret\" restaurants that you need to be told about it's located in the Dilworth area right next to the popular gift store Paper Skyscraper.  The original and best of several locations (Matthews, University) I went there religiously the entire time I lived in CLT.    As diverse as their menu was, I only sampled three dishes there Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao and \"House Noodles\".  The last one being a specialty that's no longer listed on the menu.  The rating system is 1 to 6 stars and you can even order it with no stars for the scared or gastro-intestinally challenged.  For the True \"chili head\" you can augment the rating system.  Normally, they use crushed Thai peppers in the food which are still hot but don't capture the True essence of the \"heat\" and flavor.  When you're ready for the big leagues make sure to denote \"fresh peppers\" when giving them your stars.  The flavor difference is immediately noticeable from the very first bite.  For lunch during the week you need to get there by 11:30am or after 1:00pm unless you want to stand in line for a long time.  The place is popular and regularly packed.  They get all the businesses in the area, the residents of the trendy Dilworth neighborhood and a boatload of cops.  For many (like myself) this place is an addiction and you will see many regulars.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  When I spent most of '07 overseas this was one of the first places I hit upon returning to the States.  Even now, all other Thai places I encounter are measured against Thai Taste.  If you spend any time in the Charlotte area you simply MUST try this restaurant out, you will not be disappointed.  *side note* For the truly adventurous you can go past the 6 star rating, but be prepared for \"heat\" especially when going the \"fresh peppers\" route.  Also be aware that anything over 10 stars is a personal challenge to the chef and he will guarantee you feel more heat/pain than you ever have in your life.  Enjoy responsibly.",

I had the pad thai, which was cool for $7, but I would've been mad had I laid down $12 for that little plate at dinner. The spice rating, 1-5 stars, only correlates to the size of the mound of dried chili flakes they dump on top of your dish. That's just lazy; something cooks do for people who don't know better. The thai iced tea is creamy and flavorful, but not as sweet as I'd like. I'm used to thai tea that's almost like a dessert. It was refreshing, but not heavenly. My girl got a sad little beef and mushroom dish that had barely any flavor to the starchy sauce. It's not the worst joint in the world, and if I lived or worked very nearby I would probably frequent it, but it's definitely not worth a cross-town drive.

When I got home I noticed that it had a grey look to it and an odd smell. The smell I can only compare to that of an elephant. I thought perhaps that this was more of a traditional Pad See Ewe or that maybe it had been cooked for too long. But, the cabbage was grey and the taste was nasty. I ate a few bites and threw it away. Why didn't I contact the restaurant about this? I don't know. I was a much nicer person back then, I suppose. But, obviously if I'm writing this 3 years later something was wrong.  And no, I never returned to \"overpriced just because it's in Dilworth\" Thai Taste. Thai House (University AND Pineville-Matthews road) is MUCH better and a bit cheaper.",

Nestled in a little corner off of East Blvd (attached to Paper Sky Scrapers) this is by far the best Thai place in Charlotte.

The place is lovely!  If you like Thai you will absolutely LOVE Thai Taste.  The Red Curry is a game changer.  I get it every time (and dream about it at night)!",

It was good enough, but good enough wasn't what I was hoping for. If you ask most americans if they like Thai food, those that don't will probably say they don't because they don't like spicy food. If you are one of those people, you will love Thai taste. In order to get food even remotely spicy, you need to ask to have it made spicy and though I didn't know this at the time, the people at the table next to us did and still seemed disappointed at the spice level for \"hot\".  If you're out on the south side and need a quick, fairly cheap meal, I would say Thai Taste is worth going to. If you are out seeking some good Thai food, I recommend going elsewhere. You will not find it here.  Other than that, the location is nice, the staff was nice and prompt, and the prices were good. Everything was good except for the americanized thai food.",

Thai Taste on East Blvd is what I imagine heaven to taste like. A bold statement I know.   I have eaten at many a thai place in Charlotte and will only give my two enthusiastic thumbs up review to Thai Taste. At one point I was hitting up Thai Taste so regularly I thought I was going to recreate a Thai Food version of Cheers. I had to back down after that.   As for the food I can recommend pretty much everything on the menu minus the stuff boasting some SERIOUS spice. My taste buds don't handle spicey well.   The Pad Thai is insanely amazing as is the Pad See Ew (those are my ultimate favorite). If you go during lunch be sure to get there a little early as the place gets PACKED. Packed I tell you. Once you're sitting down it's a pretty quick turn around and the food always comes out piping hot.   Light eaters beware, the portions are pretty generous. Not that I'm complaining.",

There are restaurants light years better in Boston and Chicago, but for now, TT will do.   The ambiance is kind of old school, tables with plastic covers the random wood-carving, and a hammock hanging from the ceiling with a fake person napping inside.  It's not my favorite, but hey, it adds to the charm.   Since this place has been reviewed so many times, I'll just give my 2-cent tip. Lunch specials are a great value.  For about $6 or $7 bucks, depending on the protein you pick, you'll get an entree (some with rice), a spring roll, soup and iced tea.  (Iced tea and soup not included if you get lunch special take out.)   I've gotten the squash special, which is stir-fried yellow squash and protein of choice...that was an insane $12.95 by comparison.  (The dish itself was OK, not as flavorful as the Pad See Ew and the squash for some reason had a squeaky sound whenever I bit into them.)   Overall, it's a nice neighborhood joint where the service is good, and you will have a good meal.  Maybe not stellar, out-of-this-world great (like Paula Deen would say) but you'll leave happy and very full.",

The restaurant was small and cozy, but I imagine if I had went at a busier time it might have just felt crowded.  The menu is laid out so you pick your entree and combo it with choice of meat. I went for the green curry with chicken. Usually when I have green curry it has a decent kick to it due to the paste being made from green chilies and balances out the sweetness of the coconut. This green curry while pretty aromatic seriously lacked some much needed heat. After reading some reviews on here though I'll probably try it again and request it extra hot.  The prices are pretty reasonable and the service is attentive enough to keep my water glass full which is much appreciated! My meal arrived in a very timely manner and I left full and happy. Probably one of the better Thai places I've been to in Charlotte, I'll have to come back and try out their Pad Thai along with a hopefully spicier green curry.",

Spicy but not overpowering and the basil really comes through.    Service is friendly, if slightly challenged when it gets crowded.  But as opposed to most western style settings, any server will help you get what you need, such as water, chopsticks, the bill, etc.  Highly recommended.    The chicken satay can be a little dry.  The chicken dumplings have changed recently.  They used to be gyoza style but lately are shumai.  And when the menu says fried, they mean deep fried, not pan fried.  The lettuce wraps have the meat and vegetable filling already mixed in with the mung bean (crunchy white) noodles so it loses its flavor.  That's the first thing they've gotten wrong.  But everything else has been just right.",

Mine was excellent and so was my husband's, but both needed more spice; enter the garlic sauce.  Ahh, that's better! Now I get that we are in Dilworth and not everyone can handle Thai spice, but these dishes were way too Americanized.  Adding the garlic sauce definitely added a world of difference.  The quantity of meat in both dishes was small too compared to the vegetables.   Overall, the food was good and I would go back but it was not 5 stars.",

    "text": "Of the two Thai restaurants that I've tried in Charlotte, Thai Taste definitely ranks much higher than the other.  Every dish I've tried from red curry to green curry to pad thai to jasmine rice dishes has left a smile on my palate.  I typically order one of the curries over the other dishes, though, because it's rare that I get to have curry when dining out.    During one visit, one of my friends ordered a Thai iced tea and suggested I try it.  I did, expecting something of a green tea variety.  I know this may sound ignorant and I like to think of myself as somewhat of an international foodie, but I was surprised to find that the Thai iced tea came out looking like a creamy orange iced coffee.  I tried it...and I've been hooked ever since.  And since then, I've tried other Thai icea teas (including the canned variety sold at World Market) but no place has yet to compare.  Thai Taste's Thai iced tea has the right amount of sweetness and smoky flavor that others don't.  SO delicious!  I could drink glass after glass...if I ignored the calorie content that each probably has.  Their prices for dinner are a little on the higher side than I'd like, so I typically reserve Thai Taste for lunch.  They have fantastic lunch deals.  For under $10, you can get a delicious Thai dish, Jasmine rice, soup, spring roll, and an iced tea!   The only problem is that they're not open for lunch on Saturdays.  Bummer.  You could combine shopping at Paper Skyscraper on the weekend with lunch at Thai Taste (they're in the same plaza).",

The only reason I am giving Thai Taste 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service leaves something to be desired. Very slow and not very attentive. Generally, we just get take-out (and for that, I'd give 5 stars.)",

I love it when a restaurant does not try to make up for average food with excessive decor...Thai Taste is your basic bare bones, lacking on style, but OH is the food ever so tasty, restaurant!  I got the curry chicken - I think it is called Gang Pang ? ;) and I got it with 4 of 5 stars heat - could have gone hotter but it would have made me sweat.  The only thing I wish was that they served about half a scoop of rice more with your dish - ran out on the last three or four bites of main dish - no biggy.  Lunch was served quickly, waters came out even faster with an extra pitcher of water for the table - nice touch.  I will go back for sure!",

Also the interior is a little cramped up with not much elbow room between tables. It must be about as wide as a train compartment. While we were there, they always had a lot of take out packs waiting at the counter so other people might be sharing my opinions about the service / crowded interiors too? But I repeat, the food is MIND BLOWING. We had the spring roll appetizer which was just okay. For entrees we had the Pud Met Ma Muang (cashew nut) with duck. The duck was delicious. It was crispy and full of flavor. We will definitely be back to try more variety (or maybe just keep ordering the duck?) but I definitely do recommend this place.",

So much so that they know who I am when I call in my order and when I dine-in they walk up to my table with a smile and can tell me what I will order. My staples are the chicken Pud Thai and the fried dumplings (can't recall the Thai name). I've tried the pad see ew and fried rice which were pretty good too. If you go during lunch they offer a cup of complimentary soup that is pretty tasty too. What are you waiting for? Walk in today for some great Thai food.",

And DELICIOUS! A little more sweet than heat but enough heat to cause the occasional sniffle.  I just had to also order their house Fried rice. I opted for beef as I already had a chicken dish. This was decent but not nearly as good as the chicken dish. I had to add a little soy sauce to bring out the flavors. But it WAS good. I guess I've eaten at so many great Thai places around the Continent that my expectations were a tad higher.  One criticism is the lack of a decent wine list! With Asian food they should have some semi sweet whites by the glass to choose from. They didn't, unless you count White Zin in that category. I don't. A simple Cali Riesling or German Spatlese would work.  Overall Thai Taste did not disappoint! I will definitely be back to try their more traditional Pad Thai dishes that everyone raves about! Based on what I had I'd definitely recommend Thai Taste.",

The red coconut curry is fine on taste, however the pad Thai is too dry, typical for this dish as it is difficult to make. Other restaurants provide a lemon wedge to cut the dry peanut flavor, not the case at Thai Taste.
