The space in intimate, very British in decor, and with the high ceilings, an enjoyable place to meet friends.  $4 Boddingtons were the special, and they really poured it nicely (think Guiness at Tyber Creek nice!). Prices were high for shots (4 royal flushes = $36 without tip), but then again this isn't the place you'd normally do shots anyway. Bar tender was nice, but absent and it took a while to get our checks and have her give change. I'd go back, but this won't be my local bar anytime soon.",

My coworker tried a turkey wrap that he said was good but not great.  For a lunch venue, it's not bad.  We had efficient and friendly service.  We were in an out fairly quick.  Prices were reasonable for the Dilworth/SouthEnd area.  Their beer list looked great.  If I go back, and I probably will, I'd go back for happy hour instead of lunch.",

So a little walk from the place and a quick ride to the stop just a short walk to the pub makes this a nice little get away from the center city.  For this particular evening it was Tuesday night pub quiz and we sat outside to get away from it.  Unfortunately, they blasted it on the speakers outside so that was a real disappointment.  It was great to see the place packed on a Tuesday night, but not everyone was there to hear the guy tell cheese jokes as he moved through the trivia questions.  We has an appetizer and a few beers (which were discounted this evening) so all and all a nice night and a nice price at a nice place.",

And then we waited... and waited... and waited. Finally we gave up. No water. No server. Though there was a friendly gentleman that was closing up the patio that said \"thank you, have a good night\". Not sure what he was thanking me for though.

    "text": "I had dinner here on Friday and was quite pleased with the atmosphere and the food. My cousin and I each got the Haddock Sandwich and it far exceeded my expectations. The batter was perfectly done on the outside making for a crunch sought after by many sub-par establishments. With two large pieces of fish overflowing off of a kaiser and a side of steak fries this was plenty and the price suited the portion. My girlfriend went with the Cottage Pie which I had never heard of but it appears to be almost identical to a Shepherd's Pie without lamb. I can't imagine there being much of a difference other than the price but then again I've never been a huge fan of lamb. Again, this Cottage Pie was a great portion for the price.  Our waiter was very attentive throughout the entire meal and was quick to make sure we were kept well-hydrated (with beer). What appeared to be the manager kept making rounds to each of the tables and was genuine in the way he asked each group if everything was okay etc. It helped that there was a great band playing some great music although the volume could have been a tad lower (to be fair it wasn't really dinner time, we got there pretty late).  Overall I was very happy here and very happy with both the Haddock Sandwich and Cottage Pie selections. Next time I'm going to have a hard time making an alternate selection since I was so happy with the sandwich. It helps too that this place is walking distance to many other spots (including my house) such as Ice House and Tyber Creek for those looking to check out a few other places after giving some English fare a go.",

With the Haddock, it was well prepared and this is to say the moisture of the fish and the breading and frying process can be tricky. These guys were on point and the delivery and presentation was very good to excellent (as pictured). The fish was fresh and the fry was crispy. In all, it was a nice experience and I will definitely be back to have the haddock and chips again and explore the menu more. On a final note, seeing some of the other plates coming out of the kitchen looked very good too",

The new building is kind of unique and sits right on the light rail/trolley line.  It must be fun to sit outside and watch the trains/trolley go by.  Anyway, I've been here a few times for lunch and it never disappoints.  The Haddock and chips is supurb and best with malt vinegar which is supplied.    The service here is outstanding as well.  I've had the same server multiple times and she's friendly, courteous and ready to explain when is best on the menu.  The atmosphere of the restaurants has memorabilia from the UK but I did find it odd that the last visit the music playing was Billy Joel.  Shouldn't it have been Elton John?  ;)  Another great thing about Big Ben's.  They support the LGBT community...note the equality stickers on every door!",

Its a really nice set up and the atmosphere feels very cozy.  For lunch, they had great lunch specials (for $5.50) and it included 5 choices!  Their menu is so huge and very diverse.  Including your traditional English pub fare of fish and chips, bangers and mash, and shepherds pie.  I had the beef stroganoff over rice and it was pretty good.  Nothing tremendously special, and I was left wishing I had gone for the fish and chips instead.  I have heard great things about that.    I will be back here to try something else and the prices and atmosphere are really nice.  The service was great and it was fairly busy for a mid day late lunch.  Which is always a great sign.",

Don't ever recall having haddock, so it was going to be a new experience. I tried not comparing my plate to the plate I had in Ireland last year. I thought that would be unfair. The first thing my wife said, \"that doesn't look as good as the one in Ireland\".    The taste was ok. Kind of bland in an English way. No soul or personality to it. My fish in Ireland tasted like there was a story to it. Like the oil it was fried in, was the same since the turn of last century. I was stunned by how good that was. That's why I didn't want to compare. But it was hard not to.    My wife had a curry dish that was quite lovely. Very tasty.    The service was bland, so I guess that was the theme. Very nice waitress, but she left us alone, and not in a good way.     All in all, I believe this was another first and last for us.",

I went to Big Ben one Sunday night primarily because it was within walking distance of Tremont Music Hall, where I was going to a concert later that night. I ordered a steak and kidney pie, a glass of Crispin (which happened to be on special that night, conveniently), and a slice of their sweet potato maple layered cheesecake.   The pie was all right, but I discovered I wasn't a big fan of kidney. Definitely should've gone for steak and mushroom instead. The sides that came with it were fine, but nothing special.   The cheesecake, on the other hand, was very good. However, I'm not sure it was quite worth $8 a slice.  In the end, the food was all very filling, but nothing special and not worth what I paid.",

We asked about the salad dressings and we were told she thought they had the normal stuff other places have. Great answer!! My wife asked if any were made in house? She said she doubted it. That set the tone and we asked to speak to a manager. The hostess came to speak to us and she was very pleasant and apologetic and embarrassed by our server. We asked for another waiter and it suddenly became respectful and enjoyable. Towards the end of our meal the owner arrived and approached our table to ask if everything was ok. We told her about the experience and she offered a half baked apology. We proceeded to over tip our new waiter just to prove a point. The actual point is we'll never, ever visit again!!",

I was a little late to the party, but I was able to park pretty easily - the Atherton Mill shopping center had plenty of parking.  As soon as I walked in, it was welcomed with an immediate cozy feeling.  People were having a good time enjoying each other and the atmosphere.  We ordered food and our server was very attentive - glad to see that everyone was able to celebrate 2013, including the staff after all the champagne was passed out.

    "text": "I had the \"fish 'n chips,\" (haddock) which was about $13. Were they the best fish 'n chips that I've ever eaten? Ummm, no - not even close. They were average. And for $13, one would think that there would be two pieces of fish, perhaps? 3/5.  The waitress supplied malt vinegar and ketchup without being asked, so I was impressed by that. I love malt vinegar on my fish 'n chips. If you've never tried this - you should.  The fish 'n chips were good, but not as good as I was expecting after reading all the \"OMG, these are the best fish and chips on the planet\" reviews and anticipating my visit for three years - admittedly, my expectations were sky high.    The fries were average, but I did like the fact that they were the thicker version. 3/5.  The coleslaw had no mayonnaise, so I found it to be below average. 2/5.  The tartar sauce that came with the meal was outstanding - it tasted homemade. There were capers in the tartar sauce, which is something that I do at home when I make tartar sauce. (FWIW, I also add lemon pepper, dill weed, and a smidgen of cayenne to my version.) 5/5.  I was going to order a Guinness, but I said the heck with it, and just ordered my usual, sweet tea with lemon. Their sweet tea wasn't sweet enough, but I remedied that with Equal. 4/5.  None of the above stopped me from eating everything and cleaning my plate. ;o)  Service? Outstanding. Friendly. Cordial. Professional. Timely.  My server was a lady in her 40's, and she was simply excellent. She would not been out of her depths in a Michelin three star restaurant. 5/5.  Decor? Faux UK.  There WAS a soccer game on the telly, but I couldn't see it from my table.   The music? Sinatra, which I think of as New York or Vegas, not Manchester or Bristol. It was incongruent, but strangely enough, I liked hearing ole' blue eyes croon. (I didn't know that he did a cover of \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!) ;o)  Parking? Adequate. 3/5.  The place was easy to find since it's located right off South Blvd. 4/5.  The Charlotte light rail system almost runs through the bar, so if I lived in Charlotte, I would be a regular here. (Tremont station)  Don't get the wrong impression, I'm not saying that this is a bad place - we've just been introduced. I would guess that this is a GREAT place to grab a Guinness with friends.   I was surprised that there weren't many people here for lunch on a Friday. I counted nine diners, including myself.   I would like to return and try some more authentic British food, such as their version of shepherd's pie, sausage sarnie, and bubble and squeak. This is the type of place that has been know to \"grow\" on me, so I was not disappointed with my first visit.",

They do a great fish and Chips probably the best in Charlotte and I highly recommend trying it, their pies are also pretty close to what I am used to, Breakfast does need a little work as does the Sunday lunch and if they improved these i would eat here a lot more, I recommend getting the Crispin its a great Cider and one of the few places in Charlotte to have it on tap.

Menu has ample choices of traditional British fare including Shepherd's Pie, Bangers(sausage links) and Mash, Steak&Kidney Pie, Chicken Curry, lamb and roast beef platters. Breakfast, dessert, and kids menus as well.  Good service from two servers who kept tabs on us till closing, live music, and $10 top shelf shots made for a fun night.  It's worth a look.",

    "text": "I'll start off this review with a \"Please come back to Myers Park!!!\"  This staple moved to South End after their quaint cottage on Providence Rd. burned down several years ago and unfortunately it just hasn't been the same since they moved to Atherton Mill.   The food is good, this time around it was fish and chips. Huge portion of perfectly fried haddock with a big 'ol pile of steak fries. The food was topped off with a mini British flag and a side of slaw. It went great with a pint of Boddington which was $4.50 on special.   The service was also very friendly and there was a oddly funny musical duo performing reworked hits on keyboard and a guitar. Think back to that SNL skit with Will Ferrell and Ana Gastyer. Unfortunately the place was nearly dead, which doesn't seem good for a Friday night.   The place is unlike anything else in town. But unfortunately the space just doesn't seem to fit the concept like it did in its old spot.   I remember fun trivia nights on the old patio and celebrating British New Year (at 7 PM rather than midnight) in the cozy side room. Now that space is a Sprint store. I think Big Ben's could really hit it big again with a change of scenery.",

    "text": "When we arrived only a few tables were taken, but unknown to us, a Chelsea vs. Manchester City soccer match was about to start and the place was buzzing with people within 15 minutes. We started with the Bubble & Squeak appetizer. This traditional English dish consists of mashed potatoes and sauteed Brussels sprouts, but here they substituted cabbage. The dish had a great consistency and was very tasty. For our meal, my wife went with the Famous South-end Haddock N' Chips and I took our waiter's suggestion, the Chicken Pot Pie.   The Chicken Pot Pie was definitely a unique dish. Rather than the traditional pot pie served in some universal type of container, this pot pie was formed inside of an exceptional puff pastry type shell which held in all of the goodness of the dish. It was served with fluffy mashed potatoes, fresh steamed vegetables, and topped with chicken gravy.   The Haddock N' Chips was far larger than most persons could eat at one sitting. Luckily, my wife was willing to share. It consisted of flaky haddock, cooked to perfection, crispy pub fries, Cole slaw, and a pickle that they call a Wally which in England means a \"dill pickled baby cucumber\". The fish was great, not greasy nor overly fishy. The pub fries were cooked flawlessly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the average Cole slaw complemented the dish.  So, our takeaway...if you're not a soccer fan, ask to be seated outside the viewing area of the huge screen or you'll feel like you're at the game. And go early. We snagged a parking spot right in front, but when we left, vehicles were lined up, circling. Oh, and if you like a coffee after your meals, be sure to stop in Not Just Coffee, located on the back side of Icehouse right next door and wander around the indoor farmer's market.  I would rate this establishment 5 spoons out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

    "text": "First, just because this is a 2 star review does not mean I don't like this place. It's got a great bar, and while there are way too many TVs, there is some semblance of British authenticity. I am half British and emigrated from the U.K. a long time ago. My \"beef\" (bad pun) is with the completely horrible roast beef and inauthentic Southern style spongecake-thing they called yorkshire pudding. The squares of beef looked like they had been sitting around for a while, so it more resembled teriyaki with its darkish sauce. This is listed on the menu as \"roast beef/yorkshire pudding with gravy.\" There was no gravy on the yorkshire pud because it wasn't that - by a long shot. How can you put gravy on a sponge muffin? Combined with slow service - the waitress disappeared for a long time after we were seated so we didn't even have drinks for 15 minutes - I would recommend this restaurant take its own pulse, because the the food and service have plummeted drastically, compared to what I have experienced before. To be fair, I did not complain, because I was in a group. If it were just us two, I would have asked for the manager.  My husband also complained the fish and chips wasn't good, and usually is, but again we did not complain to management. I'm posting this as an \"FYI\" in hopes they can resume their former quality. And if management reads this, I would welcome a reply.",

    "text": "As usual, the lying cow on my GPS insisted I was at my destination and I was not.  Thanks to perseverance and a female's uncanny ability to read maps (ha!), I was able to find this great little spot.  (thank you Yelp photos!)  Dark wood, low lighting, lots of British items (including Union Jack ties on the wait staff) - this was right up my alley.  And speaking of alley, that is where you enter - not under the signage.  My waitress was friendly and helpful, though I am low maintenance, so I am pretty easy to please as long as you remember I am sitting there.  At an early 6:00 on a Wednesday night before a holiday (July 4th), the crowd was sparse for dining, though the bar seemed to have a pretty lively bunch.  They had some $4 pint specials (I believe it was Guiness, though I don't drink so I wasn't paying attention).  Also, Wednesday has half price appetizers.    The food: Cottage pie ($12):  Ground beef, peas, carrots and onions in a beefy gravy, covered with mashed potatoes and topped with melted cheese.  Very well flavored and not overly salty.  It is hard to do a cottage pie to my liking and this was delicious.  Though unevenly heated, some spots were molten hot and others were room temp, it was a very good dish that I would definitely order again.   Bubble and squeak ($4) - A pan seared mashed potato cake with cabbage in it.  I like colcannon from the Irish, so I was hoping this was kind of like that.  Alas, it was a mashed potato cake with a little cabbage in it.  It was kind of salty to me.  But, different.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.  I did however eat every bit like I wasn't going to get food ever again because I like white food groups with a pan sear on them.    On the far right side of Atherton Mill, there was plenty of parking, even directly in front of the pub.  If you are heading towards uptown and exit the parking lot on the same side that Big Ben's is on, you can catch a stop light to get back onto South Blvd rather than trying to cross all of the traffic.  Wonderful little spot, I shall return!  (the food is better than the pictures I have posted would have you believe - I try to not use my flash inside of restaurants, as to not disturb other people with the weird fat girl taking pictures of her food, and this is a dark bar, so the pictures were bleh).",

    "text": "A great selection of British beers and British food, Big Ben is the best in Charlotte for as close to proper English food as an American palate can determine. My wife is an UK import and she gives Big Ben the thumbs up.  Ordering from the dinner menu, we started off with a Scotch Egg (a boiled egg encased in a sausage wrapper then briefly fried) which was served with English relish. After that was cleared, our dinner arrived. I had a cottage pie, which was excellent. Plenty of meat and vegetables and actual (not from packet) mashed potatoes. My wife enjoyed the lamb dinner, which was a medium size pile of sliced lamb with steamed veggies and potatoes, covered in a zingy brown gravy. (On previous visits, I found the chicken curry to be very flavorful and not too spicy.)  Desserts were the only place where Big Ben lets it down. The Sherry Trifle was labeled as \"traditional\" but it seemed to be mostly canned whipped cream with very few lady's fingers. It was way too sweet and we ended up sending it back.  For two, with one appetizer, two entrees, three beers (one domestic, two imports) and a dessert, our tab was $70. While the food and service was great, this seems a little on the high side.  On some nights, they have music in the downstairs lounge. Even with the door closed, the smoke comes up from there as well as too much of the loud music. If that bothers you, try sitting on the other side of the restaurant. There's also a full bar if you just want drinks and (warning: English ahead) crisps.  They have a small parking behind the place and you're not supposed to park on the street. Overflow parking is across the street and down the hill, next to the Bank of America. It's clearly labeled but I think it could use a bit more lighting at night.  All told, a four star place. When we want to eat English, we're here!",

Really enjoyed my fish and chips, but for an \"authentic\" British Pub, I was disappointed that I couldn't substitute mushy peas (a $3 side item) for cole slaw (also a $3 side item) for my entree. I've had mushy peas with my fish and chips all over London. I've never been served cole slaw with them in the UK before. They seriously ought to consider giving you an option. They take so many steps to seem authentic, but they totally blow it by not allowing authentic sides with the fish and chips.  Still, service was good. We'll be back. Hopefully they'll get it together on offering fish and chips with mushy peas, the way you'd really get it in London.",

The food was very good though the wait was almost 40 minutes after ordering --seemed a bit excessive being as we arrived at 11:30am and we were the only people in there; there were only 5 of us.  The pub itself has a very old-school British pub feel --probably the most authentic I've seen since living in the states for over 12 years.  It was pretty dark, with accent lighting and had a stale ale kind of smell.  Yes, the stale ale smell 'IS' required if you want to make the 'authentic British pub' feel.  Though this might not sound too appealing, it really adds to the atmosphere and isn't as bad as it sounds :)  There was a lot on the menu I wanted to try; however, there is only so much one can cram into one's mouth during a Friday lunch session --at least without having to taking a nap when returning to work.  I will be visiting here again and look forward to sampling more of their traditional style foods.  I will certainly update this review after another visit.",

I saw one server wearing a Union Jack tie, and thought \"Oh, how quirky, it must be ironic.\" Then I saw 3 more and realized, \"Oh, you poor things, that's your uniform.\" Look, I get it, it's a British pub but really? You can't make me believe that British bartenders all wear flag ties. The decor was also a little too kitschy for me- while I could believe that pubs in the UK may have their flag on display, I hardly think it's one with Prince William's wedding picture on it.  Come on.  Ok, all that aside, I still had a good experience. I went with the haddock sandwich, which while I enjoyed it, was quite messy and fell apart in my hands. It wasn't really poorly made, there was just so much fish it was hard to stay in one piece. I'll definitely stick with regular fish & chips next time. Chips (fries, whatever) were nice and hot, with both malt vinegar and ketchup offered. (I won't lie, I used both. Sorry.)  Bar service was excellent, bartender recommended Warsteiner Oktoberfest over the more popular Sam Adams, and it was an excellent choice. There were a few more foreign beers on there I'm eager to try.   Haven't been here yet? What's your deal?",

What ultimately made me give only 3 stars is that when I returned for the amazing fish and chips I had a month previously,  I soon realized they had changed their recipe and that I now was eating a much smaller, almost fish stick like fish and chips and well, the service was even worse. For the price and inconsistencies,  I doubt I will be back.",

Ok, so ended up here on Thanksgiving after driving around forever trying to find some place open to eat. Kudos to Big Ben for being open and not just having a prix fixe turkey menu that day. Everything was available.  It's a cozy little place with an inviting staff.  Decent beer specials and the food is pretty good. The fish and chips are solid and you get a ton of food. They offer a decent breakfast too. I had the traditional English breakfast and i left stuffed. Its convenient to the light rail as well so it's easy to stop in for a few drinks or food on the way downtown.",

    "text": "I've been visiting Big Ben every week for well over a year and a half, as they were gracious enough to take in Bob Bair and the Tuesday trivia folks (they should still be thanking RiRa for that).  Food- funny, folks say that British food is boring and bland.  If that is the case, then BB is not authentic, because everything is DELICIOUS!  I've had just about everything on the menu- from a burger to pasty to the Sunday roast, and it has all been excellent.  They also have various entrees featured as monthly specials, and sometimes I wish a few of them would make the regular menu.  Fish and chips are lovely, though I have not had them (I do not eat fish), but everyone that I know that has had them has always liked them.  Beer- BB has a decent beer selection, many are pub favorites.  They also have some decent specials throughout the week.  However, I'm withholding a star for one reason: the beer list needs some updating.  I am so sick of the same old beers that have been on the menu since this new location opened.  I'd like to see some variety...see some taps rotate every now and then.  There is this huge craft beer market out there, and in this neighborhood, you have got to be able to keep up!  It's gotten to the point where I hardly order a beer anymore because the options are so exhausted (Fat Tire, Stella, Guinness...).  If rotating out taps won't work, at least rotate some bottle selections.  :)  PS- \"Newcastle IPA\" does not count.  Service- Typically quite good.  The only spot where they struggle is when there has been some turnover.  Probably would be a good idea to partner a newbie with a seasoned server (or at least have the seasoned server check up on the table), as it gets a little frustrating.  The rest of the team is awesome, namely: Lucky, Angie, and Laura (? Bubbly brunette, maybe I got her name wrong??). We rarely sit at the bar but I do recognize the long haired bartender, he's been there for ages, and he has always been nice.  Other pros- location...next to the light rail.  Prices are fair!  Desserts are scrumptious. I also am a big fan of their breakfast (wish it was offered on Tuesday nights...).  Big Ben is also an excellent place to watch any and all soccer matches (EPL, UEFA, World Cup, Euros, you name it).  Make a reservation for the big matches, as the place gets packed!!",

We went for a walk last night around our neighborhood and this place caught my eye because of the sign that said \"Well Wednesday\" all well drinks $3!  Ok, in we went.  It was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  Whiskey and Coke for him and Whiskey Sour for me.  They came out quick, were decent sized but my Sour lacked a cherry which is a minor detail but I secretly really wanted one.  We decided to share the Fish and Chips cause we weren't super hungry, it was ok.  The fries were better than the fish I thought.  We got talked into dessert and chose the Bread and Butter pudding.  This is where 2 of the 2.5 stars come from.  It was AMAZING, warm with raisins some kind of heavenly sauce and whipped cream.  Yum.  One more drink was ordered and we got our bill.  They charged $2 extra for an extra plate because we shared the meal.  This makes me mad because they didn't state this beforehand.  If I didn't make it obvious we were sharing and just ate off the one plate would you have added the $2?  As my Dad would say because of that it's an OTOTO.  One time, one time only kind of place!",

Even with that handicap, we haven't had to wait unduly for drinks or food. The servers are competent and friendly, especially Lucky.   I have yet to get a dish that wasn't very good. The fish and chips and black and blue salad are my two favorites.   My only nibbling qualms include the tight space (might just be on quiz night) and no change in the nightly special- Tuesday has been fish and chips (delightful) and $4 pints of Sierra Nevada (meh).",

Going there early on a Monday evening was also a mistake almost empty and so the lack of ambiance was way too apparent. Anyway fish and chips on Friday night is propably a good bet.",

Both of us had the Hearty breakfast plate. While not exactly cheap at $10.00, it is quite filling and tasty, consisting of 2 eggs, bacon, beans, grilled tomato and mushrooms, and let's not forget the banger ( sausage) and toast. The eggs were actually served as ordered ( over easy) banger (sausage) was flavorful,  and the bacon was meaty, closer to a Canadian bacon. If you are looking for a breakfast with southern biscuits or pancakes this is not the place for you. If you are looking for something a little different then consider this as a possibility.    Our server took our orders and kept our drinks topped off, brought out condiments without being asked. so gets 4 of 5 stars here as well, hard to believe only three tables occupied .All in all worth the dollar or two more than an ihop or denny's.",

Not necessarily the case and it was definately True this evening.  We could not hear our server so we had to point out our order. I had the haddock sandwich with steak fries and sweet tea.  My wife had a black and blue steak salad.  She loved her's but mine was lacking. The haddock had a mealy texture to it with little taste. The Steak Fries were under cooked and raw in the middle.  Maybe an off night because I've dined here several times over the years and had generally enjoyed it. Not the case tonight.

Last time I went they got my boyfriends order wrong and I finished my meal before they brought his out. It was supposed to be a steak and mushroom pie and there was no steak in it. Both times they comped the pies, but since I've only eaten here four times that's getting orders right half the time.  I would recommend this place if you are looking for something slightly different, or a good filling meal. The Cornish Pasty is a new favorite of mine.",

No one bothered me as I played UNO on my phone and drank my beer. At one point, I cashed out to go meet her stylist. When I came back, Charlie remembered me and the beer I had been drinking.  The decor was decent and it was amusing to watch a replay of the Winter Olympics from the viewpoint of the UK. I would not make a special trip to Big Ben, but I would definitely stop in again if I am in the area and looking for a beer.",

    "text": "Overall:  - For the food alone, 98% of the menu is incredibly delicious and the kitchen staff seem very kind. A couple things aren't good, but the menu is great otherwise for 5 Stars there and for their kitchen staff. - For the service from bartenders and servers, 70% are great. But about 5 of 13 and their bus-boy are terrible.  - For management, as I've mentioned, they are insane and do not know how to please customers and think if they do ANYTHING for them, whether it's replacing a meal, giving a slight discount, or a free dessert, they strut like they've done the best work in their life (and they let you know it). And also, don't bother complaining about anyone, especially the 30% of the bad servers or the bus-boy who has an attitude with everything from the trash can to the lovely newlyweds that were just sat).  - The prices are high. Granted, portions are huge for a lot of things, but most items are good reheated. If you order anything that has gravy or a sauce on it, ask for it on the side so if you do take it home it won't be soggy and you can reheat it better. And reheat anything from there in the oven if possible. Pretty much 375* for 5-8 minutes does the trick for. The drinks are high too. Most drafts are $6-$7 for a pint....some are a 20 oz cup, some are 16 oz.....it's just not consistent and the most expensive draft is the Red Clay Cherry Cider that comes in maybe 12 ozs for $7!!!! That's crazy expensive.   To sum it up: Food is decent and authentic. However, the experience as a whole is pretty bad. Most of the servers are great, but there are a couple bad seeds that can ruin your dining experience from genuinely not caring about your experience. Management is INSANELY TERRIBLE. There are two managers, the owner and the chef, equally unapproachable and they will not compensate or replace anything for you. They make it seem like whatever is going on is your fault and guilt you for it. If they do happen to do something to replace a wrong/bad item, they act like they've given you the world. So, I hope you don't have to ask for a manager to help you. I really think with 2 new managers and replace the bus-boy and like 3-5 bad/rude servers, you may have a good thing going. It's also always hot there. ALWAYS hot. They always say the fans are \"broken\" and act like the air conditioner doesn't exist. Don't waste your time.",

We went on a Friday night, and this place was empty.  They had live music, which was good, but a little loud for a dinner crowd (8pm).  I ordered the Fish n' Chips.  I really enjoyed the fish, the fries (chips) were pretty good as well.  I couldn't help but think that I could have gotten the same thing at a seafood restaurant for significantly less money.  My wife got the Haddock sandwich.  We had the same feeling about the sandwich as we had with the Fish n' Chips:  It was good, but on the pricey side for what it was.  The thing that locked this review into a Three star, rather than a possible Four star, review, was the fact that they added the tip into our bill.  What!!!!  We had 6 people at our table, three couple's.  I don't know why it bothered me so much, but it did.  So they get Three Stars.",

Interesting art work/decorations with plenty of British/irish flair.  They have gobs of good ol' English/Irish fare.  We went with the simple Eggs over Buttered Toast & I got mine poached for some good, oozy yolks over my toast.  The potatoes were nicely small & done well, with some crispy ones, too (my favess)!

The fish and chips however were the real disappointment. Again, the fry was great but the whole dish desperately needed salt. Both the fish and the fries were totally flavorless.

It definitely resembles a traditional pub in England, slightly dark, very old, and a True love for all things Union Jack.   As for food, I can only attest for some appetizers, but both the Scotch eggs and bubble and squeak were spot on and delicious. If you've never had a scotch egg, I highly recommend trying it. It's a hard boiled egg rolled in breakfast sausage and fried (or sometimes baked). The bubble and squeak was of generous portion and equal parts sprouts and mashed.   Overall, I enjoyed popping in here and would certainly come back to try a traditional dinner.",

Three beers for around $20. When did a pint of Birdsong become $6.50?   I dig the British pub vibe. Yeah, baby! (obligatory Austin Powers remark)There's a small stage, small dining room and what almost feels like a much larger outdoor space. Lots of TVs with sports.  Great Southend location. John assures me this is a cool place to come for New Years and has a full English Breakfast on weekends.  There is this really cool pitcher behind the bar that looks like \"The Donald\".",

Not wanting to give up our prime parking space, we stopped into Big Ben.  The place was mildly busy but there were plenty of seats at the bar.  The bartender was very helpful with suggestions.  I ordered the Manchester Mule: Hendricks Gin, St. Germain liqueur, simple syrup, ginger beer with a splash of grapefruit juice. OH MY...was my drink good!!  My friend ordered the Palace Lemonade: Deep Eddy Lemon, muddled blueberry, simple syrup and lemonade; which was also very tasty.    The gentleman next to me ordered the bourbon chicken salad which smelled and looked amazing.  I will definitely return to have another mule and sample the food.  I've already scoped out the menu and I'm looking forward the Tin Miner's Cornish Pasty and the Haddock N' Chips.",

Not sure if it is on during the winter but gotta love those old touches. I got the fish and chips and it was good.  Be sure to ask for extra tartar sauce because they give you a thimble-full. Also, I got the fish & chips here before and it was greasy. It depends on who's cooking. So, take a look at the fish served on other tables before ordering to see if it looks crispy and non-greasy. We got potato soup.  It was REALLY delicious. My fiance got the cottage pie.  He said it was a bit small of a portion, and he's a small eater... so that's saying something.  I like the fact that they have Blue Moon on draft. The British flags on the entrees are adorable.",

Turns out that appetizers were $6 on Mondays so I was able to try a few things! I started out with a Moscow mule which was good then ordered the sausage rolls, meat pies, and buffalo/curry wings. The sausage rolls were basically just a puff pastry and sausage but the chutney that came with it was delicious on top. The meat pies were my favorite and basically like a mini pot pie with meat, vegetables, and potatoes in a puff pastry with a gravy. My husband ate the wings and he said they were okay but the best part of the buffalo and the best part of the curry kind of cancelled each other out. In regards to service, it left some to be desired. We were sat in the same section of tables as the four other parties in the restaurant leaving a major part completely unoccupied and all of us feeling on top of each other. The server disappeared for a bit so we only ended up having one drink each. I would definitely be back again because it's always a unique experience.",

    "text": "Big Ben British Restaurant & Pub has a very nice big sign, and decor on their building that really caught my eye. I went in somewhat excited to try a new place that neither me nor my friends had gone to before. Alas I left feeling a bit conflicted and confused.  The Host was wearing a chef jacket, I thought that was a little odd. He seemed like he didn't really want to be there either, but I don't really care. We were seated pretty quickly, and given menus to look over. Our waitress was a sweetie. She was pretty patient with us as we figured out what we wanted to order, and was able to answer questions my sister had about allergies.   The decor of the restaurant was pretty cool. Flags everywhere, pictures of british culture everywhere. Usually the restrooms of these kinds of places have pictures of neat things, or little jokes about the culture that the restaurant is representing. I'm not sure I remember if there even a mirror on the wall because of what I walked into. Ladies room needs work. The handicap stall isn't really needs friendly with a broken toilet paper dispenser. The seats are so old that they're yellowing and peeling and the caulk around the bases and floor are dirty and broken. There was a screw next to the faucet on the sink just laying there pooling rust. I was happy that they had soap and paper towels, but the owner or management needs to invest some time and money in to their facilities.  Anyway back to the food, I ordered a Chicken Pot Pie with sides of house veggies and mashed potatoes. The crust looked pretty. The edges almost looked braided, so I saved it for last. I took a bite of mashed potatoes, and they were flavorless. I was a bit taken aback, so I took a bite of my veggies, again no salt. \"Well, there's pie crust, it has butter in it or lard, so it has to be salty... right?\" ALAS! Not a grain of salt could be tasted. I thought that there was some mistake so I looked at the faces of the others in my party. They all looked as puzzled as I felt. The food was well made, I might even say flawlessly executed, but the only seasoning on the table, was that which was in the dispensers on the table. For the first time in my adult memory, I picked up the salt and pepper shakers and tried to at least make the blandness tolerable. About halfway through my food, I thought I had taken a bite of my napkin, only to realize it was something quite different. I have made a lot of soups and stews using it, but they forgot to take out the bay-leaf. It's great for flavor, but needs to be removed before being served.    To sum it up, everything needs salt and seasoning. Restroom needs maintenance. Front end staff is okay.",

I had a group of 4 and after three different placed we tried that night either weren't in service or had 1 hour or more wait times, Big Ben had seating ready so we're game. We walk into a very busy and loud dining room. It's the first round of NCAA basketball so I'm not really surprised but be warned that it does get pretty loud here.  My thoughts on the appetizer will echo a lot of what Joshua's 3/25 review says. Started with meat pies. The whole dish had the components for success with the main lacking factor being seasoning. I can understand if the occasional patron complains about a dish being under-seasoned, but when the whole table says it's under-seasoned, it's an issue.  My roast lamb fortunately was well seasoned and paired with a hearty brown sauce. The Yorkshire Pudding served alongside was good when dipped in the sauce, but definitely relied on the sauce. Maybe it's supposed to be dipped in it? Not sure, a lot of unknowns here as far as my knowledge of British Cuisine. Some of my party's dishes turned out again, under-seasoned. Josh actually got a haddock with the most amazing breading that I've ever seen, and it was a shame that it was bland.  The more I think about it, I think we should have said something to the restaurant about some of the dishes. Between being exhausted and this being our fourth option for dinner, we were OK with what we got. Again, my entree was actually pretty good. I'm struggling between three and four stars. Due to my lack of understanding of British food, I'll give 'em the four. It's a re-visit for me for sure.",

    "text": "This was such a frustrating meal and what makes it worse is that 90% of the issue could have been fixed with little to no effort.   Ended up here Friday night because every other place we tried along the way had a 60+ minute wait and we'd never been here before. Inside was bustling to say the least, but you can't complain about noise in a bar on the weekend. Ordered drinks and my friend ordered appetizers just fine, waitress answered a couple of questions we had. Not too long until the apps came out. Two beef pot pies and an artichoke dip with pita. The pies were the first inclination of something being amiss with the evening. They were piping hot with a nice flaky crust, good ratio of sauce/meat/veggies inside, but it was bland. Specifically the beef was bland. The sauce had some flavor, and the crust wasn't too bad, but it tasted like they put literally nothing in the beef when they cooked it.   Not impressed with the pies, I nibbled on some Pita while we waited for entrees.   Initially when my food hit the table I thought everything was going to turn around. My fish and chips consisted of an absolutely massive piece of haddock and a sizable bed of fries. Beautiful golden brown color, crispy texture, sizzling hot but not dripping with grease. I try a bite and sigh. It is indeed perfectly cooked. Maybe the best combination of crispy breading and tender meat I've ever had in a fried dish. They didn't season the fish though. At all. No salt. No pepper. Nothing. There was some taste to the breading but that was about it. (No salt on the fries either by the way.) I just don't understand. At the price point of some of these dishes not having any seasoning is inexcusable, I don't care how well it was cooked technically speaking. I ate it anyway as I was starving at this point but I don't know if i would return. I cook at home all the time, seasoning a piece of fish take seconds. I just can't justify the cost of coming here when there are so many other delicious places to eat that give you a higher quality experience.",

My chicken pot pie was not done inside. The dough was gummy and under cooked.   We wanted to try a new place and that's shame on us as we know the phrase 'go with what you know' is so True when it comes to eating at places. Total buzz kill for the night unfortunately.   It was a bad experience from just sitting there for 40 minutes to our food being cold and undercooked. Like wtf were they doing back there the whole time!? To our waitress who barely moved her damn mouth to talk.   Just don't go here.",

    "text": "Was over to the new ice cream shack with about 4 dozen friends and as the party was breaking up I remembered I missed dinner. Saw the sign in the distance and decided to go for a walk. Enter off the alley side and it's like dart-bars of my misspent youth outside of Chicago. Dark wood, house lights down low, string-lights up high out of harms way and soft rock filling the empty spaces. Association football on the big screen, and Newcastle Brown on tap. Pull one for starters, linger over it waiting for the meat pies and the rarebit. Yea cheese bread! Light crowd tonight so good for me, I prefer dining in peaceful conditions.  Meat pies were good, simple food and just as described: ground beefs and taters and carrots and peas and rich brown gravy in a pastry puff package. Judging by the flags in my food I'd say the crown has claimed dominion over my dinner. Other than that bit, what's not to like?",

    "text": "By not seasoning their food, Big Ben is committed to perpetuating the stereotype that British food sucks.  Fried fish...great portion and looks awesome, but it's flavorless, only taking on the flavor of the nasty fry oil they use, not fish. I suspect it's a frozen, pre-breaded product. I wonder how often they clean out their fryers and change the oil. Gross. Chicken sandwich...not seasoned and BORING. What does it take to make a good chicken sandwich, for crying out loud?! Just a couple examples.   Bottom line... go for a beer, but skip the food. They just don't prepare tasty food, plain and simple. Doesn't seem as though they know how to motivate their staff or promote themselves. Naive ownership. Staff is really nice but a lot of them have have worked there forever and seem complacent and unaware.",

We grabbed a table right in front of a huge projection screen that they have and immediately started swilling Guinness by the pint. Our waitress checked on us frequently and we finally ordered some grub. I had the Hearty \"Full English\" Breakfast which consists of two eggs, a banger, bacon, beans, hashbrowns/home fries, and grilled tomatoes. I never thought I would have beans for breakfast, but considering it was probably 12:15pm by this time, it was acceptable.   Everything was great, I can see why this is such a popular spot for soccer and also on Panthers game days. Only problem is that it's an Arsenal bar and I'm a Liverpool supporter. YNWA!",

    "text": "Ok, ok. so a British pub along the light rail is bound to be hyped up.  But I'm quite sold on the atmosphere of this place, inside and out.  Though the food and beverage prices are a bit steep, its nice to have a chill hangout with a good patio.  I went on a Friday night and expected mild-to-moderate revelry, but instead I observed a reserved post-college crowd, soccer on the telly, and a reggae singer.  Sounds like a pleasant evening.  I agree with other Yelpers that the new pub doesn't have the charm of the old house.  The interior is pretty cramped and lacks seperate rooms that gave the old restaurant a parlor-like effect.  Instead, the bar and the compact dining area is seperate by a curtained half wall, breaking up this already cramped space.  So, I headed towards the patio and it was golden-the light rail speeds by you and see the neigbors in the condos acoss the street yelling at one another from the balconies.  Perfect place to see urban life.  The staff is very friendly and though understaffed, a server came out to ask my friend and I if we needed anything.  I find that patio-dwellers get ignored at most joints so this was a nice touch.    While the new Big Ben doesn't make a splash on my list of Charlotte hang-outs, I will atleast give it an honorable mention. It does however make for a nice diversion from my tried and True weekend hangouts or a good spot for  launching an evening in Southend.  I look forward to grabbing dinner at Big Ben the next time I see a show at Tremont or Amos'.",

My Dad ordered the steak and mushroom pie and he was raving about it, which really says something because my family is British and my Dad is a total food snob (love you, Dad!)

There were soccer matches on the TVs and the wait staff was more preoccupied with watching the matches than serving their customers.  Finally, we just sat down at a table. After another 10 minutes an elderly gentleman, the proprietor I suspect, waddled over to our table with about 3 TV remotes.  He never even acknowledged us, but rather, adjusted the large TV located directly above us and waddled back into oblivion.  No other wait staff came over even after I waved and made direct eye contact.  The new location is also very cramped and hard to move around in.  The original location had very much a \"pub feel\".  The new location reminds one of an overcrowded, generic sports bar and has the service to match.  Never going back.",

    "text": "I've missed Big Ben's.  The old Big Ben's was one of our perennial favorites. We gazed sadly upon the charred timbers on Providence Road and wondered if we'd ever see the like in Charlotte again.  Well, the answer is yes and no.  I am happy to report that Big Ben's is alive and well at Atherton Mills.  Enter from Tremont and you won't miss it.  Enter from South Bl. and you won't find it.  The big 2000 above the door is misleading. B.B. is through the zig-zig corridor and out the other side of the building. And don't trip over the carpenters.  Meanwhile, back at Big Ben's.  Part of Big Ben's charm was the cozy atmosphere. Well, that's gone up in smoke.  Now, it's a cavernous room with a ceiling about three stories up. Cozy is no longer an apt descriptor.  Also missing is the fireplace. Instead is a fake fireplace with light show flames and coals, and an electric space heater, but the mantle is nice. I've seen it advertised on TV, lovingly hand-crafted by real Amish type workerpersons.  (*Sigh!*)  The menu is pretty much the same. I had a Pasty and my wife had her fave -- Liver and Onions.  Both were delicious as usual. I'm happy to report that the menu survived the fire. Rita's order arrived according to her exact specifications, so the kitchen staff is still on the ball. Our waiter was pleasant, attentive, and kept us happy by not hovering.  Over the years, we've ordered about everything on the menu, so if our visit this time in any indication, you can safely order anything they offer and reasonably expect to be well fed on their typical British fare.  For suggestions, I'd suggest you experiment with the menu offerings. But don't order the fries. Get the homemade potato chips instead. They're good enough to order extra to take home. Don't nuke 'em. Reheat then in the oven, instead. Yummy!  The steaks are really good, but you can get good steaks all over town. Instead get the Lord's Roast Lamb or Haddock and Chips. Save the steaks until you've tried the other menu items.  You can make a meal from the appetizers. Ploughman's Platter or Welsh Rarebit are good places to start.  Why only three stars? I miss the old place. If you've never been to the old Big Ben's on Providence Rd., go ahead and give it another star.  But I'd've put in a balcony or something to bring the ceiling down to give the place a more cozy atmosphere. And lose the fake fireplace.",

There is a huge variety of beer - Pilsner Urquell my fav on TAP!!  But no really great beer specials or happy hour specials on beer.   So it isnt the cheapest place to drink but the food and the cozy atmosphere make up for it.  I have also had the salads here and they are outstanding and reasonably priced.   I would have given this place five stars but I have to mention the few times I have been in here the music choice is horrible.  On these occasions it was some sort of gangster music which one of the waitresses must have picked out cause she pranced around the entire restaurant singing it.  I am all for other's joy and singing while you work I guess but I think this was a bit excessive and she should take her talents to a karaoke bar instead of holding us patrons hostage to her pipes.  But I can't imagine this happens all the time so I definitely will keep going to this place and LOVIN it!  :-D",

Unfortunately, as tempting as the menu looked, we never found out how the food was.  Somehow, the management must have missed the memo that nearly 70,000 soccer fans were in town and reduced their wait  & kitchen staff to only 5 ....because is was \"slow' (during the game..duh!).    We arrived around 10PM  as the crowd was ebbing, got seated & waited for 90 minutes for any morsel of food and despite some desperate measures by the over-whelmed hostess (and single waitress) managed only get drinks (with great confusion) and 2 appetizers.   We finally left following out another VERY angry group of diners after the waitress, upon questioning admitted it might be an additional hour before the meals could be served!  What could have been a banner evening was tarnished by very poor planning on someone's part and very dysfunctional lack of service & coordination.   I think that there is great potential here IF this establishment can get past its lack of preparation for the \"big leagues\"",

They don't care about their clients but rather care about hanging out with other staff members more than service.  They are slow, forget your requests and the managers couldn't care less. The bartenders and servers are great, but they can't do anything without the owners and managers support.  We are not going back after giving this place 6 chances and trying extremely hard to make it our new hangout.  They need a ton of management support, and the wait staff sucks! Cross the street and try Tyber creek or all american pub where the environment is more upbeat, positive and they care about their customers.",

Last night (Tuesdays are \"Trivia Night\") we ate Burgers and Chips (chips as we know in US) [they have fries too], watched the Olympics (many screens) and \"played\" Trivia (I'm no fan and still did alright) It was a lot of fun!  This was our first visit to the \"new\" location, 55 a BIG Fan of the Myers Park (pre-fire) location (I only visited it one time the did have a cool \"cellar\"!  I ate \"Bangers and Mash\" at the other location... Last Night the Burger was GREAT!  Burger of ground Beef gets five yelp stars even though it was not exactly as I ordered it... I said no Cheese, it had cheese, I said Onion, it had no Onion, I said Ketchup it had no Ketchup, three \"strikes\"?  NO!  All of this is easy to fix without sending it back!!!  Our server offered to take it back and get it right, I told her NO, \"I'll fix it!\" and I did! They did get the no Mayo right!!!  It was Great!  I added Ketchup and she brought me a plate of Red Onion, mmmmm, nothing left but plate!!!  These Chips are American style \"chips\" Potatoes thinly (perfectly) sliced, deep fried, (probably the same day then reheated?)  These were the CRUNCHY Crisp style Chips, so if that is what you like you'll probably LOVE these!  Here is what I LOVE and what I should have asked for: : Made to order (right then NOT reheated) more lightly fried and slightly tender!  My yelp rating of these Chips:   Potato Thinness 5 yelp stars  Crunchy Crispness (even though that is not my preference) 5 stars  The service was very good and did not need to be much better as far as we were concerned!  This place looks GREAT, plenty British Pub for me, please do not say it's a Sports Bar, that would ruin it for me and we were watching the Super Heavy Weight Class Weight Lighting (\"Lift Weighting\" as Paul Koehler says).    Enter through the Alley!  Cool Alley Patio, partly covered, shade from Sun, not shelter from rain though!  Cool Light Rail Patio also (opposite side)!  Multiple patios always impresses me!  Why does eating outside seem so Romantic to me, even if I'm alone, even if I'm alone with friends along (you know what I mean right???)  Live Music (wait til you see the stage) Friday and Saturday Evenings!  I'll be checking this out!",

The service was in the top worst experiences I've had in the area and it took over an hour to get a quick bite. The sodas were flat and the fish and chips was a huge piece of fish that was super greasy and mostly fried batter or the skin side of the fish. Won't be coming back here!",

    "text": "I can't believe this was my first time coming here but it was. Came on a Saturday night before the live band started (which we did on purpose). When they seated us it was a little weird that they had us crawl through every person on the right side of the restaurant to seat us in the one table empty in the very middle up under the television. That I was not a fan of!! There were plenty of seats on the other side but we dealt with it.   However the important stuff... on to the food!! We ordered the bubble and squeak, which I surprisingly really liked (think potato cake with cabbage), and a scotch egg (it was okay to me and my friend from London says it's not the best he's had), appetizers for the three of us.  I got the Chicken pot pie as my entree and it was delicious.  My boyfriend got the Tin Miners Cornish pasty, which he liked better than mine and I also liked it (but not better than mind lol). His brother got the Lord's roast lamb which he said was good. We did not try dessert although next time that bread pudding is happening as I hear it's amazing!!  Overall the food was good but not blown away by it. I want to give it 3.5 stars but that's not an option and I really do just think 4 is a tad too much. I'm hoping on my next visit I can up the rating a bit :)",

    "text": "So, I'm in the foodservice business and one time I had to do some nutrition analysis on Welse Rarebit.  Now, knowing what I did about British cuisine I figured it was some sort of offal.  Then I discovered it's really just cheese sauce on toast.  Wow.  Sounds good.  Then I discovered Big Ben and they serve Welsh Rarebit (as well as bubbles and squeak which I remember from Wind in the Willows or something).  They also make a mean Shepherd's pie.  I'm sure the fish and chips is good and it's probably their signature dish, but when I go there I always get a Shepherd's Pie, Beef and Mushroom pie, or some other awesomeness.  Big Ben's is my favorite British pub in Charlotte and if I'm not feeling British I can hop across the street to Tyber Creek and get my Irish on.",

We went on a Friday and there was a live singer who was the best I've heard in the neighborhood.  I had the Tin Miners Cornish Pasty ($14).... ground beef, potatoes, onions & carrots in a puff pastry shell served with mashed potatoes, gravy with mixed veggies. It was homey and fantastic.  Had a couple Guinness with it...   We will be back!  It was great!",

    "text": "Best, and most authentic British Pub in Charlotte.  I would probably give them 5 stars, if they got rid of the corny Union Jack neckties the waitstaff wear.  Their fish and chips are the best in Charlotte - always crispy outside, moist Haddock inside, huge portion as well.  For those that wish the old location had not burned down, forcing the move to SouthEnd: yes, the pub has lost some of it's \"pub\" charm, but let's admit it: it's now a better restaurant.  Excellent cottage pie, tin miners cornish pasty, bangers and mash, and if you're feeling healthy, the black and blue salad.  Nearest place to my house that serves Spaten on tap.  If you happen to be there on a soccer weekend, make sure you don your red and white and pull for The Arsenal!  The pub is the semi-official meeting spot for The Arsenal supporters club, the Queen City Gooners.",

Potatos were dry too. The waiter asked if I wanted to send it back, but I declined because of the wait. My mistake!!! They still charged me  $20...... even after it was obvious I wasn't going to eat it. Poor service guys!",
