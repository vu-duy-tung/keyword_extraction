PITA , the umpteenth time that I drive somewhere only to find the info is obsolete - I notified Yelp about Mily and Lalo two weeks ago and they still haven't corrected it.   The decor is strictly pool tables, lots of tvs and metal chairs, yikes! I sat at the bar. First let down this \"grill\" doesn't have a liquor license, just beer. Ok at least they have New Castle brown and it's cheap not too bad.   The food must be awesome, the barmaid said so! She said it three times in fact.  Well, if your idea of awesome is standard bar fare served in a plastic baskets it is. I ordered the Ruben - which I never do - because I wasn't in the mood to be picky, it was very good and reasonably priced. The fries were over salty I couldn't eat more than half of it. This no gastro-pub: burgers, chicken wings and the traditional sandwiches, no plates - I honestly don't get the raving five star reviews, they raised my expectations way too high. The barmaid was pleasant enough, I ate some peanuts.   All in all I think it's a good place to refuel, have a beer and a bite. That's it.",

Although it was annoying that the wing prices had changed.  There were several disappointing things in the rest of the meal:  1.  The cheesesteak my wife ate was tough and had a bad flavor.  Also, the condiments were very poor.  No Hellman's mayo and no Heinz ketchup.  House Recipe brand sucks! 2.  The hot dog I ordered had an OK flavor but they put it on a bun that had way to much bread.  A hot dog should not be served on a cheesesteak roll.  I just ate the dog without the bun. 3.  Server didn't know how to pour a Guiness.  It should be hard poured (bottle directly upside down) and not titled to the side.  You want a rich creamy head and you don't get it by tilting. 4.  The fries were soggy.",

The wings are great don't miss the whooli sauce and the teriyaki with wasabi ranch for dipping.  My favorite sandwich is the grilled Monterrey Chicken with bacon, mushroom, swiss and ranch, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  On Fridays don't miss the Prime-rib sandwich cooked to order and served with au jus and horseradish.  The beer on tap is always cold and fresh and affordable as well.  Over all you can't go wrong I could sit here and write all day about the huge club sandwiches, Rubens, in house made soups, buffalo shrimp but now I am getting hungry.",

As we were about to leave and pay for our food one of the employees was unable to work the POS system, so the other employee came over. it took a little minute for all of us to get rung up because this employee also had an attitude when we asked for our checks to be split up. She tried to flip the script and say that one of my friends was rolling her eyes and yelled at all of us and told us we can get the f*%# out. she also told us we could pay and that we cou come back for whatever reason.",

No batter or anything to hide the flavor, just really good, different flavors available. Homemade ranch, I think. Good for mushrooms, blue for my wings. I wouldn't go back.

Its a very casual atmosphere.  They have several pool tables and enough TV's. You have seating choices- a picnic table, table with metal chairs, or up at the bar. So don't wear a dress or skirt...getting in and out of the picnic table seating can get embarrassing.   I've had their wings with the Whoolies sauce because that is what everyone says to get, they were good, not my favorite,  but good. I've also had the Whoolies burger (watch out, if you want cheese it will almost be a dollar extra) and it was fine,  again nothing to write home about. The other sandwiches are huge, I can never finish one. I like the curly fries here, the other fries can get a little too salty for me. They only have a few beer selections, but they are decently priced. The staff is friendly enough. They know some people by name and those people get paid attention to the most.    I like how quiet it is on a Saturday afternoon,  so that's when I'd go for a couple of wings and a cheap beer.",

We were starving and filled up on peanuts.  They gave us a coupon for 6 free wings next time, how about at a minimum comping some of the food?

My friend wanted a burger but told her to try the baby whoolis burger, which she enjoyed as it was the size she wanted - quarter pound. If you get the regular, It's a half pound of yumminess, but I would have to take half home. Jana our server was great and made sure our drinks were full and if we needed anything.

It's sad that this is the only thing I get, the owner, Guy, knows that's the only thing I order.  He's determined to get me to try something else, but how can I say no to so much deliciousness?    The place has moved from their original spot, and I quite enjoy the new place. The bar is a lot bigger, and they have a few tv's located around the restaurant for you to watch a game while waiting for your take out.  I love the little detail at the bar that they have their little Irish man ironed/burned (?) into the wood of the bar.  Small details like that are nice.  The place has a homey feel that you're just chilling with friends.  Some of the tables there are picnic tables, so I like that.    The atmosphere is friendly, but sometimes it felt like it can get a little too loud.  But everyone is just there for a good time, so no hard feelings.  There's is also a pool table located there which you can test your skills at.    Try this place out if you're looking for a nice relaxing bar to wind down at for the end of the day!",

Everyone (workers, patrons, cook) is so laid back and friendly.   I had to bring Jon B here for lunch to pop his Whooli's cherry. Our order: a dozen wings (garlic parm and buffalo), a chicken philly, the special Whooli burger, homemade chips, and fries. It was all delicious. I'll tell you right now, that burger is one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Warning: it's a 1/2 lb and two patties. Next time, I'll see if I can do a baby Whooli version of it. Loved how the fries came in a little basket. Also, in case you were wondering, this was in fact way too much food for us. However, it was worth every calorie and being stuffed all day. I'm also a big fan of the Whooli's Special (it's like an Italian type sub). All the food I've had here has been pretty solid.   Bonus: you can order pick up here via Yelp and Eat 24. They also have brunch.",

I was going to order the Italian sub but decided to ask what was the top sandwich/sub there.  The friendly and helpful waitress, Emily suggested the Whooli special (medium).  When she said it had all kinds of meat.  I was sold and thought it would be flavor.  Indeed it was and wasn't disappointed.  I ordered a side of fries.  A large would have been too much even without the fries.  And I usually have a big appetite.  The chips were tasty.  The fries were good.  Definitely coming back.9",

Don't health departments frown on that type of thing??? So, I've tried it, check it off the list and I'll keep moving down the road.",

She is a sweet little dog that's there once in a blue moon for maybe 20 minutes or so and did I mention she is also a therapy dog and has a license! I absolutely adore the Monterey chicken sandwich it is so good!!! It has this pretzel bun on it that is freshly baked it makes the sandwich. They no longer have those buffalo sliders you can only get it in a chicken sandwich. Make sure that when you order something to go via Internet and it asks you what type of bread put in the comments whatever usually goes on it because if you put white they will actually give you white toast or wheat toast etc.  I've never had a bad experience here and if you were to have an issue just talk to the owners they are always there and they will make things right. Give this place a chance it's been around forever for a reason :-)",

Note, this location is a little different and lets say it's a little harder to get in here unless you know exactly where it's at. As you probably have read from the other reviews, it's right across the street from Super G Mart and adjacent to the gas station and the ABC store.   Anyways onto the food. We got the 50 wing platter (which was a ton!) and drenched the sauce of teriyaki garlic sauce and the whooli's sauce. My table purely enjoyed the Whooli's sauce over the teriyaki sauce because it was a little too salty. But, if you want to try out both and determine it yourself I say go 50/50!  Other dishes we ordered here were the Potato Skins, Nachos, and the Roast Beef Sandwich. The sandwich was sort of massive if you asked me. Stacked up to 4 layers, it will definitely fill you up. The Potato Skins and the Nachos were appetizers and they also filled you up quickly.  My table definitely did not finish our meal and ended up packing it up to go into the fridge for a quick midnight snack.  Overall, I loved the service and the ambiance. It was a easy bar (with not so many beer selections) and it had a couple of pool tables. When we went there was even a league playing so we got a chance to watch some playing, which I thought was entertaining. Come and have some wings and come out filled and happy!",

    "text": "Walking into a dive bar never fails to take me back to my college days of getting carded at the bar and beer-pong tournaments under the umbrellas out back.  This place fits that feeling like a glove.  It's trying to be a sports bar, and is overwhelmingly local, complete with bowling trophies, little league sponsorships, and bar stool occupants who haven't moved since the internet was born.  The Reuben I had, which was recommended by the gal running the front of the house, was good, it wasn't as great as she hyped it up to be.  There was another local stopping by and picking up some wings to go, which looking back after reading my fellow yelpers, I regret not ordering.    Don't expect much and this place could pleasantly surprise you.",
