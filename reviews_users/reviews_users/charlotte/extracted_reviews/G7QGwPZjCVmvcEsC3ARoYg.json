My daughter said their burger is as good as (\"better\") than mine. Although slightly offended, I have to admit she's almost right. They were playing Wayne's World and a Harry Potter movie behind the bar tonight which is perfect. The old wood behind the bar and a perfect old fashioned make this place high on my list for when I'm in Charlotte. It's your neighborhood bar exactly as your mind sees it. My daughter, who \"doesn't like to eat at a bar\", was very impressed. 'Nuff said.",

I ordered the pork belly sliders and it was terrible. The pork belly was very chewy and leathery. I , literally, couldn't eat it...I couldn't chew it enough to even swallow it!  I told the server and he told the the owner/manager(?) and he came over as well. He told us that he wasn't surprised because he wasn't happy with the recipe either.  However, knowing that he was putting out a bad dish wasn't enough to realize that it would have been good business to offer me another menu item or not charge me for it. I had taken one bite of one slider and I attempted to cut (saw?) into the other. I didn't even eat the waffle fries because I was so turned off by the pork, but I was still charged full price. How can a restaurateur allow someone to walk out the door being completely dis-satisfied without trying to make it right? ESPECIALLY when they openly admit that it's not a good dish?!?  Unbelievable!",

    "text": "The fella and I walked over after some drinks at Carolina Beer Temple after seeing how great the Yelp reviews were. While it was pretty obvious where to enter, once we walked in, it wasn't clear how you were seated - no host stand, no sign telling you to seat yourself or wait - and there was a massive table full of people right inside the entrance. Awkward. We sat at the bar more to avoid confusion of asking where to sit. The bar itself went straight down without a cut in, so you couldn't put your legs underneath the counter, which meant you sat back pretty far - uncomfortable.  The bartender was nice, but there was no beer/wine/cocktail list. She read off the taps (which were right in front of us), told us we could see their liquor on the shelves, and said she could make any drink we wanted. The fella just went with a house white, and I got water.  For dinner, we got the Brussels sprouts, sirloin kebabs, and fried chicken bites. The sprouts were the highlight! They were tender with bacon a little tang from the brown sugar glaze. The sirloin kebabs were fine, but there wasn't much taste - you definitely needed the chimichurri sauce or ginger soy sauce to give them some oomph. Same with the fried chicken bites - the chicken was really tender but totally bland... thank goodness for the bacon jam!  Overall, if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.",

My only complaint: The fancy drinks on the menu are a little pricey for the location not being in the city.

My boyfriend got a version of a mule and he enjoyed it. I tried with a simple cosmo. Not to say I'm a professional drinker. But I have NO idea what they made it with. I drank it but it was weird. Asking for tequila shots ... after the 3rd try they finally had a tequila we asked for.   I'm going to say this place would be good for my regular vodka rocks straight up w lime. The place was small but cute. The workers were friendly. Can't complain there.",

I really enjoyed their crab fritters, the ratio of crab to fritter made it feel more like a crab cake. I'll probably go back just for those.   My boyfriend preferred the sliders and mac 'n' cheese, which I thought were just okay. The bartender also made him a delicious Moscow mule. They don't have a drink menu, but will make just about anything you ask for.   I'll likely go back soon and would've given 5 stars if \"one of the owners\" wasn't drinking and getting a little rowdy with some patrons at the end of the bar closest to us... Other than that group, it was a pretty chill little spot that I hope does well in this location!",

The food menu has some very interesting things on it, so after reading it I was ready to try some! We started with \"The Return of the Mac\" it was delicious! I'm a huge fan of pepper jack and a lot of the entrees have pepper jack so I was happy! We then ordered the sirloin kabobs and the pepper jack grit cakes. Both were perfect! The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff are awesome about making sure you are taken care of. I like that they show black and white movies behind the bar. It felt less like a sports bar. With all that being said, you get what you pay for. I was happy as was my date. I can only speak for myself but I see a return in the near future.",

The Brussels are perfectly cooked and apple with bacon omg genius. The burger with goat cheese and Noda BBQ sauce will have you craving this bar. Bar tenders are awesome, funny and let you pick a movie if you're nice. Try it out!",

They have a good liquor selection which enables them to make a wide range of drinks.  Worth a try.",

    "text": "We happened upon this place because the husband heard about it and he decided to check it out.  If you know me, you gotta know I'm a sucker for a good sprout. Brussels, that is. I pretty much have to try them if I go to a place and they're on the menu. I saw some on the plate of another patron and it totally solidified my choice. Turns out, they caramelize them in this brown sugar glaze, put some bacon in there and the kicker is diced granny smith apples! I've never had sprouts with fruit in them, but it was an incredibly welcome surprise. The grit cakes were good, but I had to split the portion in half. After about 2 1/2, if you're the only one eating them, it's a LOT of grits. They toasted up great in the office toaster oven for breakfast, though! lol  The husband got the Corner Bar burger and it was solid, but my favorite part of his meal was the fries. I often frequent the Chick-Fil-A because they're one of the few places that can get a good waffle fry done, but these were just as good as those. And they have a bourbon honey mustard that will knock your socks all the way off.   I was very pleased with my drink selections. I got one of their specials with a tasty bourbon and the martini with espresso in it since I was sleepy. Hashtag old. The husband just got some Coppers and that was it.  So, overall: the bartenders were both very nice. As soon as we sat at the bar, we were promptly greeted. They offered suggestions when we told them we were first timers. We had some fun chitchat, which is always a good time if you're sitting at a bar. If you bring a pooch, you gotta keep them outside. The restrooms were clean and fully stocked. The sanitation score was up to par. The bartender that picked the movies while we were there has awesome taste (Ocean's Eleven in black and white). We had a great time and we'll definitely be returning! I wish Ayrsley was this cool when we lived closer to it.",

If you are tired of the Piedmont Social House scene like I am, definitely stop on over here for a unique experience. Honestly, I don't see how anyone can go wrong. Great drinks, great food. Dude.. Just make your way over here and stop playing corn hole or whatever that is called.   I actually really enjoy that they don't have a drink menu. It forces conversation with the extremely knowledgeable bartenders for one and two.. You may end up trying something you never knew you loved. (Perk for me, they now have Riesling here)   Despite not having a drink menu, they do have a small food menu. So far I have only had the Lettuce Wraps (which were actually really good) so I can't speak too extensively on the food but a fellow neighboring bar mate eased any apprehensions by letting me know that majority of the items are pretty good. After browsing some of the reviews, I think many would agree. Never had lettuce wraps that were beef but it was a really good!   Side note: you know that this place is golden when they have a \"regular\" who visits often and doesn't even live locally! Come sit at the bar and I am sure one other person sitting there too is a regular.   Pro Tip: Make sure you get Zane as your bartender.",

The service was impeccable and the care they put into ensuring everything was great couldn't have been better. The food was really good. We had a cheese board (big hit), the fried chicken bites (my favorite), pork belly tacos (their pork belly was good), lettuce wraps, and the waffle fries. No one had anything bad to say about the food and pretty sure it was all gone in the end.   Drinks were a big hit with my Co-workers. A lot of it tends to be whiskey/bourbon based and they are into that. I'm not so much, but the bar is fully stocked and they will attempt to make whatever want!   The biggest thing for me that put them over the top to 5 stars was the service. As the organizer everything was made easy for me and that's super important. They rolled with a couple of quirks and never once lost their friendly vibe. The manager especially blew me away with his level of customer service and willingness to jump in and do EVERYTHING!! Highly recommend not only for an event but for a casual night out!",

Then the Chicken and Grits came out. This is a favorite among the staff and I can totally see why. The salsa is awesome and perfectly sweet. The dish was well balanced with the sharp flavors of the Grits cakes. And the chicken was tender and properly charged.   We'll only be here for a week but I'm already planning a 3rd trip!

    "text": "This is exactly the type of bar that Charlotte needs.   The Corner Bar is -- you guessed it -- in the corner unit with Title Boxing, adjacent to Ayrsley Grand Cinema. It's a small space, but the decor and layout keep it from feeling cramped. Two televisions above the bar play black and white movies; on my last visit they were screening White Heat. If there's a game on you absolutely must see, they'll switch it over for you, but the movies create a warm, nostalgic atmosphere that's tough to beat. The music is enjoyable, too; I heard some Beatles, Stones, and Zeppelin on my visit.  I've visited for dinner and was very pleased with my choices of Sirloin Kabobs and Caramelized Brussels Sprouts. The chimichurri sauce on the kabobs adds a delightful flavor, and the sirloin is cooked perfectly. The Brussels sprouts are easily the best I've had dining out; the bacon and granny smith apples make the dish shine. Portions are great for passing along your party, but one or two small plates make a decent meal if you, like me, aren't into sharing.  I can't speak for the drinks, as I just had club soda with lime, but I can say that the bartenders seem to operate exceptionally well together and enjoy their work. They call everyone by name and make sure that everyone is comfortable and ready to relax and have a nice night out.   All in all, The Corner Bar seems like a nice neighborhood hangout that's happy to welcome locals, travelers, and people looking to try something new.",

    "text": "Visited the Corner Bar on a stop over night in Charlotte on the way to the beach. Fun little place with a trendy vibe. Small menu, but carefully thought out and good for sharing over drinks. We had sirloin kabobs with an amazing chimichuri sauce, waffle fries, and pepper jack deep fried grit cakes. I am a girl who loves grits- they found a way to add pepper jack cheese to them and deep fry those suckers and serve them with some sort of delicious sauce I couldn't identify and I was in love!   Only downside was service was a bit slow because only the bartender was taking care of the whole place. They needed more help in there on a Friday at 5:30. She was friendly and worked hard, though.",

I regret to say that I ordered most of the menu Togo to give a feel for the new neighborhood watering hole and felt it was more of a inconvenience to Oder Togo than dine in.   I ended up getting my food, shoved in a empty case of beer since the Togo containers were so small and they didn't have Togo bags.   The food was ok, most burnt and not having adequate sized Togo boxes i ended up getting every menu item deconstructed very annoying   I also regret to say that they don't have a cocktail menu. they also don't use fresh ingredients for juices so they have all preservatives in there cocktails. They have really made there image a dive bar instead of higher end for our neighborhood and the local hotel next door.   This place could be something great, but it's becoming a letdown   The lady waiting on me seemed nice. And slightly knowledgeable but needs more training.  The rest of the bartenders seemed nice but getting the vibe they need more training as well.   Also...  You don't leave vermouth sitting out in the well, it's refrigerated. And Walmart vermouth with $15 bourbon don't make nice manhattans.",

I received great service, and the drinks were fine and it seemed like a date night destination with some more casual diners at the bar.   Unfortunately, we all left feeling a little \"meh\" about the food. We personally ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Bites,  side of waffle fries and Pork Belly sandwich and at the table was Fried Crab Fritters, Charcuterie Board, Seared Ahi Tuna Salad that we tried from our friends.  We had a good spread of different things on the menu.   My favorite thing was the Pork Belly Sandwich because I love my pork belly nice and fatty and juicy and tender which is what we received. But the majority said that it was TOO fatty (which may be absurd to me, but worth mentioning to you). My least favorite thing was the Fried Chicken Bites, just seemed a little over cooked to where the chicken was dry, we did not finish that entree and did not want to cause any trouble of sending it back.   Overall, everyone ate their food but no one was in love with it and my guests would probably not return. If we come back it will definitely to do drinks because the service was great.",

First off Alan, the manager, was THE BEST....so welcoming, friendly, attentive (but not smothering) and mostly a really good sport as we all had questions and were looking for suggestions etc...  The staff was super and hard working. Never too busy to get you something you needed.  We loved the vibe and everyone there at the other tables seemed to be having fun. Good energy.  So many yummy plates of food going by and we all ordered something different and shared. LOVED the Brussels Sprouts. Mac & Cheese- YES! As for the drinks----lots of creative choices and all VERY GOOD. They actually put alcohol in them! Beer options were great too. Something for everyone.  We will come back for dinner soon as those steaks and burgers looked so tempting!",

It has become one of my favorite my go to places for happy hour or girls night out! Great beer, great service, and great food, along with outdoor seating, clean bathrooms, black & white movies, and a super chill vibe. Alan is the best! He always goes above and beyond. The food I had tonight was to die for...boneless fried chicken pieces with bacon jelly served on top of country gravy. Absolutely amazing! My friend ordered the Brussel sprouts and LOVED them (personally I wasn't a huge fan, but to be fair I hate brussel sprouts). On an awesome scale of 1-10, this place is easily a 10.

Prepared very well and the bartender definitely knew how to make it well.   Also decided to order the Sirloin Kabobs which I wish they came out with more qty wise because they were cooked extremely well. Literally ended up ordering another one and I was still hungry so ordered the Classic Burger. (I was being a  that night )  If you're in the Ballantyne area, definitely check out this spot. Very cool spot for a group and the GM was very helpful in finding something that was good for Vegans (lettuce wrap). Would be nice if they would incorporate more vegan/gluten friendly since my friend had a hard thing finding something.  Side note and nothing to do with the service/food just a weird conversation:  A friend ordered the Classic Burger & the GM named the types of cheeses they had in stock and stated Provolone is the closest to America Cheese? WTH? Never heard that before but anyway moving ijs.",

I think the burger could have been even better, but we asked for it medium rare and it came medium well. The toppings on it were great. The chicken was a little dry, but the sauce and toppings were good.   We also got the Cinnamon Sugar pretzels for dessert which I really liked. They came with a cream cheese frosting that was amazing.   A couple of other things I sampled that were good that others ordered: the Bacon Gouda Fries and the Brussels Sprouts.   Overall, this is nice bar with elevated bar food.",

We couldn't decide on just one thing so we went topas style and tried 3 plates. The Gouda waffle fries were  covered in creamy Gouda cheese with small pieces of bacon..yum! Crab fritters and chicken bites were also great! Can't wait to try everything else. Saw a burger being served and it looked really good.  The servers, Kami and Alan were very personable and attentive. Alan brewed a new batch of tea just for me! I'm the weirdo asking for sweet tea in a bar. We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere and will definitely go back.. Seemed like a spot locals like to hang out and I see why.   Definitely go when you are hungry so you can try severel plates. Five star food at bar prices!",

This could easily be my \"Cheers\" if I lived in Ayrsley. Why? Because sometimes you just want to go where everybody knows your name! Lol.  Every time I have gone they usually have the same bartenders and they're always extremely friendly. The menu is small but the food is amazing. I wouldn't necessarily classified as a tapas restaurant but that's really what it is. A lot of different small to medium plaits that don't really go together but you can try a few things can be happy.  They also carry many local beers and the cocktails are are awesome. I love a great mule and there's is fantastic!  This time around my wife and I both tried something new. We tried to the beef lettuce wraps. We were both in for a surprise when they came to the table because you have to wrap them yourself. After the initial shock of that it was love at first bite. It was so well seasoned! I have to say this is probably my first time having beef lettuce wraps but I will certainly have them again.  Standouts: Their loaded cheese fries Their popcorn chicken Their burger Their Moscow mule",

The Corner Bar is a quaint little spot with character and friendly staff. For such a small place, the menu provides a good variety of drink choices and small (to medium) bites.   I had the crab fritters and a sampling of the brussel sprouts. The fritters were okay. They were a little too cakey for my taste. From many reviews, I expected more crab or at least most of a crab flavor. The brussel sprouts were better than the fritters and seem to be a favorite, as I noticed many orders leaving the kitchen. The bacon jam provides an interesting flavor.   I would visit again for the atmosphere. It is a great place for business meetings or just winding down after work. It's a great location with indoor and outdoor seating.",

It's a quaint little bar but a great spot to grab a drink and some dinner, they have two large TVs, and even offer trivia on certain nights. I was alone so I sat at the bar, but there were plenty of large tables and groups gathered.  Service was great, the bartender promptly handed me a drink menu and took my order as soon as I sat down. I went with one of their signature cocktails, a Gin Wilder. They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol, this was plenty strong and refreshing (and it should be for $12). To eat I went with the Peach-Glazed Chicken and Grits. I was pleasantly surprised that the chicken was grilled, which is nice because I'm trying to make healthier eating choices. It was very tasty, though I felt like it was lacking some flavor and the portion size was smaller than I was expecting.  I don't think I would come back unless I was staying in the Ayrsley area, but if you are- definitely check this place out.",

It was crowded and was noisy. The food menu was limited, but we gave it a shot. I had the peach glazed chicken. It came with grits that were somehow embedded in thick pieces of toast. Really decadent.  And, though I rarely drink alcohol, I had a vodka drink with muddled strawberries and lime and jalapenos.  It was spicy and the different flavors worked so well together. I shouldn't have gotten the second one, but I did.  The first drink ALWAYS tastes the best!  As we left, we both said that we wish there were a CORNER BAR in our neck of the woods.  This is exactly what the Blakeney area is missing.  Oh, the service was friendly and great. One final observation:  this could be the site of a new sitcom, kind of like CHEERS.  It's got a personality.  If you haven't been, go check it out. What's not to like about a Corner Bar?",

The pork belly was overcooked and tough but the arugula and onions were yummy and fresh. The Gouda fries were why we originally came here! They were ok and surprisingly needed to be salted.   Despite a mediocre experience food-wise, I think we would still come back here. Like I said, the vibe and service are great. But this would not be my first recommendation for food in Arsley.",

The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is very relaxed and the music isn't blaring in your ear. The food is decent but nothing to write home about. The place has the feel of a craft cocktail style bar but the drinks are far from it. They have the liquors to produce good quality drinks but that's not going to happen with fake juices and a bartender that doesn't know what angostura bitters are.",
