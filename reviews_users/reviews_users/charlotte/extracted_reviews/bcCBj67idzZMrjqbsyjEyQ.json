    "text": "First impressions are everything and Dot Dot Dot fell WAY short of making a good one. To begin, this is far from a speakeasy. It's a restaurant; a very loud, overpriced restaurant, with \"house rules\" that are not being followed. I used to live in DC and this was nothing like my experiences with speakeasies up there. I would say The Cellar in uptown is a far better option for the price and quality of drinks. Plus, The Cellar actually has real history.   Dot Dot Dot served decent drinks (they were inventive but mine seemed water downed lowering its rating). Ordered the charcuterie which was far from creative. It was an underwhelming few bits of crostini and cheese, not worth the price. Ambiance wasn't there at all, as it was just as loud as a sports bar. The waitress could barely hear our orders and having a conversation with the couple we were with required a great deal of repeating ourselves.  Nothing about this place spoke class and eloquence of a speakeasy other than the \"leather\" books on the book shelves.  Finally, this is petty, but two unisex bathrooms, one toilet in each? Come on. Just makes for a terrible experience as well. Such a pet peeve of mine, particularly when there's a booth right next to the bathrooms.  If you haven't paid for the membership yet, don't! You're wasting $10 to eat and drink mediocrity.",

    "text": "OK, so this time i wore pants and was able to get in. You wont let men in in shorts and flip flops but we saw a few ladies with shorts and flip flops and they were allowed in.  DOUBLE STANDARD.  Our son called while we were sitting at the bar and my wife answered to make sure everything was ok it took all of about 45 seconds and the owner of the place Stefan who bartends as well told her the next time take the call outside. When I think of a speakeasy i think of lounge couches over stuffed chairs in seating areas, a person playing a sax, intimate tables for 4 to 6 and a food & beverage menu that is very unique.  Well let me just say the only unique item is their cocktail menu everything else is just ordinary items that you can get at other restaurants in Charlotte.  So here is where i get a little perturbed, you had us pay for a membership for a speakeasy and all in all its a restaurant and nothing more. So we had to pay $10 to eat in your restaurant, ahhhhhh you got us but just that once. I had a drink that was smoked in a box that was outstanding, my wife had a few Moscow mules that she loved and that was the highlight of night. We had the meat and cheese board and it was good, we also had the risotto fritter and it was good.  The menu like i said is not very creative and unique. Also, you do not have desserts and you really should, most all restaurants even fast food chains have desserts.    You really need to quit calling yourself a speakeasy, just because you go in the back door and walk down a hall way that does not make you a speakeasy.  You are a restaurant.",

    "text": "Oh, Dot Dot Dot, how I wanted to love you. I had extremely high hopes for this joint considering the ownership, but it unfortunately didn't live up to the hype. For example, it is billed as a speakeasy/classy cocktail parlor, but the noise level inside is more comparable to a college bar during power hour. Additionally, the ownership and the staff apparently don't like to follow, nor enforce their own rules. Not only did the ownership and staff coddle the wannabe \"big shots\" to the left and right of me and my wife, but they also allowed them to scream the entire time. Classy...I think not.   Now, there were a few positives during our visit. My wife and I both enjoyed the cocktails and food that we chose. For instance, I had the Truffle Sour and it was spot on! We loved the Octopus with the Chorizo and Chimichurri! Also, the decor was beautifully done, and it definitely gave off an upscale vibe.   All in all, I give this establishment 2.5 stars out of 5. I do plan on giving them another chance in the future, so hopefully they are able to turn things around before then. In the meantime, I'm going to have to reminisce about my heavenly experience at both Bourbon & Branch and Wilson & Wilson out in SF.",

    "text": "This place has become a welcome staple for my husband and me - which is saying a lot considering the first time I went there I vowed to NEVER GO BACK.  I read the reviews, I did my homework, I bought the membership... My husband and I first went on a hot summer day last year.  He was wearing a button up and shorts (the same old story).  We got in, sat down, ordered our drinks, and only then did a very nice man come over and tell my husband his attire wasn't up to snuff.  Objectively, he did ask if we lived close and if he was willing to go home and change he would buy our first round of drinks (which was fortunate as they were $18/each and we weren't crazy about them).  Me, being a hot-headed woman and fiercesome defender of my loved ones was as white hot mad as if someone slapped my husband in the face.  I was ready to walk out.  My husband, on the other hand, is logical, cool-headed and just plain nice.  He wasn't put off at all.  He asked me to stay while he went home.  Blah blah blah... So, you may be thinking... where's the climax?  Why did you go back?  Well, the truth is I was angry for a while after that.  But we ordered drinks we liked and because you're not supposed to have your phone out - we ended up talking.  I mean really talking.  Because we had nothing to distract ourselves we had one of the best conversations we've had in months.  Listen, I'm not promising this is going to happen to you - but I left feeling really... good.  I felt like I had an awesome date night with my husband where we only focused on listening to each other.  It was kind of like a time warp - no phones, no television, great drinks and even better food. It was really, really nice to be forced to slow down and enjoy it.  We've been back maybe once a week since then.  The food is SUPERB.  I mean, A+++, 5 Star good.  And when we go, we are mindful of what we wear.  The \"staff\" (why does that word feel condescending?) is pretty freaking wonderful.  We've gotten to know the bartenders and the hosts - everyone is authentic and seems to genuinely like what they do.  And we've seen them deal with a lot of shit.  I get it - I was there too.  Rules are annoying... but I pulled my foot out of my ass and now I love it.  I mean, I really love it.  So . here's my advice:  Get over yourself so you can enjoy yourself.  Warning: it gets loud as hell on the weekends.  I prefer weeknights, but that's more my style.  The smokebox is their most popular. I LOVE old-fashions, but this was a bit much for me.  The NY Truffle Sour is extraordinary.  Also - the Vieux Carre (equal parts bourbon and N'awlins magic) - you're welcome.",

    "text": "I had my friends birthday party at Dot Dot Dot on Friday. I purchased a membership a few weeks before my visit. When you arrive, they scan your ID and provide you with your membership card. You walk down a long brick corridor which gives you more of a secret speakeasy feel. They serve the best drinks I've had in charlotte so far. For a good drink I used to only go to the punch room at the ritz Carlton but Dot Dot Dot is definitely strong competition. The drinks taste amazing but be careful, they are very strong. You will want to pace yourself for sure.   The food taste good but don't come hungry. The portions are small so if you're expecting to fill up, you'll need to order many items before feeling satisfied. Their small plates are full of flavor so if you just need a snack it's a nice treat.  The only area I hope improves soon is the noise level. It was next level loud. I'm not sure if it was the other guest or the music but if you're looking for quiet and intimate, make sure you go during a time/day the place is empty. Otherwise the noise level is at a 10.  I will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Ok, so here's the deal. This place is special... for Charlotte. I say that because the craft cocktail lounge has been perfected in other geos and this place still has farther to go. Good news is, their mistakes are common ones, bad news is those mistakes have more to do with the culture and mindset of management and, thus, may be hard to overcome.    There seems to be a serious disconnect between the ideology of the place set forth by the owners and talent (I.e. bar manger, mixologists) and the group the customers interface with (hosts and servers). The drinks are fancy and interesting and crafted with an aesthetic that makes you think there are experts behind the the recipes. Yet, ask the server a simple question and they know very little about what they are delivering. Ours was confused about gin versus vodka and I'm fairly certain she's never had a decent drink in her life. She was also cavalier about the swapping out of tequilas in a particular mixed drink as if they are all the same. An experienced or well trained server, even one that doesn't know bev, could have at least faked it.   Lastly, when the drinks/ food was delivered it was placed on top of my handbag which happened to be a vintage Ferragamo clutch. The bottom of the tartar plate left behind a pickled red onion which I didn't notice until it was time to go. By then, the oil and vinegar had seeped into the delicate magenta silk, leaving behind a stain. The server noticed it when I did and her reaction to it was one of, 'oh well, at least it wasn't something valuable'.   Besides the bag being very expensive ($1000+), it has sentimental value (I bought it for my engagement dinner and used it very few times since then). Look, I know s@&t happens. Lovely things get messed up when you take them out. I didn't expect anyone to fix it but, again, this shows the staffs lack of understanding of, not only what they are serving, but who they are serving it to. Most people willing to pay seventeen dollars for a cocktail are willing to pay a high price for craftsmanship.  A characteristic which likely extends beyond their glass and, if they are a woman, to their handbag.   A little training on what they are serving and who they are serving to, could go a long way here to ensure the Dot .. vision does not fall apart during execution.",

    "text": "Well, I was excited to hear that Dot Dot Dot was opening, so I had to go check it out asap. Since they don't take reservations, our group decided to head there early on this past Friday. Oh, by the way if you didn't know, this place is a private club with a membership needed to get in. I signed up online before it opened, but you can pay your $10 membership at the door before going in. Overall it was a pretty easy process to get in. The entrance is very unassuming as well, and it's in the backlot of the Park road shopping center, just look for a loading dock type area.  Once inside, we are led down a long dark corridor and the host greets us to take us through  another door and finally our table. The interior atmosphere is very classy and dark, kind of like someone's large fancy study or library that just so happens to have a bar in it. As others have mentioned, it can be a fairly boisterous space, and we noted that the volume definitely increased as more people filled in. While we needed to speak loudly, I never really felt like I was yelling or screaming. If anything, the dim lighting was more of a challenge to deal with initially, but the eyes adjusted. Now onto the menu, the drink list is extensive and I'm sure that they can make you pretty much anything with all the bottles that I saw. As a group, we tried the vesper, the hot box, negroni, the bi-plane, a Moscow mule, the final countdown and the front porch punch. All the drinks were well made, and my favorites were the negroni and Moscow mule. Some of the prices seemed marginally high, but nothing crazy and premium drinks demand a premium price. As for the food, this is the part of the experience that fell flat for me. We tried the gravlax, oysters, octopus, charcuterie, chicken skewers and beef tartar. Overall the concept seems to be small plate style. The gravlax and tartar were my favorites by far, but nothing really stood out. We received our oysters already dressed with horseradish and mignonette, as opposed to those being put on the side. The oysters were also a little warm, which may have been from the warm mignonette, I'm not sure. Either way, they were fine. Having all said that, the service is the last matter to cover. Overall, service was very good with some hiccups, such as twice food presented to us that was for another table and once when our food was presented to another table but ultimately made it to us. Also, they need a whisky/spirit list, as they apparently have an extensive list. And one last thing would be to explain the components of the charcuterie plate, which cheeses and meats are on the plate. I don't think that they were noted on the menu or by the server when the plate was put on the table.   I know that this is a long review, but I really like the concept of Dot Dot Dot, so I want them to do well. At this point, I would be more inclined to stop in for drinks and maybe a snack as opposed to a full meal. I will definitely return and look forward to sitting at the bar and seeing the bartenders work.",

So we went across the street to get a drink in.  Literally 3 mins in we get a call/text saying there ready for us.  REALLY? You told us 20/30 mins.  We texted we be there in 15 mins.  A woman called literally after we texted l, (rudely) asking were we are at and that theres people waiting for a a table.  1st of all dont tell us its a 20/30 min wait when its 5 min.  And dont get mad when we arrive  20/30 min at expected time we were told.  Server was great thats all.  This place is so loud you might as well go to a regular bar.  We didnt order food because thatz not the main focus of a  speakeasy. \" we  shouldnt be asked or given a food menu before their beloved cocktail menu.  That right there told us this was a restaurant more than a cocktail bar.  Long story short.  No secrecy, Bad Customer Service/customer service, WAY TOO LOUD,  Dress code not enforced.  You basically pay a membership to eat there and not to enter a EXCLUSIVE CLUB to drink their unique cocktails they have to offer from a speak easy mindfield.  Not returning at all.  Good Luck",

I've been working my way through the menu and my favorites are a tie between the Sidecar and the Hotbox...which could not be more different from each other. The oysters on the half shell come with the toppings already on them, making them the easiest to eat I've ever been served. I would not recommend that you come starving as it's really not a restaurant, but the small plates are great to munch on.   I personally love the concept of one-in-one-out; I'd rather wait than be jostled around in a crowd and have to elbow through people to get a drink. The dress code requires a bit of advance planning, but overall is not difficult to meet. I know I can't wait to go back - I'll be here whenever we have the funds for a nicer date night or have a friend in town I want to impress. Cheers to the owners for doing something different in Charlotte.",

There are plenty to chose from... I know there is at least 1 on the list that will fit what you like. If your not sure, tell the server or bartender what you like and they will make one to suit you.

    "text": "I've been waiting to see Stefan (most recently over at Heist) behind his new speakeasy bar for a while now and I'm so glad my husband and I got to go on their second official night.  We previously signed up for the 10.00 membership since it's considered a private club. You can do it online but then must receive a confirmation email that your payment went through. We got to the door, gave them our name and bam...card in hand. You are greeted at the end of a dimly lot hallway and seated inside at a table or the bar but there can be a wait for the bar. That is where we would have preferred to sit but it was already busy at 6:30 when we ended up arriving. We could have waited at a small stand up area but didn't see that until we had already been seated at a table.  We ordered these drinks in no particular order; The hot box, the truffle New York sour, modern royalty and the biplane. The hot box is a cocktail that comes in a Bookers box with woodchips that are smoking so it makes the whole place smelled really good. My favorite was the truffle New York sour where the eggs are infused with truffle so you really get that nice earthy note to the drink. We did end up getting a snack which was the octopus and sometimes that can be tough but they did a great job keeping it tender. The menu looked delicious from top to bottom.  The inside is beautiful, it looks like an old school library/lounge and the copper punched tin tiles on the ceiling are great touch. This was a great date night and we look forward to coming back and sitting at the bar",

I switched out Elijah Craig for red breast.. equivalent liquors and my drink was $27 dollars before tax. An entire bottle of red breast is $71 so I've paid for over 1/3 the bottle. Cocktail bars are suppose to know about cocktail and liquors not over charge for Ignorance. Won't be back. The drink was an old fashion so nothing that takes specialized knowledge per the owners rude comment below regarding a \"cocktail\" with 1.5 ounces per drink = $432 ($675 with 1oz pours) in his pocket off of one $71 bottle of liquor. Do the math big guy - you're arrogant and rip people off. You can get the same drink at Seoul food meat company for $18 and workman's friend for about $20. I suggest going to these places! Better food and better service without a steep price.  He even admits below Elijah Craig is only $29 - cheap liquor are the go to's on the menu. Pathetic for such an \"upscale\" place.",

This obscure place is interesting......the membership is 10$......I'm not sure why but I guess they demand exclusivity, class, proper etiquette. When we got there a lit woman at the door was quizzing everyone about the Black Panthers....and I don't mean the movie recently released.   The place had a strong odor of smoked salmon.... must be those \"hot boxes.\"  Drinks were good, the vibe was good. We didn't get appetizers but they looked decent. Best cherries in my drink.   I looked up the definition of mixologist as I wanted to understand why my drinks were exceptionally expensive.  Basically you don't need a degree but you apparently learn to mix drinks, talk to customers and smile. Right.....nothing like Tom Cruise/Cocktail...... I'm sure the millenials will like that enough to justify their self esteem boosting baller lifestyle.   So, based on other reviews about  the magical effect this place has on relationships, oddly enough,  I broke up with my boyfriend after an hour and 4 years......   ok. just kidding about the relationship..... we will go back. We did buy the membership.",

I would give four and a half stars for the loud atmosphere because it's a bit hard to hear your friends over the noise, and they need to work on acoustics. I had the Truffle New York sour drink and it was excellent and the flavor was amazing!! The other people in my group tried the No Last Call, Thai Basil Smash and Old Fashioned drinks. We liked all of them. The Truffle NY sour was the favorite. The reservation process was a bit long, loud atmosphere and wait time was a factor but you cannot give half stars on yelp. Overall I would visit again and try more drinks! Love the library decorations too!  Prices average about 13-14 dollars per drink.

    "text": "My husband and I were vacationing in Charlotte for only 2 days and decided to make Dot Dot Dot one of our stops. We purchased the membership prior to our trip since we had read it's best to have it ahead of time.   It was a Sunday night so we expected it wouldn't be crowded. We arrived around 8:30 for dinner and were told we had the choice between the bar or a table. The hostess recommended the bar, so we took that option. The bar is beautiful and the bartenders are mixing up some very fancy drinks, which can be fun to watch, so I could tell immediately why she had made this recommendation.   Here are the highs and lows of my experience:  Highs:  -Loved the cocktails.  It's their specialty. They put a lot of thought and effort into it and it shows. Our bartenders \"Andrew\" & \"Andrew\" haha...were both great. They were personable and made some great recommendations for our short stay in Charlotte. Please note we did not come here looking for happy hour specials or cheap drinks, we knew going in the price on these drinks was a bit higher and were OK with that for the quality.  -We shared the crab cake, poke, pate', wagyu steak and pasta w/ peas.  The food was incredible. The only dish that didn't wow me was the crab cake. It was a bit dry. I wanted to order seconds on everything else though. I was incredibly impressed with the food overall.  Lows:  -The crowd was not what I expected. It was a Sunday night in a members only cocktail lounge that prides itself on being \"classy\" but this crowd was, not that. To my right was a group of 4 incredibly loud and drunk people with no regard for the people around them. They were making so much noise we couldn't even hold a conversation. Once they left, the entire experience improved dramatically.  -I'm a dessert person and was disappointed to find out there are no dessert options. Even if they offered one dessert option and made it liquor infused and stuck to their theme, I think that could make a good addition to the menu.  -We were ready to order another food item around 9:45 and were told the kitchen might be closed. We had thought the restaurant was open until 2AM (didn't realize there was a change to their hours recently) and while they accommodated and put the food order in for us, it would be nice to get a \"last call\" type of offer at some point so we would've known we were cutting it close on ordering.   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and plan to return even if only while vacationing. :)",

    "text": "Ohhhhhhhh Dot Dot Dot.  I am in love.  I'm SO in love.  My experience was truly amazing.  I signed up for their membership (which is ten dollars) with the plan to go that same night.  I made sure I saved my email confirmation as I wasn't sure if it took a while to get approved or what.  So I was prepared......  My Hubs and I showed up around 9:00 and there was a small gathering outside.  When we walked up, the gentleman checking people in simply asked me if I had a membership and I said yes.  He asked me what my last and first name was and I told him.  I told him that I just signed up this morning so I have my confirmation if you can't find my name.  He cut me off when I was saying this and said \"well you're in luck because I already found you\" and slipped me my little black membership card.  They were having issues with those who signed up that day and couldn't find names BUT THEY HAD MINE!  wahoo! score! They would have let you in as long as you had your email confirmation...so don't delete that until you get a card the first time. The couple in front of me kept swearing they signed up but she didn't have her email confirmation in her inbox or couldn't find the charge in her bank account...so she left (not happy).  But not their fault....so keep the email.  (and don't forget to push \"submit\" when purchasing a membership..lol.  That's what I think happened...  Anyway (that was a long intro ...sorry).  They put our name down, and said it would be about an hour wait.  No problem.  I didn't care! I was just excited to be going in!  So they said that they would text me as soon as my table was ready.  We walked over to Amelie's (so perfect) for a glass of wine and as soon as we sat down and I had like literally two sips...I got a text saying my table was ready.  HAHAHA! We slammed back the wine and trotted over to Dot Dot Dot.  The cool part and what made me feel taken care of was as soon as I got to a few steps away from the bottom of the steps, the gentleman he came down to meet us half way and escorted us to the door.  So nice of him!    Once inside, you walk down this long narrow, cool brick hallway to the Hostess stand.  sooooooo dark and creepy and cool.  lol! It's got lights lining either side of the walls so you can see.  Such a cool vibe.  You really do feel like you're entering into a True \"speak easy\" and it's extremely private.  Hard to explain into words.  but I think they captured the essences of what a Speakeasy was back in the day.  The host confirmed if I was Meyer, and opened the door and I walked into a vibrant room full of people.  big tables....small tables, people chatting away.  The decor was awesome!  Host took us to our table and I was just in aww.  We didn't try the food as we already ate, but had two of their cocktails. Delicious.   A couple of tips: If you're a dude...don't wear shorts and sneakers.  I heard that they are strict with dress code.  No that doesn't mean you can wear DRESS shorts or Khaki shorts.  C'mon dudes...if you have a lady on your arm or WANT a lady on your arm...I'm sure she's wearing heels and has an outfit on that will stop anyone in their tracks.  So shorts and flip flops and socks ain't gonna cut it.  So go dressed like the Mr. GQ you are (or hope to be).  Don't be in a hurry and be patient with getting inside.  Go grab a drink elsewhere if the wait is long and just come back when they text.  No biggie!  I can't WAIT to go back.  The Back Lot at the park road shopping center is becoming a really cool place to be!!",

    "text": "I am glad that they have attempted to bring an authentic speakeasy to Charlotte. I enjoy the fact that they have a membership process (which is very reasonable), the house rules seemed adequate, and everything up to the door service and location seemed to fit what comes to my mind when I envision \"speakeasy.\"  Inside of Dot dot dot, was where I had a slight disappointment however. There was a speakeasy aesthetic, but not a speakeasy ambience. People for one certainly were not speaking easy, it was loud and a tad obnoxious. Usually this would be controlled, especially given the house rules, but I will say that it is still early in their tenure and they probably did not want to upset anyone by asking them to be quiet.   The drinks were redeeming, their bar staff are great and have a good array of drinks with simple elegant twists.  For me a speakeasy is more about the ambience, and in this regard I think there is still more to work on at dot dot dot. I will definitely be returning, and if nothing else look forward to another good drink.",

We were seated at the bar and had great service. There is a nice selection of cocktails. What we really enjoyed is the atmosphere. This is a place nestled into the back of a strip mall reminiscent of speakeasies in NYC or my hometown of Miami. Inside, there are small tables and the bar is illuminated from behind the bartenders and there is soft lighting throughout. It wasn't too loud and it just felt like a place to linger.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I never made it in the front door. I, in fact, was turned away from the front door by the \"bouncer\" or doorman or whoever he was. This individual walked towards me and suggested that I \"run home to change into pants and come back\" as their dress code would not allow my shorts to enter. It is really a shame. I was excited to check this place out. I paid for the $10 membership online and had planned to meetup with 5 other of my associates/coworkers there for a good time. It was actually fun because we struggled a bit to find the the door to get in the place ... just as a speak-easy should be! But folks ... let's face it! This is CHARLOTTE! We live in the south. We dress casual! Especially during the summer. The funny thing to me is I would have been perfectly acceptably dressed for Kiawah Island where we are truly \"private members.\"  My outfit was a polo shirt tucked and belted navy shorts. So, I'm going to call it right here. If they don't change their overly obnoxious list of rules on their website, they simply will not last in Charlotte. That is my prediction. Butter tried this ... dress code ... and well, they didn't exactly hang around long. As a new business, they lost out on 6 customers last night. Our tab at Packhouse was well over $200 ... and we were graciously invited in and ended up enjoying the cool weather out on their front porch.",

I personally love the fact that there is a dress code and limited standing room, it makes it different than the hundreds of other places in town - I also didn't notice it being overly loud when I was there.  I got to sit at the bar and chat with Stefan the first time I came and he really is a personable guy.  My friend was going to Chicago on a work trip and he gave her excellent recommendations of bars to try.  The Negroni was excellent and I think I will get the Steak Tar Tar every time I go!

    "text": "Came here on a Wednesday, paid the membership fee in advance, checked in and was told to about an hour for two of us. No big deal, went to Midwood and had drinks until we got a notification text. Upon entering we were led to a table...a two top that happened to be right next to where the bathrooms were behind the two large booths. This is such a pet peeve of mine, why do I want to wait an hour to be seated next to the bathroom entrance?!  At one point, we literally had random people standing/hovering around our table in line for the bathroom. Our waitress was either checked out or just exhausted from who knows what, she forgot she took our drink and food orders and then came back to retake them. Our food items came out waaaaaaaay before our drinks, even though we ordered the drinks about 10-15 min before the food. The arancini were good, as well as the skewers. 4 pieces of tiny crostini for a large meat and cheese board is NEVER ENOUGH. The first drink I got was filled to the brim and the waitress spilled about a third of it when setting it down, muttered \"sorry\" and walked away. I got the hot box as my second drink and the waitress opened it like 0.5 inches from my face. I have a thick beard, now my beard smells like burning wood chips and has for a few days even after washing it. At the end of the day this place is a glorified restaurant that is underground and has a hidden entrance, it's super loud, and didn't remind me a speak easy at all",

    "text": "I don't often write a review after a single visit but I was so charmed by Dot Dot Dot and there is such a curious mix of reviews that I had to throw my five stars into the mix.  We got there a bit after 8 on a Saturday night and had to wait about 45 minutes to get in. No problem, I anticipated this based on other reviews so we went to a nearby bar (when you're in Park Road it's easy to have multiple stops) until we got a text that they were ready for us. The hostess recommended we sit at the bar for our first visit so that we could watch them create the cocktails and be part of the action. I'm so glad we did because everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and welcoming. You can tell they really want to create an atmosphere where you want to become a regular. Everyone introduces themselves and asks for your name and asks about your experience. Multiple different people will check on you, including the owner who works behind the bar himself. I really cannot commend them enough on establishing such great rapport with their patrons.  Now, onto the drinks. DAMN. You can get a good cocktail at a few different places in Queen City but this was really remarkable. I started with a bourbon drink with some honey and citrus which was delicious. My second drink was the kicker, though. Rum with grilled pineapple blended in and freshly shaved nutmeg on top. My jaw legitimately dropped after the first sip and the owner cracked up because he watched me lose my mind over it. It was simply delectable.   As for atmosphere - it's refreshing not to have any screens or distractions. It's decorated simply with class. It does get loud but only because everyone is chatting; the music is kept pretty low. I definitely saw a few men in blue jeans that I'm not positive fit the dress code, so it's hard to say how that plays out when someone doesn't fully \"comply.\" It is definitely a place to kick back and enjoy yourself - not to get plastered and rowdy.   I hope they stick around for a long time and develop a strong identity within the Charlotte cocktail/bar community. I look forward to returning!",

    "text": "A friend of mine has been telling me to go here for a few months as he has become a \"regular.\" And despite the $12-18 cocktails, I now I know why.   First of all, it's not the easiest place to find, even if you ARE familiar with Park Road's Backlot (as a native Charlottean, and never having had a reason to go to the Backlot, I adore this. See also: Amelie's, Midwood Smokehouse). Anyway, it's tucked away without the name advertising it's whereabouts, just their logo. I say this all as a good thing. It has this \"well known secret speakeasy\" feel to it. If this is what they were intending, they nailed it. The second I walked in, my thought was \"wow I feel like we are in Manhattan!\" Mostly dim lit, smallish and intimate tables, spanning to larger tables with better lighting. A beautiful bar. A bookcase spanning a wall, and lots of exposed brick. They nailed it.  Second of all, I was very under dressed. I joined above friend and another guy as a last minute decision and I was wearing running shoes, leggings, and a fleece jacket. Fortunately on a Thursday night at 11pm it went unnoticed as it was not super crowded. The website does make it quite clear that this is not a sports bar, and there are certain expectations (wearing my bright pink Brooks and blue fleece not on their list) of the guests to ensure a classy AF environment. I'm fine with that. We need places like that.   Third of all, their cocktail menu is on point. The owner/mixologist takes a lot of pride in this, and it's obvious. Between the three of us, we had two rounds and 4 different cocktails and they were each delicious. We had a total of 3 Old Fashions (round 2 pour was much stronger than round 1), a Penicillin, a Hildago and a Strawberry Fizz. Like I said- all delicious. We did wait a bit for the drinks, but they are handcrafted and they don't cut corners. Worth it.   I will be back again soon for another cocktail, a gander at their extensive bourbon menu, and possibly even some food. This is a phenomenal place and it should be on your bucket list soon.",

There were some hiccups in the online order processing that were resolved quickly enough. We were able to get seated right away (we went around 6pm on a Saturday).   It's beautifully decorated, with a tin roof and a lot of charming retro details. The music was era-appropriate and not too loud. It's really nice to go into a bar and not have blaring TVs everywhere around you. As for the noise itself, yes, it's a bit loud, as other posters have mentioned. I'm not sure how avoidable this is in a crowded bar, though.   Our waitress was extremely helpful. She came by frequently to check on us and always made sure our waters were filled. She even brought us a complimentary cocktail when our order was taking a little longer than normal.   The drinks themselves are quite good. They are creative and blended well. Yes, they take a little bit of time because of being hand-crafted and all, but it's worth it. This is a nice bar experience, not a party place to get drunk.   All in all, I loved it here. I wish that I were a rich Charlotte banker so I could afford to come here much more frequently than I can on my editor's salary, but this will still be one of my favorite places for a classy drink. I can't wait to try the food next time!",

When we arrived we had a hard time finding it hence the term speak easy. The guy at the door introduced his self as one of the managers. Asked for our membership i didn't have a  card because this was my first time actually attending. So he was able to pull me up with my name and phone number and handed me an official black card dot dot dot membership for future visits. As he walked us in we really felt like omg where are we walking into as he is guiding us down this empty fancy looking hall to open the doors to loud music , people, drinks, and food we were wowed. Our waitress and everyone there was the best told us about any good dishes and drinks they serve and came back and fourth to our tables more than a  little to check on us since they did know it was our first time visiting. I was not that hungry at all so i just ordered the Chauterie board, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken that our waitress boasted and bragged about and surprisingly he said it was pretty darn good. The drinks we chose were pretty tasty and picture worthy as well. Very dope spot for a date night if you want to impress someone. Dot dot dot is officially high up on our list for another date night.",

The place has terrific ambiance with low but not too dimly lit lighting and a nice choice of decor. The atmosphere nicely sets up the specialty that is their drink menu.   They have mixologists that have been doing this type of work for years and it shows in their creations. They have a great menu that they change up from time to time. But don't worry, if your favorite is no longer on the menu, they can still make it. Especially if you remember it by whatever creative name they've assigned to it.   Sometimes, I go sit at the bar when I can't get a friend to join me and read and chat. If I can't make up my mind, I'll ask the bartender to make something they are currently inspired to make, especially if it's off menu (as long as it isn't vodka). So far I've never been disappointed and it is easy to see that they really know what they are doing. It's pretty much a culinary art medium.   Two things of note, there is a dress code, it's not hard to abide by, but plan ahead. Though it does seem at times it depends who is at the door and how you treat them as to what you'll get away with.   Secondly, they have a small bites food menu that looks incredible. I've never had it but have seen dishes come out. It is well thought out and people always seem to enjoy their order.",

It's $10 for the year. As a member you get some perks :) You are also able to bring 3 guests per member. It is located at the back of Park Road Shopping center...park in the lot where Midwood Smokehouse is. I love that it is located in the neighborhood....more accessible to those who don't want to go Uptown. It is one of the most unique drinking establishments in Charlotte. It is very classy, with a beautiful marble and dark wood bar, and for larger groups there are tables and a couple glamorous round booths if you are lucky to snag em'. I have been to this bar 4 or 5 times in the last 6 months, and it has become my go-to spot when I want great cocktails that are worth every penny. I often get an Old Fashioned. They make the best Old Fashioned using an Elijah Craig 10-year. If you aren't a bourbon drinker, you will become one after tasting their  Old Fashioned. My husband and I went yesterday and sat at the bar (I would highly recommend) and told the bar tender that we weren't able to attend their Tiki Night a couple weeks ago and was wondering if we could still have some killer tiki drinks. Our bar tender was over the moon because we said MAKE WHATEVER YA LIKE! The bar has excellent drinks on their menu, but if you let the skilled bar tenders use their creativity, it is a really fun time and you learn a lot, and they don't mind people asking them questions like, \"What are you putting in that,\" or \"What is that syrup called?\" JUST GO!",

I am big on Rum & like to never repeat my drinks specially when I goto a speakeasy place. I must say this place delivers a good drink. Basic difference of a speakeasy place than a regular bar is crafting drinks with fresh ingredients with good alcohol in your drink as apposed to mixing a drink in 30 seconds. I feel really good about the service of all the folks working there & their friendly demeanor. Will be my go-to place in Charlotte when I want tasty cocktails",

The venue inside is pretty good although smallish, but the outside and the dark walk up has a 'ghetto' low class feel about it.  Once inside we were all dressed up but folks in hoodies were everywhere, so it isn't the class place it could or should be and the mgmt staff is amateur and rude.  Jeff C",

    "text": "Very cool joint. Not many like it in Charlotte. If you are reading through the reviews the only negative ones are the people that couldn't figure out their one time per year membership of $10 (yet they can manage to pay a cover at every bar in Charlotte everytime...) Also, expect a wait on the weekend. It isn't a massive place and you have to be seated. That is really my only qualm with Dot Dot Dot - I wish I could float around a bit more, hang out by the bar, find a standing table, move around. That would help with the wait time outside in the heat, but they are trying to control the environment inside so I get it. It is more a restaurant feel than a bar to me.   Overall it will be a little pricey, but the place is awesome and they have a great liquor selection. I'm a big fan even though I have only been a couple of times.",

I was lucky enough to meet a member and was invited past the bouncer, down a dark hallway, to a traditional speakeasy. The bar is packed with bottles of every sort of spirit, the back lighting providing most of the illumination for the bar area. Drinks are about $15 each, but they are hand-crafted and interesting. Don't just get a rail drink here, order something whimsical. My drink was bourbon, house-made vermouth, and truffle egg white, shaken, poured into a martini glass, then sprayed with port wine through a filter so that the bar's logo hovered on my glass. Even their lemon peels are branded with the logo.   Considering the price and exclusivity, this bar is not for everyone, but if you are looking for a unique cocktail experience, you will be hard pressed to find any place better.",

This place has a great vibe, great food and spectacular cocktails. We generally try some cocktails from the menu to see what they are offering. They were wonderful. We then ask to go off the menu and see what the bartender can come up with. They asked some great questions and went to work. They knocked it out of the park with some really fine cocktails. It's obvious they love their craft and they are artisans. We loved our conversation with all the bartenders and they took great care of us. Anytime we are in Charlotte we will be visiting again.",

The overall vibe of this restaurant is very prohibition and secretive. You have to walk down a longish brick hallways before a second hostess shows you to your seat. The decorations and atmosphere is lovely. We went on a Friday night, and I will admit it was much louder than I was expecting it to be. Overall, we had a wonder night. Courtney was our waitress and she was great. We tried the octopus, burrata, ahi tuna, and risotto fritters. All were phenomenal! As for cocktails (the real reason we are all here), I had the truffle New York Sour and my boyfriend had their hot box. The hot box was served in a Bookers Bourbon cedar box covered in smoke. It was literally being hotboxed. Absolutely recommend it!!   I'm sure we will be back again!   Follow me @jodieats_ for recipes and tasty treats",

    "text": "This has become my new favorite haunt in Charlotte. I tried it for the first time while a friend was visiting from out of town. We went for pre-dinner cocktails and liked it so much (we had considered just cancelling our dinner reservations) we returned immediately after dinner for more. I have gone back since then, and enjoyed it every bit as much.  The small plates, cocktails, ambiance, and service are all excellent. But if you're one of those people who assumes the rules shouldn't apply to you because (insert lame excuse here) then you probably shouldn't go. They take their house rules seriously, including the dress code. As we were leaving someone was turned away for wearing shorts.   However if you like a relaxed, grownup atmosphere and can act accordingly you will love this place. So read the house rules on the website before you sign up for membership and realize yes, they do apply to you too. The rules, which basically spell out \"act like a grownup\", are part of what make this place so enjoyable. You don't have to worry about some blowhard ruining your night because he thinks it's Hooters. Put away your phone, or put it on vibrate and know you'll need to go outside to make or take that call, put on your big boy/girl clothing and manners, then enjoy the evening. The cocktails and the food are worth the effort.  The food and drink menu changes so understand if you see a cocktail or dish on Yelp or elsewhere it may or may not be on the menu when you go. Just know that what is on the menu when you do go is going to be REALLY good.",

    "text": "Member's Only and it feels like it too - but without the stuffiness!  Came to the Queen City for a business trip and met up with my BIL.  He had suggested a few places, but this place's menu previews on the web intrigued me and won my heart.  Location: place took a bit to find - luckily it was raining that day, so my BIL gave us a huge hint on where the door was and we were able to find it pretty quickly.  They do have a check-in process, which went pretty quickly and the doorman was nice.  Since we were a guest - we were directed to the table pretty quickly and not hassled for getting a membership.  Once you walk in - you go through a long, dim, plain but beautiful brick-walled hallway and into the main space with a beautiful bar and seating area.  For a 6:30pm meet up on a Sunday night - it was also All Stars Weekend - it was peaceful and quiet.  Service:  After joining our party, we were quickly greeted by our server.  Our drinks were never empty, and our food was timed well, replenished, and delicious.    Food & Drink:  Dot Dot Dot didn't have to twist my arm too much on my drink order - Lily Wants a Pony.  I got it for a few reasons:  the name, a portion of the cost went to a charity who's name I can't recall, and the ingredients of vodka, triple sec, riesling, rosemary, and lime intrigued me.  It was a bit heavy on the rosemary but it was a great aperitif.  I followed that up with Hit the Wall which had that smokey mezcal and hint of cayenne pepper.  Everyone's drinks were made well and I loved how creative their cocktails were.  As for food - it is a tapas bar.  Probably one of the worst places to go to if you are super hungry - if you are like our party of 4 all foodies -where one is a chef - we ended up ordering one of nearly everything on the menu and our wallet took a hit - HOWEVER it was a great experience with lovely atmosphere to catch up with friends and family.  One after another - each dish (house cured charcuterie board, beets burrata, grilled spanish octopus, cheeseboard, braised pork belly, and fried chicken) plated beautifully like a piece of art.  All tasted delicious and we were able to split each one \"evenly\" among us - though truth be told, many of them were meant to be split between 2. The only dish that was a complete miss for for the entire table was the Smoked Duck Ham - I am torn on what made it unpleasant - the chorizo french toast or the sherry.  It just didn't marry well with the duck ham.  Our favorite dish was what we ordered last - the Fried chicken - it was lightly battered and fried just right with a delicate crisp and juicy insides.  This place was excellent and intimate - glad I found it and would return again when I get another chance.",

It really is a speakeasy. There was a $10 membership fee, but only one of us had to pay that and brought the other as a guest. It's a one-time fee and wasn't at all a problem.   Upon entering you go down dimly-lit, brick hallway where a hostess greets you and directs you into the actual bar area...very cool. Loved the atmosphere and ambience of the establishment. Bright red, bookcases, dark lighting--it all fit the bill!  We ordered the following drinks:  Strawberry fizz: Gorgeous presentation, tart/sweet flavor and really enjoyable Old Fashioned: Ordered this on our waitresses recommendation and loved it.  Hot Box: How cool is this?! A bourbon based drink served in an actual box of smoke--the visual was appealing enough, but the drink was delicious.  We also ordered a charcuterie plate which was presented nicely and had a great selection of items. I cannot wait to go back and try more food off the menu!",

Your membership fee at Costco saves you money in the long term, but a mere $10 at Dot Dot Dot gets you instant gratification with a civil, serene experience for drinks and/or food any night that fits your schedule.   There are plenty of places to get a serious cocktail in Charlotte, but many of them are Uptown, NoDa/Plaza Midwood, or SouthPark. Enter this speakeasy style establishment to meet the tastes of neighboring Myers Park residents or the young couples in Sedgefield or Madison Park. Drinks here could cap off a full day at Park Road Shopping Center.   We happened to stop in at 8pm on New Years Eve, so enjoyed seeing everyone dressed up for a long night out before we went back home to don out athleisure and get to bed well before midnight. The service was attentive and the cocktails beautiful, but we ended up trading them with each other, as the actual drinks surprised us, in a good way! We will definitely be back to try some more of the house cocktails and food, either on our own or to share the elevated experience with friends.   If your dress and act like and adult, you'll love feeling tucked away after waking down the long entryway. Yes please.",

We were also a table of 6 seated at their round booth on top of each other when there was an option to put a chair at the end of the table that no one offered us. I got the Winter Warmer to drink. It was mediocre IMO. I got the beef cheeks and fried veggies for dinner.   The food was amazing but the overall experience was not.",

It has a super speakeasy vibe to it, I never knew it even existed behind such plain industrial doors but once you're inside, you feel like you're in some James Bond movie about to crash the villains secret deal. The couches and chairs are all in the classic Chesterfield deign, there is a great dim lit ambiance and nice woodwork. A+ on the atmosphere here. As for the drinks, spectacular and well crafted with an extensive selection. The bartenders are great people as well. Really enjoyed my time here and will definitely be back!  PS. There is a membership fee of I think $5/10 for the year but you get 2/3 free guests each time so it's totally worth it.",

    "text": "Went to this spot for a drink after dinner at CO with a friend.   I will easily state this establishment is overrated. Entering at the door that says \"members only\", which is also the place to BECOME a member, can be confusing. This is where you are treated less than until you pay them the membership fee. That is fine, I understand the attempt to be \"members only\" and \"upscale\", but again, no need to act like you are holier than thou at the entrance. Especially when it wasn't worth it. 3/4 of the people that roll through here are not anything you desired to enter your facility anyway.  The only nice individual I came in contact with was our server. She was polite and helpful, though the promiscuous attire of the waitresses at this  establishment was not really necessary. No one wants, or at least I do not want, to pay $14 for a subpar cocktail and then have to see far too much when a waitress leans over a table clean up glasses. This is not a sports bar.  They boast on being a place where people can come and have like-minded behaviors: responsible, put-together, classy. However, telling someone they have to pay $10 to do so will never work or magically create that environment. It was loud and just basically obnoxious inside. One group was excruciatingly intoxicated and literally made it impossible to hear my friend talk. Not the environment one would imagine when researching this facility.  The interior is nice, a speakeasy attempt at decor done moderately well. But the service was slow. The only reason why I give this a two star and not one, was because the drink was decent. Not worth the price, but decent. I have had better at a nice restaurant.  I will never return. This is an overly rude and obnoxious environment with no need to be. You can be \"exclusive\" or \"high end\" without making your patrons regret coming here. A desperately failed attempt at a speakeasy. I will go to Broken Spoke any day over this location.",

    "text": "Overrated, overpriced, absurd. The three words that come to mind after last night's experience at Dot Dot Dot. After waiting 45 minutes for a bar that we paid a membership to, my husband and I were finally seated by Ingrid but not without snobby remarks about being a small party and the weather. We were waiting in the cold and rain. [We waited while several parties were seated before us including parties of 4-5 that were seated at double tables slid-together which could've easily been separated.] Apparently that man at the door didn't put us on the life after checking us in and checking our IDs so everyone who left was officially put on a list and seated before us. Bull shit.   I didn't like any menu options so I asked for a simple margarita. The waitress asked if I wanted well tequila and I said Jose Cuervo or a similar level would be fine. My husband ordered \"good to be king.\"  My drink was ok, very sweet and nothing special. It wasn't chilled well so I had to mix it up a lot to make it cold. My husband said he liked his and commented that it was basically all alcohol. When we asked for our bill I was appalled to see that I was charged $20 for my margarita. It wasn't even that good! They used Avion tequila which was more than I asked for and way over priced! This place is absolutely absurd and I don't plan to come back. I didn't want typical well tequila, but I also didn't ask for nor did I receive liquid gold. $20 for a 6-8oz (10oz max) margarita is ridiculous! Not to mention our waitress, who was very sweet, spilled our $12-14 and $20 drinks as she served them. You have got to be kidding me. We will [hopefully] never come back here. I wish I never spent $10 on a membership that wasn't even verified at the door.",

All the cocktails range from About $11 and up. My first two drinks did get me Tipsy and worth my money. I also had some veggie plate. It was almost like fried coated veggies. It came with some reddish spicy salsa which did give it much more taste.   Over all this is a place for a date or if you have someone visiting the Charlotte area.   Almost everybody was there with somebody. Since this is a members only lounge I can see why people were paired up.   A member can bring up to 3 guest I believe.",

Dilworth has just gotten cooler.  Dot Dot Dot can be easy to miss.  There's no real sign except the logo above an unmarked brown door in the back of the shopping center.  It's first come, first serve, so get your membership and put your name in on the No Wait app.  I got there around 7:15, but only had to wait about 20 minutes (not bad for a Friday night).  They don't let you inside unless you're being seated, so if you're not prepared to stand around, head over to one of the nearby restaurants to have a drink while you wait.  Once you finally get in, you have a very cozy atmosphere with hints of art deco decor as a nod to the 1920s.  Really cool space.  The food was fantastic.  All shareable plates, so don't expect to walk in and order a stead with potatoes.  Instead, take your time and order a plate or two at a time.  We had the Giardiniere and the Cheese & Charcuterie plates that had a beautifully plated selection.  Next we moved onto the Steak Tartare, which was a lot of fun with all the additional toppings to mix in!  Also, I recommend the chicken skewer.  It's much bigger than you expect, so between all of these snacks, you'll definitely leave satisfied. [ Overall, supper cool ambiance, amazing cocktails and great food.  If I was single, I would suggest this to a date that I want to impress.",

We sat at the bar so we'd have the best view of \"the magic happening\" and we were not disappointed. We ordered our first drinks directly off of the menu, and after that we let the bartenders work their magic. They came up with drink after drink that we absolutely loved.  The food was quite good too. Next time I'd eat a little more before arriving, as the drinks are quite strong. Or I'd only stop in for one or two drinks, since it's hard to fill up on the food items they serve. They are delicious, but not extremely large. So, for a smaller person such as myself, I found myself quite drunk after \"dinner\".  Worth it, though!   I will be back, and I will be bringing (up to 3 total) others with me. :)",

What to get: we got many drinks and loved all of them. The Richardson was good for anyone who likes manhattans and old fashioneds. We also got a Manhattan and old fashioned too! My husband did a vieux Carre and just some whiskey. Their whiskey selection is incredible and much of it is barrel pours for just them. So neat. We also got a small cheese plate which was good!  Only downside, the drinks must be a bit stronger than most, we were hurting a little the next day!",

    "text": "I've been here 3 times now, twice as a member and I think it's my favorite cocktail bar/speakeasy in Charlotte. One of the best things you can do is sit at the bar so that you can talk to the bartenders and get recommendations. For us, this means coming on Sunday nights when it's pretty quiet. On Sundays they also have a specials menu for $8 cocktails which is a super good deal considering that they are made to the same level as all of their $14/15 cocktails.  Both times my husband and I have sat at the bar, we've been served by Andrew the bartender... but actually two different Andrews! Both amazing in their own merit though.  The first Andrew treated us right for our one year anniversary and made me a tropical cocktail with a tiny message in a bottle wishing us a happy anniversary! The second Andrew recommended a drink on the menu that my husband ordered because he created it himself inspired by his grandfather and proceeded to tell us why he chose the ingredients he chose. I love the personality in their drinks and all the thoughtfulness that goes into it too! It's a great intimate space and we will definitely be making the most of our membership :)",

Has a hint of sweetness and is refreshing.   The atmosphere here is amazing. It was pretty well hidden for a first timer and made the speakeasy experience feel very real. The interior is well designed. I did feel like I was transplanted to a nice bar in New York.  The prices for drink here were pretty reasonable in my opinion. Almost every cocktail on the menu was at or below $15. I've been to other bars in Charlotte that are well over that.",

    "text": "One of the best, if not THE best cocktail bar in Charlotte. These guys are well trained industry professionals with creativity and knowledge. This is not the bar for a Rum and Coke (although I'm sure they could spruce that up and make it something memorable and amazing.)  As I'm SURE that all of you know, you need a membership in order to come here. Membership is $10 and covers you and up to 3 guests, and I'm pretty sure it lasts for a year. The Lady and I didn't have one when we arrived, so we purchased one at the door (card only, no cash at the outside podium.)  We were led inside and offered a table, but let's be real. The bar is the only place to sit here. We spent the whole evening with Andrew (the one with the longer hair, not the shorter hair one who was also working at the bar...confusing haha) who after one drink, we trusted telling him flavors that we liked and having him craft *something* for us. The cocktails here are nothing short of incredible. Everything from the flavors to the glass choice to the presentation are at the highest level. Price reflects that, but I 100% believe that the cost represents the value, and I'm willing to pay for value.  We ordered three plates of food as well - scallops, the gnocchi carbonara, and the carrots as a 'dessert'. All three were awesome - refined, and delicious. Portions were mid-sized, not quite as small as tapas but definitely not entree.   Andrew introduced us to a lot of new flavors in cocktails and shared each recipe willingly - I even took home one that I had never tried before but want to recreate!   We WILL be back here, and hopefully soon, to sit nowhere else but the bar. Dot Dot Dot is our new 'nice' night out destination. I'm sorry we waited so long.",

The fella and I have been for drinks many times and dinner once; each time we've sat at the bar, and it's been the best experience. The bartenders introduce themselves, ask what you like, get to know you, etc. - but not in a weird way where you're wishing they'd get out of your business.  What I love the most is that each bartender is so educated and well-versed, I can give them my parameters (no rum or tequila, a little sweet, a little heat), and I get a different and amazing drink each time. It's fun to watch people do what they're good at and enjoy. And the food is just as on point.  Yes, you have to pay $10 for a membership, and yes, there's a dress code, but it's also a place for grown-ups. I can't get the fella to give up his shorts when it's 20 degrees outside, and even he'll put on a pair of jeans to come here.",

We were quickly greeted and taken to seats at the bar. There weren't many patrons inside and they quickly cleared out. It was so cool having the whole place to ourselves.   We got to really talk to Andrew our bartender and Steven. We discussed the new hours, the new menu and the very diverse array of liquors they have available. Andrew was so knowledgeable and entertaining.   Andrew is an amazing bartender. We had a Bumbu Rum daiquiri, the Penicillin and after much conversation about it we tried the \"Boulevardier\" of Broken Dreams. Amazing!!! I was so impressed by all of the drinks. The daiquiri was so simple with only 3 ingredients but so tasty. Both the Penicillin and the Boulevardier were very refreshing. The Boulevardier has the signature lemon wedge with the burned Dot Dot Dot emblem on it and the Penicillin had a huge square ice cube that provided a fun optical illusion. I would definitely recommend trying any of these drinks.   I have to get back in soon to try the new food menu and try to conquer the complete drink menu!!!   All in all I'm in love with Dot Dot Dot. I'm sooo glad they are located in such a great location, support the local distilleries and have an amazing staff!!!

He check our ID's but never put our name on the list. Once we saw people who came and put our name in after we got there We said something. He was just like my fault you will get the next available table. It still took 10 mins to get a table and when we went in there were a few empty and even space at the bar. It says you have to pay $10 to become a member however no one ever check if you were a member. it also stats that you can bring only 3 guest. We say parties of 6 or more go in with only one person claiming to be a member. It seems like they don't follow their own rules and they are just out to make extra money.  Once we got in the atmosphere was a speakeasy feel. The drinks were pricey. I expected for it to be above average however it was above expectations. We ordered a drink each and our bill came to $34 excluding tax. I can by a full meal for that. The only saving grace for this place was that while we were waiting the bartender came out and offered a drink to some of the people waiting in line.",

This is a membership only club($10 per year) that prides themselves on providing excellent drinks and service, and they do it well. I had the pleasure of finally stopping in for a visit recently, and I must say I really enjoyed the vibe and the drinks.     Once you arrive, you definitely get the back alley speakeasy feel as you park and approach the door. Make sure you sign up for the membership online prior to arriving and please read the house rules and primarily their dress code. Many people have left bad reviews for Dot Dot Dot simply because they apparently can't read. No you can't enter in your tank top and flip flops, sorry folks. This is an upscale establishment and should be though of as such.   I tried several drinks here, all of which were really good. We had already eaten dinner so I didn't have food, but will be back to try that at another time. I won't go into a ton of detail on the specific drinks since they change, but they definitely have something for everyone. The hot box was the coolest drink of the night as it's brought out and \"released\" at the table surrounding you in smoky goodness. I also tried the Richardson, strawberry fizz, the Hildalgo, and Blueberry Buck. All of them were great.  I'd definitely say read the reviews, but any reviews containing complaints about the dress code or not being able to get in because membership was not purchased should be ignored. I'll be back.",

We all ordered cocktails (no food) and we all enjoyed our drinks. Most of the cocktails are around $15.00, so it is pricey, but we felt it was worth it. The vibe of Dot Dot Dot is awesome - you won't feel like you're in Charlotte! It's swanky, moody, and dimly lit. The perfect spot for a date night or fun evening out with friends.

They seat you at the bar to accommodate for busy times, so that was my only complaint, albeit a very minor one.  When I arrived, the bar was half full/half empty and I was seated between two different parties. I would have preferred the empty seat beside me for a bit, but the people I was seated next to were very kind and fun to interact with. I was expecting the bar staff to be much more conservative with their conversation after reviews I'd seen online, but I was pleased to find that there was silliness and an approachability behind the bar.  It didn't feel pretentious once you were seated.  The presentation was lovely, I'll be back many, many times.",

We had paid our membership months ago (only $10!) and had patiently awaited the opening of this private establishment that billed itself as a sort of \"Speakeasy\" atmosphere specializing in classic mixed drinks and tapa-like dishes. Our excitement was extinguished as we were first told that we would have a 20-30 minute wait (outside), but were then escorted inside immediately to find an extremely LOUD atmosphere. There were 4 of us, so we tried different \"Classic\" drinks. Overpriced for the quality, some were good, but a couple were really bad! (That is their specialty?) We ordered almost every item on the food menu: Arrancini, Tempura veggies, Pork skewers, Charcuterie and Shrimp. Quantities were very small (and we KNOW tapas) and just average flavors. I WILL say that they did a good job with the decor; rich colors, nice lamps, pretty bar and attractive ceiling and wall designs, but our corner booth was too warm and the noise overwhelming. I was expecting white tablecloths, candles, \"Crooner\" music and good food/drinks. ...Been there, done that, won't be back! P.S. Dessert at nearby Amelie's...Excellent!!!",

The cocktails are good ($12-18), the place is loud (?consider replacing the tin ceiling with red velvet) Not sure I feel the need to go back.",

    "text": "The wife and I tried to get in Saturday evening around 11:00 PM but the wait was 45 minutes so I picked up my membership card and went home. Not a negative experience.  We were just tired and decided to try again later.  We live about 200 paces from the front door so no big deal.  We tried again early Sunday evening and got right in.  Although they give you a membership card what you really need to get in is your driver's license.  My wife didn't have hers but they let us in but told us to make sure and have proper ID next time.  Once the doorman lets you in you walk down a long hallway to the hostess.  She escorts you through another door and seats you.  The decor is beautiful.  No TVs which is nice.  Noise level was low but not many people were there.  We sat at a table near the exit.  Waitress was immediately there to take our order.   My wife ordered a Thai Basil Smash and I ordered a Manhattan.  We had already had dinner but wanted to try a food item on the menu so we ordered the GIARDINIERE.  As we received our appetizer the waitress brought us a gin amuse-bouche (on the house appetizer) drink.  It was a little sweet but enjoyable.  The appetizer was really good.  It included some warm almonds, olives, and pickled vegetables.  You could tell by the quality of the vegetables that an experienced chef is in the kitchen.  It tasted very fresh and tangy.  We enjoyed the cocktails as well.    Their House Rules are posted on their website and the 3rd rule is proper dress is required but doesn't go into detail.  It says to refer to rule 2 which says don't be a jerk.  I discussed the dress code with the waitress and she told me its business casual.  No t-shirts, shorts or flip flops.  Apparently the no flip-flop rules is for men only (sexist?). However, I noticed the guy sitting two tables over was wearing shorts and flip flops.  Obviously, they aren't enforcing that rule yet.    Overall it was a pleasant experience and it met my expectations.  It is definitely a pricey experience so be prepared to spend some money.  I will visit occasionally as it is a little expensive for my entertainment budget.",

I thought this was a great concept and the other 7,100 people who became members before me must have thought the same thing. The main issue was the noise inside which was ridiculous at 6:00pm on a Thursday with half of the establishment empty. By the time my girlfriend and I left (6:30) we were yelling across the table at each other. Also the drinks weren't amazing for the prices. I got the Hot Box and my girlfriend got the Mia Tai and they were decent. You can get better drinks in South Park for the price.",

The app did not let you register 5 people for the wait list and we instead registered for 4. When we showed up, we were told we were in the wrong for showing up with one more person and were forced to go back on the wait list which was another 40 minutes (there was no line outside and people were pouring out of the bar). You guys need to do some work with your seating methods. How does one person cause you to have to wait another 40 minutes to be seated? I would like to understand before I come back. I will also be urging others to avoid until this is figured out.",

Drinks were well-balanced and tasty, food was delicious, service was attentive and friendly.  The decor is swanky and I love the lack of TVs.  I also love that the barstools are comfortable for hours!!  My other favorite bar in Charlotte is perfect in every way except that the barstools cut off your circulation after about 20 minutes, the ones at Dot Dot Dot don't do that.  The music here is also perfect for the intended atmosphere and isn't so loud that you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  The only con for me is that it's not closer to my office or home, but I still expect to go there a couple times a month.",

People need to realize that it is a private club, and it's much easier to buy a membership online rather than waiting until you get to the door.  The place his a cool, shill, but upscale vibe. If you want a innovative, expertly crafted cocktail this is the place to go, I don;t mind paying for quality, and I've never been disappointed at Dot Dot Dot. The sames goes for the food, which is mostly tapas fare, creative, unique, and delicious.  Let;s be clear... this is not the place to chug Bud Lite, and scarf down chicken wings... and thank God it's Not.  It's a classic and classy cocktail bar... something not often found in Charlotte.  I also truly appreciate the dress code. I don;t want to be surrounded by flip flops and smelly feet, or people in shorts dressed like they're going to the lake, while I'm trying to enjoy a single malt scotch.  Again 5 stars for the ambiance, cocktails, and food.",

After all, some places here in Charlotte that are in prime locations are so underwhelming what good could possible come out of a cocktail bar that is located in such an odd spot?  Well, my concerns were unfounded. This place is sexy! Once you get through the entrance door and walk down the hallway that is soberly lid you enter the main room that features some tin ceilings and Art Deco metalwork. No loud music and NO TV!!! Extra points for the latter!  The cocktails are well done. It is truly refreshing that there are actually bartenders in Charlotte who truly know how to mix certain drinks.   The door should be even more strict and certain procedures re the membership card need to be ironed out. Why do I have one if you only want my ID anyway? But this is just a minor flaw.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Management is very interested in making sure that guests enjoy the place...and the drinks.  Congratulations on a great addition to the Charlotte bar scene!",

Honestly I can appreciate that your website provides information on what to expect. It should be viewed as being proactive. But then you experience some patrons who think that they are the exception to all the worlds rules. I think the dress code idea is necessary, it sort of puts everyone on the same playing field and creating some inclusiveness within the establishment.

We casually sat at the bar with Ashley and Pete (superb bar-keeps) who know their craft. I drank a True Manhattan and it was divine. This is a True Speak-Easy. The small plate short ribs are delicious; the best I've had in Charlotte.  If you want to escape the urban factor and have a world-class experience, then this is your place to go.   What you won't find at Dot Dot Dot is FUBU, flip-flops and club wear. What you WILL find is an enchanting experience to remember.   Meir",

    "text": "Neat new addition to the back lot at Park Road Shopping Center. My wife and I stopped in for a pre-dinner drink to celebrate our anniversary. First off, I recommend checking out the website and purchasing a membership in advance of your visit. It is $10 and allows you to bring up to 3 guests. When you show up, they scan your driver's licence and in you go. Overall entry ambiance is pretty neat - you walk down a narrow brick corridor, which opens up to the actual room at the end. I will say this place was larger than I expected and was fairly busy and loud (to be expected on a Friday night). I will say the noise is what cost them my 5th star as I'm used to the Cellar or the Punch Room where it is a bit quieter and feels a bit more exclusive. However, I was impressed with the service. When we told our waitress that it was our anniversary, she brought out 2 glasses of champagne on the house. As for the drinks, I ended up ordering the Hot Box - a mix of bourbon, scotch, and bitters smoked with pecan wood. The drink was perfectly mixed and the presentation was fun as it is brought out in a box with smoke from the wood embers. Overall I will consider returning to check out more of their drink menu and perhaps part of their food menu.",

Once you get in the decor is very intimate. The service was great. We had three drinks all very unique which were recommended by the waitress. I was hesitant of mine at first because it had liquor and red wine in it but it turned out to be very good. We ordered the small plate beef tartare and it was also great. I would recommend this place and definitely would come back.",

    "text": "Fantastic venue. Would give it 4 or 5 stars for ambience, and beverage menu. However am giving it 2 stars for repeated poor service on an administrative level. Visited for the first time in early Jan 2018 with friends. Loved it. Went online the next day and purchased the $10 membership. Never received an email confirm. Never received the card in the mail. Called and left 2 messages (that were never returned) asking when it would be mailed. The $10 was indeed charged to my AMEX on 1/14/18.  Went back with several friends on Thurs May 17th. We arrived at 8pm. Explained the situation to the guy working the front door. He said I was \"not in the system\" but he would have a manager talk with me to resolve after I explained the charge date and the never returned calls. When we arrived - the place was at most 20% filled. After an hour I asked the waitress about the manager and she rolled her eyes and said said, \"sorry, we are so unorganized here\". Can anyone who works there and reads this - please tell me who to call to resolve. Seems ridiculous that this is hard to resolve as we are only talking about $10. But evidently it is. I am posting this as i find it hard to believe I am the sole customer to experience this issue.",
