I won't reminisce over the first visit as it was quite some time ago, but hubs and I strolled in there to grab a quick bite before heading to a show in Concord. Our server Colleen was fantastic - she seriously should work at Disneyland because that woman is so happy. She was also incredibly friendly, professional and efficient, making sure that we were in and out of there for our show with plenty of time to spare.   Beyond the tasty (I presume freshly baked bread), I ordered the cavatelli primavera - an large portion of finely cooked cavatelli pasta loaded with tons of veggies in a light marinara sauce. The pasta was just what I was looking for and the veggies were fresh - my complaint? The sauce was quite bland. Perhaps more crushed red pepper? More garlic? More BAM? Regardless, I had leftover to eat for lunch for another day and for the price, $14.95, it was a ton of food.   One an alternate note, make sure you note the price of the specials if you're interested in them...hubs and I were both surprised that his chicken & pasta dish was $22. It was roughly the same portion and similar ingredients to my dish and seemed as if the chicken breast cost added $7 to the price. Strange. Regardless, next time I'm  in the University area I definitely want to try their tiramisu - I hear it's phenomenal!",

We ordered appetizers for the table one of which included the fried calamari. While I didn't have any the table agreed it was quite salty. I ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce for my main entree. My guess is that the gnocchi was not homemade. It was good, but not a meal I would go out of my way to have again. The potion sizes are also very large; Split when possible!",

Which would include a salad, entree along with soft drinks, teas & coffee. However I was charged at the end for alcoholic beverages which was fine- but then was also charged for 8 more coffees. I called for about a week to get my credit card credited back for the $25 in coffee. Over the course of the week I was told the manager wasn't available but took my info and would call me back. Never did. Finally a week later I was able to get a hold of the owner/manager. The manager was beyond rude and actually was so rude he hung up on me. Basically told me that if a person started drinking a sofa but then had a coffee at the end of the meal it wasn't included because they changed the beverage. I have never heard of this. It's a shame because the pasta was good, not the best I have had... but still good. I won't be back & be sure to tell others that this place is not a place to support for the mere fact that the owner could careless about the value of his patrons.",

This dish was so good, it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the Bake Zitti which was great as well. For both of our meals plus wine and a few beers we paid an average of 60+ bucks.

Generally New York style, definitely better than average. Great quantity and quality of toppings (ordered pepperoni with sausage one half, meatball the other) and it was loaded (see pic). Beg to differ on the review that said their Italian sausage is bland, as the stuff the put on the pizza had a good little kick. Probably more like a 3 1/2 star pizza, but they get the extra half star for speed, friendliness, topping quantity, and the size of a medium was more like a large for $17. Add-in that this is North Carolina and I'm a pizza snob from Chicago. Solid za all around. Crispy outside, chewy inside crust, good not great. Toppings, cheese, and sauce all authentic. If you're in a hotel in University City like me and in the mood for a good pizza that crushes the chain joints, find a way to pick up one from here. Shame they don't deliver in an area surrounded by hotels.",

HUGE portion sizes. Bruschetta bread was very good, but the tomatoes were kinda runny. The tomatoes with the the bread soaked up some of  it so it made it slightly soggy.

And it tasted great.  At first when I ordered it, I immediately regretted it due to my recent reading of Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential (eating seafood on a Monday or Tuesday after a weekend is probably not a good idea)... but it tasted great to me and I was very happy about my choice.  Our server was very prompt and took care of our refills.  Even adding a little color and warmth to our lunch experience.  Almost as if he was a long lost distant italian uncle you've always wanted.  My friend and I cleaned our plates and he came over with a sad expression and said, \"you guys didn't like it! [insert italian accent here]\"  We had a good laugh.  He was very good about offering us fresh ground pepper for our salads along with the freshly grated cheese over your dish.  When you first walk in, Ciro's has a quality about it that almost makes it formal, but it seemed okay for a casual lunch.  I've had dinner here before and don't exactly remember feeling under-dressed... but that was a while back.  WARNING:  I enjoyed their bread WAY too much.  Especially when they drop a bottle of olive oil (looks like rosemary and garlic infused) and bottle of balsamic on the table for you to make your own dipping oil.  Be warned.... liquid crack soaked up in warm bread!",

We stopped in initially to ask to look at a menu. The guy upfront gave us an annoyed stare and then pointed to their to-go menus. He didn't even hand it to us! He then walked away. Fast forward to us figuring out that there isn't much in this shopping center. We got seated and our waitress, while attentive, was just not all that friendly. They really try to push their salads on you. I heard, after everytime someone ordered, they would say \"Would you like a salad with that?\". Sneaky. I originally had not wanted a salad but agreed to it. Bad idea, the thing was horribly bland - my coworker agreed.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs which is hard to screw up, but it didn't have any \"special sauce\" like the menu suggested. This was plain kroger sauce for sure. And another note, spaghetti and meatball should never be $15, that is just a ridiculous price. I can't remember what my coworker got but I do remember the price ($21) and I do remember it had chicken and mushrooms. She said it was bland as well. The bread, while it wasn't hard, wasn't that great tasting either. Also note that the salads they get you to order are $3 something each.  Overall, for the final price of the meal for 2 (over $50), I was not amused. They're lucky this was a business expense because had I had to pay here, I don't know if I would even give it two stars.",

And I am usually with a large group of 5 or more people.  No one in my group has ever had a bad meal.  Everyone always raves about how delicious everything is.  There is bread served with oil/balsamic which is delicious.  The older man who places the accordion is very friendly and entertaining (although at times he plays too loud...he means well!) Overall, one of my favoriate restaurants in the area.  I am very surprised at some of the negative views, as I am a very picky food person! :)  I can always tell when food isn't fresh, or prepared too far ahead of time, etc.  Never noticed this at Ciro's.

Two orders of fried calamari were crunchy with the lightest of batters. All of the entrees were fantastic from veal Parmesan to pasta carbonara. And a selection of a nice 2013 Colluta Cabernet was perfect. There's nothing like accordion music to complete the ideal meal. It was so good, I forgot to take pictures!",

The plastic/parchment covers over the table cloth's lets you know right away that this place isn't that high end.  They don't have a website???  Don't get me wrong, its not bad, its just not that good.  Its probably one of the best restaurants in the area besides Thai House, now that Melting Pot is closed.  I can't think of too many other places in the area where a college kid should bring a date.  The apps were pretty good.  I had the mussels, calamari, and antipasto.  The mussels were a little salty but a pretty good sized portion.  The calamari wasn't quite as large of a potion but was decent.  Light airy batter and relatively tender squid.  The antipasto had ham that could have easily been lunch meat.  The balsamic wasn't anything special either.  I did like the artichokes and parmesan chunks though.  After tolerable but uneventful apps and looking at an overpriced wine menu we just decided to walk over to wine vault for some booze and live music and grab a snack later on.  Bottom line, its good for the area, but that ain't saying much.  Macaroni Grill may be a better option and I rarely suggest chain restaurants.",

Someone suggested Ciro's and we were all able to agree on it.  We had 6:00 reservations and I was surprised how busy it was in there. There must have been some kind of happy hour/mixer in the bar area, it was packed. Who knew!  Overall the service was stellar! We had someone extra joining us so they added an extra table to our table, no problem. Our waiter made recommendations and checked on us the perfect amount - I wish I remembered his name to give him a shout out, he was great. They were also really accommodating about special requests on people's orders - and everything came out right.   The menu is huge - ranging from traditional hearty Italian (chicken parm) to lighter healthy fare (grilled salmon salad). Everyone seemed happy with their meals, unusual that no one has an issue when there are 9 people.  The table shared the Calamari, wow, great reco from the waiter! Just lightly battered and fried and very fresh (not chewy like it was frozen) yum! I tried the Chicken Lucia - sauteed chicken in a white wine sauce with artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. Really delicious.  I will definitely stop by Ciro's again if another work dinner pops up. Impressed!",

    "text": "Went to Ciro's for the first time with a group of former coworkers for our quarterly get-together and was quite impressed...and I'm already ready to go back!  I ordered the Gnocchi w/shrimp in a pink sauce.  YUM.  The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked.  Admittedly it seemed as though they were a teensy bit stingy w/the shrimp at first glance, but it turned out to be just enough.  By the time you finish those & the doughy gnocchi you're full!  Also threw in a Caesar side salad & I must say they did a good job.  Dressing wasn't too bland or overpowering.  Ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo to take back to the other half, and even reheated it was delicious.  Quite flavorful actually.   I will say that they're a little pricey, but it was worth it since it was a ''special'' gathering.  For the gnocchi, fettuccini and one Tirimisu for me (and a soft drink), my total was just over $50 including tip.  Not cheap for sure, but I'll give'em a pass since it was so tasty.  Atmosphre was laid back and casual, but not a Red Robin type casual.  It IS a somewhat nicer Italian restaurant after all.  During dinner an older gentleman (we're thinking he may have been the owner?) began walking around playing his accordion.  While the accordion may seem corny, it was actually quite festive & jovial--made me wanna wave my napkin around & dance a bit!  If you're in the University Village & would like to partake in a slightly upscale (I said slightly) Italian meal, then head over to Ciro's.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

I liked the dessert menu, but we were too full so we didn't get any. Beautiful restaurant with great prices and a very courteous staff. Wished I lived closer so I could go here more often!",

The patio was breezy and comfortable, the live music was enchanting, the customer service with Carima was warm and professional, and the food was delicious. You can tell when a restaurant and the chef cares about the food. This will now be our only  go-to spot for Italian in Charlotte.

The waiter was professional, polite and on cue every step of the way with subtle humor as well.  Music live by accordion added nice ambiance to the setting.  The veggie calzone was excellent. The Marsala and marinara were a bit in the sweet side.  We concluded sherry but we didn't confirm.  The tiramisu and canolli were huge.  Over the top huge.  Very much made to be shared.

The restaurant was clean and the bathrooms were attended to. The food was ok, not bad, but certainly not gourmet Italian. We started with bruschetta which was good, lots of fresh basil. Not sure they used the right bread as it got soggy pretty fast. Since they don't have thin crust pizza, I opted for spaghetti and meatballs. Again, it was ok, not great. The sauce did not have much flavor and the meatballs were rather dry and tough. The spaghetti was just regular out of box. In the end, I was really hungry so the meal was not bad, but certainly not a place I would rush back to for the food. Prices seemed kind of high to me based on the quality of the food.  I am giving it 4 stars on the strength of the service although in reality it is a 3.5 star restaurant.",

We had the restaurant to ourselves, as it appears the restaurant receives a lot of carry out orders at lunch time rather than sit down dining. Michael was our server, he was accommodating, answered questions on the menu. My Mom and I had lasagna which we love and always have to try at every Italian restaurant we try. The house side salad is delicious with fresh greens, balsamic vinaigrette with tomatoes, onions, croutons and black olives - the black olives and the vinaigrette pair well together. My Dad had their homemade soup, which he loved and then a caesar salad as his main dish. Michael our server recommended the meat sauce to go with the lasagna and it was delicious from the first bite truly amazing homemade sauce! My Mom had marinara sauce - we enjoyed every bite of the lasagna and now we know why friend's parents recommended Ciro's their food is truly delicious, great Italian in Charlotte by UNC. Thank you Michael and Ciro's for great meal during our recent family trip to Charlotte.",

Food - I had the gnocchi with marinara. This is where I was disappointed. The sauce was very bland (no actual flavor), acidic, salty. It honestly tasted like the cheap can of hunts tomato sauce, no seasoning. The gnocchi pasta itself was good.   Atmosphere - It was a nice restaurant, white table clothes and soft music. If they updated the seating chairs, it would complete the nice look they are going for.",

    "text": "I am a LOVER of Italian Food, Ciro's makes me happy.   Ciro's serves traditional Italian cuisine and is located in The Shoppes at University Place, so just along the boardwalk and a couple other restaurants and bars. It's nicely decorated, not too huge - giving you mom & pop's Italian eatery vibes.   The food here is good, and the menu is extensive. They have a great wine list as well. After being seated, they serve complimentary bread for the table to be eaten with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread is good, and our waiter brought out more when he realized we'd gone through all of it.   As I mentioned before, the menu is extensive. There is PLENTY to choose from. Of my favorites that I've tried, the penne a la vodka is delicious along with the fried calamari and the shrimp and spinach gnocchi.  The portions are generous as well, I have always had leftovers to take back after getting too full. I do think the kitchen could use a little spicing up, when it comes to flavor - but nothing that would deter me from coming back.  My actual favorite part of this place is the service. My waiter was pretty awesome and accommodated every need we had. He even listened to some constructive criticism we had on the food/sauces.  If you are in the area or craving Italian, Ciro's is always a solid option. God knows we all need some pasta and a little wine for dinner sometimes. :)",

    "text": "This place has been here for a while. I've been here before, back before smart phones or Yelp existed. I remember It being ok but figured I need another try before posting about It. Today was the right day to do It since my kids opted for Cava across the street for the 3rd time this week and I was done with it.   I ordered over the phone - chicken Marsala with spaghetti with oil and garlic. When I walked in to the restaurant, you immediately smell cheese. Thay's a good sign because i just know they're using REAL parm, not the kind you shake from a plastic green jar. A lady at the bar asked me to walk towards the back to get my food. It's kind of weird that you have to walk into a different room of the place, passing by tables to get to your takeout order. Most places have It right by the door which I prefer. But that's just me being petty. The important stuff here is the food.   The food!!! Oh, It was divine! The chicken was a tad small but It was moist, tender and cooked just right! My favorite part of the dish are the mushrooms. Boy, they give you quite a bit of mushrooms - and I polished off every single one! The spaghetti was perfect. I'm not a fan of al dente pasta but I don't like It mushy either. This place made It just right! Touch of oil and garlic brought the dish up a notch. They even gave me a small container of Parmesan cheese and half a loaf of bread - better to soak the sauce with. Which was also delicious. It was so much food! And It was only $11. SCORE!!!",

I pretty much get the exact same thing. Penne Quattro with extra garlic. Love me some garlic btw. I sometimes ask for a different type of pasta to switch it up. I also get a Caesar salad which is absolutely heavenly and I also get the garlic cheese bread. The cheese bread comes with a marinara sauce for dipping which I never use. I'm not a fan of this sauce. Seems pretty blah to me.   Service wise everyone is super nice and pretty attentive. This used to be my go to restaurant for a linen lunch for those moments you just need to upgrade your life mid day. It was a nice pick me up. They have now changed to paper napkins for lunch. I stopped coming here for a while but pregnancy brought me back. All in all I highly recommend this place.",

So let's call it 3.5 stars because it's definitely A-OK plus if I average the visits together.  I've sampled a few different items including lasagna and chicken parmigiana.  I liked the lasagna and liked the chicken parm the first time I had it but not so much the second time.  That time it was almost as if there were a new chef in the kitchen or they ran out of tomato sauce and had to run to the grocery store to pick up a few jars off the shelf.  Service on each visit has been good, including when dining with a large group of work colleagues on one occasion which can sometimes create a challenge for staff and kitchen.",

Once I was finally approached after about 5 minutes, the experience improved. Complimentary bread is so soft and simple, served with oil and vinegar for dipping. I ordered the salmon surprise special. It was beautiful and flavorful with a light risotto, artichoke, red pepper. But rather one dimensional and wow I should've checked the price... $15 plus $2 for tea. Very pricey lunch. Service turned out well overall. Just remember the 30 second greet rule.",

The reason this is not a five star is twofold: (1) the bread that they give you in the beginning of the meal is nothing special; and (2) the amount of onions in the penne alla vodka is disturbing.  I've never had onions in it but I like onions so I didn't think anything of it.  I had to literally eat around them because it was just too much.  We will be back!",
