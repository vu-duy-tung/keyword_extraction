    "text": "I have always enjoyed this place. Like most chain restaurants, they change their menu often.  The menu prices seem much higher than usual since the last menu change. They've also rid some of the combination deals you may be used to. Basically, if you haven't been here in awhile, be prepared to spend more money than you were used to.   However, I still enjoy the food here, although due to the prices, I can't dine here as often as I have in the past. I have also become vegetarian recently so it's hard to find dishes that suit us herbivores in my zip code.   That hasn't been a too much of a problem the two times I've been here since though. The first time, I ordered a salad with grilled chicken, asking to have it without the chicken. Although the waitress gave a funny look (which I'm used to by now), she was still very helpful, offering to add other veggies or black beans. They even gave me a side salad with it for only a dollar, which was nice. Some places act as if they've never heard of a vegetarian and panic when I ask that they just leave out the meat. Others scoff, and others even charge MORE to leave out meat!?!? This place has handled it well so far.  The second time, I was very happy to see that they had a black bean burger on the menu and I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Their smoothies are good too.   Every time I've come here (for years), the staff has been friendly.   It can be and feel a bit crowded at times, as they pack in as many tables and chairs as possible and you have to dodge them just to walk to and from your table (depending on where you're seated in the building as the tables to the right of the entrance are more crowded than the left side).   I've never had to wait forever for food. It's always been quick to average.   My girlfriend's daughter got a \"kid's\" chicken sandwich, which not only looked very delicious (for a dead chicken), but was large enough to even make me full if I had eaten it. It was only around $5.00 to boot. She loved it.",

    "text": "T.G.I.F., four simple letters universally know to mean one thing, and one thing only.  That all changed this evening when I came to the realization that I'veI had it all wrong all these years.  Thank God It's Fridays was a cute concept, but from this day forward those 4 letters strung together will stand for \"This Guy is Full.\"  The spread the wonderful folks at Friday's laid out in front of me for supper this evening led me to conclusion, and I can't thank them enough for showing me the light.  Turkey Avocado BLT, need I say more?  Probably not, but I will anyways.  Upon my first bite a bold check mark was immediately placed in the box next to each of the 3 S's i'm looking for in every and any dining experience.  Scrumptious, check. Succulent, check. Special, yep you guessed it, check.  I love a good BLT, and usually order one when I'm hungry but not starving.  Just looking for a little something to wet my beak not stuff my gullet.  What the visionaries behind the scenes at Friday's have achieved with this creation accomplishes both.  If you're looking for a sure thing, this is as sure as they come.  Don't believe, that's your choice.  Be unhappy, and believe what you want. I mean there are people who are still convinced the earth is flat.  The only reason for a lack of the 5th star is that service was not up to par with the standard I have come to expect from Friday's.  Since it was a busy Saturday night and they provided not only this delectable treat but unmatched conversation and atmosphere, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.  Friday's keep up the good work, and rest easy tonight knowing that you're exceptional culinary work has opened up the mind of at least one royal patron to question everything they thought they knew about the 4 simple letters T.G.I.F.",

The pretzel appetizer was a frozen roll that was microwaved for couple of minutes. The sliders were so hard, my son lost his wiggly tooth and it actually made a knocking sound when it was dropped on the table. The water with lemon, however, was excellent. The kids meal hamburgers are sliders. My daughter  could  not eat her burnt slider so we asked for a regular  burger that came back burnt as well. That's what you get for going to a Friday's on  Wednesday. Something tells me the day of the week  would not make a difference.",

    "text": "Absolutely unacceptable service.  It has been a very long time since i have actually gotten up and left a restaurant because of bad service, but let me tell you, it was the best thing that I did this evening.  My family decided to take a trip to TGI Fridays because it has been a while since we have visited this location and we were craving the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.  Our visit was on Saturday evening. We arrived around 8:40, actually got a front parking spot in front of the door, and had less than a five minute wait. So far so good, then we were seated and promptly entered the \"twilight zone\".  Our server came over after about 7 minutes, took our drink order and we took the opportunity to  order the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.  Now, after 8 minutes our fried green beans and wasabi ranch arrived, but we still have yet to receive our drinks. We had two waters and a sweet tea.  We were told that it would be a few minutes before the sweet tea was ready.  By now,  two tables have been seated a two top right behind us and a four top across from us. They were promptly greeted  by our server and they began their dining experience.  We ordered a Jack Daniel's cheeseburger, the sizzling chicken and shrimp and a Friday's House Salad (Romaine, red cabbage, grape tomato, cucumber, mixed cheese and focaccia croutons with choice of dressing and a hot garlic bread stick.) I have added the description as shown on the website and menu. Ours did not come with the bread stick.  When we asked the server, he stated that it did not come with one, we stated that the menu said it did.  After my wife finished the salad he obliged with 2 hot garlic bread sticks, but what was the point, the salad was already finished.  So thirty minutes passed and each of the tables received their salads, and meals that came in after us, we felt we had been neglected enough.  This is where I approached the front hostess stand, requested the manager, and let her know how this was just unacceptable.  The manager stated that it was just a few more minutes, and I let her know that my family had already left and was in the car.  As a courtesy, I let her know that I was willing to pay for the tea, salad and fried green beans, but we were not going to hang around any longer.  She insisted that we wait and have it boxed to go, but I declined, as it should have been presented as ordered in a timely manner at our table, not in a to go box.  (Just remember the food was still not even ready).  The manager said it was not necessary to pay, but this is just not acceptable at a dining establishment.  I am getting really frustrated at the level of incompetence in businesses, and the lack of willingness to provide an effort to do very basic skills. Please take a moment and train the employees of the importance of serving others by understanding the menu and by taking care of the needs in a timely manner.  If one cannot handle more than 4 tables, then one may need a new job.  I am pretty sure that by the other yelp reviews, I am not the only one who is NOT thinking TGI Friday!  Just on a side note: Had I not stopped by the hostess stand and ask for the manager, the server would have never noticed we were gone?  Now that's sad!",

We have ate here on mulitple occassions and have been satisifed but this time we were not. First of all, our salads came out and they were bland with hardly any toppings. My steak came out hard and tuff that you could barely cut it. I was missing my mashed potates and partner was missing his mac n cheese. We only got 1 refill while we were here. Meanwhile the bartenders children and baby mama walk up to the bar and the bartender completely stops what hes doing and starts playing with his children. The child maybe age 4 goes behind the bar and the management seemee not to care.  Then he even walks outside with his children. The bartender wasn't focused at all on his job. He was very rude and no smile what so ever. Didnt even introduce himself. Never asked if he could help us with anything, never asked if we were ok nor never came to check on us.",

Wifey and i would get take out about once every month or two  since I like the Jack Daniels burger and wife likes the Jack Daniels chicken nuggets.  This is literally the third time this has happened. I ordered my usual burger with EXTRA JD on the side. This came as a regular cheeseburger with jack cheese no JD sauce on burger or on side and no bacon. Wife got her usual JD chicken nuggets which is usually a pretty good portion talking maybe 15 nuggets which is reasonable since they cost $11 dollars. However this time 8 lierally 8 for $11. What a deal right? Anyways they also seem to always forget the kids meal. Then when you ask them for it they get an attitude. Like i said we eat there once every month or two so for us tipping $6 on a $40 take out order that we enjoy is no big deal. I really wish i had asked for the tip back as the bar tender couldnt be bothered and i had to ask a server for help or at least give the tip to the waiter. So in summary if you eat here eat in and do not get take out. If you must get take out CHECK and double check the order before you leave. Also the manager in his green pastel shirt was 0 help and just ignored me when i tried to get his attention. I wish i were a secret shopper",

Brought promptly.  Took dinner order.  No appetizers.  FROM THERE FELL OFF THE RAILS. One order ribeye/shrimp w/ broccoli n cheeze.  Salad. Other order full slab of ribs w/ spinach.  Salad. One drink raspberry iced tea. Did not bring salads for over 20 minutes.  Then dinner right behind it. Brought 2 orders of broccoli n cheese.  NO shrimp.  That took another 20 minutes. . Refill of raspberry iced tea was not drinkable. Was like had spoiled milk in it. Only response, kitchen really super busy.... Hope gets better.",

The salad was mainly all lettuce.  My husband couldn't eat the shrimp or fried pork. It tasted terrible. We won't order from this Fridays again.",

Our server checked on us twice. Once right when the food came and then when we were about finished.  The cajun chix and shrimp pasta was good, but a bit too spicy for me.  And they charge extra if you want bread sticks with your pasta  App sizes are small for the price they charge.    The hostess is also rude.  She actually questioned us on our way out if we paid our bill.  Trust me It would be pretty hard to run out on the bill with young children in tow.  Put in a complaint but highly doubt anything will come of it.  Overall, I hate to say...it's chain.  Because I've been to other locations that was good.  This one, even without the service problems ranks very low for us.",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!! I went for dinner Sunday night, with hopes of watching a couple games while I dined. I sat in the bar area and I had to wait 14 minutes for anyone to greet me and take my order. I got my potstickers and meatballs, both of which were lukewarm at best! I told my server, who took them both away without any apology. My food was then brought back to me by another server who simply threw it all down in front of me and walked off. I ate that one round and after waiting what had to be no less than 20 minutes to see my server and to get a refill on my water, I asked for the check and to speak with the manager. My server returned with my check told me the manager would be over shortly to speak with me. I paid and waited to speak with a member of the managers staff. I waited a full 30 minutes and NO MANAGER EVER CAME OVER TO MY TABLE! When I asked my server again about speaking to a manager, I was told to please be patient and someone would get to me as soon as they could. This is not only unprofessional on part of the server, but also on part of the management staff. A complaint from a patron should be addressed immediately or at the very least the patron should be informed that their concerns are important and will be taken care of in a TIMELY MANNER. I waited another 30 minutes before finally leaving and deciding to right this review. While I would love to give them another chance, I highly doubt it matters to anyone at this location.",

My friend and I stopped in Saturday night, it was pretty late when we got there and the hostess asked if we would mind sitting at the bar. We said that was no problem at all! The waitress greeted us immediately and said any of the waiters we saw could help us! Sweet!   We took a little bit of time to order, but ended up going with the wings with Caribbean Rum sauce and chose your own appetizer with crispy green beans, pot stickers and garlic Parmesan boneless wings.   The food arrived pretty quickly, but the sauces on our wings were wrong, but the waitress apologized and put another order in right away. The crispy green beans and pot stickers were hot and delicious. Once our second order of wings arrived we were good to go!   We both left full and happy. So I'd say again, overall a solid visit!",

My date and I were seated almost right away.  At first the server wanted to sit us at a tiny corner table by a woman who was on her phone.  The corner was dark and the lady was seated so close to the table she could have used the salt shaker from our table without having to get up.  My date advised that we did not want that table and were seated at a high-top table near the bar.  The TV's above the bar were one enabling us to catch the March Madness game.  We ordered a couple of drinks and then our food.  The server was patient and pleasant and I liked that.  She came back more than once while we talked and reviewed the menu.  We placed a rather uncomplicated order and it came out correctly done.  I had a BBQ chicken salad and my date ordered Shrimp Pasta with a side salad.  The food was prepared as described on the menu but nothing had much taste.  I will continue to go there for convenience but the food needs more flavor to get a higher grade from me.  Although my salad had all of the ingredients described on the menu, they were very stingy with the avocado and the BBQ sauce tasted like a cheap jar sauce.  I am sure with a little imagination the cooks here can do better.  I will look for that the next time I have a meeting in their place.",

And not just the plain old vodka and olive but fun drinks too - I had a chocolate martini and a pink pink Cosmo (which they put cotton candy in and fill from the shaker at your table). Sadly the food was only so so. The mozzarella sticks were great, the pot stickers and buffalo wings were nothing special and the potato skins are exactly what you get when you buy the TGI Fridays frozen loaded potato skins at the grocery store. While the experience was just ok the price was definitely worth a return visit especially now that we have narrowed down the appetizers we liked",

The bad news - the staff (that night anyway) was super unfriendly. I placed a pick-up order. Went in to get it - they directed me to the bar - a football game was playing (12-17-17). The bar tender acted like I ruined her night by coming in to get my order. She had to stop watching the game for 2 minutes! She looked at me with obvious negativity. Then handed off my food without speaking or looking at me. Wow... horrible experience. BTW - It wasn't even a Panthers game - I should deduct another star for that!",

The Cobb salad was perfect size and green goddess dressing was very tasty.  Sweet tea refills kept coming and was perfectly sweet, got one for the road too.  Used to love this place 30 years ago, so the chain must be doing something right still, the staff again made this a nice night out.",

    "text": "My partner & I had a horrible at the TGIF at Rivergate in the Steelecreek area in Charlotte, NC. My partner and I had viewed a special on our phone that TGIF was running. When got to the table the waiter was somewhat familiar with it, but was a little unsure.  We showed him the promotion on the phone which was a meat combo \"2 grill favorites\" and 2 sides. The waiter said ok and took our order. 5-10 mins later the waiter came back and said we can't do that. We had a hard time understanding what was going on from what the waiter was trying to say so we ask for a manager. Daniel came by first said that TGIF ran promotions that were only for carryout. So, we asked \"you mean for us to get this special we have to get our food to go?\" and he said yes....he admitted that it was a dumb and confusing promotion that TGIF ran and then we talked more and Showed him the promotion on our phone....He told us to give him a minute while he went to check on something. He came back and said \"sorry but we don't have a button for that. We used to have that option on the order screen, but it's not on there any longer.\" My partner and I just looked at each other....in disbelief. No button for that....isn't that something you would hear a 16 year old kid at Mcdonald's say? My partner was so aggravated with the situation he wanted to leave but I was starving and I needed to eat. I ordered he did not. Daniel did nothing to help the situation. The answer to this all was \" We don't have a button for that!\" Him being the manager, he could have sold us the dinner that TGIF was promoting on it's site and rang it up however he needed to. We own our own business and realize the importance of making sure a customer doesn't leave with an unhappy experience. This didn't see to bother Daniel at all. TGIF might want to look into retraining some of their staff. Especially, in the wake of poor sales and closing stores.",

The last two times I've been in recently I can tell things have changed. I've sat at the bar both times and the bartenders are friendly. Both times I ordered the Cajun pasta without shrimp and it's so yummy, I came back within a week probably and had it twice because it was so yummy I had to get it again lol. The Barbados rum punch, while obviously not how they make it in Jamaica is very good. It's not very strong, nice and fruity which is how I like it. I'm glad the my sister pulled me in here one late nigh, because I had sworn off returning. My only complaint is that it's always freezing in there and for that I wish they had outdoor seating.",

Every time it's something different.  Sometimes it's the service. But usually it's the food.  It either takes too long, causes illness, or is just plain wrong.  Tonight we had a wonderful waitress,  but ended up waiting almost a full hour after our steaks came out completely undercooked.  Mine came back the second time just fine but my husband's was still raw in the center. So they cooked a new one. On top of that, they had no beer on tap, due to a cooler problem and the one bottled beer we wanted they were out of.  I mean, what are the odds?  Three separate managers came to apologize,  but when we got the check, it was clear they weren't really sorry.  I didn't ask for a discount but they really should have given one.  Word to the wise...there isn't anything on their menu worth $21. Most especially their 10 oz. Ribeye.  Just pathetic.  Hopefully we won't forget again ...I really couldn't justify ever going back here.",

We were seated in the bar area and waited about 10 minutes before a server, who also was the bar person to come by. He apologized for the wait as he was quite busy. We noticed and he agreed he had to serve food to diners at the bar, four tables in the bar area and also make drinks for the entire restaurant. We ordered salads, iced tea and a soda. A few minutes later our tea arrived but no lemon (as offered) and no sweetener.   Over the next twenty minutes, we observed more tables and bar stools filling up with people. The poor bartender was trying but was over whelmed. We saw an occasional other server dart in and out of the bar area as well as (we guess) the manager but not sure how much help was given. I heard the next table and a person at the bar complain about the service. We wondered why the host continued to seat people in the bar area when it was already poorly attended to by the staff.    After we were there almost 40 minutes, the bar person come over and said \"I'm really, really, sorry but I forgot to put in your order. I'll put it in now and put a rush on it\"and quickly ran off. We might have stayed but he ran off without even offering us a drink refill and giving us a chance to tell him the Coke was flat. At that time, another couple at the bar who had been waiting, was trying to flag down someone so that they could get served. The place was going from bad to worse so we walked over and told the bartender to cancel our order as we were leaving.",

The manager also explained the situation and my meal was on the House. The ribs were so hard that I've had bricks tender than that. Seriously! The waiter asked me if I wanted another rack of ribs but at the point I was totally disgusted and with no desire for ribs. I really wished I had a great meal as the other time I went there.

This is the first time I've been to TGI Friday's in a year or two, and I was coming here as a celebration with my cousin.  We walk in the door and see that it's not too busy, but the host is on the phone. We wait for about 5 minutes bedoee before being seated. We're immediately served drinks, which is nice.   I order the bacon wrapped shrimp (entree, not side!) And my cousin orders potstickers and a burger. They bring out our meals and I have a small plate with 6 pieces of bacon wrapped shrimp. For $15, this doesn't feel right. My cousin checks, and I was mistakenly given the side dish. We're told to keep it and that it will be taken off the bill. Okay, sure. I was asked if I'd like to order another meal, so I ordered a chicken and shrimp meal.  It was average, but nothing special. I get a smores shake for dessert and my cousin gets a brownie. The shake was overwhemingly sweet. I have a sweet tooth and I didn't even get through half.   We get our check and the shrimp is still on there for $10. What? We ask the waiter and he says he asked his manager and he wouldnt take it off. We call the manager over, and of course he takes it off, providing us with a few coupons.   I applaud that, but the fact is that it's a day later and I've got some kind of food poisoning that hasn't gone away.",

    "text": "As I write this, I am nursing an Alka Seltzer and hoping this feeling of horrifying nausea goes away.  Let's start at the beginning:  We rolled up to Fridays a little after 2:00 yesterday.  There was NO ONE in the restaurant, save one couple and their child.  That should have been our first warning.  But, figuring the lunch rush had just ended, we sat down anyway.  BIG MISTAKE!  They took our drink orders, got drinks out to us pretty promptly (considering the rest of the visit, but I digress) and took our orders.  I ordered the French onion soup, and it came out quick and piping hot, and not a bad bowl of soup if I do say so myself, if not on the salty side.  Here's where the nightmare begins.  We waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Around 3:10 we FINALLY got our food; and it's glacial.  And gross.  I had three bites of my chicken sandwich before I heard a sickening CRUNCH in the back of my mouth.  Pulled out the offending item; it was a ROCK.  There was a ROCK in my chicken sandwich!  I was polite, as my tooth wasn't cracked (thankfully) and I pointed the offending rock out to our server.  She took the rock away (hiding the evidence, I suppose) and offered to make me a new one.  The sandwich was nasty, so I just asked if she could take my meal off and that would be the end of it.  Or so I thought.  Three of my other eating companions soon declared that something was \"off\" about their sandwiches as well, and they couldn't eat past a couple of bites.  Well, with no manager in sight, there was no way to complain, and our server was a general no-show as well, so we just decided to pack it in.  Got the check; still had the soup on it.  We didn't get out of there until FOUR O'CLOCK because the server kept disappearing; we had stopped eating our fiasco of a meal at 3:20.  No manager ever came to check on me (as would happen at any DECENT restaurant) and I wound up having to take medicine for my sore jaw.  Hope there aren't any further effects from that stupid rock.  Cut to last night.  Everyone who had a sandwich was nauseous.  We were sick as dogs!  I've been downing seltzer suds like they're water to a man in the desert!  Woke up today to an automatic plop! plop! fizz! fizz!.  And I still feel like a punching bag.  NEVER AGAIN.  Am going to try to get our meal refunded by corporate; though with the news I've seen about this failing franchise, I don't fancy my chances.  EDIT:  We ate at this restaurant on Wednesday.  It's now Monday.  I am still sick.  Have to go to the doctor this week for the continuous nausea this food poisoning caused.  Neither the restaurant nor corporate are responding to our requests for a refund.  We now have to take this issue to the BBB; but sadly that won't pay our doctor's premium.  Seriously DO NOT go here!",

My fries were not fresh so I just ate my broccoli and shrimp til my new side and ribs came. By the time they did my husband was done with his meal. They further went on to tell me that they couldn't comp anything BC they made it over but the whole point in ordering the food was for it to come out all together CORRECTLY! The Manager finally came acting as if I ate everything and was trying to get a free meal smh out of all the places we could've spent our hard earned money I really wanted this place but never again. I see why I mostly cook at home because between the staff, incorrect food, manager and high ass 60$ bill I could've stayed home. Too bad I HAVE to rate one start to even post this because it doesn't even deserve that.",

First off-site our potato skins were burnt, and severally lacking. Harley any cheese, bacon, and no green onions. The ones you buy in a grocery store are actually better than what we had here.   Here's where it for really bad. I ordered their cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. It looked amazing, however the very first bite I must have apparently made an obvious fave because my husband instantly knew.  It honestly tasted like the ocean it was so fishy. I was really like eating shrimp in, an ocean sauce. I don't know if I can eat shrimp again for a long time it was honestly that bad. The waitress took it off the check but it was terrible.",

Shortly after receiving the 1 st order of apps I ended up with a medical emergency in which I passed out. Several customers came to my aid despite the manager being notified & being asked to call 911- in which she refused & told my friend to do it.  Thank you to those who assisted me  Shockingly we had to wait for our bill in which we were charged fully even though we only had 1 serving each of an appetizer. I needed to leave since I was not feeling well. Not that I was looking for a free meal but I felt it in poor taste since we didn't have much at all - the servings were really small  The fried pickles I ate were awful. I've never seen such a weird cut like this.",

    "text": "We used to visit TGIFridays a LOT, maybe once a week at one point.  Today was the worst experience here since we started to come here years ago.  Seated quickly, took me having to ask the host (after 15 minute wait at table) to find out who the server was supposed to be.  He then got us our drinks, not the server!  About 15 minutes later the server finally shows up, only to walk past us and start to take order from table that was seated 15 minutes after we were.  I made eye contact mouthing to her \"we were here first\", then she stopped and came over to us.  By the way, they should not seat people who reek of marijuana next to others.  She took our order, appetizer and 2 entrees.  We then waited about another 30 minutes before our entrees came out, note BEFORE the appetizer!  Half way thru our meal the appetizer shows up!  When entrees came out my wife's was wrong.  Tired of waiting so she ate what she could from it.  I asked for my sandwich's avocado slices on the side but when they were served, black and nasty!  Who would eat that!  No pride!  Then we waited another 15 minutes for the to go box and the bill.  On the bill was a charge for the wrong meal that my wife ordered.  Asked host for the manager and she apologized, took my wife's meal and the appetizer off the bill.  Needless to say the server got a small tip.  Lucky she got anything.  Also a note here, they were NOT busy, it was 2 in the afternoon.  No wait, plenty of tables.  I like TGIFridays as a whole, but this visit was so bad I had to write about it!!",

We looked through the menu and I decided to get the cajun chicken and shirmp pasta. My husband saw a picture of the bone bucket-it showed a full rack of ribs and wings and a side item. He decided to get that with a side of fries. My pasta was pretty good-not great. The shrimp was a little overcooked but the sauce itself was tasty. My husband got his bone bucket and was surprised that it only came with a half rack of ribs. He asked the server about it and she said yes \"The picture is misleading.\" She did admit that the picture showed a full rack of ribs but you only get a half rack of ribs. That is crazy! Why would they do that? It was obvious she's been asked that question before. My husband wasn't very impressed. The wings were good and saucy and the ribs were ok. The fries weren't hot and you didn't get a lot with it.   Overall, the food was ok. The service was great! I think our server was named Krystal but I could be wrong. I wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the area.",

Plot twist: he didn't order sweet potato fries. I did. My order was missing.   I ordered sweet potato fries in place of regular fries. We serving sweet potato fries like this?? Y'all I wish I can leave a good review but this...THIS!   Anyways my bf called the restaurant and they said to order it again and it's free of charge. Now another hour for my food. Who knows what will show up! Will update this post with my order.   I hope you guys can feel the hunger from this post.  Update: my food came and look you guys (it's the one with the two dry wings). Please do not even think to order this. I'm like...did they even try????? This a joke and I hope when they contact us, it's 100% refund. Freaking joke. I'm honestly laughing. Never again.",

It wasn't all that busy in the parking lot. I got there just after noon. I walked in and was immediately greeted. I got a booth.  I was charging my cell phone with my portable battery. My server came over, introduced himself, and asked if I wanted a beverage. I ordered a Diet Coke. He looked at my battery and loved that it was solar.  I ordered potstickers as a starter. I then went with the $14.99 special. You order two proteins, which come with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I choose the sirloin steak and bacon-wrapped shrimp.  The potstickers were okay. There was a distinct pork flavour, which made me ponder that the filling needed some help. In general, the potstickers are pretty consistent at Fridays.  My main lunch meal came. The steak was perfectly medium well for me. I loved the bacon. However, the shrimp seemed undercooked.  I was pretty full, so I didn't order any dessert. I got my bill fast.  The women's washroom was clean. No complaints here.  I liked being in a booth. I got to stretch my legs out. It was comfortable.  (116)",

    "text": "This was the first time we've been here in five years and now I remember why, although it's exponentially worse than it was then.   Hostess was friendly, helpful, and smiling.   That was basically the highlight of the experience.   Our server appeared to hate life; if not life itself then the five of us living creatures that were seated in her section.   We ordered a glass of wine, a Bloody Mary, a specialty drink of some sort, and three waters. We got one water and eventually the bar drinks. The drinks were tasty so I'll give them that.   It took FOREVER for her to get around to taking our order. We had our five year old and eleven month old in tow, so going out to eat anywhere is often a challenge and we try to be cognizant of other diners and have our order ready and have some games / distractions available to keep them occupied while the meal is being prepared.   I should have brought an iPad, some balloons, some sparklers, and a coffee pot  (to stay awake) because after 20 minutes when our order finally got taken, it took another 20 for the first two dishes to come out (overcooked hamburger sliders that would make a hockey puck look appetizing) and French onion soup.   I ordered a French dip sandwich. It had enough onions on it to ward off every vampire and human with a functioning nose in a fifty mile radius.   My husband got a fried chicken sandwich that he enjoyed. Both our meals were delivered ten minutes after the soup and kid cow patties arrived.  The roast beef was cold and you literally had to soak the bread in the au jus to soften it enough not to break a molar.   My advice to you, stay away unless you're wanting to go to the bar and drink.  That was the best thing about our lunch.",

I think the service was Great, from the hostess with the extremely low cut shirt on (i'm not a jerk, it was very low, too low for her, and too low for my liking, she had horrific stretch marks all over her breasts, keep those things covered!), to the waitress, who's attitude was friendly. Both girls were very nice, especially the one with the low cut top on, which made up for the fact that I had to witness all of her \"Goodies\". I couldn't help but stare! The food was plentiful, but it wasn't good. The \"fall off the bone\" ribs weren't falling off the bone and they were badly burnt! I'm giving them 3 stars due to the service, service was a five, food was a Zero!",

Apparently our section was being taken care of by a new server and she was not quite with the program as the waitress who ended up asking us if we had been waited on said. At any rate we ordered our food and were offered a free dessert per the manager who sent apologies with our waitress. I got the Jack Daniel's burger and it was really, really good. Cooked perfectly and served with pretty decent fries, I was a happy girl. My husband ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken with parmesan fries and broccoli and two huge chicken breasts (saved one for next day lunch). We did choose the brownie for dessert and it was good as well, and a nice offering to smooth over the rough start to service we had. It was a decent overall visit, but based on the experience as a whole, I think three stars is as high as I can go.",
