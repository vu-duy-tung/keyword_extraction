We had a very simple order of pizza and salads and we were in the restaurant for 2 hours and 15 minutes. The restaurant was not busy at all. The manager and assistant manager kept coming to our table asking if everything was ok, and we told them no... on numerous occasions. We waited 40 minutes before bread was delivered to the table.  When our meal was finally delivered to the table, it took another 35 minutes before we received our checks- which were all incorrect. It took another 15 minutes before they finally got them right. The manager came and offered us a \"comped\" dessert which only 2 people out of 6 wanted. There was nothing else offered to a very unhappy group of ladies. We told the manager on the way out how unhappy we were and she just stood there, saying she was sorry.  We will NEVER go here again and we will tell all of our friends to never go here either. VERY UNHAPPY GROUP.",

    "text": "This is a new restaurant in Ballantyne, which replaced an almost identical eatery.  On the positive side, my husband's calamari was most pleasing as was the wine my daughter chose.   I had a caesar salad which at best was \"run-of-the-mill.\" I requested Cavatelli Carbonara.  I was told to fold in the pasta, as the egg needed stirring from the bottom.  Although I have never heard of doing this, I complied.  The pasta, sauce and pancetta had no distinctive flavors or texture.  It was a blend of muck. I always say, the quality of the bread that a restaurant serves usually is a good predictor of the palatableness of the rest of the meal.  The bread was tasteless and boring.   My daughter ordered a very simple individual pizza.  When it arrived, the waiter asked if she wanted shaved truffles on top.  Here is where we made a BIG mistake.  She answered, \"yes,\" without asking the price of that extra topping.  When I recieved the bill, that single serve, mundane pizza was $37.00...unbelievable.  The server should have been upfront with that information. And speaking of waiters...Our waiter was overlyfriendly and condescending.   The previous restaurant was just as bad, with a similar menu, which makes me wonder if this restaurant wasn't opened under a different name...both not worth the calories or price.",

    "text": "This was our first time at the restaurant and unfortunately, it's not a place we plan to return to. First of all, when the hostess seated us, she said she was \"pretty sure\" our server was a certain person. She didn't say it in an endearing, I'm so excited and nervous manner, but in a \"I really don't care who it is\" manner. For a Friday night, it was pretty sparse and there were too many staff members walking around, uncomfortably so, looking for tasks to occupy them. One young server (not our own) after seen walking around aimlessly for half of our meal, stopped abruptly to ask us if we needed needed parmesan cheese grated on top of our dishes? Plus, there was an overall \"newness\" about the procedure- I had literally just finished my last bite of salad and three seconds later, my plate is whisked away.  Our server, who was extremely well-mannered and attentive, smelled of cigarette smoke each time he visited our table. I have no concerns about this except when it comes to a person serving my food.  The food was actually the highlight of the evening. We started by splitting the calamari and Caesar salad. The calamari was nicely battered and fried and the spicy tomato sauce it was served with was delicious. Not groundbreaking but well-done. The Caesar salad was flavorful- again, not groundbreaking but well-done. For our entrees, I had the eggplant lasagna, which was delicious. My husband had the cavatelli carbonara, which was the best dish of our meal. For dessert, we had bread pudding and I ordered a glass of Bailey's. The bread pudding was fine, but not particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the pour on the Bailey's was the equivalent of about two sips, but cost $9.",

On the positive side, the decor is really beautiful. Second, the staff is really good. Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and responsive. On the negative side, the food was average at best. Pizza crust was soggy on the bottom, way too much sauce and the crust tastes like salt water. The black spaghetti was saved by the tasty shrimp and olives. The pasta was bitter and sticky.  The pasta carbonara was inedible. It appeared to have been finished first and then put under a heat lamp which created a brown sticky top to the dish. The 'bacon' was a strip of uncooked meat. The sauce was so thick and flavorless I could not eat more than 2 bites. All three employees who came to our table ignored that I had not eaten anything.  My decision not to say any. I do like that they have smaller portions at reasonable prices.  Now for the interesting part. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant. There are TVs in the bar. Our table and the large table beside us were watching the end of the Georgia Alabama game. No one was being loud or disruptive however the server from the large table decided to come to our table and stand between us and the tv as we were paying our check. It was deliberate, unprofessional and petty. He had no business at our table telling us about a wine dinner they might have. It was very obvious he wanted to block our view.  Suggestion to management - if we were bothering someone come tell us. We would apologize and stop.  Also if you don't want people to watch turn off the tv. I know you are not a sports bar and would never intentionally disrupt someone's evening.  Would have considered returning to try again but think I will pass for now. That server really made a bad impression on my me and left a bad taste for all of us.",

On top of all that, they had a bright light shining over the table. I felt like I was on display with a pathetic candle that was trying to set the mood that was obviously ridiculous with the bright can light over our table. It took us over 20 mins to get our drinks due to the bar being backed up, but other people that sat down after us got their drinks first, so not sure what that was all about. My husband and I split the Caesar salad which was really good. I got the penne bolognese and it was good as well. My husband got the Orecchiette pasta and it was very bland and he didn't care for it at all. Our total bill was $100 including tip. The cocktail drinks were way too overpriced. I don't think this will make it on the list to visit here again which is too bad since we just moved here and were looking for a new date night spot.",

My BF ordered mushroom risotto and it was bland and looked like slop. The bread was average and the wait for the food and the check was long and unacceptable. There are other decent Italian restaurants in the Charlotte area, try one of those, I do not recommend this place to traditional Italian.",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice now and both times the food and service were stellar. My most recent visit was two days ago when my husband and I stopped in for dinner before seeing a movie. Because we only had an hour until showtime, we ordered three appetizers and a salad to share as small plates, and without our asking, the restaurant split each plate and replated them beautifully as individual dishes. A small thing, perhaps, but it made for an elegant table and we felt very attended to. Two appetizers were the night's specials, cucumber melon soup that was cool and refreshing if a tad sweet, and truly delicious scallops with a balsamic reduction.  We also ordered my husband's favorite, tender meatballs, and an arugula and beet salad in lemon vinaigrette.  The entree specials sounded so good that I was sorry we were in too much of a hurry to try them. If our waiter, Justin, was disappointed in the size of our meal, he hid it and gave us excellent service.   This is our new go-to place in Ballantyne.",

Trout cooked perfectly and a generous portion. Braised short rib ravioli delicious. . .but for that price, only TWO??? They never officially opened and owner/chef did say they were \"testing the market\". OK, I have a background there, and my advice would be to rethink their pricing. They also need to add some \"specials\", have a featured \"signature dish\" and a \"half-price wine night\". Think the restaurant needs to market itself. You wouldn't know it was there if you didn't frequent Ballantyne Village. Really do hope Zinicola can \"get it together\", Ballantyne Village really needs to get a better mix of restaurants.",

    "text": "First off, to the reviewer that was disappointed by the lack of \"Italian American choices\", this place bills itself as authentic Italian. Disclaimer to those looking for Italian-American, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for made-from-scratch authentic Italian food then you have just found a gem. I dated a guy in high school for 4 years with a mom that immigrated to the US when she was in her late teens, learned all her cooking from her mamma in Campo Basso Italy and was never influenced by American cooking due to that fact. This is the first time I have ever had food that rivaled the amazingness that lady used to whip out in her kitchen!  Second off, if you want amazing service with a personal touch and someone who will remember you by face (probably not name at first haha) then ask for Matt. I can't recommend a more down to earth, genuine and attentive server. He sets the bar high and knows so much about the menu.  My friend and I went here for dinner and drinks. We were so impressed and so stuffed. We still talk about needing to go back soon! Come prepared to spend some money in order to experience the menu and the wine/cocktail selection. The price point is very reasonable though for the atmosphere, service, taste and quality of the food and ingredients.   We started with the House Meatballs and the Roasted Octopus. The meatball is perfect and tender. The mixture of veal and beef tastes divine, cooked so that its juicy yet tender. The pecorino was fresh and the sauce was yummy. The octopus was at Matt's recommendation and I was apprehensive but gave it a shot. Wow- so amazing and also had a charred smoky taste. It was delicious.  Next, my friend had the Caesar salad and I had the Beet and Arugula salad. He was super satisfied with his salad and said it tasted like a real Caesar should. My salad was amazing as well, with fresh ingredients and a yummy lemon vinaigrette.   We then split two entrees- the Pappardelle Bolognese and the Short Rib. These were both also amazing. The pasta was out of this world and so clearly homemade. I know the description is kind of basic sounding but I assure you the taste is not. The Short Rib was so tender and yummy. I would highly recommend both.  Finally, for dessert we had vanilla filled cannolis. Delish!  I had a few cocktails and the manager sent us two glasses amazing red wine on the house that paired perfectly with our food. It was a very nice gesture.   Basically, check this place out! Service food and ambiance are all on point.",

    "text": "I recently made reservations here on a Friday at 8:30. As a resident of Ballantyne, I was thoroughly excited to try something so close and right in line with what I was looking for, for the evening. We arrived promptly to an amazing atmosphere, the place is definitely set up for great conversations with an open floor plan with a view from the bar of the kitchen. We originally accepted the offer of the bar table but due to it being a tight squeeze opted for the private dining in the back.   The private dining only had one other group and was fairly quiet. We ordered the waitresses recommendation of the tuna crudo and a bottle of Cab, can't recall the name though. I ordered a short rib ravioli and my date ordered the rack of lamb. The service itself was great throughout the night, it then got awkward towards the end.   10:30 rolled around and I asked the waiter what time they closed out of respect. He said 11:30pm but sometimes the bar will stay open a bit later. We asked him if we needed to move but he said we were just fine back there.   I noticed that hours online said midnight for a Friday night but figured I'd ask just to make sure. 11:00pm rolled around and the music was turned off on us. Sure, we didn't immediately order anything else but was in deep convo and enjoying the ambience. After spending $150 in dinner I'd think you'd have the option to do just that. I live in Ballantyne and get that things close earlier hence why I asked.   With the awkward silence and the closing duties getting started we opted to just leave and head over to Duckworth's. Sure we were way overdressed for Duckworth's but it beat the feeling of being rushed out of a restaurant. We ordered a bottle and dessert there and continued our night.   When you have someone ask when you close, just be honest. The facade that we are welcomed to hangout then begin pushing us out just put a bad twist on what would have been a fabolous dining experience. Had a e appeared to be older, I'm sure there would have been a different scenario. All in all, a thumbs up for the pretentious, but I'll personally just dine elsewhere.",

She did an excellent job with the recommendations (mushroom risotto and black fettuccini). I'm not sure how clearly it is marked on the menu, but the pasta dishes come in two sizes, my husband upgraded to the larger black fettuccini, which was a great move because the portion was much more appropriate for his size... And they did not cheap out with the portion of mussels and clams. I had the mushroom risotto, which was divine.... Simply delicious. I definitely recommend it. We finished off the meal with a perfect Panna Cotta, not too sweet.. just perfect.  I would come back  *** Update 3/23/18 *** .... I came back. It's so good, like really good. I got the mushroom risotto, again (it's just that good.) My husband got the Bolognese, which was good, the pasta was a little overcooked, but it was still delicious. The octopus was super tender, and the Panna Cotta was still perfect.",

    "text": "So let me preface this with saying that I gave this restaurant a 5 Star because I believe in what they are trying to do,  however they need to make some changes or others will start giving 3 and 4 stars.  First the Food,  AMAZING!,  really why I believe in them.  They need to be offering this food to the public,  again why I gave the 5 stars.  Second the Service,  lackluster.  The staff needs more experience and more support of either bus people or runners for food.  The positive is they have great attitudes and I can overlook the inability to carry off what really needs to be present for the cost of the menu.    Generally, I think they need a stronger Manager with a more definite vision of service,  seems like their focus is food, and it shows;  but service is as important to showcase the experience.  My family went to a breakfast joint the next morning and my 12, 14, and 16 years old commented that the service was better than the night before.  I highly recommend Zinicola, but am trying to reach out to the owners to get their service act together,  I truly do believe in them.",

I went to Zinicola with my parents after spending the summer in New York, and it was better than 95% of what I ate in New York. Our server, Noir, was warm and friendly, and gave us excellent suggestions for food. We started with the tuna crudo, meatballs and grilled octopus. The tuna and meatballs were good, but the grilled octopus was outstanding -- I mean ruin-octopus-for-life good, I'm worried that I'll never eat octopus that tender again. We were all very impressed by the starters.   For dinner we had the chicken, pappardelle bolognese and rigatoni. I can't speak for the rigatoni, but the chicken and pappardelle were outstanding. While Noir offered us dessert, we were all too full to partake. I'll happily go back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

It was flaky, firm, but moist and incredibly tasty. But the general consensus was that everyone's food was exactly what we wanted.

We had the octopus appetizer, and it definitely was one of the best I have ever had.  Delicious, and inventive.  Done just right.  We shared a pasta and the risotto, which were excellent.  The risotto was cooked just like the way we had it in Italy last year, and I loved it!  Very friendly and accomodating.  Very responsive service.  Really enjoyed it and will be going back again soon.    Nice to have a really good Italian place in the hood.",

    "text": "Very sadly disappointed by our entire experience here. We had high hopes as we love Italian and actually had our wedding reception in this same space when it was a different restaurant. To say we were let down is an understatement.   To start, my husband and I ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. It took about 20 minutes of waiting for the server to say they were out of the wine I ordered. By the time I got the replacement our appetizer arrived before our drinks and they brought the wrong cocktail to my husband which has zero ice in it.   The food was not good. Cesar salad tasted only of anchovy and I like anchovy but this was really fishy! My husband ordered the black fettuccine. It was so overly salted it was inedible. However after waiting an extremely long time on our food to arrive he didn't want to send it back in fear it would take just as long to get something else. My spaghetti was lackluster and did not taste homemade as the menu described.   All night the servers kept apologizing for the slow or chaotic service. Hey, how about don't apologize just give us good service? When we told our waiter about my husbands overly salted pasta he only offered a dessert. We were so turned off and waited so long for our food we didn't want to stay for dessert. He didn't offer a manager to come speak to us or any other concession or accommodation.   The whole experience was just a let down. We really enjoy our date night and when you have this sort of experience it put a damper on the evening. We will not go back.",

The menu is limited, this would be okay if the food was prepared well and unique. Sadly it is not.  3. The menu must be explained by the staff. On the entree section, the bottom 3 items are full entrees, the remainder are half entrees but the menu does not explain this, the staff must explain this tableside.  The staff should never be required to explain caveats to your menu. Spend a few dollars and change your menu. Geez.  4. The food.  I was taken back to a time long ago with my entree. I had the PASTICCIO AL FORNO...... it truly did take me back to a forgotten time. A time when I was first married and my wife and I were struggling.  Why did it remind me of those long lost days? Because it tasted EXACTLY like Cheesy Lasagna Hamburger Helper, not somewhat like it.... EXACTLY like it.  My wife had the Seafood Rigatoni..... it was just a basic red sauce with a few, very few pieces of seafood mixed in.  Want Italian? Go to Riccos off 51.  Want to waste $70 on dinner go here.",

    "text": "Very nice restaurant and I think has a good menu.  A little too much sea food for my wife, but she is OK with Zinicola.  They have opened up the interior so there is plenty of space in the main dining room and enough away from the bar to avoid a crush.  There is even an outside bar, which should work out well for them as you do not have to be restaurant customers to have a beverage.  Tables are out there and if you are in the Ballantyne Village shopping center, you are in.  The back of the restaurant is a party room and they did have quite a crowd there that evening.  Also there are two other separate rooms up front and to the right as you come in.  Sterile and isolated, you will get a good feel for what Purgatory is like after you pass on.  Be good so you can be seated in the main arena.  For a start, we ordered meatballs as an appetizer.  $12.  When it arrived I thought it was over prices at $4/meatball for a total of three.  That said, they truly were delicious.  At $10 they would be reasonable.  Prices are up there.  $32 for bronzino, which I had.  Nice portion, excellently cooked and on a bed of veggies.  Next time I will ask for a potato cake bed, which would be better for the juices and go better with that fish.    Wife keeps on the quest for the perfect eggplant parmigiana.  Current champion for her taste is in Waxhaw at Antonio's.  Zinicola offers an eggplant lasagna that missed the mark.  According to wife, \"It is tasteless mush.\"  I tasted and agree.  No body, not much flavor and is really is mushy.  $14.  Nice selection of wines by the glass, all around $10 and you receive a decent pour.  Bottles are, of course, available.  It is a full bar so you can have a cocktail, 86'ed by my wife, so I can't tell how good of a mixologist is at the bar.  Next time, maybe.  Service was pretty good.  Greyson was let down by a slow bar whose bar tender was paying way too much attention to the ladies clustered around the hostess stand, but a little pointing encouragement from me moved Greyson along.  He did come through with service and follow up.  Worth while.  Make a reservation.  Parking is in the main open area and there is the big parking garage if you get skunked out of the close-in spaces.",

Realized for the first time just how truly big and spacious this restaurant is...so many tables! It was a slow night, but I wondered if they're able to fill up the place on weekends?  Anyway, I decided to try their Sausage & Broccoli Rabe Pizza for dinner...and think I made a good choice! The pizza was very, very thin (which I like!) and the sauce was fairly light as well, with delicious toppings. I definately recommend trying this perfectly light and savory pie!  Can't believe it took a year for me to revisit...but glad that I did!",

Everything started off good but towards the end our server disappeared and we had to flag someone else down to order after dinner drinks and get the bill. Overall, this is a great place to get Italian and we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "My parents were in town visiting for a long weekend and we wanted to go out for a nice dinner for their last night here. Living in Ballantyne we have driven by Zinicola many many times we figured we'd give it a go as we did see it had some pretty good reviews.   To start our meals my husband and I split the Arugula and Beet salad while my mom had a speciality Pear Salad. Both salads had beautiful presentations and were very refreshing.   For our main courses I ordered the Mushroom Risotto, my mom had the Mussels, my dad had the Lamb Shank and my husband had the Cavatelli Carbonara.   My husband and I both really enjoyed both of our meals, but my parents on the other hand had some serious issues with their meals. The first issue we encountered was my mom's mussels, they were super salty. If you are used to eating mussels you would know they should never be salty. My mom addressed the issue with the server and he insisted on making her new ones so he did. He asked the rest of us how we were enjoying our meals and my dad mentioned how fatty his Lamb was. Our sever didn't even acknowledge what he had said. While he was serving our food he was slamming the plates on our table and honestly would not stop talking to us. He brought back the new mussels for my mom, while the flavor was fine they didn't seem to be fresh.   Zinicola prides themselves on their fresh homemade pasta which is think they have absolutely nailed, I just think they need to work on perfecting other parts of their menu.",

It was only us until it's time for us to leave.   I ordered the bolognese which is pasta with beef and veal. They asked if we wanted dinner portion or regular portion. I said regular portion which is perfect. At first, I'm like omg I'll be hungry and will order more but it's the perfect size. Full and content but not overstuffed. My love for creme brulee also having me ordered the berries creme. But i didn't much care for it. Texture is too soft but good. And complete with a nice cup of coffee.   I'm surprised that this place is not packed. But wondering if it's because it's a Monday night. Cassandra was wonderful. Consistently check on us but not overbearing.. all and all. This place is one of my favorite for a date night!",

    "text": "This was our mother's day destination restaurant.   It was sure close to my Mother's house, even within walking distance I had been seeing this restaurant and wanted to try it. They accepted my OPEN TABLE reservation, which was a good thing. The outside entranceway makes the restaurant appear small and rather unremarkable, but one step inside is all you need to figure out it's impressive and grand in scope.  The atmosphere is upscale.  I was wearing shorts and a tee shirt and although I didn't feel out of place, this restaurant probably deserved better from me.  Our server was a dapper, younger gent who was very fluent with all of the dishes. He strutted around with swagger and seemed in control. Unfortunately his accuracy did not match his peacock persona.  After he brought me tea, I had to ask him THREE times for lemon and some Sweet and Low. I was about ready to give up.  I ordered an arugula salad that was supposed to have goat cheese. I asked for parmesan instead.  The salad was served with no cheese.  He didn't check on us during the time we were eating our salads, so I just let it go. The salad, by the way, was very decent. I really enjoyed the cubed beets on the plate with the arugula.  For my main dish, I had the chicken.  It had a butternut squash puree on on the plate and a few small carrots. The presentation was very fru fru. Good, but not outstanding.  Same with the service and that is why I am giving this a three star rating.  If I were rating just the atmosphere, I would give it five stars!  But then again, I am more of a hole in the wall kinda guy who values taste and simplicity over style and presentation.  By the way, my mother loved the place, and that is what mattered the most tonight!",

    "text": "Fantastic!! This place really made you feel like you were visiting in Italy! Not as much from the atmosphere, it was really a modern style restaurant that I don't picture in old world Italy, but definitely in how they treated their guests! Everyone was family.  I visited with my coworkers on a Wednesday evening. We had a party of 17 that trickled in over a period of about an hour. We all started outside with Eric at the bar. Talk about great service!! He was a star for all of us. Kept glasses full, shared refreshing drink recipes for the summer heat and handled our group with professionalism and humor. Just how we like it! Once everyone arrived and had sufficient time to share a cold one, we went inside to begin the dinner service. We did require a shift in the table set up but nothing a few minutes and musical chairs didn't fix. After that, appetizers and drinks were ordered and promptly delivered. I think we tried almost every appetizer and I didn't hear anyone complain. I quite enjoyed the fried calamari. It was crisp, light and a good assortment of tentacles and bodies. Bread was also brought out for us to enjoy.  I asked our server for his suggestion of a pasta entree. He said that the pappardelle bolognese is one of the most popular dishes along with the pasticcio al forno. His favorite was the pasticcio al forno but I quite enjoy the fresh pappardelle noodle so I chose that instead. After drinks, apps and bread, the portion of the pasta was perfect. Not too much and the sauce was seasoned very well. Some bolognese comes off very sweet or the meat mixture can be heavy but this was quite good. Not overpowering in any direction.  I'd definitely like to visit again with friends or family!",

    "text": "Went to Zinicola twice in the past two weeks. The first time we went, just about everything was delicious! The second time we went, it was like there was a different chef - everything was just way too salty. My grandfather ended up putting water in his pasta to try and take away some of the saltiness (LOL). The staff was nice enough to remake the dish without the sauce but even then, the pasta was so salty (thinking someone put too much salt in the dough that day). Not sure if we'll be back due to the inconsistency! The two dishes that do shine at Zinicola are the octopus appetizer and their delicious tiramisu - could eat plates of that!",

    "text": "Was here for a charity event. Did not sit down and dine here. Impressed with the ambiance of the Zinicola.   Event was just passed the entrance. In fact right across from the front entrance was were the event was held. Nice room. There were a variety of appetizers laid out on the table. The Arancini stood out the most. What did they put in that rice ball? Not to mention the Calamari and other appetizers. Just a couple of these were a meal itself. Crispy and so tasty even without the sauce on the side.   Atmosphere was classy and staff was attentive to all attendees at the event. There was an audio issue and staff came to the rescue.   Will definitely be back for dinner in the near future.",

    "text": "Eric at the bar was a delight, he navigated me through the menu and gave me recommendations.  I had just left the salon and wanted to grab something before heading home and this spot caught my eye so had to check yelp before heading over and I'm a sucker for house-made pasta so Zinicola it was. With the help of Eric, I ordered the Margherita pizza and Bolognese to go.  I was able to watch my pizza being made and cooked as I sat at the bar, pretty cool but I was disappointed that the pizza had way too much sauce on it, way too much and I couldn't really enjoy it.  I was able to enjoy the Bolognese with homemade pappardelle, it wasn't the best and was a small portion for the price, but it was good.  I may return to try some of the other recommendations I was given, but I would like to see that sanitation grade get a little higher before then.",

Service was uneven. For the manager: tell staff to not interrupt diners who are obviously in a deep conversation and definitely do not drop the bill and then not come back for it.",

The wine selection was good and my dinner- beet salad with arugula and black linguine with mussels - was excellent.  But the chocolate panna cota for dessert was especially memorable.
