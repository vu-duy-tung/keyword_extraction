I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it tasted homemade and there was a perfect amount of cheese.  The ziti with pink sauce was oh so creamy.  The garlic knots...wow.  So very tasty.  And the zeppole were light, sweet, and addictive.  I can't wait to go back and dine at the restaurant - if my experience meets my expectations, they will definitely get a 5!",

Have to say he was not entirely correct....they have great pizza, subs, salads....nice spot, tight on seating as it is a popular place so be patient.  Friendly staff and ownership.  Fresh bread subs that they toast, enjoyed a sausage parm sub and my son ordered a pizza.  Both very good and came out pretty quickly considering a whole sub.  Will go back again!",

I ordered stuffed shells and my husband ordered chicken parmigiana. My meal came with a garden salad and I got Italian dressing to go with it. The dressing was delicious and the rolls that came with our meals were right out of the oven, large, soft and very yummy! My stuffed shells were very good and I really liked the sauce because it had a sweetness to it. My husband enjoyed his entree as well. After dinner I noticed they had a chocolate loving spoon cake as a dessert. I had never had spoon cake before but this was AMAZING! If you LOVE chocolate this is a must try!!! The staff was very polite, personable and on the ball as well. Please check out Giacomo's the next time you are craving Italian, you won't be dissapointed!!!",

    "text": "Saw the reviews on Yelp and thought I would try it out. Our waiter was either new or not very bright as he didn't describe certain items on the menu and/or didn't know answers to questions about the menu. I ordered the chicken Parmesan which apparently comes with either noodles OR salad, but not both. I guess it's my fault for not reading the fine print, but every restaurant that I have ever ordered Chicken Parmesan from has noodles automatically included. Who would want just the chicken and a salad? The waiter also failed to mention this specifics of this meal. My girlfriend ordered spaghetti and meatballs and received two whole meatballs! When I went to pay I asked the cashier about the chicken Parmesan not coming with noodles. Her reply was \"it's always been like that\". So I guess everyone that eats there has been there before, it's not possible for someone to go there for a first time. The food did fast good, butt everything else I just described ruined the experience and I definitely won't ever go back.",

Fast forward to my 3rd day passing this Italian gem.  I finally broke down and called in a to go order for me and my boyfriend to have an easy night in.  I ordered two orders of the Stromboli and a Greek salad. If you've never had a Stromboli it is similar to a calzone but stuffed with mozzarella and Italian meats.  This one had pepperoni and Italian sausage.  I got home and warmed it up in the microwave for thirty seconds and sat down to dig in.  I dipped my bite into the side of marinara sauce it comes with and a second later I was eating the BEST Stromboli I had ever had.  The crust was perfection, the mozzarella was fresh and melted amazingly, the meats were flavorful and the sauce was so tasty it almost made me cry that something this delicious was only $6.50!  Not to mention it was HUGE! I am not proud of this but I inhaled the whole thing that night.  :)  A few days later I called in a lunch order and had the chicken parm sub..... Again, amazing.  Huge portion and delicious.  I must say I have gone back twice more for the Stromboli, as I am a huge fan now and after this assignment ends I will be heading back.!",

    "text": "Well, having gone to a really great real NY style pizza joint on a recent trip to St. Simons Island, GA, I was craving some good pizza back home in Charlotte. I looked up what was near me on my tripadvisor app on my iPhone, and saw this place, which had gotten decent reviews. I thought, what the heck. Well, we started with the bruschetta and some wings as an appetizer. The bruschetta sure didn't seem like an authentic one, judging by the tomatoes, dried basil leaves, and shredded mozzarella, but tasted decent. Wings were okay, a little on the greasy side, but the taste was fine, and I like that they were baked. But, the pizza, supposedly the hallmark of this particular place? Blah. Sauce barely there, and not sweet tomato taste. Crust was nice. I got pepperoni and mushrooms, and yes, as listed on another review, these were your standard canned mushrooms, nothing about our pizza said, \"Hey, this is an authentic, fresh Italian inspired pizza!\" My wife and I rattled off about a dozen places better than this, heck, my wife even said Papa Johns.  Service was sparse, but friendly. We are still looking for the best in Charlotte to eat some wings and good pizza. Oh, well.",

    "text": "Came here for a slightly early dinner on Saturday night while in the area for a convention. Hubby and I were in the mood for non-chain food. This place did not disappoint! Hubby got the special, which was manicotti, lasagna, and chicken Parmesan all on one large plate. He ate most of it and then sat there grinning and complaining that he was too full, but it was worth it.  I had the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. The chef was kind enough to put the sauce in a separate bowl for me since tomatoes are a migraine trigger for me. The chicken was nice and thin, well flavored, not dry, and not salty. It was good!  We also had a chocolate cake for dessert. It was okay. The fudge frosting and chocolate moose layers were good, but the cake parts were a bit dry. (We still ate most of it)  Our server was friendly and attentive. Service was fast. One odd note: the check was handwritten. That's fine if it works, but a bit odd, even for a small business in this day and age.  I would go back here when we are in town next and recommend this place to anyone who asks!",

The bread came out super warm and was very delicious and both of our pasta entrees were excellent. For $15 before the tip, you can't beat this. Definitely will be back!",

The menu is huge and has a good variety of authentic Italian food. I usually go for either the baked manicotti with spinach or baked ziti with ricotta. And the desserts a great too; I would definitely recommend the cannolis. The decor is minimal but it works for the restaurant. It gives it a nice, laid back feeling. You'll regularly see the owner or is wife working in the restuarant. It's great to know that the owners are involved and care about their place.

The pizza is great.  The crust isn't bland, and it's nice and thin.  I usually ask them to make mine well done, and they do.  The only thing keeping me from giving them that 5th star is the mushrooms.  They used canned shrooms and advertise it as so in the menu.  Let me tell you, fresh mushrooms would just set off some of their dishes.  I don't mind the canned kind, but I personally prefer fresh.  With that being said, the staff has always been wonderful, the service has never been bad, and the prices are AMAZING!  I definitely recommend anyone looking for a great little pizza joint that has a nice, relaxing atmosphere.",

It was basically the lettuce mixture that comes in a bag with a 1/4 of a tomato wedge and 1 slice of cucumber  (this small salad) bit it was still good. The bread is a very good crusty roll.

Their alfredo sauce is made to order, every time. And it's really tasty, especially with a little bit of salt-and-pepper added.  The garlic and cheese bread appetizer as well as most of the hot sandwiches have an overload of garlic, but in the best way possible.  The eggplant parmesan sub, add grilled onions and light on cheese (which is still a ton), is really amazing.  For a healthier option, try the antipasto salad.

We were greeted and seated immediately, though, and a nice rotation of staff were very attentive.  It seems the stock in trade of this place is solid food in enormous portions. We began with the bruschetta which was very tasty, though served on toasted Italian rolls which made too much bread for my taste. I just ate around it, though. Next came a slice of lasagne that could have easily fed 2 people, and probably 3, and a special spaghetti arrabiata with chick that was good for 2. Honestly I we go back we will split an entree. To finish the tiramisu was recommended. It too was good, though not great. It did not have enough layers of lady fingers for my taste.   All in all a good meal, and a good place to go especially if you are really hungry.",

Yes, she said and took my order. I get there and they said actually they can't do it... Funny because you just said you could over the phone and told me the price. Now I have to wait another 15 minutes.   I had to order a whole pizza and do half in half instead of getting 2 slices! Rip off. No discounts or anything to make up for the mistake or miscommunication. Instead I ended up spending double.   Shake my head. You need to work on your customer service if you want to keep customers.",

Pizza was better than other places we have tried in Charlotte.  Ordered calamari- it was tasty. There's not many foods that are deep fried that do not taste good.  Ordered pesto sauce- the only thing we didn't like, and could not eat. We left the entire bowl there (which we were still charged for).  The pesto sauce is not classic pesto. You know, basil, pine nuts, olive oil. They added cream or alfredo sauce to it. I have never had alfredo based pesto. They need to let customers know that their pesto is different than the standard.  Our server was Brooke. She was nice.",

The menu is quite large offering everything from a full pizza selection to pasta, veal, chicken and classic Italian favorites. The brick oven pizza is quite delish, but I don't think you can order just a slice of pizza.  Last time I grabbed a quick bit to eat I ordered the Alfredo pasta. The sauce was definitely homemade and very filling. I ate to my delight and had plenty to take home!  The decor is a step up from other pizza joints in the university area, so it's worth a stop by for lunch or dinner! The garlic knots are a good start to your meal.",

They were just ok. Maybe the pasta is where it is? Love supporting small family businesses.",

I'm talking about many things here:  the rolls you get as a side with dinner plates, the garlic knots that scream out to me from the menu, and even the crust on their pizzas.  The first impression you get when walking in is how friendly the staff are.  Even with takeout, they make sure everything is \"right\".  I'm a man with 4 kids, so when I order out from this place that means a LOT of food is coming back with me.  These fine folks always scrounge up a nice box to hold all the dishes.    And the dishes, they are plenty good.  I'm not going to claim that they're the best Italian place ever, that would be silly.  What they are is one of the best pizzerias in Charlotte, especially with regards to value and consistently good food.",

I order the other stuff as filler because the Garlic Knots are pretty darn delicious!   This place is pretty cheap but you really get what you pay for.  It isn't the greatest italian that I've ever had but it's good not great.  Also, what you should do is do that Charlotte Half Off thing if you can.

    "text": "Three of us went to this restaurant on Saturday night, January 2.  Keep in mind that this review is based on a very busy Saturday night.  The restaurant was crowded and we were told that there was a 20 minute wait for 3 people to be seated.  We waited for over 30 minutes and were finally seated.  We ordered a medium pizza, a greek salad, and 1 entree.  The greek salad was delicious, made with fresh ingredients.   We shared the salad and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Definitely recommend it!   They provide fresh, warm, home made rolls that were excellent as well.  However, the pizza (which we were looking forward to eating and was our main reason for going) was not so good, not worth the wait.  The pizza dough was not cooked through (soft/mushy on the top part) and the sauce had absolutely no flavor.  We think they rushed the pizza out of the oven since they were so crowded.  Maybe they rushed making the sauce as well and left out or ran out of ingredients for it.  I would give their pizza 2 stars.  The entree that was ordered by 1 person in our party was a penne dish.  They said that it was tasty and that they would order it again.  The waiter was very pleasant, but kept forgetting the items we asked for, e.g., more water, grated cheese, extra napkins, and a refill of soda.   Basically, I think, not sure,  that we may give this place 1 more try for the pizza.   We will not go back on a busy weekend night though.  If it's bad again, I know that we will NEVER go back.",

I read reviews about \"in the mood for NY Style\" pizza which didn't see billed anywhere on any signs or the menu. What I read was pizza. I was a little miffed reading it. Isn't NY Style just really a bunch of Italian immigrants who landed in NY and made pizza, so I don't know what these people were talking about anyway because the owner (Sal) grew up in Naples.  I had the pizza and it was good. Not greasy cheap cheese cardboard pizza, but thin crusted pizzas just like the Italians in Boston's North End where I spent my childhood. So maybe I'm bias to real Italians making real pizza. It was loaded with pepperoni and they were flavorful. The sauce was on the sweet side and the pieces slices were good size. They cost a whole 1.95 well worth the money. My family had several of the other dishes and they were good also with a variety of sauce. Most places use the same style sauce in every dish but these were seasoned according the billing of the sauce. I read in another review that they use all frozen stuff which I can believe as do most all smaller everyday restaurants and all chains. This isn't fine dining. I rated it very good as a place and gave it the extra to excellent to counter act the poor from the no taste bud and disgruntle ex-employee reviews!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g49022-d1208434-r257600932-Giacomo_s_Pizzeria-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html&s=06848e8afdbe4743bee7c6b07a64da1c59f739a4b4097073658bceb2ef04e581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

There was supposed to be eggplant on top and it was dark brown and thinner than a piece of paper. You would never guess it was eggplant. The side of penne with their red sauce was a cheaper tasting pasta and the sauce was thinner than tomato soup with absolutely no herbs or seasoning. Again, tasted like someone poured a can of off bran tomato puree over the pasta. I'm Italian and cook mostly Italian Foods. This restaurant wouldn't last a week in New York.",

Service was fast and friendly.   I started with the caprese, because that's what I do. Good size and came with a balsamic dressing (not the traditional oil and balsamic vinegar) but was still good. I wasn't a fan of the mozzarella though. Almost too dry, like it wasn't fresh, but instead came from a package. That wasn't a good sign. But then out came the garlic knots. These, my friends, are not like garlic knots I've ever had - they are huge, like the size of your fist!  I'm glad we only ordered the 6 piece. They were soft and seasoned well.   The kid had the spaghetti and meat sauce off the kids menu. He loved it and said it had the perfect amount of sauce (not swimming in sauce like some places make it). The sauce had plenty of meat as well. We ordered an extra cheese pizza and it was phenomenal!  We're always in search of the perfect NY style pizza, and this was the best one we've had in a long time!  It was dripping in cheese with the perfect amount of flavorful sauce, and yet the crust was not soggy at all!  If this place was in our neighborhood, it would definitely be our go to pizza place!  We'll most certainly return when we're in the Charlotte/Concord area again.",

Anyways, we have ordered multiple large pies from here with various toppings and we have not been disappointed with what we have received. Toppings are fresh, and well cooked into the cheese, not still half way raw or cold....actually baked into the ooey gooey cheese and oh so delicious. Very reasonably price for good, as close as it gets authentic NY pizza. Also, definitely order the cannoli!",

I'm picky yet basic when it comes to my pizzas. I always opt for the pepperoni and sliced Italian sausage. The difference between Giacomo's and other places lies in the execution. The pepperoni and sausage are always sliced perfectly. Never too thick or too thin. The sauce is delicious but never overpowering or in excess. The amount of cheese is just right. The pie is always piping hot and made to order from start to finish which takes an extra minute or two but so worth it. I've never eaten in because their seating is a bit limited but that's never been my plan anyway.   Their slices make great next day leftovers and hold up to freezer storage well. I just put them in the toaster   oven and they are as good as the day they were initially baked.   Great place.",

    "text": "I was somewhat disappointed with this place. I was really looking for a good place for pasta and after reading reviews I thought I had found it. I wanted to try something new so thought I would give this place a shot.   The reason I give 2 out of 5 is because service was real fast and our waiter was attentive always checking in on us to see if we were \"good.\" So this rating is based on only the food.  The only thing we enjoyed were our appitizeiers which were the Garlic Knots and cheese fries. Garlic Knots were huge and delicious. There cheese fries were also tasty and good portion size.  So I ordered the Linguini Shrimp scampi which was good in portion size and included a side saldad. BUT it had no flavor whatsoever I found it to be very bland. The discripton said something about garlic and lemon and I did not taste neither. I wanna say it was $13.95  My husband ordered the Seafood Fra Diavolo. He was expecting it to be spicy and it was not spicy at all he said he thought the sauce was watered down and had no flavor whatsoever so I tried some and yup no flavor, it also came with a side saldad $15.95  I ordered the kids spegetti for my daughter's and the sauce itself was tasty and came with the huge meatball. But the meatball seemed to not have been cooked right it was real soft and tasted weird. $5.95 each   I'm not sure if it was an off night or they are just known for their pizza & garlic knots because I didn't see any reviews about the dishes we ordered. I also noticed that everyone was ordering pizza and they seemed to be satisfied. So with that said I would like to go back and try their pizza and give an update because their pizza did look really good.",

We were immediately greeted when we walked in, and the hostess/waitress sat us within a minute.  The menu is very overwhelming because it is 3 LONG pages of food with prices. They had 3 Thursday specials on a chalkboard in front of the hostess area. Since the menu was so overwhelming and the specials seemed like a good price, I ordered the Italian Trio. The Italian Trio consists portions of chicken parmesan, lasagna, and baked manicotti. The special also comes with lovely sized salad and two rolls of ciabatta bread. All of that for $11.95! I also ordered a fried cheese appetizer (4 cheese sticks), which was $6.25.  After about a 5-10 minute wait, the salad and bread came out. The rolls were steaming hot and the salad (Caesar dressing) tasted fresh! Our fried cheese appetizer also arrived. Holy moly...those cheese sticks were delicious. The marinara sauce that came with it tasted amazing. I'm assuming it is homemade.   Finally, the Italian Trio came out. First thought? That is a lot of cheese. That is way too much for me. I'm already full from my salad and bread. The baked manicotti was the best part of the dish. The chicken parm comes in 2nd place and the lasagna came in 3rd (however, I'm not a lasagna person).  Food was amazing. Service was excellent. Sandra was very kind & answered all my questions. She was very sweet. I will definitely come back again if I'm ever in the area.  I was with a friend and our total bill was $32.26 (2x Italian Trio & 1 order fried cheese). Definitely worth it!",

A friend and I stopped by spur of the moment on a Saturday evening to enjoy some pizza. Normally I wouldn't have chosen this place, but a fellow NYer I ran into months ago said she only gets pizza from here so I made a mental note.  We ordered a pizza with extra cheese and the shrimp and scallop alfredo pasta. My friend was shocked by the big portion. We knew beforehand we would split it, but it was a nice amount. If you try to split alfredo from chain restaurants between two adults, someone will be left hungry. The alfredo ingredients were fresh, and it was absolutely delicious.   The pizza was very good, pretty close to home except that the crust was a wee bit too hard for my liking. I still ate as much as I could without dwelling on that fact.  The hostess and servers were friendly and efficient. I will most certainly return.",

Our bill was twenty dollars for Italian. You can't beat that.  Their garlic knots are huge and filling. The marinara is house made and chunky. It's a little sweet, but delicious. Their garlic knots have butter and actual chunks of minced garlic.  The chicken parm is legit. It was 7.75 and it was actually better than some chicken parms I've had at the North End in Boston. The North End would easily charge $18 -$24 dollars for the same dish. The chicken is fresh and flat. It has a little crunch and is mosit. What else can you say?  Giacommo's is a total recommend. It's fresh Italian food without the price tag of most places. Also, it's obviously delicious!  P.S. - The pizza is pretty good too.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to trying this place because the food looks so great in the pictures but left kind of disappointed because of the subpar service and al dente pasta. Ordered the Italian Trio to get a taste of their three most popular dishes the Manicotti, Lasagna, and Chicken Parm. The chicken is your average cutlet, the ricotta was good in the manicotti, and the lasagna was delicious minus parts of it being partially soft and the other part very firm to almost not cooked.  The dish was a steal for only $12.95. The major downside here is that the service of the staff here needs a complete overhaul because it's bad. When we arrived it took over 5 minutes for someone to greet us and get a table even though the place was filled with employees that walked past us numerous times. Once we were seated it took 20+ minutes for someone to take our order because it wasn't told to the waitress she was assigned to our table which is forgivable. However it went beyond forgivable when a waitress and waiter in the same section stared and walked by us for the whole 20+ minutes. Lol I would probably still be sitting there until close without service if I didn't call over the waitress that walked by us for 20 minutes. Once we got a waitress she was very nice and knowledgeable about the good and the bad on the menu. The pizza here looks really really good but the letdown here is that they won't allow you to order just a slice if you are dining in but only by take out. If this place gets its staff in order and cooks the pasta all the way this could be 5 star restaurant. I'm going to give it another try to test out the pizza but it'll definitely be for takeout.",

    "text": "I was looking for chicken picatta and was headed to a different restaurant that I found on yelp. As I was driving I stumbled upon Giacomo's and decided to stop there instead of the initial restaurant destination. It is located in a small strip mall type of shopping center. Parking was available. There was seating outside that I noticed being occupied by a group who seemed to be really enjoying their food.   I was excited and felt that I had found a new place for Chicken Picatta. Being that I had literally just gotten back from NY and had an opportunity to try NY pizza I was interested in trying their pizza as well.  The staff were friendly and professional in greeting us immediately upon entering the restaurant. The menu provided plenty of options however chicken piccata was not on the menu. The server said he could definitely make chicken picatta since they already offer a veal picatta using chicken instead.  There were so many other items that I wanted to try but decided to stick with the chicken picatta. My daughter ordered the chicken parmigiana and we shared a slice of sausage and cheese pizza.   First the pizza came out smelling and looking delicious. We both agreed that the pizza was delicious and a winner for future dining option. Then came the chicken picatta and parmigiana. The chicken parmigiana was decent no real complaints or compliments to add. The dish we've all been waiting for disappointing to say the least. There was a weird gelatin like lemon gravy. The texture was not to my liking and the taste was overshadowed by the gelatin gravy. I attempted to eat it but was not very pleased. I immediately regretted my decision to stop there for this reason. The visit wasn't a total loss because of the delicious pizza. I would definitely stop in again but it would strictly be for pizza.   I would recommend that they rethink the gelatin gravy like substance for the chicken picatta. If it weren't for the pizza and the great customer service I would have given them 1 .",

    "text": "Hidden Gem!  I was really surprised by the quality and size of their plates. Went here for dinner on a friday night. No wait, though we were seated in a booth by the entry. The snowstorm just passed a few days ago, but the air was still frigid. Hostess tried to seat us more inside, but everyone was crammed there already. props for trying!  Coming from NY, i'm really surprised how not many or any places in Charlotte have vestibules for temperature control. Perhaps it's due to climate change (YES, IT'S REAL) that Charlotte has experienced this type of weather, but wouldn't businesses want to save money on air-conditioning when patrons open the doors constantly? Just a thought and my only criticism of this place - even a temporary plastic vestibule would due the trick!  Now for the main part: FOOOOOOOOOOOD: As appetizers, we had the garlic knots and the fried calamari. WINNERS!  Those garlic knots are huge. We got the small order - 6 pieces. We were only 2 people and could barely finish 2 . Mainly because we got a huge plate of fried calamari. They serve them WITH the tentacles. Yum!   Main course: I had the veil parmesan with the spaghetti. WOW. Two veil cutlets. HUGE ones. I could barely eat 1 and slightly touched the spaghetti. Tasted fresh and the marinara sauce tastes homestyle. Spaghetti was aldente. Not too soft, not too hard.   The BF had the mushroom ravioli. His plate was piping hot, the ravioli were good - they give you lots! The mushrooms were a good touch, not too overwhelming.   Staff was attentive and friendly. Our server had lots of suggestions and was super sweet.  We will definitely come back here.",

Next time I want an \"authentic\" italian meal, I'll boil up some spaghetti at home and open a kar of ragu, because it'll taste better and be bwtter quality than what you get at this place. I had the chicken parmesan. My chicken was limp and lifeless, soggy and flavorless. It had rougly the same texture as a particularly hearty piece of cardboard. I'm 90% sure it was frozen. The sauce was very sweet,  and had that sort of tinny tang that comes from canned sauces.   My dining companion got the ravioli with meat sauce her meal was also substandard. She said the raviolis taste like the frozen ones we buy from Walmart.   The dinner rolls also tasted frozen.   I can't talk much about the service, our waitress was a lovely young woman who promptly informed us it was her first night on the job. And while she had to be reminded to bring out our sides, nobody should be judged too harshly on their first day.",

For main course, we had an order of the fettuccine with scallops and shrimp. A large portion, very creamy alfredo sauce and a few good-sized shrimps in there. Excellent flavor and more than enough for two. The pasta was especially fresh and tasted handmade.  I also decided to get a meatball sub because meatballs. Tasty fresh roll with big meatballs and lots of red sauce. Good stuff, but next time, I would add cheese.  One other thing to add was that the salad on the side was mostly meh but I will say that the cucumber in there was super crisp. Nice!",

We have been frequenting this restaurant for over 6 years- and have referred SO MANY people to come here.  This is now my 3rd review of this restaurant, and if you notice, my first 2 were 5 stars- because they have THE BEST food.  The service is seriously now terrible!!!  Not sure what ha happened lately- but our last two visits, both in the past 6 weeks- have been horrendous.  Today we were seated (without menus by the way...but we knew what we were getting so I wasn't that worried...) but then no one came to us!  I looked at my phone to look to see how long it had been...and it has been 13 minutes.  We watched a server go up to the table next to us multiple times- took drink orders, food orders, delivered their appetizers... and never even looked at us.  My husband finally told the host that no one had helped us- and then no one STILL came over!  We got up to leave and that's when someone finally came over.  It was the same server who we had on our last visit- when the SAME exact thing happened.  Waited forever... and she remembered us- she said \"this always happens to you and you come when it's busy.\"  It was around 7:30pm tonight (Sunday) for reference.  I believe it was a Saturday night last time.    The only one that seemed to care was the server- i don't know her name but she often wears a bandana in her hair and is very sweet.    Anyways, super sad that this is out of our rotation...some of the BEST food but the service is just terrible lately.  You can never even order the food, if no one comes over!   So disappointing.  had to update my review (still 5 stars!) because it has been so long- and it is still 5 stars!!!  It's breakfast time but I'm pretty sure I could still eat Giacomos...  Hidden gem, hole in the wall, down home family Italian...call it what you will, but call it delicious!  So many menu options, but the chicken parmigiana is my absolute favorite, followed by lasagna.  Pizza is amazing too!  I should also mention that their pizza put me into labor- you pregnant ladies may want to head there close to your due date, haha!  And the rolls....yummmm.  Still hate their salad dressing though- if they had a homemade oil/vinegar type Italian or balsamic I'd say it's the ultimate...but they don't.  Makes me sad, but i can't count them out for salad- but it would really enhance my meal!  You'd never notice this place in its quaint Check it out (but on a different night than me so it's not so busy)",

It's not vodka sauce, it's better. Get it. You won't be disappointed.   The rolls are worth the crabs and the extra cardio! They're soft and a perfect compliment to the must have pink sauce.   The mild wings had a decent amount of spice, enough for me not to need to try the hot. Served with range or blue cheese, no celery...but who really enjoys celery anyway?   The portion of food is insane! I was able to eat three different times from my leftovers!   The staff is great, too. They know the menu, and I always get the feeling the employees enjoy working here.

Now, Charlotte has some great pizza spots, but little Giacomo's tops the heap. They also have the best cheese sticks. I don't know what they do, but the fry and flavor are great. I have also had their sandwiches. Once again. . . Great!  If you find yourself in the northern area of Charlotte, slide on over to this little pizzeria.",

It's about 1/4 mile or less off the I-85 in the University area.  They have a full menu with nightly specials.  The restaurant is small so If you want to come and sit down for dinner I suggest you come early as theres always a wait on the weekend.  My favorite dish is the chicken parmigiana.  Oh and the warm bread you get when you get there are really good.   Cheers!",

The server I had was basically absent I seen the other server often but mine was no where in site. I even got up and paid at the counter and saw my server sitting at a table facing the other way playing with her phone she never did see me. The 5 stars are for the food only at that alone is why I will be going back,but when I do I will ask for a different person. Don't let the service of this one person keep you away the food is spectacular at a great price",

The service is pretty mediocre nothing to ring home about but not trouble either.  The lunch prices are reasonable and the food is good. The pizza is probably the best thing I have had here. Then I would say the lasagna, which is a very huge portion so you will have dinner as well. The tortellini paste is good I got both mushrooms and chicken but I think I could have went without the chicken, it was kind of dry. This is definitely a great Italian little spot that's not too pricey and you get your monies worth.",

We got the lobster ravioli which was delicious, the house combination pizza very good (up there with NY pizza!) And the linguini with clams and white wine sauce. All very tasty. The lobster taste fresh and may be a too dish for me...the clams may be from a can (not sure) but I highly enjoyed them. The 12 inch pizza they say is a personal pizza but if you are not super hungry I think it's enough for two people especially with an appetizer... we got the 14 inch pizza for two people and did not come close to finishing it (that's a good problem). My parents come here weekly... This was me and my husbands first trip...so glad we could try it out...I appreciate that they even know my parents by face !! That's good service! I recommend!",

The \"manager \"said he would resolve this now and get our wings with their fresh oil.  How can this happen?? Oil takes a long time to heat.  We then had to sit for another 12 minutes waiting on our order. To make matters worse, the wings are totally from the old oil and they didnt even give us a discount.

They offer an appetizer called Garlic Knots with homemade marinara sauce that's pretty good. You're able to order pizza by the slice before 4PM and customize it n e way you like...I like to add fresh garlic to mine. The staff are always friendly and the place is neat and clean.

When he gave us the check,  he didn't ask if we needed anything else, and he did not thank us for coming.

Been going there for 5 years now and that is over. $13 for chicken parm that is mostly sauce and cheese...very little pasta...not worth it. They smother it with cheap and unhealthy cheese. Tomato sauce here is TOO SWEET! Jar sauce is better.  Increased prices on salads which are CHEAP iceburg lettuce only and black olives...1 peice of cucumber and 1 peice of  diced cheap pink tomato. For $5 I would expect mixed greens and real veggies. Nobody wants cheap and unhealthy iceburg lettuce. You are the ONLY place who uses it. It has no flavor..Asked for 1 extra roll and did not get it. Spent $21 for 1 person and couldnt get one extra roll. I highly recommend NOT wasting your money here. Its sad that so many consider this authentic Italian. Charlotte has akways been weak on the italian side. Growing up in a real Italian family I can tell you its not.",

I was ravenous and had a hankerin' (this is NC after all) for Italian food and knew that my kids would be happy with passable pizza. First off, the place, which is small, was packed and had a thirty minute wait, which in itself is a good sign.  Once we finally were seated, there was a delay of a few minutes before we met our server. Thankfully, she brought some fresh, hot bread which more than made up for the delay. Delicious rolls work wonders on the hungry soul! I had the special which included chicken parm and lasagna, and i found it to be quite nice indeed.  Overall, the food was fine, neither delicious nor bad, and it hit the spot for that moment in time, hence the three star rating.",

In fact, each time we have been there, we have been served by the same person. Juan greets us with a smile, and starts us out with our usual drinks.  For appetizers, the garlic knots have been the only thing I have tried. They always come out hot and fresh.  The chicken parmigiana plate is my go to. It is always delicious!

The young lady who answered was not only polite, she offered to take a reservation for a party of six. When we arrived our table was ready and the service was so nice. A respite from the Concord Mills \"mall experience\"! My sister and niece had driven up from Columbia, SC to meet us on our visit to Charlotte. We had garlic rolls, salads and entrees for six. The bill was only $74!!!! The food was fresh, made to order, and HUGE portions. Might suggest splitting entrees for mid sized appetites.
