    "text": "My wife has hashimotos thyroiditis along with borderline celiac disease, which means that she cannot consume any gluten, grains if any type, dairy, or nightshades. Needless to say going out to eat can be very challenging but there are options as long as the kitchen and wait staff is corporative. When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess. My wife asked for a gluten-free menu to start. The menu said they used gluten-free buns, but my wife also can't have any grains including rice flour whichch is a common ingredient in some gluten-free breads. She asked the hostess if she could ask the kitchen what ingredients are in the bread. We watched as the cook in the kitchen yelled at the hostess saying that \"nobody's ever complained about our gluten free bread before so I'm sure the lady (my wife) will be just fine!\" That's when the hostess embarrassingly repeated what the cook told her. My wife then heard the cook yelling at her for the whole restaurant to hear, hat she shouldn't have any troubles with the bread. My wife then tried to gently explain that she needed to know the ingredients because she has to be sure that there are not other allergens in the bread as well because she had more than just a gluten allergy. The cook then loudly yelled at my wife in front of everybody which was humiliating! The other patrons were shocked that this cook was doing this. We left immediately because I knew that if I stayed any longer I was going to beat the s*** out of that guy in front of everyone. It took everything I had to not go back to teach that guy a lesson. I called the manager and told her what happened and she said that she heard about it already. She said she was going to do something about it but I know she didn't because I recently heard from a friend who said that same guy is still working in the kitchen.   Needless to say, I will NEVER go back there again. There are other choices who have employees who are at least a little sympathetic towards those with food allergies. I understand that perhaps the cook was having a bad day, but that doesn't give him the right to yell at someone just because he made a bad career choice.",

We were full by the time the Monte Cristo arrived but we sampled the sandwich and it was very tasty as well. We packed up 80% of the sandwich and 30% of the chips for the road.

The food was great each time.  Our Grandson was with us the 3rd time & he couldn't finish the food.  I have never seen this before.  Portions are huge. My favorite breakfast item is Johns sandwich.  Service is great& servers are always very friendly & checking in often.  Metro will be one of our go to places.  So many things we want to try on the menu.",

I had a taste for chicken and waffles, so I did a quick search to find a place that would serve it at dinnertime and came across this place. I was very pleased with my experience here! I didn't think to take a picture of my plate before I started eating, but I was very satisfied with what I received. I was a little hesitant about the sweet and spicy syrup and strawberry butter combination that they served with the waffles, but I was pleasantly surprised. The helping of chicken is huge: a breast, a wing, a thigh, and a leg. I ended up taking three of the pieces home because I got pretty full off of the waffle alone. The service was very friendly and pretty fast considering how busy they were. I'll definitely visit again in the near future!",

My friend got the pot roast....he said he felt like they played it safe....but it was still good.  My other friend got a basic breakfast.... he was OK with his too.  Cost:  Pricing was all over the board.   More expensive than typical diners....but the large portions justify it.....I guess.    Service:  Seems to always be on a wait...but I believe thats because its new.   Our server was full of personality, very efficient, and was just great  Atmosphere:   not a very warm feeling environment...kinda basic .... with an old skool throw back kinda feel.   Location: Easy to find, lots of parking, lots of places to wait.  Would I go there again?  Yes.   Is it the best in town...not quite yet...... but its not bad.  My only MAJOR SUGGESTION -   Later evening hours....till at least 10 or 11.   You are losing business by closing at 8.  There are very few places in Charlotte that are open to eat past 9 PM.  That is frustrating.   Later evening hours would be a HUGE plus!",

    "text": "Brunch. Let's talk about it. Lets talk about Metro diner.   I pull right up to the front of the building. I say building, but it's really the edge of one of the buildings in the Matthews festival shopping center. The one opposite the Harris teeter.  I digress.   There are a few families milling about outside of the entrance. Judging by the jam packed outdoor seating area, they must be waiting for tables. Any place that has a wait at 10:15 on a Sunday , let's just say that's a good sign. However I also don't see a single person in the outside seating area or among the about millers that looks like me.   Some of my people abide by the rule that if you don't see us at a restaurant, then the  restaurant must not be all that good. I don't agree with that per se, but I distinctly remember thinking, \"hmm. I might be the lone brother in here.\" I took a moment to prep myself for that possibility.   My worries were immediately abated when, upon entry, I was greeted by 2 bright eyed young ladies, one of whom looked like me, and was invited to seat myself at the bar next to another lady who looked like me.  If you've never eaten at the bar in a diner, what is your life? There are few More interesting and enjoyable foodie experiences than watching 15 people operate a short order kitchen during a heavy food time. You've got 8-10 short order cooks, limbs and pans flying away. 2 kitchen managers are yelling out orders in that secret diner code. You order a Benedict Florentine? No my brother, that's a Vinnie. You've got a floor manager somehow keeping every order straight and calling out for runners, and these runners! They appear seemingly from the aether ready to get that Vinnie to your table, along with about 17 other orders, somehow not dropping a single plate.   It's like watching that hallway scene from Daredevil season 1, except you get waffles instead of adrenaline.   Everyone there was super friendly even amidst all the chaos of the brunch rush. I, being me, bugged the floor manager About different delectables as they would come out. I learned about corned beef and potato hash. I learned about strawberry butter (STRAWBERRY BUTTER!). Then something glorious happened.   I saw my order as it came out.   I have to tell you about the eggs. They have mastered the art of short order eggs. First, the scrambled eggs were dreamsicle yellow. They looked fluffy and creamy, the way I've only seen the Gordon Ramsay's of the world get them to come out. The omelettes (I got one) (more on that later) were like little pockets of sunshine. So yellow, with just the faintest hint of Brown when you get up close to them. The closest thing to it was the omelette I saw Jacque Pepin make on his tv show about 15 years back.   Ok. So lets talk about my omelette. It came out wrong. I ordered an American omelette with added asparagus (you can get asparagus in an omelette, and that's what life is supposed to be). The American is thinly sliced ribeye, mushrooms, onions and cheese. I got 1/3 of the way through my omelette, when I got the oddest notion.   You see this was one of the 2 or 3 best omelettes I've ever eaten. In all of life. It's easily the best from a technique stand point. The omelette was solid on the outside (remember the whole vaguest suggestion of brown thing?) But the center. It was like custard and souflee had formed a holy union in the middle of this omelette, and I was the only one invited to the reception. It's a testament to how good of an omelette they make that it took me a third of one too realize:  my steak omelette was missing the steak.   I asked about it, hoping to get some steak on the side, so I could finish the omelette as God intended. NOPE. What wound up happening was so much cooler.   First the shift manager, or GM - a young brother with a headset and veto powers (more on that later) - came up and had a short convo with me about how an American is supposed to be. \"Steak is supposed to be falling out the side of the omelette from the first bite!\" He said, or something to that effect. He then orders me up another American with added asparagus \"on the fly\". Cool right? I get to have the full American experience plus, I still have my fruit and bacon, which was now Former bacon. I ate all the bacon is what I'm saying.   I wait with my fruit cup, munching away on strawberries, continuing to marvel at the efficiency of the kitchen staff/ floor staff synergy. Another miracle happens.   I get not only the full American, steak literally falling out the sides, but my FULL FRICKIN ORDER again! Double fruit. Double bacon.   Now the veto powers. I get the first order comped. SOP, right?  GM sees my check, picks it up, and puts down another check. I look at it. Other than my coffee, he comps the entire meal. That's service above and beyond the call of duty.   Oh, yeah: I recommend and will be back in 2 weeks for those waffles.",

I got the flavored coffee of the day and my mom got the regular stuff...we checked out the daily specials board and decided to split the Key Lime Pie stuffed waffle and then took a while longer to find something \"not sweet\" as our other item to split (2 egg breakfast to the rescue). Eggs were a perfect over easy, hash browns were crispy, bacon was done just the way I like it (biscuit was a little dry)...the stuffed waffle??? An entire Belgian waffle with an entire slice of key lime pie (with the crust), waffle then folded on top of the pie and then covered in a glorious raspberry sauce! Omg...such good food and the service was excellent, the kitchen was moving like a well oiled machine! Will definitely be back for more!!!",

We went on a week night around 6 and this place was packed! We were told there was a 30-45 minute wait. Lots of people already waiting outside... We were offered the bar for immediate seating so that's what we chose.   The restaurant was loud. Especially sitting at the bar since the staff yell back and forth at each other. It was fun to watch them cook however.   I got a salad with grilled chicken. Nothing special. All of their salads were typical everyday salads....nothing to return for.   My mom got the roast-she said it was very good. Fell apart with a fork. However it was supposed to come with veggies and it looked like she got the bottom of the container.   My dad got the chicken pot pie-looked good. He said it was tasty but the biscuit topping was tough.   Overall we might come back but not our new go to spot.   Wait staff was nice. Looked a little frantic-maybe they are still getting the swing of things?",

    "text": "We're big fans of the Pineville location so we were thrilled to see one opening closer to where we live and lucky enough to get an invite to the soft opening today.  Honestly can't say enough good things about this place, everything is wonderful, the food, the service, the restaurant itself.  Today we met Julie - the managing partner of this location - and she and her staff really seem to have it together.    The food: (I'll upload some photos!) - I had the Yo Hala on the Square.  Delicious item I was really hesitant to try in the past, but it was amazingly tasty (and huge!).  Hubby had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits, also fabulous - I had a bite, definitely the best either of us has ever had.  Teen daughter enjoyed the pound cake French toast (it's her *usual* from the many trips to the Pineville location), teen boy ordered the grilled three cheese with bacon and tomato, and then after he finished his, he finished my Yo Hala and his little sister's chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese and his Dad's shrimp and grits (he'll outgrow this phase, right??) - and his opinion was that it was all wonderful.  If I had a complaint (I really don't!) it'd be that having a location here in Matthews really isn't encouraging me to cook at home more.  Not at all!  Full opening is Tuesday, counting the minutes - and I'm going back to *my* usual - because as much as I enjoyed the Yo Hala, NOTHING compares to their fried chicken and waffles (with strawberry butter to die for... SO GOOD!). Trust me, this is the place you want to go, breakfast, lunch AND dinner.  ****** Update:  back again yesterday and now (sadly) I've had to go gluten-free for health reasons.  Never fear - they have a great GF menu and were able to get me some seriously tasty eats!  I had the breakfast pie (I'll upload a photo) - eggs, mushrooms, peppers, cheese.. all kinds of yum and the fresh fruit on the side was wonderful despite the upcharge.  Hubby had the Monte Cristo (photo of that too!) because he has no gluten issues and he also was thrilled.  Definitely will be back (likely before next week lol!)",

We saw Rachel socializing with the staff for a while as we waited for her to return to our table with to go boxes & to retrieve our payment.  This was our first time and unfortunately will not return, not worth the overpriced food and poor service. We will drive out of our way to continue to patronize our favorite diner on Central Avenue (Landmark Diner) where the food is amazing, prices are better the portions are larger and the service is outstanding.",

Poor customer service and bad attitude is what she gave us.  The food wasn't even as good today.  So the manager came over and we asked about the other waitress.  Apparently she's relocated.

The Huevos Rancheros was pretty good but I omit the egg or have it scrambled.  The fried jalapeno wasn't hot which was good.  The croissant French toast was tasty.  I had my first chicken n waffles tonight.  The strawberry butter sauce was a favorite for everyone.  The chicken was hot and crispy (not salty at all).  The andouille sausage in Charleston shrimp and grits brought out the flavor.  Otherwise it would have been quite bland.  The meatloaf was quite interesting as it consisted of many types of meats in one.  The vegetable mix and mash potatoes was a nice addition.  The Holy Devoli burger was stacked and perfect for a cheese lover.  This is a good restaurant as it has a variety of choices so patrons can come back to try something different every time and establish favorites.  The service was the upmost attentive, food was warm, good presentation.  I would expect everything to be the same as a patron.  I feel they were sincere regardless of the type of occasion.",

    "text": "I would give Metro Diner a 4-star review because I am generally a fan of the food there; however, there have been some problems with consistency recently. I don't know if management looks at the reviews and corrects issues, but there are some people working there that I can only assume don't care. On one recent experience as I was taking the utensils out of the paper bag, a wad of paper fell out. Then when I pulled the utensils out of the bag, there was a rather large piece of paper - likely napkin material (about 3/4\" x 1-1/2\") that was \"glued\" to the knife inside the bag. I assume that a human is putting the utensils in the bags after washing them, not a robot. If a human is stuffing the utensil bags, clearly the person doesn't care about what they are doing as the foreign material was very easy to see. My wife ordered breakfast and the toast was badly burned - completely black crust and flat sides. The hash browns are usually very good - nice and golden on the outside and just cooked through on the inside. On a prior visit they were overcooked to the point of being blackened on the outside and very hard all the way through. I doubt any of these incidents are up to the standards of Metro Diner, but it looks like no one is paying attention. It's hard to believe any restaurant would send such obviously burned food out of the kitchen.",

After waiting about an hour to be seated, we then waited another 40 minutes with about 50-100 other restaurant patrons who also had no food for our food to come out. I can put up with a lot in the pursuit of a good hungover Sunday breakfast; however, after being told that there were three managers working in the kitchen and not one of us got the right order, I was a bit confused to say the least. One of us had eggs that definitely had just come right out of a chicken in the kitchen. Another one of us got eggs that got extra cooked to make up for the lack of cooking in the other eggs. My potatoes were definitely chopped and plated raw. My fiancee got a wrap with sour cream...we're vegan. And my other friend got everything that she asked for to not be in her food in it. Were we comped for any of this? Nah. Like I said, it was an experience.",

The staff seem to have a willingness to provide service but lack structure and training. I walked in with my kids at 10.30 am and the hostess told us sit anywhere. A free for all, no menus, no guidance just pick a table! The problem was none of the tables were clean inside or outside on the patio. We sat at a dirty table and waited for about ten minutes until Chastity came and cleaned our table. She then got us menus and  proceeded to serve us, however you could see that she along with the rest of the staff were overwhelmed. She brought coffee but no creamer and then we had to wait for silverware. By that time my coffee was cold. The breakfast food is mediocre, nothing to write home about. I ordered eggs with sausage links and waffles for my kids. The eggs were rubbery and tough and the sausage links were deep fried. Is that a southern thing? The waffles were fine. The manager should have been on the  floor clearing tables today and meeting and greeting guests. Not a good start for a new restaurant.",

My wife had grits that were obviously real grits, not quick or instant. They were creamy and one of the best bowls of grits ever. Her scrambled eggs were fluffy and cooled to perfection. The gravy biscuits were also perfect. We can't say enough good things about the food or the generous porportions. What? Only 4 stars? Let's move on to the service. Our server was very nice and very sweet. Attentive? Not so much. Never noticed when drinks were low. Had to flag her down to get extra napkins because she wizzed by us every time. At check time (and we needed boxes) my wife got up to go find her. A little more effort on service and this is a 5 start all the way. We WILL be back and try more items from this epic menu that serves breakfast, lunch, & dinner all day.",

I have tried it at various locations but have never been blown away like I was this time around. The chicken is marinated for 24hr giving a fantastic savory and salty taste with great texture. The waffle was prepared well, but what took this platter to  another level was the strawberry butter. The mixture between the saltiness and crunch of the chicken, paired with the sweet and fluffy waffle, followed by the soft fresh butter created, a mouth full of orgasmic flavors and textures. I will definitely return and highly recommend to others. Furthermore, their portions are very friendly.",

I know my review doesn't have pictures of the menus, but feel free to look one up after this.   Have you ever gone out to breakfast and the bill was $40??  Sure.  Now picture how many people it took to get to $40.  Are you counting 4 or more?  Me too.  Our bill was $40....for 2 people. 1........2. $40.  No mimosas, no steak and eggs(which is $15.....why??) not even something extra to take home for a little later.  Each of us got a meal that costs at least $10.  (Eggs, bacon, and a side, why does that cost $10+???). Omelettes, $10.  A breakfast sandwich, $7.   This is ridiculous.  The only reason this review got three stars was that the food was good.   Not $40 good, but what you'd expect out of a chain restaurant.  I'll never go here again.  I'm sorry.  I'm sure the food is good, but I can go and get a breakfast sandwich half the cost anywhere.  And any True\"diner\" is more than half this price.  So to sum it up, if price doesn't matter, enjoy!",

Personally, I tried the Cajun chicken pasta and had a huge portion size. The pasta had some spice to it but not extremely hot and had excellent flavor. I look forward to my next visit!",

We have been there probably a dozen times or so and have always loved the food and service - but this time was bad  While delivering the food to the table, the waitress was guiding the 'deliverer' by saying one plate goes where.  For my wife's meal she said 'And that goes to the old lady'. She didn't say it loudly, but all three of my family members heard it.   Not that it makes any difference, but my wife is 52 and probably looks mid 40's at most (not a gray hair on her head).  Obviously my wife was quite upset (BUT STILL TIPPED).  The waitress was a young blonde female and is in the wrong line of work!",

    "text": "This diner was an unexpected surprise.   I went to get my car service early on a Saturday and wanted to grab some breakfast so of course I did a quick search and saw this place had some pretty good reviews. We arrived around 9:30AM and waited to be seated about 5 minutes before our table was ready.  The restaurant was already buzzing with the Saturday morning rush.   The waitress came to our table and took our drink orders. She came back twice and there was so many options on the menu I couldn't make up my mind. I finally settled on the Western Omelet, Cheese Grits, and a Biscuit. We waited for about 25 minutes for our food which I thought was a little long for breakfast but they were really busy and I had some time to burn so I wasn't that concerned. The waitress checked in with us and told us it would be ready soon.   When the omelet arrived, I thought I had too much in my omelet and wouldn't like it but man was I wrong. The omelet was delicious with nice chunks of ham. The cheese grits had cheese on the top and they were good...but then I realize there was also cheese on the bottom and by stirring them up a bit they were even better. Lastly, take my advice.... get the biscuit. The biscuit was freshly made and falling apart. I have seriously been craving this buttery, soft yet crunchy biscuit since I first taste it. I placed jelly on the biscuit and it was even better. I honestly could have just ordered a biscuit and been happy.   As we were leaving there were a lot more people waiting so I could tell we got there at a good time. If you are going on a Saturday morning perhaps get there before 10AM. I know they are building another location a little closer to me so I definitely will be visiting again.....for the biscuits of course.",

    "text": "Been here 3 times so far and this is my new goto spot on the weekends for breakfast/brunch.  The staff is friendly and accommodating, this is always appreciated.  We almost tried eating at a new place in the area this afternoon (where Fuddruckers used to be) until I read all the reviews regarding their service.  Makes me appreciate a place that has friendly people who have their system down pat.  On to the food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The Eggs Benedict is awesome and is something I could eat at any time of day.  Today I had the biscuits and gravy with 2 poached eggs on the side (which I pop on top of the biscuits).  It was very good.  The gravy is light and creamy, less salt that I prefer but I imagine its healthier than the gravy I make (with bacon grease and butter).  I like this restaurant because they have a good down-home dishes they do really well and many of their dishes have a higher end feel to them due to attention to detail and quality ingredients with a slight twist (good quality baguette/texas toast, fresh cut avocado, fried jalapeno slices, strawberry butter, homemade soups, etc).  They get all the little details right and that makes the food good.  They do all that right with the food yet the diner feel is cozy and casual and not some high-priced stuffy eclectic hipster joint.  We will be back.",

This location has a solid management team, the host was extremely helpful & friendly. Our server was accommodating, personable and super sweet!   My husband ordered the pot pie ...it was so DRY you could have used it as spackle. The server quickly took it back to the mgr. they jumped into action and had it remade. They thanked us for bringing it to their attention... she had the kitchen tweak the process and the second time around it was very tasty. I would recommend ordering it with extra sauce, live & learn. It was delicious!  The mgr. came by our table to inquire if it was moist ...we told her it was \"perfect.\" She admitted it was super dry, nothing like straight forward candor & handling things proactively. #TRUEprofessional    My broccoli cheddar soup was equally as tasty!   Highly recommend!",

I asked for the waffle to be a little crispy because I like a little crunch in it and they made it perfect! Served with butter and syrup. You can ask for a side of strawberry butter to put on top if you wanna try. If you do, it's a very sweet combo with the syrup FYI...the chicken biscuit sandwich was good too. I asked for a side of their spicy sauce instead of them pouring it over the chicken cuz I was afraid the biscuit would get soggy. Overall it was all good.",

I've never experienced such disrespect and lack of compassion at a restaurant until I ate here.  Response to owner: We did call and spoke to Julie. She said she was aware of what happened and was very apologetic to my husband. She invited us back in but we did not want to return after that incident. The cook not only yelled at me, he yelled at your hostess in front of everyone waiting to be seated. I would speak to them as well.  We did return another time, only to get my order wrong and get sick after eating at your restaurant...not to mention the two hour wait to get our food.

    "text": "So glad that Metro Diner opened up this second location in Charlotte.  It's much closer to us than the one in Pineville and occupies a space that I've always liked.    We've visited this Metro Diner several times for breakfast so far since they've opened (and brought several out-of-town guests here as well).  Obviously we've loved our breakfasts since we keep coming back.  It's nice to have an alternative to Stack's Kitchen in Matthews, which we also love, but is usually difficult to get a table for breakfast on weekends.    We've even eaten dinner at Metro Diner once on our most recent visit.  During this visit, we came by on a Saturday evening around 7:30 PM.  There was a line, so we decided to do some shopping beforehand and come back.  We got back around 8:30 and there was no line.  However, we noticed on the door that they closed at 9:00 PM.  Yikes!  Being a diner, I just assumed they were open later, like maybe 11 or 12.  We still went in because the place was super crowded, so it's not like we were the only ones there.  (Hint: maybe you should stay open later?)  We were quickly seated and greeted by our server Taylor.  She was super friendly and speedy.   My partner ordered the Western omelet (yes, breakfast (and even lunch and dinner) is served during all hours).  It was filled (and overflowing) with ingredients.  Since I've had their breakfast items several times, I wanted to try something different.  I opted for the Bold City Burger -- Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage (yes, both!), fried jalapenos, and garlic aioli.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  It was truly amazing -- juicy and flavorful.  I'd definitely order it again.  There are a lot of side options to pick from; I went with the sauteed veggies, which happened to be yellow squash and zucchini that evening.  They were a little charred, which is my favorite.  Another good choice.  I could have eaten even more of them.   Since opening, Metro Diner has been a great, new breakfast option for us.  Now they've become a dinner option as well.  Good food at a reasonable price.  Now if they can only stay open a bit longer...",

My coworker ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. My sandwich came with a tomato on it (which I dislike reg raw tomatoes) but it was easy to take off so I didn't complain. The hostess did see my face and me take it off and offered to just have them make me a new one because it's so fast to make but I assisted I was fine but thanked her. That was very nice and observant of her. The soup was a little too thick for my liking but the favor was really good. The pasta was hot and the cajun seasoning was just right.",

The sandwiches are really quite large and will satisfy even the biggest eaters. The fish sandwich was even larger than the Philly and I picked the mac and cheese as the side. The fish was perfectly cooked with lettuce, tomatoes and tartar sauce. The tartar sauce is a sweeter tartar sauce so keep that in mind but they do put the sauce on the side. The taste was amazing...no complaints!. The service was also excellent and we never asked for anything. When we left and walking to the car, I dropped my coffee. A waiter saw this happen and brought me a coffee outside! Great service! The cost isn't the cheapest but worth it. We paid $27.00 plus tip for the above.",

You can get breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime of the day.   My wife had the regular chicken pot pie which was still pretty big and there is a jumbo if you're really hungry.  It was fantastic.  Loaded with fillings and chicken if you like chicken pot pie it's a must try.   I had the pot roast which was also really good.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some vegetables. The pot roast was so tender I could cut it with a fork.   Pretty good service although our server kinda disappeared for a bit but no big deal. Everything that was coming from the kitchen looked really good and I can't wait to go back.",

They told me the hash browns are shredded potatoes the picture on the menu shows potatoes cut up. This is going to be a play by play review.   We'll see pictures wife's pot pie veggies not all the way cooked thru , my links were supposed to be well done they came almost uncooked.  I will go no further except to say they compensated my meal.   So they may be worth a second try in the future now that I know what to order.  Avery was very good a great server.   My wife and I said that my granddaughters food was the best.   She had gravy and biscuits.   They do have military discount don't care how much but proud to have one. Sorry picture of wife's was not in there.   All the people were great and friendly. Might try a diner someday.",

While sitting and waiting, I was able to observe the great team work and good service they provided, unlike the sister restaurant in Pineville.   Lunch was better than our breakfast experience in Pineville location.  My husband had the avocado wrap with grilled chicken and onion rings. I had the burger between two grilled cheese sandwich with their chips. We enjoyed our meals. It's your typical diner food, with a good selection and friendly service. Also a beverage center you can help yourself while waiting.  You can sit at the counter and watch the kitchen staffs and first come first serve.   Recommend and will come back for good diner food.",

While you would think that blueberry cheesecake stuffed waffles would be sweet these were wonderful and they make their compote in house which just shows the love and care they have for their food.   The biscuits and gravy were also fantastic plenty of sausage in the sawmill gravy and full of flavor. I leave with a smile on my face and a happy belly every time.

Ordered the Southern Benedict with cheese grits at the recommendation of the staff and was very disappointed with the quality of this dish. Not to mention my food sat for 15-20 min before it it was given to me after I asked of the progress. I asked the manager to check the quality of the food before I left and he assured me it was fine.  As expected, my portions were incredibly small for Metro standards, there was almost no gravy which was one of selling aspects of the Southern Benedict, my poached eggs over done and the cheese grits had clumped due to the temperature.  I have been to other locations and the service and quality at those locations were fantastic, this was very disappointing. On a bright note, the manager did give me a voucher for my next breakfast so I'll give this location one more try.",

Anyway, this day it was peach iced tea. They had two daily soups, I got the broccoli and cheese and it was delicious.   I ordered the avocado wrap and it was not my favorite.  I didn't see any avocado at all.  It had way too much spinach and it also had fried jalapenos, which were good, but way too much!!! I think they could lighten the spinach, add more fresh avocado, and only a few jalapenos and it'd be perfect!!!   A little pricey, but not too bad. I may try this place again, but only if mom wants to!! She enjoyed her hamburger steak at least!",

Two large pieces of meatloaf, mash potatoes, and grilled squash. Gravy on top. Meatloaf was a little to soft, mushy, for my taste. My mom made the best.  Will I go back, for sure. Hopefully better service. But the food is good and filling.",

Food:A wide variety of choices and more than enough portion sizes.We ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was really good.We also ordered a side of hashbrowns and cornbeef hash.The cornbeef was really unique to me.It consisted of shaved/shredded cornbeef and potatoes.  Service:From the host all the way to the cook behind the counter,the customer service is superb.By name,I interacted with Sherry and Julie and they were both on top of it.What stood out to me the most was that despite how busy the cooks were ALL of them seemed to enjoy their roles.They interacted well together,communicated effectively,and were all patient with one another.I kept telling myself there was no way I could do what they were doing without messing up an order somewhere along the line but they presented to be a cohesive team.  Prices:Appropriately priced for portions and quality of food  Setting:Not that big but big enough for a diner;there is outside seating  There are so many things I want to try on the menu so I'll be back again soon.Thank you Metro Diner for being a great addition to the area!",

    "text": "Overall Under-whelming  On the positive side, the place has a welcoming exterior with a small area for patio dining.   It is easy to find in Matthews Festival, close to the Home Depot and Texas Roadhouse.   The interior decor is pretty standard, nothing stood out one way or the other.  They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day! Any place that serves breakfast all day always gets one star just for that as I am a night person.   When we were seated I noticed the table was not clean and there was some food caked on.  I asked for the table to be wiped down again.  However, it was still sticky whenever I put my arms or hands on the table.   We were looking forward to the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter.  My son ordered this to try and I ordered one of the egg breakfasts and upgraded my side to corn beef hash.  I also ordered the Cheesiest Grits.   The waitress was a bit of a character.  She did not seem super knowledgeable about the menu.    Plates and utensils were placed down.  The utensils were in a wax paper like wrapping - only a fork and knife (no spoon).  When my tea arrived, there was food caked on the plate with the teapot (see photo).  Also one of my two napkins had food on it (see photo).  I was very apprehensive to eat with concerns about cleanliness.    Now for the food.  The homemade corn beef hash is potatoes and meat (no onions, peppers etc.)  I like it like that but it was pretty tasteless.  The Cheesiest Grits were disappointing - plain, unflavored grits with a thin layer of melted cheese on top (see both photos). I was expecting cheese flavored grits with cheese inside as well.  I was never brought over a spoon with the grits and had to ask for one.  No butter was brought over with the toast.  The waffles were nice and fluffy, the strawberry butter is very subtle, in a good way as to not overpower the dish.  The waffles come with \"signature sweet and spicy sauce\".  Our jaws dropped when the waitress came over with a bowl, asked us to hand her the hot sauce on the table, and squeezed some hot sauce in the bowl and mixed in regular pancake syrup! (See photo) I think it would be better for them to do this in the back and leave the \"signature\" recipe to our imaginations.  The chicken was very bony, very salty.  I was expecting more of a honey flavoring for some reason that would go better with breakfast.  The crunchy coating was unremarkable.  The waitress at one point came to our table and motioned with her hands.  We had no idea what she was indicating but then she told us to hand her our plates.  She did not ask if we were done.  We were, but she should have confirmed.  We were asked several times if needed anything so she was attentive, just a bit unconventional.  The chicken & waffles were almost $16, definitely not worth the price tag.  I used the Ladies Room on my way out as I had to wash my hands from the sticky table.  The restroom could have used some cleaning, would grade it a B- as I have seen much worse.  To top it off, it was Mother's Day.  We came at a non-busy hour and two girls were at the host station with no other customers to attend.  They were giving out flowers to mothers and I wanted to see if they offered me one.  It was pretty obvious I was a mom, and although they DID thank us for coming and bid us a nice day, a flower was not offered.  I know I could have asked or taken one, but I wanted to see if they did so.   I am glad to see others had a more positive experience, but I felt the establishment was not clean, the food and service were neutral.  I went with higher expectations but unfortunately will not be dining here again.",

They seem in a hurry to take your order & get your food to you & then that's it . He never asked how was everything or did I need anything. After getting the bill , $ 13.78 before tax , I planned on tipping $3. Paid with a 20 , waited for my change . He brings back a 5 & walks away . Any waiter that expects a tip knows to break up bills so that someone can leave a 20% tip . But I guess he knew what he was doing , while waiting for him to come back by to break 5 , he disappeared again , not having all day to wait on him again , he got the whole 5 , but I won't be back",

Clean and nice! Our waitress was Alicia H and she was courteous and attentive. My first time ever ordering fried chicken with waffles and it was perfect. It's pricey for one person BUT it's so much food! You really could share it with someone else. It's literally half a chicken! It was tender, juicy and crispy on the outside. Love! We went right at 10:30 so there was no wait, but when we left at 11:30 the restaurant was packed which is a good sign. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Love love love the Metro diner! We've been there three times so far and have had a great experience each time. Every time we gone there's been a wait, but it's always been less than what they tell us (usually get quoted 20-25 mins and get seated in about 10) and we enjoy a complementary coffee while we wait.  Generally we've had quick service from the wait staff, who overall seem very knowledgeable and eager to please.  I've always gone with a group, and some of the dishes we've gotten include the Fried Chicken and Waffles, Breakfast Pie, Biscuits and Gravy, Philly Cheesesteak, Bissell Breakfast, and Yohala bread (they usually have different fruit varieties of this).  Far and away the chicken and waffles is the star of the show!  Comes with half of a chicken (you can get all white/dark meat or a mix which is what it standardly comes with) that they season 24 hours prior and that is perfectly crispy outside and wonderfully juicy inside.  It comes with this awesome strawberry butter on top of a thick fluffy waffle. You can have regular syrup but I highly recommend the sweet/spicy syrup that their server mixes at the table for you.  And at my last visit when I wasn't that hungry but couldn't resist that dish, my server informed me that you can get a half portion, which includes half of a waffle and two pieces of chicken, either white or dark meat. This was perfect for me!  I've also had their honey chicken biscuit and side of breakfast potatoes at one visit which was delicious too.  The yohala bread is yummy and a good plate for the table to share.  They also have brunch drinks (mimosa and Bloody Mary) and the drinks are quite large and cheap compared to many brunch places!  I highly recommend this place, will definitely be back for round four soon!",

Went to Cracker Barrel but it was a 2 hour wait. Went to another restaurant in Matthews but they wanted a little too much for a 3 course lunch of turkey. Finally ended up at Metro and was seated right away and ordered the special; waffle made out of stuffing topped with mashed potatoes, turkey and gravy. It was very good; the only thing missing was the green bean casserole. A lot of food and then the dessert (which we had to get to go) came  with the meal for free. Great deal and it was reasonably priced and didn't have to wait all day. Thanks Metro. We'll be back!",

I must say that she was on her job, then another server we later found out his name was Mark. It was nice to see them working in tandem, very pleasant and I will be bringing my family back. I felt like the only guest she had. The food has always been wonderful, but my service has never been so warm before. They are an asset, and as a local restaurant owner, and a diner regular you've done an outstanding job. I tipped them both, watched them, and there sense of urgency made us feel important. I also watched her help others and keep a smile on her face. Those two work well together and your manager that was on her job. A nice blonde headed lady came and spoke to us, first time ever at that location. The winds of change are upon you. I have found that the food at places can be so/ so, but if the service is good we always go back. We went in for breakfast today, again stellar, but the service was not what I had last night. We will come back, we just know who to ask for next time, so anyone using Yelp, go to Metro in Matthews and ask for Candace and or Mark. I never laughed so much, and even my husband tipped better than I have ever seen him do before. So give this place a shot, the food is to die for and the portions are huge. Nothing better than homemade food, fresh flavored coffee and she talked us in a piece of chocolate cake with milk. If there were more than 5 stars, I'd give them to you.  Signed Very happy Diner!!!",

He enjoyed the sandwich but thought the chips tasted funny - ate them anyway. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich with french fries. The chicken salad sandwich was good (chicken could be cut into smaller pieces) . The french fries were NOT good. They tasted like the grease in the fryers needed to be changed badly. I left over 90% of them on my plate. The waitress was friendly and attentive. When she asked if I wanted a box to take the fries home - I told her no I did not like them. I asked how often they change the grease and was told twice a day. She said I was not the first customer to voice that concern today. Waitress said she would let Mgr know, which she did (We heard her tell Mgr). Mgr never came to table. I did hear Mgr tell cook there was a complaint about the fries tasting funny. I certainly was not looking for a free meal or huge discount, but offering to take $2 off the total ticket because of the fries would have been very decent of Mgr.  Unfortunately, either the Mgr couldn't be bothered or didn't care. We might or might not try the place out again, but I hope Mgmt is more responsive to customer complaints while said customer is in the restaurant.",

My pasta potion was HUGE and the sauce had a bite but not too spicy.  Mushrooms right consistency.  Wonderful dish! Now the fried chicken was out of this world amazing.  The skin was soooo crispy and flavorful.  The waitress came out and mixed up syrup and a special hot sauce that was on the table into a little bowl and you dip the chicken in.  Absolutely amazing. Hubby had squash that was very thinly sliced juicy and well seasoned. For a first night they are open, service was great. This is a big place inside.  They also serve breakfast which Matthews desperately needs, it is vey difficult to get into a breakfast place after 8:30 am on weekends. They have outdoor seating. This place I believe comes out of Florida and was on diners drive ins and dives.  Everyone else was really enjoying their meals too.  We can't wait to go back!!!!!",

Let's say I was on edge, I didn't want to leave soaked. Silverware, but no napkins, had to ask for them after food arrived. Chicken Pot Pie - over baked, with little to no creamy filling.  Inconsistent cooking as another table's looked wonderful Reuben - ok, not the best, not the worst, mac & cheese side was cold and did't have a good taste, replaced with fries Burger - ok Chicken & Waffles - no complaint Monti Cristo - awful, meat didn't taste good, oil used to fry was old (over used), in the fryer too long, 2 other people tried it, one agreed the meat wasn't good & the oil was old, the other spit it out Burger - asked how wanted cooked, ordered well done, received medium maybe medium-well, fries were cold, fries were replaced Chicken & Waffles - sauce wasn't included  At the onset, I thought this will be good, maybe I'll bring my husband here, at the end, there is no way I'll step foot back in here.  The one good thing was the take home bags (both Chicken & Waffles, since it was half a chicken, and the Reuben since her husband will eat anything).",

The juice/gravy was salty but no other seasoning noted- black pepper, bay leaf, would have been nice. Husband ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. For the price, should have a vegetable side offering as well. Noted that the dinners did not have vegetables as sides which other similar restaurants offer. This would be a plus if vegetable choices were included.",

It was Saturday morning around 11 and we were seated right away. Our server, I believe his name was chad, was great! We ordered the huevos rancheros, a Belgian waffle, and a daily special: crab cake eggs Benedict. All three were sooo good!! Nothing on the rancheros tasted generic- very flavorful bean mix, fresh salsa, freshly fried jalapenos and tortilla chips. My hubby got the eggs Benedict, which had the whites almost whipped to a merengue texture while still leaving the yolk intact and runny. If I lived near Charlotte this would certainly be a regular place I'd visit.",

    "text": "I was in the Matthews area and was thrilled to see a Metro Diner close by. We went in and were greeted and seated with a smile. The server asked us if we had ever been there before and then shared the daily specials with us. Our waitress was very sweet and may have been new because she had a \"back up\" server it seemed, so we had double the great service. We finally decided on our meal, hubby had pancakes, bacon, hash browns, eggs, English muffin and I had the fish sandwich that wasn't on the menu but as I was scrolling through yelp, I saw it, showed the pic and they made it happen. All of my husbands food was delicious but I had a snafu with my sandwich. The bread was stale. Very hard and tough but the inside was delicious. I immediately informed the server and they took care of it and had another one made. The manager came over and apologized and said they would make sure the bread was fresh and toasted. And the new sandwich was perfect! The coffee was a bit watered down and I'd love it if they had a strong brew option. Nothing like a delicious meal with watery coffee but it was tolerable but I won't likely order it again! Still a fan of this diner despite the bread and coffee. Give it a shot!  That is all!",

The chicken was crispy and didn't have much grease like most restaurants. The biscuit was probably my favorite part it was perfectly crispy. And the grits tasted good, but I added cheese for extra flavor.   Service: We had two servers a older man and a younger women, both were pretty nice and respectful. Overall they were welcoming and got our orders correct. Also they gave refills whenever they saw a nearly empty cup.   Inside Restaurant: The interior was very clean and old fashioned. The floors were clean and the tables didn't have crumbs or smudges. And their bathrooms were also pretty clean.   Overall enjoyed my experience here, and I recommend it to anyone visiting the area or those simply looking for a good all American Breakfast place. A well deserved 4 stars to Metro Diner.",

It's out there a way, so it's taken us some time to try it out. This afternoon was the time. I had the meatloaf plate. It had two large, gravy laden slices of meatloaf, thankfully no ketchup, mashed potatoes and sliced squash, with a chunk of bread that they called a baguette. The meat loaf, on the surface was a little dry, but quite moist and tasty once past the surface. I enjoyed it and despite my initial estimate that I'd be taking some of this home, I ate the whole thing. It was great. As today was a bit chilly inside, I ordered a cup of coffee. Not sure if there was supposed to be refills, but a refill was never offered and I didn't ask. Service was a little slow initially, but she was friendly and very sociable and once we had our drinks, we settled down to order. Most everyone else had the fried chicken. If you have a healthy appetite, then this is the place to go. They don't skimp on the servings, you get a FULL plateful. Everyone was satisfied with their meal and stuffed when we were done. I'd say you can't miss if you go to Metro Diner. Good service, good food, good prices. We all enjoyed our foray out to Metro Diner and I would not hesitate to recommend you give it a shot.",

So, enough about that, back to Metro.  I ordered the Western Omelette with an English Muffin and Hash Brown and I added a side of Sausage Links. The Omelette was good, but nothing great. I wish the cheese was more combined and melted. As for the sausage links, ugh. Not my favorite. My English Muffin was not toasted, which I did send back. Overall, it was a nice breakfast, but nothing great. I did love their coffee and the staff. Like the other location, service is outstanding. For now I'll probably stick with their Pineville-Matthews location.",

One by one our party arrived.  we ended up with another waitress who also seemed not happy to be there.  Glad the food was great and the company was even better.

We had dined at the Pineville location several weeks earlier and were impressed so we decided to give it a try as well.  My wife is not a breakfast fan so we time our arrivals so that she can get whatever she wants and I still have an option for breakfast if that is the direction I want to go.  Pulled in, checked in and were told about 15 to 20 minutes. No problem and guess what, we were seated in about 10 minutes.  Good service after we got seated.  Looking over the menu, my wife ordered iced tea while I went with the Peach Flavored Tea.  Both were very good.  My wife surprised me. She who does not like fish or seafood other than crab, ordered a fish sandwich with a side of fruit. Double surprise in that she actually enjoyed the fish. Nice and moist, very flaky etc.  Side of fruit was a nice treat also since it was more than just melon filler.  I had the Chicken and Waffles and it was great although I will admit I have never had it served with Strawberry Flavored Butter.  We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to the Huntersville location witch is closer to our house.  Generally very good except somewhat crowded but otherwise would recommend to any one who is willing to wait a bit.",

We went in around 6 and were seated right away . My husband ordered Salibury Steak and I had the fish and chips. Both we spot on, I have to say this was the first time ever I ahve gotten actual hand battered fish in Charlotte. The fires were hand cut and crispy, cole slaw great and four pieces of fish. My husband had the Salisbury Steak Special and he cleaned his plate. He said it was hte best he ever had. Now unlike other people I watched the kitchen crew who really have to work in a well orchestrated team or service will go to hell. It was a beautiful scene to seem them all work and follow , fill the orders and expidite. I know not what the average person looks at but to me it only added to the great food. I can't wait to try breakfast (as this area has no good options) I saw some waffles with fesh strawberry butter go by and lunch I saw some beautiful rye bread on plates and I want that next time. Thank you Metro Diner for surpassing my expectations of mediocre food",

The sausage gravy & biscuits came with 2 eggs and hash browns. Definitely enough for 2 people and the flavors and cook was perfect!  Most perfectly cooked hash browns I've ever had. The breakfast burger was amazing and again cooked perfectly, especially the egg, right amount of yolk running when bit into. The Philly cheesesteak was exceptional and very large. I can't wait to visit again. Definitely a 5 star",

Brocolli cheddar soup was surprisingly thick but tasted good, served on the cold side though even though specifically asked for the soup to come hot.

A really great and contemporary atmosphere where you always feel welcome and well cared for! Even though the place was packed I didn't feel like I was being pushed out the door, everyone was very helpful and thoughtful and made us feel like family. Just 15 minutes from Charlotte, it's really convenient to grab a bite and head into town! They will always work around your dietary needs and genuinely want to provide a great experience all around. Whether you want a family brunch or just to grab a bite with a friend late at night, this is my go-to place! Highly recommend their Chicken and Waffles, the Yo Halla on the Square, and the Shrimp and Grits - some of our favorites! I am also personally a hashrown addict and boy are theirs good!! Prices are really reasonable with generous portions and incredible quality. Thanks to the whole staff and manager Julie!!!!",

    "text": "So I couldn't give a zero since yelp only allows you to give one star as a minimum so I guess we'll start there. I've Been wanting to come to Metro diner for some time due to the fairly good ratings that the establishment has.  I was with youngest son and we came in on a Saturday about lunchtime and of course we knew we'd have to wait but we were lucky enough to sit at the bar and actually watch the cooks create the meals. It's a novel concept I certainly like it however you need to make sure that you're actually following food safety rules.  We were greeted by a great waiter who is promptly taking our order and then we sat and watch the kitchen staff it took about 15 minutes to maybe 20 minutes to get actually get our meal.  During that time I didnt witness any kitchen staff change their gloves after touching other areas or their clothing or face area. This is called cross contamination and for those of you not in the food service business that's a big no-no.  I watched a who I can only believe was a kitchen manager take the trash out and then turn around to come back only to begin and prep food again without changing his gloves. Now I have no idea that he didn't change his gloves but he was only gone for a few seconds and the same gloves appeared to be on that he had before so I have to assume the gloves weren't changed.   Two other preppers I witnessed wipe things off on their clothes and then continue to touch food again, it's a big no-no they should've change your gloves.  I ordered the Swiss burger and it sat underneath the lamp for probably 7 to 8 minutes before it was served to me the reason I know this was because I was sitting next to the serving area. The bun was left on and by the time the food got to me the meat of the burger was cold. I explained a manager that I wasn't interested in eating it because the meat was cold, she then explained to me that they never placed a bun on top of the food it should've been left to the side. That wasn't the issue the issue was the meat was cold the lettuce was wet she just didn't listen to me. She had already came to the conclusion that the bun was the issues.  My son ordered grilled cheese with some fries, fries were way too salty almost over salty and not edible so we didn't finish that meal.  In the end the manager told me that she was buying our lunch, I knew I wasn't paying for something I sent back and didn't eat. It was a nice gesture however I think she thought I was paying for it and was doing me a favor. Not sure if I miss understood her or she me.   I explain to her that she just needed to take my meal off and I would continue to pay for my sons meal but explained that she Wanted is to come back so we'd have a better experience next time.   Experience wasn't bad it was the food that was bad therefore I will not under any circumstances come back to that establishment again",

We arrived just as the wait list cleared, so keep that in mind if you're thinking about popping out for a quick meal.  I chose the meat lovers omelet minus the potatoes and the bread. Hooray for the keto diet, which is still working for me. It did not take very long to be prepared and arrived at the table still hot. They have Louisiana Hot Sauce at the table, which is a nice variety to the usual Tabasco.  Our service was good. Our waitress kept the water glasses filled, cleared the dirty dishes and took care of the check swiftly. I'm a fan.  [Review 11647 overall, 1428 of 2019.]",

I was first introduced to Metro Diner last year when we did a couple elite events with them. I've been a big fan ever since. There's a real lack of diners here in the Charlotte area, so it's nice to have a few of these in the Charlotte area. They're a little nicer than your typical diner, not so much hole in the wall.  The menu is huge, they have it all. I usually get the San Francisco Benedict (two poached eggs, Canadian bacon, sliced avocado, and tomato). I get hashbrowns with it and add cheese, peppers, onions and jalapenos. I really love their Chicken & Waffle. First of all, be warned that it's massive. It comes with a sweet strawberry butter and a sweet & spicy syrup type sauce (it's sooo good, I would probably eat a shoe if it was covered in that). They also have this crazy Holy Davoli burger. It's basically a burger stuffed in between two grilled cheese sandwiches. Delicious.  Make sure to check the board, they usually have specials as well. Everyone is really friendly here, always have great service. They also have a counter you can sit at, so you can peep in the kitchen.",

Prices are very reasonable. They have new specials every day.   Atmosphere is very much like a diner. Nothing fancy but well maintained and clean.   It's always fairly busy but they get food out quick so you're not waiting too long, if at all. I've never had to wait for a table of two but usually a larger party has to wait a moment. Weekend mornings and lunch seem to be the peak busy time.",

Fast service, good coffee and tasty food.  I had the biscuits and gravy with hashbrowns and over easy eggs.  The portion of biscuits and gravy was huge and delicious. That alone could have filled me up!  The eggs were perfectly done.  What more could you ask for?",

    "text": "OK so have to start this off saying I am little bias for diners!  There are not a lot of True diners out there, but when I walked into this place at 10:45am and asked if they were serving lunch yet the hostess replied, \"We server everything on the menu all the time.\" YES! a True diner!  I get to work fairly early and am usually ready for lunch anywhere between 10 and 11am.    Was greeted by my server right away and served my requested beverage.  They started to loose a star here because after looking at the menu for just a minute I knew what I wanted and trying to get the servers attention was a bit annoying, especially when the people behind me, left and tables was cleaned then new person sat down and ordered his meal before she ever came back to me.  However she was very kind and kept my drink filled (very important to me) and redeemed that number 5 star.    Haven't tried a lot on the menu since this was my first time, but I got the Philly Cheese-steak and fries.  Portion sizes were ample and food tasted really good.  Nothing too fancy and traditional diner food cooked correctly!    As I mentioned I am bias for diners and they hold a special place in my heart because my Grandfather took me to diners as a boy (many many years ago), he loved local diners and he would have loved this place.  I was thinking about him the whole time and our restaurant visits.    If I had any complaints it is only that too many people know about this gem and you have to hit them at the right times if you don't like waiting.  Highly recommend trying them out!",

I enjoyed the flavor of the French Toast yet not the consistency but delicious none the least. But my teammate did order the waffle and fried chicken she enjoyed it. I did taste the strawberry butter and it was very good.  Now, I KNOW why they are famous for their fried chicken, it's DELICIOUS!!! Soo flavorful!!! Definitely get something with fried chicken!!

    "text": "We decided to try this new restaurant in town from which we've heard a lot about, when we arrived it was quite busy the hostess informed us that the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes, a party of 7 arrived probably 5 to 10 minutes after we did;  as we waited and waited for a long long time well over the 20 minutes they said we would wait, the party of seven was sat before us. The food was good my Philly cheese steak sandwich was okay, pretty small though.  Everyone's dinner was okay, service considering it was a service manager who took care of us was I guess friendly, nonetheless I was very upset about having to wait so long and having a party of 7 sat in front of us noting that we were a party of six. I am not sure I will come back to this place it was a very bad experience overall because there was no acknowledgement of why we waited so long, no apology or anything.",

    "text": "Oh, dear lord....this is what we have been waiting for!  An adorable place with a free DIY coffee bar while you wait! They served French toast that must have had 2 cups of blueberries on top. It was so large that my bottomless teenage son ate it for 2 meals. The burger was a half pound and then had a mound of stuff on top! The meatloaf was excellent, the hot turkey plate was bliss but....THE BACON. IT MUST BE ILLEGAL. This stuff has a texture I've never had before. It's thin, which usually isn't good, and its crispy, which I hate, but it shatters like that fine sugar crust on a creme brulee. It's stunningly good - so good that we encouraged the table next to us to order it and they thanked us when we left.  The wait can be long during the after-church hours but they serve breakfast all day. It's old school but brand new and has the best of everything. It's what great diner food should be, which is the hardest thing of all: huge menu options and it all has to be excellent. They succeed.",

    "text": "Went there yesterday for a late lunch (about 3pmish).  Got served a COLD what was to be a Hot Turkey Plate.  Had to send it back, meanwhile the other person is eating their lunch alone.  So consequently we had to eat in shifts watching each other eat.  Practically had to beg for refills on our beverages to the point I got up twice to find my own refills.  So needless to say the service was awful!!!  One would think that since the restaurant wasn't busy the service would be good, NOT!!!  Had to complain to management, which the server should have let the manager know what was going on but I guess if you can't keep the drinks filled then you don't have enough common sense to let the manager know what went wrong at one of your tables.  The manager did pick up the tab which was the only right thing that happened.  WORD TO THE WISE...serve the food at the right temperature, and get better servers!!!!!!!!",

One thing I will comment on tho is the interior decoration.  I've eaten both outside on the \"patio\" and inside, and prefer outside ( tho it'd be good if the management could stop people taking smoking breaks on the bench around the corner).  But the inside just looks too dingy to me. I don't know what the owners were striving for in the design look, but it doesn't shout \"diner\" to me at all ... not like the ones' I've experienced in the NorthEast. The checkered floor appears grayish instead of black and white ..maybe a good cleaning would help. The dark wood booths also lend to the cheap, almost dank feel.  More like an old barbecue joint than a modern take on a \"diner\".  The entire inside needs to be lighter and brighter ( I suggest the owners take a look at the interior at Stacks for comparison).     So good food and good people, but please upgrade the inside a little !!!",

We walked in and asked for a specific server that we had in the past and were told that we couldn't have him as he had no tables available  (think metro diner...he's the reason that we came back).  We were settled in the back room which we had once before and is a death sentence for good service as you're out of site and forgotten. My oldest daughters order was incorrect and thus sent back. By the time her order returned everyone else in the party was virtually finished.  My youngest daughter, who is a vegetarian, pulled out an insect on her fork roughly the size of a cooked piece of rice...eyes visible!!  When I showed it to the manager she stated \"...I'm sorry, the staff didn't clean the dirt off of the vegetables properly \"...um, dirt doesn't have eyes!!! I am not a person to cause a seen but when the bill came and we were being charged $42 for lunch (6 people, they didn't charge for either of the aforementioned meals) I was kinda taken back. How did they justify charging my table ANYTHING when a health code was potentially violated?  Very disappointing experience",

Our server Taylor was beyond awesome from drinks to check (and beyond when I forgot my box of leftovers)! I love the breakfast offerings so much that I had yet to go beyond that section of the menu. Today, I finally convinced myself to try the other side. Ok, so I didn't completely step away from my fave type of food because I ended up with the breakfast burger. This ain't your typical patty with an egg on it. I was presented with a monster on a bun. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection with a nice char on the outside. It was topped by a slab of cheddar, crispy hash browns, thick cut bacon, and a freshly fried egg. This burger was beautifully made and that 1st bite made me wonder what else I've been missing in this place! I wish I was exaggerating the awesomeness of this burger. My lunch date kept giving me side-eye with all of my exclamations of delight with each taste. I pride myself on trying new things but this may become my first \"usual\". As good as it was, it was too big for me to finish. The point is, have a burger. Better yet try everything because I've never had a bad bite in this place! Bring a date, the family, and your appetite this is it folks.  Service 10/10 Food 10/10",

One egg was way over cooked, and the other was way under. How does that happen? The hollandaise was bland, the English muffin was stale, and the tiny piece of Canadian bacon couldn't save it.   My husband had a croissant breakfast sandwich and did not enjoy it. He also said it was stale, with fake cheese, and bland. He got a side of fruit thinking at least that will be good. Nope. The fruit was frozen solid, and he could barely eat any of it.    Next time I'm going to suck it up and drive the 35 minutes to Cafe Monte for a real, good brunch experience.",

I watched our meals sit at the window for almost 10 minutes.  We were brought three of the four plates, at different times.  The person sorting and distributing seemed overwhelmed.  We had to ask for the fourth plate as I watched it sit at the window while other meals went out around it.  As a result the food was just meh.  My yohala was super soggy, the grits were over cooked and the pot pie was dry.   I'm not sure if sitting at the window contributed or not.

They have a menu with a lot to offer, you can even order breakfast for dinner, watch out IHOP, they also had specials on a board in addition to the menu. I chose the Bold City burger, delicious!  How could it not be?  A burger with a sausage patty, yummy!  I also ordered mixed veggies for my side which were very tasty, better than expected.  I ordered the peach tea and it was also really good. My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken plate, and the mashed potatoes were sooo good.  He also got a huge portion of food, 4 pieces of chicken!   My friend ordered a special which was shredded pork on a cornbread waffle, I tasted her waffle because being the Southern chick I am, I love cornbread,  and I loved that waffle, I could make a meal on that alone, but wouldn't want to because there's too many things I want to go back and try. I really want to go back for breakfast one day.   This restaurant is one of my new faves.  Give it a try, you won't leave hungry. The waitress and staff are also very friendly here.",

Please note, we had already devoured 2/3 of the onion rings before I took this pic! So Plenty for us three! Entrees: American burger with bacon- excellent and huge  Pot roast - perfect according to my dad who couldn't but half  Fish and chips - my mom said the batter used was tasty and she would review her whole meal, slaw included as excellent! Service was great! Friendly hostess who took care of us right away, and our server Liz was just as delightful and so wonderful the entire time ! She was so pleasant and offered advice that we followed and weren't let down. Will be back and hope to try the breakfast items next time! thanks MetroDiner. Matthews is thankful you're here !",

Hands down, the star of the show was the chicken and waffles. They give you half a chicken that is perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried, and perfectly juicy - even the breast! Dip it in the maple/hot sauce that the waiter mixes for you, and you're in chicken fried heaven.",

We were seated in a huge booth in the back which was nice considering it was just two of us. The coffee was delicious, but it took a while to get a refill. The food also took some time to arrive, but the waitress apologized for the delay and said they usually aspire for an 8 minute turnaround. My Greek omelet was tasty thanks to the olives, otherwise it would have been bland. The potatoes were a tad bland, but they were nicely cut. The pancake was thick and satisfying. My husband didn't care for his huevos rancheros because he felt there was too much going on. He would have preferred a simpler take on the dish. Overall, we had a good experience and will return.  My husband ordered a pumpkin cheesecake to go which looked really good.",

Also they have mimosas and a special flavored coffee of the day  The service is some of the best I've ever seen in Matthews. Friendly, attentive, and very quick to follow up on drink refills ( I mention the latter because I hate to run out of my tea/coffee ). The diner is almost always full, the food comes out within 15-20 minutes of ordering and always hot. The tomato bisque soup needs to be in a store shelf so I can buy it by the gallon!!! It's really that creamy and delicious. And don't get me started on the portion sizes , Yowza!!! I just automatically ask for a to go container because there is no finishing any of the dishes I've ordered. Sunday's seem to be the busiest day with a wait, there is also a nice heated patio to take advantage of during the busy times.",

I didn't realize that they closed so early (8:00 pm Sunday - Thursday) until after I ate and walked out the door.  Makes perfect sense though, looking back at the body language and cues from the staff. It seemed like they were hoping we'd leave and not order anything, as it took a fairly long time for someone to come over.   Our server was nice and smiley (pretty much the only one there that was) but it was clear what was up when we took our first bite and our bill came.  They also ended up seating a family of 5 with a baby well after us so I'm not sure what the rushing was all about.  I also never got that water refill...  My rueben was just ok. It had bits of hard boiled egg and pickle relish in it.  That is fairly odd and not even listed on the menu like that.  I haven't ever seen those in a rueben and hopefully never will again.  (Edit-big bits, more like chunks of egg whites and yolk.  Not very appetizing and the whites were sort of chewy. I know there are lots of recipes for dressing but I will still stand by my opinion of it not being typical to have chunks of egg on a rueben.) The salisbury steak was good though.   This was actually my 2nd visit but there is definitely an \"off vibe\" at this place.  The first time I got a chicken salad sandwich and tomato bisque.  Some of the chicken was big, dry and chewy and the soup was too much like jarred pasta sauce.    It probably would have been better if they did turn us away this time.  Two strikes is enough for me.  I doubt I will ever be back.",

    "text": "The good - good food, fresh ingredients (ex. hand chopped potatoes for home fries, fresh jalapenos) , great portions, nice job on the interior remodel - can' t even tell it was an Italian restaurant before at all!   The not so good - freezing inside and a bit pricey for breakfast. Waited 15 minutes for one of three tables outside. $10 for a BLT. Wait staff also seem to still coming up to speed on the job on prior visit, but much better second visit. Pleasant service from Ashley.  Can't wait for remaining kinks to be worked out and happy to have in Matthews.",

    "text": "A Metro Diner..I had heard a lot about the Monte Cristo sandwich that they had served at one of the other locations. So we came looking for that treat but it has been taken off the menu. I wish they would put it back on because it seems like most everything they make at this location is really good. We had a fairly large group but they accommodated us very quickly.  I was sad to see that the Monte Cristo was gone but I ordered the Chicken and Waffles which was really good. It was crisply fried chicken and nice big waffles and lots of spicy syrup and some strawberry butter. I ordered hashbrowns on the side and they were terrific! My husband had the Bacon Mushroom Swiss burger and it was a good juicy burger also. I ordered the Peach Unsweetened Tea. It was a nice clean diner to eat in. I would go back and would love it if they added that Monte Cristo back on the menu that I heard so much about !",
