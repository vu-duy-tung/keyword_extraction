    "text": "I chose this restaurant based on the number of positive reviews.   I was concerned about eating Vietnamese in Ballantyne as (a) typically things are overpriced in this area and (b) there are not many native Vietnamese in this area.  Given that I was craving Vietnamese flavor, I ordered vermicelli with pork.   Yes, this dish was overpriced.   Once the dish arrived, there was no complimentary plate of basil, mint, bamboo sprouts, or jalapenos.   As typical, there was a meager amount of sauce served on the side.    I was given more sauce when I asked which is a positive.   While the meat had a charcoal charred flavor, it was a bit salty and tougher than expected.   I was extremely disappointed with the percentage of TOUGH MEAT.   I suspect the saltiness had to do with a lower quality of meat.   The vermicelli were good.   Flavor overall was good.   It appears that herbs - mint, basil, etc - were premixed into the dish which was fine but NOT traditional.   Overall, I think this restaurant is fairly typical of Asian flare in Charlotte - overpriced, relatively good, but certainly NOT comparable to what one might find in Atlanta, Washington or NYC.",

    "text": "I had given up hope of finding good pho here--every shop I've tried in Charlotte has been watery, tasteless soup. But Be's is hearty rich broth like I've had in Saigon, stewed for days with all the fat skimmed off. The meat is super tender and the noodles are just right--chewy, not too thick and not too thin. The accompaniments are fresh, the lemongrass chicken sandwich is amazing, but the best item on the menu is the pork belly skewers. They don't serve you huge hunks riddled with fat. Instead, you have delicious ribbon curls heated over high flames and covered in the most tasty sweet and salty seasoning. The texture is like chewy bacon, but so much better. A definite must-have. The cashier who recommended this to me said she had eaten two orders plus a pork belly sandwich--and it was barely 11am!",

You order at the counter and pick a seat with the numbered flag and the staff brings your food out to you. My family and I had the good fortune of having the owner and chef bring it out a couple of times and chat with us. She's super chill with a wealth of experience, tradition and a longtime CLT restaurant pedigree to back up her pho. In the month that they've been operating they've started reaching capacity for lunch service. Go here soon before they start turning people away at the door.",

It's pretty close to my office so I like to go when I'm feeling sick or it's really cold/gloomy outside. Something about this soup is really comforting! I have only tried the chicken pho (pho ga) and it's amazing. They give you all the accoutrements on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want. There's also Sriracha and hoisin sauce available if you need some more spice or flavor. The people who work here are so nice and were very patient with me the first time I went. The restaurant itself is pretty small but that adds to the charm in my opinion. Definitely check this place out if you're in the mood for pho!",

The accompanying toppings including the beef, which I always get, were plentiful and were a good combination of crunchy vegetables and herbs. The bahn mi with the pork is my go to dish. The thinly sliced pork is infused with so much flavor I could eat it all day. The rolls are crispy and fresh and the accompanying vegetables complement the protein but do not overpower it. Be's is a hidden gem located in the back of a strip mall. For those that have found it, they are experiencing some of the best Vietnamese food in the Queen City.",

    "text": "Thanks to yelp, I \"discovered\" this place yesterday.  Yelp suggested four new places in my neighborhood and this was one of them.  A pho and banh mi  fix in Ballantyne?  Really, are you sure?  Yes, it's True.  After a trip to the movies, we hustled to the car and headed over to check it out.  I longed to not be disappointed because since moving here from the DC area, I've been longing for more diversity in the food choices and here we are.  I ordered an original banh mi sandwich ($7.00), some spicy beef noodle soup($11.00) and some fried egg rolls($5.00) which were more crispy spring rolls.  Prices do seem to be a bit higher than I'm used to but the banh mi is easily shareable, and the size of the pho along with the amount of meat is good.  Plus, you have to consider that their rent is a bit higher because of the location.      My two teens didn't order anything but I told them they could try my stuff and decide.  They have jobs, they can pay for their own food. LOL!  The rolls came out right away with the accompanying dipping sauce, followed shortly by the banh mi and boy was it good. Not soon after my steaming bowl of soup came out and mmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmm, good!!!  The broth was no nice!  I put my accoutrements in after getting extra mint and jalapenos and dove right in.  Both daughters got up and placed their own orders.  One got the mignon pho and an original banh mi and the other got the crispy egg rolls and the mignon pho.  Very enjoyable and my only complaint is that the jalapenos in my banh mi all seemed to be quite mild and I love the kick of spicy in my sandwich so next time I'll ask that they put extra in with seeds and all.  I have zero complaints about the soup.  I actually ran out of noodles before running out of the tender meat that was swimming in the rich broth.  That has never happened to me before.  I've been eating pho before it was a thing. Twenty plus years ago, I had a Vietnamese roomie and she introduced me to pho and banh mi when they were hard to find and not too many Americans even knew what they were.  I've even made it myself but the beef bone broth is an arduous and long event that entails skill and exacting spice knowledge.  I decided it was easier to just buy it even though mine was quite delicious.    This is the second place i've had pho since moving to Charlotte just over a year ago and it certainly is my go to spot now for banh mi and pho.  And it's in my hood!! Woohoo!  I really hope this place succeeds and I hope to see more authentic places like this opening up around town.  Charlotte needs some diversity in her food scene.  Check this place out and lets keep it busy.  I hope that they never compromise the quality of the food that they are putting out now.  Oftentimes you see over time, that the quality diminishes along with the portion sizes and then it's no longer the place you fell in love with. Let's hope this doesn't happen with this place.    Oh, and the service was great. Very friendly, very efficient and we were even given a complimentary grilled chicken banh mi to try.  We left stuffed with our leftovers in hand to enjoy just a few hours later. Yes, I took my broth home because who in their right mind would throw that stuff away?  Add some noodles to it and enjoy another round and if you don't have pho noodles in your cabinet just heat it up and enjoy some tasty hot broth and a sandwich.  Now get in your car and give it a try.  That is all!",

    "text": "It's been almost a year since my last review so I guess it's time for another one.   I ordered takeout the other day for my mom and I. We wanted a little variety so she ordered the Pho Ga & I ordered the Tofu Vermicelli. We also decided to split a Tofu Banh Mi.   I was the only customer in the restaurant besides someone who was finishing up their food. My order took about 15 minutes to get prepared but I guess it was because they had a few call-in orders. The girl at the counter was friendly & patient with me asking questions and leaving stuff out (no cilantro, no mayo, no onions). Everything was packed up nicely.   My mom enjoyed her Pho Ga. There was plenty of chicken in the soup and she said the broth didn't have any msg flavor. The pho condiments were very fresh and I added a few basil leaves to my vermicelli dish.   Tofu Vermicelli was super tasty but different. The tofu had a lemongrass flavor to it and it wasn't just the standard lettuce, pickled carrots and daikon, bean sprouts, & cucumbers in it. It also had broccoli, string beans, and snow peas- vegetables that don't normally come with this dish, making it seem less authentic. I forgot to tell them to leave out the mint, but it was a good thing I forgot because the flavor was not overpowering & very refreshing. Fish sauce was great too.   Now the not so good. I ordered the Tofu Banh Mi without the mayo or cilantro but the pickled carrots and daikon (my favorite part!) were sadly left out. The baguette was a little soggy but that may have been due to the tofu in it. The tofu was the best part. It has the same lemongrass flavor that my vermicelli noodles had. The worst part (for me) was that when I was almost done eating my half of the banh mi, I noticed some meat-like thing at the bottom of the sandwich. My mom and I had no idea what it was (I was thinking pork/pate but she thought it was kind of fishy) but it totally ruined it for me. I guess in all fairness the menu did not say VEGETARIAN Tofu Banh Mi, but you just don't expect there to be meat in a tofu banh mi.   Overall food was pretty good, besides the banh mi. If I'm craving vermicelli noodles but I don't want to drive too far out, I'd be happy to come here again. I would just ask for the standard vegetables though. If I want a banh mi, I'll just stick with Crispy Banh Mi on South Blvd.",

Sweetie, not being an enjoyer of pho and a vegetarian came with.  She had the tofu with veggies.  She loved the veggies, the tofu not so much.  It seemed like it was fermented or something and didn't like the taste.  No matter, we said something to the young lady working and her Mom gave us a nice to go box of more veggies which was very nice of them.  Well played Be's!  I had the Chicken Pho which was amazing.  Just what I needed.  Flavorful broth, chicken and everything else just went together.  They gave me extra bean sprouts and a nice sprig of basil to add on my own.  I stayed away from the jalapenos but they looked fresh.  I really liked it here.  Very nice and accommodating.  This place is a welcome addition to the area and I hope they're able to keep the word out so they stick around for a long time!",

Just saddle up to a bowl of warm beef broth, filled to the brim with meats, noodles and accoutrements, thanks to a bonafide Vietnamese chef who just gets it. The getting it being that properly made pho is all about that broth, bout that broth, no shi#.   We tried the combo pho, bahn mi pork sandwich, combination vermicelli plate, and spring rolls. All were tasty and fresh.",

    "text": "Read about this place on the new recommended Yelp newsletter. I am a big fan of Vietnamese food and I prefer the authentic kind. This places promises good quality.  The owner is very friendly and the staff is attentive and kind. The place is modern, fresh and clean. And the staff really cares about their customers and the place. Bathrooms are clean. Ample parking in front of the place.  Now to the food. There are options between Vietnamese sandwiches, pho, rice plates and appetizers. I love good summer rolls. Here they call them spring rolls. The summer rolls come with fresh big shrimp pieces! Wow! Generally this is where many places save on the fish not here. The spring rolls come with a peanut sauce. I then ordered a spicy noodle pho for $11. And when she brought the bowl to the table, I was surprised and happy. It was so large and so worth the money. It comes with a plate of fresh cabbage, basil and lime. Sauces are available on each table too. I ended up taking the rest of the soup home. I also had the egg rolls with pork with a very interesting and yummy side sauce. Sooo good.   I had a wonderful experience and since I don't frequent in this area much, I will come here when I am in the area or if I crave some good Vietnamese food. But it is definitely worth the drive for me. A new location will be opening around May close to uptown, this will be much closer for me.",

The product was in a three compartment container and everything was separated, so no meat cooking because it was poorly sitting on warm noodles.

    "text": "Seeing as how this is my 7th visit in a month, I figured it was time for a review. Let me preface this by saying I love pho. I've been eating it since I was in my teens, grew up in a city with a large Vietnamese population. My 4 stars are for the pho.  On to the review.... I discovered Be's via yelp a month ago, turns out it's 4 blocks from my house. I was a bit skeptical, as pho is not popular in Ballantyne. I usually drive down South blvd to Doan's or Saigon Palace for my pho fix. The restaurant used to be a sushi place (terrible), so I was happy to see this take its place.   Ambiance: Small, very clean, usually quiet spot. It can get VERY busy at lunch. There are a few booths, tables and a couple counter chairs.  Food: I usually get the pho ga, which is wonderful (5 stars). Great broth, flavorful. I mean, really good, it can stand on it's own without the accompaniments. Tons of shredded chicken breast as well. They do not skimp on the quantity. The pho comes with the usual add ins, basil, lime, peppers, sprouts.  I tried the lemongrass banh mi and was disappointed. The bread was stale and tough, too much mayo/sauce and flavorless chicken. Iill pass.  On my last visit I was craving lemongrass chicken (stir fry), yeah, no. It was worse than the sandwich. Rubbery chicken, watery sauce, the flavor was off.  Service: Usually good service. Order at the counter, get a number, pick a seat. The only issue I had was when I told them I didn't like the lemongrass stir fry, after one bite. They apologized, but still made me pay for my pho. No offer to fix/refund my dish.  All in all, a pretty good spot for pho in the burbs!",

The food here is simply phenomenal. We just moved to Fort Mill from Greenville, SC, where he had a VERY solid Vietnamese option that we visited almost every week. We've tried a few places in and around Fort Mill, and none of them came close to that spot.   Well, we have found our new spot. We both went in with the idea that we were going to get Pho, but their Bun dishes looked awesome so we both changed our minds when we arrived - but don't worry, we'll be back to try to the Pho as well.   Our bowls were filled with rice vermicelli noodles over a bed of lettuce and mint. The other traditional items were also there as well, and the sauce was on point. I got the combination Bun, while the wife got the chicken. All the proteins were flavorful, tender and plentiful.   Honestly, this is some of the best Bun I've had. Period.   On top of everything else, the prices were reasonable to boot!   We WILL be back to this place!  FYI - you'll place your order at the counter and take a number, they do not offer full table service as far as I can tell.",

I was standing in line with my mouth set on some what looked to be delicious pho but noticed that the sanitation score was an unbelievable 90.5. I blerted it out not intentionally. The owner of this restaurant then told me to go somewhere else if I didnt like it. Coming from the restaurant industry I know that it's pretty bad when you get a 90.5. Cross contamination is a huge issue for this restaurant and its gross. I didnt see not one person wash their hands. I noticed the owner taking payments then handling togo orders without washing his hands. I mean we all know how gross money is wash your hands. The tables were not being cleaned when other patrons would leave and new ones wanted to sit. They literally picked up the plates and dusted the crumbs in the floor. Not to mention they didnt even get my friends order correct.",

My kids had the sliced filet mignon Pho and it was really good and a ton of broth with lots of fixin's to dress it up how you like it. They both ate all of the meat and a bunch of noodles and still a good lunch the next day.   Wife and I both had the curry rice. She went Tofu and I went chicken.Loved the flavor on the curry. I mixed in nearly all of the rice eventually to make sure I ate all of the sauce. The chicken was pretty dry which would be my only complaint with the whole place. Nearly every dish is about $10 so again a good value. Clean, new and very good service.",

I ALMOST pulled my hair back in a ponytail I was so into it. I do believe I also met Be. She was very nice and friendly. I think it's great she takes the time when she has it to meet her guests.

Had the lemongrass pork belly appetizer.  It was delicious. It was the main \"meal\" for my young daughter.  The staff were nice enough to bring out not only the spicy sauce it is usually served with, but also a special peanut sauce and fish sauce that were not spicy.  She loved the peanut sauce.  Pho was amazing.  Among the best I have had anywhere.  Broth was clear and very rich. Lots of meat, more than other places will serve.  Brisket was great, meatballs very nice, and the filet was really tender.  I wish they offered tendon as an option for the Pho, and that they included jalapenos with the accompaniments for the Pho.  Maybe they just ran out.  Happy to see a steady stream of customers when I was there.  Hopefully this place sticks around, as I really want to get back there soon and try other menu items.  Bun and Banh Mi for sure.",

I guess I shouldn't be surprised since I'm used to areas with larger Vietnamese communities (Seattle, SF, ATL, etc).  The menu was quite limited.  The broth didn't have much nuance, but at least it didn't seem to be bullion based. I think the others who I ate with were happy with theirs (one had bun and another pho) but I was left quite wanting... and ready to go home for good pho!",

Both had just the right amount of flavor and spice with the typical beansprouts, jalapenos, and basil leaves on the side. Only thing that threw me off was the cabbage on the side of the beef brisket Pho. It wasn't really needed in the soup as much as the sprouts and jalapenos. Either way, I would definitely recommend a visit!",

    "text": "A good intro into Vietnamese food but strays from being truly authentic.  The concept is very intriguing. It's almost like fast food Vietnamese cuisine. You have to go up to the counter to order your food. We got the pork banh mi ($7) and the combination vermicelli bowl ($11). A couple of things caught me off guard:  -Where are the greens in the vermicelli bowl? (Yes there's a bit underneath everything but it was unbalanced) -The pork tastes straight up like chinese restaurant pork (the ones that give free samples on a toothpick). Yes it's good but it shouldn't taste like that.  -The bread in the banh mi was pretty bland and mediocre.  Having said that the BBH and the pho looked pretty good. Will have to go back to try those next time.  It seems like this restaurant has a locational advantage with not much competition nearby, but I really recommend to those that enjoy this restaurant to try other places such as Flaming Kitchen Pho or Banh Mi Bros. If you're ever on the west coast Lee's Sandwhiches will blow you away.  Taste: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Value: 3/5",

The store is owned by a adorable local lady name Ms. Be, she's there early morning hustling in preparation of quality food.  Pho- no MSG is used and the broth is very clean, clear, and flavorful. When you get your pho before you jazz it up with Siracha, look and taste the broth and you will see how she has a very clear and flavorful broth! She sources her beef from never frozen meat and bones and you can really taste it in her food. The pieces of beef is so good I just wish it came with more!   Banh Mi- I use to drive all the way to Le's bakery but the flavor in her meat is incredible!  The pork was VERY juicy and Smokey as they grill to order. The bread is sourced locally and very crispy and airy on the inside!   When your hungover, cold, or just a PHOking pho lover like me, come herE! Being it down the road from my house I can come straight out of bed to Be's!",

I've never experienced anything this authentic in Charlotte, at least I think it's authentic because I've never had Pho before. It was very spicy which some people like, there was A LOT of fatty bits that I didn't eat, ( well I did eat a piece of meat off the fat, which was good), the flank steak was good,I didn't  know what was all in my soup but it was very interesting and very spicy. I don't eat pork and I'm guessing there was pork sausage in my Spicy Flank steak soup, like I said I had no idea what to expect going in, but I read reviews and was like why the f not. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich.",

I'm a vegetarian and 99% of the noodle places I've been in have alternatives or make a price adjustment for not serving meat. I was having a bad day, craved noodles and took my lunch to drive 40 minutes and this place just wasted my time. I'm not sure if he didn't like the way I looked or what the deal is but it was a terrible experience and waste of time. I'd advise anyone to stay away from here. Bad business.

Very yummy, especially with the fresh lime and jalapeno on top.   One of the employees kept checking on us to make sure we were okay and had what we needed.  The place is intimate and filled with customers.  I wish they had a bigger space and a few more tables, but that was not a big issue.  I waited for five minutes to get a table, so it wasn't bad.

We didn't realize how much food you get with Pho and Banh Mi so we each ordered a bowl of Pho. My wife had the sliced filet and I had the combination. We also ordered a regular Banh Mi sandwich to split. This food is so filling and flavorful, the warm broth cooks the thin sliced filet and warms the noodles and veggies and the Thai basil and cilantro are amazing in the broth. That sandwich hits all the senses and tastes. Service was quick and courteous and my wife and I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic and filling meal.",

The chicken is tender, and absolutely full of flavor, and the homemade mayo is the perfect addition. There are so many new places to try in the Charlotte metro area but since moving here over a year ago I keep coming back to Be's. Over and over, and then sometimes twice in one weekend. You also can't go wrong with the crispy rolls and lemongrass chicken vermicelli. Can't get enough!",

Perfect food and wonderful service on each visit. I will keep going back!  ------------- If I could give it a 6 star review I would in a heartbeat.  We had a beef pho, a chicken pho, and a chicken sandwich among a family of four and barely finished it all.  The portions are great.  Let me just say I wanted to try this place for a few weeks and it exceeded my expectations.  Great service comfy seating and AMAZING food!  The chicken pho was phenomenal.  The broth had an incredible amount of flavor.  When I added jalepenos, sprouts, and a small amount of basil everything meshed well.  I could hardly stop eating.  The chicken sandwich was very good and my normally picky son loved it.  In fact both kids were blown away by all of the food.  The chicken pho was the hands down winner for everyone.  A fantastic meal and great place to have a meal.  My kids were asking if we could go back for lunch tomorrow.  What else needs to be said?",

I went in for the lemongrass chicken bahn mi and pork belly skewers, they no longer serve the pork belly which I was ok with but they are on the menu in the restaurant so should be removed. I opted for the bahn mi and a coffee. I was told it would be about ten minutes, not a problem. At about 15+ minutes I started to wonder how long it would take to make a sandwich and had finished my coffee. I noticed someone behind the counter look over and ask another employee where my order was and then they started rushing around. A young man came out and said \"Um, we forgot to make the sandwich but are making it now\" This was one sandwich, not a huge order and they were not busy. Finally my sandwich was out and the girl did apologize but offered no refund, nothing. I noticed when I got to the car that they threw in some spring rolls which appear to have pork in them which had spilled out of the box. I appreciate the gesture but all around bad experience, sloppy. Sandwich was not cut in half like it typically is. I am not super picky but this was very unlike this place, hoping they aren't getting too comfortable and just becoming sloppy. I will not likely be back.",

The bread is so crispy and gives a nice crunch in between each bite. I really liked the marinade on the grilled pork and how the pickled radishes and carrots gave a sweet hint. The cold cut was definitely a different taste but still enjoyable. There is plenty of seating inside and since it's in the heart of Ballantyne, there is a lot to do around. The next time I come back I'm going to check out the pho!",

Thankfully, service was super fast and super attentive - it felt more like sit-down restaurant service than fast casual restaurant service.  I made a game time decision to go for the combination bun ($11), which was vermicelli with grilled pork, shrimp, and fried egg rolls, and if I had had a bib and a ponytail holder, I would've embarrassed myself. I ate every.last.bite. My friend got the spicy pho ($12) and said it was amazing. At one point, she was looking around the restaurant, looking a little shifty/ uncomfortable, and I asked her if everything was okay. She said, \"I'm just trying to figure out proper etiquette on whether I can drink my broth and wondering if anyone in here would mind.\" Bwahaha.  Suffice it to say it's a good thing this place isn't closer to my house or I'd be as big as a house.",

The noodles are always well prepared, the veg is reasonably fresh, and the quantity of meat you get for the price is generous.  The broth is also pretty good, but it's a bit sweeter than I prefer.  Overall it's a quality meal and you'll definitely be full after.   For the bahn mi's, they were very solid as well. Tried the lemongrass one based on the other reviews on yelp, and it does not disappoint.  Overall, the place is a good spot to grab a reasonably priced meal, and it's local which is nice...because I'm lazy and I don't feel like driving across town for noodles.",

When we opened our to go box, they had pho toppings with half cooked meat and half RAW MEAT.  We asked them why the meat is raw and they said so that we can cook it when we got home. I've never heard of a restaurant putting raw meat in with your cooked ingredients so you can finish cooking it at home. I just want to reiderate that this RAW MEAT was placed ontop of our cooked noodles. The rest of the food we got was OK- but not even close to the hype of the reviews on this page.

It's really wonderful and it stores well in the fridge (uncooked) for 24 hours. The pork sandwich has fresh Cilantro and Cucumbers, which sounded strange at first but one taste and you will love it.

I had the bun bo Hue (spicy noodle soup), and my boyfriend had the bun thit nuong (grilled pork noodle dish).   Business was slow for a Friday night, but the owners seemed friendly.   The spicy noodle soup was disappointingly not spicy at all. The broth is not authentic-slight tomato-flavoured broth but tasted extremely diluted. Usually this kind of soup from Hue has an explosion of flavours. My boyfriend thought it tasted like a ketchup soup. However, he did enjoy his grilled pork noodles. They give a generous portion for a decent price.   Overall, we found the place a bit underwhelming. For the 35 min drive we took to get here, we wouldn't make the effort to come back.",

The Banh Mi sandwiches are my favorite--the meat is delicious, the vegetables are perfectly marinated, and the bread is fresh and divine!! I have always had to go to Central Avenue to have good, authentic food so it is nice to have a place in Ballantyne that is so good. Their menu is not as large as most restaurants but that is ok because they have perfected what they serve!!!!",

    "text": "Wow! This place is my new favorite place for Pho. Went tonight for dinner after the girls next door shared with me their menu during my pedicure.  The girl at the counter was super friendly and helped us decide what to order after we went back and forth with which Pho to try. We got the lemongrass pork belly skewers which were delicious and a perfect appetizer.  For dinner we both ordered the #11, meat Pho in a spicy beef broth.  It was out of this world! So flavorful and hearty.  The owner was so nice and brought out a complimentary bowl of the #9 (Pho with sliced filet mignon) after hearing us at the counter trying to decide which one sounded better. This one was delicious too, and how thoughtful to let us try it.  I'm so glad this is just up the street from my house, I will definitely be back, if not become a regular.  I suggest you take the advice of the other Yellpers and get over here soon! You won't be disappointed.",

The menu at Be Noodle and Banh Mi is very concise with just 20 items on the menu, focusing on Banh Mi sandwiches and Noodle dishes. On this visit I tried the Bun Thap Cam. The dish is a cold noodle like salad with hot meat toppings of grilled pork, shrimp and Vietnamese spring rolls. It also has a fish sauce dressing to go on top. The dish was very good. At first I thought there was no lettuce but it was hidden under the rice noodles.   The inside of Be's Noodle and Banh Mi is very dark and there are about 10 tables total. There's some classic Vietnamese artwork and some decor from the food/condiments that are close to the register.   I wasn't expecting much out of a Vietnamese restaurant in the Ballentyne area but I will definitely give them another try. The prices are reasonable and the flavor is good.

As noted recently with reviews of Le's and Banh Mi brothers, I've been on a Banh Mi kick (Crispy, you're next!) and the good news there is I've really enjoyed the sandwiches from each place.  Be's as the latest did not disappoint with this visit leading to a to-go order of a Lemongrass Grilled Pork sandwich which was served on a traditional baguette and stuffed with a good amount of flavorful meat and pickled veg.  I was really hungry and had to wolf it down quickly before a video meeting began but even the wolfing didn't take away from how much I enjoyed all the textures and flavors.  I look forward to trying some of their Bowls, Buns and such on future visits.",

It's fast casual and they were incredibly friendly and helpful. We ordered and found a table where our food arrived pretty quickly.   Three of us split the lemongrass pork banh mi, the filet pho, and the combo vermicelli bowl. Everything was delicious. The pork was so flavorful on the banh mi, so it was probably my favorite. The pho was one of the best I've had. I love vermicelli bowls and this one didn't disappoint.   The food is all reasonably priced, but it doesn't come with a side, so you may want to get an appetizer as well.   This place is definitely worth checking out for great Vietnamese food!",

It was a lot longer than I had imagined (boyfriend had ordered it for me, but apparently the menu says they are 10\"), but no complaints with that! The veggies had a nice crunch, and the meat was thinly sliced. The meat actually reminded me of luncheon meat. I would have like the bread to have more crunch. I think I've been spoiled by the bahn mi from California because it's been hard to find good bahn mi. This place wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing to me either. I also had their spring rolls ($5 for 2 rolls), and again, not bad, but not something I would be excited to order again from here.",

Quite simply, everything that it serves up is absolutely PHOnominal, however, the Banh Mi is totally off the charts. The bread is crusty and fresh, and the mix of lemongrass chicken, cilantro, cukes and (beware) jalapenos create a symphony of flavor in your mouth. At $8, it is also a great deal!  The Pho is equally outstanding and on this cold, wet Monday, it seemed that a gigantic bowl of such occupied most every diner's table (which, btw were all taken when we arrived.) It starts at $12 and easily serves two; in fact, for most  couples, canoodling over a bowl of it while splitting a Banh Mi is the perfect way to enjoy a meal, especially on a day like today.  Rounding things out, the service is friendly and attentive, and everything is very clean (in spite of a somewhat disappointing 93.5 sanitary score.) Still, it's a Gotta Try in my book!",

I got the lemon grass grilled pork. The sauce on it was very good and it ranks pretty high on my list. I ate every bite and left feeling very happy. My wife got the Combo Pho and she said it was just okay and that she's had better.   Being that I live on the other side of town, I wouldn't drive that far when I have other options closer. But I would still recommend this place to anyone in that area. Next time I am near there, I want to try one of the rice dishes.",

Everyone is very attentive, the cashier offered helped with anything in the menu.  It was busy instead, yet there was plenty of seating and food came hot and fast! I was beyond happy that my friend liked because we love trying new Asian spots.   They only have one size option, but it's perfect price for the size and they give you plentiful!

They are experiment crispy and packed full with a mix of meat and veggies. Every flavor full and tasty. I would have ordered more if they were not priced so high. $5 for three egg rolls, I think is a little pricey for the amount you get. The quality is spot on though.",

These Vietnamese sandwiches are amazing and have swept my heart vicariously to a Vietnamese cuisine.  Can't wait till I'm back in the Ballantyne area to get on some more of the banh mi action.",

Their pho is absolutely delicious and broth is extra savory. It is very authentic. The prices can't be beat either. Their banh mi sandwiches are excellent and the bread they use is so good. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. All appetizers are great, vermicelli bowls are nice and big. Good sized portions with a nice price tag. Their cashiers and wait staff always do a stellar job. There has never been a time where I have walked out with a frown. If you live in the area it's an excellent quick bite and even if you live a little further away it is worth the drive!",

You order at the counter, get your drinks and they bring food to you.  I had the combo vermicelli....was delicious!!! Spring rolls were perfectly done and well presented with dipping sauce.  Also got the crispy spring rolls...fried a bit to long but still tasty.  Ordered the iced coffee...very strong and needed more water...was VERY sweet!  Will let ice melt and add water at home and sip all day!!! My daughter got the chicken Pho...was a delicious broth with lots of chicken and noodles.  My other daughter got the chicken curry...spicy and tasty with rice.  My grand daughter got the grilled pork rice plate. It was good but was a bitover salted.  It could have used a bit more daikon and pickled carrots to help with flavor. All in all I think a solid 4 1/2 stars...I gave 5 as the waitstaff was amazing!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!",

The third time I went here the owner has been so kind to let us stay here a little longer after our long road trip. I tried their Bun Bo Hue and it was phenomenal. I grew up eating Vietnamese food all of the time and I've always preferred home cooked meals then going out to Vietnamese restaurants. I was impressed with the flavors in the Bun Bo Hue, however it did had a little kick. If you don't like spicy, I highly not recommend this.

    "text": "UPDATE: After coming back here multiple times, this has probably become one of my favorite (if not my favorite) restaurants in Ballantyne.  My favorite dish? The lemongrass grilled pork vermicelli bowl. The pork is sooo tender yet flavorful and I love the ample pickled veggies and lettuce that it comes with. The fish sauce adds just the right amount of flavor so that the entire bowl comes together flawlessly.  Along those lines, the grilled pork bahn mi is also very good. Very flavorful from the pork and the cilantro / pickled veggies / sauce come together very well.  I also tried the grilled chicken vermicelli and was disappointed since the chicken was a tad bit too dry. Stick with the pork. You won't be disappointed.  PSA: If you get the pho to go, make sure you have a big bowl at home, less than 5 min away. The beef fillet is provided to you in its raw form, meant to get cooked in the broth right before you eat, but if you let the broth cool down, you'll have to heat it back up to fully cook through the beef. Also you won't be able to eat all the contents unless you have a massive bowl to dump everything in. So maybe just don't get it to go and eat in the restaurant. Or get the pork.  ----  4 stars for the pho.   Specifically the broth, which is full bodied and rich and delicious. Apparently, Be starts stewing the broth a day in advance with real bones, which is what gives the broth its rich flavor. Whatever magic they are doing, the broth is delicious. The rice noodles are fine and the meat in the combination pho was good (although not the best I've had), but the real winner is the broth. Also the prices are super reasonable given the large portion sizes (I had difficulty finishing my bowl).   Still have to come back and try the banh mi!",

Shawn and John made it much more of an experience at Be's, rather than just dinner. As well as we're so kind to explain each item and what it was prepared with. My husband and now have since brought our family and will continue to go often! We couldn't recommend this place anymore if you like Vietnamese, which if you have never had it like me I highly recommend you giving it a try!",

I haven't tried to banh mi here but my Vietnamese friend said it's no good (they don't have pickled veggies). It's quite pricy than other places I've been too for better food so unless I'm too lazy to do the drive to another I wouldn't order here. I gave it three stars because the pho was pretty good to go, staff was very friendly, and technology was more updated than other Viet places I've been to.",

We couldn't decide between the spicy beef pho or the filet mignon pho but both of us decided on the spicy beef which was definitely the best we've had in Charlotte...even enjoyed it more than Viet Thai, which we love.   The service was so friendly and attentive and the lady who owns the place was sweet enough to give us a sample of the filet mignon pho since we had such a hard time choosing between that and the spicy beef. That too was delicious but a bit less on the savory /richness side (probably because of the beef shank in the spicy beef pho) but was delicious as well... Either tasted wonderful, just more of a personal preference on which one to get.   We will definitely be back to eat there again!",

You have to order some of their pork belly. I actually recommend getting 2 orders of it, it's so good! Two skewers of pork belly come in an order. I just wish that they were a bit bigger in portion, hence asking for 2 orders. The pho, oh the pho! Very simple, and delicious. We both ordered the combination and it did not disappoint! Delicious broth that doesn't middle the flavors of the meats in the soup. They gave me extra meatballs in mine since I didn't want the brisket. The portions are very generous and next time we will share a bowl of pho so that we can order a bahn mi and a bun bowl which looked delicious. Cannot wait to go back!",

I ordered the combo vermicelli (subbed lemongrass chicken for the pork) and spring rolls. It is a plenty for me to nosh on for at least another meal. Everything was absolutely delicious. The chicken in particular was incredibly flavorful and moist (I hate that word but that is the best way to describe it). The customer service was welcoming and not over the top. I called ahead of time and my order was ready within about 2 minutes of me walking in the door.   The price was a bit hefty ($12 for the vermicelli, $5 for the spring rolls) but again, the portions were extremely generous. I can't wait to come back to this place to try out the sandwiches and pho.

Today, that changed when I tried Be's Noodles in Ballantyne which just opened 2 days ago. The pho at Be's is delicious and flavorful and reminds me of home. The broth is prepared from beef bones, not powders or pastes. I also had the spring rolls which are excellent and made with care. The thai basil, jalepeno and bean sprout condiments at Be's are plentiful and fresh. The interior of this brand new restaurant is bright and welcoming. I look forward to many hot bowls of pho coming out of Be's kitchen.",

    "text": "I just returned from a trip to Be's Noodles and Banh Mi. I eat here probably three times a month as I work across the street. Unfortunately, today was my last visit. I sat at the counter and ordered the grilled pork rice plate  as I always do, which is quite flavorful.      What happened next is enough for me to never return. I watched the cook remove a pork chop from the grill (presumably mine) in order to plate it and witnessed it fall on the floor. The cook then picked it up off the floor with the tongs he was cooking with and proceeded to place it back on the grill! I managed to make eye contact with him and he knew immediately that I was horrified. He then moved it off the grill, with the still dirty tongs and placed it in the drip tray of the grill. I brought this to the attention of my server, who sent over another employee to talk to me. She stated she was the \"foodsafe\" employee for the restaurant. She advised me that she feels she \"isn't in the restaurant often enough\".       Throughout this ordeal, no one had moved the previously fallen pork chop from the drip tray. I am completely convinced that someone else will receive this pork chop on their plate at some point today. I am no expert on food safety, but I would think the appropriate way to handle this would have been to pick up the fallen pork chop (with a napkin or other disposable item) as not to contaminate anything else and then throw it out. Instead, the tongs touched the floor and were continued to be used even after I voiced concern about this.      After having witnessed this, I took note of the personnel working in the kitchen and noticed, none were wearing hairnets. I may be nit-picky, but after having seen what I saw, this gave me an even more uneasy feeling, yet for some reason I wound up staying.      I am not one to bash a restaurant intentionally, but I feel that in this situation, no attempt was made to conserve me as a customer or apologize for the behavior. It seems more like they were sorry they got caught than sorry for breaking food safety protocol. No apology was issued on behalf of anyone at the restaurant. It was more like they thanked me for bringing it to their attention.",

My husband loves the Pho (noodle soup cooked with fresh veggies and served with herbs and more veggies on the side, like fresh, crispy bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil leaves still on the stem and more...) We were so impressed with the food and service on our first visit, that we couldn't wait to return. Second visit; same fresh food, happy young woman/owner greeting us and happy servers!  I love the lemongrass chicken rice plate! You can actually taste the lemon oil in the lemon grass, and the fresh snow peas crunch in your mouth, followed by the most amazing white rice I've ever tasted. Some hoisin and siracha sauces on the side only add to the scrumptious flavors. This is a very casual, \"order at the counter\" restaurant, but every table has fresh roses! They seem to reflect the whole experience of this cute place that is fresh, pleasant, lovely and delicious",

I had the combo BUN and like another reviewer said, probably the best BUN I've had. My hubs had the curry chicken which was loaded with chicken. The sauce was a slightly Spicey and smooth. They even give you some Bread if you want to dip it into the Curry. The staff is attentive and friendly. If there was a downside, I would say the menu is a bit limited. But we will definitely be back.",

Mind you the menu is small but what was available was outstanding.  The Ph... any Vietnamese restaurant can call itself Vietnamese if the Ph is not good.  The Ph here is amazing.. almost as good as my mum's.  But personally the best soup on the menu is the Bun bo Hu. It is a spicy beef soup that is to die for.  AMAZING! a must if you want to try to authentic Vietnamese soup.  There Gi cun or Fresh rolls are great to.    I am a total fan.",

It really was wonderful - huge portions, exceptionally fresh ingredients, great pho (beef), lemongrass chicken with noodles and spring rolls - the perfect takeout for football and granddaughter watching!!  Back in Charlotte for granddaughter watching in early June, and eats at Be's was mandatory ... still wonderfully fresh & delicious ... Can I give em 10 stars for the great eats (lemongrass chicken with noodles & sauce, and spring rolls) tonight that we took in while our daughter and son-in-law went to a concert ... What's wrong with this picture? ... NOTHING! ... Be's plus babes, PERFECT!!",

For example, they no longer serve their lemongrass pork belly, and have cut back on the amount of sprouts, basil, and lime they serve with their pho. And their diet coke always has a slightly moldy after taste. I was so excited when they first opened, because they were really GOOD then, but I probably will not go back now.",

The young lady behind the register informed me they will no longer be selling kids bowls to adults. Ok, that's fine but maybe give an option of no meat and different sizes???",
