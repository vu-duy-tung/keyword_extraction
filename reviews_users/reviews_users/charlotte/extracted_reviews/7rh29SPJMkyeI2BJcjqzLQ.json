However, you walk in here and it is so impeccably clean. It seems to be a nice family owned business. The service is fantastic. The hot tea is freshly made with herbs and steeped...Delicious. Only $1.75 and they bring a nice little pot enough to share. The prices are incredible. $8.95 got me a Sa Cha Chicken with fried rice, soup, and egg roll. This is \"old school\" nothing fancy. No fancy pricing! They even have coupons out! My new favorite place. Also, a perk I enjoy....On these freezing cold nights you can easily park right at the door!!!! Looks like they do a lot of take out.",

Yeah we thought it would be just like the rest but we stop anyways. Once we got in there I felt like it was perfect. The atompshere was awesome, the people was very friendly, and the space for seating was amazing. I was very SURPRISE! The decor was well thought out and was very modern.   Once we got our food, it was incredible. Food wasn't greasy or oily and as very healthy. I recommend this resturant for all who like chinese or any other asian dish.",

Mine usually lasts me at least 2 days- that is, if I don't end up eating the leftovers the same night. (How do you distinguish between eating leftovers, and just taking a breather? How much time needs to pass between meals?)  I also, as a general hater of restaurant websites, find their website pleasantly well-organized and informative. Hours, location, menu, types of payment, tasty pictures of food, and printable coupons. Winning. They do deliver, but since I can see their building from my front door, I pick up. It's about a 7-minute walk and they always have my food ready to go by the time I get there. The only down side is I can't eat my egg drop soup on my 7-minute walk back home.",

After looking at the menu, we realized we could still get the lunch special (which comes with eggroll) and decided to order some appetizers. Super pumped it would be ready in under 15 minutes, but everything kinda dwindled after that.  We both got a chicken & veg dish (moo goo gai pan and chow mein), but since the only starch in either was fried rice, the only difference between ours was the vegetable selection. Yes, the sauce tasted exactly the same, like thickened water with a touch of chicken flavour. We also ordered the steamed dumplings, which were good but the top to the sauce wasn't put on all the way so we were forced to eat them dripping in pure soy and sodium. We also ordered a salad with ginger dressing (I know, I know, from a chinese restaurant) but the \"dressing\" was so thick it was just like eating shredded marinated ginger on lettuce. You win some, you lose some. And the eggrolls were HT freezer section material, definitely could go without next time.  I know we didn't chose heavily fried and sauced items that usually can't be messed up, but a good Chinese restaurant knows how to infuse flavors into even its lighter dishes, and that wasn't the case here.",

If I had been dining in and had been served this? I would have sent it back and complained- a lot.  I got the Tofu w. vegetable. The tofu was sort of just added to the sauce (not prepared with it) and the vegetables added were literally the \"peas and carrots\" you'd find in the frozen section of a grocery store. Cubed carrots and strange textured peas. The sauce even had a strange texture to it. And then the duck sauce that was added to the bag was expired.   Awful x 2. I definitely recommend looking elsewhere.",

First, I don't really like to eat MSG-ridden Chinese food.  Electric red sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken have never interested me.  Second, the look of the place kinda freaked me out.  But when the lady wants hot and sour soup and the fridge is lacking hot and sour soup, I can and will become interested in Bei Jing.    Hot and spicy soup.  Delicious.  Wonton (I nearly typed wanton, which is something altogether different) soup.  Delicious.  Pork dumplings.  Pretty delicious.  Chicken fried rice.  Simple and pretty delicious.  Unlike most other fried rice, there was not a bag of frozen peas and carrots thrown in this rice.  And it was all quite cheap.    Will I eat here again?  Yes.  Will it be soon?  No.  Will I ever eat General Tso's chicken or chicken that looks like it has been dipped in cherry compote?  No.  Is Beijing one word or two?

I ordered the Sesame chicken (extra crispy) and was pleasantly surprised that for 8 and change you receive a generous portion of chicken, fried rice, egg roll, choice of soup - I went won-ton, and even a little steamed broccoli. Ho ho cherry house doesn't offer soup or broccoli- so I was really pleased.  My order took only 10 minutes - and it tasted cook-to-order.   I really enjoyed their egg-roll's - definitely better than Ho-Ho's.They use more than just cabbage which is key. The rice was tasty- and the soup was awesome! I actually gave some to the girls that I was babysitting and lets say Ive never seen a 4 year old  down won-ton soup broth versus the chocolate ice cream in front of her!   Where they fell off the wagon was the crispiness factor. Unfortunately, that is kind of my main test for Chinese and the chicken just wasn't crispy at all. I would hate to see what it would be like if I didn't order extra crispy- it would have been mush! I also didn't care for the sauce as much as Ho-Ho's.  The sides were all cooked so well- and you can't beat the price or the location so I think id try it again and really stress the EXTRA crispy part!",

    "text": "I was so hopeful when taking a job a couple of years ago and also living very close to this place and have visited this restaurant about 8 times in the 2 years. Disappointed each and every time. I love egg fu young and the first time I got it was decent for a fast food style chinese restaurant. The next 2 times was terrible. Burned on the outside, dry on the inside and the gravy had the consistency of peanut butter. Sweet and sour pork is just ok, more breading than pork, sesame chicken was bland and overcooked.   My last visit on 1/28 was perhaps the most disappointing of all. I walked in to order take out. I ordered sweet and sour pork and vegetable lomein. Got my order and got home to find vegetable fried rice instead. First let me say they do not seem to use regular rice, it's more like instant rice in all their dishes. I have never gotten anything with actual fresh vegetables, the have to be either frozen out of a bag or come from a can. The only difference in the vegetable fried rice is they add some soggy broccoli and and those little corn cobs out of a can. Otherwise it was simply a big pile of fried rice.   The only thing consistent about this place is that the portions are large and it's cheap if that's your thing. To me cheap and quantity is still a waste of money if it is not good. I will not go back and it's a shame because it is convenient to me. Instead I'll pay a little more and get fresh Chinese/Asian food from one of the Asian fusion places in Uptown.",

    "text": "When the fridge is bare and we're not in the mood for pizza, hubs and I typically scan the Chinese restaurant menus. Since we're just around the corner from Beijing, we thought we'd give it a solid, college try.   We looked up their website (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beijingcharlotte.com&s=4f1de295c4383f0a02785f6ff6152635f29d320508b86e36b952fb2d9afca7eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">beijingcharlotte.com</a>) and were pleasantly surprised that their menu was available online. We scanned through and ordered the Crab Rangoon, General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice and Beef w/Mixed Vegetables. What can I say, our fridge was reeeaaallly bare, we wanted leftovers! I wish their website offered dish descriptions of each item. It would be helpful to know what exactly composes Schezwuan Beef.   Hubs went to pick it up, as they do not have delivery service as of yet. A local food review mentioned that they were hoping to add that service in the near future. While I didn't pick up the food, hubs said that the place was decent inside. Nothing crazy, but a comfortable spot to stop for some quick food. Our food was ready in ten minutes - nice!   Once our Chinese feast was brought home I tasted each dish. The General Tso's was my favorite of all the dishes. It's not the healthiest menu item, but the chicken had a well-spiced sauce on it and it wasn't heavily breaded. I could have handled more heat, though. The shrimp fried rice was just ok, I was expecting more veggies and egg within the dish. It was mostly shrimp, fried rice and chopped onions. The crab rangoon was quite tasty but the beef with mixed vegetables was fairly bland.   I don't want to write off this place just yet, as their dishes were prepared fresh and none were greasy at all. I think I'll try a few new items next time and maybe ask for a bit more heat in my dish.",

We sat down and started looking at the menu and again, waited for the guy to come back and get our drink order.

If it has Bok Choy, Mmmm I do not need any more persuasion...  Asking about this one, my Waitress offered (without me asking) \"this one has Black Beans\"!  Hunan Beef Please!  The Beef was good, I do not know how they cooked it, I'm guessing a lot, though it was not over cooked, it was a preparation I have little experience with.  I got them to leave out the vegetables I do not like (broccoli and snow peas) and yeas it had Bok Choy... The vegetables were Very CRISP, unlike so many places, these were perfectly cooked!  The flavor of the Hunan Sauce was very good, not great, though it beats most places for this dish!   The service was very good!  My Waitress asked How i liked everything and I told her I did and she said \"but will you come back?\" I said \"probably not\"... Only because I would rather have Vietnamese, Thai or Korean (in that order) if it is Asian themed food!  For Chinese I'm giving them 4.45 stars because they are better than almost all Chinese places I have eaten!  Of  course I enjoy Vietnamese, Thai and Korean more, though I do not believe it is fair to compare!  For the price this place gets close to 5 yelp stars for Lunch!",

We'd tried several others in our search for quick takeout Chinese food restaurant and once we found Beijing, we stopped looking. I love that they have dinner specials that include an eggroll, soup and fried rice, most places only offer those during lunch.   So far everything we've ordered has been great - wonton soup, pork with garlic sauce, lo mein, sesame chicken, chicken with vegetables, shrimp with garlic sauce (HUGE shrimp - not the tiny little shrimp you get at some other places), beef with broccoli - to name a few. This may seem really trivial, but we love their eggrolls. We moved to Houston for 4 years and couldn't find decent eggrolls anywhere (we like the softer skinned, \"bumpy\" ones vs. the hard, thin-skinned, overfried small eggrolls.) I will say their wonton soup broth is extremely brown, which was off-putting the first time, but it's delicious.  I also like that they have a website, I always find myself losing paper menus so it's convenient to be able to look it up on my phone and call in a to-go order.",

After many failed attempts with Chinese take our in Charlotte, I visited Bei Jing for take out and will be paying them more visits in the future.   Not only do they have a huge menu with standard items plus some I've never heard of but they also offer lunch specials every day (dine in or to go). Another thing I like is they offer dinner specials that won't clear out your wallet and with that you get the entree, fried rice, eggroll AND your choice of soup. And the entree comes in a snazzy, durable container that will bring me more use in the future. I got the sesame chicken dinner and loved that it came with fresh veggies (I am using the plural loosely as it was only two pieces of broccoli but don't mind because it was so green and fresh and not drowning in sauce). The egg roll was a mini eggroll but really, after all that food, I don't need an eggroll on steroids. The hot and sour soup was standard but it seemed spicier than other places and left my nostrils clear and pleased. The dinner portion was huge which left half for me to enjoy later. The cherry on the sundae was my fortune, I usually get a crappy, transparent fortune and for once, got something that actually made a little sense.  An array of menu items+ generous portions +tasty food+ quick service = a happy, full me.",

We have finally found it in Beijing Chinese Cuisine.  My wife ordered the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce and I had the General Tso's chicken - unimaginative, I know, but it's my first time and I wanted to scale this with something with which I was already familiar. This was literally one of the best General Tso chicken dishes I had ever had -- every morsel was cooked to perfection. My wife's Shrimp with Lobster Sauce was just as excellent. She ate every bit, and this is from someone who normally carries half of her meal home for later. Yes, it was that good.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The place is small, but neat, just outside of Uptown Charlotte on South Blvd. We were seated near the window so we had the added amenity of seeing the uptown traffic and the people walking by. A large-screen TV was tuned to a kids' movie, which was somewhat distracting, but not badly so.  We are definitely planning a return visit to Beijing Chinese within the very near future.This experience was worth the 12-mile drive from south Charlotte.",

We went in for lunch and had a good experience...so we came back a number of times. Now it's time for me to give them props :)  The restaurant is very clean and well lit. When we've gone there (usually at lunch time it isn't super busy) and we've gotten great service. Very attentive. They seem to get a ton of business from takeout orders. I give a lot of credit to the servers because from what I've seen they're responsible for guests dining in and dealing with phone/takeout orders. Not easy to do. In any event the service has always been great.  The food...To be honest I can't really speak on their selection. I haven't really perused the menu too much. The lunch specials have been too appealing to look beyond them. I've tried a couple of things on the lunch specials menu and they have yet to disappoint. Not only were they good entrees, but the portions are big and they come with choice of Rice, choice of soup and an egg roll. I know that it's not uncommon for Chinese restaurants to have lunch specials which include those things, but it's always nice to get value for your $$$. Good food + good portions + sides for a low price = great deal.   Now to be fair, the food doesn't blow me away. It's good, and it's better than mall food court asian food in terms of quality of ingredients and taste, but doesn't necessarily stand out compared to other traditional sit-down Chinese places that I've tried. But I've always had a good overall dining experience there and the food is always meets my expectations. It never disappoints. If I could I'd give it a 3.5   I've done carry out from them as well. No complaints there either. I fully expect to eat there again.",

So I took a gamble and tried Beijing.  The lunch price was just $7 or so which included an unimpressive spring roll that left grease on the tongue, brownish rice (I suspect it was not actually brown grain rice but soy colored rice) and a fatty beef with broccoli in a slimy thick sauce with too much thickener and fake (canned) garlic taste and other fake flavors. Oh man... It left me unsatisfied and disappointed. I should have known I couldn't scratch the itch to have good Chinese in anemic Charlotte. One thing I miss terribly about California is truly good authentic Chinese and Mexican. So I guess I'll stick with sushi, Thai and Vietnamese. But I digress...  Now I know better than to eat at Beijing again (though they have a convenient location and wicked fast service.

So, driving home Friday night I spotted Beijing. Got home, checked out the menu and called for pickup. I ordered the Shrimp with broccoli dinner special which includes rice, egg roll, and your choice of soup. I chose the spring roll and wonton soup. I was quoted 15 minutes and when I arrived my order was ready. And, there were multiple people picking up orders as well as diners in the restaurant. A good sign in my mind, not! The wonton soup was brown, see photo. Never having seen a brown soup I was a little nervous and I was right, nasty taste. The rice was so blah and the shrimp and broccoli was covered in a thick brown sauce that has a horrible taste and the shrimp tasted very fishy. As for the spring roll, pure grease. All I will say is the fortune cookie was the only thing about the meal I enjoyed. I will definitely not be back. Bummer, because it is convenient to me.",

There was a decent selection of items and combinations on the menu.  We ordered the chicken fried rice and chicken and shrimp egg foo yung. I was a bit turned off by the impatience of the man taking our order at the register as he didn't seem to like that we asked him to re-confirm that the chicken fried rice has onions but no other vegetables (peas, carrots, etc.), yet the \"free\" friend rice that he offered with our egg foo yung does have vegetables.  He dropped his head and stopped talking like we were slow. WTH?!  Then says \"I try to be nice so I offer the fried rice).  I started to walk out, but didn't.  In any event, our food was bagged with the patties separate from the gravy, and two additional containers with the two fried rice. There was also a greasy looking fortune cookie in the bag. Upon serving the food, the chicken in the chicken fried rice appeared to be barely cooked side. I braved it out and it tasted ok (I'll follow up with an update if I get sick :) ) The egg foo yung patties were rather tasteless and the accompanying gravy tasted like canned beef gravy - not good.  The \"free\" fried rice actually tasted pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend this place and definitely will not be going back.",

This is easily the best chinese food place in South End (though perhaps the only one).  Prices are reasonable, food is good, and service is quick, whether you dine in or take-out.

The atmosphere is open and moderately, yet nicely decorated. I'm sure that being a new restaurant they are still working on making it a more warm space. Depending on the time you go, the windows are not shaded so you'll get the sun right in your face. In addition, as we were eating there was just something out of place. It hit me! There was no ambiance music; however, they do have a tv on the wall.   The food was good, not greasy or oily. The vegetables were fresh! The portion size was good. Service was friendly. They offer take-out and it seemed like that was the popular choice the night we went.   It's a nice little addition in South End!",

Food: I've only had a few dishes, but they were all slightly above average. Nothing terrible, but nothing note worthy. The shrimp with mixed vegetables and garlic sauce is my favorite. I get it as the lunch combo ($8.50), with fried rice and a shrimp egg roll. Food usually comes out quick and piping hot.   Service: Meh. As basic as it gets.

I've had the sesame chicken (not too crunchy and great flavor), chicken and broccoli (chicken was cooked well but could a touch more flavor), and my fiance always gets the scallion chicken (a tad spicy, I think, but great flavor!). The rice is great and not dry! Egg rolls are good and so is the wonton soup. The prices are extremely reasonable (under $10 for the dinner combo as of 5/4/18) for the location.   If you go in and order take out they are pretty fast. I think we waited maybe 8-10 minutes. Definitely worth the trip!

    "text": "The go to place to get a quick bite of Chinese food in Southend. Call ahead or take a break inside the comfortable yet simple dining room. If you're on the run it is super easy to call ahead and pick it up.   Service is solid and we had no issues! The restaurant was clean and mostly empty. While we were eating there were probably 5 or 6 to go orders that came and went while we were dining. So I would say most of their business is carry out.   The soup was great. I tried both the wonton and onion soup and they were tasty to the last drop. The crab rangoons were phenomenal. A must try! They do extremely well when folding and making them! As for their entrees I was once again pleased with my choice. If you come in here and try something new that you don't know and it's not tasty to you that is not their issue. If you order something you don't like that shouldn't effect the rating you give them on Yelp!! Always best to get a description before blindly ordering something.",

    "text": "The taste is ok.  I did not like the chicken being deep fried and drenched with some kind of sauce, it was too oily and I did not feel good about the chicken as such.  The quantity was huge, but the quality was only ok. I had the Sesame Chicken and wife got a General Tso chicken - the verdict from both of us was same.  We  have had better!! It came with broccoli and white rice.  I was expecting fried rice though, but did not check when picking up the order and also it was closing time.  anyways, I really did not feel healthy about it, something was off.",

They were 100% right and we loved our veggie lo Mein, veggie delight with fried rice, and two spring rolls, all for under $25 including tip and tax! And The wait was 10 min or less to get our food. This is officially our new favorite Chinese place!!",

    "text": "After living in South End for almost a year, my wife & I finally decided to give our neighborhood Chinese joint some love. I'm glad we did.  We placed an order for takeout, in the restaurant, which was ready in about 10 minutes. Our order consisted off: egg drop soup, egg rolls, chicken & broccoli with fried rice & scallion chicken with lo-mien noodles. The egg drop was about average, I'd say --- I've definitely had better but I wouldn't hesitate to order theirs again. Egg rolls were pretty substantial and had a good taste to the filling. The brown sauce on the chicken & broccoli was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. My only complaint would be to maybe throw in a little more chicken & a little less broccoli. The scallion chicken, for me, was the showcase winner of the night. It wasn't your typically chewy/breaded mess that is Chinese fried chicken. This was lightly breaded white meat and had an amazing sauce to it. The le-mein were good, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $1.50 upgrade again to get it over the fried rice.  Overall, this place is a solid option for your Chinese cravings. The chicken dinner combinations (soup, egg roll, entree & rice) range from $8.95-$9.50 or so. Well worth the price.",

    "text": "Yummy! Being from NY I've had a hard time finding Chinese food down here that matches NY. I feel like I say that all the time, it's so hard not to compare everything to home! But I finally found a good place and it's super close to my apartment which is a big plus too!   I've been here a few times now and have gotten different things. The first time I got sweet and sour chicken...you can never go wrong with it! It was so good, crispy and crunchy and perfect with the sweet and sour sauce. The next time we got sesame chicken, again really good! Crunchy and just the right amount of sauce. I hate when Chinese places drench the chicken in sauce. It ruins it! All the sides were good too, egg rolls, fried rice, and wonton soup. Their wonton soup is made from scratch and delicious! The lo mein was just okay, maybe it was just this time but it was a little too greasy for my taste.   I can't wait for the next Saturday night movie night and Chinese food!",

They aren't super busy all the time, but the staff are super friendly and I have not had a bad dish/order here at all.  There's a large dining room that is neat and orderly and the food often comes out super quick.  Being off of South Blvd, they have a small parking lot to the side and back - but you can't ask for a better location.  There menu is pretty extensive. The usual favorites you will find at other Chinese places but they also have some \"chef specials\".  Solid take out experience here too. They will include the utensils and napkins if you forget to pick some up on the way out.  Very efficient brown paper bag packaging and clear order receipt stapled on the top of the bag to eliminate any confusion.",

I commend his ability to remain calm, cool, and collected despite many growing impatient including the table of 5 next to us. Our food came out pretty quickly since we came in right before the rush. We got 2 lunch specials which came with an egg roll and fried rice: shrimp with mixed veggies and chicken lo mein. It was basic Americanized Chinese fare which is exactly the description that accompanies it when you do a google search. Don't expect frills or anything gourmet to come out. This place is definitely the place to go in you don't want to venture out of South End and are craving basic Chinese takeout.",
