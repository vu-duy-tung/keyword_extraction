McD, KFC and all them other place, needs to come here and take a look.  This place does very simple things to make the entire experience good.   Like every CFA , the lunch crowd descends upon the drive thru, and this place is smart enough to have 2 workers come outside and take orders.  Thus shortening the line and expediting the delivery of food.  Simple, helpful and profitable..",

Yea its a notch pricey-er than your standard fast food spot (esp. their breakfast) , but the TASTE and Quality are a notch above your standard fast food fare as well.  The chicken-tenders are awesome.  The milkshakes (STRAWBERRY) are amazing.  I'm a huge fan of the chicken breakfast burrito and the CHICKEN MINIS    ...and always remember; Chick-Fil-A is ALWAYS CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!",

The food is one of the best delicious fast food I've ever tasted. The cookies and cream shake is the best shake in Charlotte. In fact, I will boldly say the BEST SHAKE I'VE EVER TASTED.  I was on a lunch date there and when we finished eating, a older lady worker willingly took our tray full of trash and cleared the table for us. And she had a smile on her face...I thought I was dreaming. I almost slapped myself to make sure I was awake!   Overall, one of the best, if not the best fast food restaurants in the university area of Charlotte. I recommend taking everyone there, especially those who are visitors in Charlotte.  5 STARS because it deserves it for it's awesome delicious food and incredible customer service. Thank you for hiring the RIGHT people and training them well. C-F-A has integrity and consistency. Which makes a great experience on every visit.",

I ordered a meal and a milkshake and was told I would need to pull up a little to wait on my milkshake. I begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm. The milk shake was taking long so I begin eating my room temp nuggets. I'm not the type of person to send back food if I don't find if hot enough so I suck it up and eat it and wait for my shake. About 7minutes later I send the boyfriend in to get my milkshake and they told him that they thought we drove off so it was just sitting there and they didn't even remake it. Of course it was milky and melted. I've given up on most fast food places in the University Area because of awful service and quality and it looks Chick Fil A will be added to the list.",

Perhaps there may be too many people working at one time, but it works because service is always prompt and courteous.  Thank you Chick-Fil-A for having a restaurant location I can aways count on to make me feel wecomed.  I have to agree with Chad E.

Everything went well up until I retuned to work and realized they forgot the Cobb salad I had ordered.  I returned back to the location and let them know the salad was missed.

We got the spicy chicken sandwich with fries. It was delicious but curious to what had happened to the lettuce and tomato and a beat up bun. The meat was delicious and a pickle to add a kick to the sandwich. But nothing that I will crave and order again.  The fries was quite amazing and cut into waffles shape. It wasn't nothing special but the waffle shape added volume and crunch.  Would I come back...I don't think so. But for those who wants to try. The service in this location is top notch and very kind and accommodating. The place is clean and well kept, they were quick with the orders from the drive thru and line up inside. So keep up the good job, but need a better presentation of food to get returning customers.",

You have to love the idea that there is luxury in every bite, I mean it's a darn good sandwich.    I live in Seattle, we have no Chick-Fil-A... we don't get to taste this wonderful delight, that make people line up in cars, bleeding into parking lot of the neighboring Office Depot, blocking traffic, and generally proving that if you are hungry, there is no good reason to go anywhere else, because you have it right here.   Take the Deluxe Chick-Fil-A sandwich.   The juicy chicken meat is cooked perfectly, in a light batter, and with cheese, lettuce, tomato... you can't best this simplicity, or the flavor; why would you want to go anywhere else for lunch.  You get some darn good waffle fries, and a soda.  Sure, it's not the healthiest thing out there, but sure beats any burger, in terms of what a good lunch seems, but it won't leave you moody or in a coma.   Here's where we are, you want to be here, simple, because it's good tasting fast food.",

That being said, I tend to hit up this location pre-Monday-beer binge and I am honestly always so taken aback by how courteous, fast, and just in a good mood everyone that works here is!  Whether I walk in because the drive-thru is a hot mess or go through said drive-thru (aka the Hot Mess Express...navigating in and out of the drive-thru lane/prkg lot will make u religious real quick...), I'm always greeted w/a smile and my order is brought out so fast, exactly as ordered! And, I don't know what it is about their \"my pleasure\" reply rather than \"you're welcome\" that just makes me automatically smile back!  I did used to cringe when the drive-thru attendants would say \"have a blessed day\" because it felt like they were forcing something on me that I didn't want. But, after tonight while talking w/one of the attendants (the line was unusually backed up) I asked if they were required to say \"have a blessed day\", she said she wasn't sure, but she says it because she feels so blessed everyday and she hopes that by sharing her blessed mentality it helps others feel the same. That got me, right in the feels!  So, while CFA is my once in awhile \"guilty\" pleasure, I will say that whenever I need a quick fix and my frown turned upside down, I come in for an 8 ct of \"blessings\" with extra Polynesian & honey mustard.",

I called the location and Alan( I think) and Caleb  answered the phone at the same time. I informed them about the issue. They asked if I could return. I told them I could but breakfast will be over by then. He offered to send me a coupon in the mail.  I still think the eclipse messed up something.

    "text": "I love Chick-fil-A. The food is amazing and the service is almost always amazing. The only problem I have with this location is the NEVER check their mobile orders. Every time I try to order out of convenience they always say they didn't realize they had a mobile order and I end up waiting for my food just as long as I would have waited doing a regular order for when in a time crunch. Check your mobile orders!",

And of course customer service is always top notch, not once have I been to a Chick-fil-A that I had a bad experience even if it's one out of town. Food is always hot and fresh and a happy smiling employee is there to greet you. The app invention is the best thing in the world in my opinion, always some nice freebies loaded on there just because :-)",

    "text": "Almost every time I come to this location, it's slammed regardless of the time of day. Normally the lines move fast, but this morning I waited for at least 15 min in the line. I make sure to ask for 2 chick fil a sauces and 2 Polynesian, but this is the second time in a row they've only given me 1 of each. Any idea how disappointing it is to get halfway through your fries/hash browns and run out of Polynesian?! Idk if this is an effort to reduce costs/waste, but i promise if I ask for 2, I will use them. I also didn't get a straw with my drink. It wasn't a problem because I was just going home with my food but if I had to be out and about it would've been inconvenient. Chick Fil A, stop skimping on the sauces when customers ask for more!",
