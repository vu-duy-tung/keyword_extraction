My friend started with 1/2 dozen oysters from the raw bar and followed it up with a fantastic burger (he says the best he has ever had, it has homemade pickles on it!).  We both had a Manhattan that was made perfectly.  The service was friendly and prompt, the music was great and the whole place had a real cool vibe.  Little did we know that our flight would be delayed so we went back and grabbed a local IPA out of the cooler and sat in the back area where they have big overstuffed chairs and couches.  I will never visit the US Airways club again.  This lounge area in the back is my new go to spot on CLT layovers!  Can't wait to get back to CLT to try the hand tossed pizza.  The table next to us ordered one and it looked and smelled delicious!",

I often have salmon at airports and it is over cooked 90% of the time.    The server, Cesar, was friendly, attentive but didn't linger.  I was working on my phone a bit and he'd check in quickly so as not to disturb me.  Last night, I had a server at another restaurant that wanted to tell me his life story while I was trying to focus on my work.

Both were cooked perfectly and the pizza was extra delicious. The best part? Those delicious parm fries.  3) price - would you rather spend $10 dollars and go to BK or come here and spend $10 dollars to get a hand roasted turkey sandwich? or a pizza? or a number of other things? I know what one I will pick.  1897 is a nice place to spend a layover! Don't let the 3.5 star throw you off.",

My only complaint about this place is the lack of flexibility the market offers.  Trying to go \"off menu\" on any level is met with resistance.  For example, I tried to order just a simple side of eggs (they have egg sandwiches, so this should easily be possible) and I was told this isn't possible from the market and I have to go to the restaurant.  Although not a huge deal, it is a bit inconvenient given that it's the same spot.    All in all, though, highly recommended.",

We ordered a round of bloody Mary's that were literally warm on the bottom and chilled at the top. Tasted like sweet clam juice. Terrible!!!  I wasn't completely turned off at this point since some places just don't know how to make a good Bloody Mary. We then ordered the french onion soup because I saw several go by the table and it looked delicious. The soup itself was luke warm with soggy croutons. The cheese on top however looked amazing. After eating the cheese off the top, I was over the soup. They were scooping the warm soup out of a container and then putting cheese on top and in the oven to melt. Flavor not good and barely warm. Next  was our grilled chicken and mushroom sandwich. Thank god we got one to share because we weren't starving. My boyfriend scarfed his half down (which doesn't say much because he'll eat anything) and when I went to take the first bite the smell alone was a no go. The bread was stale and the smell was horrific. I took a half a bite and spit out in my napkin. Our waitress came around and picked up my half of sandwich and fries that I didn't touch, the soup missing the cheese only and two bloody Mary's 3/4 full and never once asked how the meal was. That was the worst $65 I have ever spent in my life. I typically don't write reviews but if I can save someone from eating at this place it's worth it. Wish I would have grabbed a chic filet sandwich instead!",

The hosts were so uninterested we had to get their attention(3 of them). We were seated and not greeted for 15 mins.  No kids menu food and out of chicken tenders.  Restaurant was at 50% capacity  We sat next to kitchen and it was awful to hear the staff talking to one another pretty inappropriately. Talk of \"threesomes\" was pretty prevalent.   I had the truffle chicken sandwich and it was a half breast that was cooked to oblivion.  The pizza was so greasy we used two napkins to sop up grease.   The manager swung by and regretfully I couldn't stay to talk to her because we had to catch our connection. She was very nice, and I wish I had a chance to give her feedback directly.  It's hard to judge a place in the airport based on usual standards but this place can and should do so much better. All people need is a smiling and welcoming face at the host stand to drive more business. You need attentive servers for weary travelers. You need well cooked food as well.  This is coming from someone with 20 years in food service and management.",

Now that we got through all the reasons why you wanted fast food and didn't stop at this gem, let's talk about the food:  Tried the Reese's Country burger. I highly recommend it.

I had a chicken sandwich and my husband had a burger.  Both were really good.  The meats were juicy and the toppings were spot on.  The fries were coated in parmesan and were crispy and hot.

That should not give the waiters (s) the right to gauge other customers and treat us the same.  Not entirely sure if I'll return.",

    "text": "CLT layover junkies, unite! In my unintentional quest to eat at every spot at the Charlotte airport, 1897 Market was next on my hit list.   I asked to be seated at a table, rather than a hightop near the bar since I was in the mood for  a more leisurely meal. The hostess led me around and around to a seating area near the marketplace. This place is big!   To eat, I ordered a pizza and Caesar salad. In True airport dining fashion, the food came out quick! I was actually impressed by the quality of the pizza. It was thin, crispy, and had a nice balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings.   The only turnoff was the very end when it took seemingly forever to pay. My waiter was staring at the TV and it was nearly impossible to catch his gaze. Like I said, I wasn't in a huge rush but it got to the point where I almost went across the restaurant just to get him to grab my check. For that reason, I probably wouldn't recommend sitting down if you don't have a good chunk of time to kill.   Frustrations aside, I took a look at the small market setup on the way out which was a redeeming quality of 1897. They have locally made shirts, popcorns, sweets, and other goodies that are a step above what you'll find at other airport shops.   Chances are I'll be back at CLT very soon and would most likely come back. Next time, I'd probably take up the host's offer to sit closer to the bar for hopefully better service.",

    "text": "1897 Market. (3.5 stars).  Me: Hi, the sign outside says u have a raw bar here? Hostess: No, we don't, the bar does. This is a sit down restaurant. Me: OK, is the bar part of 1897?? Hostess: Yes, but u can't order raw bar items here. Go over there! *Rolling her eyes at me*  So as I was rudely shooed away from the hostess stand, I was tempted NOT to stop at 1897.  However, I'm glad I don't get terribly bothered by rude service because my order was extremely satisfying.  I wish HNL (Honolulu International Airport) could have food half as decent as 1897 Market!!!!  As I sat at the bar, I noticed that the bar has charging stations. Awesome since my phone was in need of a charge.  I was heading to New England & was ready for the last leg of my flight to be done. I was tired & hungry & definitely craving some oysters!!  As I perused the menu I decided on the following:  -Brava Potatoes -East Coast Oysters  Brava Potatoes - $3.99. (3 stars).  I didn't know exactly what to expect as I read the menu description:  \"Crispy bliss potatoes, smoked paprika aioli, & herbs.\"  I love potatoes so I was excited to try this appetizer.  The potatoes were fried perfectly & seasoned with a sprinkle of seasoned salt. Addicting!  The smoked paprika aioli was tasty & packed full of flavor. The aioli was a bit too heavy on the mayo so I scraped most of the sauce off.  The only thing that I was not prepared for was the caramelized onions. Ack. They were mixed in with the aioli which made some potatoes inedible to me because the potatoes were swimming in onions & mayo.  For the price, this is still an appetizer I would order again. I would ask for the sauce on the side with less mayo & no onions!! Nonetheless a very good snack!  East Coast Oysters - $14.99 for 6 oysters. (4 stars).  I feel that these oysters were extremely fresh & plump.  Considering this is an airport restaurant & bar, I was pleased with the quality of these mollusks.  One thing that I wasn't expecting was the sprinkles of fresh cilantro. While I love cilantro, I felt it took away from the raw oyster flavors since cilantro is quite pungent.  After trying one oyster with the cilantro, I took the cilantro off the rest of my oysters so I could enjoy the oyster's natural briny flavor in all its glory.  These oysters come with cocktail sauce & mignonette but I just slurped them up without any sauce.  Definitely worth the price!!  ---  All in all, I'm happy I didn't let the hostess persuade me to leave.  The bartenders were extremely friendly.  I would come back to try 1897's burgers as my neighbor's burger looked juicy & delicious.  Oh how I wish we could get this kind of food choices at HNL!!!  Great place for a meal & drinks while transiting through CLT (Charlotte-Douglas International Airport).",

This place isn't top notch dining and by no means is it the best of airport food, but it's better than most. 1897 Market is huge and there are lots of options like seated dinner, grab and go, and communal tables to pound out some emails while you dine. There's plenty of options to please most adults and kids alike. I had a pizza last time and it was decent. Way better than a Sbarro or something. I requested a place to sit with an outlet to get charged up and it's great to have so many options. I had a couple hours to kill so I leisurely ate my food while getting some work done and charging my phone too.",

You never really have high expectations for it, you're almost always expected to dish out more money than you would like, and for the love of all things holy you're still in an airport. 1897 Market is a restaurant/market? I don't really understand the practicality of the concept other than that during your meal...or before it..or after it..you can walk around their \"marketplace\" which is more like an upscale and overpriced convenience store. But i mean, all the dark wood furnishing! Certainly makes this Snapple tea extra appealing, right?! *heavy sarcasm*. But, hey. They have bar-like areas with LOTS of charging stations, so you can legitimately chill out here for a while for those 4 hour layovers (speaking from a personal experience). My brother and I got their burgers, medium rare. It was...like a 6 out of 10. Above average, not spectacular. I did appreciate that the fries on the side were obviously fresh out the fryer and decently crispy! The bro bro got a bloody mary that was too sweet for my liking but had a decent kick. Wouldn't come here again, but what airport restaurant would i come back to again? really.  The service was good, our waitress was attentive and kind. Also, by the end of the meal I was definitely full, so that's always nice My burger was $13+ and came with a side of (FRESH) french fries, and I think that's pretty fair...right? 3/5.",

Once seated, I was a bit concerned that I did not immediately see a server (I only had 40 min), but one soon emerged to take my order. The staff is quick here, not exactly warm/welcoming, but given the location, speed is preferred to hospitality!  I ordered a fabulous, but over-priced, glass of Malbec and the quinoa salmon salon. Both food and drink came out fast! I was so impressed with my salad! The salmon had a really nice crust and served over a bed of fresh and plentiful greens. I was also quite keen on the salad dressing, which was a walnut vinaigrette.   I will definitely be back here seeing as though it was my second favorite airport meal ever (first place goes to the delicious salad I had at Rick Bayless's place in the Atlanta airport).",

The restaurant lost a star due to the temp of the fries. My wife ordered the blackened, grilled shrimp on sourdough bread slice with pickled onion, Arugula and a basil pesto spread. \"Deeelicious\"! I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, cooked to a perfect juicy medium. However, the fries were not warm. Probably sat on the plate while waiting for the burger to get plated. I wish restaurants would figure out how to fix this. Cold fries happens way too much.  We both had a local craft beer. Excellent and not a bad deal for the 20 oz. pour.   The server caused the restaurant to lose a star because we were not provided enough napkins (one). What was worse, after she said she would be back, we eventually had to get up ourselves to get our own until she finally arrived to our table. I've seen some hit/miss reviews but we experienced a nice time and a great meal.",

The best item on the menu is the Denise's country burger, a mix of sausage and beef in one patty with cheese, bacon and \"BBQ aioli\" (yes, the hipster is strong at 1897).  Ingredients are fresher than expected in an airport restaurant, and the menu is sensibly restrained.  The kitchen seems to focus on doing a few things well, instead of trying to do everything at once, and for the most part they succeed.

Do not get the BBQ shrimp and grits if you are from the south! They are acrid. The tomatoes are so acidic they turn your mouth against the remainder of the dish. Arugula is a garnish...remember that. The shrimp are really good and the grits on their own. The watery gravy they drown the dish in ya not needed or very good in the dish.  I was really hoping to enjoy this meal especially since I travel through the airport often! Oh well, I will not try it again. It is unfortunate there are other things that sound great on the menu. But so did the BBQ shrimp and grits. The hungry traveler!",

The market and the restaurant. The market is open early in the morning as well as the restaurant and the market is a little more laid back and is like a mini Whole Foods. From artisan food like their veggie frittata (yummy) to their organic foods and healthy snacks, they've got everything. They really thought well about the design and layout of the market and the restaurant from the tile design to the It has a nice country chic vibe! Very nice! 1897 is awesome! It has a rustic and classy feel. I love the beautiful decor with a brewery like feel. There is so much detail that went into it from the brick walls to the light fixtures to the wallpape, tiles, and the well-organized intersection of the market, deli and restaurant. Very nice!:) They even have something there for everyone and everything there is very healthy and delicious! So rare to find at airports! They have high quality meats, turmeric shots, and probiotics like Kevita! My kind of store! Their customer service is so good and the people there are so friendly! I have eaten at both the market and the restaurant and I had a good experience at both! Good food, friendly staff, and such a great place to unwind. :)",

I have obviously been spoiled by the great options available in foreign airports like Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt to name just a few. Typically, American airports are crowded by fast food action or really mediocre quality full service establishments.  So today, much to my amazement, I was so pleasantly surprised when I dined at 1897.  The best airport food I have had in a very long time.  The Caesar was crispy, chilled and beautifully seasoned with an anchovy based dressing. The croutons were crunchy and crisp.  The chicken wings were uniquely prepared. They had been sauced, I surmise, prior to being cooked. Just sublime. They had a crispness to the bone and I really like that.  I have dinged them for sub-par service.  I could see that the wings sat at the kitchen counter for a while before the server picked them up. The young lady was friendly and charming but you gotta be on top of picking up the orders.  So, a pleasant experience overall.",

I asked politely to be moved and one of the staff cleaned off a dirty table and sat me down nearby on a bench seat. Where I sat for 15 minutes while others were brought in, sat down and immediately attended by a server. After the last time a server came to a nearby table and walked right by me and left, I bailed on this place asap. This is a freaking airport! You don't make people wait 15 minutes to order! This is a very unprofessional establishment for an airport and unfortunately is destined to fail. Do not support them unless they dramatically clean up their act. Beware.",

Getting increasingly frustrated, I stumbled into 1897 Market and was amazed by its size and great energy.  I was immediately seated and my waitress had my iced tea in under 5 min.  There is also grab and go seating for when it is crowded.  It is like a fully stocked c-store with a restaurant!  My mood suddenly started to lighten up!  I tried to be semi healthy and went with the carved turkey cobb.   This was an amazing salad!!!  It was loaded with some of the best turkey I can remember.  The sharp blue cheese, crispy bacon, egg and yummy croutons all mixed into a wonderful combination that was anything but an ordinary salad.  It was a big salad, but the tiny portion of iceberg lettuce reassured me that this was a healthy choice. The large menu contains sandwiches, salads, BBQ, mac and cheese along with some pretty good looking pizzas.    My server was really good!  She kept refills coming on iced tea and had a huge smile.  The whole experience was great from start to finish - I highly recommend 1897 Market!  This is my new go to spot when travelling to Charlotte Airport.",

Like most restaurant dining experiences in the airport, they won't care in the slightest that I'm writing this review, but I encourage you to vote with your feet and your wallet.  1897 Market's food is one of the highlights, in fact, as airport dining goes, they're probably in the top tier, at least for CLT (this ain't no ATL!).  The menu has a selection of pizzas and sandwiches, which come with some solid parmesan fries.  I particularly enjoyed their Truffle Chicken sandwich, which is both healthier and tasty.  Be aware, you can't pop in and out, but if you have a decent amount of connect time (40 minutes to board), then you can probably eat here.  That said, the food is good for an airport, and it's priced accordingly.  If you were to buy a chicken sandwich outside of here, you wouldn't be paying the $3-5 mark up.  So if you're money conscious, this isn't your place.  My experience with service here has also been mixed.  While I've had waitresses who are totally on point, I've also left irritated after 10 minutes of being seated, without getting so much as a greeting (and watching 5 other tables get seated, greeted, and their orders taken).  Service is the big component here, as the food isn't good enough to justify the price on its own.    Protip, if they ask you if you're ok with a high top, confirm with them whether it's communal and near their purchase in go area.  They are particularly terrible at figuring out how to service this area, and how to find a customer.",

The grilled chicken was cooked perfectly, bread was fresh, but the best part was the aoli sauce on the sandwich. It was so flavorful with truffles and delicious. I splurged for the fries, which were yummy, crispy, and well seasons worth parmesan.  They have a few TVs, so it's a great place to stop and catch a game if you have a long layover!",

    "text": "I had some time to kill at the Charlotte airport before a flight at 11 a couple weeks ago, so I looked around at basically all the restaurants in the airport before deciding to get a to-go order of the grit bake off their breakfast menu (to eat on the plane after boarding), as it looked the most interesting and the most filling. I'm really glad I got here before 10 (when breakfast ends), because their lunch menu absolutely looks just as overpriced as you would expect from an airport restaurant, but $11 for a good brunch dish is pretty much exactly in line with what I'd expect to pay at a nice brunch restaurant locally. They were completely willing to let me order only a to-go item, and even let me sit at the bar and not order anything for about 10 minutes while it was being prepared. And their bartender was so friendly, I even tipped her a little even though literally all she did was run my card and then hand me a bag (and I suppose let me use a space at her bar, but there was plenty of space, being 9 AM on a weekday.) And I ordered the eggs done over-medium (probably the hardest egg request), and got them back totally perfectly over-medium, just like I asked (yay!)  Food-wise, if it had been land-side, I'd give it a solid 4 stars. It was tasty and filling, and everything was clearly pretty fresh, but what I really wanted to try because it was so unique was the \"bacon and tomato jam\", and I couldn't really taste it over everything else. But it was still a pretty solid brunch offering, and given that I was at an *airport*, where the average restaurant is both overpriced and terrible most places, I was particularly impressed by that. And keep in mind - I ordered it at 9:30, walked around with it for a couple hours, and then ate it on a plane in the air a couple hours later, so it probably would've been even tastier if I'd eaten right when it came out. It was still pretty good when I had it, too, though, even at mostly room temperature by that point.",

The food is very good, the beverage (alcohol) choices are great but very pricey if comparing different locations at the airport. It also has a lounge area in the back of the market. If offers a few couches and even more single chairs to just sit back and chill! Very home feeling, which is an awesome thing to have at the airport! Check it out, you won't be sorry! I'll definitely be back!",

I enjoy the pancakes and bacon. It's real bacon.   I'd probably give this restaurant a rating of 3 or 4 stars if it weren't for the consistently horrible service!! I've given this restaurant numerous chances to get it right, but they continuously fail.  Inattentive servers may or may not get around to you in a timely manner. They may get your food out to you while it's still warm. And, if your lucky, you'll get the check taken care of before you have to race to your gate to make your flight. But, I have yet to visit this restaurant and not have to get a manager involved just to get my check or my food. Not that THAT helps. The managers I've experienced have been just as lackadaisical about the service as the servers.   I've given up on this restaurant. Good luck making your flight of you eat there.",

Who clearly hated her job and tried to walk as slow as possible to appear to be \"working\"- My table smelled like a dirty rag, so we moved.  We had a lovely waitress who brought us a drink. The drink had what looked like a huge booger in it. Yes, a booger. A huge one. In my drink.  Food was tasty, we had a pesto pasta and a chicken sandwich. The meal was way too overpriced, even for airport food. The one drink, pasta and sandwich was $60 with tax and tip. Yikes.   I strongly recommend the Farms Bar b q place just outside this 1897 location. Much less money, pride in the product and great tasting as well.",

    "text": "GOODNESS ME, WHAT A JOY. Today at the Charlotte Airport, me and some pals walked by a restaurant that caught our eye. In bold lettering it was marked \"1897,\" precisely 100 years prior to our birth. Walking past 5 wooden fans mounted on the wall, we found our seats and they felt like home. As Melissa greeted us, we were handed menus with a rustic, elegant feel and we were so excited to explore its contents. After perusing for a few moments, details such as \"succulent beef,\" \"sizzling tang,\" and \"rocky wheat\" really got our tongue bumps a-goin'.  Quite to our surprise, Melissa appeared at our table once more, only to offer me the greatest enhancing dining option: A  F R I E D  E G G.  But don't be fooled, this is not a breakfast establishment. This dippy masterpiece was to be placed atop said \"succulent beef,\" completed with lettuce, white cheddar, onion, and mushroom trappings nestled between the tradition German pretzel... in the form of a bun! I can't emphasize this enough: yummy meal. With each bite I lost a tooth - I guess they couldn't handle the flavor. Chomp chomp chomp, done. I honestly can say, i blacked out during part of my eating process, so I was unsure how the others enjoyed their meals. I inquired about their experiences, and they hooped and hooped about it. This is when Melissa reappeared, and commandeered our devoured food platters. If you ever find yourself wondering through the Queen City airport in search of  something edible, let Melissa hook you up at 1897. Obviously the food is amazing, but the atmosphere complete with salt and pepper shakers so large you could fit your fist inside added a floofy sparkle to my ear-to-ear grin. Remember those fans? They didn't turn, but I sure wish we could have turned around for just one more nibble.",

We sampled some local beers on tap and enjoyed a fresh made wood fired pizza on the leg out. On the way back we stopped again and shared a burger and Parmesan fries. All food was tasty and fresh. Open kitchen means no surprises. The place appeared brand new and was sparkling clean.  It is \"Market Style\" with a Raw Bar station a Pizza Station and a Grill and Salads station.

The waiter was very prompt and suggested the \"country burger\" when I asked him what he liked.  The burger came very promptly and was truly one of the best burgers I've had in my life. Very juicy, and I had to eat the last few bites with a knife and a fork but that's not a complaint - it's a compliment because of how juicy it was. I also like to complement the waitstaff.

The first bite was mind-blowing. It'd order another one now as I sit here if I had the room in my stomach. Add the flavor of the meat to the pimento and bacon and you have a legit delicious burger. Decent beer selection and well and centrally located in the hub of the airport. I'll be back!",

Huge TV's, a large spacious layout with a modern and trendy presentation and the ability to watch the chefs prepare the food all really made me excited about eating here   The menu is large with burgers and a few other staples to offer. The service was really great too. My waiter was eager to please, enthusiastic, and checked in on me often. This was especially appreciated since it was really busy.   I went with the mushroom and spinach pizza which was decent but not great. Guess overall o couldn't complain too much as it was pretty good given the bar for airplane foods. Just dont go in expediting to have your socks blown off. the drinks, however, are where I take issue. Because none of the cocktails handpicked I asked my waiter how much they were, generally. He told me \"$13-$15 range,\" which I was cool with because it seemed reasonable. So I ordered the Pisco Sour, a whiskey sour knock off. The shit was $17. It was a fine drink but I've NEVER heard of a damn two bit whiskey sour impression costing SEVENTEEN AMERICAN DOLLARS. If you're going to feature a cocktail costing that much at least have the courtesy to list the price or warn your customers PROPERLY before letting them order one.   Over all, this spot was just decent. Go here if stuck in the airport for awhile.",

Atmosphere - I walked up to the hostess station.  She took me to my table, it looked like a tiny place from the front but she kept winding me through more and more tables.  The only problem is that they give you these metal chairs after sitting on airplane seats.  Please give me more comfortable chair.  Food   Drinks - I had two different local IPA beers, first was a can of Over the Edge and later a 14 ounce draft of Hop Drop 'N Roll.  Excellent choices.    My Main Course - I went with a Charlotte Burger.  I guess I was too hungry, I ate half of it before I knew it.  It was a solid burger but nothing that special.  Service - Speed was a thing here, but I had a two and half layover.  But the beers still seemed to take a long time to come to me.  Future - Sure.",

This place is big and attractive. There are some grab-and-go items, but I decided to get table service. I chose the \"creamy\" pasta with chicken and tomatoes for $18.  It was TERRIBLE. Like, comically terrible. There was nothing creamy about it--just oily. No creamy sauce. The chicken tasted....dusty? Like dry and....dusty. I can't think of another way to say it. There were a couple sad pieces of spinach and also sundried tomatoes (I thought the menu said roasted tomatoes, I can't prove it for sure, but sundried tomatoes are not the same).   There were TWO DIFFERENT types of pasta noodles. Like they had clearly just thrown in some leftover pasta from another dish (I figured it out--they were mac n cheese noodles). One of the types of pasta noodles were way overcooked. The entire thing seemed re-heated.  It tasted like something I'd make at home, then think, \"Eh, I guess it's edible.\"  It is criminal to charge $18 for this. If I hadn't used a voucher, I would have sent it back. Heck, I should have sent it back anyway. I was just so hungry.   After eating there, every single place I walked by, I thought, \"I could have used my voucher there. or there. or there. or there....\" anything would have been better than that terrible, overpriced pasta.",

During my wait for my 2nd beer, the lady at the table next to me had to leave because in a span of roughly 30 minutes, all she had gotten was a frickin bottle of water, which probably cost about $8.00...all she ordered to eat was a salad and they couldn't get that to her in 30 minutes?

Must be nice to be on the clock and not have to do your job.  I just might apply!!  My latest visit started with me standing at the host stand and watching the girl click away on her phone.  After about 30 seconds I said, \"Good morning.\"  She looked up and said, \"If you want a seat, she [pointing to another girl sitting down, clicking away on her phone] will help you...\" then went back to her phone.  In disgust, the other girl got out of her seat with a loud sigh and said, \"This way...\" without asking how many in my party, greeting me, or anything.  She sauntered to the back of the restaurant, put the menu on a table and walked off without another word.  Great job so far!  Two for two.    As for the server, I have no review.  Waiting 10 minutes for someone to show up is way too long.  No water.  No \"someone will be right with you.\"  No \"your server is having connectivity with her phone and can't update her status.\"  No \"the kitchen is on fire so there will be a wait because your server is also on the Fire Safety Squad.\"  Nothing.    Strike three!    It is a shame because I have been here many times before and enjoyed each meal.    I will not be coming back.  Screw that noise!",

The Parmesan fries were also very good but not as hot or crisp as \"perfect\" would be. The steak was a medium grade with a tardy peppercorn sauce on the side and no fat.

A few mins later placed order for turkey Cobb salad.  a gentlemen then sat down next to me and proceeded to order same item.   10 minutes pass and the waitress brings out the salad and says to me \"yours is coming right up\".   After 20 more mins and 2 inquiries my salad arrives.  Guy next to me finishes his salad and says \"you must have pissed someone off\".  The salad is pretty good and huge.  Service is pretty mediocre and the attitude of the blonde behind the bar needs a serious adjustment.  Some people should not be customer facing and she is certainly one of them.",

The hostess was not friendly by any means, not even a courtesy smile. When she asked if I wanted a high top or a low top she didn't even talk to me she asked in my general direction and I did not hear what she said.  I hate sitting in the middle of a dinning area and asked to sit somewhere not in the middle to which she showed me to another section where the table was in a similar spot.  I finally looked up and asked for a 2 top off to the side.  I get section seating but there is also customer preference.  It took about 10 min for my server to come to the table. He never introduced himself.  I ordered water with lime which took another ten minutes to get, no lime.  I ordered a house salad and the pesto chicken pasta which both came at the same time and I am pretty sure my pasta sat under the heating lamp for a while before it was served. The food was delicious but lukewarm. My server failed to fill my water or ask me if I wanted a refill on the first go round and I had to practically grab him to get my water to which he took my glass leaving me with nothing.  He referred to me as \" sweety\" and I could probably be his mother.  New water glass arrived and I did not see him for at least 20 min., luckily I have a long lay over... when I did see him. I was standing up on the other side of the table clearly ready to leave.  He was clearing the table behind me and I literally had to say \"excuse me, may I have my bill\". He did not have this prepared and had to walk away again.  Again food was great service sucked.  I won't recommend this on that account unless this changes.",

But I ordered a Cobb salad with balsamic dressing and it was really bad.   I don't normally give low rated reviews just for the heck of it but this place seems like it should be avoided. The Cobb was barely edible. There were no many plasticy or chemical flavors within it I could barely eat it. I mean maybe it was just a stroke of bad luck and if someone wanted to argue with me, I'd no ok with being wrong.

My water came out first, followed shortly by my wine order (6 or 9 oz pours available), and then my sandwich.  I ordered the Carved Turkey Sandwich on pumpernickel.  It was served with parmesan fries.  The sandwich was flavorful and served its nutritional purpose.    The restaurant is also a market. You can pick up snacks, juices, cookies, nuts, something for your upcoming flight.  There was also live music (Thursday evening) rendered by a saxophone player with recorded background music.  He was pretty good (played Alicia Keys and Neyo).  This is a pretty cool place.  I am giving them 4 stars because their prices are definitely airport worthy.",

My favorite item is the Spring Salad, which comes with mixed greens, poached shrimp, strawberries, bacon, candied walnuts and a dash of granola. I prefer it with the balsamic vinaigrette. Yes, the price point is high (~$12) but it is not out of the ordinary for an airport. I love that my husband and I can get a low-guilt meal before we head out on whatever adventure we're headed to (which usually involves significant eating).   If you're not into salads, 1987 Market also has freshly made flat breads and sandwiches and a fairly substantial \"grab and go\" section with combos like fruit and cheese plates as well as standards like yogurts, hummus cups, and string cheeses.  The restaurant has both an eat in and a take out area. I have never dined at the bar, but it looks nice, and if the staff is as friendly on the bar side as they are on the to go side, I'm sure it would be a pleasant experience.",

Being a restaurant in a hustlin bustlin airport, those two are definitely the key factors to having a successful restaurant, and keeping customers coming back!  My coworker and I came here at about 3pm, starving cause we haven't had lunch yet. Our laptop was also in need of some juice so we were hoping to get seated near a wall outlet. Knowing it was a reach, we were very pleasantly surprised when the hostess knew exactly where to take us, and found us a table with wall plugs despite the restaurant being almost at full capacity!  We quickly ordered a dirty mac and cheese and some garlic fries. Both items were brought out within 5-10 minutes of us ordering it. Gotta love the quick service here! Although the dirty mac and cheese dish looked decently small, it was very filling and I was barely able to finish! The garlic fries, in my opinion, wasn't as great as how I had imagined it to be based on other Yelp reviews.   My coworker and I are already talking about coming back here next time we leave Charlotte airport. Needless to say we had a good experience!",

The other sides have well appointed bar tables with outlets aplenty. There are ample choices when it comes to seating.  The food selection looks fresh and good. They have some refrigerated sections and some tables with fun merchandise, even highlighting local Charlotte businesses.   The music is a tad on the loud side, depending on what is playing, but I get the need to drown out the airport noise. Bring your earbuds if you have sensitive ears.   If you get to the airport early or have a layover, this is the place to wait.",

I really wanted to like it based on its cute appearance (restaurant/market) but overall was not that impressed.   Granted I was visiting during the Thanksgiving holiday week so the dining area was quite busy, and I was in no hurry at all, but the service was really, really slow. Also, I ordered the Turkey Cobb salad and it was not good (great presentation, though). There was just no a lot of flavor to the dish, and not all that fresh either. Quite disappointing particularly given the price of the dish (around $14).  I will say I had two Bloody Mary's - pretty spicy - and they were very tasty. That's a positive!  All-in-all, I think if I ever pass through the Charlotte airport again I'll look for another place to grab some nosh.",

The breakfast menu looked good enough, but I wanted an omelet anyway.  I debated between the veggie and Turkey (it is nice to have more than one option that isn't pork).  I ordered the turkey and it came out in a timely fashion.  Since it was early I didn't check out their beer selection, but it sounds like I will have good options when I am back for dinner sometime.  Their prices are on par with airport prices but it seems like better food than Chili's Too had.  Bad Daddy's in C is a good spot for breakfast too, but I like to have more options near A since that is where I usually fly out of.",

I have seen this location many times but didn't have time to try it.  Today the flight from Chicago was in 40 minutes early and beat the lunch crowd so I stopped.  And I am glad I did for the food.  But unfortunately the service was poor.  When I arrived they were not crowded but it took a while to get a menu from the waiter, Richard, and then another wait to place my order.   The meal came quickly, delivered by someone else.  And then I didn't see Richard again until 10 minutes after I finished.  Then I had to stare him down to get the bill so I could pay and leave to catch my next flight.  This poor level. of course lowered the overall score.  One thing I don't understand is why the trend started to pile all the ingredients separately around the the salad instead of distributing or mixing them over the entire salad so that you can get a combination of the flavors.  This trend bothers as much as the practice of piling the meat or fish on top of potatoes or something else.  I don't understand why they do it.",

Overall I would highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Gah! What happened you guys?? You made me have to write my first 1 star!  I came here on Thursday 8/13 for a flight to Boston, and I wanted to take the Lady and have her experience what I experienced when I first came here (it was great, I was SO excited to come back and update to 5 star). We sat at the bar this time, and after sitting down, it took a couple of minutes for anybody to recognize that we were there. The waiter got us two waters, and the food menu.  We had been chatting with a couple next to us who had two sandwiches that looked tasty (one was a turkey sandwich, one a chicken with beets?) and they had highly recommended them. Well, after about 8 minutes of our waiter not giving anybody much attention, our order was finally taken.   Our waters were almost empty, but no water refills for us.   While that was happening, a man came up next to us and ordered a plate of little neck clams, as well as a chicken sandwich. He got his clams, which was a giant bowl of ice, and then four of the tiniest clams I've ever seen (both he and I agreed that we didn't know they could exist that small). He miraculously found the manager, told him about it (the manager was pretty speechless, but didn't really apologize), and got comp'd another plate of clams to make up for the first. These ones were just as small, but at least it was the amount of food he bargained for.  Still no food for us, no water refills for us.  A couple of minutes later, he received his chicken sandwich, which he took one bite of, and then tapped the top bun on the counter... *DINK DINK DINK* it was rock solid. He also said his fries were ice cold.   Still no food, no water refills.  We asked our original waiter if he could see where in the heck our sandwiches were. He went to the back. Didn't see him again.  After about 5 or so minutes of waiting, we got fed up, told the manager everything we'd been through, STILL no water or food, and we left. Miffed that we wasted that much time before our flight on nothingness.  We're lucky that we didn't pay anything; they will not be receiving our service again.",

I got shrimp on toast with brava potatoes. While there were only three shrimp, it was off the appetizer menu, so that's okay. The salad on the shrimp toast was quite fresh and yummy. The potatoes were slightly sauced with something but good as well. I got quick and efficient service. I'll eat here again when time is appropriate.",

Great food, a bit on the pricey end but what isn't in the airport.  Very few places show up with raw oysters too, which this place had if that was your poison while you waited for your flight.  They had three TVs up, but it was more like 2 since one was situated behind a support beam which was unfortunate.   This setup could be a bit better for Sunday football season.   Just saying.  They had great beers on tap, and i ordered myself a Shocktop draft.   I also got a roast beef sandwich called the \"Southern Wreck\" which was to die for.  Amazing.  It was like a French dip, but I believe it had way better cheese melted, and some other goodies in it.  Let me put it this way... I didn't want to put it down, and when it was gone, I was wondering if I should order another one just for the hell of it.  Great place and it wraps around the gift shop area.  I'd be curious if they take in enough money to keep the place packed, but it seemed like it was pretty full the entire afternoon I was there while waiting for my my flight back home.   I have to say that if you have some time to kill at Charlotte International?   See if you're able to stop by the 1897.",

    "text": "As I was being led back to my table, I marvelled at how much it seemed to remove you from the feeling of being at an airport (if you overlook the luggage next to every person). Just 3 steps past the hostess booth, you are immersed in noise from conversations, HVAC, radio music and the grill stations. The [Knob Creek] Old Fashioned that I sipped while I waited for my order was smooth but lacked an actual cherry (which I was hoping for based on the description - unless the pulp at the bottom was it?!). Word of warning, it also cost more than my meal!! She did not ask if I wanted water and it was not provided by default. Despite (or because of) the menu warnings about undercooked meat, I wasn't asked my opinion about how I wanted my 'Neese Country Burger cooked, although I wonder if it would have made a difference. The patty seemed fried rather than grilled, although the overall burger wasn't dry. The cheese was a nice flavor, and I may not have been as happy with the burger if I had opted out. The fries were crispy [to a fault some might say, but better that than soggy!], but otherwise unremarkable. For a busy restaurant, the waitress often asked how I was doing as she passed. Nearby, a manager appeared to be attending a customer complaint, with follow up by the waitress. At the end of the meal, I am torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars, due to price, location, quality and service. I'm going to settle on 4 stars because I was not inconvenienced by any delays and also with the hope that they will always strive to improve.",

Nothing unusual or innovative, but the food tastes good. I had the open faced sandwich. - Quick, moderately priced meal: From order to delivery of food took just 10 minutes. Granted, this was breakfast and not peak time. Prices are acceptable.  - Relaxing atmosphere: If you have a long stopover, this is a wonderful place to sit and enjoy and meal or beverage. Happy, country chic vibe. Forget you are in the airport.  - Accommodating service: Servers and hostess are friendly and did not rush me. Have to ask for things (e.g., water, knife, etc.) and maybe more than once before it is delivered, which may be frustrating for some.",

This place appears to be beautiful and professional from the exterior but they do say \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Unless you've got four hours until you board your flight, you're better off eating questionable sushi in the NC airport. It took an hour for my husband and I to get a salad and a chicken sandwich... during this hour, four separate tables walked away without either being asked to order or receiving their food. When it arrives, it's alright, nothing to be excited about, and definitely NOT worth the hour wait. When I asked for ketchup, fifteen minutes went by, and I got up and asked someone for it and found five employees standing around in the wait station chatting while customers walked away from their tables. Again, what a joke.",

    "text": "I appreciated 1897 Market because, when you're stuck eating at an airport, food options tend to be limited, and are normally insanely repetitive and uncreative in nearly every airport one travels through (think Sbarro pizza, McDonalds, Cinnabon, etc.).  Here at Charlotte airport they do have a handful of more unique and creative food and drink options vs. many other airports, and on my most recent layover here I was happy to find this place, the 1897 Market.  This venue offers several options, everything from a full \"be seated by a hostess and be served\" restaurant experience, to a made to order pizza bar, to another area where they have a display cooler for those who just want to grab a sandwich, salad or other cold foods and drinks to go, or to quickly enjoy here.  They have an interesting seating area for the people who get the \"to go\" items, which is laid out more like a cozy and rustic living room with couches, comfy seating and a large flat screen TV on the wall.  Otherwise, to go customers are banished to a set of high tables with stools (and power connections for laptops, phones and other devices), but \"to go\" customers are reminded that they are not to sit at any of the low tables with chairs, as those are only for customers who are here for full restaurant service.  Prices aren't horrible, I had a rather large and filling cobb salad for $9 and a bottle of Vitamin Water for $4.",

There is a bar out front, plenty of tables inside, a number of booths, many high-chair counters with charging stations and even a lounge with plush seating.  The food clearly is an attraction with a raw bar, handmade pizzas and lots of southern favorites, but what prompted this review was their impressive lineup of spirits and craft beer. Local favorites NoDa and Birdsong are available both on tap and in a cooler to-go, plus you can get options from around NC like Duck Rabbit, Foothills, Catawba and Lonerider. Carolina Ale House over at the end of Concourse C may have Carolina Blonde on tap, but this place has a better variety and much more appealing atmosphere.  This place would get plenty of business even if it were not in an airport, so next time you have 30 minutes or more with a layover, make your way to 1897 Market for something delicious.",

Stated that waitress should have informed me that drinks are \"doubles\".   (She didn't).   In any event this is what makes good companies great.   Awesome management.   They refunded the charge and have proven that some companies actually care. Very Impressive.    I'll be back.   We\"re still trying to shake off the violative feeling we experienced after a lay-over at Charlotte International Airport and are not recommending anyone visit the 1897 Market.    Wife and I were looking for a salad and a quick drink.  We chose the mixed greens salad with Walnut vinegarette dressing and the side of breast of chicken $15.98 per salad....a bit pricey, but the salad was fresh and we wanted healthy.  Wife and I decided on a Bloody Mary- spicy.   Well we had no idea the real spice would be served with our bill!  Our very friendly and capable waiteress Brittney delivered unto us a whopping bill for $64.89 for 2 salads, and 2 bloody Mary's.  Suffice to say we were completely sticker shocked!  Not something we're often accused of being--as we gladly pay for either quality, service or hopefully -- both, and tip handsomely when we encounter such.  When questioned our friendly waitress was left to explain the exorbinate rate for two very nominal drinks as \" the airport sets what we can charge\".  Huh?   Perhaps next time she takes an order for one shot of vodka and some tomatoe juice she should--in the best interest of the consumer, disclose their price of $13.99 !!     This restaurant was nominal at best, and I saw two tables leave in my short time there due to an inattentive wait staff,  Nevertheless, despite my belief that the \"airport\" should cover her tip -- I still tipped her 16% as I'm not content penalizing a young lady for her employer's greed.  I would urge ALL TRAVELERS to avoid the 1897 Market at ALL COSTS.  Save your money this place is a rip off factory.  Understanding prices will be higher in airports is part of the game---gratuitously profiteering is just plain and simple greed and trickery.

I had a salmon salad and everything included was delicious and in the right amount. What was included with my meal, i could have done without. The hostesses were rude, disrespectful, cursed under their breath, at one point i heard a hostess say \"omg if they don't hurry the hell up\" as she was escorting 4 elderly patrons to their table. The saving grace of their staff was my server, Trent. He was polite, gracious, and appeared to enjoy his job. I'd suggest ordering food to go here, and enjoying it in an atmosphere that is much more about hospitality. And yes, even in an airport you can have hospitality",

Everything from that point with her was delayed, entered incorrectly, or she just forgot what I asked for (like my drink and then a refill).   Food was meh. I ordered a burger with bacon, which came out severely over cooked and barely warm to the touch, a side salad and a side of fries. All the plates came out with grease smeared on the plates from dirty gloves and even my drink had, what I hope was, iced tea grounds.   There are a lot of other options at this airport. I'll likely shop here at the market, but I won't be sitting for a full serve meal in the future.",

Immediately greeted and seated with a smile. Our server Ryan was fantastic! She was friendly, she was efficient, the orders were accurate, and she was available but not hovering too much.  The food was good. The burger was tasty and well prepared and the pretzel bun it was on was fantastic. I had a side salad instead of fries and it too was good and actually a nice size. The wine is a bit pricey but otherwise no complaints! Ryan made the experience awesome!",

They do a respectable Reuben w/ russian dressing or the chunky chicken salad if you want to eat less poorly. Chicken pesto pizza is quite good (the price simulates a delivery charge to the airport.) Crust is light and flaky around the edge and cooked through in the middle despite the abundance of veggies on top. Light and flavory but a dash of hot sauce helps it breathe and grated parmesan would be a nice touch. Regardless, it pairs well with Capt Jack ;-)",

I had their cobb salad which was fresh, and delicious.  The ingredients were of high caliber and not cheaper deli meats you sometimes find.  The service is awesome.  They're extremely quick and efficient, and the staff are very friendly and polite.  The restaurant itself is centrally located in CLT with easy access from all terminals.  It has a clean, open and airy feel to it but does tend to get busy during peak times, though there is plenty of table, hightop and bar style seating available.  It always feels a bit pricey, but which airport store/deli/restaurant doesn't?  Regardless, this wasn't my first visit and won't be my last.  The food is great, awesome service, and very convenient.",

I do not fly often, but on my most recent trip, I discovered this upscale restaurant and one in Philadelphia.  In this review you will find my comments on the food I ate, the menu offerings and the unique overall concept.  Steak Frites was my choice and i was pleased with the strip steak and fries. The onion sauce with the steak was very nice and complimented the meat perfectly. When the server asked how I liked it, I said, \"as rare as you can legally cook it.\" That is exactly what I got. Aged beef it was not, but it was much better than the lower end steak restaurants offer. I liked it. It was a tad tough, but very flavorful.   French fries were very good, but the batch I got was inconsistent. One fry would be perfect. The next one was crunchy as a shoe string potato, while a third may be soggy.  Menu offerings were varied. You could get steak house type meals, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, oysters, salads, etc. Odd thing, though - There were only four varieties of each.  The place was a combination of upscale restaurant, sports bar, pizzeria, oyster bar, grab and go deli, and a shop with different food items.   A fun place. Check it out.",

All of the pictures show a thinner cut fry but these were steak frys. (Straight opinion on that). The pizza was below average. I got the pizza because there were alot of positive reviews but it was far from that. \"Tasteless\" is really the right word for it. They need a better cheese or something to really give it flavor. Oh, and you better like mushrooms because it's LOADED with them.  Service started off good but ended bad. We were the farthest table from the front and honestly just thought forgotten about. I had to go ask for a spoon. My wife had to walk to someone to ask to check us out so we could leave. No pickles with the burger even after I ordered extra pickles.

Since I had so much time, I opted to sit down and enjoy my food. I ordered the carved turkey breast sandwich on a pretzel roll since they ran out of sourdough bread (what the sandwich is normally on). The turkey breast wasn't your typical deli-sliced turkey. The turkey was a thick piece of meat that was slightly dry but otherwise well-seasoned and accompanied by havarti cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The sandwich was incredibly filling and was served with standard fries. Overall, it was a good meal. Though a tad bit pricey, I would be back for some nice fresher food at the airport.",

I'm not a huge trout fan but I absolutely loved the trout and the sauce, as well as the Brussels sprouts underneath. Huge portion as well, had enough for my lunch the next day. A little pricey, but great quality and if I ever stop in Charlotte again I'd for sure come here.",

It had a nice char on the beef patty and crispy bacon with lots of yummy pimento cheese.   I wish I would have went with the salad, like the one I saw sitting at my neighbors plate. Instead I tried the French fries that were fine but kinda soggy.   Glad to have found this place in the airport, that makes you feel like you're not in an airport.",

I really wanted to like this restaurant but sadly it just did not live up to expectations.   First waitstaff was great, very friendly and warm. They gave a True representation of southern hospitality and service.   However once the food came out I was greatly disappointed. I came in for breakfast and ordered the Carolina scrambler. It promised, cheese grits, bacon, biscuit and eggs and an arugula salad tossed in a Tabasco vinaigrette. Bacon came out soggy and soft and the vinaigrette was missing. Staff was accommodating and brought the vinaigrette on the side but by the time I got it my eggs and grits were cold.   I believe this place could be better if the cook staff paid better attention to their plates and ensured each plate came out to southern standards.",

Even chatted with a few follow travelers. Now back to this heaven in a glass drink I had.  This was the best mai tai I ever had.  I did give me a light buzz so it was not missing the alcohol but so good you really didn't taste the alcohol. Hats off to the bartender. Think my husband was trying to get me drunk as he wanted to order me another.  Had to say no because if I did he would have been carrying me and my carry to our flight gate.  They are not scared with the prices but what decent airport restaurant isn't. Hope for another layover in Charlotte thanks  1897 market",

I've been in airports and had little time to grab a plastic boxed sandwich between flights and I've been in airports for hours and hours - enough time to drink way too many beers.   It's an A-I-R-P-O-R-T!  Hint, hint...  1897 Market?  Pretty good - better than average in my not-so-humble opinion.  Lots of food selections, drinks galore...all delivered with quick and (somewhat attentive) service.  I made it through security :30 minutes ahead of my traveling companion and was able to sit, order and drain a beer before he arrived.  The waiter made sure I had what I needed quickly and with a smile.  When my associate arrived, menus and brews showed up quickly.    The food was quite decent.  No, it wasn't \"other-worldly,\" but it was good.    Bottom line: 1897 Market is a great AIRPORT spot.  4 stars...I will return next time I'm passing through CLT!",

There is really a spacious dining area in the back, but you can't see it from the area near the host stand. There's a variety of seating from high tops to bar seats and tables.   I had the Truffle Chicken Sandwich with salt and pepper fries. I am not sure that I have ever had the truffle flavor on chicken, but it worked really nicely. The vegetables were crisp and fresh (especially the lettuce) and the fries have a nice flavor to them. They also have a decent selection of wines, beers, and cocktails (but FYI, the cocktails are ~$17 but have no prices on the menu). I enjoyed the South African Chenin Blanc and was pleased to see that they offered both 6 oz. and 9 oz. pours, which is something your typically only see at a proper wine bar.   You know what--five stars. I don't know if I've ever given a five to an airport restaurant before, but 1897 Market did it right.",

    "text": "This restaurant is much larger than it appears from the entry - don't be deterred by the inevitable line at the host. They seem to have an issue with seating people promptly, but the service is quick after that.   They try hard to have a good ambiance in an airport, with moderate success. The restaurant is still very noisy and cramped. There is not much room for luggage around the tightly packed tables. There was also a saxophonist playing, which made it even more chaotic feeling.   They have a good draft list with some local NC options. The menu is heavy on burgers and sandwiches. I was disappointed to find that the only vegetarian options were flatbread pizzas. How hard could try be to offer a veggie burger substitute?   The mushroom and spinach pizza I ended up with was quite tasty. The crust was impressive - super thin and chewy. Unfortunately in the middle, there seemed to be a hole, or maybe the water from the veggie toppings just made the dough soggy.",

To be fair it's a market place. I disagree with other reviews; the service mine was excellent. My waitress took my beer order promptly after she helped me select a local beer. I played it safe and ordered the mushroom pizza. The crust is soggy in the center so there's obviously no pizza oven. The pizza sauce lacks real flavor, but in all the pizza is tasty and satisfying. I had 2 hours to kill so I did take my time but my food came out within 5-10 minutes. I don't think the meal took 40 minutes, but I wouldn't come here in a rush. That being said do people come to airport dine-in restaurants when they're in a rush?",

We wanted breakfast but they had stopped serving it so we went with their lunch options. The service was quick and our food came out pretty fast. I ordered the dirty mac and cheese which was a pile of scrumptious pulled pork on a bowl of creamy pasta. The pasta was much larger pieces than your typical mac and cheese noddles but nonetheless was tasty. It was a decadent dish that I really enjoyed and my husband enjoyed his sandwich.

Service friendly for early AM. No $15 Bloody Mary since it was Sunday before noon.  Menu does state this dish has runny eggs and you can ask for them to cook them more if desired.   Will visit again if in the airport. Lots of to go items to choose from as well.",

    "text": "My most recent layover was in Charlotte where I had a hungry stomach and 3 hours to kill.  So, I was looking for a spot I could grab a bite and write some Yelp reviews like a good Yelp nerd would.  1897 Market was my spot.  There were a lot of spots on the wall with outlets for charging and electronics using, but have your back to everyone else and I'm not cool with that at the airport: too many weirdoes walking around snooping and doing other weird things.  I asked to sit at a table on the wall and got a good spot.  The food wasn't too bad.  I went with my server's (Zach) advice and order the shrimp and grits.  It went against my better judgment of what I know about food cost to quantity/quality ratio, but I took his advice and it worked out well.  I also got a side salad as well.  Funny thing, but the side salad was served in an odd shaped bowl similar to a soap dish.  It had a weird dip in it; it wasn't quite a bowl but certainly was not a dish.  I had a hard time keeping my tomatoes from squirting up over the sides, rolling off and committing tomatocide off the edge of the table (one actually did).  It wasn't a big deal, but then some French guy the next table over kept coughing up a lung like he had \"la bubonic plague\" or something, and I started to wonder if I made the right choice of dinner spots.  Then the main course came out and I was relieved.  The shrimp and grits were very good.  The grits came with cheese melted in them, and could have passed for some homemade mashed potatoes.  They also garnished the dish with arugula which gave it a zesty spice.  Last but not lease, there was plenty of shrimp to my delight.",

The beer was cold, but the large was actually smaller than the small. The chicken wings were decent, but what really moves me to write was the totally apathetic hostess crew. I've never seen a group so determined to start off a seating with a bad vibe. My hostess literally half cleaned my table and took off. I had to get napkins to wipe up the rest of the mess. I almost walked but I'm trying to be a more patient person. My waitress hustled her butt off, even cleaning up broken glass and a spill on an adjacent table because they don't have enough bussers to help her out?? Maybe get some of the flock of slow moving, straight faced hostesses to help her out?! Just saying. Won't eat here again unless I see something close to a smile from the front.",

One side is a sit down bar / restaurant and the other side is a cafe style line.  The staff has always been outstanding.  On one visit, I sat at bar.  Great service with a great smile.  I went with the shrimp and grits.  Very good and tasty.  The shrimp were large and plump.  The dish has some cheese and some kind of zesty tangy sauce.  I thought it was awesome, my only complaint, it was small.  I could probably eat two or three dishes of it!!!!  Another review has a pic.....  On another visit, I ordered the breakfast pizza.  Hand made, thin crust pizza cooked in a traditional oven.  One over easy egg was in the center of the pizza........ I actually like sitting on the cafe side, facing the oven.  The cooks were talking to me and having a great time.  I will go back!",

Spoke to a Manager and showed him the bottom of the pizza which was flimsy and under cooked. He agreed. Offered to cook me something else but I already sent 2 entrees back at that point and it was 10p. Manager did take both meals off but wouldve been nice if he had comp'd wine.

We stopped in thinking it might be a decent place to eat and were so surprised at the quality and creativity of the food we were presented.  I had the BBQ Shrimp and Grits. Folks, it's hard to impress me with grits because I'm from the South and I know what I want in grits. Guess what, this dish had the flavor. It was there! Loved it!   My wife ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta and the French Onion Soup. Boom!!!!! Best choices ever! The soup was probably one of the best French Onion soups we have had. The Chicken Pesto Pasta was delicious. We had a great evening and if it were a touch more romantic, I would give it that last star. But hey, what do you expect out of an airport restaurant.  With that said, check it out!",

Sandwiches made to order. A large selection of grab-and-go that looks amazingly awesome. There was a container of Queen Charlotte's Pimiento Cheese in there that caught my eye. Mmmmm... tasty!  And to top it all off, a large bar on the atrium side that has local brews on tap! Yep, even the award winning Hop-Drop-And-Roll and my own favorite, the Jalapeno Pale Ale. Jeez, Louise.

Because this is one of the better options at CLT.     ---   ---   ---  \"Eatin' good\" is tough to do while traveling, so I set a very low standard for meal with this pass-through: find something healthy. I chose 1897 because their mission was fresh food, and they had a few different salad options.  And then I ordered the pretzel burger because I have a problem.  My burger was solid, but I was kicking myself for passing on the french onion soup. I sat at the end of the bar, right next to the open kitchen and watched delicious french onion soup being distributed time after time after time. I will definitely be trying that out on my next visit. My parmesan fries were fine, in its place.  The only gripe I had was that during my visit, the Charlotte Hornets were playing a playoff Game 7, and the TV's were on ESPN2, which had bowling on. I asked a couple times for them to switch the TV's, but it didn't happen until about my 5 minutes before I had to leave. That may sound nit-picky, but how do you not have your local team's big playoff game on, and why does it take 15-20 minutes to change the channel?  At any rate, this will probably be my stop at future visits to the airport. Next time, I'll get the salad (and the french onion soup, of course.)",

There are limited take outs available (pizza and salads) around the back. I had the burger and parmesan fries and it was a solid choice. Next time I might have to try the dirty mac and cheese. All in all, a relaxing and pleasant spot to grab a bite in between flights. Absolutely no complaints!",

It is very appealing visually, and I was hopeful that several months into being open that they would have worked out the kinks other diners have written about. Nope.  My waitress was fine. She had to be flagged down and asked for everything, from more water to ketchup and jam. I can forgive not the best service, but not when the food is so sub par.   I ordered the basic breakfast, scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries and toast.   The plate arrived about 10-15 minutes after ordering - they were busy this morning. The eggs looked and tasted great. However, that is the end of my positive remarks on the food. The bacon was cold. Literally, cold. It felt like it had just been pulled out of the refrigerator. The potatoes were drowning in grease. I didn't touch a single one. The sour dough toast was fine, but it came dry, no jam or butter to be seen. When the plate was dropped, there wasn't a question of \"what else can I get you?\", so I had to wait for a second pass in order to ask for ketchup and jam.   Overall, they simply haven't worked out the kinks - which is such a bummer because they had such promise.",

The only thing I didn't like is they had spiraled raw beets on top but when I mentioned it to the server Trent, who by the way was amazing, he told me the chef was roasting them for me right now.

Roasted veggies with goat cheese appetizer was a nice break from airport fast food. I do wish it were hotter, but the flavors were good. I also ordered a Carved Turkey Cobb Salad, it came out in a timely fashion and hit all the right spots. Perhaps not a traditional Cobb, the carved turkey was a delicious protein, blue cheese dressing atop fresh romaine was solid. It wasn't 5 star for me, but I'm a stickler. I'd recommend passers through CLT airport at least give it a whirl.",

Now, what does one do for three hours during prime dinner hours until the next flight departs. I began looking for a place to eat.  Nothing I read about seemed appealing. I left the rocking chairs in the atrium and decided to walk around only to discover 1879 market. I looked at the menu and was surprised that they had actual food choices.  I waited for about five minutes before being seated. It was a large dining area and had a few different seating options.  I ordered the Salmon. The salmon had a nice texture and flavor but had a little to much salt for my liking. Despite the salt part, the presentation and service were the best I have ever seen/received at an airport. I would go here again and try other menu items. This place is a keeper.",

Thankfully this cute marketplace was still open and even though they were getting ready to close, the employees were still so courteous and eager to help me. I loved this place! It was super charming and I wish I could have spent more time there. They had a small area to lounge, while you drink coffee and/or read a book. This was very atypical of those run-of-the-mill airport store, where you just go in to buy a stick of gum and a newspaper. I loved how inviting this place with artisanal offerings and freshly packed food boxes for those that were on the go. If only we got in earlier and had a longer layover, I would have spent more time there. Their menus looked amazing from all the Yelp photos and of course I was left with my mouth watering. Next time at Charleston airport, note to self: visit 1897 Market, order a meal and order a cocktail! I walked away with a snack pack of fruit, cheese and crackers. Luckily it did not cost an arm & a leg and it even filled up the fams.",

The French onion soup was Luke warm and looked like it had sat under the warming lamp for some time as the cheese was dry and tough.  The French fries were also not good.  Overall between the atmosphere, the poor service and the poor food, I will not be returning to this restaurant in the future.",

I looked over their menu and found a few sandwiches that I liked and I decided to stay. I ordered the turkey sandwich, which came with roasted mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, truffle aoili sauce, and  lean turkey all on a cibatta roll. It was a very unique tasting sandwich with the truffle aoili sauce, roasted mushrooms, and the turkey. Everything came together so well and just melted in my mouth. The only  negative was that the sandwich was really small. It left me wanting more, but I couldn't get more because there was no more sandwich left!   I absolutely loved the laid back feel of 1897. Upon walking in what caught my eye was the wall, it had various drawings of sections of the pig, Julia Child's quotes, and the fact that they use real ingredients in their food. The restaurant is filled with various dried nuts, fruits, granola bars, chocolate, cookies, and other snacks to satisfy your appetite! They also have this awesome lounge with comfy and clean chairs and couches where you can chill out, charge your electronics, and take advatage of the free wifi. You can stay as long as you want!  The staff is really friendly and the food is delicious! Definitely will check out 1897 when I return to the Charlotte airport.",

    "text": "1897 Market at Charlotte-Douglas is a full service restaurant and bar that offers a modern twist on southern classics. The ambiance was rustic and country chic. Think long wooden farm tables and iron benches. My husband and I had a 90 minute layover so we had enough time to check this place out. Depending on how much time you have to spend in the airport, you have the option to eat in at their restaurant, eat at the bar, or if you were on the go like us, you can order your food to go.  Since we were eating between lunch and dinner, our linner was just two sides: Dirty Mac and Cheese which consisted of fondue beer cheese, pasta shells, pulled pork bbq shreds, carmelized onions topped with toasted breadcrumbs and their Bravas Potatoes. Their version of Bravas Potatoes is made up of roasted potatoes with paprika aioli, herbs and carmelized onions. Both dishes were absolute knockouts and combined, cost slightly less than a single main dish. We paid around $15ish for both plates to go and those were inhaled just before our plane took off!   They have a raw oyster bar and I got a chance to see a lady shucking fresh oysters right at the bar! You can order oysters by the piece or by the half dozen/dozen. They carry wines, spirits and a variety of beers on tap with a focus on local beers.  The menu is pricey but in a captured market, like an airport, expect to pay more. My take on this is, if your going to expect consumers to pay more for food and drink at the airport, you better deliver quality and a great tasting product. 1897 does just that and I was glad we had the opportunity to visit.  They are located on Concourse B near Gate B1 and there are free charging stations wrapped around the bar perimeter. Definitely worth checking out if you are in CRT.",

We came for lunch. You can either order from the To-Go deli area or be seated, which is what we opted for. The service during our trip was pretty quick. I ordered the chicken mushroom truffle sandwich (forgot the exact name) and I got really lucky because this sandwich was amazing! My husband ordered the hamburger and found it to be super tasty as well. They both came with parmesan fries which were also pretty good.  If you're stuck at the airport with a long layover, you should definitely skip McDonalds and all the other fast food places and come eat here.",

I opted for the salad substitution for fries and that was great as well (def recommend the honey walnut vinaigrette). Our server Kelly was so friendly and managed to cater to not only our every need, but the needs of everyone at the entire bar (of about a dozen or so rotating airport patrons, in varying degrees of distress, which they were clearly taking out on him). Needless to say, this was my favorite airport bar experience of my whole entire life and as much as I hope I never have to endure another, if I did, I would definitely return if only to say wassup to Kelly again",

Marinara sauce was not overpowering yet was not lacking in flavor. Bacon bits was spread nicely around so that you got that little bit of bacon crunch with each bite, as opposed to a mouthful of bacon making it a bacon pizza.   Really enjoyed it (see pic).

My research led me to 1897 Market and I'm glad -- not a bad place to stumble upon (especially when airport food tends to be overpriced, underflavored and overall boring)  I was seated fairly quickly and greeted by friendly staff. To start, I ordered a jalapeno beer. It was nice to see some local NC craft beers on their beer list.   For food, I ordered the spinach & mushroom pizza, as well as the brava potatoes. The pizza was great -- good flavors, decent size for the price (one person could eat the whole thing, but it would also be good for sharing if everyone ordered their own entree as well). The brava potatoes were a total miss, in my opinion. I've ordered similar dishes elsewhere and thought the ones here were way too dry. They were essentially potato wedges tossed in a very minimal amount of sauce. Sorry, but I'd definitely say pass on those.   The other downside is that there is no restroom inside the actual restaurant -- you have to leave and walk to another portion of the airport (which was a bummer as a solo traveler because I couldn't just leave the table mid-meal to find a restroom)  The menu had a lot of variety and there were a few other dishes that piqued my curiosity. If I ever find myself in this airport again, I'd certainly come back to check out more of the offering.",

There was live music, which added to the whole experience!  I ordered brussel sprouts to start and then steak frites.  Brussel sprouts: Interesting balsamic taste on the sprouts, could have done without the parenesab cheese. None of the brussel sprouts were crunchy but some where \"dryer\" than others, some got a little softer because of the glaze on the top.  Fries- (least favorite part of the meal) Texture was a bit soft and not very crunchy on the outside. Parmesan taste on the fries was overwhelming, they put a lot of cheese one there was a pile sitting on the bottom of my plate .  The steak was tender (I ordered mine medium) and juicy! The green pesto sauce that came on the side was great too! The steak with the pesto sauce was the highlight of the meal!",

I've eaten here twice and that seems to be the norm, not the exception. I had a great grilled veggie omelet and my husband had some of the fluffier pancakes I've seen a while.   Average airport prices rein here and the tables are not so close you can't drag your luggage through them.",

I was seated adjacent to a take out area and advised my server would be along...many servers walked around and milled about and I waited for mine. The wait was not extreme but definitely longer than it needed to be. The selection was not extensive but I ordered a French onion soup and roasted vegetables. Both were just a little more than lukewarm and the French onion soup was greatly over salted. I only ate about half of my meal. I would have alerted my server except that she never came by to check on my meal and had to ask one of the other servers to ask her to bring my bill. And, I also had to wait for that for longer than necessary. When she did I advised that the food was below par and her manager gave me a 10% discount. The whole experience was disappointing.",

I walked in and wasn't greeted and when I finally caught someone's eye and let them know I wanted to dine in, they pointed over towards the other side of the room and said I needed to see the hostess stand.   Mmmmkay.  I start making my way over, the place is fairly large, a mish mash of market, quick eats and dining. I saw a server that was standing by what looked like a hostess stand and asked if they had any tables for me. He told me I had to check at the hostess stand. Really? I was one of the seven people in the entire joint besides servers and there was a minimum of twenty empty tables. I'm not even exaggerating. This irked me because I feel like he could've been proactive and sat me but I've never worked in a restaurant so maybe there is some super secret squirrel way of seating people that requires you to go to the host stand first to check in then be seated. I complied and walked over to the hostess stand. She barely said hello and sat me. And guess who helped me? The original server that told me I had to see the hostess to snag one of the twenty open tables. Pfft.  I was finally seated and ordered the Carolina Slam. Loved the sharp white cheddar on the grits-cheesy heaven. The eggs and bacon were perfect and the arugula they topped it with was unexpected but damn good.   But, this review is about the entire experience not just the food. Otherwise, it would've been easy to post a solid 4 stars. The service was pretty mediocre. After ordering, my food was brought over by another server, without asking if I needed condiments, another drink, more napkins....then, I sat there for 25 minutes without being acknowledged. It wasn't that the servers I interacted with were rude or mean, they were just a little clueless or unmotivated. At least that was my vibe. I didn't feel very welcome or that my business was appreciate. Such a bummer because the food was good and the space is pretty cool with A LOT of power outlets. It's like a traveler's dream! But, until they get their service right, I'll won't be coming back.",

Add on some worse than average service and it equals one star. You are better off at literally any other option in the Charlotte airport.",

All the manager could say was I'm sorry, and then offered me a soup to go.  Thanks bro.  Incompetent employees are the evidence of incompetent leadership, and you Sir have an incompetent staff of folks who really could care less.  Glad I still had to pay for the drink I had while waiting.....",

Ordered an Old Fashioned, which was good, but overpriced (it is an airport after all) and the barbecue shrimp and grits, which were excellent!  The portion wasn't huge, but it doesn't need to be.  Service was also very good. Would rate this as 5 stars if the drink wasn't $15.50",

The menu was small but had a great selection and I settled on the French Onion Soup and a Seared Salmon Salad. If this review was based solely on the food it would be a 5. The soup was great, but the salad was absolutely amazing.   Unfortunately the service was disappointing. After waiting almost 10 mins in a half empty restaurant someone finally stopped to see if I had been help. Thankfully he decided to take care of my order, brought my drink and fairly quickly brought my dinner and promptly disappeared.   I still recommend based on the food, but caution that you not stop unless you have at least an hour.",

They wouldn't even sell me two eggs. You can apparently add them to sandwiches, but not have them by themselves. Seeing as I didn't want to order a burger and throw away the sandwich just to eat an egg, I find myself eggless this morning. It makes absolutely no sense to me. The local beer was good though. Typically it's nice to work with your customers. Especially when they may be traveling and denied having eggs for breakfast!",

From the hostess who actually smiled when I walked up (how refreshing is that!), to the waitress who was attentive but not obnoxiously so, this restaurant is impressive. You can do sit down or take out. A lovely lounge and bar area. I chose sit down service since my flight was cancelled. So glad I did. Late afternoon Farmhouse Salad with chicken hit the spot along with a delicious cocktail. Salad and chix very fresh with a light dressing. Many interesting offerings. Ask for Chantae- lovely wait person. Hope this place  stays around. Will return on next CLT flight. The only thing missing is desserts, but they are working on that. Thank you!!!",

The atmosphere is friendly, with all of the employees being laid back, seeming like they were having fun and enjoying working here. I love the dynamic and down to earth atmosphere.
