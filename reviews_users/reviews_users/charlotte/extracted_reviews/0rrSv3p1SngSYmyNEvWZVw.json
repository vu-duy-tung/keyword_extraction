It was pretty late and I wanted a quick bite, looks like most of the staff had left but he said we would be open staying open till the end of the game at least. I figured the kitchen was closed but asked for a sandwich any way and the bartender and manager opened up the kitchen to make me a sandwich. This is the customer service I have been looking for in this area for a long time. This is my 2nd review but Tap Haus 49 is doing what a restaurant should do but often don't. Thank you and keep up the good work !!!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did last night with my family, unfortunately we were underwhelmed! I came to try the lobster hush puppies and pesto pasta. We were seated immediately but that was the only thing that was prompt. We waited over 25 minutes for the appetizer. They no longer serve the pesto pasta so we ordered chicken finger kids meal, blackened shrimp pasta, and the cheesesteak entree. After the appetizer finally came out we waited an additional 20+ minutes for our entrees. My 6 yr. old daughter was starving and complained the entire time as we waited. We could never find our waitress to inquire where our food was and to get more water. This seemed to be the issue with all the surrounding tables as they were looking around as well for their waitresses. When the food finally came, my husband and I were both disappointed. The blackened shrimp pasta lacked seasoning as well as the cheesesteak sandwich, which was also dry and tough. The fries, while a sufficient amount, were cold. The lobster hush puppies could use more lobster and seasoning as well; the honey sauce that comes with is was a nice compliment but overshadowed the actual hush puppy. The portion of the kids meal was good as well as the atmosphere but definitely wasn't worth the $50+.",

I was waiting for a friend to meet me, so I chose to sit at the bar. The Bartenders Curtis and Rachel were professional and made sure I had what I needed. I tried some fresh cut fries and a Margarita Pizza, it was pretty yummy. To drink I had a local, cider and beer. My first impression was good. I will definitely go back soon!",

Since we'd already been there over an hour with 2 young children, we cut our losses and left.  The manager took $20 off our bill, though we still left hungry and disappointed.  Service team seemed disorganized on a somewhat crowded Saturday night.  Would like to return and try the food... maybe we should try a weeknight dinner instead. :/",

After the manager took the order for our entrees and got me a new beer (my original glass had a huge chip in it), we saw our server once more during our dinner. Our food was good, but I can make good food at home, I go out to eat to not have to worry about things like this. The manager never came back to make sure we got everything sorted out. The restaurant was not busy, it was a Thursday night, but by the way the (over staffed) restaurant was acting, you'd think it was an overpacked Friday. We were excited for the prospect of a locally owned restaurant, but it doesn't live up to the hype. It seems like the restaurant isn't too concerned about disappointed customers, so we'll be taking our business elsewhere.   Also, don't be fooled by some of the reviews on Yelp and Facebook by people who work at this restaurant. Don't be surprised if you see some familiar faces when you stop in!",

All of it.  1st I order the Margarita flatbread. What came out was a floppy, completely over sauced thing.  Each square has a thick slice of beefsteak tomato & a glob of mozzarella on it. Give that a sprinkling of dried basil. To make it seem wood fired I guess they grilled the flatbread which just made it taste burnt on the grill marks.  I sent it back.  Next, the burger: nothing special about it. It was eatable though and I was starving. Over cooked (I asked for medium) greasy, and nothing special.  I look at the menu & it's just all over the place. That tells me everything is frozen & just plopped in fryers &/or the grills.  It's plain boring generic food.     I wanted to be excited for this place, but I won't be back unless I stop for a beer to wait out traffic on the way home and to better places.",

The service was fast and the food was very tasty. We shared the pretzels with beer cheese and stone ground mustard as an appetizer. AMAZING. I had the turkey and Brie panini. AMAZING. My boyfriend had the European burger. AMAZING. We shared a side of the crispy Brussels sprouts. AMAZING.  Are you seeing the trend here? For desert we shared the fried Oreos. You guessed it... AMAZING!! We will definitely be back!! I hope this place is here forever!!",

I also ordered some bourbon maple wings and as I was about to bite into one of my wings ... I found a hair. I told my server and her response was simply ...\"Ok\". And I heard nothing from the server or the manager. I then addressed the server due to the lack of response . The manager finally came over and kept asking specifics regarding the hair... not sure why it matters ... specifics ... it was a hair!  I don't see the reason to plant a hair to benefit from $7 wings lol I feel with the constant questioning .. that was the assumption. All and all save your money for a better establishment with better service.",

I should've asked to change servers so it wouldn't put a damper on things but the spicy chicken sandwich was dry and the portion of beer cheese was too small.  Maybe I will give TH49 some time and try again in a few months.   Shelby, please take notes on how the other servers interacted with their customers and I promise you will make more in tips!",

My son had the egg and cheese sandwich with bacon and cheese grits and it was such a huge portion we had to take half of the sandwich home. He is 11 and usually a bottomless pit, so that says a lot about the portion size. My youngest had the kids waffles and fruit cup and cleaned her plate. This is a newer restaurant so not many people know about it or their yummy brunch on the weekends. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a bite to eat in the Steele Creek area.",

Loved them.   Tuna tacos: good but only three to share? Should make it 4. Also minced garlic is too much. Took away from the other flavors  MEAL:  Hot chicken sandwich: it was dry and the fries were cold. Had to return it. The next batch was much better and the piece of chicken was bigger. However, the fries were really salty. We had to knock off the salt.   Blue foot burger:  overall the burger was ok. The angus burger itself had no taste. The sweet potatoes had sweet sauce that was too much sweetness.   So the experience was ok. It would have been nice to comp the hot chicken but they didn't. The manager didn't even check on us.  There were only 5 tables seated.   If you are looking for a similar place with better quality food, I would suggest Coppers Pub a few miles down the road.",

Wife and I stopped in this past Saturday, since we live very close.  Decor (exterior and interior) and concept is an improvement from Tilted Kilt.  We certainly welcome a restaurant whose central theme is not young girls with push-up bras.  The food is very average.  Wife had a chicken sandwich, while I had one of their burgers.  We waited an extraordinary long time for a very simple meal at a time when there were few customers.  Wife ordered Brussel sprouts as a side, but her meal came with fries instead. Waitress realized the mistake and brought us two sides for the error. Appears this is primarily a beer joint with food being a secondary item.  They will certainly get traffic during football season, but the real test will be surviving afterwards.  We do want the restaurant to survive for the sake of neighborhood appeal, but I suspect it will experience the same demise as the other 2 restaurants in the same location unless there is an improvement in the food.  I will drive to Hickory Tavern rather than taking another chance here.  Lastly, found it interesting that my credit card charge read Tilted Kilt.",

The eggs Benedict was the best that I have ever had. My wife and daughter and I enjoyed our meals very much. Next, the service was exceptional, from the greeting by the co-owner to the service by the staff. The care by the staff was exceptional and friendly. This restaurant is one of the few that has good coffee. The owner told me that the coffee is their own. The company is located on Staten Island, New York, ant the coffee is roasted and blended to their specification, and the quality shows.  The TapHaus serves brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., and the menu serves both meals. An adult drink menu is available if you so desire.  For a great way to start your weekend, I highly recommend the TapHaus.",

Probably my favorite I've had on the menu. Garlic fries were delicious and although the I didn't have the wings they looked really good! My girlfriend said they were delicious. I had a chicken sandwich and I was a tad bit disappointed it was just over cooked and dry I'd imagine that it wasn't over cooked it would be really good. All in all I'd come back",

    "text": "From the moment that we walked into Tap Haus 49 we were immersed in a sense of wholesomeness and welcoming ambiance. We were completely unprepared for meeting our waitress Tyra for her unbelievable and incredibly rare passion and flare for people. Throughout the entire experience she never wavered from this sense of being and she had such an effortless ability to give the best of best customer service, accommodating and exceeding each and every expectation or need that a patron could ever need when dining. Her charisma and impeccable capability's were wonderfully paired with the other staffing as they worked together as a team with a clearly like mindset of delivering the best service experience possible to their customers that they never hesitated to lend an extra hand to one another, not to mention with such efficiency and finesse. As if that were not enough we were blessed enough to have arrived on a night that they were hosting a live jazz musician that sent the experience and ambiance to the next level. Most importantly when it came time for the food to arrive we could not believe the artisanal quality and uniquely beautiful pairings of flavors. We started with an appetizer of seasonal humus and pimento cheese fritter with an amazing pineapple-habanero jam. The Humus was of plentiful quantity without worry of running out of the soft  grilled pita and the pimento fritters were so fresh and sensational that they simply just melted in your mouth with an explosion of taste and sensations. When the main course came it was presented in such a way that we were simply in awe. The salmon was uniquely presented on freshly charred cedar plank that description could never fully describe the spectrum of flavor and never have I had such a freshly made, well constructed meatless burger - the clean eater. Even the attention to the smallest of details as adding a lemon and oregano seasoning to the fries continued to add to the vast palate that they offered. So often we get lost in the everyday experience of the one size fits all dinning experience that the industry has forgotten or lost it's flare for the luxury that is dinning out. What Tap Haus 49 has done is create an atmospheric experience with impeccable ambiance, favorable artisan quality food, incomparable service, and at a reasonably affordable price range. This is an experience that I look forward to visiting again and again especially with Tyra, anytime and whenever we are visiting the area. We without hesitation offer our recommendation to those looking to truly experience dining out as it should always be.",

    "text": "Not sure what happened to the old Tilted Kilt... again, but now it's TapHaus 49. I guess the craft beer bandwagon is still going strong. In all honesty, the decor is much, much better than the previous theme. It also feels much cleaner and welcoming.  it's still a generic sports bar with a visual and auditory assault of whatever Trogolite vs Neanderthal event is going on at the time. The layout of the entire place is nearly identical as before, so the familiarity was welcoming.  They have a respectable selection of craft beer, so we sat down and ordered our beers. I ordered a lager and the barely-legal bartender places in front of me a jet-black (albeit beautiful) pint of beer. I asked her if she poured the right thing as lagers are typically yellow in color. She looked back at the tab and apologize as they'd kicked the beer I wanted and she didn't realize it. No biggie, I kept the beer and still enjoyed it.  We had a couple more beers, the girls came over to have a small casual convo with us. All pretty standard, uneventful stuff. It was a pleasant visit and when I'm in the area, I will visit again... but not make a special trip just to visit.",

Order took 41 minutes to arrive...yes we were starving. Order arrives and server advises that its on regular bun  from kitchen and i can just not eat the bread. I advised if she's aware that it you ask for gluten free they cannot just come back with regular buns...as someone can have an adverse reaction....she said she know and just leaves. . I took off the bread. Two minutes later she comes with \"gluten free bread\".. She blamed everything on the kitchen...there were only patrons at the bar. Then she disappears again.

The reason I give it 5 stars, is the owner will immediately come see you and rectify any wrong doings. The servers are amazing, and they will do whatever it takes to make you happy.  I can say this. Their steak salad is to die for. Cooked perfectly. Steak is hot and salad is ice cold.   It's a awesome atmosphere, with great sections and great food.

Bar food and lots of televisions are the order of the day now, though there are a few things that are unusual. Sauteed mussels and lobster hushpuppies and a bone-in pork chop, for instance. And then salads and burgers and mac & cheese and flatbreads. All looking good, with a beer list just as long.  Meeting a friend for lunch and not drinking beer as it's a work day, I went to the \"Blue Foot\" burger, bunless. This is a short rib and brisket beef blend with mushrooms and blue cheese and arugula. Quite tasty and I subbed out the \"lemon oregano fries\" for an order of broccolini.  I'm a fan.

They have an excellent variety of craft beer. I enjoyed the Wicked Weed Watermelon and hubs had Legion Juicy J. For dinner, I had the spinach salad with shrimp and it was awesome! Just the right size and very fresh. My husband had the Hot Chicken and devoured it. The large projection screen was great to watch some preseason football. The interior is decorated nicely and is a huge upgrade from the Tilted Kilt. I am so glad we found this amazing place and we can't wait to return!",

    "text": "This was my first time trying this restaurant. It's fairly new and I was excited to give the menu a shot.   When we arrived the hostess was texting on her phone and made sure to finish what she was doing before acknowledging that we were there. In fact, the other hostess who was cleaning menus saw her on her phone and had to stop what she was doing and greet us. We were seated in the back and it was extremely chilly. There was very cold air blowing onto the tables.   We ordered our food and I got the fig and prosciutto flatbread and we split the lobster hush puppies as an appetizer. The hush puppies were good. The sauce they come in is like a mildly spicy honey mixture. It comes with 5 pups. The flatbread came out looking lovely. I asked for my prosciutto extra crispy, which it was not, but still tasted good. I love the idea of the flatbread. The flavors are great together and the bread was very crisp and delicious. The only issue was there was WAY too much fig on it. It was overwhelmingly sweet, even for me and I'm a sweet fan. I had to scrape most of it off and put my toppings back on. It even made the bread a little soggy after sitting.   My friend ordered fries that I tasted and they were awful. Rosemary and garlic was on the description, but they were literally bland and plain skinny fries.   The waiter was nice, but extremely slow. He enjoyed spending time chatting with other employees rather than make sure he was serving customers.   Nice atmosphere, drink specials looked good, and live band playing, it does have potential.",

I was really looking forward to trying this place. For a Tuesday night they were pretty busy. They had live music and all the TVs on a sports channel.  When I walked in the hostess was texting, she never even looked up at us. So we waited...and finally another sever greeted us and got the hostess's attention so we could be seated.   I decided to go with the Haus burger and garlic and rosemary fries. Meh. The fries were not good. They didn't have any garlic or rosemary flavor. And they arrived cold. When I asked for another order, they were also not flavored and cold. How?   The burger was a little too undercooked for my liking but that's just my personal preference. The service was a bit slow too, we had a hard time trying to get his attention and he didn't come back and check on us until it was time to bring the bill.   Meh. I just wasn't impressed with this place.",

To my surprise they had only been open for a few weeks from what my waitress told me. The staff here are exceptionally friendly. Tap Haus 49 is simply a bar with bar food nothing more nothing less. One thing I can say is apparently the drinks are super strong I ordered the rise up martini and I swear all I tasted was the alcohol for the most part so if you're one for strong drinks then umm yea this is the place to go. I chose an appetizer due to the fact I wasn't really hungry just being greedy I chose the sweet n spicy lobster hush puppies and I must admit they were pretty darn good I couldn't stop swirling my hushpuppies around in the sauce they were drenched in .  I love the fact they have flat screens everywhere even outside on the outside patio. This will be a great neighborhood spot to go and watch the game and have drinks and appetizers with friends .",

They have tons of TVs all over along with pool tables, darts, and some other games. We were seated right away.   We started with an order of the sweet and spicy lobster hush puppies and the pimento cheese fritters. The hush puppies were amazing and the fritters were pretty good too.  For entrees, we wanted to get the banh mi flatbread, but they were out of pork belly which was disappointing. We got the fig and prosciutto flatbread instead along with the hot chicken sandwich and garlic rosemary fries. The flatbread was good, but it was burnt on half of it and the topping portions were off. There was so much fig and balsamic that it was overwhelmingly sweet. The hot chicken sandwich was very disappointing. The piece of chicken was tiny and very dry.   I think this place has a lot of potential, but their food definitely needs some fine tuning. I would definitely give it another chance.   This would be a great place to hang out on game day, but as of right now, I wouldn't seek it out for the food.",

Ordered some Pinot Grigio wasn't the best Our bill was $130 which I wasn't anticipating but I didn't feel we really ordered too much or drank too much for that type of bill. We went there on a Friday at 5:30 because we were hitting up Carowinds right after and its right down the street. Locations easy to find. All in all its okay I would go back but only if I was in the neighborhood and starving.",

To be fair, I think this was their first full week of operation. And one thing that made up for most of my disappointments was that one of the owners stopped by our table to talk to us (unsolicited). He asked us how it was and listened attentively as we told him areas they needed to improve. Then he comp'ed a drink for us.   Areas they did really good on:                 -The food was excellent. I had the Hot Chicken sandwich with Brussel Sprouts side. This was amazing. My wife had the wings and garlic fries. Very good.                 -They had a pretty nice selection of local craft beer, including about 8 IPA's. Very nice.                 -They had lots of football games on, with big screen TV's   Let's look at the areas they missed:                 -Service was slow. The wait staff seemed confused about where the tables were. We sat for about 15 minutes before a waitress came by and asked, have you been waited on? Nope...She was very nice and apologetic and did a good job thereafter.                 -The kitchen was very slow. The owner said he chef was out this week, maybe that explained part of it. But we waited a long time for our food.                 -The place seems unusually loud. I had the same experience in this building years ago when I came under a different restaurant.                 -They served by really nice Local Craft IPA in the Bud Light glass-the horror! I tried to turn the label away so I couldn't see it, but I think it still impacted by enjoyment of my beer. J   Overall, I give them a 3 star, with high hopes for the future.",

I stopped by for a quick lunch on the way to an event, so I just ordered an app as my meal.  The first thing I noticed was how my the bartender placed a napkin down on the bar in front of me as a sort of placemat.  This was such a small, but brilliant gesture.  It definitely gave my little dining space a classy and clean feel.  I went with Panang Egg app for my meal.  I was curious to see how this (not very Asian themed) venue would present a curry.  I was pleasantly surprised!!  The two generous slabs of pork belly perfectly complemented the sweet fried/tempura egg that sat on top of a beautiful bed of jasmine rice.  The curry was my favorite part.  With the sweet tempura egg and salty juicy pork belly, the light spicy coconut was all I needed.  The app was hearty enough to fill me up and the dish was so perfectly balanced flavor-wise.  The Spirit Away was alright.  Casamigos is one of my fave tequilas, so already, the cocktail was set up for success with this liquor as its base.  However, part of what drew me in was the muddled blackberries in the drink, and unfortunately the bar didn't have the actual fruit.  Also, the basil was served as a garnish, when I was hoping it would've maybe been muddled in for flavor.  Overall, my experience was a really good one, and next time I'm on this side of town, I just might drop back in!",

I asked for a Beer list and they said oh we don't have that but we do have $3.50 16oz taps. I said oh cool what do you have she names some like Miller Lite, PBR, Coors, and Blue Moon. I said ok give me a Blue Moon a couple minutes later she comes back and says sorry we don't have Blue Moon anymore. I guess I could see them running out of beer if it was busy and they weren't called a Tap Haus. I am also confused what Tap Haus sells only domestic beers. I ended up drink water and my partner ended up with a god awful glass of Pinot Grigio and there wasn't even a sorry. We ordered the lobster hush puppies which tasted like sand as an appetizer and a hot chicken sandwich which tasted less than par. I ordered chicken tenders because everything else seemed like I would be taking a risk if I order and what can I say how can you mess up chicken tenders. After the first visit I personally won't be back nor would I recommend it.",

    "text": "This is appears to be a cute place to grab drinks, when I went with a group of friends it was pretty dead though. Service was below par. One of the people at my table found a hair in her wings and the server failed to acknowledge it at all. More so, the \"manager\" came to our table asking us what color the hair was, etc. as if the person who found the hair, placed it within her $7 wings and then never offered to replace the food or anything....the mimosas were \"okay\"...the orange juice tasted really weird, so ask for other flavors. I'm giving two stars because my steak n frites were fine but I wouldn't recommend coming here again, there are way better places you could go.",

The fries blew me away, after seeing other reviews I think they may have upped the flavors bc you could definitely taste the rosemary! Very nice staff as well, we had a good time and will return!",

He was so personable and nice. We will be back time and time again!! A++ we'll be sure to ask for Anthony to be our server he was on point even though I spilled my water.",

    "text": "This place is horrible . Don't bother wasting your money. I ordered the salmon entree. And it came with jasmine rice. They told me they ran out of rice and had to make a new batch . Then my dish came out with rice . The rice was dry and hard like it hadn't been cooked at all. The salmon tasted slimy. My daughter had also ordered a side of rice. It never came out and at the end when it was time to pay the waiter still the rice on the receipt. He didn't even know that her rice never came out. The new batch of rice That was promised was never made. Waiters should know what their customers have ordered and whether they got all their food. My sons chicken fingers were disgusting. Overall, very unsatisfied.",

This is the first place that I've been in months that has actually cooked my burger medium.  As great as the burger was, I was super satisfied with the Brussels sprouts as a side.  They were amazing.  My companion had the fries, and they were also good, but the shoestring variety.  That isn't a knock on the fries, it's just my personal preference is for the steak fry variety.  The service was good and beer selection varied.  We will definitely be back!",

Nashville hot chicken sandwich was really good, but the grilled chicken sandwiches were over cooked and very dry. Also fairly small piece of chicken for the cost.",

    "text": "Went for dinner on a Sunday around 4:40 p.m.  We sat in the bar area at a table.  The bartender was not that busy, as there were 4 people at the bar.  He poured our drinks and left them sitting on the bar for the waitress to come while he walked around the bar singing to the music.  We received our drinks 10 minutes later.  Our waitress appeared extremely busy as she would run into the restaurant and then disappear into the kitchen for awhile.  There appeared to be one bartender, one cook (we could see into the kitchen) and two waitresses.  The place was not busy.  I would hate to see them on a really busy day, yikes.  Our food was cold.  We ordered regular fries and our orders came out with lemon oregano seasoning.  We all ordered sandwiches and they were also cold.  The \"herb roasted turkey\" panini sounded delicious on the menu, but was actually deli turkey with toppings.  So yes, we have had better and won't be back.",

    "text": "Our visit started out well. Friendly staff, greeted and seated quickly. Great for watching football or other sports. We ordered some wings and the pretzels for appetizers. And ordered our meals. It took an incredible amount of time to receive our appetizers and when they finally made it, there was a large black hair in the pretzel appetizer. Obviously accidents happen. But we were surprised there was no reduction in price considering we had to wait for a new appetizer to come out and then basically received it with our meals. Biggest pet peeve. Why order an appetizer if it's just going to come out with the meals? Once the appetizer was correct it was good. However, all four of our meals were subpar at best. Just lots of missteps. I had the fig and prosciutto flatbread and it was just drenched in balsamic. Balsamic is one of those things that are delicious but not to be overdone. After completing our meals we waited awhile for our waitress to return and we finally had to flag down a passing staff member to get our check. I think this place has potential but really needs some help.",
