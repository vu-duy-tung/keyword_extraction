We were greeted with a very nice waitress who was prompt and polite, I ordered the revolutionary roast beef roll and I must say I was actually impressed with this roll. The flavors hit your mouth in perfect order....it wasn't loose and it wasn't tight...I feel like Goldie locks when I say it was just right.  I think one of the best things about our experience is that the waitress asked if we were doing well at all the right times, unlike other places where they ask you as your trying to choke down your last bite to answer...NOTE TO SERVERS....people hate that....if someone has food in their mouth all you have to do in show you came by lol...anyway this was a perfect place mid day to have an intermitten meeting ...thank you mortimers...you never disappoint",

    "text": "OK so this place is cool and very nice.  It is a 3 star place I feel, but I threw on the extra star because they use Boar's Head deli meats in all their sandwiches.  This makes a huge difference.  I am very picky and do not like slimy turkey and the like so this really made a big difference and very noticeable if you eat at other sports bar type places, not just in Charlotte, but anywhere.    Everyone was very friendly and felt like could be at home in here.  I feel like I would come here with friends for an informal dinner as it's truly a pub.  I wound not bring the grandparents for a 'nice' dinner here if you know what I mean.  I tried the chili here too and I have to say I liked the chili better across the street at Carolina's Ale House.  It was just a little to watery for me, but not horrible.  I got a panini and it was very good.  Menu is very large with so many specialty sandwiches and panini's.  I very much look forward to going back and trying more items.",

The staff is friendly and the owners are involved in the success of the place! The menu is creative and good. Went with a recommendation and one of their signature sandwiches; the Diaw. Roast Beef panini with swiss and au jus on the side. So flavorful...highly recommend. A True pub feel in the heart of the young & dumb environment of the other bars in the Epicentre. I'll be back for sure and so should you :)",

In fact, nothing about the restaurant really jumps out, but it is always a good place for a late night snack. The music is great (lots of stuff I remember from the late 90s, early 00s) and not as loud as it used to be. Maybe they listened to Yelp on that one ;-). The food is consistently good, and the drink specials are ridonculously cheap. $2 beer in a place that doesn't smell like frat-boy urine? Yes please!",

Luckily, I happen to like 80's music!  I had the French Dip sandwich (can't remember the exact name of it).  I can honestly say that it was probably the best French Dip I have ever had.  The bread was good, the beef was rare, and the au jus had just a hint of spiciness to it.  The sandwich was served with kettle chips, but you have your choice of other sides like potato salad as well.  Very good lunch, nothing too fancy, just right!",

Their menu is surprisingly large and has a great selection.. it didn't look like your typical bar menu. The bartenders are friendly and introduce themselves to you. It seems like a good portion of the clientele here are  semi-regulars, which says A LOT about a place in the Epicentre. Mortimer's is much smaller than all of the bigger bars, like Black Finn, but it makes it much more enjoyable. There is a small roped-off patio section right out front in the cobble stones of the Epicentre where you can do some pretty amazing people-watching. They also have some pretty solid drink specials here. Heads up: I am pretty sure that they get very busy for happy hour and prime time Epicentre times, so the atmosphere could be very different in those times compared to other down times.. but they are both fun!",

I would love to comment on the food but I have only abided by the liquid diet each time I have gone.   Mort's has a real nice size wrap around bar that is very spacious and inviting.  The staff is very \"dive\" and really down to earth sweet.  The on-tap selection is a little lacking but they have a ton of local bottles to roll the dice on.  They do pour an excellent Guinness!  Stop in and give this place a try.  Then keep walking around the Epicentre for more!  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

Now, I admit I may be gauging this on the idea that I hit this place on the equivalent of Super Bowl Sunday around here: race weekend in the Epicentre? Locals would know better, I didn't. But at the very least, I can say I ventured into the belly of the beast for what turned out to be a couple of beers and a BLT.  I've since come to understand a couple of what appear to be semi-universal CLT truisms: if it's race week here, expect things to be crowded and loud. And if you're in the Epicentre on race week, expect to be in the middle of loads of corresponding activity. That said, the arrangement here is fine: lots of wrap-around bar, cafe tables and a small outside patio area (so as to take in the festivities). They're doing things by-the-book with the flat screens and some unchallenging menu items, and my guess is that the regulars who stop in are looking for something a little predictable. And predictable would have been fine. If standard was more along the lines of what I was craving.",

    "text": "So apparently between 3-4 PM in uptown most places think I should not eat. My friend and I decided to wander around uptown on Sunday to get some food and see what went on during the day on a Sunday (spoiler alert: nothing). We wandered around and found out that a lot of places do not like to feed people during that time, so we found ourselves at the Epicenter due to poor planning, and then at Mortimers.   We got wings and fried mac-and-cheese bites for appetizers, I ordered a wrap with no tomatoes. The appetizers were great, and we had high hopes for our meal. I got my sandwich and..wait, I didn't order a sandwich. I ordered a wrap and that sandwich has tomatoes. They apologize, then bring out my wrap. It had tomatoes. No big deal, I'll just take them out. Except the wrap was grilled, like put on a panini press grilled, so the tomato is all up in there and I decide that I just don't want to eat that wrap anymore. I tell our very sweet waitress what happened and she is very apologetic. I asked my friend how their sandwich was, it wasn't very good, so instead I ate the side salad and the rest of those mac-and-cheese bites and called it a day.   As a side note I'm not sure why I try things at the Epicenter at all really, it's never very good. Also the Epicenter weirds me out because I have no idea what people are supposed to do there except get hammered.",

    "text": "In an effort to walk off our disgustingly large valentines day dinner we decided to head over to the Epicenter and try out a few bars.   Our first stop was Mortimer's.   The atmosphere is great. The live band that night was absolutely phenomenal, good selection of drinks and beers on tap. Not too busy. A younger professional crowd which is ideal for me. Mortimer's was a pleasant experience unless interaction is necessary with the bartenders. So there is an implied value that you will pay 11 dollars for a drink which is totally cool, but the service is an absolute nightmare. Maybe it was a off night, but if I want to close my tab and it's such a daunting task that you have to sigh and roll your eyes... It's beyond me. Aside from that I would definitely give Mortimer's another go in the future.",

    "text": "The rents were in town this weekend, and after giving them a tour of Charlotte we were getting a bit famished. My father is a picky eater, so when I saw Mortimer's Menu is made up of tons of fresh sandwiches, I knew it would be a safe bet to grab some lunch. Mortimer's didn't only impress the rents but it also made me quite the happy camper.  Located in the Epicenter, Mortimer's looks like a sports bar/ pub, but the menu is that of a high-end cafe/ deli. There were a few outdoor tables, but we decided to eat inside to escape the heat for a bit. There are some half booths and high top tables (as well as the bar), and we were greeted and seated at one of the high tops. Unlike other bar-esque restaurants I've eaten in, these high top chairs were not only easily accessible but were also surprisingly comfy. After ordering drinks we took in the ambiance of the place which consisted of TVs and silly pro-booze signs and quotes along the wall.  As I already mentioned, the menu is more extensive than I expected. There are tons of different sandwiches ranging from simple cold cuts to grilled chicken. There were regular sandwiches, wraps and paninis, as well as some salads to help round out the menu. The prices ranged from $8-10 per sandwich which isn't too shabby for the high-quality sandwich and side you get.  I went with the Roast Beef on Weck, which is kind of like a French Dip roast beef sandwich but on a special caraway seed bun instead of the hoagie roll. The roast beef was pretty high quality and came on the bun all warmed up from a hot bath in au jus. The sandwich also came with a generous portion of au jus for dipping, and the container was actually large enough to accommodate the sandwich. The au jus was divine and really made the sandwich...it was full of rich, beefy goodness. The caraway seed bread was sopped up the au jus perfectly and made for an all around great sandwich. I got the fruit salad as a side and it was a large portion of  FRESH cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple and strawberries. All in all, it was a great lunch.  The miss' had the Presto Chicken Pesto which had grilled chicken with roasted peppers and pesto. Now I didn't think I liked pesto, but I did try a dollop of hers, and then went ahead and stole a few other tastes. It was pretty darn tasty, and now I'm bugging her to make some fresh pesto so I can get the full pasta experience. My mom had the Veggie Pita which was just a bunch of veggies in a pita.I need some meat with my meal so this wasn't my cup of tea, but my mom was pretty happy.   My dad, being his boring self, went with the \"Your Grinder\", which is just a \"make your own plain sandwich.\" He got turkey, added some veggies and mayo and that was it. I shook my head in disappointment as he had this incredibly diverse menu of gourmet sammies to choose from and he went with the most basic of all. Still, he was raving about his sandwich in the end so more power to him and his bland  palate I suppose.   The sandwiches were all really good, the menu was extensive, the staff was friendly and the prices were down-right affordable for the quality. I don't know how it would be on a busy weekend night, but for a quick and tasty lunch downtown, it's the way to go. If it's lunch time and I'm in the area with a hankering for some meat on bread, this is the place I'd go. It's definitely my favorite sandwich joint  down here so far.",

When I asked for a bottled beer menu the waitress pointed to a shelf across the bar with bottles displayed on it... (I am brand centric and have amazing eyesight, but that's not the point). We ordered, after she dropped the drinks, we gave her a credit card and asked to start a tab. She ran the card and dropped the check on the table. Never asked how we were, if we wanted anything else, no thank you, nothing. It's a shame because we might have gotten another round, and she would have made more money. But instead we left and I wouldn't go back.",

Initially had a pretty crummy impression of this place after walking through during some crawl a while back. Just awful service at the time.

Now given this was a Sunday night so I still have yet to see how they operate during a standard Friday or Saturday night, but I was impressed with service and correspondence thusfar. Still have yet to try their food.    Suppose it's always good when your CM vouches for management too.",

Their wings are about the best I have ever had.  Sorry that place that rhymes with DW3 - these guys have you beat hands down with their wings.

    "text": "My friends and I were browsing around the epicenter to find a decent place to eat without a long wait on a busy Saturday night (7:30pm). Luckily, we were seated within 15 minutes at Mortimers and greeted by our super friendly server, Brittastic (I'm just quoting the receipt).   The menu here is huge and unfortunately, there weren't too many recommendations on Yelp (I guess people come here more for the social drinking, which I can attest to the fact that it is a nice place to do such a thing). We started off with a disco fries (a.k.a. poutine) as an appetizer. It was tasty but could have used more cheese! Also, the fries... well let's just say they were reminiscent of McDonalds. For my entree, I ordered the chicken BBQ panini with a caesar salad (~$9) and a pink lemonade martini. When you order your sandwich/panini, don't forget to ask for a pickle on the side! It's free and although it's hardly a specialty there, it goes well with sandwiches. The panini was nice and toasty on the outside and successfully cured my craving for barbecue sauce.  The caesar salad was your typical--not good, not bad, tasted like how it was supposed to. My friends also recommend the Beef on Weck. I must have misread the martini on yelp but when I ordered it they were able to make something ($5 shot of citron on Saturdays + $2 fee for martini). It was tasty and not too strong. They also have $3 beers on Saturday (and various other drink deals every other day of the week). Serving sizes are a bit larger than a single meal, I barely finished. The food wasn't amazing, but I guess it's good bar food without going gourmet.   Overall, bring friends and an appetite. The crowd here is mixed--bachelorette party,  people off work, loud rambunctious folks, and more. It's an interesting place to be and a nice place to kick back.",

The late night menu was limited, but that didn't stop us. We ordered and crushed nachos, wings, chicken strips, and some other nondescript bar food.  The waitress kept our glasses full and did her best to bring out the food quickly, even if it took a heckuva long time after we ordered.  But i'm not complaining.

Various appetizers were passed around the tables and everyone seemed to enjoy them (I don't like fried pickles).  Ordered the six-piece of Weesie's Wings in bbq and buffalo sauce.  The wings were not drenched in sauce, which is good; making it easier to use my patent one-hand wing eating style on them.  Overall, they were good though a tad on the high end for just six wings.  But what really brought the house down for my friends were the County Fair Funnel Straws, which were amazingly good... never had funnel cake in straw form.  Overall, I give it three stars.  The wait time was a bit longer than expected, the service was a little slow in the refill area, and the TVs were not calibrated making them VERY BRIGHT in a dimly light area.  The food was good, but not amazing (except the funnel straws).",

Being from California, I know that gluten-free menus are very easy to come by in the Golden State, but in the southeast, gluten-free still gets blank stares at many spots. Mortimer's was a good example of that. The host looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when I asked about a gluten-free menu. No matter, I would figure something out.   The server was a little better (and actually, very friendly). She at least knew what gluten free was and knew to check with the cook about certain items (the fries and nachos, for example, are not gluten-free).   A wine list? I didn't expect one, but she gladly brought one over after twenty minutes of looking for it. It had two house wines and five other wines. None of them were good. But that was to be expected.  The real problems came when dealing with my sandwich, which I figured could be made without bread to accommodate the gluten-free. It never came. The rest of the party ordered, got their appetizers, their dinners, their drinks - finished everything, and mine still hadn't arrived.  I inquired and apparently (surprise) it was never made. They made it in about ten minutes and it was okay bar food with roast beef and melted cheese directly on the plate since there was no bread. (Most places that do gluten-free modifications for sandwiches put the meat, etc. on lettuce just to make it more visually appealing if nothing else.)  I debated on two or three stars for this review. The rest of my party wasn't that impressed with their food, so I went with the lower rating of two stars, even though the server had a very friendly smile and seemed somewhat apologetic over the lack of their ability to accommodate my dining needs.   Being a bar, it's probably not in their best interest to develop a full gluten-free menu. That's not their real clientele. However, with the Convention Center so close and lots of  hotels around with guests, it might make sense for them to at least educate the staff on what gluten is so that they can easily modify existing menu items to fit those needs.  UPDATE: I've heard from the manager at Mortimer's and I was impressed with her response. She's indicated that the employees have been given more information on special diet needs just so that they're able to be accurate with guests. I appreciate the extra training for them and also that she took the time to respond to my review in such a professional manner. I'd be glad to try them again if I'm in Charlotte.",

They partnered with Boars Head meats and cheeses so the quality of the sandwich was good.  Their fries are good (skinny fries) and came out hot.

After reading his reviews of other restaurants in the area, I find that most of them are based more off of his judgement of people and not the restaurant itself.  I'm glad I gave this little pub tucked away in the Epicentre a chance regardless of his negative review.  In my opinion, the atmosphere was just perfect.  I loved how the waitstaff spent time with customers, including myself.  I heard employees calling several customers by name when they came in, which made this pub in the big ol' Epicentre feel even more inviting.  The food was amazing!  I ordered the Big Diaw with macaroni salad and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who goes here.  The best version of the French dip I've ever had!  Overall, this was definitely a great pick for a night out (even on the week night that I went) and I will absolutely be back in the very near future!",

They are usually the only bar that will show ALL ECU games.  After living in Charlotte for years and going to Mortimer's all the time, I am sad to say I will never return.  Last night, myself and 3 girlfriends were sitting at the bar.  It was ECU's 2nd game vs. Florida Atlantic.  The bar was not as crowded as I expected, and I was glad we got bar seats.  Emily was our bartender, we have had her before and she is great.  We were drinking the half off wine and watching in our purple and gold.  During a commercial, these 2 gentlemen (in a very joking manner) were complaining about how ECU game was on over the NFL game (at least the sound)  The male bartender (or maybe barback) was sort of hounding them on saying \"Yeah I know, it sucks but it's an ECU bar.  The owner's went to ECU\"  in a very obvious joking manner, I smiled at all of them and looked at the male bartender and said \"Hey you cant say that, this is an ECU bar\"  He turned to me with a very ugly attitude and face saying \"Actually I'm pretty sure I can and just did\"    My girlfriends, myself and even the 2 gentlemen all looked a bit amazed that he had made such a snark comment to me.  The bartender then walked away.  Again, we frequent this bar, know the specials, know some of the workers, and I know that they all know how to have a good time and be personable.  I will never return there knowing that asshole works behind the bar, and I most certainly wont bring my girlfriends to watch the game there .  I have worked as a bartender for years and I am now in the hospitality industry, and I would never speak to a customer that way.    After his asshole comment, we got our tabs, thanked Emily, and walked over to Blackfinn.  The 2 gentlemen joined us, because as I was leaving I asked them to and also let them know the NFL game would be in sound there.  this is the only review I have ever written about a bar in Charlotte.  I am that upset, offended and disappointed. Looks like we will be finding a new bar to watch our games, or just have to make more trips to Greenville.",

I got the Mac and cheese bites and he got the chicken parm sliders and we shared a side of Fries. Easily some of the best appetizers we've had, full of flavor and served fresh and hot. The drinks on the other hand were just OK, which is why I deduct a star. Mine was so sweet I couldn't finish it because it started to hurt my stomach so bad (it was just a tequila sunrise). Bf got one of their whiskey speciality drinks which he said was okay but nothing special. Food was spectacular though. Highly recommended !!",

Overall okay food but nothing great. If I come back it would be for drinks at the bar.",

I ordered the Hawaiian Chicken panini because I'll eat anything with pineapple on it (well, almost anything).  The panini was good but nothing to write home about. Then again, the whole idea of writing home is pretty antiquated...but I digress. Anyway, the pineapple was ample and the cheese was generous as well. However, there could've been a little more meat.  The panini comes with one side and I ordered the mac salad. It was pretty small and very underwhelming. Small as it was, I didn't even bother finishing it.  I would give the panini four stars and the mac salad only two, for an average of three. Seems like a better spot for lunch than dinner.",

I had the Big Diaw (Roast Beef and Swiss Panini) with kettle chips. I enjoyed the sandwich, Cajun mayonnaise had a bit more spice than expected. Kettle chips tasted as if they came from a bag rather than freshly prepared as expected.  Other members of my party had the Philly Cheesesteak also with kettle chips (they made the same comment) and Nachos. The nachos were larger than expected.

The wine was fine for $4 and the bacon cheese fries were generously coated with cheese and bacon. While there was a lot of the topping, it was on top of a pile of fries, and I think they could make it even better by layering the bacon and cheese throughout the fries. The fries were smaller, like McDonald's, and served fresh. Service was good and the bar tenders were attentive. A nice post work crowd to chat it up with as well. There were signs that indicated there was live music some nights, but given the layout of the space, I can't imaging where someone set up to play. I guess if I go back at night, I'll find out.   The downside here is parking because you have to park at the Epicenter, which was $10 this day and often greater. I called to see if they validate parking because it would have been worth returning to the restaurant, but after several calls and a busy signal, it appeared that the number did not work.",

This little visit was on Saturday from around 2-4. We sat outside and enjoyed people watching and chatting.  We decided to order a couple of beers and some tasty appetizers. We were totally bad and ordered fries, fried mac & cheese, parmesan encrusted mozzarella cheese sticks, and chicken parm sliders. Yikes... not the best food choices! And on top of that, there was a ton of food! Everything was good... but I would have to say chicken parm sliders & fried mac & cheese bites were my favorites.  Since we were outdoors, our service was a bit slow, but not terrible. All in all we had a good time and enjoyed the food & bevvies. We will definitely be back!",

This is just a dirty and dingy bar with people who are wayyyyyyy over-served.  what makes me write this review is my most recent visit:  My wife and I stopped in for a quick drink and some food before our movie started next door.  When we arrived and sat down at the bar, there were SEVERAL (about 7 people) who were all so hammered that you could not understand what they were saying.  I do know that they all worked at the Tin Roof in the epicenter, and all of them said they had not been to sleep yet from the night before (this was on New Years day)....  the bartenders kept serving them shot after shot after shot after shot.  It was a very uncomfortable experience.   ALSO, do NOT order the nachos.... that was the biggest waste of $13 I have ever spent.... AWFUL.  just do yourself a favor and avoid this place.",

A few favorites include the Tricky Chicky Parm, the Stack Attack Club, the Presto Chicken Pesto, and the Pizza Panini Grill. I'm also a big fan that Mortimer's offers a side salad option without an upcharge- I feel like that's pretty rare at most restaurants nowadays.   The last time my husband and I came here was prior to seeing a musical uptown and it was exactly what we needed -- quick service, full meal, bar access, and we happened to come in while there was a live band playing.

Sunday night, this was the only place that wasn't crowded so we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar.  The place was really small so I can see how this place could get crowded but there was nothing going on as the other reviewers have posted such as live music or other entertainment. There was the one drunk feller and his buddy next to us who were REALLY loud so I guess that could pass for entertainment.  I thought because of the layout that this was supposed to be an Irish bar. It might not be, just an assumption on my part. I was hoping to get a Guinness or a Smithwick but unless I missed it, they pretty much carried the local brews and a couple of macros on tap.   The major problem I had with this place was the lighting. So dark sitting at the bar, I had to use my phone to see the menu. I wonder, if it was this dark at the bar, it must've really been dark at the tables. We ordered some fried pickles and I had a club sandwich. I've had better pickles but the club was decent.  The bartender was cool as most are and a decent enough place to visit but I probably won't be back. More of a college crowd and business traveler type patrons.",

I was looking forward to getting a reuben at Mortimer's as I continued my journey around Charlotte to try them all, but I was very severely disappointed by what was put on the plate in front of me. The menu boasted flash fried corned beef (sounded delicious), but the corned beef on the sandwich lacked any flavor and the person I was with thought it was mushy. The bread was the worst part of the sandwich - it tasted bad. Like maybe it was moldy and had been sitting around for too long kind of bad. It left this awful flavor in your mouth that really ruins your dinner experience. The rest of the ingredients on the reuben were average with decent (probably just normal store-bought) kraut and OK swiss. The proportions were fine, but that doesn't help much when the ingredients aren't very good to start.  This is one of the worst reubens I've tried in Charlotte and I'd highly recommend avoiding it. I've had a couple other things on their menu and their far and away better, so if you stop in for food make sure to pick something else on the menu.",

We were looking for a place to sit outside and enjoy the weather but every place was full. The last place we tried was here and we decided to go inside and wait for an outside table.  We were served by Aaron from Lenoir, an Air Force Veteran who has worked there for several years. A friendly fellow though he admitted his allegiance to the Redskins.  He noticed my hat and being Memorial Weekend, invited me to sign their Veteran wall.  We decided to forget about the outside table and talked Panther and Redskin football with Aaron instead.",

I'm a business traveler, so, does downtown Charlotte fear the power of people with metal butter knives? Or is it policy to do everything within their power to put more plastic into the environment?  It was a perfectly fine pub experience until I got the silverware, and then it felt like I was on an airplane.  It sets a tone...that's all I'm saying.  Otherwise, food & service were fine.  Neither outstanding nor abysmal...what you expect from a pub.",

This place feels like home and the staff wants to make you feel like part of the family. If you're in uptown, do yourself a favor and check out Mortimer's. They've got amazing paninis and salads- perfect for a quick lunch break or a casual (delicious) dinner. Writing about it makes me crave a Big Diaw or Betsy's Buffalo Chicken panini!",

Funny that Tim G said it was too small because I was surprised at how big the inside was. But I guess lunch time and nightlife wise you're looking at things from a different perspective.  I loved the selection of items they offer(a few items smothered in brown gravy, will have to investigate further into how that tastes) and I had a hard time selecting a sandwich since they all looked like interesting combinations of flavors. I went with the WWIII which was out of this world. My friend got the nachos, normally, I never have a negative thing to say about nachos (since it's kinda difficult to mess them up) but these were less than stellar. The chips had a funky taste to them and covered in Velveeta like cheese sauce. I love Velveeta as much as the next person  but it was more along the lines of not fully melted and hard (yet not lumpy), ick. Very rarely do I have nachos that don't meet my low standards on the nacho scale but these were at the bottom of the totem pole in my book. Prices are reasonable and service was attentive and quick but for some reason, I'm sitting on three stars for now as opposed to four.  They have cutesie names for a number of items, they are a pub and have some Rat Pack memorabilia on the walls so I am still scratching my head with what their theme is? . However, the randomness that is Mortimer's could bring me back. A solid spot for lunch, I would definitely check this place out again for lunch in a pinch.",

    "text": "Lunchity lunch lunch in Uptown...Mortimer's most certainly fits the bill for a super tasty lunch. So, that being said, this review focuses on Mortimer's as a day time eating and drinking establishment, not a late night stop (although I'm sure that would be delightful, too - I just haven't experience it as of yet). So, yes, 4+ stars for a low key and affordable lunch in Uptown. Here's why...  I've been in a few times, but recently Mortimer's changed their menu and now offers a variety of sandwiches, paninis, salads, starters and sides. Prices are right on the money - expect to pay $7-$10 for a sammie plus a side. It's important to note that many of the items here are made in house, like their tasty, light and flavorful chicken salad. No heavy doses of mayo mixed in with that bird salad. Hooray! Oh and I must mention the service. Every single server has been on the money here - friendly, chatty and helpful.   I've tried the Big Easy wrap which is slammin' with a kick. But, my favorite thus far was had yesterday when I bellied up at the bar for a panini - I chose Jess' Sausalito Turkey. De-freakin'-licious. Picture manageable ciabatta with melty cheese, thin slices of spiced turkey, paper thin shards of green pepper and red onion with some delectable sauce. It was seriously good. Side wise, I've only had fruit...even thought I've coveted the macaroni salad. Next time, Mortimer's, next time indeed.",

I arrived with every intention to get the Beef on Weck, but after some deliberation and no small amount of waffling between all of the delicious-looking sandwiches, I went with the Coach Magazu BBQ Chick (it's almost impossible for me to resist a sandwich with \"bacon\" and \"BBQ\" in the description).   I took it to go, which was pretty quick...no complaints about the service from a carry-out perspective. The hostess and waitress were very friendly while I waited, and soon enough I was back home, taking my first bite...and my expectations were exceeded! Yes, it sounded delicious...but I think we all know that you can't necessary judge food by it's description. This, however, was delicious in every particular...the chicken, sliced deli-style, the cheese, the BBQ-sauce....so. good. yum.   All in all, the couple experiences I've had with Mortimers (all carry-out) have been great...and who knows, maybe someday I'll even get around to trying the sandwich that prompted my trek to Mortimer's in the first place!",

I wanted  to try a place that I wouldn't be able to eat at in Chapel Hill, so we both decided that Mortimer's looked like it might be a neat place. My friend had never eaten there either, so we were both looking forward to trying something new. Our waitress was pretty nice (nothing spectacular, but not bad) and we received pretty good service. I ordered Hannah's Wrap (I think that is what it was called), which was okay, but I don't think I would order it again. Very standard, some fruit, turkey and lettuce. They do have a very extensive menu if you are looking for a sandwich, but I noticed  that most of their wraps were the exact same as their salads, just wrapped up in a tortilla and given a different name. I always appreciate restaurants with creative menus, and I felt less than wow-ed by their wrap and salad selection.   My friend ordered a veggie wrap and specifically asked for no pepper jack cheese (or cheese whatsoever). When her wrap came out, it, of course, had pepper-jack cheese on it. I would have sent the wrap back, but my friend is a lot lower maintenance than I am. However, I was a little surprised when the waitress stopped by our table to refill our drinks, noticed my friend picking off the cheese, and didn't say anything...like \"oh no they put cheese on it!\" or even \"is your food okay?\" Maybe she wasn't very observant, but my friend plopping slices of cheese on her plate, I feel like, is a pretty obvious thing.   I did really like the atmosphere of the place (if you're there, look up. The ceiling is awesome!). There are lots of pictures, cool quotes, and just an overall \"pub\" feel about the place that made me feel like I was truly in a restaurant unlike any other restaurant I've been in before. I liked that. Maybe I would have liked the place better if I was there for dinner/drinks instead...however, the last thing on my mind at 12 pm on Saturday after a night out was ordering a mixed drink.   I liked Mortimer's okay, but I don't think I would go back there to eat again. Just not very impressed with the food.",

The sandwich I had was awesome and they even had a special for 25% off when you show them a Northern ID and they accepted my Passport that said I was born in New York.  Definitely a place to check out.",

I had a beer and the Pete Rose in Cancun panini.  Mortimer's knows how to make a good panini. The panini was an awesome combo of steak sandwich, nacho cheese, jalapeno, and au jus sauce.  The taste blended together so well that after this review im probably going to get another one.  The costs was $9 which isn't that bad.  Our server was great and its a great place to stop at if you are near epicenter.",

From that, I could tell this place was going to be an all around good time.   We went inside, and would have to wait 30 mins for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar. My boyfriend was happy because sports were on, but I was happy to order my drink.  I ordered the pink lemonade martini, and it was SO good!! It came in this jar, which made me want to send it back, but after tasting it, I was happy I didnt. Looks have nothing to do with it, and this drink def had me in a great mood!  My boyfriend had a corona, and a beer is a beer to me. We then ordered wings and fries. Bbq for me, and honey-hot wings for the gentleman. My wings were very tasty, and my boyfriend liked his as well.  We then proceeded to wind down a little more by taking a shot of Grey Goose. Man did the bartender give us a huge shot! Thumbs up for her!  The whole place seemed to be filled with workers from uptown who just wanted to grab a few drinks, and some food before the weekend started.  I def recommend this to anyone looking for good food, fast service, nice drinks, and a great atmosphere to loosen up after work.",

I would definitely suggest getting them. When we left around 5 the place was beginning to fill up with an after-work crowd. I would definitely go back to try more things on their menu.",

    "text": "Oh, Sunday nights in Charlotte - when the streets are rolled up by 9pm promptly.  What is one to do if the confines of the house become too much?  I thought for sure the Epicenter would still be alive - especially given that it was Halloween weekend.  I was much mistaken: the only figment of Halloween to be found was the eerie zombie-movie-like desolation, few people out and even the wind blowing a newspaper across the ground while the background music still blared.  But tucked in a corner on the first floor was Mortimer's, an oasis in that barren Sunday desert.  I was very surprised by the small, cozy interior that was everything you would expect a good bar to be: dark wood tables and counters, plenty of things on the walls and TVs showing the Panthers losing.  I didn't order any food, but the bar service was quick and attentive, and the prices were reasonable too.  The bartenders know what they are doing (a rarity in Charlotte).  There are plenty of spirits to mix your heart out and I was happy to see they have Olde Meck on tap.  It was a casual, fun atmosphere.  Mind you, I'm not one to go out of my way to do anything at the Epicenter, but I'll certainly be inclined to steal away into Mortimer's again next time I'm Uptown.",

    "text": "The draft beer was cold and reasonably priced.  The food, however, was completely unappetizing.  We started off with the tortilla chips with 3 dipping sauces. What were we thinking!  The chips were stale and the 3 dipping sauces covered the range from bad, to worse, to worst. According to the menu, the Tassy's Beef on Weck sandwich comes recommended by Grover Cleveland; it may very well have been the last thing he ate.  The Hall of Fame Philly sandwich had all of the ingredients of Philly cheese steak but somehow tasted nothing like one.  It was more like a warm slice of salt block on a bun.  Other than that, the ambience was ideal, if you like music and sports blaring at the same time.  Fortunately, there was a CVS nearby, so we were able buy and toss down a pack of Nutter Butter cookies to quickly kill the aftertaste.  While I feel sorry for the workers at Mortimer's, the establishment would do everyone a big favor by closing its doors.",

My bar mate asked for a beer, and I wasn't sure so I stated, \"Um...\" and she quipped, \"Sorry, we're all out of that\".  Of course I smiled, because clearly we had a bartender who knew what she was doing.  I finally ordered a drink.  What else more can I say?  Sammi was a great bartender, had a lot of personality, and made sure every one at the bar was engaged in conversation and having a good time. There was a pretty rad cover band playing that night too, so all in all it was a great night!!",

Make her THINK about what she said (my mom would add, \"you cannot take things back that you say.  it's like trying to put toothpaste back in a tube\").  But my buddy, Travi the Rabbi, and I venture down to the Epicenter to visit Mortimer's every now and again for lunch.  As it IS the Epicenter, the help is usually clad in tight bar logo'ed tank tops and jean shorts which is a nice break from corporate casual.  Although, last time, two out of the three waitresses were preggers, giving them three huge tank top protrusions instead of two.  Something in the water?  It is usually crowded there for lunch and a few times we have been banished to the two tops attached to the wall on the opposite side of the bar.  The artwork isn't bad with the smatterings of drunken WC Fields quotes on the walls (my favorite WC Fields quote isn't represented though: \"a woman drove me to drink and i never had the chance to thank her\").  The food.  Carter's Honey Turkey with bacon isn't too bad.  The standard center loaded deli sandwich with some good flavor.  Jeremiah's Bell Tower leaves me in search of solid chicken salad, but it is an okay sandwich.  Nothing amazing flavor-wise.  The Chicken Nacho Wrap is just weird.  Call it a burrito with tortilla chips smashed inside and be done with it.  And its messy (Dry-clean only means this shirt is dirty - Mitch Hedberg.  This pertains to a lot of my work shirts and I don't want to run the risk of a stain).  The Big Easy is a pretty solid wrap with good flavors.  The sides leave a little to be desired with heavy mayo based pasta salad, potato salad, or fruit salad that all come in little jello shot cups.  So get the chips.  To sum it up, the menu has enough options to keep me coming back on the periodic basis that I do and the service doesn't irritate me.  Now, if you catch me there AFTER work, smack me and send me to the corner with the cat....",

She described it as \"good, not great.\"  But these facts alone do not earn this restaurants two stars.  Mortimer's gets this rating because they served dinner, on a Friday night, with plastic silverware.  No points awarded for how amazingly close an approximation to real, shiny silverware these plastic forks and knives provided.
