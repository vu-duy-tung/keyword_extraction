We had never been and wanted to check it out, as it's in a great location w/ a small park beside it with different games to try.  The greeter was nice and let us know we could seat ourselves, inside or wait for a table outside.  We took a look around, inside, and were impressed w/ how the bowling alley and bar was set up.  When we were seated outside, it took a while for our server to get to us and the area around us needed sweeping.  Once we got our order in, the food arrived quickly; however, some of the order was incorrect and the food was okay.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, especially in the BBQ dishes.  I think overall this establishment is a nice hang out, but not so much for a sit down meal.",

I knew he would love the Foosball, ping pong, and shuffleboard, but most importantly he would love the Mortal Kombat 2 on the og arcade upstairs.   When we went the change machine wasn't working, and as an FYI the arcade games are $.50. We went downstairs to get some change and to grab a drink and something to eat since I couldn't stop talking about how good the chicken and waffles are and how he should try the chicken and waffles.  Something else to keep in mind is that the bar closest to the front door has a full menu, while the bar in the back does not. The bartender said that is what they are doing for the first month they are open, so it shouldn't be too much longer.   I got the OMB Hornet's Nest for $4 on draft and the chicken and waffles appetizer for $7. They have it as a meal, but it comes with 2 sides, and just seemed like a lot of food, and I don't think waffles reheat.... Anyways my husband ordered a lager (can't remember which) his was $5, and a burger (because of course he didn't get the chicken and waffles) which was $10/$11 I think.  My food came out first and was delicious. I subbed the moonshine apple butter for the maple honey mustard and was very glad I did. The waffle was perfect and so was the chicken. I definitely ate all of it, and again was glad I only got the appetizer. My husband said his burger was also really good and that he was surprised at how good my chicken and waffles were (although I said they were). We ended up getting quarters and going up to battle each other in Mortal Kombat, where I ended up losing 2-1. We then played Ninja Turtles and were promptly out of quarters, so we had to say goodbye and until we meet again.   By the way ping pong is free.",

We went for the first time last night, simply to grab a dinner, drinks, and check it out.  I have to say, it's impressive! Much on the lines of Park Lanes off Montford, but Piedmont Social House offers even more. Aside from the food and drinks being creative and good(there is a whole menu of boiler makers), the large bowling alley, there are also several areas with pool tables, shuffle board, and old school video games. The clientale is decent too. No crazy drunks or riff raff which makes it family friendly in my opinion. I can see us planning a group outing with several couples and/or kids to take advantage of this great new venue right in our backyard!",

At the lane we waited for 10 minutes for a server before finally asking a girl if she could wait on us. She said we weren't here lane, but she ended up waiting on us. Needless to say, service was SLOW!   About halfway into our bowling somebody puked over the balcony onto our lane. It was 20 minutes before anybody came to clean it. They proceeded to clean the puke with a rag and a bottle of spray cleaner, even though we told them it was vomit. The manager said she thought it was just a spilled drink, even though several people saw this happen. The manager only offered to add 30 minutes to our bowling, but after the horrible cleaning job we declined. She then said she would email us coupons for free games......we never received them.   It seemed like a nice place but they really need to get their act together and work on customer service before we consider going back, especially since they were pricey!",

When you walk in you immediately see the bowling area. I believe there are about 6 or so lanes to bowl on. After you pass the bowling area you can either head up stairs and hang out or go straight a head toward the bar area. I guess since my company rented this place out they were a little over whelmed and it took me a while to get a drink. But we rented the whole establishment and toward the ends of the night, my coworkers also had a hard time placing their drink orders, even when no one else was barely at the bar. A couple of bartenders passed by my coworkers while they were trying to get their attention. They also had a DJ, and  towards the end of the night every time he cut a song on after five seconds or so, he would shut it off and talk and then move to the next song-- which was annoying. For the Charlotte area, I would have to say this place could be a pretty cool chill spot. I did not get to try the food, but the rum punch was pretty good.",

I was surprised to find the size of this place: 8 bowling lanes, pool table, arcade games, dart, shaffle board (coin operated) & plenty of room to roam around.   Honestly I like to have loved this place more, but my two main disappointments are: 1) $12+ tax for a cocktail and it was TINY in my opinion - I swear I can get cheaper & better drinks in NYC at this rate 2) half of the beer on tap printed on the menu was out - guess what, use a chalkboard instead. Nothing kills a beer buzz like playing a game of \"do you have this then?\"  The food overall was good - the glazed carrots could be cooked longer (it should be soft, not crunchy). The chicken fingers were solid (and appeared fresh, not frozen).   This is a solid 3.5 star place",

The place reminds me of a mix between Strike City, Duckworths, and VBGB. There are several areas with pool tables, ping pong, and several bowling lanes, and conversation areas.   There is a full menu which we got to sample, the best dish being the chicken and waffle with maple butter. The inside bar area had several large tables and high tops and there was also a large area upstairs with conversation areas as well as  flat screens, additional pool and ping pong tabes.  We also got to sample a drink, called the ice pick, which was probably the only negative thing I can say about the place cuz it was very watered down and weak. :-( and when I say something is weak it's pretty bad cuz I am a lightweight.  hopefully this is not the quality of drink served in a normal setting or their bartender may need to be a little less stingy with the good stuff.  There was a good mix of people which I love and sometimes find it rare to have such a diverse crowd of people in social settings in Charlotte. This place is welcoming to all with pretty good food and a place to converse and have a good time.  Did I mention they have a cool outdoor bar space with  pretty ample seating and cornhole.. I will definitely be back soon. It's a unique venue for Charlotte and glad to see place like this open for something a little different.",

    "text": "This is what you get when you cross a bowling alley, pool tables with good food, great beer, a game room and an accommodating staff - a great place to enjoy an afternoon or evening with friends, coworkers or just random new people.  The place sits in the Ayrlsey complex in southwest Charlotte next to the Indian restaurant and across the parking lot from Portofinos. They have plenty of seating if you want to enjoy a meal and 3 bars, 2 inside and one on the patio,  There are 2 sets of 6 bowling lanes, pool tables in the back and a game room upstairs.  There is comfortable seating throughout if you want to just relax and chill.    The food menu is broad and very diverse with salads, burgers, wraps and southern specialities like shrimp and grits and fried catfish.  The staff was amazing when I was there but it was their grand opening too.  But a couple of flaws that made this short of a 5 star review.  First, in the mens bowling shoe selection, another group took all the size 12s and our group was forced to go smaller to 11 1/2 or much larger to 15s and 16s. Seems like they only have 2 of each size shoe.  Second, the casual play bowling scoresheet software does not allow you to add a new player to your game. They had to change your game to a league game.  And third, the beer prices are a bit pricey here. $6 to $8 for local craft beer that you can get elsewhere for $4-6.  Another bad thing is that parking can be a bear here. But I blame that on Ayrsley, not this business.  Still, I liked this place and I work close to it so I can see myself coming back here once in a while.",

    "text": "You want to come here for the fun, not the food. PSH has a diverse after work crowd during the week and an Ayrsley party crowd on the weekends.  Food - Visited w/ a yelp event and none of the food was impressionable. Most said the chicken and waffles were the best. Unfortunately, I never got to taste them. The chicken tenders were tasty. On my 2nd visit, friends ordered chicken tenders, which were COLD, but they didn't want the hassle of sending it back. One friend had a side of green beans and while fresh and flavorful, she felt they were undercooked. Another friend had Mac & cheese and really liked it, stating that she usually doesn't like m&c in restaurants, but she liked PSH's. I had the white chocolate cheesecake, which was good. I was impressed with the presentation. Entrees are priced reasonably at $12-16.  Venue - The venue is large, with 12 lanes of bowling (6 in 2 locations), two floors, several pool tables, and various arcade and ping pong tables throughout. Tried to play ping pong, but found it to be a scavenger hunt after one waitress said that there were two downstairs in addition to the ones upstairs that were occupied. She simply didn't know what she was talking about, which we realized after searching high and low, even finding ping pong tables in storage behind the building, and security finally explaining she was wrong.   Drinks - Mixed drinks were extremely weak for average price of $10. I HIGHLY suggest you drink beer or wine.  Service -One floater asked me if there was anything our table needed. I told her I wanted to order some cheesecake. Her response \"Oh, I can't do that. You'll have to tell your waitress.\" It seemed like she was asking to be polite, but was in fact useless. While she may not have been able to input the order, the proper thing to do would be to simply tell my waitress. Nevertheless, OUR waitress was on top of things, despite having several tables to take care of. Can't remember her name. Thicker black lady w/hair pulled up and red lipstick. She was on top of things and obviously experienced and a hard worker. They do work as a team here and several people interacted w/our table getting random things.... Napkins, silverware, straws, etc.. So with time, I'm sure things will get better.  While you're always going to have kinks with a new restaurant, management needs to force its staff to at the very LEAST familiarize itself with the lay of the land and the menu.  That being said, it isn't Piedmont Social Restaurant, it's house and you don't come here for the food...  (At least you shouldn't. While the menu is more extensive than a normal bar, don't be fooled. It's bar food.) You come to socialize. Expect an environment where you can have some laughs, play some games, and have a good time socializing.",

    "text": "This is a cool spot to check out. Me and the boyfriend came here due to a Groupon- bowling for 2, bowling shoes, appetizer, and 2 nonalcoholic drinks.   Staff was very friendly and polite. If you do go bowling, you have to trade your shoes in to get bowling shoes. The bowling lanes are average and there were plenty of bowling balls to choose from.   The 2 nonalcoholic drinks that the Groupon mentions are soft drinks. I was hoping that they would have some sort of speciality lemonades or sparklers. We also ordered beers that were on special for $3.50 (Tuesdays) which wasn't bad at all. For the appetizer, we got the pork nachos. I thought they were just okay while the boyfriend loved them. They were freaking huge and could easily feed 4 people.   The only downfalls was that there were a good amount of gnats/flies near the bar area where our food and drinks were being held. Also the bowling lanes are closer together than other alleys which was uncomfortable because 2 other groups came shortly after us and we were sandwiched in although there were other lanes open.   Overall, I'm glad that I visited. There are equivalent options if not better options that are closer to me so I won't be visiting again due to location but I'm glad I came.",

I ordered a cup of soup and they bought me a giant bowl of the saltiest soup next to condensed Campbell's chicken and noodle soup.

The sweet potato fries were good, but they had a little too much sugar on them for my liking.  It was more like a dessert.  The burger was good except it was really undercooked on one side. I was not asked how I would like it to be cooked so maybe that's why.  I'm not sure if I would return, if so it would be because of the atmosphere.

I had it with mac and cheese and carrots. He ordered it with mac and cheese and asparagus. The food came out very fast. I\"m not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. The portion was a good size, but the chicken was totally underwhelming. The menu describes the chicken as being \"double dipped\". I'm not sure if that was the problem, but the chicken has a ridiculous amount of breading that did not adhere to the chicken and was just flaking off. The temperature of the food was warm but not hot. We were there for lunch around 1pm and it seemed like maybe the restaurant had cooked a bunch of chicken earlier for a lunch rush and we were getting what was left over - the chicken was definitely not 'fresh out of the fryer'. The mac and cheese was okay, very creamy if you like that style.   I can't speak to the games as we didn't play any. If you are going there for the games, then you will probably have a great time.If you are going for the food, I would not recommend it.",

Ping-pong, pool, bowling, and board games. This is a great venue for people who want to do more than just sit and drink. Perfect for watching any sports. Lots of TVs. The food came out very quick and was good. Not overly impressed with the outside bartender. My first beer she added a $1 to the total price, which I did not realize until I saw the drink menu and the prices later on. I guess she figured she would just include her tip herself. My food tab was $15.70;  I gave her a twenty and she rounded up and only gave me $4. back. It may have only been .30 cents, but that was not her decision to make on keeping my money. As a former server, I always overtip. However, I also really resent the servers who ruin it for the good ones! Unacceptable staff can ruin an establishment and its reputation. I hope that is not the case with Piedmont Social House because it is a really cool place to hang out!  Check it out with friends. You will have fun!",

We first went during opening weekend, all the employees were rude and acted as though we were putting them out, not to mention they didn't know how to work their equipment or have change for our tab! We decided to try again hoping that they had worked out the bugs, turns out the employees were just as rude if not worse! Save yourself and go to 10 Park Lanes instead for better service, drinks, food and bowling. This is a complete waste of time and money!",

In fact, it was such a great visit, that I started telling my friends and coworkers about it. Visit two was during lunch a week later: The food was still good, but it was missing the special sauces (we had ordered them on the side) for at least 3 orders in our party. Also, service was rather slow and we did go over our usual one hour lunch time. I was a little disappointed then. Visit three was this week for dinner with a group of out-of-town coworkers. It took 15 minutes for us to get noticed in the bar area; it was completely understaffed, yet there were people with PSH shirts everywhere! The waiter was very friendly when he was finally able to take our drink orders, but it probably took a good 20 minutes for drinks to arrive and our water took another 15. We ordered dinner then. The food was delicious, but the whole dinner took 2 hours! To be honest, I felt embarrassed for recommending PSH to my coworkers!",

We were told sorry and they tried to offer us a free bowling pass when we came back. Needless to say, I told the manager we wouldn't be back.

    "text": "I went to Piedmont Social House tonight with a party of 10.  Girls night for dinner and drinks.  Sat on the patio.  So far so good.  Ordered an appletini with Tito's vodka.  When it came, it was incredibly watered down.  I have not once in my almost 50 years complained that an appletini was too watered down.  I usually need more sour.  Seriously, I could taste water in it.  I didn't want to make a scene in front of the whole table, so I didn't complain.  Figured I had just blown $6-7 bucks.  When the bill came, it was $11.00!!!!  I then decided there was no way I could pay that much for that terrible drink, so I shared my concern with my waitress and she had a manager come to the table.  I told him I didn't mind paying some because I drank it, but it was watered down.  He basically told me that was not possible because of the way they pour their drinks.  He said he would take some off for me.  I got my corrected check and he took off a whopping $1.65.  I paid $9.35 for water basically.  Needless to say I won't return.  There are plenty of other options in Ayrsley.  Doesn't seem smart to me to nickel and dime customers instead of making them feel valued and heard.  The amount they lose now on my many future visits would have greatly offset even the $4-5 he could have taken off the drink.  Oh and I still had paid for about $20 in my food not to mention the other 9 at my table, so it wasn't like I (we) didn't contribute something to their bottom line in sales for the night and throw in that was 9 more people that witnessed my bad experience and walked away with the wrong impression.

When asking waiter...he went to check, came back & said \"oh the sides you chose had an up charge\" then we asked to see the menu again since we couldn't believe we didn't notice that. But when he brought the menu, he said \"I'm sorry it's not printed here, but IT IS an up charge\" we then asked for the manager & instead the waiter came back, threw the corrected check on the table & walked away.  It wasn't about the few dollars, but more about honest business practice. You can't simply add $3 to someone's tab without any explanation or choice up front. Also btw, this happened to 3 people at our table of 8. Hmmmmm",

Sadly both of those were missing and had to be requested. The sweet potato fries were good, that is the ones that were actually cooked. It is still new so some kinks but its gotta get better.

Then my friend did not like the honey carrots (btw, they are horrible. Save your taste buds and get the sweet potato fries!) And we asked 2 different serves for our waiter and he never showed up.

    "text": "I am giving PSH a poor review because of the food. The first time I went to PSH it was so crowded we went across the street and ate at Portofinos which is always amazing. Tonight however when I invited eight of my friends to go to PSH and have dinner and games our experience was horrible. When we got there we were set right away as there were plenty of open tables. We ordered drinks which were great. Then we ordered food and we waited at least 40 minutes for the food to come out. The waiter came out before the food came out saying they were slammed and our food would be put in a bit. Ok they'd fine. The problem was when the food came out I took one look at it and it was all dried up and I took a bite and it was cold like room temperature it looked and tasted like it had been sitting I the back for 30 minutes. Our entire table had to send our orders back because they were cold. Mind I'm not the type of person to do this typically if the foods a little cold I'll suffer through but this was beyond acceptable. Then when they finally brought our orders back out by burger was burnt to a crisp it was dry and crumbly and tasted like grocery store frozen burger. I think it may have been the worst burger I've ever eaten and that's saying a lot because I'm not picky. I only ate  a portion of my food and my other friend who also got a burger said the same thing and barley touched her food. One of my friends who got the loaded fries was without ranch which was supposed to cone with the fries and which he asked for multiple times. He was done with his meal practically by the time they brought it out. We all thought they with how horrible or experience was that they would offer a discount or something but nothing was offered.   As far as the bowling, bar and ambience it's great but the food is a no go. I will not be eating there again. Also they should invest in some more games they tend to all be being used leaving a lot of people standing around waiting for other groups to finish.",

I thought the chicken tender was really soft, and their food were above average in general. The atmosphere was ambient and a great hangout for groups/team building and friends.   Slight complain though is that there aren't enough seating/tables by the bowling alley so if you are trying to eat while bowling, you might have to stand and eat. Really wish they have more tables.",

Groupon had a sweet deal that included Bowling and shoes for four (one game - weekend costs a little extra), 2 Appetizers and 4 nonalcoholic drinks.  Let me say, this place looks totally different in the day! Lots of light and a crazy amount of space!  The lanes here are new, well-oiled and well maintained. The computer system has all sorts of additional features, including bumpers that go up and down for kids.  The bar(s) have a sweet selection of Draught Beers including 2 or 3 from NODA (Hop Drop and Roll me). Prices are reasonable and there's always some sort of drink special. Pool tables and video games upstairs. Fussball, darts and lounge downstairs.  The front end (the bowling part) and the bar were run pretty efficiently - our waiter lane side was nice enough but a little awkward handling the Groupon and not the best server (also forgot my to go drink I ordered). The appetizers (pulled pork nachos and pretzels with beer cheese were both yummy - I just wished the portions were a bit bigger, especially the four nachos...)  We did have a blast! Very family friendly until the clock strikes 8PM then it's adults only! Discount or not, this place is pretty cool!",

Employees are always friendly and provide great service. Their drinks are great, and reasonably priced. Now to the best part.. the amenities! The new addition is the park (used to be parking lot) and outdoor space! We've been bowling several times and always enjoyed ourselves. It has been a great spot to bring people from out of town, and be able to have a variety of things to do! (Arcades, table shuffleboard, pool tables, ping pong tables and more!) Great spot to go with just one person, or a large group!",

    "text": "I've come here before with coworkers after work but this time was for a birthday bowling night and dinner. The entire hour we were bowling, no one came to ask if we wanted anything to drink, food, air, NOTHING. I went to the bar since I've visited before and got a few beers, went back to bowling and left my tab open. The bar was fine. When we were bowling the area was pretty packed so we didn't have a table.. once the party beside us left we decided to ask the front desk could we finally get a waiter to order food.... 30 min later our game was coming up on 5 min left and STILL no one had came to give us menus or take an order. A waitress finally came over and said I will try and get you 15 minutes more on the game so you can order some food (what that was going to do I'm not sure because I'm sure it would've taken longer than 15 minutes for food for all 5 of us to come). All in all she never came back so we took our shoes back and tried the restaurant to at least eat. (Part of the party drove from Troutman so finding another place to eat would've been difficult) The experience changed a bit for the better thanks to Dianna but there were still some minor things wrong with the other parties food like not coming out hot, but it was a quick fix. Food was good, we finally ate. Not sure if I would come back for a function like this. Fun place though, just needs more help I guess.",

I sat at the inside bar to watch the Cavs game and the bartender was MIA for nearly my entire visit. He never checked on me the whole time I was there. And, when he finally came back after I had been sitting for 15 minutes, waiting to cash out, it took another 10 minutes to get my check. (Two people sat next to me but left after sitting for 10 minutes without service.) When I complained to him, he blamed it on the computer being slow. Honestly, take some ownership, dude! I asked to speak to the manager afterwards but she was unavailable too. Guess it's the culture of the place.",

    "text": "Piedmont is a nice little spot located in Ayrsley. They have lots of tvs with a few bars and outside seating. They also have ping pong, pool tables, and bowling. We went here primarily to bowl so that is where my review will be focused. First it took 20 minutes just to get a lane with only 1 person in line in front of me and no one currently bowling. The 20 minutes was just waiting to check out as it appeared the cashiers were having issues with the system. Here you pay by the hour, and your hour starts 10 minutes after you checkout which isn't all that great if you have people running a bit late as the rest of our party waited in line to checkout 20-25 minutes as well after we did. The price is really expensive for the time you actually get to bowl, not to mention you have to go to the bar yourself for drinks which cuts down on bowling time once again. They need to rework this whole process. Their food and drinks are ok so I'd probably go to eat and play pool, but not for bowling again.",

It looked nice from the outside with lawn chairs and corn hole. Unfortunately, it was too cold out to play and you had to be standing directly on top of the heaters to feel any warmth.   Once we went inside it was a bit confusing. The hostess just stood their assuming we knew what to do..just wanted to eat and drink. We asked for a table for two and she led us to the isolated, enclosed bar away from all the people and the tv screens. Upon our request, we moved to a seat at the main bar. The bartender all seemed a bit socially awkward or really sad to be there.  The beer selection was good and the drinks were tasty but the food was not good at all. The \"famous\" chicken and waffles tasted like it came straight out of a indian restaurant and was full of curry seasoning and cumin. Good thing I like Indian food, but this was definitely not what I was expecting.   My dad had the veggie wrap and truffle fries. Neither of these were good.  I might return if I'm in the area just for drinks but definitely not for the food. Yuck!",

The experience started out with an intense ID review at the door. It has been a bit since I have been underage and I have no idea what to do when a bouncer furrows his brow and compares you to your ID. I usually opt for a cheesy smile but the scrutiny caught me off guard.   The space they have set up is really impressive. They have tons of square footage, shiny new bowling lanes and a neat upstairs area with arcade games. We went on a Saturday night and karaoke in the corner was in full swing in the back corner but we couldn't hear them at the table we found by the bar. The floor was very sticky and the chairs were a little uncomfortable.   Our waitress was super friendly and got our drink orders out quickly and our order of chicken tenders made it to our table in good time. They were delicious! Freshly fried and tender with the amazing awesome sauce and the maple honey mustard.   The food was good but the prices were a little steep (the beer we were drinking was $2 cheaper next door) and our server was prompt. I just wish there was something *great* about it to warrant the inflated price.",

The drinks from the bar took forever to make (as the female bartender was too busy joking with other patrons to make drinks) and then we watched the made drinks sit there and get watered down as the waitress was no where to be found to bring them to us from the bar. I ordered a salad and she forgot the dressing and again was missing to ask her for it and had to flag down another worker. The only plus was the food tasted good. They didn't seem busy but our server had us outside and apparently tables inside which seems like poor planning.  Disappointed as this place used to be spot on.",

It was pretty dead on a Saturday night, and I found the food and drink to be just average. You order your food/apps at the bar and take a number and they bring the food to you, which is nice. The Classic Burger was just ok, nothing special. Prices are reasonable. I'm not sure why it seemed so \"off\" when I went, but I think it has potential to be great with a large group of friends, or if you're looking for one place with lots of options where you can play board/arcade games, pool, ping pong and/or bowl, and even better, eat and drink while you do it.

The parking is terrible, don't waste your time looking for something close to the place, you have to just go straight to the Parking deck. Food is uniquely different ( a reason that makes us choose this place)   When the place is almost empty we go in to bowl before 6pm on a Fri. to play \"two for one bowling\", 2 people 3 games each (6 games total) some how totaled 18.00 with no shoe rental (3.00 per game not \"two for 1 bowling\").I didn't care about the price, we ended up buying 4 more games at regular full price.   We were placed between 2 groups of people, one side, all grown ups & non respectful bowlers & the other group with kids. The entire other set of lanes had no one on them.   When you request a lane, you have to tell them how many games you are going to play & you can not go over that, you have to get back in line & be put on a waiting list & wait your turn, I have no problem with this. However, we waited at our lane with 3 other lanes empty for 30 min. then they came back to us & said that we were next to bowl. they loose so much money here on the process of waiting & getting people to bowl.  There needs to be a faster bowling counter for service, someone is always waiting in line there. Every time there is a Question at the Bowling shoe counter, they have to go find a manager to answer the question. Very time consuming & costly.  We will go back but not as frequent & they need to get more confident workers that know Math & know how to space out bowlers.",

There was a long table in the second area of tables...which we proceeded to sit down at and we were  told we would have to move because that room was closing and they had no staff to work the room. The ladies in the hostess stand were not the least bit helpful, they had no answers for us, except to stand ...( remember this is a party of 10 and a baby ) until a few separate tables came available. Well, the Birthday Boy, went out and saw that the shift was changing as far as Management goes. He had a big talk with the GM who was extremely helpful, he placed us at the big table again..gave us a great waiter ( Wayne) and also a bottle of wine because they were out of the one we had ordered a lot  of us ordered the Chicken and Waffles which was great, the Burgers were good and, so are  the Fried Green Tomatoes! We then went bowling and had a great evening. It just goes to show you that One manager is not the same as the next. The GM is great there...the whole premise of the place is fun and has great food and drink! Try it!",

The service was friendly although a bit slow but the food and drinks were both mediocre, really not very good at all to be completely honest.   Drinks are small and have a microscopic amount of alcohol in them. The food was, in my opinion, likely frozen and reheated rather than prepared from scratch. The burger tasted like a Bubba burger and the mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box with a Kraft label on it.  Two stars are for the decent service and modern-ish atmosphere and amenities but I would not consider ever going back unless I knew the food had been completely changed.",

Hubs and I went for an outdoor screening of the Sandlot (one of the best movies ever). Very cool sounding concept except they took about 30 minutes or more to figure out how to set up the projector. They set up chairs and seating on their turf lawn, but they don't allow dogs on the turf so we had to sit in the way back since we brought ours.   After things got rolling, it was a nice night. I ordered wings and hubs ordered chicken fingers. My wings were pretty dried out and hubs chicken fingers were okay. If you wanted drinks, you could only order beers in cans to go on the turf.   The staff were not really the friendliest, but the events they host are pretty cool, so check it out for yourself!",

I ordered \"The Babe\" with a side of the smoke macaroni and cheese and an order of green beans. The sandwich had a very large serving of pulled pork and the sauce was delicious. The green beans were out of this word. The atmosphere was perfect for a Friday night and a bunch of ladies it for some drinks while on a business trip. We played some corn hole, ping pong and listened to music from the bar. I feel the prices were fair for the quality of the food. I have to give 5 stars because  the food totally makes up for the poor service.",

So, our 2nd game was cut off before we could finish it.  Could not find attendant, waited for a while, looked for someone to address the issue to no avail, so we left.  Will not return.",

Apparently a side salad may have meant full portion and bowl of soup could have meant \"cup\".  The server said both soups come in bowls.  Well so do other restaurants but call them cups, so I'm hoping this server was having a \"duh\" moment.  Service was nonexistent.  The server never checked back until I was finished eating and even then asked if I needed anything else.  I said no, thinking the check would be brought but it wasn't.  Once the check was dropped off, my companion, who was paying, left to use the restroom, came back, and the server still didn't pick up the check.  A manager finally walked by, took payment, and cleared the table.  On the way out, the server stopped us thinking we were dining and ditching, and even though the manager said we paid, the server wanted to be \"extra sure.\"  I felt humiliated by that action.  Drinks are overpriced.",

PSH is more of an entertainment complex than a bar and grill, they have everything from bowling, shuffleboard, darts, etc. In addition to all the entertainment there are two bars and a pretty decent food menu available too, which makes PSH the perfect place to unwind with friends or co-workers after a busy day in the office.  My first visit I arrived solo, and took a seat at the bar. I figured that I would order dinner and have a drink or two, as they had a large selection of North Carolina beers available on draft. For my entree I went with the Fried Chicken & Waffles, which was their signature fried boneless chicken tenders served over a fresh Belgian waffle drizzled with maple syrup mustard and served with a side of smoked gouda & cheddar man-n-cheese. The food was pretty good and the portion size was pretty generous too. The following evening I returned with a co-worker after having dinner nearby, we caught up on the day's events all while enjoying several local craft beers.  Overall the beer selection here is pretty diverse, however the focus is clearly on local beers. While I didn't have a chance to bowl or anything else I can see how this would provide an excellent evening out with friends, family, or even some co-workers. PSH provided me with two fun evenings while in town, and I will be back next time work brings me back.",

There were only pool tables and bowling alleys available so the front desk guy put us at a 90 minute wait for bowling at 7:30 but guess what, they close bowling at 9! No one seemed to care enough to tell us. Pool tables and equipment are crap. Bar service is terrible too. It took 30 minutes to get the bartenders attention, with 4 people sitting at the bar. I'll be taking myself and my visitors elsewhere going forward. Really disappointing.",

It's a good spot to hangout but don't count on being able to hear the conversation. It's pretty loud in there. My friend was sitting next to me and I could barely hear what she was saying to me. I do like how they have the upstairs loft area where you can play board games. I don't like how their after 10pm menu doesn't have appetizers. What late night menu doesn't have appetizers? I oredere the fries with all the fixes. They were good but the chopped up chicken tenders that come on the fries are a bit over seasoned.  I did have an issue. I asked for no peppers on my fries and the runner brought it out and it had peppers so I sent it back. 15 minutes later I still had no fries nor had we seen our server. I got the manager and she took care of it and comped the meal. So big shout out to management.",

TVs abound that are visible from any location to allow for easy viewing of any game.  The food was A-Okay.  Watch out for the sweet tea unless your sweet tooth is akin to looking for a diabetic coma.  The veggie wrap next time I would get it w/o the red onions & ask for lighter on the lettuce.  The green goddess dressing did not overwhelm the natural flavors of the veggies.  The carrots & celery that accompanied the chicken tenders should not have left the kitchen - white celery unless that is a new delicacy.  The chicken tenders themselves area ok.  Service is a little slow which is to be expected as the staff is covering multiple areas of the bar/restaurant.",

Expensive as fuuuuuuuuuck for food and drinks though. $95 for 2 orders of tenders, 2 shots, 1 craft drink, and 5 bud lights....wasn't very crowded for a Saturday..maybe due to Restaurant Week. A couple of the bartenders were friendly (Jamie and her fit brunette friend)...the tall skinny brunette upstairs had a HUGE d/stick up her ass though. The girls at the concierge stand were nice and I felt very safe as it was well lit and easy to navigate the different levels...food was good. Tenders and awesome sauce..outdoor bar was fun and the dude recommended a ginger beer/ vodka drink that came in a copper cup...pretty cool.  Might try it again.",

    "text": "I am so super excited about having this place in the area. I'll be honest there aren't a lot of good places for a person to hang out or even eat at around here. The food so far has been fantastic and a huge surprise. It looked good in pictures but as you know it rarely lives up to a photograph. I have to say PSH really almost has their menu on lock. It definitely has that NODA hipster feel inside with their beer and drink choices living up to that ideal. Honestly I don't hate it because it just all tastes and feels good. One big flaw in this place is their chairs. I have to say sooo many high tops and tall stool seating. I HATE this and it detracts from my experience. I'm short and find sitting in seats like that extremely difficult and uncomfortable. My best friend is 6ft tall and she found them to be highly uncomfortable as well. I didn't actually sit as getting up into one is awkward.  They have bowling, pool tables, video games, tv's etc. It's just a great hang out spot. The outside area should be really great once it cools off around here (although again with the high stool seating??) Get one giant screen tv and this could be my new Panther's spot assuming I can find a regular seat lol. I'm giving 4 stars as I test and feel this place out I think it will definitely jump up to 5!!",

The only negatives were that they were out of the garlic dipping sauce and a Noda beer. With just opening this week it was disappointing that they were already out of a product.

When we walked in, the hostess told us that there were no more tables available outside, only inside. We said that was great because we didn't want to be outside anyway, since it was so hot. What she didn't tell us after seating us with menus, is that no one would ever come back, even to at least take our drink order. The hostess walked by our table a couple of times and never said anything else, and the bar near us was closed. Thought this was strange on a Friday night. After several minutes, we finally got up and left. No one even noticed us on our way out, and we didn't see anyone around who worked there to complain to. We walked across the street to eat at Wild Wing, where we were seated immediately and had great food with great service. Not sure when or if we'll be back, even though we live close by.",

They can improve on ticket times and staffing as it seems they have lots of security but the waitstaff struggles to keep up.

Sorry but I find this very annoying, we came to play games an hang out but was unable to do so due to the ENTIRE place being reserved! I think they should have at least posted a sign on the front door warning customers that they were booked for the evening. Due to this very bad first experience I will probably never go back.",

It had a nice patio with a bar, a green space with games, tables inside, a back bar and 6 bowling lanes. It has so much potential...Unfortunately, the service was completely unacceptable. It took 15 min to get our first order of drinks, and then we could not find our waitress for long periods of time throughout the night. We all just started going directly to the bar to get our drinks. One time, we did that our waitress came back with the drinks that we had ordered 20 min before that must have been just sitting on the bar. Even as we tried to close out our tab, we couldn't find our waitress for more than 30 min. We finally told the bartender to have her come find us since we were going to bowl. Overall, the place has potential, it just needs a massive upgrade in its customer service to get people to come back.",

While the overall concept is great, the restaurant fails in execution. There are a few key challenges this restaurant faces: 1. The Service - the overall service is incredibly slow while the waiters/waitresses seem fairly unhappy, unwelcoming and unpleasant. In one instance, my friend asked for a refill of ice tea and said there was only a little remain because she wasn't going to make more. After dropping off our food, she never came back to our table. 2. The Food - Some items on the menu are super good (truffle fries, chicken fingers, chicken and waffle) however there are other items on the menu that are consistent poor, specifically the chicken wings and nachos. Select chicken wing seasons (i.e. Garlic and Parmesan) was painfully salty. 3.  Closing - On a Saturday night, they Begin flashing the lights at 11 or and then begin to forcibly request people to leave shortly before 12.  For a Saturday night, this was pretty surprising and a bit disappointing.  I'm not huge fan of giving critical reviews but I'd hate for other to go through what we have. We're attempted to go here several during different times of the day in hopes in would different. If anything, I hope this feedback helps the management team improve their overall approach and service.",

The second time I went there with friends.  A few of us had the chicken tenders and chicken an waffles.  The chicken tender (which were also on the chicken and waffles), was overly salty and peppery.  I couldn't drink enough water.  The server got all but one of the checks wrong.  The server got frustrated with us when we tried to explain who had what.  At the end, some of us paid more just to get out of there.  I'll try them again, maybe it was an off night...",

You won't run into good looking furniture that is not comfortable to sit on for some time like other places.   I cannot believe the fit 12 bowling lanes in that space without making it feel tight.  I think I counted at least 4 pool tables.  The local beer selection is awesome the signature cocktail we ordered came in a  what looked like as small old school milk jar (nice touch).  The shuffleboard table is sweet.  The old school video games are a really nice touch.  The COVERED patio is huge and rare,it has its own dedicated bar with a ton of taps.   There is a lot there were able to fit into the space without is feeling tight at all. I enjoyed the food a great deal, the sweet potato waffle fry app was very good and the tenders were very good, not run of the mill bar tenders. The \"Awesome\" sauce is amazing.  Last thing of note, I sat at one bar, opened a tab, it was accessible elsewhere which is really nice. There was not need to close out one place and then reopen just because you moved from one place to another. I understand why other places need to do this, but was just nice not to have to do so.",

Only minor complaint about the bowling was that 6 people can play but only 5 scores fit on the screen.   The drink selection is pretty bad. They did finally get an NC cider instead of just Angry Orchard though. Their cocktails are quite pricey and not worth it.   I've never been that impressed with their food. Everything I've had is pretty mediocre and nothing stands out.   The most disappointing part is the games. They used to let you play a handful of games for free -- pool, point pong, Cornhole. Now they seem to charge for everything.   I don't think it's anywhere near as good as Queen Park Social except that it's open more often during the day.",

    "text": "If it was possible to give this place zero stars I would.  I hate to give low reviews, but the manager I met of this location is incredibly rude and this place is so poorly run I'm surprised they have any business.    I met up with some people on a Thursday night.  I went inside to try to get a drink because the outside bar was crowded.  There were maybe 3 bartenders standing around inside.  They came up to us and told us the main bar was reserved for a private party so we had to get our drinks elsewhere.  Ok, fine - I go out to the outside bar, but apparently there was no way to get a drink from there (the line was very long and not moving).  My friends had been there for an hour and said they were still waiting on their food and one guy was waiting that long for his first drink.  At that point, I decided to go somewhere else since we weren't going to het service.  Fast forward a couple of months.  One night we had gotten some beer from the Beer Temple and decided to play some cornhole on the shared outdoor space (the Beer Temple has their own cornhole boards that don't belong to PSH).  That space isn't owned by PSH; it's an Ayrsley community space.  The manager came over specifically to us to see if we had bought anything from PSH and to try to get us to leave.  She did not aproach the other people who were clearly PSH customers.  Even when we informed her that we were allowed to be there, she was quite rude and clearly not happy that we weren't leaving.  When I went over there later to ask her about it, she said she talked to everyone there who was having a drink and made the excuse that she was liable for any alcohol purchased from PSH.  Apparently this is frequent that they are rude to the Beer Temple customers on the shared space.  There's really no excuse for this behavior to me.  I'm sure some people have had great experiences, but I will certainly not support a business like this.",

After 15 minutes we finally got our shoes but then the computer was locked and we had to wait for a manager to charge us / activate the lanes. 20 minutes after walking in the door we finally entered our names and started bowling.  There are 3 bars in this place, but the only one you can order from is outdoors? It's 97 outside. The bartender told us he would have the drinks sent to our table and when we tried to walk away he said \"wait, I'll just give you the drinks and you can carry them\" gee, thanks. We got some appetizers. The hummus was watery and the carrots did not seem fresh.  Pretzels were pretty good but that's kind of difficult to mess up. I do not recommend, and will not be returning",

The service has always been great for me and the food is classed up traditional bar food.  You have to try the chicken and waffles appetizer it's worth the diabetes.   Last time I was there a group of women had just come from seeing Girl's Trip and immediately bonded with my wife over how good the movie was. We didn't even know them. This has nothing to do with the restaurant but you should really go see Girl's Trip or get the Bluray when it comes out.",

I would come back here again for the ambiance and the beer!",

My honey enjoyed his chicken sandwich i had the wings which were good as well i played it safe and ordered wings because i really don't  see how any one can mess up wings to be honest. Our waitress/bartender Brittany was great and super witty. Wasn't crazy about the margarita was a little watered down house made tasting to me i more so like specialty margaritas so i will have to maybe try one of their specialty drinks next time i go. Im thinking about having my birthday party here this year.They have bowling, pool tables, ping pong and even more outside. Highly recommend Piedmont Social House to go on your to do list if you're looking for fun and games.",

This should be the go to spot to watch football games on Saturday and Sunday once football season starts.  There are multiple bars so it was easy to get a drink. There's an outside patio, bowling lanes, and pool on the main level. There's an upstairs area with a couple couches, chairs, etc. There are more pool tables, ping pong , and table games like jenga/scrabble also.   The only downside is there was no bar on the second level so you have to run downstairs every time you need a new drink. This is an awesome space and def.worth checking out.",

Someone else brought the food (not the issue), and we never saw our server again.  No one checked on us, our drinks were completely empty, and managers were walking around looking like there was nothing to do.  I had to get up to ask for a box as well as my bill.  Another 10 minutes went by before a manager came by with our check, and said, \"sorry, your server wasn't feeling good.\"  Not a great excuse.  If she knew the server wasn't feeling well, someone else (anyone else quite frankly) should have been checking on us.  Over 45 minutes with nothing.  I'm a server, and that would never be okay at the establishment I work at.  As someone in the industry, I'm very understanding, but this was pretty bad.  The manager really didn't seem to care much either.  Probably won't be back.",

    "text": "I think this place might've given me the worst experience I've ever had. I don't even write reviews, but this cannot be ignored. I don't even know where to start regarding how trash the service was. So my girlfriend and I met up with some family and friends for a birthday dinner. I think we showed up around 9:45. Nobody came to us, so we had to ask for a waitress, she didn't show up until 10:10, then had the GAUL, to tell us the kitchen closes at 10. Mind you, this place doesn't close until midnight, and it's a Saturday. After we explained to her that we had already arrived before 10, she reluctantly took our orders. We constantly had to ask them to refill our drinks, which only got refilled once. The rest of the times we asked, she never got back to us. After we were all done eating, we figured we'd bowl a bit. There were multiple open lanes. I go up to the desk and ask to reserve a lane (around 10:50), only to be told that they stopped booking people at 11. At this point I've already decided that they're getting a 3 star review, but there's more. So instead of bowling I ask if my conglomerate can reserve a couple games of corn hole, what do you think their answer was? They said it was raining so nobody else could play. Mind you, EVERYONE else was currently playing corn hole, and by rain they meant the drizzle drop of water that hit the top of my head one time. We literally tried to do everything this place with amazing potential had to offer only to be turned away every time. Which I found peculiar seeing as everyone else around us had no such issues doing all the things we wanted to do. They say they close at 12. But they really want you to leave around 10 so they can get out at 12 as well. Their saving grace was their wings which were pretty decent. I couldn't finish mine though so when I went to ask for a box (yes I had to ask for a box to someone else, our waitress was that horrible), the man in the back even blew a gigantic sigh in my face as if him getting a box was the tallest of tasks before he went and grabbed one with the worst sense of urgency I've ever seen in my life. As we were walking out around midnight, we saw another group of people up in arms because their bowling game had just been cut off mid game. I wouldn't recommend going to this place ever, under any circumstance, which is really disappointing because the between  venue, the games, and the food, there's so much potential here. The one thing they did a fabulous job of was making us feel unwelcome and unwanted.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting PSH, but I had heard good things about it. Well that it was a cool place and the atmosphere was good at least.   I booked a bowling lane for a late birthday outing last Saturday night. It was a little pricey, but overall not too bad. A few hours before the party was supposed to begin, I got a call from one of the staff members requesting that we push back the time of our event due to a request from a performer that was performing that night. This was perfectly fine and we had no hesitation to agree to this.   When we arrived, we spoke to the person that booked the reservation for us and things were fine right off the bat. We spoke to the girl that said she would be our server and taking care of up on our bowling lane. We grabbed a drink from the bar and went upstairs to watch the performance. After that, we went directly to our lane to begin bowling.   We realized that our server was nowhere to be found at this point and waited around for a bit to see if anyone would come over and help up. After about 20-30 minutes of bowling with no service, and trying to get a drink at the bar with no service, I finally went to talk to a manager to see if we could get some help. The girl finally came over to take our order.  We ordered a round of drinks, an appetizer and food for the 7 of us. The appetizer came out pretty quickly, but still no drinks. Then the food came out about 15 minutes later, but still no drinks. We tried to ask a couple people for napkins and silverware, but did not receive these either. I ended up having to go into the bathroom to get paper towels for us to wipe our hands on. Finally, half way into our meal, our drinks arrived. Well some of our drinks arrived, because they were out of one of the beers we requested for a bucket.   The service was ok after this, and the girl would come around about every 20 minutes or so to see if we needed anything. We finally realized that she was also waiting on the party of the performer at the same time, and that our party was kind of put on the back burner for this other party.   After our 2 hours of bowling ended, we decided to close out our checks. I stopped the server as she was walking by once to see if we could get our checks. I told her exactly what should be on the checks and went back to the lane to wait for them. After about 10-15 minutes, she came over to the lane and asked how we wanted the checks split, even though I had already told her. We told her exactly how they should be split again. We then waited and waited. After a legitimate 40 minutes, I decided to ask to speak to a manager. I told him what was going on and that we just wanted to get our checks and leave. He said that he would get them over to us as soon as he could. We waited another 10 minutes or so and he came over to our lane, but still did not have the checks. He asked what was going on and I told him what had happened over the course of the time that we had been there. He offered no help and pretty much told us that the checks took so long because they were trying to figure something out in the computer.  The server finally brought the checks over as we were speaking to the manager. We all put our credit cards in the slips and waited for her to pick them up. Another 10-15 minutes went by and she finally came back around to get them. Overall, it took us at least an hour to tab out once our lane was closed.   I am not one to complain or write a review about a restaurant because I was a server for most of my life, and I understand what it entails. This was different. This was just a blatant disregard for our party due to another more important party of a performer that was there. The manager that was on duty was also not helpful and did not provide a solution at all when told of what happened. I think that this place has the potential to be really great and a fun place to hang out, but it is run very poorly. I do not plan to return or recommend this place to anyone.",

I've been here a few times since they've first opened their doors and the food has always been a hit or miss. The first 2 times the food was on point, but several times after that it went downhill. I think i gave up on the food after this one night we were there and it just went all kinds of wrong. My group of friends and i ordered the winner winner chicken dinner that turned out to be the loser loser no dinner   The wait on the dinner itself took forever and then after all that waiting our fried chicken came out raw. Not once were we offered a complimentary appetizer or anything for our time. The chicken also came out raw the 2nd go around after they offered to fix it from the original error. To top that off, we weren't even offered to have our meals comped, i had to escalate it to a manager to have it done. On that note, I've taken a step back on dining here but will stop in for a delicious drink or 2. I gave them 2 stars because of the food being a disaster but the drinks are at least a 4 star.",

We got the chicken and waffle sliders which come with a spicy mustard sauce on the side instead of syrup?!? The chicken tenders were alright and the waffles were actually good.  We asked the waitress for syrup and she returned with two small dishes of it, it wasn't enough and by the time we realized it and asked for more the food was cold.  I ordered a side of Mac and cheese which didn't come out until I asked the waitress about it.  When it did arrive it was lukewarm at best and was nothing more than noodles in a thin cream sauce, yuck...so disappointing. I ordered one of the cocktails, it was green, I forget the name but it tasted like cough syrup and I had to send it back. I drank my husbands drink instead which wasn't much better. When the check came she charged us for the drink I sent back, when I brought to her attention she took it off but overall this place is best I would say for bowling and shooting pool, please don't expect good or even alright food or cocktails.  If I ever return it will be with a group for the games and recreation and I'll order something they can't mess up like a soda!",

They had the cutest little finches hopping around the sidewalk while you eat. Today must have been a good day to see the nature around you.   The bar tender took my order he was pleasant and friendly. He kept the drink refills coming. I tired their weekly special. It was an IPA Smash Burger. I am not a big burger person but they had me sold when they put beer battered Gouda bites on the burger. The flavor of the burger was well throughout and it held together while being eaten.   When leaving, I asked if I could take a picture of the special sign they said of course. The manger was out front and he asked if I liked the burger and I said yes it was very good. He said the chef created a marinade for the meat. He tired the marinade and thought it was gross. Ha, ha. The chef said wait until the flavor is in the burger meat, customers will love it. The chef was right it was super flavorful and yummy!   The manager and staff were all super friendly. They mentioned they deliver to my hotel if I wanted to try other food items. I would recommend trying this place.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Piedmont Social House. We had a group of 28 ladies on a Saturday morning in August and we arrived unannounced. The General Manager, Matt was on site and he quickly determined the most efficient way to seat and serve our large party in the patio area. Thankfully it was a pleasant day with low humidity and a little breeze. We were not able to be seated which was a bummer, but we were seated in the same area at 5 tables. Staff quickly took our drink orders and when returned our entree order was taken. Our wait staff was nice and attentive and our meals come in a reasonable amount of time and as requested. To my knowledge no one had to send anything back. One of our tables however took a little longer to get their order, but we expected a delay. The GM gave me his card and  encouraged me to call ahead next time. I did tell him that I tried to make a reservation and was told that the minimum would be $500 that would go towards food and beverage. This was just a few ladies having lunch and no one had $500 to shell out. The food was fresh and delicious and most everyone was pleased with their meal. Cost were very reasonable too along with portion sizes received. We were impressed with the  Service we received at Piedmont under these circumstances.",

    "text": "I visited this place a week after they first opened and frequent here for lunch to meet with former colleagues/friends in the area. The food is good and is always corrected if I have an issue (rarely), but the service has been on a steady decline.   The final straw came on yesterday. My team and I went out for lunch to celebrate a birthday (total of 6 people). We arrived and were seated around 11:50am. We were greeted by two different waitresses, but informed the second one that the first had already taken our drink orders. We received our drink orders and waited for a waitress to return to take our orders. At this point, we place our food orders around 12:05pm with hopes to get our food soon. We received our food at 12:54pm... all with the exception of one. The guy that brought the food said that he would be right back with their order. After around 7 minutes, our waitress came by to let the person know that the kitchen loss the ticket. Without offering any solutions other than \"yeah, I don't know what happened\" (mind you this person still doesn't have food after an hour), the manager walks over and states that she will make sure that he gets his order and will make it to-go. The manager said she knew what he ordered but then asked him to tell her (what?). At this point, I'm embarrassed because this is a place I recommended for lunch, as it was a nice day to get out of the office and it was someone's birthday. The manager then returns around 1:17pm with a to-go bag, places it on the table then walks away (I would state her name, if I knew it but it wasn't shared and no one caught it from her name badge, unfortunately). She brought back the check and apologized... before she could walk away again, we asked that she wait to take the payment to close out the tab, as many of us were now late to a meeting. At NO POINT did our waitress come back to check on us from the time we received our food (outside of coming by to blame the mishap on the kitchen) to the time we left the restaurant. Thankfully, the hostess stepped up and refilled drinks for my table and another table beside us.   It would be understandable if they were understaffed... but they were not as there was more than enough staff to help pitch in. However, it was evident that team work doesn't make the dream work here because those that didn't have a table just cleaned off tables that were already cleaned or checked on the few tables on the patio. To say the least, I will not recommending this place for lunch again, thoroughly disappointed with the service.",

Guess who agreed we should have went to Wild Wing?? Mary Jo obviously didn't want to be at work, scowl on her face, consistently wiping sweat from her brow and not one time did I see her use a towel or go to the rest room to wash her hands. Very short, never offered drink menu, never asked if we had been there before, never suggested appetizer or asked if we wanted to order one. I assume since we were a table of two and not a party.od.6 or more as the other two tables she was working we were less important. I will NEVER go back here with the service I was provided. The runner that brought the food was ok until I asked for additional BBQ sauce for my barbecue sandwich that was dry.  Seemed that I became an inconvenience because I needed something.",

We also ordered a bottle of red wine who the bartender turned into sangria for me after I saw that someone else had ordered sangria.   The atmosphere here is fun and lighthearted. I somehow found myself in a strangers game of table tennis and completely forgot about my friends and finished the night with this new crew I joined.   My only complaint, is that they shit down the games so early on a Friday night.",

The bouncer (man with dreads) asked as for IDs even though ID check didn't start until 8pm. My 13 yr old does not have an ID. As the bouncer kept telling us we couldn't enter, 4 little girls ran past him and went inside. He did not say anything to them and didn't ask for their parents/IDs and kept pointing to the sign saying \"21+ ID check after 8pm.\" It made no sense. I will not be a customer here again. #smdftb",

I've ordered the shrimp tacos (3 out of 5) and the chicken fingers (4.5 out of 5) with fries both times. The fries are very delicious, especially with ranch or honey mustard dipping sauce. They do have $5 mimosas, but that isn't a huge deal compared to other restaurants around. The outside area is nice...complete with high-top and low-top tables, a bar, and outside games such as giant Jenga, connect 4, badminton, etc. There is also an area inside to eat as well with a bowling alley! Talk about a great place to come for good food and a little fun as well. They also host movies on the lawn which would be a great summertime activity for you and the kids. My only complaint is parking for this area. There are a lot of other shops around, so it can get a bit congested. Other than that, tasty food and good service!",

We decided to stick with water since we knew this was not going to be a good experience. I wanted to leave honestly. We ordered food and it looked better then it tasted.

I must say this place has truly changed tremendously which is why I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.  Walking in as my family was already here at there lanes they had several issues with getting their lanes. Once they got that situated we were ready to order food but there was no servers around. They have signs on the tables \"please see bar for service\". So you have to go to one of the two bars to order your food. And if you have a large party like we did good luck!   This was honestly horrible for a Saturday, I would expect this for a Monday through Friday open to 6pm hours but not for a Saturday at 7:45pm.   Our food came out and I wasn't impressed at all. I had the truffle fries and they were alright. My mom had the nachos and they were under seasoned. Even the pic de Gallo was messing a lot of flavor. The wings weren't good either. The chicken and waffles were flavorful But that's it. After we finished eating no one came to pick up our plates. We had to put our plates on the side ledge where the wheelchair ramp was located. The tables were too small to house all the plates we had from our orders. We had party was large and we had no other place to put them. What kind of food establishment doesn't pick up their customer plates, until they see them piled up on the side. We didn't receive and silverware so I personally had to go outside to the host stand to get silverware at least four times.   This place has truly changed since I first came here and reviewed it. I now see why no one comes here anymore and the rating is so low.",

    "text": "Looking for a place that has great food, a tap room, games and a 12 lane bowling alley? Then head to Piedmont Social House, located in the popular Ayrsley neighborhood of Charlotte. It is a one stop destination for an afternoon or evening of food,drinks and fun! The atmosphere here is energetic and lively. It is a great spot for groups or a fun date night. There is something for everyone in the family. The service was good and so were their Chicken and Waffles! I also recomment one of theor cocktails called 'The Irish Mule' , which is like a Moscow Mule but uses Irish Whiskey +ginger beer instead. They have a Happy Hour that I missed just by a few minutes as it ends at 6p. Also there is a Kids Menu for parents who may want to go enjoy an early dinner with their kiddo like we did!",

    "text": "I was not impressed or pleased with my experience at Social House.  I went with a group of friends and we later had three people join us.  We asked could an extra table be added (which were all empty to the left of us) and we were denied as it was stated the table belonged to another waitress/section.  That didn't make any sense to me as I believe you should always be accommodating to your guest(s), especially if every one is ordering.  One of the ladies at the table ordered an adult drink and she did not receive it until being done with her meal while others at the table had already received theirs.  She even reminded the waiter.  Another person ordered chicken & waffles and requested more syrup and was told extra syrup costed $0.75.  First, the amount of syrup they provide you for Belgian waffles is ridiculous.  Who wouldn't need more?  Second, a 24 FL Oz bottle of syrup on average cost about $2.00, if not a little more, so where is the absurd price coming from?  I could provide example after example as to why this was not a satisfying experience.  However, I will conclude my review here. My two stars are solely based on being pleased with the taste of my chicken and waffles. My wish is that management will take the reviews into consideration and reevaluate how they can make their business a more enjoyable place.",

    "text": "I've been here several times without any issues but this last time was just bad. We came in around 1030pm to eat and drink and maybe play pool. The guy checked our ID's at the door and there was a hostess stand outside but no hostess. There was a sign that said please wait to be seated. We waited a few mins and no one came. So we went inside to try to find someone. Waited several more minutes. The bowling station was busy so we couldn't ask there. My husband finally stopped a bartender and he told us to go back outside and he will get a hostess. Finally, a hostess came with a HORRIBLE attitude. Almost as if we were bothering her for doing her job. She doesn't even ask how many. Doesn't even greet us or says hi. She just told us we had to sit inside. I asked if we could sit outside and she said no because there was going to be a over 30 min wait. I found that hard to believe because no one else was waiting and there were several tables outside. We ended up eating inside because I was sick of her attitude. She seats us and throws the stuff on the table, doesn't even put the menu on each seat and walks off. To make it worse, there was 5 of us. She literally dropped off two silverwares and two menus. She couldn't even give us enough for 5 people.   Our bartender was nice but I thought it was strange that he asked for our ID's again even though we got carded up at the front. I got nachos and other people got different foods. It was obvious my nachos were made first before everyone else's because my nachos were cold and soggy. The cheese had that layer on it as if it was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We had to ask our server for silverware since the horrible hostess didn't give us enough.   This place is seriously going down hill.",

It took us over an hour between a group of 8 to place drink orders which ate into our hour of play time. The manager did understand, and competed an additional hour, but the problem at the bar persisted. The bar tender seemed incompetent, and the inside of the facilities were rather dirty. I was excited to check this place out and left very underwhelmed. Hopefully this is something that can be fixed and others have a better experience.",

    "text": "I was really excited to visit this place since it opened up but was very disappointed after.  I went on a Saturday night around 10:30pm.   Note; there is a ton of construction going on around the place.  They do check ID so have it ready at the door.  Once inside the decor was a mixed between strike city and hickory tavern restaurant.  We decided to get a bowling lane and order food there.   The Staff registering the bowl lanes were polite and helpful but seem nervous about not making mistakes.  Which they did with us by not letting us know which lane to go to.  Note: this was out first time here so we don't were to go.  I asked her which lane are we supposed to be at and she kept apologizing and told me to hold on.  I ended up figuring it out on my own and just confirmed it with her. Once we got to our assigned lane we got our balls to bowl and were looking for a waitress to assist us.  No one came!  So I decide to bowl and keep an eye out for a waitress, still no one came!  Then to top that the bowling lane wasn't gloss properly so it would make you trip up if you tried to roll your ball.  We were so hungry for food with no service that I didn't even mention that to the staff. I decided to look for someone to serve us at the bar and still I got no service!!! All of the staff seem so concerned with talking with each other instead of trying to serve a customer.  So by this time I was upset and went looking for a manager that I have to wait even longer for.  Once she did arrive I explained to her that we haven't had service since we go to our lane.  She apologized and said she would handle it but that's what she is supposed to do.  By this time, I already had a sour taste in my mouth about the place. She tried to smooth it over more by giving us an extra game of bowling but I ended up sending 73.00 that night on bowling and food.  So comping me a game means nothing to me.  All I will say is first impressions last impressions and I will not be going back again.  I have been to many mixed entertainment establishments (Strike City, Ten Lanes, etc.) and by far this is the worse.",

    "text": "We checked out this new and much-needed addition to Ayrsley with some friends over the weekend.  As we walked up to the place, I was amazed with how big it is!  It takes up the whole freakin' building.    There is a big outdoor patio area with tables and TV's.  If outdoors just isn't for you, there is a good amount of seating inside although they didn't have a big enough table inside to accommodate our party of 8.  One issue with the outdoor situation:  there were people standing around all over the place smoking out there.  I don't know if they have yet to define a \"smoking area\" or what, but they need to do something about it because it's obnoxious to the 90% of us who do not smoke.    As you walk inside, you'll get a real perspective on just how massive the PSH is.  There's a bar to the immediate left and booths and tables, and there are tables scattered all about the place as well.  You'll also notice the bowling lanes!  There are 12 available for use, if my memory serves me.  In the back, there are pool tables as well as another pretty large bar area.  If you're looking to have some beverages while you're here, you shouldn't have a problem at all!  Speaking of beverages, there is a pretty good beer and cocktail list at your disposal.  When you go upstairs, you'll find some old-school arcade games like Mortal Kombat II, NFL Blitz, and Pac-Man.  There are just a few so far, and I hope they plan to add to the collection.  There are also more pool tables as well as ping pong tables.  If you're looking to play pool, you're going to have a pretty good chance at finding a table.  We had food while we were here and it was pretty decent.  The menu is essentially bar food with a Southern twang. I had the catfish and grits which was pretty on point.  Our waiter was good but had some issues when it came to splitting up the check.  There were a few kinks with the service that I'm sure they'll sort out.      All in all, this is a really cool addition to Steele Creek and I think there is tons of potential for this to be a really popular spot!",

This is great to know that there is an adult friendly place to go to without kids after hours. My son and a friend went bowling, and they had fun. I appreciate the fact that they also are ada friendly with access to the lanes for a wheelchair. Ive never been here before but does appear very promising with plenty of different options for  things do to include pool. While I didn't sample the menu for drinks or food I will be back to try some things out. Its really nicely decorated on this inside and it is also split level.",

The beer cheese and pretzels were excellent though. same for the sweet potato fries \"loaded\" w/blue cheese and some type of sauce.  the chicken and waffle enter was good, but too much for me.  Friends had the sliders and that would've been a perfect portion.  My husband said he would get the hamburger every time we go back, it was that good - and very big.  There was a nasty beer on the menu, but I think they took it off that same night - it was pretty horrible (think: pickle juice and/or wet dog taste).  The grandma's cough syrup was NOT a lemon drop martini, wouldn't get it again as an avid lemon drop drinker.  The liquid marijuana and nature boy were good though.  we were able to play pool, ping pong and Jenga the whole night and ended up staying about 6 hours.

They never checked on us again. Took another 20 minutes to get refills and we finally asked the hostess to bring us our drinks.   The waiter was missing in action... our check was finally given to us again by the hostess after waiting and waiting for the waiter to show.  The only bonus was the cocktails were delish.  As for service and food quality, don't waste your time.",

    "text": "So... I came here for the Yelp Elite Event and this place is freaking awesome.  My mind was blown.   Location: its great having some where cool to hang out that's on the south side of Charlotte. It's trendy enough to be in Noda and cool enough to be in Epicenter.  But  I'm glad that it's not.  It feels good to have something this cool in Ayrsely.   Amenities: they have plenty of pool tables, ping pong tables, board games, arcade games, shuffleboard, foosball table, corn hole in the patio, tons of TVs, and bowling lanes.  Again...how cool is this place.    Food: I was able to sample some of their food. The chicken and waffles was really good. The pretzels with the beer cheese was magnificent. The chicken tenders with their spicy Polynesian sauce was the perfect duo. The chicken and pimento cheese wraps and the veggie wraps was just as good.   Beverages: we were able to try some of their vodka drinks with sweet tea.  They were sweet but strong.  A definite crowd pleaser.   Service: its great to know that a place with great amenities can still provide excellent service.  All the waiters and waitress was tentative to our needs and they were really friendly.  I even found out that one of the waitress lives across the street from my neighborhood.  And the manager, Todd made sure that everything was perfect. He even gave a hug to my husband and I.  I'm so glad that he put everything into this establishment. It shows.  It's rare for me to give a perfect rating, but its a honest and accurate rating.   Parking: its not the best, but its free parking and ample amount.  It's a busy area but I was able to find  parking.   Everything was perfect here. The only thing that I didn't inquire about was security.  If people gets rowdy, I'm not sure if they have security.   But I'm sure Todd has that figured out already.  :)",

There were people outside having a good time, but we didnt realize there would be a bowling alley in the place!!  The food was pretty good, I got a chicken wrap with pimento cheese (unfortunately can't remember the name of it) and a side of mac and cheese (which was a sub from the fries that were supposed to accompany the dish).  Our waiter was very friendly, the food was really good! (My friend had the spinach as a side, and it was seasoned pretty good!).  The drinks looked good, but we didnt try them this time.   We will definitely be going back! Its nice to have a place like this closer to where i live, as opposed to having to travel all the way to uptown or Dilworth for something like this.  Would recommend, but not if you like quiet!!",

Even though she was still serving others and it says they close at 11 not 10:30. As someone who works in the service industry and just wanted ONE drink after working....I was very disappointed by this.

We have finished eating our dinner and paid our bill I asked for a styrofoam cup with water to take outside with me to go play corn hole while my friends continued to finished they beer. The waiter told us we cannot take any alcoholic beverages outside but we can purchase can beer and that will be allowed outside and we totally understood. The waiter gave me a water and me and my friends proceeded to go outside. I was approached by the manager Jessica and she said you cannot take alcoholic beverages outside, I informed her that this is water not alcoholic she said to me \"that is not water\" I told her this is water in the cup so she said you cannot take the cup outside the premises and I said ok no problem and I went back to my table and place the cup down and proceeded outside with my friends to play corn hole. Approximately 2 hours later I went back into social piedmont to use the bathroom and the waiter was in the restroom as I walked in, I was on the phone laughing and I said Im from NY to the person I was talking to on the phone and the waiter said \"Im from up to too so I don't know why the fuck you laughing for, so apparently she must of thought I was laughing at her.   As I proceeded to walk out  Piedmont Social to only have the manager Jessica to come up in my face and tell me I will not allow you to be disrecptpful and threatened my employees. I looked at her and asked what are you talking about, she proceeded to say you mad from earlier because I didn't let you take your cup outside I said absolutely not your rules is your rules But Im very upset that you approached me and accused me of being disrespectful and cursing your employee out. I would never do that. I asked the manger can she give the waiter name with corporate email because I would like to write them and let them know how Im being handled and treated. She refused and wouldn't give me the waiter name or email I asked her twice and she said \"No\", I than asked her why is you treating me this way is it cause I'm black she just batted her eyes like I wasn't even talking to her at that point with no cooperation with the manager I just walked out the store. I will never ever spend my money in there.  The manager in Piedmont Social Jessica is very prejudice.  Jessica approached me and accused me of threatening her employee which is a serious allegation, as being a manager her approached was not professional at all.",

You know the one: you were only friends with him because he had arcade games, a bowling alley, and a pool at his house.  Otherwise, he was intolerable.  Well, PSH doesn't have a pool but it does have a two bars (plus one outside), two bowling alleys, pool tables, ping pong, old school arcade games, and various spots to just hang out.    The menu is good and I highly recommend the Foghorn.  Plus, their mambo and awesome sauces are killer.    If there were a few head scratchers, it would start with the overwhelming amount of guys wearing yellow \"security\" t-shirts.  They are imposing like bouncers and spread throughout the place; which seems unnecessary at 6pm on a weeknight.  Maybe 2am on a Saturday but it's a bit much early.  This is something I expect is still being dialed in.    The other head scratcher are the bowling alleys.  I love the idea but the sound of balls hitting the floor is all-consuming - especially for people who think you literally throw a bowling ball.  Still, the place is cool and definitely worth checking out.",

When I got there at the time it was scheduled, it was not set up. I went inside to ask what was going on and they informed me they had moved it somewhere else. OK?  Come to find out, they had put my party on the other side of the patio that was completely roped off and covered with awnings and there was heat! Management came and informed me that they did not want my party outside due to this random May cold weather 58 that I worried about throughout the day. This by far was impressive. They took the extra mile to make my birthday wonderful. Food was out on time like I asked, hot and tasted amazing! We had an awesome server, Jake (not from state farm lol), he as well made the experience great. He's definitely someone that I would come back to see!  This place treated my family, friends and myself fantastically and made this day special! Thank you PSH! SAMANTHA BRAUN!",

Piedmont has some weird policies regarding their bowling service and these two were very unhelpful and quite frankly, rude. Geri was better than Jess, but dealing with them was a hassle and just put a damper on my experience. We had a big party and wanted two lanes, apparently this was a problem. A few wanted to pay for multiple people but, Jess (with an attitude) kept insisting this was impossible and that separate transactions were needed to pay for each bowler. I'm sorry (not really), but that is messed up..what if you brought your family of 6 and had to pay for all of them... you are telling me that I can not pay for all of them together and must swipe my card 6 times to cover my party.... get out of here. She argued with us for a good amount of time, my friend eventually got sick of hearing her argue and just swiped his card multiple times.   4 stars for everything else. Other than that, we had a great time. The bowling was fun, the servers were friendly. Though was a little irked at the fact that a car bomb was $10 and no drink specials were available, but that wasn't a huge issue.   Piedmont, check the attitudes on your employees manning the cashier desk. Especially Jess Johnson.

    "text": "AVOID AT ALL COSTS.   Came tonight to the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I left without sipping my water. My I stayed here 0:07 too long, and I regret not getting our server's name. We were a party of 7.  My date and I had come in a few minutes after the other 5 having had trouble finding parking.  We were not acknowledged upon arrival, and no hostess was to be found. After standing around uncomfortably for about 0:04, a nice group of folks, whom had been waiting for the elusive server to return to their table, offered theirs that was adjacent to ours.  Our party had been previously seated, but for whatever reason, shorted our table by two chairs. We were grateful to have been offered the recently used table.   We pushed the table and chairs together, waited about three minutes, and with no greeting, the waitress comes to the table to ask \"who is new?\" Our party found this odd, but we answered the question. This was now the time to give our drink orders. The EXTREMELY limited menu for late night (it was 20:30) was ridiculously overpriced. 13:00 for chicken wings that don't even come with sides? Please.   I'm getting frustrated even replaying the night in my head, trying to relay what happened tonight. Long story short, she scolded us for pushing the tables together, asked if we had gotten permission from the non-existent hostess, and neglected to get the table cleaned off before she brought us our waters. She was visibly and audibly frustrated when we asked questions about the menu. The last straw for us was when we asked if she could get someone to clean off the table. She rolled her eyes at us, said \"sure\", and stomped off. We made the executive decision that our hard earned money would not be spent at this establishment.   When we brought the matter to the attention of mgmt, they were just as helpful and friendly. They questioned why we thought this was \"bad customer service\" and noted that they would have a talk with her. The \"bouncers\" who constantly told us we had to clear the way as we were waiting to speak with mgmt were a joke too.   Not worth the frustration. We were served our drinks in dirty glassware, no host to be found for proper seating, and customer service was completely absent. Would have given a zero if I could. Never again.",

Their dry rub wings are awesome as well as their Bang bang pulled bbq chicken sandwich. Want an appetizer? You can't go wrong with the beer cheese pretzels, delectable! My fave is their meatballs and mash. Sitting outside is cool especially with the live events! Very cordial staff, sometimes it can be lengthy to get a seat, also since I live here parking is not a problem but for anyone coming in it can be the biggest headache. I suggest you park in the concrete jungle ON THE FIRST FLOOR otherwise you can get ticket our towed, or behind the YMCA.",

When we told the guy at the stand, where you buy your game and get your shoes to play bowling, that we were celebrating a birthday, birthday boy's first game was free. Awesome.  I ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese and I wasn't so much of a fan. I liked the beer cheese however, I think it would have tasted better if it were hotter. The pretzels were okay. They were a little dry.  We then ordered the loaded fries with all the fixins which never fails. It was great. I love fries.  I would have liked if they had a larger menu.

On a side note the bowling is a lot of fun so there is typically a wait put down your name ahead of time if your going to dine at a table. The nearby parking garage was easy to enter and find a spot in easy walking distance. We happen to come during the Bacon and Beer festival and was able to benefit from the amazing live music that was coming from the court yard.

We walked through and checked out the bar, bowling alleys, pool tables, foosball, and the arcade corner with Mortal Kombat and Galaga!! There were lounge areas, and plenty of space upstairs to chill or engage in games. But the weather was perfect so we ate outside. High top and low top tables were available in a fully covered outside dining spice. Flat screens lined the wall of the building, and the outside bar had plenty of local brews on tap, along with the usual buds, millers, and Belgian wheats.   Good service. Fun atmosphere !! And the chicken and waffles were surprisingly good for a spot that I would classify as a bar style game room.    I'll definitely be returning for some bowling with friends in the near future !!",

The large space is divided into several sections to accommodate large parties or comfy enough for a date night. We enjoyed 2 games of pool on one of the 4 pool tables that you can rent for $10 per hour.  There's several ping pong tables on both levels and outside on the patio. There's plenty of fun board games you can choose from off a shelf or enjoy playing your favorite old school arcade game like Pac Man. The patio are is huge with its own bar and TV's  Food selection was typical bar food with a twist,  ($8-$13) the Nachos we ordered was topped with shredded BBQ chicken, yum yum yuuuum!  I will be trying the Chicken and Waffles on my next visit; they look yummy. The mixed drinks were a bit pricey at $10-$13 and they have a good selection of beer on tap $5.   The reason for the 3 stars is because of the extra extra large space and only 4 pool tables and the  $10-$13 mixed drinks.",

    "text": "I have to say, I am extremely disappointed in my visit this past Friday to PSH. I was there two weeks ago for the Yelp Elite event during their grand opening week, and everything was absolutely amazing. There was over 80 people in the Yelp group, and the food was still cooked perfectly and came out pipping hot despite the craziness. After having such a great first experience, I've been telling my family how awesome this place is and talking it up as if I was on PSH's payroll. After our experience this weekend, my in-laws may have serious doubts in my restaurant/social event decision making.  We got there about 8:15 on Friday night, it was busy, but nothing crazy. The 6 of us were able to get a table on the patio with no wait. Our server (Tilah) was very friendly, but almost seemed like this was her first serving job. After about a 10 minute wait, she finally came over and we were ready to put our drink orders in ASAP. Now, I understand that PSH is new and wants to make sure everything is done by the book, but my mother-in-law had lost her driver's license, and Tilah would not take her glass of wine order without an ID. Mind you, she's 60 years old, CLEARLY well over the \"if you look under 30, we ID\" policy most restaurants follow. Ridiculous if you ask me. The server took our 5 beer orders while my MIL searched for her id, and came back with the beers 15 minutes later. Another 15 minutes after that, the wine finally came out.   Luckily the food came out pretty fast ... much faster than the beers & wine did. Unfortunately, none of the food wowed any of my visitors. My chicken & waffle (which was AMAZING the first time I had it here two weeks ago) was awful. The waffle itself was great, and the sauce was just as I remembered, but the chicken tenders served on it were almost burnt to a crisp. In the 10 minutes between uploading a picture and writing this review, a fellow Yelper already commented on it with \"how did they even let that leave the kitchen?!\". My father-in-law ordered the Veggie Patch Wrap, which he said was very little veggies and all wrap. My mother-in-law ordered the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, and her chicken was as burnt/crispy as mine was. My wife's PSH Signature sandwich was also extremely crispy, albeit not as rough as mine was. My other two in my group also got the PSH chicken, and neither was impressed.   Again, I think I'm the most upset because I know how good the food was the first time I was here, so this was just a total let down, especially with having brought my in-laws from out of state here. I'd love to give this place another try and write this off as them having a bad night, but everything about this visit was just bad.",
