The selections are all mindfully selected, from the artisanal cheeses to the craft beer and everything in between. Also a great place to pick up a gift for a foodie or hostess, kitchen gadgets and bar wares are scattered through out the store. Menu items aren't worth mentioning by name because it's constantly changing. Free parking across the street.",

However, I can't say much about it beyond that. I found the food to be average and overpriced. They had nice finds in the grocery area but again are expensive so you definitely don't want to make it a place you go to often. However, it is indeed a place to splurge on great cheese, etc. There was one item I do have to give praise and that is the lobster roll. Great flavor and probably three times what I can get in NY for half the price.",

If you park along Elizabeth during the workday weekdays you will have to park in a metered spot probably.  The interior is a little small but that's OK.  The offerings range from pre-made foods to freshly prepared sandwich and salad offerings as well as specialty soups.  I browsed the beer selection and it also seems pretty solid.  They offer a wide range of wine as well.  Seating is in the front of the place and while I was there near 12:30 pm it looked pretty packed and obviously a popular lunch spot.  Don't come here looking for your traditional groceries, this is more along the lines of a Common Market/Health Home Foods Market hybrid.  Nice addition to the area.",

I enjoy their coffee and lattes, and sadly haven't tried many of their pastries, though the cookies are good. I love that you can grab a meal, get work done, and even grab some gourmet groceries to take home. I always have a good time checking out all the fun, and often local, speciality ingredients. I have driven there just to buy Callie's Hot Little Biscuits from the freezer section to take to family in Michigan. In terms of order, I like the daily changing menu but it's sometimes hit or miss. Over the summer they had an amazing chilled noodle bowl salad, I ate it about 4 times in a matter of weeks. The salads are good, including the current fall-inspired salad. I most recently ordered the grain bowl with butternut guacamole. I found the flavors lacking and everything kind of watery, I was also disappointed with the portion size for the price compared to other menu items. It wasn't bad but it wasn't very good either, and I was hungry about 2 hours later. Ill still keep going back and hope to make to Sunday brunch and to grab a cheese and charcuterie plate some time soon.",

They make their own kimchee and they top grits with white cheddar, the kimchee, some greens and pulled pork. Jeeeeezus. Loved it. Served nice and hot! You put in your order and they make it fresh for you, call your name and you grab a table. They also have a barista station where you can get coffee or tea and a baked good.

    "text": "Happened upon this place on a lunch with a coworker that was running an errand and I was immediately ticked off: How many of you people knew about this place and didn't tell me?! Earl's is the best! Grocery store and restaurant all wrapped up in one. If I worked near here, they would get all of my money, all of the time! Shoot, they still might!  The cashier was incredibly helpful. She gave suggestions and explained dishes. I ordered the special (well, one of them. They have a couple different ones a day): the meatloaf sandwich on Texas toast. Gaaaaaaah! It was an open faced sandwich and it was insanely good. I don't even like mushrooms, but I ended up eating those. The tomato sauce was out of this world. They melted a single piece of cheese across the top and it was heavenly. My coworker got the soup bowl with ramen and she loved it! She also didn't share, so I was kind of sad. lol I watched them prepare a couple of other meals since I had never been there and they all looked appetizing. I totally have my eye on the warm bowl for my next visit.  Burnt butter chocolate chip cookie? Hmmm. Don't mind if I do and glad I did! Take my advice and just do it, if sweets are your thing. You know I like treats and this one had that salty sweet combo down pat!  Specialty grocery items? Yep. Pastries and such? Uh-huh. Ridiculously yummy lunch options? Hells yeah. They even have semi-prepared food you can take home to fully prepare yourself that is already seasoned. I'm so glad I finally stumbled onto this place. Somebody call The Fiance and break the news: I don't know who Earl is, but I'm love with him.",

The Farro was good, the currants were delicious but the pumpkin seeds were legit. I wish they had massaged the kale. Good thing I like tough kale. The golden beets are sweeter than red beets so they provided a nice compliment to the bitter kale and the salty pumpkin seeds. I can't wait to come back and camp out for the day. Earls has a mini coffee shop, bakery, and does lunch entrees and sandwiches, AND has tempting and tasty looking sides and meals you can purchase too! Plus a cute little wine shop and space for getting work done. Earls, you have a good thing going here. Elizabeth street is becoming my new favorite street in Charlotte.",

Because we will be back.  This is one of those places you visit where, after the visit, you find yourself thinking about it and being pulled back. Just be sure you check website for their hours. They are tricky. For instance: Don't go AFTER a roller derby bout...go BEFORE!",

I know I know, call it weird, but at least I'm consistent. Earl's had all different types of chocolates, cheeses, and wines available. There's a pretty sizeable dining area inside if you want to sit down and eat right there for lunch/dinner. I had a hard time deciding which desserts to indulge and the staff at the bakery was honestly helpful. They didn't hit me with the \"everything's good here,\" they actually made solid recommendations. And OMG the s'mores pie was AMAZING!!

I was about to head over to 7th Street Public Market for some coffee, but I saw that this place had coffee too so I came in to check it out.   Earl's Grocery caters to your many needs. It is a bakery and a coffee bar; it has prepared foods and an assortment of cheeses and wine. The bakery goods really caught my attention. Some of their desserts included BOOZY brown sugar creme brulee, push cake pops, pumpkin cheesecakes, cream cheese brownies and more! For someone who isn't the biggest fan of sweets, I was definitely intrigued by their selection. I can't say that their dessert was to die for, but they were pretty good. I recommend the pumpkin cheesecake because it doesn't taste artificial and it isn't too sweet.   They also have a unique selection of chocolates. While they are a little pricey, these are flavors that you can't really find in a regular market *(maybe TJ's). As far as the interior of the establishment, it looks like regular seating for a restaurant, but they have an ample amount of outlets for you to do work or charge your phone like me. They also have an assortment of board games which is a great touch. I'll definitely be coming back here to hang out in the future.",

It's a grocery store and a coffee shop and a cheese shop and a wine shop and a deli and a place for food... and snacks that can't help but be placed in the \"odds and ends\" category. Hipster Alert.   LOCATION Next to viva chicken, down the street from CPCC. Parking is ample across the street and near the back of the entire rail line (look behind the mexican restaurant)  AMBIANCE Remember what we said earlier? It's a hodgepodge of things.. but think hipster-ized. The garage door-style windows are great in the warmer months. The windows open up and let in fresh air... which is great particularly if you're in the mood for an outdoorsy brunch.   FOOD They sell beer here. They sell weird snacks here. They sell pretty good coffee. .... but the best thing here.. is their hipster food. Their food may be labeled a certain way, but Earl's Grocery offers a twist to everything. For example, their bahn mi is not traditional bahn mi. Don't go there expecting to get a traditional Vietnamese sandwich.   If you like things that are pungent but fantastically delicious - try their Warm Bowl... turkey meatballs with Kimchi collard greens over crispy rice. Add an over easy egg. Don't ask questions.. just do it.   We recently discovered their steak tacos...pretty delicious as well. Be forewarned, the pickled onions will stay on your palate forever. It's the True test of love between you and your significant other. Seriously, our breath smelled like onions even after a load of Listerine.",

I am here today to let you in on a very important and top secret life hack. The prepared food section. I used to marinate chicken, cook it, and slice it up to add to salads, wraps, etc for lunches throughout the week. Since I have discovered the spicy chicken skewers that they sell - not sure if that's the proper name - it really has changed my entire life! Is that dramatic? No. They are cheap (2-3 skewers will run you $8), the chicken is way better than anything I've ever made, and it comes with this AMAZING jalepeno crema on the side. I don't know (nor do I want to know) what's in that sauce but it is so good. I never want to go back to cooking my own chicken. I can't and I won't.",

The coffee is really great as well, they can make pretty much any type of specialty coffee you like. They also make healthy juices if you're looking for it.

We also walked around and grabbed the little containers of deli sides which were priced $1-3. The cilantro jalapeno pasta salad was creamy and reminiscent of Cabo fish taco's avocado pasta salad. We also grabbed the basil potato salad and the lemon orzo.   Earl's has a has a cool selection of craft beer and ice cream. I have to admit, $12 for a pint of ice cream is a little crazy tho. My favorite items included the hot fried or rotisserie chicken plates with white BBQ sauce. Had to grab a salted caramel blondie from their little coffee house at $3. Not bad for the size.

Earl's Grocery is chalk full of fancy products; whether you're in the mood for a soda, beer, cheese or meat plate, full on meal or just snacking foods, they've got you covered. I love their fancy bottled sodas, quiet atmosphere and friendly staff. Although they weren't opened on my visit, I spied a couple huge garage doors that when opened would allow a nice breeze.   Whether you're into specialty products or just looking for a place to meet up with a friend, this is a sweet spot in Charlotte. I also admired their cocktail accessory area, full of bloody mary mixes and bitters (includes Raleigh's local Crude Bitters!). Earl's meets a variety of needs and if I lived locally, I would definitely hit them up for social settings more often. It's like a better version of Durham/Chapel Hill's Foster's Market [much, much better--although definitely just as pricy!]",

Once their doors opened, we all went in.  I checked out their menu and decided to have a basic breakfast sandwich and a coffee.  They gave me my coffee and a number and within a few min my sandwich was delivered to my table.   It was very good... Fried egg, bacon and cheese on wheat bread all grilled together.  It was good but after seeing some of the other creations others got, I wish I had gotten the breakfast biscuit.  It just looked really good!    I spent some time looking around the store.  There were many interesting deli type foods to buy.  I liked their assortments of cheeses, beers, and bar bitters.  Not sure when I will be back to Charlotte but I will have to make Earls a stop if I do. Enjoy!  Atmosphere = 7  Service = 8  Food = 9",

    "text": "Elizabeth Avenue has really become quite the foodie destination in Charlotte.   Earl's Grocery is several things. Bakery, coffee bar, place to grab breakfast-lunch-dinner, prepared foods, wine and cheese shop, and specialty beverages you can't find in other places.   My current obsession here is the pork ramen. It's delicious. I also like the dog of the day and the kimchi collard greens. To be honest, I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've had here except the Banh Mi. I have to agree with others on this one. I found it to be greasy and hard to eat. I actually ended up throwing most of mine away, which is not something I ever do. So far, that's the only miss on the menu for me.   How it works: grab a drink from the coolers and then go up to the kitchen counter to place you order. That way you can pay for everything together and then go sit down to wait for your food. Make sure you pay attention to prices on the drinks. There are some that are a little much. Nothing worse than buying a $6 coconut water by mistake. My last visit here the girl at the counter pointed out how much a drink was. Life saver. My friend immediately swapped it out for something else. Everyone who works here is so nice.   On top of the tables and chairs, they also have a bar like counter. It is perfect if you're looking to get out of your house and get some work done. Earl's opens up the big windows on nice days.  Important note: Earl's Grocery is open until 8:30pm on week night, but the grill/kitchen does close at 8pm.   Parking: street (free after 6pm) or in the lot across the way. The trolley thing will be coming through here at some point when they get it done. However, every time I'm in this area all I can do is think, \"who the hell is going to ride this thing?\" Oh well, that's an issue for another day.",

    "text": "We were headed to Viva Chicken for lunch but they were closed for kitchen improvements so it was fortunate for Earl's and for our tummies. I've been wanting to go here anyway from all the reviews and pics I had seen. It was packed when we walked in with a small line to order at the back counter. As you make your make to the  register to order, grab a drink cause you'll need to pay for that when you place your order. Lots of drink choices plus they have a free water dispenser up front with small cups.   Check out the cool menu and the special board to the right. Lots of daily specials. I went with the steak taco special with an avocado crema. It had onions and a large helping up tasty grilled steak and avocados. I ordered two for about $5 each. I was satisfied with two though I certainly could have nailed a third if it was dinner, or just because.   We also treated ourselves to dessert from the front counter after as they looked great. The cream cheese brownie was good but not as good as the caramel nut bar. (We shared). The desserts are petite and priced appropriately. They were also super cold and they probably would have been better 15 minutes  later out of the case. Maybe get them to go.",

The store part as per made food items, an assortment of drinks, and a small charcuterie bar. You go to the up to the counter to order and then they bring the food out to you. I tried the Korean chicken and waffles and it came with a side salad, it was delicious the syrup had a little spicy kick to it that I really enjoyed. The dressing on the salad was very lite and flavorful. They staff seemed friendly and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back.",

You can order a glass of wine from them, or buy a bottle and drink it there. The ambiance is nice like a good Whole Foods, (not like any locations in Charlotte). Healthy, quick, quality food and amazing staff. I appreciate the sell by dates on the already prepared food so you know how long it's been ready, or how much longer it has if you're getting it to go. The only down side is the hours! 8:30 PM is just not late enough for us workaholics! We need you open til 9:30 at least! :)",

Earl's is an awesome place if you're looking for a laid back atmosphere, some good food, friendly folks and an expensive to go bag full of delicious cheeses.  I heart good cheeses.   I've been a few times with friends, and we've done everything from coffee, to charcuterie trays, bottles or bubbly, bahn mi and chicken salad sandwiches, duck confit, grit bowls...So. Many. Choices!!  And all really good. Their lattes are legit (good quality beans, not over roasted), so I recommend making a day of it, start with coffee and move your way through some meals.  You may graze until you're super uncomfortable but still unable to resist grabbing some chicken salad or the Moroccan cauliflower side to go.  I really love and hate this place for that.  Be warned, it can get pretty pricey when you add all those little yummy things up, but you could go for breakfast or lunch and stay around $15-$20 including tip/beverage.    Would happily bring the parents, my friends with their babies, and also have awesome Sunday funday with girlfriends. Earl's is definitely a one stop spot.",

You don't feel like going to a restaurant where you have to fight it out for a table, but you would like to sit down and have a good quality bite to eat.  Earl's Grocery is the place for you.  Earl's has everything you need for any meal of the day...they have coffee and breakfast sandwiches for the morning, sandwiches/salads for lunch and rotisserie chicken and sides for dinner.  Now these food items aren't your normal get-this-at-any-grocery-store kind of items.  They use an interesting combination of flavors and super fresh ingredients.  They also have a nice drink selection if you're looking to relax with a beverage.  The prepared sides looked fantastic, and the orzo was very tasty.  Salad was extremely fresh and had some nice toppings.  I saw a whole mix of people during lunchtime on a Saturday.  You had people having a cup of coffee and studying on their laptops, you had small groups of friends dining at the larger tables, you had parents in their with their kids after a game.  I liked this because it made me feel like I could come here by myself and just have \"me time\" and not feel like I wish I was sitting with someone.  Two negatives on this place.  1. it's a bit pricey.  2. good luck finding a parking space.  I am 100% coming back here to grab stuff for a picnic at some point this summer.  Cheese, wine, sandwiches, salads, sides...the toughest part about planning my next outing will be deciding what food/drinks to bring from Earl's Grocery.",

    "text": "As a number of other reviewer's have mentioned, one of the great things about Earl's is the variety. You can grab coffee, alcoholic drinks, prepaid meals, hot meals, or just dessert depending on what you want at that time.  With that said, my girlfriend and I stopped in for our first visit today and both ordered hot meals to eat-in. I ordered the number 6, a beet hash with duck confit, two eggs, and cole slaw. My girlfriend chose the korean fried chicken biscuit. Both of these meals were very tasty but had small letdowns that keep me from giving Earl's a 5 star review. The No. 6 was excellent - especially the duck confit. My main complaint is that I feel it lacked a bread/starch component. The cole slaw and runny egg led to a pretty saucy plate and the beets and moist duck confit added to this. I feel like this dish may have been better as a sandwich or tacos instead of a beet hash. Also, be warned - it is spicy. You won't notice it at first, but by the time you finish the dish, you'll be feeling the heat.  My girlfriend's Korean chicken biscuit was tasty but pretty small and lacking a side. The chicken reminded me of a more Korean, milder version of Nashville hot chicken and was really good. The piece of chicken was too small for the biscuit though, and the whole thing wasn't large enough to be all that filling or worth $8-9 without a side.  All in all, the food was solid, and the servers were very friendly. Despite a few small drawbacks, I think we'll be back to at least try some other options.",

The side of the day (tabouli) desperately needed seasoning...and I am a notorious under-seasoner (if that's a word).   For a $12 price point you can eat  a lunch-sized sandwich most anywhere in Charlotte (even higher-end places) and this one wasn't very impressive. I may give something else a shot because everyone deserves a second chance.",

Grain bowl was really wet with water (?) Fried Rice with tempeh all same flavored (savory) over salted and a bit of a mush. Was looking forward to pickles and kimchi Popping out at me with tangy vinegar vibes but they blended as salty with everything else. Mediterranean salad was good and chicken salad sandwich was fine. Will come back again and try again! Staff was so great and there are lots of options. I'm sure we'll find our groove!",

What I bought for $8.99 was dried pulled pork on an undercooked hoagie roll (not a baguette) soggy with a bizarre mayo. The Charcuterie was \"pre wrapped\" where the cheese and additions are mushy and dried. The $11 noodle bowl was an upcharge for 2 small pieces of chewy dried pork belly on honestly cheap asian store rice noodles.",

Their chai almond milk latte is the best in Charlotte! I find myself craving a visit to Earl's. The breakfast wrap is good if you like a more huevos rancheros flavor. This place also as amazing food to go. We had their pork tenderloin skewers for dinner one night that were savory spicy and excellent cut of meat, very tender and delicious. Also love the dairy free \"ice cream\" salted caramel chocolate! Yummy!",

The cabbage was just pickled cabbage. For 6 bucks I thought I'd get two tacos per order, nope just 1. I also ordered the salmon taco, same sad little thing 4, 1/4 inch thin, dime and quarter size pieces of fish, 6 bucks for 1 taco.  I ordered the watermelon and tomato gazpacho, thinking I'm getting 4 tacos, I'll get the small size, like 8oz.  Nothing to write home about, $5. I see plenty of rave reviews for this place so, maybe it's me.  I just don't think that after dropping 18 bucks on 2 tacos, a teacup portion of soup and a bottle of root beer, I should have to stop at a burger joint to get full.",

If you want McDonald's style quality for McDonald's style prices, don't come here.  Earl's is high quality and you pay for it. I don't mind because I know this place is legit and worth every penny.   This place was full of college students (mostly) on a Tuesday morning at 9:30. The staff at the front was so helpful...and good looking! ;). I felt like I was in New York City!  Thanks Earl!",

The flavors all worked well together, and the chipotle hummus wasn't too spicy - had just the right amount of zing for someone who doesn't often eat spicy food.   The included side of pasta salad was a bit smaller than I'd like - I needed about four or five more bites, but it was a nice compliment to the sandwich.   Good selection of beverages, but only offering $1.50+ bottles of water wasn't my favorite. I'm just fine with a good ol' glass of city punch out of the faucet.   That sandwich though - I'll be going back... but probably for take-out.",

There are a number of specialty items sprinkled throughout the store, some of which you cannot find in your local grocery store. The dining area offers plenty of space for those who choose to dine in. Outside seating is also an option.

    "text": "So this place is lovely. I absolutely love the boutique grocery stores that seem to be popping in around the Charlotte area.  We used to be limited to going to Common Market to get the very unique and eclectic vibe but Earl's has a bit more of an organized chic feel to it.  Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area we have a good deal more to choose from so I'm very glad to feel almost at home sitting at one of their tables I. The dining area.    When you walk in you'll notice a coffee/pastry bar to your left and they normally welcome people with bright smiles which of course is always nice.  The deli lunch bar has an array of choices ranging from delicious burgers to even tasty noodle bowls. I'm a fan.    If you walk through the aisles you'll notice a plethora of unique goodies everywhere so be sure to give that a look as well.  This is one of the best places o feel to have lunch with friends or even stop in to get some work done on your laptop.  Cheers!",

    "text": "I usually like to wait to write reviews until I have a really good handle on the menu and try numerous things, but Earl's has so much it's going to take forever to get to that point, so I'll just proceed. First, Earl's is a spacious, clean, upscale, minimalist place that is perhaps misnamed. I would have called it Earl's Provisions, but they didn't call me for branding advice. Anyway it's probably not going to be somewhere you would ever go for a week's ingredients. However it *would* be somewhere you would go for getting something special if you're having people over or want something different. Their prepared food section has tons of unique side dishes and they have a wonderful pickle bar (wish it was even bigger!) for appetizer/antipasto type of goodness.   As others mentioned, the also have a deli counter that in addition to sandwiches also have a \"warm bowl\" of fried rice with turkey meatballs (delish), and *cold* noodle bowl with mild chile lime tofu and the most wonderful picked cabbage. [ I did note to the manager I thought the noodles should be warm as well because they're really cold. ] I've not tried the breakfast, but I definitely will. Their coffee counter and juice counter is always staffed by the most enthusiastic friendly women (and unlike the lady with the bad experience, when I didn't care for something, the manager apologized profusely and immediately gave me something else and comped me). They have almond milk at the coffeebar which is appreciated and the juices are delicious. I highly recommend the Earl's refresher!  As others mentioned, they also have all kinds of gourmet treats, charcuterie, fromage and drinks, so it's a perfect place to assemble a gift basket (or just a gift!)  In addition, it's a quiet, spacious place with lots of seating (and free Wifi) so for me it's a fantastic place for a coffee meeting. It's kind of the \"not so common\" market.   I hope they consider opening a 2nd location!",

They also have special events from time to time, including beer tastings and cocktail classes. They just started Sunday brunches.   The upscale item selection is pretty astounding (10+ kinds of bitters), but isn't really what keeps me coming back. It is the friendly service, affordable sandwiches and salads and great drink selections at retail prices that can be consumed on site.   Looking forward to stopping here even more once the streetcar opens in July. Hopefully it cools down enough for them to open their garage doors again!  Hope they extend their hours a bit more in the evenings and mornings. 7 AM - 9 PM please. :-)  Cheers!",

My  guess  is that they are trying to be different,  the result was a minuscule portion of beet gulash and a teaspoon of duck with a fried egg on top...maybe a slight bit larger than side serving. So as to not disappoint  my friend I kept  my opinion to myself. As for My daughter's  breakfast BLT ,I notice she was having a hard time with  it. I figured it was the fried green  tomatoes putting  her off , so still being hungry I thought  I would help  her out. It was then that I realized  that I could not eat them either. Being from the South  I guess  my expectations  were higher , but these were unedible, so 3 entrees and 2 teas and a drink for $45.00 later....... I like funky foods but they at least need to taste good and be of reasonable value.",

My husband and parents both got the breakfast wrap/burrito, which they enjoyed. I got the bagel with smoked salmon and an egg. I liked that my bagel came with salad on the side, but I thought the extra slaw they put on the top was a bit too much. It was as if they were trying a bit too hard. I would not let that one thing take away from the whole place though. I love the atmosphere and the different fresh and made to order options. It's a bit pricey, but that's not surprising for the atmosphere they present. My parents both got loose leaf tea and really enjoyed theirs. They have an excellent selection of teas. I also saw that they do catering and think from this sampling that they would do an excellent job.  We were going hiking so we weren't drinking, but I did get my eyes on one of their bloody Marys and they looked delicious! If we're ever doing Sunday Funday, I'll be back for one of those for sure.

There are different sections where you can order food and then they will bring it to your table. Not unless you are getting coffee, make sure you get your drink first, and your silverware and napkins.   We ordered the Korean chicken and waffles. It was very good, and it came with a small salad on the side. We also had the Banh Mi sandwich. It was also good. I am not a fan of pulled pork and that's the only option. I pulled off some of the meat because it was too much for my taste. Otherwise, it was good.   They have a bakery section with cookies and pastries and pies. My other half went for coffee and came back with the S'mores pie. WHY?!?! It was good, just too much chocolate for my taste. Overall, we will likely be back.",

I yelped best places to study and this place came up. The reviews were solid so I headed there. I parked across the street and it was a breeze.  There were a few college students doing homework when I came in but the place was pretty empty. I placed my order and headed to the restroom. The restroom simply didn't fit with the space, it seemed like it belonged to a totally different facility. It wasn't immaculate and was kind of scary with flickering lights. Reminded me of something from a scene of saw. Positive of the restroom was the push door instead of a handle which is a pet peeve of mines. I had to get out of there! Once I walked out, cool...back in a nice serene environment  By the time I finished my order (turkey sandwich) was done. I had to walk past the counter so I grabbed it, found a table, plugged in and made it my personal space for 2.5 hours. I was comfortable and loved the scenery. Nice music played through the speakers which added to the ambiance but I pretty much zoned it out. At around 5:30 I started gathering my things to head out. At this time people where coming in and ordering wine and food. I would definitely like to come back in the evening and check the vibes. I loved everything about the place except the restroom. LOL. I will be back.",

The sour daikon and carrot pickles along with the cilantro and aioli paired perfectly. It was so filling I was full after half but decided to finish it since the bread was getting soggy, not good leftover material. I was almost tempted to order one of the daily specials written on a chalkboard beside the counter and need to come back for those.  If you dine inside there are tables and a charging station inside. There are tables outside also. They will give you a number and bring the food out to you. I was in a hurry, so I ordered my food to go. Your name will be called when it is ready and they box and bag your food super conveniently. While I was waiting, I wandered around the store looking at the gourmet chocolates and candy they had on display. There are also salads, small sides, and dessert options boxed up. And a coffee bar. Also, a good selection of wine and craft beer. This place has everything.  Parking can be tricky during peak times - there are a few spots along the street right outside but not too many.",

The only synopsis I'm able to give is it's Dean and Deluca's meets Not Just Coffee meets Amelie's.   Earl's has the diversity of D&C, the comfort and skillful brewing of Not Just Coffee and the enticing sweet treats of Amelie's. I would recommend the Ramen as the best in Charlotte, but the size is equivalent to a small bowl of side soup. I was expecting the giant bowl that I typically receive at Ramen places and simply wanted MORE! I found satiation in the warm comfort of a Chai Tea Latte, which melted in my mouth and was the best complement to a breezy Fall day; and ended my meal with a lemon bar to go (of course) that kept me happy for the rest of the afternoon.",

Pick one. Charcuterie? That too. What about a filling meal? That's also covered. Seriously, it's a one stop for the finicky eaters. I also love the selection of adult beverages as well as fun choices for sodas, juices, and waters.  I may be mildly obsessed with the lamb burger. Perfectly cooked, and the toppings add to the flavor profile. The black bean burger is also very tasty. Try the peanut butter mousse pie. Outstanding.  Also, Charlotte's best ice cream just might be found at Earl's and it comes in a pint. Yes, they carry Jeni's! I've been looking for someone who carried that brand of ice cream for awhile now, and I've finally found it. Get the goat cheese with red cherries. You'll thank me later.",

For instance, just discovered they carry two flavors of Roots humus (coconut curry & mango siracha) that I used to bring back in bulk every time I went to Asheville because I could never find them in Charlotte. Their cheese selection is rivaled only by Orman's at 7th Street (but that requires a trip uptown). They have a lot of great deli items like premade sides, salads, rotisserie chicken, etc. you couldn't do ALL your grocery shopping here, but it makes great additions to and spices up your regular staples.   Now, let's talk about their food counter... Their daily specials are all to die for. Even their every day menu items are so, so good. I always have a hard time deciding what to get. A friend got their dog of day today with an all beef Nathan's hot dog, spicy peanut sauce, kimchi and jalapeno bacon. How good does that sound?!? I had the warm bowl -- one of my faves, especially on a cool day when you want some warm, comfort food -- with fried rice, kimchi collards and turkey meatballs. Be adventurous here. Get something that sounds a little wacky. You won't be disappointed! And, for the love, SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT!",

I agree with the user who mentioned it is kind of like mixing Dean and Deluca with Common Market.   I had a breakfast biscuit which was really good and my dad had the turkey sandwich. He said it was awesome and he is a tough critic. They have a great selection of various sundries that are super unique and often local. They have a ton of different sodas which is always fun.

So if you didn't get it from the name it is a grocery store that has a pretty decent line up of food.  If you are looking for a low key weekend brunch place this is it! Order at the counter in the back but don't forget to decide on what you want to drink from the barista (at the front register) so you can order your food and beverages together in one order.  I got their breakfast tacos which come one per order and you can get them with flour or corn tortillas which I was super happy about since I think flour tortillas are just wrong! I got one taco and one of their amazing cinnamon rolls. Get a cinnamon roll if they have them you will not regret it.  We would have totally made it out of the place having one of the cheapest brunches ever if we had not been lured into the grocery side of it. They had Jenni's ice cream which is a pretty big deal and very hard to find along with a few other exciting items that ended up coming home with us.  I wish we had tried this place sooner:)",

    "text": "Attention business owners: Never underestimate the power of Yelp! After doing a few errands in the Cotswold neighborhood and needing some fuel, I searched \"Lunch\" on the 'ol Yelp App and checked out the bounty of options. A couple spots down the list I saw Earl's Grocery in the Elizabeth neighborhood, followed by raving reviews by several of my friends like Peter, Sheree, Christina, and more! So sure enough, this influence got me to leave Cotswold and run down to Earl's in Elizabeth without ever having tried it before...  ...and what a good decision it was! I'll be honest, Elizabeth is probably the area I know the least about in Charlotte despite being only a couple of miles away from my native NoDa 'hood. Besides the fact that the Streetcar runs thru here and CPCC students dominate the crosswalks, not much else comes to mind. What a shame on my part, all the past dining experiences in this area are such great memories. I'll start to work on familiarizing myself with this side of the QC ASAP.  The name itself, \"Earl's Grocery,\" may be a bit misleading. While they do have a limited selection of non-perishable goods and an extensive deli, cheese, charcuterie products, there's not much more to the retail foods section. The wine corner is darling with many quality brands in every type of wine you would think of. No, the real feature of Earl's isn't the \"Grocery,\" it's the menu!  The menu is loud, in your face, and has a lot of different cuisine offerings that are sure to have something for everybody. Something about the mysterious title \"The No. 6 Bowl\" caught my eye and I was even more intrigued about the description: Duck Confit, Beets, Slaw, Eggs and a \"TKO\" Sauce. Any place that's bold enough to put Duck Confit on the lunch menu has my attention, sign me up! It arrived at my table in a cool metal bowl in kind of a stacked fashion. First bite, succulent duck with plenty of luscious, delicious fat. Stay with me, yes I'm describing food here. This fat melded well with the crisp tartness of the slaw, which segued kindly into the delicate earthiness of the beets. A shade of spicy heat from the sauce enhanced the harmony even more. I'm finding tons of dishes with this masterful balance of flavor all over Charlotte and I'm glad to say that Earl's delivered yet another SLAM DUCK (see what I did there)!  Couldn't resist getting a small sweet bite. Over by the coffee bar is a diverse range of different pastries, brownies, cakes and pies. The cream  cheese brownie looked amazing and I wasn't disappointed. The brownie was a bit too dense and left a bit to be desired texture-wise, but the flavors were spot on. The cheesecake-like top had a nice browned finish and was as much velvety as it was delicious. A perfect, satisfying end to lunch.  Looks like Earl's is yet another enticing reason to visit Elizabeth early and often.",

They have various sections inside the small, hipster-friendly grocery store for baked goods/ coffee/cocktails, cheese and charcuterie, frozen items in the case, wine section, bartenders shelf with several bitters and many other accessories, and various other shelves with local and regional products.    I picked up one of my favorite root beers (they have about 8-10 to choose from in the cold case), a fudge brownie and a Cocktail Kingdom fruit peeler.  Service is friendly, ample seating up front by the street.  They do ask you to move to the benches along wall or glass front during lunchtime if you're just hibernating in front of your laptop.  There are 2 entrances, one along front sidewalk, one in the rear by the restrooms, leading to the parking lot.  Yes, some of their items are pricey, like the gourmet pints of ice cream which range from $8-13 for the most part.",

This is my go-to stop after I land in Charlotte after being on the road for a week-plus, because, simply put, I can get a little bit of everything, since I have the weirdest cravings when I land, and my fridge is always pathetically empty, and one must fuel up before actually heading to the grocery store, if the energy is there.  Great wine selection, cheeses are actually, really well-priced...great accompaniments.  Awesome telework space with plenty of outlets and of course, coffee. Not the best for phone calls because it gets real loud but if you need some good energy and vibes and can't deal with the quiet of your own home for too long, head to Earl's.",

There is a huge parking lot across the street and also street parking. It's rare to find a neighborhood in Charlotte this close to uptown with no parking issues.   I love coming here for brunch on the weekends and for a quick dinner on weeknights. They have quite a few vegan and vegetarian options which is a big sell for me. My go to for dinner is the grain bowl which is full of whole grains and vegetables and is super healthy. I have a harder time sticking to healthy options when I go for brunch because who can say no to pimento cheese grits??  This is a counter service restaurant so you can count on eating pretty quickly. This is also a good place to grab a coffee and bring your laptop during the less busy hours- they have a counter with outlets to charge your devices. They also have prepared foods that you could grab to take home for dinner. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a super delicious causal meal!",

I've ordered a few of their prepared foods from the register aged case and have always found everything to be fresh and well made. Prices are fair. My favorite thing about this place though is their food menu made to order. I pretty much always order the harvest salad which has roasted beets, farro, and other yummy toppings in addition to a citrus vinaigrette.   You can take the free trolley from uptown or they have their own parking lot across the street. Street parking may also be an option. I've also never had a problem getting a seat in here. It's definitely worth a visit if you've never been!",

    "text": "Interesting menu and selection of Cheeses and Meats  My wife had Cataract Surgery and we had to drive down to Cotswold for the Post Op follow-up Surgery turned out great and while we were down, since we are not normally in Charlotte mid-week early, this afforded us the opportunity to give Earl's a try.  Been on my list of places I wanted to try and finally got a chance.  At 10 am, not much trouble finding a parking spot and at the same time, the street car runs right in front of it.  Walked and took a minute to figure out the routine but after that, everything went smoothly.  You go to the second counter to place your order and that is also where the large menu board is as well.  My wife had already decided based on the one line menu that she wanted the Breakfast Biscuit which is a home made scratch biscuit available several different ways. She chose the Ham, Brie and Apricot Jam and I must say, it was appealing. She indicated that it tasted as good as it looked.  I went with the  Rustic Egg Sandwich which was eggs, Swiss Chhese Mustard and Grilled Whole Wheat to which I added Bacon.  Excellent indeed.  The coffee was excellent as well. A nice rich dark roast full of flavor and very fresh and hot.  While we waited for our Breakfast, both of us took time to look through the store at the various provisions they offer.  I was very impressed with the great selection of Cheeses on hand.  If we were going straight home, I probably would have bought some to take home.  Nice and clean and the staff is very professional and friendly.  Definitely a place I will make a point of going again if only to try the lunch menu.  On the Holiday Menu, there is a Turkey I am looking at for Thanksgiving that looks interesting.",

A nice market of interesting and unique micro products to browse while waiting for your fresh sandwich to be prepared and a huge cooler of different and unique drinks, plus a number of local micro brews if you're so inclined.  I had the \"Back Porch BLT\" today and was seriously impressed. Jalapeno bacon, pimento cheese, fried green tomato pickle, lettuce, Duke's mayo on grilled sourdough. Terrific crunchy texture, perfect bacon and a lovely firm sourdough. Perfect sandwich, absolutely.  Definitely need to get back to Earl's. I can completely see why this is one of the Top 100 on Yelp in Charlotte. Awesome.",

The salad was huge and was comprised of raw kale, beets, pickled onions, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and sliced avocado. Very satisfying and very healthy.  The burger was nicely prepared all the way down to the buttered and toasted bun. Of course we couldn't leave without dessert and a coffee. The gluten free brownie, ginger cookie and latte were all superb.  Menu is eclectic mix including such options as soft tacos, sandwiches, and even, Banh Mi. Service was adequate and sanitary rating was an exceptional 98. Ample seating is located in front and back, and out front along sidewalk Nothing really blew us away but, based on the other Yelp reviews alone, I'd say it's definitely worth a try. If we lived closer, we'd probably try it again.",

You can sit, eat, drink, and chat at Earl's for a couple hours or more. I enjoy visiting to peruse the menu and to enjoy the monthly spirits event with Bob Peters. I must remind myself not to eat before arriving so that I can personally delve into the menu. Service is great. Staff members are helpful and knowledgeable. Your experience will be grand!",

Our favorite thing to do is to pick 3 or 4 dishes from the case to share for dinner! You can order the dishes in a variety of container sizes, depending on what size crowd you're feeding.  We've also eaten off their made-to-order menu, and I've been similarly impressed! Goose really loves their tacos, so I'll plug them here.

A foursome a few tables over we're sharing a bottle of wine, and two young families next to us were also grabbing a late lunch. I had the chicken salad wrap with was delicious with the grapes, ample greens, and large chunks of walnuts. A bit pricey for just a wrap ($7.99, no drink or side), but I'm not complaining too much.

    "text": "I had super high hopes after reading so many great reviews of Earl's Grocery. My husband and I came here for lunch on a recent weekday. We easily found parking, which was nice. In general, the service wasn't great and no one was super friendly. In fact, when we went to order, my husband greeted the employee by saying \"Hey. How are you?\" The employee mumbled back \"good\" and then stared at us to signal that he was waiting to take our order.   I ordered the Poke Bowl and he ordered the Grilled Pimento Cheese sandwich. We also shared a slice of apple pie. The breakdown:  Poke Bowl - it arrived steaming. That's right, steaming! The rice was piping hot which in turn, heated the entire dish. I didn't love that. Plus, there was no seaweed as advertised but instead there was a ton of lettuce. I was, overall, unimpressed and didn't eat all of it.  Pimento Cheese Sandwich - my husband loves grilled pimento cheese sandwiches! If it (or fried chicken) is on the menu, it's an automatic for him. He liked the tomatoes on this sandwich and the amount of pimento cheese, however the bread was too thin for the heft of the sandwich and it all kind of fell apart after his first bite. He said he liked the sandwich, but agreed that the bread should've been sturdier.  Apple Pie - tasty but unmemorable. I asked if we could get it warmed up and was told \"it is refrigerated\". We both agreed that it would have been better warmer.   I want to love this place and we agreed that we would give it another try, but would definitely order different items.",

First, it's s coffee shop.  The first station near the left front entrance is where you can Ofer coffee, tea and associated drinks as well as pastries and the like. Deeper inside there is another station where you can order gourmet sandwiches (mainly hot) and pay for them. There are plenty of tables and stations where you can eat at or take it to go. In the center is a third station with all sorts of gourmet meals and sides.  I particularly like their risotto cakes and duck confit.  My father enjoyed salmon with a side of super salad.  If you want to eat at the restaurant they will heat it up for you.  It seems like more people get it to go though.  The people working there are very nice but it is kind of inconvenient that you need to pay for these items at either of the two previously mentioned stations.  This is also a cheese store with a vast variety of cheeses and charcuterie and they will make platters for you if you request in advance.  There are refrigerated coolers around with s large variety of specialty sodas, beers, lemonade and other juices. There are also a few display areas with ore measured salads and sides and a few  other items spread throughout the establishment. The prices are high but so is the quality!",

It's a one stop shop for any of your specialty grocery/food needs. Once I came here for a certain Jewish pastry and they had it. I would truly rely on this place to help curate a dynamite charcuterie platter to impress friends/family for the holiday season.  Speaking of holiday, they are now taking orders for any of your Thanksgiving needs until November 20th. Furthermore, they sell cartons of Jeni's ice cream but they're sold a HIGH premium - this is your warning. You can also pick up greeting cards based on occasion.  They have indoor and outdoor seating that make it a great spot as a solo work spot or casual coffee date. A quick note about their coffee: it's GOOD. Seriously, order yourself a cup and sip slowly.  The designated parking lot is located directly across the street and I've always found a spot. If the lot is full, street parking is also available.",

I've never actually shopped there for groceries or food to cook later, as I don't live in the area, but we've gone twice for a weekend lunch when we wanted to do something a little healthier.   This place is mostly counter service, but it has plenty of tables to sit at. There's always a nice energy to the place...it can be a bit loud and chaotic when full, but the vibes are still good. I had a chicken salad wrap on my most recent visit. The chicken was flavorful, and the Dijon sauce paired really well with it. You can even get breakfast cocktails, if you're so inclined (mostly basic fare like Bloody Marys and mimosas). The servers are also very accommodating if you want to do something like get your sandwich on a sad bed of greens rather than the DELICIOUS BREAD it rightfully should be on. But we all understand. New year, new you.   I will say that you should probably sit on the picnic-style benches with caution. On my last visit, I accidentally launched another person into the air when I stood up because of the angle where he was sitting on the other side. Not my finest moment, and definitely a sign that I should probably be asking for that bed of greens instead of the aforementioned delicious bread. Regardless, I'll be returning to Earl's in the future...and hoping I don't run into that guy or catapult him into the air again.",

Loved the quality and was a good size. I think it had bread n butter pickles on it. Yum. Got some Sweet Onion chips too. But the atmosphere is great. Just ate and people watched. Hope to get back soon.",

    "text": "This cute cafe (from the owners of Carpe Diem Restaurant a few doors down) also serves as an artisanal market. Great place to pop in for coffee, eat breakfast or lunch, or do some local food shopping!   The prepared breakfast and lunch items can be hit or miss. The egg biscuit is always a safe and tasty one, as well as their French toast, grilled cheeses, and tomato soup (very flavorful). I've seen people get the salads, which look like they're a good size, but i have not tried one yet. The desserts and pastries here are very tasty! The s'mores pie is a classic favorite, of course -- with the toasted marshmallow on top.  I love their commitment to unique food items. Besides their pre-prepared side items, entrees, and to-go sandwiches, you can get unique things like roasted coffee from Charlotte, Rosemary crackers made in Asheville, a package of Cali's Hot Little Biscuits from Charleston, spicy honey from Durham, etc. The possibilities here are enormous for such a small restaurant/market.   Another one of my favorite things about them is their cheese selection. There's a huge selection of near and far cheeses that are great for making your own charcuterie board! If they make it for you it can be a little pricey, so don't be afraid to get creative on your own!  Pro tip: Space inside is limited, so be careful going during peak times.",

It's a small, modern looking place with great energy. I was there at 1:30 and the place was packed. This is always a good sign. I will agree with previous reviews, the place  is like a Dean and Deluca or Reids, trendy and pricey.   I was told to order the Banh Mi. No objects there. Vietnamese food is my absolute favorite!  Sadly for me Earl's version of the Banh Mi sandwich missed the mark. What a bummer considering I paid $9 for one sandwich.  The sandwich itself  was very pretty to look at but the taste was not a True Banh Mi. The pulled pork was OK, It's infused with lemon grass and  it had an odd taste. The veggies were a big disappointment, they were not pickled and I only got 3 very thinly sliced radishes. They were sliced so thin, there was no way they were going to give me that  necessary crunch I so desired. The bread was the star, a crispy baguette with a chewy center. It was perfection! Can I buy the baguette alone? If so I will be there daily! The sandwich was also very wet! TIP...get extra napkins and a bib. The \"side\"of the day was this noodle spicy coleslaw concoction that offered nice heat but was WAY over dressed.",

Although the duck dish was listed under sandwiches there was no bread involved. After getting over that initial disappointment, he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. Bahn mi also came with tasty pasta salad. Fantastic portion size for the price. I definitely am already trying to figure out how to go back. In warm weather area is also nice to walk around in after eating.",

This is a really great addition and has a great vibe. In here youll see lots of hard-to-find items from cheeses to meats to snacks, a salad bar, coffee, desserts, decent selection of wine and some craft beer as well as lots of interesting sodas and other drinks. But lets get down to why we came, the deli. Ive never had a banh mi sandwich mind you, but authentic or not, this thing hit the spot. This tender pulled pork with carrot and daikon (no idea what it is but it was good)\"noodles\" and aoili on an artisan baguette-type roll sandwich will make you wish youd have grabbed another handful of napkins before sitting down. If loving a messy sandwich is wrong then I dont wanna be right. Anyways, go to Earl's. Great staff, great food, great atmosphere. I think youll enjoy!  PS I googled \"daikon\" mid-review, so its now officially part of my vocabulary. And apparently i like radishes.  Who knew  \\_()_/ ",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, I like new places that open near me and try to support them as much as possible. I have been to Earl's grocery on numerous occasions now. I have been to check it out when the fresh paint smell was still there. I have been for lunch, I've tried their coffee and I have been back a few times to buy specific products that I believe only they offer. Without a doubt, the best thing that they do is offer specialty products to include fancy sodas, sauces and cooking ingredients. They have a cheese and charcuterie counter, as well as meals or food ready to take home and eat, kind of like Dean and Deluca. They also have a lot of interesting stuff in the frozen section like non dairy ice cream that the wife loves and as she should because it's made with delicious coconut milk for those plagued with a lactose aversion.   That was the good part. The not so good part is the lunch options. The rice bowl was good, but not great. The banh mi sandwich was filled with dry pulled pork and less than ideal. All of which was at a premium price. Trust me, I don't mind paying for good food. In fact, people would easily tell me that I have a problem if they knew my threshold for paying for a good meal. The lunch offerings are not up to the price point in my opinion, and I am not even taking portion size into the equation. I am only taking straight up quality into consideration here. The worst part of my experiences at Earl's is by far the coffee or at least the 2 versions of americano that I have been offered. The first version was very weak in flavor and taste. The second was an exercise in confusion as the server seemed confused on the operation of the espresso machine. Only a small amount of water was added to my drink and I was offered more if I wanted, but I opted not to add anymore to see if this version was more flavorful. It was not. My service experience has been anywhere from full on exuberance to mild indifference. The most consistent service comes from the cheese lady or at least the lady that works the middle section of cheese and deli counters. Would I make a second attempt at lunch at Earl's? Definitely, but I'm seriously concerned with facing strike two and three all at once. I hope that they can turn around the weak points that I've experienced. Ultimately, the trolley project may sink them or at least they will have the perfect scapegoat.",

Their specials are written on the chalkboard and I try to grab one of those.  I do love the sandwiches, but the burgers are always great as well.  Lots of drink options and dessert choices.  Food is a bit high but not pricey.  The ambiance is great and the table space great for sitting for a bit.    One thing - their customer service and servers are clueless.  I stood in line there once for 15 minutes while 4-5 of them wandered around behind the counter or stood and looked while one cashier tried to ring up a single customer's order.  The customer just kept changing/adding to the order oblivious to the 6 people behind her.  Not sure why no one - and I mean no one - rectified the situation by opening another register.  This has happened alot, and I've heard others complain, put food back, and walk away.  Not sure when they will figure this out.",

It is never too terribly loud. It's in a prime location to walk to other eateries or hop on the trolley and continue to explore Charlotte.  Do not miss out on this gem!",

    "text": "Earl's Grocery has helped to revive this section of Elizabeth Avenue, and it's a great addition. The location is very convenient- I typically ride the streetcar from Uptown (the stop is right outside Earl's) or sometimes walk. Its quite fun to sit by the window and watch the streetcar trundle past along Elizabeth.   I like the interior and vibe of Earl's it is very welcoming. I've had coffee here before, but this was my first time eating here.   Coffee here is very hit and miss- sometimes bitter and dark. sometimes mellow and enjoyable. Lattes and cappuccinos are also inconsistent- sometimes the espresso is watery and bitter and the milk is poorly steamed- not impressive.   On to the food, the selection is very good, a lot of options. I ordered a meatball hoagie. The staff were friendly but so slow- taking their time to do basic tasks, like pressing buttons on the register. The sandwich has very big, and looked like a big mess on the plate. It was supposed to come with crusty bread- more like soggy bread. Overall the food here is meh. But it is nice to sit here and watch the world go by.",

Goodness me, how are you going to top this? If you take a stroll out of the Visulite or dinner from Customshop without waltzing in for a few high-class chocolates, a few bottles of wine, Charlotte coffee, or pasta from the coolest self-serve station I've ever seen, then you're not truly living.   Thank you to the folks who have decided to marry the conceptualizations from Dean & Deluca and Common Market. It's edgy enough to where the cool kids will find their way in for a Japanese pour over and classy (albeit clean) enough where all of the Myers Park ladies-who-lunch will stop by for a sandwich during the day. They've really hit the nail square on the head with this spot.   I'm looking forward to patronizing the coffee bar a bit more in the near future. Pretty cool to see they are supporting Charlotte roasteries with coffees from the bar and also whole bean.   Welcome to the hood, Earl. Your grocery is a fine establishment indeed.",

There's also a lot of variety - whether you want a smoothie or a salad or a big juicy burger, all of the choices are delicious.  I've never had to fight for a spot like at some other coffeeshops in town. People are great about sharing tables if they are working solo. There are outlets everywhere - a laptop user's dream!   The employees are friendly. The coffee drinks are delicious. The Earl's Refresher juice is really good. I also love the grain bowl and the grilled cheese.   I don't have a single complaint about this place. I did get a parking ticket this morning because I was a doof and spaced on the fact that there was a meter right beside my car ... but that's my own fault. So, pro tip: feed the meter!",

    "text": "New kid on the block, but what a welcome addition it is for any foodie in the QC!  Earl's Grocery is something like a little local Dean & Deluca- lots of small batch, high-end chips, dips, and other edibles along with a pretty mean selection of artisan cheeses and meats and a deli counter with some of the fanciest delved eggs to be found in the deep South.  But that's not all, there's coffee and espresso with a handful of tempting baked desserts: think cookies, cakes and pies.   There's also a small deli counter with a menu of sandwiches that go far beyond what you'd see at most any other sub shop. The pork banh mi was packed with tender meat and flavors of the veggies and sauce that melded well.  Not authentic, but plenty tasty.  A grilled cheese with hoop cheddar, arugula and picked peaches was also notable for its uniqueness and lightness, which is a good option in the warmer weather.  Pair any of those with the small but able wine or craft beer selection and it would be easy to while away an afternoon here.  No alcohol? No problem, as there are a number of waters, still, and sparkling beverages to pick up in the coolers as well.  There's a small selection of tables and chairs up front, at the windows, and the store feels quite open and spacious.    This is a fine addition to the neighborhood and it's great to have another option for picking up small provisions for parties and social gatherings.  This is the kind of place that's also dangerous to a wallet, as shopping with your eyes is bound to leave you picking up things you never knew you needed- from artisan crackers to small batch caramels to locally roasted coffee.  This is a hall of temptations and it, thus far, tastes very good!",

    "text": "I've been to Earl's 3 times and have had three different yet equally awesome experiences!  On my first Earl's experience, my husband and I decided to get drinks prior to watching a show at the nearby Visulite Theatre. We were delighted with their selection of local brews, and I literally jumped for joy that they had Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale cans selling for 2.99 a pop. All told, we both had a tall boy can of local brew and spent just over $6 -not a bad deal at all!  My second trip to Earl's was a quick drop by after a lunch appointment at Nothing But Noodles (which is delightful and located next door to Earl's) to pick up some vino for a happy hour. I was delighted with the selection, diversity, and prices of Earl's wines. I ended up buying a fabulous bubbly rose for less than $13. If I hadn't been in such a hurry, I would've picked up a few cheeses and cold cuts from the charcuterie/deli section, but alas... I am always in too much of a rush.   For my third and most recent Earl's experience, my husband and I took our in-laws to Earl's for lunch. We made lunch into an entire afternoon event by taking the streetcar and oohing and ahhing over Charlotte's beautiful uptown and the Sugar Creek Greenway. My in-laws were skeptical at first because they thought it was weird that we were having lunch at a grocery store. After I explained that it was more of a provisions store/deli, they warmed up and I got a resounding \"oh cool\" from them after we walked through the door. I ordered the harvest salad which was amazingly fresh and had a fantastic Fresno chili vinaigrette. My husband ordered a bowl of chili and had some sort of artisanal potato chips, and my in-laws split the grilled cheese sandwich (which was HUGE). We were all pleased with our selections, and since it was one of the nicest days of the year, we were delighted that Earl's has floor to ceiling windows that were opened to let the fresh air in.  Whether you're looking for a quick bite or wanting to show off Charlotte's quickly growing (and ever changing) streetcar line cuisine scene to visitors, Earl's is the place to go!",

    "text": "So this is the second trip to Earl's Grocery that I've made so far within the past couple of weeks.  I'm a total foodie so I make it to different eateries and unique little stops over Charlotte fairly frequently.  Today I stopped in at a quarter to noon and the lunch rush hadn't quite made it here yet.  Noise level is actually perfect.  I'm currently working on my laptop and I can hear the buzz of conversations but I can still work and concentrate and even make a phone call without being distracted.  This time I decided to try the Banh Mi Sandwich.  It's priced at $8.99, still a little over twice as much as the authentic Banh Mi you can get from Le's Sandwich shop at the Asian Corner Mall but they definitely made a valiant attempt.    There were Banh Mi-esque aspects to the sandwich which was accompanied with the traditional pickled daikon & carrot strips.  (I love those.)  This one had lemongrass pulled pork, radish, cilantro, mint, and was served on a toasted baguette, & a Saigon aioli.  It was definitely tasty.  Got a little soggy quickly but hey, a little mess doesn't hurt anyone.  I opted for a can of Noda Jam Session from one of the local breweries.  (Yes...it's like Common Market. You can relax with a beer here....or come with your friends for a mimosa brunch...just get a bottle of Champagne and some OJ, crack them open, and pour away...)   I still haven't been disappointed with this new little grocery/cafe/deli place.  It's situated right on Elizabeth between the hospital and CPCC's central campus.  Parking is decent during the weekdays.  It's got the usual 2 hour max parking.  If you haven't downloaded the Park Mobile app for your phone's you're missing out.  Super easy and it shoots you a text when you're running low on time.    The people here are generally really friendly and they've also got Wi-Fi if you'd like to get some work done just like I am right now.",

Warm grit bowl with fried green tomato chow chow: huge portion. Glad I added turkey meatballs or else it would have been a little bland. A+ with the addition. Chorizo would have been even better.  Duck confit hash: unique, big portion, fresh. Wish they had a little more duck and a little less beet. Otherwise fantastic.  Bahn mi: traditional bahn mi fans might not enjoy this play on the the sandwich with BBQ instead of slices.  My go to lunch or coffee spot, especially on a nice day.",

    "text": "What a great little spot added to the Elizabeth area.  I know I am a little behind on checking this place out but I am glad I was able to stop in this week.  They have a lot of great things to offer and they somewhat remind me of a cross between Dean and Deluca and Common Market.  They offer the retail priced wine, pre packed baked goods and snacks, fresh salads, sandwiches, and a full coffee bar!  Woohoo!  They offer milk subs like coconut or almond milk for your coffee or tea which I appreciate!  The fresh baked goods section was where I spent most of my time.  The place isn't very big but you can walk in circles and find something new with each lap.  But the bakery...yum.  Let me just go ahead and recommend the burnt butter chocolate chip cookie.  I realize that \"burnt\" anything doesn't necessarily sound good but trust me...this cookie is off the charts!  It is more salty than normal so you really get the whole salty/sweet thing.  It is SO good!    We also tried the brussel sprout salad/slaw thing.  It was very good!  We tried the noodle salad thing too but it was a little bland.    The service was friendly.  I find this type of place to be expensive but you can certainly go there and get a couple things or dinner/lunch and it won't break the bank.  If you plan on picking up dinner on your way home to feed a family of 4, you are going to spend a pretty penny.  Overall, great place, nice addition to this area--casual but still trendy..attracts a diverse crowd and you don't feel like you need to dress up to fit in...I mean it IS called \"Earl's Grocery.\"  :) Enjoy!",

    "text": "Earl's Grocery is awesome! Think of it as a Dean and Deluca because they offer coffees and teas, high end grocery items, as well as hot bar and cold bar foods. Earl's goes a step beyond and has food made to order, one of the best being their No. 6 - a duck confit hash made with beets and coleslaw. SO GOOD! So filling but not heavy at all. The pork belly tacos are also good but very messy to eat and a little bit on the salty side. It's a great place to do work and hang out. The only thing I would say to management is to keep your bathroom cleaner - the floor was very sticky all throughout the bathroom and there was dirt all over the floor as well as little bathroom gnats.",

It can be busy during after work hours but I've never had trouble finding a seat. I recommend any of their specials- my current favorite is a cheese panini that is delicious.   I enjoy the beers that you can buy by the bottle and the wine selection as well. In the past I've made a cheese plate of my own by choosing one to two cheeses. They gave me a cheese board as well as a knife to cut it with.   They used to have a salad bar that I enjoyed but it looks like they have prepared salads now. They have free wifi as well. Highly recommend as an alternative to a coffee shop or a spot for an after-work coffee or drink.",

    "text": "I visited Earl's once right after they opened just to check out the place, but I didn't buy or eat anything. Then a few coworkers and I ventured in for lunch after seeing Wilson from WCCB talk about how awesome their banh mi is. I've been looking for a solid replacement since Peculiar Rabbit took theirs off the menu, so off we went.  We got there around 11:30 on a Friday, and the place was starting to fill up. I ordered my sammich, grabbed a number, and took a seat. My coworkers' ordering took a little longer, but all the staff were incredibly nice.   However, they accidentally made me TWO banh mi sandwiches, and I didn't get to keep the extra, but I was okay with that after I tried mine. It certainly wasn't anything like the one I had at Peculiar Rabbit or Yummi Banh Mi Truck. It was more like a shredded, pulled pork sandwich, open-faced on two pieces of long, chewy bread with no jalapenos. One of my coworkers also got it, and we both had to give up trying to eat it like a regular sandwich because the shredded pork was piled so high and the bread was so tough. We just grabbed some forks and ate the pork off the top. It was also a little pricey for what you got, and the only side options the fella behind the counter told me about were broccoli/cauliflower mix and something else that didn't sound too appetizing. I went broccoli/cauliflower and got perhaps two tiny florets of each.  Overall, I'll give Earl's another try because I like its intent with being able to order food to eat there, food to go, groceries, wine, and provisions, etc, but I definitely won't get the banh mi again.",

I stopped over myself for lunch, and was pleasantly surprised at the offerings.  1st, I was greeted by a awesome coffee counter, which made a splendid Americano (My 1st good one in a while).  Then I was immediately distracted but the pastries and cupcakes, which made my mouth drool a bit.   Steeling my reserve, I passed up the cupcakes (abet sadly) and headed to deli bar to place my order for a Bah Mi Pork sandwich.  Sandwiches were made fresh on the spot and they seemed to be using a local or in-house bread.      While my sandwich was being made, I was free to wonder through the wines and beer selections. The choices were good, and to my surprise, they had a couple niche ginger beers as well.   If your are around, stop by and check it out, I am sure you will find something there that will peak your interest, but beware it can also take a good bite out of your wallet.",

Nobody wants to say a word before they finish that big bowl of noodles and pork belly. After we do finish all we can talk about is how good it is, and ask ourselves why we don't come more often?   For around $20 both my husband and I can get our own Ramen (tried to share once, not a good idea) and a big bottle of water. Earl's spends 3 days preparing their ramen broth and you can just taste the love that goes into the bowl. The eggs are perfect in the soup, which is slightly runny (not my normal taste, but it works). The pork belly is the star, which it should, just the right amount of fat.   And as I'm typing this I am starting to make myself hungry.",

I showed up for lunch one day when I was looking for a quiet - yet kid-friendly place where I could potentially Pinterest while eating.  Earl's met all my needs.  I had a tough time deciding what to eat, but after perusing the menus I chose a meatball sub and a can of Le Croix.  You order & pay at the same place, so be prepared with your drink & sides when you order your food - that caught me off guard even though they had a sign there.. blonde moment.  While eating, I sat within view of the ice cream cooler and a display of fun drinks, it was very tempting and I definitely had to go research exactly what churro ice cream was - maybe next time, that meatball sub was delicious and left me stuffed!  On a nice day, I bet Earl's is a great place to sit out on the sidewalk, or just inside when they open the giant doors.  Pro tip: there is an entrance in back as well.",
