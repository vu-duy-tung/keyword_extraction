I like the tuna burger--build your own is better and about the same price as the listed one on the menu. I enjoy it with wasabi mayo & avocado. Sweet fries are my fave side but I also try the side salad when wanting veggies. Good NC beers too!",

I asked for a new top bun and bacon. I pulled the cheese from the burger and removed the pickle so that I would not need an entirely different new sandwich.  The server claimed that he would have the kitchen make a new top bun and bacon. After about five minutes, he brings out the same bun. How do I know that it was the same bun? Well it was cold this time and had ketchup and mustard smeared on it. Smeared  because they just wiped it off.  Disappointed and done with Bad Daddy's. They weren't even busy, it was before 5pm. Just lazy.",

For those looking for a slightly healthier option there's a large selection of ingredients for creating your perfect salad.  The service tends to be friendly, although it can be rather slow during peak hours.  While the food is always good, lately there have been problems with burgers getting overcooked.  Overall the food is great. Assuming the problems with cooking the burgers correctly get resolved, then I would not hesitate to rate Bad Daddy's a full 5 stars.",

My personal favorite is the Frenchie (turkey burger with Brie, bacon and green apples).  The sweet potato fries are great as well.  The wait is usually significant due to popularity.  Luckily, there is a large bar and nice outdoor areas where you can wait for a table.",

Fried pickles are the kosher pickle kind with the crispy breading with addictive non valley's ranch ranch dip YUM! All of a sudden the queen of will power is bumming tater tots off her co-workers plates. Not a coincidence my friends the food is worth the wait in line at lunch. Not to mention a tater tot dip in big daddy's sauce. Seriously love the place. Sometimes I hate the sub-par service but I will keep going back for more. It is hard to get burger fans and vegetarians to agree on a place for lunch. This place is it. On a side note for those meat eaters the meat is hormone free and grass fed burgers. Hooray!",

You can get a veggie burger in place of any beef for all the burgers-my favorite is the Cantina 1511 bean burger which has guac!  Other favorites are the fried pickles and tater tots.  Rather than choose from the standard menu my husband likes to create his own.  He loves pimiento cheeseburgers.  There's also a fun bar area with a nice beer selection and plenty of TVs for sports.  Also fun is the daily milkshakes--yumm!  I wouldn't recommend this as a place to take a group if you're planning to chat it up because the music is always too loud.  But it's perfect for 2-4 people who can sit pretty close and enjoy a delish burger with a cold beer.",

My friends from out of town were hungry and I thought of you (did you think of me too?). I knew you had something that would please everyone.  Ring, ring. What's going on? A party of 12 was no problem and was quickly seated on the toasty, heated patio.  Your awesome selection of local craft beers gave me bragging rights (drink local!) and my friends a sampling of what Charlotte has to offer.  Everyone was very happy with their burgers and sandwiches. I myself, finally conquered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids (that's really the name), a perfect medium rare, and lived to tell about it. As if that wasn't enough, the \"adult\" Mudslide milkshake went down so easy, my belly didn't know what hit it! Boom! Complete Satisfaction and Satiation!  I left fat and happy like a real American!

It was awe inspiring... the bacon was so juicy the perfect blend of salty-ness... the burger held together nicely and the fries are absolutely amazing!!! I am definitely making a return trip.

(California born and raised!) and then 2. There's the huge restaurant style burgers that you never finish, but have delicious left overs later.  This place takes the cake. You can build your own, so I usually do horseradish mayo, fried egg, bacon, jalapenos, cheese, onions and pickles!! Let me tell you.... you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "After reading several reviews, we expected to be blown away by quality, taste, and service. However, all of the aforementioned was lackluster at best. It wasn't incredibly busy so we were seated immediately, which was nice. Our server came over to our table quickly and got our drinks and appetizer order, which again was great. The rest of our order was taken shortly after. Our fried pickles came out fast and hot but that's where the good experience ends. The pickles were insanely thin and way over breaded, so for us, not enjoyable. Halfway through our appetizer, a large group came in and was seated across the restaurant. Our server took the table and all but forgot about us. Someone else brought out our SOGGY room temperature burgers. My husband and I were in conversation and rather than use their words, the person just shoved them in front of us nearly hitting my husband in the face and then walked off. We ordered the burgers with sauces on the side to avoid the soggy bottom but they sat so long before being brought to us that the heat from the beef caused the cold lettuce to wilt and soggy up our bottom buns to the point where my husbands disintegrated when he picked it up. As far as flavor, there wasn't anything to write home about. I had a burger with deep fried bacon and it was all breading. So really, it was like eating a burger with deep fried flour. I took it off and hoped the burger would improve. It didn't. All throughout our \"meal\", there was someone hollering at the bar and was being encouraged to holler more by the bartender. In an already loud atmosphere, it was awful. We didn't see our server again until we were ready to leave. Honestly, we won't go back. We were hoping to find another awesome burger joint for when we are in the Charlotte area but we'll stick with our favorite burger joint in Rock Hill.",

    "text": "Bad Daddy's food is very good but service and attitude can be a little spotty at this location.   Specifically, Bad Daddy's is a poor choice for group get togethers. Last month, a group of 10 of us had reserved a table right at 5PM for a post-work get together. The restaurant was nearly empty when 6 of us showed up - 2 folks had a firedrill come up at the office they were tending to and the other 2 had gotten lost on the way to the restaurant. The hostess refused to seat us until everyone else arrived, which we found ridiculous, given that at most, 2 other tables in the restaurant were occupied and no one was waiting for a table besides us. We wanted to sit down after a long day and have drinks while we waited for our friends, but we couldn't do that until everyone was rounded up and accounted for.  I completely understand this policy at peak hours, when you can't have 2 people taking up a table for 10, but to set the policy in stone at non-peak hours when the restaurant is empty isn't good business. They lost extra drink sales while six of us stood awkwardly at the front door of a nearly empty restaurant waiting for a few minutes. Finally when the 2 lost teammates arrived they relented and gave us a table for 8, which they made sure we knew was \"against their usual policy\". With a sea of empty tables around us they wouldn't pull over an extra two top until our coworkers who had to deal with an issue at work arrived 20 minutes later - when the restaurant was still cavernously empty.  The food at Bad Daddy's is very good but I'm not a traditional burger fan. On this last visit, I searched for my favorite, the Banh Mi burger (which is a pork burger) only to find it's been taken off the menu. I had a hard time choosing between all of the other options, since they didn't really appeal to me. It's a shame they removed my favorite option. Their menu is somewhat limited.  If other people want to go to Bad Daddy's, I'll go with them, but after this last visit, I see no reason to initiate going there myself.",

    "text": "I would usually feel guilty about eating a big ol' honkin' burger for lunch, but I tend to cut myself a little slack on Fridays.  Therefore, last Friday I went just down the street to Bad Daddy's to enjoy a big ol' honkin' burger.  The decor is fairly typical for a popular burger joint: lots of posters, servers dressed in black shirts and jeans, and so on.  They were already busy at 11:45, so if you're on your lunch break, I wouldn't show up at noon.  However, I was seated with minimal fuss and proceeded to order a Southern Classic burger, with chili and slaw, accompanied by sweet potato fries.  The burger turned out to be quite tasty, if not quite as tasty as a certain fairly-close restaurant's.  There was just the right amount of pink, and the slaw and chili were both freshly made and good.  The sweet potato fries were nice as well.  I initially thought that thousand-island was a strange dip selection, but it turned out to work well.  My only complaint was that Bad Daddy's definitely follows the narrow and stacked-high burger model.  This might look cooler than a wider, flatter burger, but it makes the thing very messy to eat.  I brought a textbook to lunch, but it went untouched, as I feared to slop on its pages.  My conclusion: go early, don't bring a book, but try Bad Daddy's.",

Cooked to perfection and the apple was surprisingly cooked but still not mushy.  Was absolutely thrilled to find they had hard cider on tap and for that, I will return many times.  Their shakes are also amazing. Very wonderful meal and definitely worth a second visit.",

They do have good burgers here, so if that is what you are looking for you will not be disappointed.  I do not care for their fries though, and the tater tots and chips are typically over salted.  They also accept the local \"Ballantyne Card,\" which gives you a 15% discount from 11am-1pm; which is good because they are somewhat pricy.  The atmosphere is loud by design.  The menu selection is robust, so there should be something for everyone.

That was, without question, the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten in my life, and probably a tie for the best burger.  Options is the name of the game at this place, and there are plenty.  A practically endless array of combinations of unique toppings to put on your burger (battered and fried bacon, anyone?).  My sandwich was fairly standard as far as the toppings went (bacon, poblano mayo, guacamole), but cooked to perfection.  My wife's burger, which she claims is the best she's ever had, was a beef burger (cooked medium, yay for grinding your own meat) with brie, bacon, and garlic mayo.  There were countless cheeses and toppings to choose from, and we finished the meal off with some exquisite banana pudding.    I'm told that tonight was an anomaly, and that normally we'd have seen a line out the door to be seated, so I guess we got lucky.  It's going to be tough not to come here on ever trip to the Queen City after this.  I'm thankful that we have a place in Asheville that can compare, otherwise I'd be depressed to leave tomorrow.",

    "text": "Today, Bad Daddy's was just OK.  Nothing special and I left feeling like the experience was a bit lacking.  I went with the family which includes 2 young kids.  To start off, I love the location and the decor is well done.  Nice ambiance and not too crowded for a late Sunday lunch. To start off with, my 4 year old wanted Mac and Cheese as a side.  They only have Mac and Cheese on Mondays.  Why in the heck would you only have mac and cheese one day a week, and on a Monday at that?  Weird.  Next, they had a special burger which didn't sound too appealing to me but it came with beer battered onion rings.  I asked if I could get an order of those, and was denied because they didn't have enough.  Again, weird.  I would have ordered the more commonplace (apparently) onion straws but I had them before and didn't care for them that much. I wound up getting fries which were overcooked, tasteless, and obviously the scraps leftover from the lunch rush.  At least, if you're a \"gourmet\" burger place, offer decent fries.  The tater tots that my daughter got with her hot dog were very good though and I ate off her plate. On to the burger.  I feel it is a restaurants responsibility, if I order a burger, no matter what I put on it to provide me with a non messy or soggy, burger that is well put together and provides a taste of all the topping in each bite.  This burger fell short of this expectation.  I ordered it Med Rare, and it was so greasy / soggy that the bun was saturated and the burger had to be eaten with a fork and knife (man point deduction).  So, the bun was not strong enough, and the burger was too \"wet\".  They also didn't distribute the toppings evenly and as a result they were all over the place.  I think if more care was given to the preparation it would have turned everything around.  Just slopping a burger and toppings on a bun when I'm paying the $$ I paid for this lunch isn't going to generate repeat business. I like the concept of Bad Daddy's, I really do.  I may go back again, but to be honest there are plenty of places to get a burger and this past experience was lacking.",

    "text": "Went with the family here on Saturday night.  The place was busy, and after being told that we would have a 30 minute wait, our pager lit up 10 minutes after we got it.  Our server was great in letting us know about the special beers and food that was available.  I ordered one of the special beers, and it was quite good.   She came by later to ask what I thought about it.  We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, and I have to say, I was very disappointed.  I am a fan of fried pickles, but these were way too salty for us, and we were only able to have about half of the order before we gave up.  One reason why I like Bad Daddy's is that they have a buffalo burger.  I am a huge fan of buffalo, and to me, it has a better taste than beef and is overall better for you.  My oldest had the same burger, and loved it.  It really is served well.  I also liked how the sides are served in small bowls, separate from the rest of the meal.    I got their home made potato chips, and they are very good!  Very crispy.  I have had other home made chips at other restaurants, but they usually end up soggy and all bunched together.  Our server did keep tabs on us, and got refills on our drinks.  Well, except for my request for another beer on special.  Either she did not hear it or just forgot.  Regardless, the food was good (except for the fried pickles), the service was overall good, and the restaurant is loud.  Not a place to have a nice, quiet dinner.  We will go back, but there are so many other restaurants to try in the area!",

The burgers/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!  The wings fit well on the \"expected\" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef.   The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.  The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar/dairy laden enjoyment.   Outdoor seating is phenomenal.  Service is always friendly and fast. These guys are doing a great job with their entire chain of restaurants across the Queen City. Hats off, ladies and gents.   Great Charlotte staple. Perfect place for 2, family, with kids or whatever.",

Now, there are a few things that removed a star. Sometimes the toppings aren't quite correct - for example, the awesome Magic Mushroom burger had very few actual mushrooms on it. But what it did have, and the sauce, was amazing. And the quality of liquor is questionable. The Bloody Mary looked great, but the first sip and I could taste a bitterness in the vodka. There was also way more ice than necessary, which isn't desirable in a $7 drink. And they carry Mark West Pinot Noir, which in my opinion is a over-priced wine that tastes of oak. I'm sure beer lovers will be better pleased with their offerings.  A couple of other suggestions:  Go with a different catsup. French's is WAY too sweet. Hunts or Heinz has a better balance (and Hunts has no additives).  Balance out the slaw. There's something odd in the taste. It's like it tastes a tad off. I suspect less mayo-base and maybe a bit more acidic would help. That, or go with a Greek dressing that does NOT include Greek yogurt.  It's not cheap, so I feel justified in having a few opinions. But overall, it's a very pleasant place, and you won't leave hungry (you'll leave with leftovers). We've visited and gotten take out several times, so it's definitely a place I'll continue to patronize. It just still has a little room for improvement.",

The jalapeno bacon adds a nice kick, but the chicken patty was a little too dry. It was also very thick so there could have been more flavor overall. I ate half and saved the rest for dinner.   Another pro tip: onion rings aren't listed as a side on the menu, but they are a side. 10/10 would recommend.  Service is consistently friendly and prompt.",

I really love their brand, the entire ambience can cater to any demographic, and it takes the southern style to their menu.  I have eaten here several times and I commend them on their high quality food and even better quality service. One of our servers was training in his first few days and one huge takeaway I had from the experience is that he stopped by the table without his trainer and chatted with us for a few moments, nothing serious mostly just small talk. But, things like this create culture in a restaurant and this is where a lot of places lack.   Now to the food, where the heck can I start. This place has got it. This particular occasion I got the Smokehouse burger. Let me warn you, don't get this thing if you have a small appetite. It comes out with some pretty dang good pulled pork, onion straws, and a burger with pepper jack cheese. I got a side salad with ranch, even this was incredible! This entire place has this niche market on lock, I can't wait to bring in new customers, and try your other locations!   PS- consider changing your name to amazing daddys",

    "text": "After driving by several times and doing a quick search on Yelp, I decided to finally try this place. I had a craving for a good burger so the timing was right. Unfortunately, my whole experience was bad from the beginning. When we first walked in, one of the servers walked right in front of us so we said hello. He did not reply and completely ignored us. While we ate, I noticed that he was walking around with a blank stare looking at employees and serving tables like he was a loss prevention officer at Best buy instead of a waiter. Why in the world would someone with this personality be hired by a restaurant? I was expecting higher prices since this is a specialty burger place but the quality of the food does not hold up to their expensive menu. The parmesan truffle fries were OK but had just faint hint of truffle in them. The onion straws were not crunchy at all and were full of grease at the bottom of the plate. The NIck's Patty melt that I ordered was soggy and the caramelized onions on top were more like boiled onions, without a hint of brown. Come on, a patty melt is pretty hard to mess up. In general, the whole staff seems to lack any basic customer service skills. They were very inattentive, seemed bothered when interacting with us, and would disappear to go talk among themselves. I got the impression that the staff feels that I should be flattered to have the opportunity to eat at such a \"hip and happening place.\" A smile goes an long way people! If you are going to charge high prices, the service and the food must be impeccable.",

I like to describe some of the low-lights from my visit; first I was disappointed to see a new menu meant a change to their nachos (and not a change for the better). Second, there were four of us and three orders came out wrong (batting .250 might be good enough to make the Royals but it is a disappointment at lunch). Third, all of the burgers were ordered medium and all four came out closer to rare, which was surprising based on how long it took to bring the food out.   As much as I enjoyed my previous trips to Big Daddy's, I am afraid this was probably my last.",

And their salads are quite delicious, too. BDBB also features a chef's special, and many times I've been pleased with the chef's choice.  We always get very good, very friendly service, and the hostesses up front are always pleasant. The only things I don't care for are the amount of flat-screen TVs always tuned to some lame college football game, and the obnoxiously loud classic rock station on Sirius Radio that plays utterly terrible classic rock tunes you never want to hear again.  Expect some lengthy waits around lunchtime, and on weekends.  (PS - this review is in reference to the Ballantyne location.)",

There was no wait, and the restaurant was barely half full.  But I could easily see how this place could get very busy.    The server was good, fast, efficient.  The decor of the restaurant is great and fits what you would expect a burger place to be like.    I ordered the Classic Southern Burger which is a burger topped with Chili, coleslaw, lettuce, and pickle.  I also got the sweet potato fries.  My fellow diner got the basic burger and added bacon, and cheese, along with a Guinness from their very expansive drinks menu.    As far as the quality of food we can't complain.  The burgers were very tasty and the fries weren't soggy or cold.  The only problem I have is with prices.  Beer prices are actually very reasonable.  But, my Southern Burger was 8.00.  Which is somewhat reasonable for a good burger and some fries. My girlfriend added Bacon and cheese to hers and it was 9.50.  9.50 for a burger with bacon and cheese is just kind of pushing it.  The Burgers were good, but I can't say that it tasted twice as good as a Five Guy's burger, or 25% better than a Chili's Burger.    But as you read the menu, you get the feeling that you're paying more for the fact that the menu is well prepared and the meat is bought from the right places.  And that is something I can appreciate.    We will be back, but maybe not as often as we would have been if the burgers were just psychologically a little bit cheaper.",

I had Emilio's chicken sandwich, it was wonderful!  But then again, what isn't to love about a bacon crusted chicken breast with guacamole, jalapeno bacon, poblano pepper mayo, and mozzarella cheese?  It had the perfect balance of sweetness and heat.   The staff is extremely friendly, and the food is quite good.  They take pride in what they serve, and make sure that you enjoy the experience as much as possible. On our last visit there, one of our salads came incorrectly.  We brought it to the attention of our server who promptly apologized and then took it back to the kitchen to correct the situation.  As soon as the waitress seemed to disappear, the manager came out and made sure that the entire situation was being corrected properly.   **I must be 100% honest here... It seems as if every other time we go out to eat at various restaurants, there is a problem in one of our orders.  But Bad Daddy's definitely set the bar extremely high for how other managers need to handle those problems.",

    "text": "Finally got up on a Sunday early enough to make it for breakfast! I had a really hard time deciding on what to order. Everything sounded so good. In the end i had their version of eggs benedict  with queso and a side of jalapeno bacon. It was pretty awesome.The standout, as usual with me, was definitely the bacon. My friend got the breakfast burger and enjoyed it. I saw pancakes being carried by and wow those looked fantastic. Mental note made for next time. Id say the prices are fair for the meals as well. One thing though, our service wasn't that great. After being seated we waited about 10 min for a server, while the tables around us were being helped. They were not even busy. Actually now that i think about it inconsistent service has been an issue the past few times ive eaten there. Hopefully this turns around soon. I still think the food is still amazing.",

Now, mind you it was a very enjoyable, warm Saturday evening in February (which doesn't come around to often). I called in our orders and ran to pick it up on my break. It was ready when I got there. Thank you for that Bad Daddy's! Bar tender was friendly, had the food ready, payment was easy and she was pretty to boot!  Both of us ordered the Catina Burger (black bean veggie burger) and sweet potato fries, which is $9.45 and $10.23 with tax. Delicious! The platter comes with chipotle ranch with the fries and a honey mustard for the burger. I wasn't a huge fan of the ranch, but loved the honey Dijon and dipped the fries in it. Yummy. Fries are good, but nothing too outlandish. The star of the show was the Catina, hands down! Two thumbs up! My coworker got her burger crispy/fried and I had mine grilled. Very hearty burger, homemade.. Not just a patty! Add the fresh, crispy lettuce, red onions and tomato along with a few slices of avocado, and melted cheese on a toasted bun. DELICIOUS!!!!  I also ordered the Create Your Own milkshake for $5.50. I got fresh strawberries, coconut syrup and Ghiradelli chocolate.. It was definitely interesting, very thick and filling, and I loved eating the strawberries at the bottom!   Only gripe would be that price of varying items is a bit high, which is where the 5th star would be. If any of the food were happy hour items, on special or the burger was just $2 off, this would be more of a regular spot instead of a treat. In saying that though, I can't wait to try the salads!",

I get it, it was busy. I arrived with a friend, my husband and my daughter. We walked In, and the hostess was very inviting and nice. We sat In the patio and looked over the menu.... 15 minutes later no one had come to greet us. No one even gave us water. NO ONE. Meanwhile a bus girl or server was cleaning a table to the side of us... but completely ignored us. As we were getting ready to leave 2 servers came out and neither one acknowledged us. The door to the inside dining area was open so I kept turning back looking to see if someone would come to our table. Again, all we got were looks. Eventually the hostess sat another table outside behind us and a server came running outside telling them to please work with them bc they were running behind bc it was so busy. That was the last straw, we got completely ignored for 15 MINUTES. We got up and left and again the hostess and that server just looked at us but no one tried to make it right. This was very unacceptable. It made us feel like bc we were not white, we did not deserve good service & I assume it's bc they thought we were there to be cheap. I know how it is in predominately white areas/ restaurants. When a black or Hispanic walks in no one wants to wait on them bc they think we are \"cheap\". Well let me tell you we are far from That and although they probably don't care , we will never again step foot there.",

Seriously these were some of the best fries I can remember eating in a long, long time.   Now for the burger.   I ordered it medium rare (as I do everywhere that serves it that way), but I'm fairly certain it was rare. Like - rare rare. Regardless I ate it....and it was still pretty good, but if it was cooked right I really think it would have been as tasty as the burger I had the first time I came here.   Mistake on the burger, AWESOME fries, good beer (two hearted ale), and really friendly staff. I'll give it 4 stars....but I'll update it to 5 if my burger is cooked right next time I go.

We came here on a Friday around 6:30 and we had about a 10 minutes wait. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, they have great bar prices!   Next, we were seated and given menus. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly and had great timing. I ordered the Pittsburgh inspired burger and hubs for the BBQ burger. We both loved our burgers, they were cooked perfectly. The sides were also amazing, I love the truffle tots!! We will definitely work this into our normal routine, this is a great location and great vibes!",

The combination of the bacon, onion straws and BBQ sauce was perfection. Juicy, flavorful and definitely worth a return trip.  Any restaurant that serves tater tots instead of fries is o.k. with me!

We got there right at 9pm and were seated promptly. With it being late and starting to slow down, we were able to watch the service at other tables. I watched a total of about 6 servers and they all gave great service to their table and the 2 servers who waited on us or brought my husband his beer, were also really customer focused. The server for the table next to us took pictures of that table after they requested it and seemed happy to do it. Not like \" ugh, let me just get this over with\".  As far as the food, we were all happy with our orders. My friend had the sliders and I don't eat beef but wow they smelled amazing! My husband had the patty melt. He ordered it medium well and it was a little pink for MW but still in his ok range and he still enjoyed it. His fries were FANTASTIC! I ordered the Stella Greek salad and had them toss it with the dressing rather than have it on the side. That can be a little dicey b/c you never know if it's going to be drowned in dressing but it came out with the perfect amount. I typically order the black bean burger but decided on the salad and I was so happy with it. The chicken was flavorful and cooked just right. I really loved being able to stick with healthy eating for the evening and it being so fresh and flavorful...not an afterthought of just throwing a salad on the menu just to say you serve salads!  Overall we had a great meal and I left wondering why we've been away for so long and that it certainly wouldn't be that long before our next visit.",

Oh my goodness what an incredible experience. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was incredible. First the food. We started off with their fried pickles...quite an incredible start. I had the Bad Ass burger...which was ginormous and my wife had the chicken club. Yes she was in the mood for a burger but changed her mind when she looked over the menu. We did share the burger and club. The best of both worlds. Now the service. We were greeted by this very nice and sweet young lady by the name Libby. She started off by giving me a hard time for wearing a beautiful blue UNC shirt. The reason she started off with the hard time is because she is a NC State grad. I enjoyed her giving me a hard time. Thank God she was not a Duke grad. Libby was an incredible person and gave us great service. Do yourselves a favor a visit this restaurant and ask for Libby to be your server. You will not reget it.",

We had it on a wheat bun and it was topped off with an over easy egg, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. I have to say... THAT WAS THE BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN YEARS!! I ate the whole entire monterous thing! The sweet potato fries and regular fries were also amazing. Both of my boys thoroughly enjoyed their chicken tenders and sliders as well.   After our meal was nearly finished, the manager also came over and introduced herself and made sure we were enjoying ourselves and our meal.

When I was asked to meet for lunch at Big Daddy's, I thought, \"Crap, I hate fast food.\"  Not only that, I figured this would be a greasy, sleepy afternoon type lunch.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  I was honestly pleasantly surprised.  This was far from that greasy burger joint I had pictured just hours before going there.  This was an a-la-carte, somewhat healthy place to eat.  I ordered a traditional burger with a bunch of trimmings --when I say a bunch, I really mean about 4-5 and that was about 30% of what you could actually get on the burger.  The burger was cooked nicely and was extremely juicy and tasty.  In addition, I got a side salad.  Again, with an a-la-carte style order and literally, you could get anything on this thing --including several different kinds of lettuces.  The service was very prompt and the food was out very quickly --though there were only two of us for lunch.  The restaurant seemed nice and clean and the staff were very polite.  The restaurant was a very causal environment and pretty loud --a perfect place to take kids, especially crazy one's like mine.   I'll certainly be going back to this place and I'm looking forward to it, too.",

I usually do the build your own salad, but tonight I went with the Cantina burger (veggie) and it was awesome.  Hubs always gets the Western burger (buffalo) and he swears buy it.  Juicy, meaty and totally delicious.   My favorite appetizer is the fried pickles, but tonight we tried the homemade chips and pimento cheese and it was also awesome.    As we were paying the bill our server (Ashley) asked if we'd ever been in for breakfast and we said we hadn't.  She offered us a to-go menu and told us we should certainly check it out.  (And I'm sure we will)!  I highly recommend Bad Daddy's for a work lunch, a lunch w/friends or a night out with the family.  Great atmosphere, excellent food and fantastic service.  Proud to call this franchise local and excited to see where it goes!",

Seriously though - after I left, I felt like all my insides were coated with grease. I needed a shower immediately.  Despite the grease, the burger was awesome! My burger was just topped with a fried egg and bacon and it went really well together.  The serving sizes were pretty big, I got a side of tater tots and hardly put a dent in the bowl considering I was full after a few bites of the burger.  Neat place, tasty food, good beer...

    "text": "The ONLY thing saving this joint from 1 star is their tater tots.  When this Ballantyne location first opened, it was our go-to burger place for juicy burgers, great apps/sides and spiked shakes.  Apparently complacency has kicked in and the last three times we have been there have been a train wreck of overcooked burgers and indifferent service.    I used to meet a friend here pretty regularly, as it was a halfway point between our homes, and we would meet early, typically on a Friday just after they open.  I don't know if the wait staff drags at 11:00 in the morning or what, but empty drinks when there are only 3 or 4 other tables sat is ridiculous.  But they had enough energy to stand around in a pack around the POS machine and chit chat (I would think having lunch with someone in a military uniform would cause service to step it up - but from a generation that thinks the world owes them a trophy for participation, I guess not).  Two of the last three times, my burger was dry and overcooked - what happened to the juicy burger that was cooked as ordered?  The last spiked shake was poorly blended and had a puddle of vodka at the bottom - how do you screw up a milkshake?  The tater tots were perfect though, super crunchy and hot.    With the new wave of burger joints opening all over Charlotte, there is no reason to suffer through mediocre (at best) service and overcooked burgers.",

On this particular visit I decided to try something new and got the fried mozzarella burger. As you can probably imagine from the name, it's a burger topped with a slice of fried mozzarella. It was so big I could barely open my mouth wide enough to take a bite. It was really just ok. The mozzarella didn't taste very fresh and was kinda chewy, and I had ordered the burger cooked medium, but it was well done. I hate to complain and almost didn't but I was just so disappointed- a lot of what makes this my favorite burger joint is that I can get a burger with a little pink in it. Finally I asked if they could make me a new one, medium. The manager brought it out and within minutes came back to check on me. She noticed it still was on the done side but I said it was better and would be good enough. Although it still was slightly more done than I preferred, this time it was super fresh and the mozzarella on it was amazing, so much better than my first burger. Thanks to the staff for making your customers happy!",

I wish the onion straws were a little bigger, so they would be easier to eat but the coating was fantastic and it didn't fall off the onions like some onion straws. Everything was yummy and we had a very relaxing, calm dinner which is exactly what we were looking for.  When we're in the mood for burgers again, we'll definitely go back.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go to Bad Daddy's Burger Bar for some time now.  Every time I have had an opportunity to go it had been too crowded and ended up going somewhere else.  On this day, I timed it just right and was able to beat the lunch crowd.  Atmosphere - Spacious, Noisy, Casual, Concrete, Corrugated Metal, On the verge of being a big chain feel.  Service - Friendly, Attentive, Communicative, Well trained.  Food - I opted for what's in the title of the restaurant and went with a burger...a basic burger, medium well, w/ grilled onions and a side of tater tots (maybe I am a 12 yr old).  The burger arrived after what started to seem like a long wait.  I noticed others where waiting too as the place was slammed.  Luckily, within minutes of noticing the length of my wait, I turned to see our order arriving.  Let me start of by saying that my side of tater tots was more like a meal.  The portion of tots in the stainless steel bowl was huge!  I would almost say it was enough for two people to enjoy.  Unfortunately, while large in portion these tots were a little dry/ overcooked.  While disappointing, this was okay as it helped to prevent me from eating them all.  The burger looked good at first; however, upon reaching down to assemble it I was greeted with a soggy mess of a bun.  Half of the bottom bun was as wet as could be from, I assume, the grilled onions.  This could have been avoided if the onions were slightly tapped dry or the bun had been of a heartier nature.  I did a little bun surgery and was able to assemble the remnants into a form of a burger.  No ketchup or mustard was added as to avoid any additional moisture to an already fairly damp situation.  I guess I could have asked for a new bun...but...I was limited on time.    The burger tasted okay, as it was cooked as requested.  It was juicy without tasting greasy...but I missed my k&m flavors.  Overall - It was a decent experience and I am willing to give BDBB another try...sans the grilled onions of course.",

We expected it to be busy and have to wait for a table since it was Saturday night and we're told it was at least a 30 minute wait.  No problem...we'll sit at the bar and have a drink.  No sooner than we ordered our drinks, we were paged that our table was ready.  We thought it was strange since there were people standing around waiting who had arrived before us.  We were led to what had to be the worst table in the house...right next to the door that led to the patio.  Every single person who passed through that door brushed against me.  The table was sticky, and extremely wobbly, which is completely annoying.  To give credit where it is due, our waitress was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive.  Our food arrived quickly, and was delivered to our table by a woman with the worst attitude I've ever seen in a restaurant.  She was carrying dishes to our table and the one next to us.  No eye contact, she never said a word...she slammed a plate in front of my husband who told here it was not ours.  Without a word she grabbed it and slammed it to the table next to us.  She gave my food to my husband, and I got his.  She left without saying a single word.  The customers at the next table just looked at us in the same disbelief.  My husband asked for ketchup since our bottle was empty, a bottle was dumped on our table without a word.  It was definitely some of the worst customer service we have ever experienced.  The food was great, with the exception of the bacon, which had a weird cinnamon taste.  Maybe it was just an off night, but that was definitely not the experience we expected.",

They forgot to out the bacon on it and they brought it out separate once I reminded them. It was two pieces of not really well cooked bacon - it was pretty mushy and undercooked but I didn't want to wait longer to eat so I threw it on my burger. I also asked for guacamole at $.75 to be on the burger. It was barely anything. I couldn't even taste it so I just put ketchup on it. I brought this up the waitress and she was indifferent.

I decided to order the Texican Chicken Salad ($9.50)  which normally is served with fried bacon-encrusted chicken (ick) but they were happy to substitute plain grilled chicken instead.  Also, I had them hold the onions and the salad was perfect.   In addition to iceberg lettuce & tomato, the salad also includes black beans and corn (fresh off the cob), cilantro, tortilla strips, and chipotle ranch sauce (which I got on the side).  The salad dressing had just the right amount of slow burn and the flavors were perfectly balanced. This is the most delicious salad I've had in a long time!   My friend ordered a burger and chips. His only complaint was that they were a little too generous with the mayo.... but other than that, he was happy. I tried one of his chips and it was really a good homemade chip - crispy and not greasy.  Service was good last night - they were busy, but our server promptly took our order and kept our drinks filled.   Yep, this is the place to go if someone is hankering for a super salad or fresh cooked to order burgers (including turkey or black bean burgers).",

Sweet potato fries are a great side and they have an excellent selection of local draft beer, though I wish they had better beer specials.  The shrimp burger is amazing and you should try one. They also have a burger special that can sometimes be good.  The reason I rate them so highly is that they also have an awesome breakfast.  Grits and biscuits here are dang good!",

I had a burger with mozzarella, tomato and a wheat bun while my husband had a chili burger. Super good place for burgers!  Our service was really good too. It was late on a Thursday night, so they weren't busy, but our waiter was friendly and nice. She brought us a few beers to taste and our sweet potato fries out quickly (extra points because we were incredibly hungry).  I'd never heard of this place before, though I think it's a chain? The inside is classic sports bar-ish with fun decor and good music.",

When you ask for Medium Rare you actually get medium rare! Patties are seasoned and taste great even without any of the toppings or sauces they make, but I do recommend people try theirs sauces as they are all very good. Tater tots are amazing and the sauce that comes with them is addictive. My only disappointment was the bun selection, not a fan of brioche but by no means a deal breaker. With the gourmet burger craze going on this place stands out.",

My husband had the \"bad ass burger\" with fries, and I ordered the \"daddy's philly\" with no jalapenos and for my side, sweet potatoes. I can't explain with words how was it, and the sauces that comes with it. O-M-G! Big, juicy, burgers that comes anyway you can imagine, because you can create your own! Any combination available.   Of course, definitely be back and trying different items from the menu.  We took leftovers and additional sauces that Bailegh package for us.   Hands down!",

So many choices for toppings it was hard to decide. I loaded one up. The best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. Huge breast cooked perfect, crisp and juicy. I had mine mounded  high with LTO, apple bacon bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon, fried onion strings. My wife enjoyed hers as well, she's been asking to return.    We sat at the bar and had excellent service, the bartenders were very friendly and attentive.  We opted to try a salted caramel and pretzel milkshake. As good as that sounds, it  tasted even better.  thick, creamy, sweet, salty! Please do yourself a favor and go have a chicken sandwich and a milkshake! We will return soon",

We arrived around 11:30 for a Saturday lunch and we're promptly greeted and sat by the hostess....who has been there for years and always greets you like you're a regular.  I ordered a build your own sandwich, fried chicken, brioche bread and fried mozzarella (it was an early birthday lunch after all); with a side of chips.  Their chips are house made and are delicious; though the fresh cut fries provide some competition for which is better.  Back to the sandwich....Bad Daddy's fried chicken sandwich is so good, crispy and flavorful breading with hot, juicy chicken underneath.  The fried mozzarella on top was house made (no Frozen stuff here).  My husband had a buffalo burger with a side of fries, which was also quite tasty.        I just wished that they still served breakfast...it was yummy!       Bonus - Sign up for their loyalty club and they send you a coupon for a free sandwich on your birthday!",

Unfortunately, this place is packed almost every time I come here. The most recent time was on a Saturday at 7pm and we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.  I've had a lot of the different burgers on the menu and I've never had one that I didn't like. This time I decided to get the Sam I Am burger with chips. I loved it. The pesto, egg, and ham combo works really well on a burger. The chips were pretty good as well.   Our service was also not great this time, which wasn't all that surprising given how crowded it was. It took a long time for us to be able to order, a long time to get our food, a long time to get our water refilled, and a long time to get our checks.   All in all, I love Bad Daddy's and I would recommend trying it, but I would try to come at an off time to avoid the crowds.",

    "text": "Went for the first time last night. I got Daddy's Philly and my fiance got the Badass burger.  Mine was decent, I got it without jalapenos. It was pretty flavorless, not enough bell pepper/onion/cheese. Sweet potato fries were good.   My fiance liked his burger except for the fried bacon on it. I tried some and I agreed with him that is was too much crisp breading, the taste of bacon was drowned out.   It was his birthday so he got a birthday milkshake, which took entirely too long to get to our table. We sat and watched the bartender make it, then she just left it in the mixing cup. A man came over to see if we needed something since we were watching the bar to see when she would finish the milkshake. We told him we were waiting on it, he went over and finished it.   Our waitress was so-so. She didn't come to our table much. She didn't explain anything on the menu even when we said it was our first time there.   When we got home, my fiance said he felt nauseous. Today, the morning after eating, he is still nauseous. So I'm not sure if it's food poisoning or his stomach just disagreed with a burger (something he eats all the time with no issue).   Overall it was just okay, not as good as other people told me it was. Too expensive for what we got, probably won't return.",

    "text": "There's something special about Bad Daddy's Burger Bar. It sports the typical ambiance of a well established watering hole, but with the sophistication of a meticulously thought out cuisine. Each meaty concoction relishes in the bar's persona, from the titles of each dish (like my burger of choice, the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids), to the description of what they've carefully decided to squish between two delicious buns.  When I arrived, I was greeted courteously by a friendly hostess who showed me to a table. She politely introduced herself and asked for my drink of choice. Being the classy critic that I am, I ordered myself a southern sweet iced tea, to reflect the culture of the South. Once she left, my eyes wandered around the somewhat noisy atmosphere.  Within this review, I will not mark down this establishment based on the noise of it's guests, since it is a sports bar, and is to be expected. The music took a polite bow and played delicately in the background, as if to support any empty silence with it's humble presence. To be honest with my fellow food loving friends, I don't remember what music was being played. I was also too distracted by the monstrous flat screens that surrounded the bar. Cheers would rise and fall as teams attempted to best their competitors.   Although I have an intellectual interest in many societal pursuits, sports have never been an activity I pursued or granted much attention to. All I knew was that there were a lot of people in suits talking about athletes who were trying to throw a ball to somewhere important for points or something. This, in itself, is also irrelevant to my review.  Within a timely manner, my burger had glided onto the table with a subtle ease from my friendly waitress. I had ordered it medium rare, and I could see the juices dripping from the delicately made tower of protein and calories. It was perfect.  I devoured the sandwich with my manly jaws as I felt the wonderfully cooked juices dripping into my beard. There were plenty of napkins to wipe away the residue, which I used judiciously. Next, I bit into the hearty crunch of the perfectly prepared fries. Within a few minutes, the beautiful burger banquet had been consumed.  My stomach approved of the message the meal had just delivered, and I waited for my check. It, like the burger, arrived quickly because of the attentive waitress. She was constantly aware of her surroundings, and although I do not remember her name, she deserves a mention in this review for how great of a job she did.   After leaving Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, I can leave a hearty recommendation for anyone looking for a place where they can sink their teeth into a delicious, juicy burger.   So, why did I give it 4 stars? Well, the answer is simple. I don't watch sports.",

There is an art to making nachos so the chips aren't mush - no art here.  The whole plate was a mushy mess.   Anyone can see we did not eat our food ....except the waitresses at Bad Daddy's.

Then we waited and waited but never saw a server in our section. I noticed a server that we liked had an open table so I went to the front to ask to move since we did not seem to have a server. The woman open mouth yawned at me and said she would send him over. She replaced the coke with a lemonade and left. A few minutes later she came back and asked if the new server had come over yet. He had not. She then went over to him and was shaking her head and pointing at us and seemed aggravated so we just decided to leave. I am pretty sure the woman was a Manger but either way it is going to be a while before I go back.",

They cook my burger to a perfect medium and its never dried out. I especially like the side salad option and that you get to pick your own ingredients. It certainly is NOT one of those premade iceberg salad mixes like you get at some places. You get to choose between 4 greens (I get spinach) and then can add 7 additional ingredients. It has been too long since I have been by Bad Daddy's and I expect to be back real soon!",

    "text": "Not a great experience. Visiting from out of town and craving a good burger.  The food was OK but the service left a lot to be desired.  We arrived at 8pm, after the dinner rush, and we were seated promptly but waited almost 10 minutes before anyone took our drink order.  I had clear vision of the drink/order area were 4 people were working (including the manager).  I made eye contact with all four of them and it was obvious we were waiting to give an order (menus on the table, no drinks, looking around) and still no one came.  I had just suggested we leave when someone finally came for our drink order.  When she brought them back she just  set them down and walked away and we sat for another 3 or so minutes until a guy came over and said our server was busy so he would help out and take our order.  We each ordered a burger medium ( hot, pink center). When they arrived one of them was raw to the point of being cold in the center, so we had to send it back.  Our server was very apologetic and offered a free dessert.  While we were eating the manager came over and apologized and said she would comp one meal.  Okay, that's better.  The server offered to still comp a dessert if we wanted it, which we declined.  When the bill came, it was discounted but they charged us for 3 burgers instead of the 2 we ordered so it was still wrong, although they corrected it quickly.  Overall, it felt like the first girl was our real server but she knew she messed up by not getting our order so she traded tables with our second server so she could still make a tip from someone else.  Our second server was good, attentive, apologetic, and appropriately called the situation to the attention of the manager.  But the overall experience is what would keep me from returning if I lived in the area.",

This would be one case I'd have to agree that \"less is more.\" I got Emilio's Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries, and I remember enjoying the meal, but the burger itself was not particularly memorable - I think all the bold ingredients just over-powered each other (buttermilk fried chicken, jalapeno bacon, huge chunk of mozzarella, guac, lettuce, tomato, onions, poblano pepper mayo) instead of complimenting each other. I'd be willing to give this place other chance by ordering a different item, but with so many other good burger joints in Charlotte, I have a feeling I won't be coming back here for a while.",

Location: Right off of Johnston Rd/521. You'll find plenty of parking spots!   Layout: Wider and much flatter than the East Blvd. location. It was still quite busy during a Sunday afternoon lunch but not nearly as packed in as their other location. The patio (covered in the cooler months) is a nice addition, too! The bar also looks quite spacious.   Menu: The same delicious burgers and sandwich concoctions you're used to. My favorite is the Frenchie...amazing grilled Granny smith apples, turkey burger and smothered with Brie and a touch of special mayo. Get it with a design your own salad...chipotle ranch dressing FTW. Their milkshake and beer lists are pretty extensive, too!   Service: Attentive, helpful and fairly quick even when they're busy!   If you get a chance, always ask about their burger of the day...it's usually a winner. It's good to be bad...daddy's.",

I stopped ordering online and started dining in more often because i really like their food but they always get my order wrong even though my english is on point and i always repeat it 2 or 3 times. Then she brought it i told her and she said i heard you said black beans when she specifically repeated black olives after me and asks me if im allergic. Allergic or not i know what i ordered and if im dining in its because im starving so why would i return my food so you can get it right the second time?  I ordered Daddys Nachos without BLACK OLIVES, now im picking out the olives instead of enjoying my dish. Thanks for the extra work. Teach your staff to pay more attention to detail or take notes while they teach themselves to have good memory, that really matters for returning customers.  On top of that, no silverware to pick the beautiful and tasty black olives that i hate so much!",

    "text": "If a consistently full parking lot means anything, this burger joint is one of the most popular in Ballantyne. In fact, I have yet to try it until today due to the consistently large crowds. What better way to try it though than with one of my fellow Yelpers, Michael W.  Comfortable seating is available both inside and out. The outside patio is enclosed and roomy. Also, available outside are a couple of comfortable benches to make waiting a little more bearable.  I went with the American Burger combo with a CYO side salad for $11.95. NC grass fed beef is also available for $2 more. My burger was larger than at most similar joints and was prepared perfectly cooked at medium. The Brioche roll was delicious  and more than merely an afterthought, as can be the case even at high-dollar burger bars.  My (CYO) Create Your Own side salad was also pretty special consisting of leafy greens, bacon, fresh avocado, black olives, red onions, apples, walnuts and feta, all topped with creamy  balsamic vinaigrette.  The other side's available include french fries of course, sweet potato fries, tater tots, or coleslaw. All of the potato items looked delicious, as did the chicken topped salad chosen by my Yelp buddy.  More then burgers are served up here, as excellent sandwiches in made-to-order salads are available.  Service was attentive and friendly, and everything looked clean. Other than parking being challenging the only other issue is the cavernous dining room tends to be noisy. But then again, the atmosphere is as much Sports Bar as it is Burger Bar, which probably is another reason for its popularity.  Oh, before I close, I do you need to sound the Beverage-Price- Gouging-Alarm as all soft drinks and iced teas are $2.75. (Meh!)  Overall, it was still a good experience though, and I will try it again with my wife.",

I mean can I enjoy my 1600 calorie burger in total ignorance and bliss? No, I can not, so I have to order the 900 calorie burger that I didn't really want to deal with the guilt and shame. Ok, I'm being dramatic. That didn't really happen. LOL! But as much as I dislike it, it prevents me from going too often and overindulging. My latest visit I had the cheesesteak and fries and it was very good. Packed with meat, juicy and loaded with melted cheese.  The fries are sooooo good and the dipping sauce just takes it over the edge.  Our server was very nice and made sure we were taken care of, our glasses stayed full and we were in and out in no time. My daughter had the bad*** burger and she devoured every bite and my friend had the burger with the fried mozzarella on it and loved it but the cheese could have been more melty and hot.  This place is great and their happy hour specials seem to be pretty decent. We wanted to try their new deviled eggs but I just couldn't bring myself to pay 5 bucks for 5 egg halves. Yikes. I mean, a dozen eggs costs like a dollar. Now, that's a killer profit margin on that so more power to them.  In closing, this place is great. The food is excellent. I highly recommend it. That is all!",

I tried the Smokehouse Burger this time (pulled pork, beef patty, pepper jack cheese that I changed to white cheddar cheese, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, and apple-bacon BBQ sauce). The onion straws were a bit soggy, but otherwise, I absolutely loved this burger! It was so packed, I could barely take a bite! All burgers come with a side, so I had tater tots, which were nicely crispy. The burger is usually $12.75, but they honored my birthday coupon, so the burger was free! Server was quick and attentive. Plenty of parking. Can Bad Daddy's get any better???!!",

It has a down to earth sports bar feel so you immediately feel at home. The menu has a good variety of things that sound appetizing that isn't just a burger (create your own salad, Chicken sandwiches, Philly cheese etc) so if you're not big on burgers you'll still find something. I ordered the \"Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids\" and my mom ordered their Philly cheese steak (more like a chopped cheese with all the Philly toppings) and we agreed that both were really good. The Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids had 6 pieces of bacon (yeah you read it right) on it!  I added an egg because eggs and burgers are a perfect marriage (mom doesn't agree ) and it made it even better. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it's definitely worth getting again. Personally the fries were the star of the show as they are handcut and fried just right (think Penn station fries) and with their signature Bad Daddy sauce it really sets them off.   If you're ever in the area I'd suggest pulling up and giving them a try. I gotta come back for the create your own salad",

We walk in and felt immediately judged by the host desk. Instead of greeting us, one of them made a comment on how there are way too many kids there tonight (while we were carrying our 2 year old). Hey thanks for the help, guess we'll find our party ourselves.   Although the waiting staff all seemed friendly, they were obviously rushed on a Fri evening and didn't care who they had to get rid of to turn the tables around. We had not 1, not 2, but 4 instances where the waitresses asked us if they could clear our table... While we were still sitting there with food on our plates! Our main waitress tried to drop off the check twice, again, while we were still eating, and we had to remind her that we were planning on ordering dessert and ice cream for our child since it came with their meal. The desserts came out pretty terrible (watery ice cream and a milk shake that had zero flavor), which were obviously done quickly instead of properly, and we were once again bombarded with a wave of staff asking if they can clear our plates. One of the waitresses literally stood at the back of the restaurant and just stared at us hardcore until we left - we felt very uncomfortable about that.  We understand this place is popular and busy, rightfully so with the yummy food, but maybe consider training on common courtesy and manners?",

Bad Daddy's has a great selection of burgers and can build your own should be in the mood to be a little different.  The great thing when you don't have a craving for a burger, hot wings are always a great option or even the salads.  Of course a beer is always required when having a burger or wings!  They have great options and local beers and you can never go wrong!  They also have multiple televisons around the area to watch all types of sports!  Definitely our \"go-to\" restaurant for any time when we are hungry!",

The Thursday drink special was pretty good - 20oz. for the price of a pint on any draught beer, with pretty good selections, not just the run of the mill american lagers.  The server (I forgot his name) was extremely helpful and made it a more positive experience.  I even told him personally that I enjoyed this visit versus the trip to the East Blvd location.    My wife and I split the Chicken Club burger w/ sweet potato fries and a small create-your-own salad.  The chicken club was well cooked with a nice sized portion of chicken, enough ham, and tasteful bacon.  A great alternative to the beef burgers even though they're known to be one of the best. The chicken club is more than enough for one person and the small salad is not enough for me.  Luckily we split the difference and was able to get a full balanced meal out of it.    And of course we couldn't leave without taking the salted caramel pretzel milkshake to go.  I'm addicted to desserts, so I couldn't stop slurping it on the way home.    I would come here again and bring others for the food, service, and specials!  Next time, I'll try a famous burger and that may provide the 5th star.",

The wait staff almost always asks you if you have any questions about the menu, explains the specials and is helpful in giving a recommendation.  They are attentive in filling drinks and the management checks on you to make sure everything is good.  The food....Oh man.  In my opinion (as well as other people) they have the best burgers in town and by far the best salads.   I love Stella's Greek Salad.  And I usually go for the Frenchie turkey burger or the Banh Mi pork purger but occasionally I stray and order beef.  There are a few servers that go well beyond the average server there.  On a recent visit, my check arrived promptly. One of the managers noticed my sweet potato fries looked funny and brought out a fresh batch. And the server brought a tea to go without even asking.    It's things like this that make a difference and influence my tip and a 5-star rating.",

Hostess was texting and looking at  her phone while talking us when we walked in but thought ehhh that's ok we'll try the food. Holy moly this was bad. Totally underwhelming. We got the buffalo tots , which lacked serious effort. My friend got the Pittsburgher ordered it medium but the burger came out mooing. We opened it up and the meat looked like it was a scoop straight out of a chopped meat container that was microwaved for 30 seconds. I went with the black bean burger which wasn't bad but not great. I think it's nice they offer a lettuce wrap. The waitress was very nice when she came over but that was fairly seldom. Overall definitely 1 star worth ...first thing we both said was that we wouldn't come here again.",

I enjoyed an amazing three-course meal at Bad Daddy's Ballantyne with great service. Our waitress suggested trying to BBQ Chicken Nachos (with grilled pineapple )that definitely lived up to my expectation and more. For my entree, I tried the Frenchie Sandwich with a turkey burger, grilled apples, Brie cheese, bacon and more with sweet potato fries. We got our meals very quickly and you could tell everything was hot and fresh. For dessert, we treated ourselves to the Peanut Butter Pie and oh...my...goodness. The pie crush tasted like a PB/Chocolate cookie and the filling was a mousse texture with chocolate drizzle on top. Typically, PB brittle is served on top but we decided to not get that. On the other end of the spectrum, their salads are also a great option with the Greek being my favorite. Overall, a great experience! Will definitely go back.",

But, alas, life just ain't that simple. I've tried about 4-5 of the burgers, and all of them left me feeling underwhelmed. Today, I got the Bad Ass Burger. The \"buttermilk fried bacon\" sounded otherworldly in theory. In practice, it was heavily-breaded bacon (?!) that just made the burger hard to handle/eat. Bruh, how you mess up BACON?!?! Felt the same way when I got the bacon burger on steroids before.   Sure, the tots (and sauce) are worth the hype, but that ain't the main attraction. The shakes were good, if a little inconsistent in terms of varying thickness / drinkability. And the times I've tried to booze up my shake have also been hit-and-miss.  The service has always been super-friendly and attentive, which almost makes me want to bump the rating up a star in and of itself. But I just can't. Feels slightly unfair to judge Bad Daddy's based on what I want it to be, rather than what it is - a decent burger + shake spot. But all's fair in love + burgers, and I'm just not that into you.",

We were his last table of the night and he was very tentative and observant.  Our drinks never went empty, our food was hot and correct (also thanks to the kitchen for that), was polite, waited until we were both finished eating before bringing our check so as to not make us feel rushed. He just did everything right and we wish there were more servers like him. What was more impressive was that while taking care of us he was also stocking up, sweeping, taking out trash, just doing things that needed to be done without missing a beat. We made sure to let the manager know how great a job he did.  The kitchen did a great job as well. Our food came out hot and in a timely manner. I ordered my burger well done and it was cooked perfectly...not overdone or burnt at all. And my husbands veggie burger was fried instead of grilled which is a great option that more places who offer veggie burgers should do since it keeps it from being mushy (also a suggestion from our server).  Everyone we encountered was nice and we enjoyed our experience here.  Great job!!",

However, I will caution anyone to drive the extra distance to go to the location on East Blvd. (Dilworth), rather than going to the Ballantyne location.   During my last visit, I received a burger that was over-well-done, when I asked for medium.  They replaced it with a burger that was cooked correctly, but with the wrong cheese on it. They did me right and comped the burger, plus they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer.  The manager was very nice and understanding, and he admitted that their kitchen sucks.   Bad Daddy's is still my burger place of choice; I'll just have to drive 12 miles, rather than 1.5, to have one.  11/11/12 - UPDATE - I decided to give this location another try, rather than drive 12 miles.  Big mistake.  The food took FOREVER to arrive, and when it did, they screwed up my order.  Plus, they overcooked my girlfriend's burger.  The waitress was a bitch, too.  Very unpleasant experience.  The manager is a nice guy, and he walks around the restaurant, apologizing to everyone for the awful service all day.  I can't believe they don't make improvements to the mess they have there.  Never going back.  I mean it this time.",

OK, well first of all I love classic rock and that's what they play - but at 4PM on a Saturday afternoon it's blasting like \"one last song for closing\" at a NYC nightclub closing at 3AM? Why so loud? You can't hear your lunch (or early dinner) companion. The music is so overwhelming it takes away from the enjoyment of their delicious food.   Then there is the patio to escape to on a lovely day - except these post grads take over and yell at the top of their lungs, it's all about them, them, them. What happened to common courtesy. This happened last weekend at 3:30PM or so, and everyone there dining outside to enjoy the weather and escape the blasting music inside was looking at each other disdainfully. Just a sign or two, something on the menu asking folks to please be mindful of their fellow diners - it's a restaurant not a club.  Staff is quick, know their stuff - no doubt they'd like to say something, but these folks rely on tips for their income, and they don't want to jeopardize that, nor can they afford to. Bad Daddy's doesn't need rowdy students/post grads to bring in the business. Their quality speaks for itself. And I'm guessing the servers rake in a helluva lot better tips from the more mature couples (unless they get P.O.'d from the inconsideration \"hell raisers\". \"Nuff said?\"",

My typical order is a Western Burger (buffalo burger, barbecue sauce, cheese) without onion rings. They cook it at the minimum to a warm pink center, which is perfect for me. A lot of restaurants will only go well in NC since NC requires beef that is not ground at the restaurant to be at a certain temperature. The buns are soft and good, and the thick burgers are juicy and delicious.  Service, I've found, is always very good and consistent. Jared (or Jarod?) goes above and beyond to make sure his customers are happy. My mom once got onions (which she doesn't like) on her burger. A manager took it back and literally removed the onions from the bun and gave it back. Jared asked several times to take it back and then we ended up with a free milkshake. That's customer service and that's what keeps me coming back. Exceptional.  It can get really busy during the work week at lunch, and dinner is pretty crowded too. Weekends are a mess as well. Essentially, every time is a mess since it's so good! Give Bad Daddy's a shot next time you're in South Charlotte!",

I have to say that the food has always been pretty good and the ingredients are fresh.    We almost always get some kind of burger and fries or tots.  I've had the fried pickles and nachos too.  The pickles are pretty good and the nachos are fair.  I have also noticed that the wait to get your food can take quite a while which can be a headache when you are there on your lunch break.  Also the price of the burger/fries combined with a drink and tip can start to get a little pricey.",

The sweet potato fries are always a winner especially w/ the spicy sauce they serve up. The chicken sandwich, not bad. The chicken was tender and had decent spice for a buffalo chicken sandwich but it was served w/ a blue cheese crumble AND ranch dressing. That's a little strange to me. Shouldn't it be an either/or? I asked for the ranch on the side and it worked out well. Again, by no means a bad experience but when I look at just burgers or in this case a buffalo chicken sandwich, I've had better elsewhere.",

You can choose fries (regular or sweet potato), tater tots, or a variety of other sides. They also have a great beer menu. If you're not in the mood for a hamburger they have a wide variety of other menu items, my wife especially likes the salads. They also have amazing milk shakes that are large enough to share. The service is friendly and fast. If you want a great burger in a fun atmosphere with plenty of TVs definitely go here. Five Guys and SmashBurger are both really good but Bad Daddy's beats both by far.",

They have a great beer selection, and good Bloody Mary and mimosa specials on Saturdays and Sundays. Service has always been good. I wish there were more options than burgers and salads though, as you are slightly limited if you're not in the mood for a burger. But if that's the case you should probably not go to a burger joint! Have yet to try their breakfast, but am really looking forward to it!",

There was a wait, but very reasonable for a Friday night at 7 p.m.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things and the food arrived pretty quickly so no issues there really.    Maybe our expectations were too high, but we weren't bowled over by the food.  We had the homemade potato chips for an ap and they were tasty.  Nothing special, but nothing wrong with them either.  I love homemade chips but these didn't wow me.   Hubs ordered the Bacon Burger on Steriods.  I think we were both envisioning heart attack on a platter (in the best possible way of course!).  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  A rather smallish burger arrived  - for $11 and with that name we were expecting something huge!  You couldn't even see the bacon unless you lifted the bun.  Chili's is serving a better bacon burger right now - larger and tastier with better bacon.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad burger, but did not meet expectations.  I went with a small salad from the Make Your Own Section.  Nice option really.  Kind of like a salad bar without having to worry about the food coming into contact with every one in the place.  Good choice of toppings.  Very reasonable price.  For various sides we had the fries and the sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries were good, regular fries were not great.  They kind of had a weird taste.  My fry loving 7 yr old wouldn't eat them.   A first.  All in all, I think there are better places for a burger in Charlotte - 131 Main, Five Guys - even Chili's come to mind.",

    "text": "I decided to try them out for lunch because they got a lot of recommendations for their salad. However, looking at their menu, I could not resist a burger. Being that I am on a very low carb diet, I decided to go with a lettuce wrapped Bacon Cheeseburger with a Small Salad on the side. It was hard though, because I REALLY wanted Texas Toast! It looks yummy in other pictures. Walking in to pick up my order, being my 1st time, I didn't know where to go. But standing there at the podium, waitresses would look at me and keep doing whatever they were doing. It wasn't a lot of people in the place at the time & so this annoyed me. I just decided to go to the bar since that's where most restaurants serve pickup orders. They were indeed able to help me there.  I'd never done a lettuce wrapped burger before so I was really nervous on how this would turn out. However, I did not regret my decision! It was delicious! I was most nervous about the lettuce being soggy resulting in a messy burger, but they give you fresh crispy lettuce. It held together fine, even when I added my sauces. Those burger pattys have so much flavor. Normally, I don't eat a lot of bacon on my food. Actually I don't eat a lot of bacon period. When I do I'd rather have it alone with grits and eggs. But that was seriously the best bacon i'd ever tasted. It was sliced to the best thickness and fried perfectly. It had a hint of sweetness and you could taste the apple smokiness in it. I took it off my burger and ate it separately after I finished. Saved the best for last. Don't judge me. I mean what are ya'll doing to that bacon? Can I order a supply? I could eat that bacon all.... ok I went on a bit of a bacon rant. Let me snap out of it. So out of curiosity I tried the Garlic Mayo, BBQ Sauce & the Bad Daddys Sauces. Then they were all so good I couldn't decide which to put on my burger. So I stared at my burger for 5 minutes evaluating my taste buds. I ended up going with the Garlic Mayo & BBQ. But I took the Bad Daddys Sauce home to eat with my chicken breast I cooked for dinner. Can't let good sauce go to waste.   On to the salad which was also delicious. I've definitely found my new salad spot. You can choose up to 7 toppings free and after staring at the list for 5 minutes, I finally used all 7. I felt like if I didn't, I was wasting food. I mean some people want 8 toppings and here I am struggling to choose 7. The nerve of me! I would not let my people down. I loved the Broccoli in it. It's like they blanched it with a little flavor because it wasn't completely raw and was tasty! That little salad gave me everything I needed! It was so fresh & that balsamic was one of the best i've ever tasted! Bad Daddy's definitely has a new regular customer!",

    "text": "I came here because my dad is in town and he wanted a turkey burger. So I used good ole Yelp to find a place with good reviews for their turkey burgers. This place seemed to have the best reviews.   I visited on a windy Saturday in April. It's a pretty small diner. Lots of families with kids. A little noisy. They had wifi which is a plus.   We both ordered the turkey burger aka \"The Frenchie\". Dad had his in a bowl (no bread bcuz of the diet he's on) with grilled onions that looked disgusting and he said the tasted disgusting as well. Fresh fruit was his side (nothing exciting about that).   I had The Frenchie without the garlic mayo. It had Brie, bacon, onions, tomato, lettuce, Apple, and pickle. I took off the onions and the burger was delish. Meat was crispy on the outside just how I like my burgers and the flavors from the Brie, Apple, bacon and pickles complemented each other well. I upgraded my fries to the truffle fries (extra $2). These were my least favorite truffle fries I've had. They were fresh cut which I love, but pretty much flavorless (you'll need to add salt). The best part of the fries was the creamy truffle aioli. I dipped my fries and burger in it. Tasted great on both.   All-in-all the meal was just ok and for the two burgers and two waters the bill was a little over $25. It's rather pricey and the food and atmosphere wasn't worth the price.",

But it was greatly overshadowed by the poor service we received.  Josh was our server.  He was very inattentive and seemed to be working more at the bar than with his many tables.  Being a server myself, I like to give the person the benefit of the doubt, but the longer we were there the worse it got.    I'm am by no means saying that I won't go back for the food, because it was really good, but the service left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Another thing to mention is that the place was filthy.  The floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months and some of the tables sat dirty for a long time after the customer had left.",

One of the other options I looked at had buttermilk bacon on it. I tried a bite from my friend and holy smokes it was ridiculously good because the breading on it was flavorful and crisp. His burger was piled so high with the buttermilk bacon, he couldn't fit it in his mouth. And let's not forget the milkshakes. I had the Elvis, with the right mix of peanut butter and chunks of banana. When the shake is first served, you definitely need a spoon to eat it because it's so thick.

Still have a special place in my heart for the original location, but this location in Ballantyne is just as good and I'm sure the people in South Charlotte like not having to go too far to get some delicious burgers.  Local craft beers are on tap here and there's even a Bad Daddy's Amber, which is quite good.  Nothing beats a burger and a beer after a long day.  Our last visit here, we had a rather large group and a baby, but the hostess gave us a booth and added a table.  It was worth the wait and it's nice to know they are really there to help you have a great experience every time.  Our server was very good, even though we were such a big group... we always had refills and our orders were cooked to perfection.  My personal favorite is the Sam I am... but all the burgers are quite good.  You can even build your own... or swap our turkey or a bean burger instead of beef in any of the prefixed burgers on the menu.  I am also partial to tater tots... but any of the sides here are great.  Overall a great place to get a burger if you find yourself in the South Charlotte area.  Probably my one complaint is the parking lot in the shopping center (shared by other businesses and the Harris Teeter).  Once you get parked though... clear sailing to burger heaven.",

I sought sanctuary at the bar.  The wait staff and bar tender operate on high speed, so is hard to ask questions.  It is a burger and shakes place and that is the main thrust.  I got a burger, a Kobe burger, onion straws and iced tea.  The burger was nicely cooked and juicy, but, frankly, nothing special.  Thought the Kobe beef would be, but I don't think you gain any more flavor than a regular burger.  The onion straws were mostly onion bits/crumbles.  Not good and it was like getting the dregs from the container where they are dumped out of the fryer.  The guy next to me said, \"You should have gone with the fries.\"  I agree and pass that recommendation on to you.  The burgers are good and it is a popular place, so go on off times.  As I mentioned, the lunch crowd was manic. Will go back to give it another try as it has potential to be a fav place.",

This week, we chose the Ballantyne location of Bad Daddy's. Not that there's anything wrong with the Dilworth location except for the parking situation.  We were seated inside after we arrived just after opening. A nice sunny day with a good breeze, it was perfect. Great service from a friendly waitress who kept my friend's water glass filled. I had a beer - Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale. It was excellent.  I took the waitress' recommendation for my burger and got the Pittsburger. It was awesome. Fully dressed with American cheese and topped with shoestring fries, it was a mouthful of cardiac arrest deliciousness. I ate the whole thing. And the excellent onion rings on the side.  Not terribly expensive - maybe a bit much for lunch - but a very tasty and very filling meal. I wouldn't recommend it on a work day as I had to head home for a nap. Mmmm...",

Our total bill (no alcohol) came to $80 (for a family of 5) which seems overpriced for burgers, no matter how good they are. The place is crowded, and the wait staff seems most interested in getting you out the door as quickly as possible, and not really providing good service. Again, no  issues with the food, but I think I will stick with 5-Guys from now on so I don't have to deal with a surly wait staff and an overpriced meal.",

When the burger arrived w/cheese that I did not order, I proceed to scrape off the cheese and noticed that the buger had an odd color. The outside had a pale pink color with no grill/cooking marks. It was not red on the inside so i went ahead and ate it and thought it was cold but chalked that up to the condiments.   I mentioned to my son on the way out that was one of thee worst burgers I'd ever had. He said his was awful as well.   At 10 oclock that night I was bent over a toilet vomiting.

While the restaurant was not busy as you would think it would be the server was not very attentive. The food was loaded with salt, it was like eating a salt lick. The burger was overly salty along with the fries. Not to mention that I was sick for 2 days after eating there starting the night I ate there. They must add lots of seasoning to the meat to preserve the freshness and have the ability to keep unused meat longer. I was very disappointed since the last time I ate at one of franks scabelis restaurants the food was so good.  So if salt is an issue do not eat here. Sadly I will not be back.",

From the nachos, to the amazing Mac and cheese appetizers, to the fresh salads with scatch made dressings, to our favorite the Sam I Am, a beef burger loaded with pesto, Rosemary ham, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, you can't go wrong. I recently decided to try a new burger and went with the frenchie on a whole wheat bun. It was a turkey burger with Brie, granny smith apples, applewood smoked bacon, garlic mayonnaise and it was awesome, but for me the part that made it so good was the waitress. She could see me trying figure if I wanted to try it, and because it happened to be one of her favorites, she stood behind it. \"No worries, if you don't like it, I'll get you your favorite.\"   They have a fully stocked bar, great beer options, and the best milkshakes, spiked or not.   Of course when you try a new restaurant you may want some help with the menu, at BD they always ask if you've been before, they want you to take your time and enjoy whatever you choose. It's a simple menu, but there are so many options, even the picky eaters can find something to make their own, due to the burger options alone: portabella cap, veggie, beef, turkey chicken, pork, and I even believe I'm forgetting one! Try it, you can't miss, but be prepared to wait a  a moment or two, because it doesn't matter the day or the time, Big Daddy's is always busy!",

    "text": "I had heard great things about this place but was left very disappointed. I was impressed with the menu and the variety of options. I ordered the Western burger, cooked medium and at $11.50 for a burger i had VERY high expectations. After a VERY long wait for my burger, when it finally arrived it was so over cooked it was almost burnt around the edge. And the fries were extremely soggy! A very unappealing meal. You'd think a 'burger' place would have perfected how to cook a burger correctly, especially for that price.  Give me 5 Guys any day, for 1/2 the price!",

    "text": "I have heard a lot about this burger place and I decided to check it out for dinner one day. I decided to get the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich. This is a buttermilk fried chicken breast topped with guacamole, jalapeno bacon, onions, tomato, lettuce, mozzarella and poblano pepper mayo. With the sandwich I got a side of fries. The chicken sandwich is unique and it mixes different flavors and they seem to go well together. The chicken is cooked well. To be completely honest I wasn't very impressed with the sandwich. I feel like it had all the right ingredients but the flavors didn't come through in the sandwich. The one impressive ingredient in the sandwich was the poblano pepper mayo. It was unique and tasted really good. The fries were good but nothing special. I have tired some of the other things there and I would recommend eating there starters before getting a sandwich. Also, I would recommend trying the chipotle ranch dipping sauce. The chipotle ranch is one of my favorite dips to have with their fries. Overall a sandwich, fries, and a drink will run you about $13.",

Another draw back on the restaurant was it was way too loud!! All the hard surfaces and the open ceiling cause this problem.",

    "text": "I really enjoy eating at this place. My date and I were pretty big fans of Red Robin (which this place reminds me of in alot of ways) so when we stumbled upon it we were happy and hesitant at the same time to see if it would measure up to our expectations. But it did not disappoint,  I've always gotten great service, the menu has a good variety of specialty burgers & sandwiches (if you don't like those you can always make up your own) The sides work well with the mean (accept those onion crisps they look like they belong on a salad but a poor substitute for onion rings my only disappointment) But they usually have great drink specials and even offer up a few deserts that I never have room for because the burgers are quite plentiful. They also have TV's if you want to catch a game and a little out door area as well so it's caters well to all types. I would certainly recommend folks looking for something unique and tasty to head over to the burger bar, it's a safe bet :-D",

The burger tasted great, but it was very messy and didn't hold together at all. Even though it was messy I would go back in a heartbeat to get another.",
