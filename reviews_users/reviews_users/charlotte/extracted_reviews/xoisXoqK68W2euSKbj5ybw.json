He didn't rush me and was helpful with sizing for a group.    I asked them to deliver it at a certain time and he was here ON THE DOT.  In person he was even more kind and considerate than he was on the phone.  The pizza was great, the salads were fresh and their dressings were delicious.  Thanks for making my little staff so happy today!",

The marinara  sauce  to dip the garlic knots in had no taste. Everything was really terrible !!!!   Then I  paid with a debit card. They said hold on. If you wanna give a tip enter the amount now. I felt kinda uncomfortable when they asked for a tip. Especially on a walk in order to go. I can see if I sat in their restaurant and ate. But it was a take out order. That's kinda rude to ask a customer for a tip. On a take out order. I hated everything about this place.  I'm never going back there. And I work at a local hotel. I'm going to tell all of my residents never to order from this place.  $20 for a medium pie and 4 garlic knots. Never Again....",

I ordered Spaghetti with sauce and I felt like I was back at the hospital in the 1980's. Yes, the spaghetti tasted like hospital food. It was greasy, and not tasteful at all. The salad was a few iceburg leaves, with a half assed tomato. My mother had a pre-cooked and frozen lasagna. It was not cheap, and for 2 dinners and tip the bill came out to almost $40.00.... no way, never again. The owners had expressed that they were from Europe, but I know food as bad as this is not served in Europe... maybe that's why they are here.",

Their pizza is amazing and has an extra bit of something in it that I can't put my finger on, but it's special and they give you giant slices. The garlic knots are EVIL (in a good way).. buttery and garlic-y, get some extra napkins for these awesome rolls and get a mint if you are heading back to the office. :)   The staff is super friendly. I feel like I'm visiting family when I go in there. If you've been here you know what I'm talking about. The son will pick on you and make friends, but also give great service, and the mom is a super sweet lady that is very nice to talk with.   We've had a bit of everything and you always leave full, satisfied and happy. My friend  and my dad both said they had the best philly cheese steak in their lives here.   You don't want to go here for white table dining since it's a tiny place on mint-hill rd, but if you are nearby and want a fantastic lunch or a casual dinner, you will be glad you did.

We've had other pizzas since our first time here and we ALWAYS end up comparing them to Primavera Pizza. ALL of the others fall short. But let's talk Garlic Knots!!! Someone's review called them \"crack\". Really? Over garlic knots? YES! YES! YES! You've GOT to try them to believe them. I've found myself planning what to cook for dinner just so I have an excuse to stop and get some to go WITH dinner!!! Warning...be sure & get enough or there WILL be some elbowing at the dinner table.",

    "text": "Catching up on reviews finally.  Ok, 1st, anybody claiming this is NY Style Pizza has no clue what NY Style Pizza is.  Period. 45+ years of eating ny pizza and every other pizza/cuisine/food in NY, in the south and all over the world, I think I know what Im talking about.  While not NY Style...not even close honestly. It is quite good/unique. Especially here in the south.  It reminds me more of being in France and entering in to one of many establishments that advertise 'NY Style Pizza'.  Nope, not 'NY Style'. But still quite good. Quite unique. Easy to find this 'style of ny pizza' overseas. But hard to find here in the U.S.  It does have the the thin quality, but thats where the similarity ends.   The crust, cheese etc, is far more European in style.  No stretchy globs of mozzarella. No need for an extra napkin to soak up the wonderful NY liquids dripping off your slice.  A soft, flaky very European crust, Almost pastry like. Widespread overseas, but rare here in the U.S, especially in charlotte.  Its not a chain. It is a mom and pop shop. Mostly Mom (nora) and her son. Nora is from Europe. Hence the European flair to their food.  Both terrifically nice friendly enjoyable people. Whether your a regular or first timer, you will be treated the same...as family....  The location is good...sort of hidden...but sort of not...easily and quickly accessible once you know where they are.  To the food which is of course the main thing. No, as said, not NY Style Pizza and anybody who says it is NY Style has no clue. Its 'European NY Style', which is vastly different then wandering around Brooklyn eating True NY Style Pizza.  But that doesnt mean its not good. In fact, I would rec anybody go there and give it a try without hesitation.  There are not many pizzas like this available here.  I personally would like a little more flavor in the sauce. With that, Id give 5 stars. Just a tad bland....But, that flaky, pastry crust is awesome and I suspect if you asked for a tad more zest, they would accommodate you, and if not, the crust alone makes it a regular stop on your weekly dining trip that you, your kids and family should greatly enjoy and look forward to.  The Calzones, Stromboli, Rolls and etc are good. Rather large (you wont leave hungry) and of course like everything they make, its all homemade. The above have the same delicious European pastry like homemade goodness the pizzas have.  The main dishes, again, all 4 star...all delicious...pasta is typically al dente as all pasta should be....The garlic knots are quite good, close to 5 stars....  The only thing holding me back from an overall 5 star rating is the rave reviews for the 'best philly cheese steak' in NC reviews.  OK, so Im spoiled. I expected more. Mind you, I was not disappointed, I just had my bar set too high. It was a 3.75-4 star sub just based on the bread and meat. I just expected a fuller, heartier sub with the green peppers, onions and etc to stand out, not be hard to find/taste.  However, I also know the next time I order the Philly Sub, which I will soon, I will ask Nora for xtra Green peppers/onions etc to be softly/quickly sauted, not cooked fully and toss them on, and no doubt they will do it and my rating on the philly will likely jump to 5 stars.  If you want True NY style pizza/pasta/dishes, go elsewhere. If you want a delicious Italian pizza/food/bread/meal etc, with a great European flair thats hard to find in this area, head on up to hwy 74/matthews township, visit this place and you'll find it and be glad you did.  as a quick side note, the reason this place has the 'European Flair', is because of Nora's History...its where she's from, her travels and trevairs (sp?) experiences are what make this place a special gem all should try.....You likely won't be disappointed and in case you are, they likely wont let you leave until you are fully satisfied....When everything you make/cook/serve is homemade, there is a lot of leeway to change alter things to your liking....  They will ensure you leave happy and satisfied and looking forward to your next visit...  Happy Eating",

I am giving the pizza joint 1 star because service, cost and food go hand in hand. I got a small pizza and it cost over $25 bucks?!?!? The food was good but not $25 worth. I think it's a rip off. I'm probably not going to buy there again not because of the cost or taste but because of the air head worker.",

The service seemed organizationally challenged, what with only a pleasant lady from Central Europe and a young guy to answer the phone, cashiering, cooking, taking orders, greeting, getting take out orders ready and serving ... all this in no particular order. Got to admit the Virgo in me was amused , it was like watching the traffic in Rome.     I had two slices for lunch (see the pix) it was OK , certainly NOT five stars or excellent in any way. It's nothing like NY pizza, tastes leaner and the dough is different as well - too sweet with no salt.  To give it credit the crust wasn't spongy like Brixx @ Foxtrot or the cardboard like from the so called Brooklyn pizza parlor but that amounts to showering it with faint praise, let's say it wasn't bad, the tomato sauce was OK and in my opinion it needed extra cheese.   I'll probably try this place for dinner one of these days,  I just wish people wouldn't hype their local hole in the wall so much all it does is lead one to disappointment.  REALLY!",

    "text": "So I was out at the Carolina Beer Temple, and my friend and I got a craving for pizza.  We broke out our smart phones and we decided to give Primavera Pizza a try.  I had always seen it from the road but never had an excuse to stop in.  Man, I didn't know what I was missing!!  At first glance, the place doesn't really wow you with a great location or fancy decor, but what really shines is the food.  We were looking for pizza by the slice and we were definitely surprised.  I am so used to places just having the normal cheese and pepperoni ready to heat up, but this place has cheeses waiting and then you can customize it with toppings for and extra 0.25 a topping.  And they DO NOT skimp on the toppings either.  I had two slices of bacon sausage pizza and there was bacon and sausage all over it - you could barely see the cheese.  The crust was definitely unique and buttery.. I even ate the end crust too, usually it is just the vessel that delivers the  cheesy goodness into my stomach, but here it definitely adds to it.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and took a table.  Very casual here, the guy got us drinks and then took our order.  It looks like this place handles a lot of take out since a lot of people were in and out while we were eating.  I only got to experience the place once, but it looks like you can order at the counter and then take a seat as well, there is no real formality to it all, just lets the food speak for itself which is great.  Totally family business... mom and dad in the back cooking it felt like while the son was delivering pizzas and taking orders.  I will definitely try to come back to try their hot subs or other Italian offerings.",

Stuffed with four types of cheese: mozzarella, provolone, parmesan, and ricotta. Garlic sauce + I requested to add spinach. Yummy. Marinara sauce on the side was amazing. Cannot forget to mention the dough being used, which is the same dough their pizza's made from. This calzone was served very hot, and as much as I wanted to hold it up and eat it like a burrito, I had to use a fork. I absolutely love this ma and pop place. Location is inconvenient and you'd never think to stop in or ever know this place exists the way it's tucked away off 74. Staff is extra friendly, and the same lady knows everything I've ordered so far. Please also try their pizza rolls, cheese pizza, European burger, and Philly cheesesteak. The Philly cheese is arguably up there for best in the area. Next to Bisonte, this is my secondary go to pizza spot in town.",

I thought it was going to be a typical pizza dining experience, some kind of takeout that I wasn't going to remember. The sign on be outside where they have the other store names just said \"Pizza.\" I looked at the prices and I whispered to myself, \"Yikes.\" Their pizzas were like $15-20 for a large one or two topping so I passed on that. I realized I haven't had an authentic calzone before so I decided on getting the spinach calzone.  The woman that asked what I wanted had a very authentic Italian accent- it made me feel like I was in a close-knit family shop that had been in the business for a while :-)  The calzone came in this small box and was about $9. A little pricey, but I figured it was going to be good. I opened the box up when I got outside and I saw the size of that thing! It was HUGE. I took a bite with the marinara sauce that they included and it was extremely delicious. The parmesan inside was baked into the cheese and I could definitely taste it through the bread and the spinach.   I'm coming back next week and getting the broccoli calzone next, I'm soooo excited to stuff my face again haha.",

Unique crust...very light and almost flaky. Sauce was also unique and toppings were plentiful. Really one of the best pizzas we've had in a long time. We had the meat lovers and added mushrooms...may need to find a reason to come back through just for the pizza.  If you live near here...it's a more than worth a try! Highly recommend!",

The crust was very good and had good flavor.  The sauce was decent. I prefer more of a sweeter sauce and no oregano. The cheese mixture they use is average.  It's not a high quality cheese but good enough.  We also had the garlic.knots which were veryyyyy good.  The garlic sauce they use to top them off is amazing.  We also ordered an Italian hoagie.  The bread was good, the meats were not of high quality and the italian dressing again was average.  For a local pizza place to go to once in a while that would be ideal.",

Take it from someone that has run restaurants since college, this is amazing and family, kid friendly too and right up the street from downtown Matthews and independence blvd.  Bravo PRIMAVERA PIZZA,  my family and I love it!  We will be back",

They were very nice on the phone and polite but sadly there delivery area stopped at the next road over.  I explained it was only one road over but he said it was too far.  Maybe we will try to go to the restaurant because I have seen good reviews of their food.  UPDATE: My wife decided to go and pick up the pizza and wings.  I will update again after dinner.  UPDATE: My wife said the place looked good and the owners were very nice.  Pizza was very good.  Thin crust with a little thinker crust, just how I like it.  Also had an order of wings.  The buffalo sauce was good an spicy.  We enjoyed it and will make a trip to the restaurant at some point in the near future.",

The crust isn't too chewy, you bite through it.  Maybe they don't over knead their dough. Whatever it is, this is probably the best crust I have ever had! I'm so glad this isn't my hometown or I would eat too much!",

I ordered a simple plate of French fries but was treated to a plate of grease soaked potato things. My wife ordered the club sub which was poor.  My daughter in law got the pizza which was marginal at best. My son had a Philly sub which led to some kind of gastric exorcism later that night. The food was just terrible, but the attitude of the staff is what really took the cake. They seemed to not care about anything we brought to their attention. This apathetic stance if what we seemed to notice the most.  Just a poor excuse of how employees should act. I would avoid this place like the plague.",
