Really really terrible coffe that tasted like it was from my works nasty coffee machine. They need to have a french press and some signature dish. The eggs Benedict was bland and lm not sure they toasted the English muffin. The ham was even odd. I ordered the muffin as a side and serioulsy spit it out. I was told it was blueberry but it defiantly wasn't. Stick to there regular menu.",

The wait staff did leave some to be desired with the service, there were times where I waited a while just for another glass. When you think wine shop, you think ready to pour, not so much here. But I'd definitely stop in again perhaps it will be better. Cheers!",

Jon Sheesley , the Manager had talked with me a couple of times over the last three months and helped me plan and execute the MOST fantastic shower! . We also had a waiter who was so helpful and knowledgeable - Rich Williams ( I would ask for him if you were in the restaurant. The food was fantastic, we had Crab Cakes, Tuna Tartare in little Cones, Flatbreads, Brushettas, and Calamari!  We were allowed to decorate the tables and bring in our own added touches. I would highly recommend this for any event you would need a private room for. They can hold up to 35 or 40, we had 26 and were quite comfortable. It is consistently good as a wine shop and now we know its great as a private venue also!! Kudo's to Jon and Rich!!",

The food is quality and the staff has been significantly upgraded over the years. I have no problem telling you now that they know who we are and take VERY good care of us every time we come in. In all it's made for a consistent choice for an every week way to have good meal and a great glass of wine or beer.   Beyond the fact I think their response to my initial review was very  disappointing....  I would actually update to give them 5 stars if they just had more vegetarian / vegan choices for my wife AND they offered the tacos all day ;-)",

Of course the wine and beer selections are amazing!    I visited this past Sunday for brunch and was very excited to try the Bloody Mary bar.  I will admit I didn't think about the fact that they didn't have liquor and sake would be used for the Bloody Mary, which turned out pretty good.  That said the \"bar\"  was disappointing.  They had 3 jars with okra, string beans and asparagus that you picked out with a fork laying out.  Then a bowl with lemon and lime wedges, one with regular olives and another with bacon chunks.  There wasn't celery, cheese or meats like salami etc.  All the items had to be dumped in your glass because they didn't have any toothpicks.    I would suggest not calling it a Bloody Mary bar and instead advertise they serve \"a\" Bloody Mary with a small topping table.",

The manager apologized and brought the ranch. Then he came around and said \" I reviewed the tape and my server has been around numerous times to check on you. So, I simply said so you're calling me a liar. He said well, I reviewed the camera and yes she has checked back in with the two of you and you both were in deep conversation. My mother raised me right, so if someone speaks I answer no matter how deep the conversation. He said, so is there anything else I can get for you? Yes the check please, since I have never been so disrespected in my life. I work in customer service myself and when a customer complains, I take it as a learning opportunity and not personal. I will always accept positive and negative feedback without taking anything personal. Being a manager for a major company, I'm always looking for feedback on my people to help them and myself grow. It's unfortunate that this manager took it so personal and called his returning customer a liar. I will never be back nor would I recommend this place to anyone. It is clear to me after tonight's experience that they don't care about paying customers but more about the employee.",

The waitress never checked on us or let us know what was going on with our food. We had other business to attend to during lunch hour but couldn't because we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food! This is ridiculous for lunchtime. When we asked what was going on, they told us our food was after the large party. I think there was a mix up but all we got was a \"Sorry\". Definitely lacking a customer first attitude. If they food had been worth it that would be one thing, but it wasn't. The special quiche was bland and disappointing. The salmon sandwich was also bland and disappointing; it needed some sort of sauce or livening up. The truffle fries were good. Everything lacked seasoning and salt. Our table didn't have any salt (and of course the waitress didn't ask if we needed anything until we were almost done eating.) The grinders/ salt shakers were so clogged we couldn't even get the salt out. Normally I wouldn't complain about piddly things like that but the whole experience was just so annoying at that point. We had to rush through our food and beg for the check to finally escape! Usually an experience like this ends with some token of apology so that you'll feel good about giving them another try but nada. Phew! We will NOT be going back!",

The truffle goat cheese fries are great, the ahi tuna is delish (the sauce has a pinch of wasabi in it), the flat breads are more like personal sized pizzas rather than the traditional flat breads that I was expecting.  The cheese plate presentation is a bit odd.  I ordered 2 cheeses and 2 meats and it came on a large, square plate with 4 individual plates within in the larger 1.  There was tzatziki sauce with it, place oddly on top of 1 of the smaller plates...no crackers???  The waitress did bring out focaccia bread (which was good by the way) & oil but I don't believe that was for the cheese plate as I saw everyone getting that bread bowl.  I was expecting crackers and a cheese board rather than this oddly large platter.  Planet Oregon wine is GOOD GOOD GOOD!  We bought a bottle home with us!    Our waitress Jordan was polite and VERY knowledgeable...attentive too!  My husband and I went for dinner around 7:30 on a Saturday and was told that the wait was 30 mins. we opted to sit at the bar (which is fine with us, we usually find our way to the bar eventually anyway! :)).  We noticed that the crowd started to die down about 8:30, 9 (note to self in case we come with a larger party and need a table).  This place is basically in our backyard, I expect to be here a lot during patio season!",

Once we were sat, our waitress approached both tables on either side of us but completely ignored us. When she finally got around to our table, she said I'll bring you all some water. (What if I don't want water!) My husband quickly spoke up and said can you tell what beers are on tap? She said, we have hundreds... Just stand up and go over to the beer area and grab what you want. He said, but do you have a list of what you have on TAP? She said, uhhh yeah and rattled them off as fast as she could and was gone.   I understand being busy.. A simple greeting and smile would have stopped the clock and made us feel welcome. Especially when she is being semi attentive to everyone else around us.   Needless to say, we took our business to River Bleu. We sat outside and our waitress was absolutely amazing. We tipped her very well and will steer clear of The Wine Shop.   I'm in the service industry and you can't expect people to pay more for less... Period.",

My friend goes there often, and she swears by the truffle fries. Unfortunately we ate so much during brunch that we didn't get to eat anything but a small order of manchego cheese ($6.50 - 2 good size slices with bread and oil/balsamic)  Since I impromptu gave up alcohol for 40 days, it was challenging to hang out at a wine place. Luckily they have a lemongrass non-alcoholic frizzy drink that was quite yummy (but very gassy) as well as other natural soda/fancy water options. They have a good amount of wine by the glass to choose from, average $9 for a decent pour.   The lady behind the bar was very nice; she made good suggestions and was overall attentive.

My husband and I decided that out of all the brunch places in Charlotte we decided to celebrate here. Upon arrival, no one opened the door like they usually do. When we walked in, only two out of ten or so tables had people at them. Since the Panthers game was on, and the woman that plays music on the keyboard was presently doing so we chose to sit inside instead of outside like our usual. All the open tables were dirty, so while the staff was cleaning some up, I went to check out there vast drink selection for the umpteenth time (not a bad thing I'll add). Once we were seated and ordered our drinks, mimosas and waters, the waitress never asked for our ID's, neither mine nor my husbands, maybe then she would've noticed it was supposed to be a celebration. The whole time we were there, she never once refilled said beverages. Neither the adult kind, or just the simple H2O. The brunch we each ordered, salmon eggs benedict and spinach rock-a-feller pizza, came out after two other tables came in and their orders were ordered, and delivered (just saying-everyone knows we notice this, and don't enjoy it). By the time I was done eating my meal and had at least 1/2 left, looking to take home left overs, and my husband was hunting for a check, our waitress was busy chatting up her only other table that wasn't even done eating, for no less than 10 min, no exaggeration. We ended up asking another waitress for a to-go container and the bill. She got both, our waitress kept chatting.  To say we were frustrated by the end of our visit was an understatement. The food was great, as usual, the service unfortunately left much to be desired.",

They have a great selection of wine behind the bar, but additionally an array of craft beers in the coolers that customers can enjoy; reasonably priced. After our experience, we were puzzled in regard to why we hadn't visited The Wine Shop earlier. Staff was polite, knowledgeable, and attentive. We will definitely be back, and recommend to our friends. Keep up the great work!",

Walked in the door, hostess has just say the last low table. We had our 2 year old with us who can sit at a low table with a seat or high chair, but not a high top, that's dangerous. The hostess asked if we could sit at a high top. Really? The hostess refused to ask the young group that just sat to switch with us for a high top. She wouldn't even ask! there were more high chairs against the wall than there were low tables. We had to leave and go elsewhere. We will not be giving our business here or any other branches. Find a more accommodating hostess and table setup! You missed out on a lot of money today and here on out.",

Husband ordered a sandwich that the highlight was jalepeno bacon, but bacon was missing on his panini.  But food was still very good.  Will go there again and see if it was just an off day.",

The servers are friendly and attentive, the wine selection is amazing, and the food is also consistently good. I was expecting the quality of food at a wine shop to be mediocre at best, but I was wrong.   An added bonus is the good music that's always on rotation here (Placebo, Portishead, Radiohead, etc - yay!)  Come here when you're in the mood to unwind with a glass of wine and/or food. Get a patio seat if the weather permits (oh, but if you're sensitive to the cigar smoke, then there's a chance you'll be seated next to a cigar smoker). You'll very likely enjoy your experience.",

So far, everything is good. I had their steak and eggs last time I was there for brunch. I enjoyed it. This time, my sister ordered a glass of moscato which is typical of her. She loved it. I ordered a chocolate flavor red wine because I love red wine and chocolate. Great combination right?!! It was good for me for the 1st half of the glass. After that it was a bit too sweet and the chocolate after taste sets in. I'm not sure because I had the crab cakes and it didn't sit well together but I was done with that glass quick. Customer service was great. She was very knowledge with the wine list and check up on us often. I will go back.",

We ordered a cheese plate and it came out with a long dark hair across all the cheese. They did quickly take away the cheese and get us a new plate. My fiance ordered a fish plate and it was amazing. I ordered the rack of lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out completely raw. It was so raw that my steak knife could not cut into it. The chef came out an agreed that it was raw and was trying to explain to me why. long story short I dont care its raw. He told me that it would take some time to get another order out. As my fiance was almost finished with her meal I said no and just ordered an italian sandwich. The sandwich was unreal. the fries were unreal and the cold cuts in the sandwich were some of the best Ive had since I moved from Boston. The chef actually felt bad about the rack of lamb that he sent me a to go box with the rack of lamp i think to prove that it really is good and wanted me to try it as he felt bad i had to order something else. He was right. When it is cooked properly they probably have the best rack of lamb ive ever had. So in short they had a bad night but the service was amazing. great beer and wine selection and the food when cooked properly is out of this world.",

He's a little bit of a salmon snob, and he ate the whole thing. I had only planned on eating half my flatbread, and I ate the whole thing. Clean plate club all around!

The manager came over and did nothing, but make me feel I was at fault. Won't be back. Hope the waitress got a good tip from her BIG table. And the wine is overpriced m.",

It is casual, good wine spot without being snooty.  The menu is very fresh and good - everything is delicious.  Don't worry, not just little wine apps - you can get pasta, burgers, a flatbread pizza (try the prociutto, fig and gorgonzola, yum), truffle fries, moules frites - they have a great selection with something for any appetite or taste.  I will continue to come to the Wine Shop to enjoy a glass of wine on the patio with girlfriends or casual dinner with my honey, perfect location.  Love it.",

The upstairs is rather small, but plenty of elbow room to move. The first level is another story, you have to squeeze around the tables. I wouldn't recommend sitting near the front door there's a draft.   Food: I love the truffle fries...So delicious!! One of other favorites, The Lightly fried calamari and Crab Cakes!! Both come with a spicy remoulade! You'll love it!! I occasionally dream about it!! Hahah!! I wouldn't recommend ordering the margarita pizza. The White Pizza is definitely a better choice!!! Comes with chicken, mozzarella, feta, and oregano.   Parking isn't that great. Depending on the time of day you'll have to circle around to find something. They also offer Brunch. So I definitely need to swing by.",

During this time we saw multiple servers who weren't busy, FYI.  After another 5 minute wait, still no service.  We decided to leave and told the hostess why we were leaving.

When I asked about one of the wines, I was offered to have a taste, and was brought a small amount served in a regular glass. I wasn't excited about it and asked about another. I had a taste and then opted for a glass. After my meal, my bill included charges for $2.50 and $3.00 for the tastes! I was then told as purported justification that the menu lists prices for tastes, as part of wine flights, which is not what I was offered or served. I do want to say that my waitress was very sweet and helpful, and apologetic about this \"new policy.\" The manager on duty was similarly sweet and polite, and removed the charges. Still- this kind of policy, especially in a neighborhood joint, struck me as being misleading, and has effectively killed my interest in returning here.",

Check your plates.  We found them to have food underneath and on the side.  Not old but probably transferred from someone else's meal.    They usually have 5 to 7 craft brews and about 48 wines on tap. Yes, wine on tap no boxes here! Their beer selection is impressive and can be consumed on site or to go for $2 more. They also have growlers to go, WHATTT!?! Wine selection is exceptional!!!!!!  They have wine tastings on Saturdays and brunch on Sundays. Pay attention to the menu as there are certain times when food is served before and after. They have an upstairs sitting area that can be rented out as well for parties.  (Just discovered that on a whim, not well advertised.) Overall, great staff.  I think often they are over staffed with employees hanging 4 and 5 deep behind the bar creating small talk amongst each other.",

The indoor area is warm and cozy and I cannot wait to use the outdoor when the weather improves.  Obviously one of my favorite aspects about this restaurant is the wine. It isn't just the selection but also the fact that if you order wine by the glass they will bring out a sample of an ounce or two to be sure you like it before committing. They bring even more beer if you want a sample!   Everything I have sampled so far has been delicious and it has the flexibility to be a destination for a nice dinner out or a casual tapas night. Or just a place to stop by a purchase a bottle of wine while you are out shopping! Definitely check it out if you are in the area.",

When we walked into the door, we noticed that there were only a few tables occupied and one table open, so not a busy time at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night.  We were left waiting at the front for a couple of minutes before anyone came to greet us then we were sat down.  It took another couple of minutes before our waitress brought us menus and then an even longer time before the waitress came to take our order.  We ordered fried green tomatoes, a club panini and a Spaniard flat bread pizza.  We did not order any alcohol. We had water. The fried green tomatoes were presented too hot, so much so, that we almost burnt the inside of our mouths.  The panini sandwich wasn't a panini at all.  It was a warm sandwich and the bread was only toasted.  A panini sandwich is supposed to be made with a \"Panini\" maker, leaving grill marks on both sides of the sandwich and compressing the sandwich.  Then, to make matters worse, the sandwich had very little lunch meat and cheese inside of it and the Spaniard pizza didn't come with the grilled onions like we ordered.  To add to our un-pleasant experience, the women's restroom was filthy dirty and is in desperate need of an over-haul.  We did tell the waitress about the issues with our food and she took 5.00 off which in our opinion, wasn't appropriate as the entire meal should have been on them.  If this place caters to those that only drink alcohol, then stop offering food because you suck at it. We will not be going back.",

    "text": "High hopes were dashed on two visits.  On March 29th and 30th (back to back nights) I stopped here with friends and both times was told it would be a 20-30 minute wait even though there were open tables.  The first night we left and went to The Casual Pint and had a blast.  The second night I offered up advice to the hostesses that they could have offered us seats outside (we are from Chicago and not bothered much by 50 degrees), a drink menu and we would have likely killed 20 minutes just browsing the wine selection.  So again, we went to The Casual Pint and again had a blast.  If I ever actually get to try this place, I will update my review.  Until then, I'm perfectly satisfied with making The Casual Pint my weekly go-to drink and food spot.",

They have beers on tap, but I didn't see these listed on the small menu board until after I had ordered. The server did not explain the offerings and the beers aren't listed on the menu (she didn't explain the wine flight concept either). Ratz.  They don't offer any vegan proteins on their menu, however since they do make their hummus from scratch, they had chickpeas and the chef gladly substituted the cheese on my salad for chickpeas. Cool.  The olive appetizer plate contains only olives with pits and it creates an uncomfortableness because you have to spit them out...somewhere. Gross.  My salad was very fresh and the focaccia bread with the dipping sauce was excellent. Fantastic.  The place did appear clean and it had a sophisticated look.   I think it would be a nice place to take a date or to chill out after work.",

We tend to come here for either an afternoon or early evening spot, before having dinner (having a few apps and wine there). We love sitting outside (weather permitting), sharing a bottle of wine, and sometimes food. Their wine options are fantastic, and not overpriced, either.  While I haven't had a lot of their food options, I have had a few. (truffle fries, cheese plates, pizza, calamari etc).  I would definitely recommend this spot to someone who wants to find a great local wine shop! (Free wine tastings on Saturday afternoons, as well!)",

Tighten that up please as it's gross. My server was a complete mess. She came over hair everywhere and looked overall like she just rolled out of bed. Didn't quite match what this restaurant is trying to portray. We ordered try brought out the food for the person I was with and waited for mine, and waited. Finally waitress came over and told me she put his in but not my order?! How is that possible since you took them at the same time? The comped my meal but the poor guy waited for mine which probably took about 12mins so his food was cold. Food was fine but waitress rarely came back. Had to keep waving her down for drink refills and waited about 25mins for my check. Then never came back, after frustration I decided to waive down another worker to cash me out. Super disappointed in the service and atmosphere, probably won't be returning anytime soon.",

Three adults, two kids, and we are pushing 45 mins of waiting for food. The tuna I ordered was very bland. The calamari was rubbery and the fried green tomatoes are much smaller than they used to be. The last time I was here the mushroom soup tasted like someone threw mushrooms in the blender and served them. My boyfriend ended up sending his back. I on the other hand, didn't want to believe it because I've always loved this place and the food. If Richard is no longer the manager, he needs to come back. Sad, sad day.",

I've been here quite a few times but I'm honestly stuck on the same things every time beacuse they're so good.   I love the quiches because I always get a different one every time I come. The truffle fries are honestly some of the best I've ever had. You have to try them when you come. Even their \"regular\" fries are delicious. Their regular fries are served with most of their sandwiches as well as their moules and frites (mussels and fries) which comes with 3 different sauces). My other staples are the crabcakes and Caesar salad...yep the Caesar salad. I ALWAYS get a Caesar salad every time I come even if it's just a half order. Why you say? They are one of the few places in Charlotte that serves a Caesar salad the way it should be served which is with anchovies. If like me you love anchovies on your Caesar you'll love theirs because they're some of the freshest I've had and they'll even give you extra if you request it.  Their wines are always great as well. They are a wine bar after all. Though I like wine I'm more of a beer drinker so my wife usually picks the wine and since she's a sweet wine drinker we always end up with a desert wine. Their Moscato Di'Asti and their sweet red Dorfelder are great choices. Their selection of craft beer is nothing to scoff at either.  Inclusive of oferything I listed above, I love coming here because the ambiance, the view and the fact that I can enjoy a great cigar on the patio along with my drink and meal or enjoy live music I'd I decide to sit inside. They also has a cozy upstairs are that is nice and tucked away from everyone else.  All in all a great vibe and a great pace that I love to frequent.",

    "text": "Went to Sunday brunch and it was very good. We had a gift card so we really went over board on the food. I ordered the crab benedict and the jalapeno and pimento cheese benedict to start. It took a little long to come out but was worth the wait. I was not to keen on the sweet potato home fries but I'm also not a big fan of sweet potato's. The jalapeno benedict obviously had a big kick so if you are not into spicy food don't order that but I loved it especially how they paired the pimento cheese with it. Then we ordered the Reuben with corned beef was very tasty although I did need to ask for an extra side of thousand island they were not very generous with that. The Bellini's were okay although I like mine more with just a pinch of peach. Same with the mimosas too much oj. I then ordered the creme brule after all that food why or how could you eat dessert right but if creme brule is on the menu I just have to order it and man I am glad I did was absolutely done perfectly! They also had a wonderful singer playing her guitar in the corner was very lovely ambiance. The only qualm I have is the service was a bit slow but I noticed there were only 4 girls working and they had a full house so maybe they were just short staffed. But the staff was very friendly and sweet. All together we had a lovely Sunday brunch and they also have a huge selection of wine to buy and take home.",

The 2 crab cakes were small enough to eat both while leaving room for an additional appetizer. I also had the flatbread chicken & spinach pizza ~ the flatbread could've been cooked a little longer but nonetheless it was delicious.   I also had a glass of a honey Chardonnay. I love red blends but the Honey Chardonnay May have to be a new edition to my personal winery.   I met some newlyweds who actually sat & ate with me.

Even after we asked for some attention, it took some time to get service.   I don't blame our waitress. She was nice and attentive. She did disappear for an extended period to wrap silverware but was overall pretty good.   Instead I think the restaurant is lacking management. Many of the waiter and waitress staff was standing around discussing personal drama. Pro tip: this really looks bad to your customers.",

Service was a tad slow on everything (getting water, receiving wine samples, getting our actual wines that we ordered, and silverware for our apps, etc) but because it was a beautiful day, we didn't mind. I'm not really sure if it's normally this slow of service (there weren't a lot of tables) or if it was just an off day. I'll be back again to try more food.

There is a small bar with about three taps, and a fairly decent bottle selection. I did not try the food, but was impressed with the overall atmosphere of the place. The waitstaff was fairly attentive, and informative. We will definately be back when we are able to try the menu along with a good beer.",

It's nice to have a place that is not just wine or food based, but both.  They also offer a cooler case of a very large selection of specialty beers.  If you need a hard to find wine, they can also help you with that and order it!  The prices aren't low but you're paying for a nicer selection of foods and atmosphere.    They often have free wine tastings on Saturdays and a musician sometimes for brunch on weekends.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the menu is pretty small.",

The service is always good and the prices are reasonable. They can be busy so call ahead is definitely recommended! We especially love sitting on their patio during the nice months! Also I'm not much of a beer drinker but their beer and wine selection is incredible. Also this area doesn't have many open restaurants on Sundays and those that are serve brunch only. We are not huge brunch fans and I appreciate that they will allow us to order many items from their lunch menu instead (they switch over to lunch at 2 PM but we tend to be there before that).

I came in a week later and just ordered a glass of it on a Wednesday afternoon and it was $19 and when I say a glass of wine, the pour was as much as you would get in a tasting....I was shocked and asked, is this a full glass of wine? The tender said  YEP.  I was a bartender in fine dining establishments for 20 years and I know what a tasting sample and a glass of wine is supposed to look like. With that said if I'm ever back in the area I might stop in but I wouldn't go out of my way to purposely go there spinning the wheel of pricing and the questionable pours.",

I gave it several chances, dining there on a few separate occasions for brunch and dinner.  Nearly every time, my company and I came away a bit disappointed.    It looks like a nice place, and when you sit down at a table it feels like a nice place.  But the wildly inconsistent service really has a negative impact on the experience here.  The food is okay and in fact we really enjoyed our brunch.  They have live music occasionally which is a nice touch.  There have been too many disappointing and inconsistent experiences here for me, and it's unfortunate because I really wanted to like it.",

I'm a bit of a food snob and don't do chain restaurants also being from south Florida finding decent places to eat around here is pretty difficult ... so in my eyes this place is awesome....",

I love the calamari, and their sandwiches and daily specials are wonderful.  Service is usually good.  When the weather is nice, you have the option of inside or patio seating, and once in a while they will even have live music.",

    "text": "I had lunch for the first time today at the Wine Shop. I normally try new places based on Yelp reviews and ratings. I eat lunch out every day and try new places every week. Yelp reviewers are normally very accurate in rating local restaurants. I tried the lunch special which was oyster tacos (I know!!) but this dish combined my love for mexican and fried oysters. The food was excellent, but the service was really really bad. The waitresses stand around talking to each other instead of waiting on patrons. They really need a new manager in the  dining room.  Countless Yelp reviews have tried to provide honest feedback to help this place improve but no one seems to be paying attention!",

    "text": "Brokenhearted: This used to be my FAV restaurant in Steele Creek Area! Not sure, but maybe new management has set in these past two months. I've been four times in the past month. (in keeping with the FAV part). Brunch: 3 weeks ago and had to be comped a wine because they were OUT of two they supposedly had, food was LONG wait and just meh. AND they had no manager working... everyone running around, with a guy from the kitchen waiting tables. Dinner: this was pretty good, food good. (Hope was renewed). Lunches: two... 45 minutes for SALAD. SALAD. no apologies, one size for the soup (noticed too late the new menu), so $16 later for soup/salad that took over an hour to order, get, eat (rushing to eat)... I'd say I've got to be done here. It's very sad. MISMANAGEMENT.... not sure if new manager or new owners. But, I will try and go over to Hickory Tavern before going here next time .",

    "text": "We have been here countless times and loved it. But tonight, even thought the food was decent, we encountered very uptight and inefficient staff. The hostess was very defensive- had an answer for everything. She would not put two tables together anywhere and claimed that every place that had two empty tables was a fire hazard if she put them together. I think she was just lazy as there was clearly no way for it to be a hazard. Every area allowed plenty of room to walk past. The staff freaked out over everything. Our youngest child has food allergies, and we often take food with us for her. They have let us do this here my  times before. But all of a sudden, tonight, it was the biggest issue. The girl actually told us it was a \" health hazard\" for the child to eat outside food at one table but not at our table. What? Does not make sense. I think they were just unhappy with us for suggesting efficient ways to seat us. Our waitress was not terribly friendly either. We will try again as this is the first time we encountered trouble. Hopefully they will fire and rehire more competent staff by the time we go again.",
