First the good: fries are excellent and wing flavors are really good. The bad: not once can they get my to go order correct. It is always the wrong wing count and flavors. It is a good idea to take the time to open your boxes and make sure you have the right order before leaving. This location is not taking the time to make sure the wings are cleaned first. I've had to remove the skin on wings because they still had feathers. I understand that one can get by every now and then but there are too many to give a pass. I will have to reserve my Wingstop fixes for when I am out of town.",

    "text": "Horrible customer service, tried to phone in my order and was put on hold before I could even say a single word. Waited for 40 minutes with not a single word or anything being said and then they hung up on me. Called again same thing on hold for quite sometime. After over an hour on hold  while I was driving, i was already almost there at the store and decided to walk in and put in my order. Based on the time I was on hold I was expecting a line out the door, that was definitely not the case, I told the lady at the register about being on hold and all they said was wellll..... I put in my order anyways and waited almost an hour for 12 wings. I heard my name called once and walked up to the register and stood there aimlessly, being completely ignored for 5-10 minutes as the lady was standing right there. And she hands me my order that was just sitting there ready for me as if I wasn't waiting there right in front of her. On top of everything else there was another lady that walked in to order some food who said she was trying to call for the past 20 minutes to phone in an order and she was standing there completely ignored and once someone who finally approached her who wasn't even working the register who seemed to be the cook told her they were closed and aren't taking any more orders. She was standing there for at least 15 minutes and not a single word was said to her. Horrible customer service, need better staff who can handle the pressure of working Saturday nights. I love wingstop but I will never visit this specific store ever again I will gladly go out of my way to go somewhere else. If I could give them less than 1 star I would because they don't even deserve that just ridiculous.",

When I asked to speak to the manager, only to alert her to the fact that there may be a problem with their online ordering system, she proceeded to talk down to me with a very rude attitude and attempt to explain that my order wasn't received in the store until a whole 30 minutes after I received confirmation. Being in the chain restaurant business myself I knew this was a complete lie but allowed her to belittle my intelligence and eventually offer me a refund. Why would I get a refund on food that I waited an hour for? Also how is it that your website can send me a confirmation right away but not send the order to the store until 30 minutes later. I know this was a lie because when ordering previously my food was ready when I walked in at the suggested 20 minutes.  I also noticed that the cashier handled food and money without scrubbing his hands, which is a definite health code violation. The manager also attempted to handle my food without washing her hands. If you want to roll the dice on your health, eat here. If attempting to order online you may want allow 50 minutes instead of the stated 20. Definitely amateur hour over there.",

    "text": "Today I went into wing stop after placing a big order over the telephone. After picking up my order in the time frame they told me it would be ready over the phone I noticed that the order was incorrect and my fries were soggy. I kindly asked the manager on duty Jasmine if she could redo my order or drop my fries again. Jasmine was very unprofessional  and rude and told me that it was not wing stop policy to redo the order even though I was not satisfied. I then asked for a refund and she replied that I was 4 minutes outside of the pick up time and wing stop does not give refunds or replace orders. She was getting loud with me in front of customers. When I asked for corporate number she replied that she didn't know it. One of the other workers told me to look on the wall. When my friend came into the store to talk about how that was not right, Jasmine replied to her \"it is what it is\" which made my friend upset because we are very loyal customers and spend at least 200 a week with them. I'm not sure if this is how Wingstop handles its customers but I felt disrespected. I did call customer service and they informed me that the district manager will call me and refund my money. It's sad that one person can make an entire corporation look bad and I hope that they train their team on effective customer service skills and how not to be rude. This was a simple fix and did not have to be escalated to the point where the on staff manager took it.",

When I received my order the fries were burnt salty and loaded with garlic/onion powder. This establishment clearly does not care how they serve their food. The wings were some what good but not to our standards. If you have time I recommend The Tavern in front of Concord Mills Mall.",

The banana cheesecake things were awful and both the mushrooms and cheese sticks were so heavily breaded that I made efforts to remove as much as possible.

The staff are polite and accommodating.  The fries are great when served hot but make sure they don't skimp on the fries. I had to ask the manager about my portion on a large once...she kindly replaced them with a bigger, fresher portion.  They are a little pricey but if you like wings, it's worth it.  Their wings are also a nice size, so you won't be mad at how small they are when you receive your food.  Overall they do okay and that is why I gave them 3 stars.  I would have given them 4 but the selfishness with the fries for the price kept them from receiving the coveted 4th star.",

    "text": "I ordered wings from Wingstop on their website on Saturday morning and paid in full for the big fight on Saturday. I was having friends and family over so I ordered 75 wings with 2 potato salads and 1 large fries. Well we live in the Ballantyne area so my husband drove 30 mins to North Tyron to pick up our order. Mind you that when I put the order in online and paid for it, I stated that we were going to pick them up at 6:30pm. My husband had to wait an additional 1 hour for our food.  When he arrived back home, and I was unpacking our food, I notice that we were short an significant amount of wings. I counted the wings and we only had 30 out of the 75 wings that we ordered. I called back over to Wingstop to inform them that our order was incomplete. We had a friend that was coming from that side of town so I informed them that he would come and pick up the rest.  Well my friend called me back to inform me that they were only going to giving us 20 of the 45 that were missing. I called back up there to ask them why they were they not completing our order only to be informed that they only thought we were missing 20. I informed them that we were missing 45 originally and that by giving is 20 more, they still owe us 25 more wings to complete our order. Well they said they give us the rest, but we would have to wait an 1hr and 30 mins. Now my friend that was doing us a favor was getting impatient because he didn't want to wait. So I told me friend that he could leave and I would deal with it in the morning.  Fast forward to Sunday morning, my husband and I both called to be informed that a manager would call us back later that evening.  Never received an call so we called again Monday morning to be informed that we would not get our completed order not would we be receiving an refund. Do to is arguing with them, for not completing my order. Also the general manager told me that I was wrong because the got our order wrong. When did this start happening in customer service industry? So in general is the food good, yes. Is the customer service great...absolutely not. I don't have the need To lie about my order, if it was right the first time, they would never have heard from me that day. It just run me that wrong way to be told that they cannot compensate me for their screw ups. I file an complaint with the police as well as the BBB.",

I have been to other locations in Texas and Illinois, and they were not even close to mastering the ingredients.  The baked beans are interesting, kind of a beer taste to the sauce.  The tenders are crispy but not way too crunchy.  The wings are traditional or boneless.  The rolls are pretty delicious.  Interesting also is the wide selection of IBC products in the cooler, if you like that more than Coke or tea.  Wingstop does have an odd way of using paper towels in place of napkins, that is a company quirk, so pack your own otherwise.",

In my old city we had over 5 wingStops and they were delicious with excellent taste and customer service... But this place is terrible from location to customer service you can barely see the place and once you go in there you will never want to come back.. The employees are scared to work because the owner watches them like a hawk like they're in prison campus it's completely sad.. Normally Wingstop gives you free extra ranch if they forgot to ring it up but they also made me pay for it and swipe my card all over again it was a disaster. I've actually met the owner once he sits in the back corner on his Apple Computer and bosses people around and the complete most ridiculous way possible",

It's Friday evening and we ordered our food which went smoothly and went to look for a table.  We walk around and there is a worker on her phone eating her meal at the big round table up front all by herself! Our family has multiple small children and could benefit from sitting at this table.  She then left all her food and belongings at the table to go make a phone call and smoke out front.  We fit our family at a tiny table until the worker went back to work.   I then had to go get our cups because they never gave them to me.  I asked for cups for water for our kids! The worker proceeded to tell me that it would cost me money for the cup.  When we got our food they didn't put the extra seasoning that I had asked for. And they said that would cost more money.  My husband had to go up and argue with them that I told them I wanted extra seasoning. They finally gave us some.  Are you kidding me.........   At this point if I would have known this would all happen before ordering I would not have had my family eat here.  And if we were close to home I would just get it as take-out and not even sit here.   My family will never come back here agin!",

There was NO change to the order....the issue was that both orders were made with 'bone-in' and he wanted boneless! My portion of the order, as stated was correct---your staff, wasn't listening to that FACT!  Free food!!? Chicken?? Really?? NOONE asked for ANYTHING free or complimentary! All I ask for was MY portion of the order that WAS prepared correctly! How do you tell a customer that you aren't going to do that as I was told!  All I did was suggest you provide some ameliorative measures in response to how your staff handled the matter! I didn't ask for or get anymore than what I PAID and asked for!  The receipt PROVES EXACTLY that!!  To resort to name calling---swindler and cheat....sorry, those are two things I am NOT, NEVER have been and NEVER will be!   It would be impossible for 3 different staff persons to verify anything as there was ONLY one person at the counter!! And she DID verify that she made a mistake!! Again, thank you Edith for telling the truth!   And, if what you were saying was indeed actual and factual you would have responded and resolved the situation prior to me leaving. The above response again shows just how UNPROFESSIONAL the management AND your establishment is!!",

    "text": "EPIC FAIL!  Wow, what a complete disappointment! HORRIBLE service!  We (2 of us) went in a little after noon on a Sunday for lunch. It was my first time trying a Wing Stop and I was super disappointed. The store hours say they open at 11am, but when we walked in after noon they were still setting things up and took several minutes to come to the counter to greet us. They were nice enough, but it took over 20 minutes to get our food.  Over 20 minutes for hot wings is ridiculous. Then to add insult to injury one of the two orders of fries was so over salted it was inedible. They replaced the fries without any hassle, but all the fries were not cooked the same. They were cut all oddball with some skinny and some thick, so some were overcooked and some undercooked.  The wings were decent, but nothing impressive. I have had better at several other wing places. There are too many places that make good wings and have good service to ever go here again.  I have a hunch the reason for the bad service was no management. I didn't see any manager in the store. Everyone looked college age and while it is certainly possible a college age person could be a manager, nobody in that store acted like one.   Steer clear if you want good food with good service.",

I just assumed they had a lot of Togo orders because people kept walking in to pick them up. The mango habanero was really good and the parmesan .We actually tried all the flavors .. the mild was to salty for us and we asked for no salt on fries but they put it on their any way.

There was grease spots or whatever the nasty on the picture frames, indicating that someone went tazmanian devil into the wings.  I literally saw the fries get re cooked.  Seriously, i thought these were supposed to be cooked to order.  The wings were also terrible.  The amount of Na+ in these wings was enough to cure meat in Alaska over the winter.  The staff needs to make sure they have clean gloves, not touch their phones with the gloves, and clean the bowls before just tossing teh next wing order into the bowls for flavor.  I can't imagine how old the wing juice was in some of those bowls.  Needless to say, I tried 1 wing and was done.  I couldn't even put words to what I saw when an employee licked their fingers with wing sauce on it.  I'm not a picky person, trust me, but this was totally unacceptable.

When I had the chance to eat my bag of food, the food was all soggy and not well prepared( rushed).   I am disappointed with this restaurant I feel like they could do a lot better for the price.

You can call in you order for pick up, order at the front for take out or dine in. I'm usually picking up 20 wings (real wings or boneless) and a order of fries before I go I work.   Fries?? Did somebody say Fries? Yes, yes I did. If you like fresh cut fries. This is the place. If you like that burger joint that givess you wayyyyyy to many. These are in the same lane. GOOD!!! They have the malt vinegar to go along with it. Ummmmm   It's in a strip mall (ohhh nooooo) tucked away in the corner. They're open til 12:00AM. I'm not sure about this location but the one in Pineville used to sell beer as well.   Today is Monday which means....... See my 1st sentence.  Go enjoy!  TTFN",

We got 20 traditional wings, 3 ranch and an order of \"veggie sticks\" for $21.50. There were quite a few people in the place when we got there, approximately 9 others not including ourselves. Their orders came and went but ours took a good 20 minutes to prepare. I'd say for the wait, it wasn't really worth it. I wasn't impressed, unfortunately! The wings were sub-par and the \"veggie sticks\" were just sliced-up old celery stalks. The best part of it all was their ranch sauce... It was herby, which I like. All in all, I'd have opted for a different spot for lunch had I known-they're basically a \"fast food\" version of Buffalo Wild Wings. Yet, B Dubs knows how to make wings for this girl!",

    "text": "First time giving Wingstop a try as one of our other favorite wing chains recently closed.   1. Got off to a rough start first with the cashier. He had a bit of an attitude problem. He asked for a name for the order and we made the mistake of starting to order, to which he just gave us a blank look and repeated the request for a name. When we gave him a name, he didn't understand it (\"Lee\" is uber-difficult apparently). As the owner or manager, I would expect my employees to be a bit more friendly to customers.   2. They've got a funky tea dispenser where you select the kind of tea you'd like. My first choice was out (cartridge needed replacing). Given our initial experience with the staff, it wasn't worth bothering them. As the owner or manager, I'd want my staff to do routine checks to ensure the area is clean and all options are available.  3. We wait for our food. Our name is called and our food comes packaged to go even though we had specified dine in. Should have been the first clue. Right as we were about to open the bag, someone comes into the back of the dining room muttering \"Lee\" - apparently to had given us the wrong order. Fortunately they caught it before we did, otherwise it would have been a bigger problem.  4. Lone bright spot was the staff member that called our order and when we picked it up, he read it back to us and confirmed it was correct.  5. Wings were ok. Lemon pepper could have been more balanced (they had a stronger lemon zest taste and low on pepper).   We'll explore and try other wing places before we return here (never). I find that most establishments in this are have staff attitude issues (might be the nearby college).",

    "text": "Pretty good experience with a chain I was skeptical about, mainly because I had never heard of them before. Wingstop has moved into this little nook of the Mallard Pointe shopping center where so many places have moved in and failed. I had noted the last time I was at the Food Lion that they seemed pretty busy so I figured I had to give them a go.  I ordered through their online app and it said the wings would be ready in 25 minutes. I pulled up as soon as the wings were supposed to be ready and they were bagging my order up. I've got to say that I kinda of agree with most of the other yelpers here that it seems like the staff is lacking in the customer service area. In my brief time in the restaurant, I got a vibe that no one really seemed happy to be there, but fortunately I was taking my order to-go.  I got home with my order of three different bone-in wing flavors and an order of Seasoned Fries. They separated all of the flavors in their own box with the fries on top. I actually liked that they left the fries open in the bag as it kept them from getting \"steamed\" and soggy in the bag.  First off, the fries were notably good! I suspected that they were fresh cut and looking back on their online menu found that they were. I bet they are even better fresh out of the kitchen as they cooled down a bit on the drive home, but still some of the better fries I've had in a while.  The wings were very good as well. I had ordered mild, Korean, and Hawaiian. The Hawaiian was a bit sweet and no kick at all (as advertised). Mild was your essential Buffalo Chicken wing with a tad of heat. It was the least \"wet\" as far as the sauce and was probably my favorite. The Korean came with some heat as well but not nearly as much as I was expecting with the \"three pepper symbol\" rating on their website. Still a nice flavor profile with ample sauce in the container to coat if you would like. The cook on all of the wings was great with a crispy skin and moist chicken.   I've given up on ordering wings on my trips to Buffalo Wild Wings, yet this place delivered nicely. The only real issue here is that just by glimpse of the dine-in service, I'll probably only order takeout here.",

She impatiently answered these, Do u have any specials tonight?  And how much are wings w/o a combo?    I took truly 1 more minute to decide what I was going to do and she rolled her eyes and said, \"So are you going to order?? 10 wings or what??\"  I answered no, I'm done!  Walked out...

The cashier told me the wait would be 17 minutes (which I was surprised at and wished I'd called ahead) so I walked around the strip mall area a little bit.  After about 10ish minutes, I walked back and my food was ready. I grabbed my cup and made my way to the drink station which was absolutely gross and a mess. I chose sweet tea but they have their tea in a Gold peak dispenser where you press which flavor of tea you want. What came out can best be described as light brown water. NOT GOOD. I threw it all down the sink when I got home.  As for the food, the wings were delicious. Nice, bold flavors and the chicken was nice and crispy. The fries were the winner for me though. Love, love, loved the seasoning and found myself understanding why so many people were asking for seasoning packets at Wingstop.  You will definitely enjoy your food from Wingstop just be sure to call ahead or order online!",

The manager apologized and its sad I will never eat there again because the food was really good :(",

    "text": "This was my first visit to a Wing Stop restaurant. The wait to order was not long at all and my food came out in a reasonable time considering the fact that the restaurant was extremely busy. My food was made just as I had ordered. I like the fact that it was piping hot when I sat down to eat it. The dining room was clean for the most part. The only downsides that I have to mention is the fact that the they don't put napkins in the tables and everyone is forced to get their napkins from this one large roll of paper towels that is on the condiment station.  From a food and health safety standpoint, I take extreme issue to that. Everyone's hands have been all over the paper towel roll before me. Also, the men's bathroom was disgusting. The toilet had not been flushed and the flor was littered with toilet paper and paper towel debris. The bathroom sink had hair all over it and there was not any paper towels in the automated dispenser (the red light was blinking which should have clearly indicated to an employee that the dispenser was out of paper towels, if they were checking the bathrooms regularly). I dined in and was in the restaurant about 2 hours, and not one time did I see an employee go to check those bathrooms out.   The food quality is what has assured that this is a 3 star review, because they certainly don't make the grade on cleanliness.",

They told me since I pre paid that they would need the manager to refund me. I said that was okay and called the manager the next day. He/she wasn't there. So I called the next day and a manager was finally there but said they would have to pass it along to their owner... Owner never reached out after multiple attempts at trying to reach him. Still to this day I have not been refunded over a big order of wings I never got. Poorly run place.",

I wanted badly to call my order in on my way over so I wouldn't have to wait at the counter, but after reading other reviews against this practice, I decide to just cool my heels and wait in the restaurant.   It was around 8pm, a few families were in there eating, one patron walked in ahead of me. Orders were placed quickly, and within 20 minutes I had my wings. I was pleased (lucky?) I didn't have any issue with food, wait or service. My daughter and I both enjoyed our wings at home.   I will be back to try different flavors, hopefully everything goes as smoothly as the first time.",

    "text": "Wing stop would definitely be a better review if the would get the service and flow of this location right . There were so many customers waiting,  coming back because something was missing , or just lost lol.   If you don't care about any of the above statements,  and just want some good wings then this is your spot.  We ordered a family pack of 30 wings, mixing it up with garlic parmesan , honey bbq, and traditional hot wings , we chose all drums but they couldn't accommodate our request , giving us 20 drums and 10 flats.  Why have the option if you can't do it ? Yet they still charged us for doing all drums? The order was accompanied by large fries , which were yummy as well. All inall , tasty, yes , but would I come back? Probably not . It's too far from where I live, and it's too unorganized.  Too many wing spots in Charlotte to make this a favorite .",
