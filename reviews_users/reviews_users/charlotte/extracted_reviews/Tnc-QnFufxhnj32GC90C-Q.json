There is also a small store that has an awesome selection of craft beer & wine. I haven't tried the coffee but it definitely smells wonderful!

Run by the same guys as Common Market, Rhino Market and Deli is nearly a carbon copy of the CM vibe. Good selection of wine, beer, and non alcoholic beverages (hello Blenheim's Hot Ginger Ale!). They have daily sandwich specials and on Wednesday it is a French Dip - a sandwich that I have an obsession with. Lucky for me, I decided to try this place on a Wednesday I got it to go and when i had my first bite at my desk at the office, I pretty much decided I will be going to the Rhino every Wednesday to get this delicious treat. Shaved beef, Havarti cheese, Rosemary bun, and some delicious au jus. French Dip perfection.   I love the quirky atmosphere, odd trinkets, snacks, wine, and beer that is offered. Plus hard to find mixers,  bitters, sauces, seasonings, and of the beaten path non-alcoholic beverages.  This will definitively be my new place when Common Market closes next month. Basically the same thing with a different name. Just wish there were more soup selections like at CM. Denver Green Chili? It's better at CM than it is in Denverv IMHO. Hopefully they pass that recipe along to the Rhino. It's amazing!",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped by Rhino Market to fuel up before going on a long walk to take advantage of 70 degree weather in February (Yay for living in NC). First off, this place is where I suspect the hipsters hang out before they make their daily migration to Central. However they have a top notch deli, impressive beer and wine selection, and a ton of local products.  We mainly stopped in to hit the deli for lunch, and were not disappointed. I got the chicken torta sandwich on sourdough and my wife got a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of broccoli cheddar soup. My sandwich was awesome. Tons of pulled chicken and avocado, which offset the spiciness of the jalapeno peppers. I was also impressed with the broccoli cheddar soup. Way more broccoli than I had ever seen in a soup, but it was simple and packed a ton of flavor.  As for the rest of the store, they do have places to sit, but I would treat it more as a grab and go place for lunch. The inside is pretty bare bones, but it matches the atmosphere. If you have more time, they do have a bunch of local drafts on tap worth checking out. I also appreciated the volume of local products from coffee to beer and most everything in-between. My only gripe is that Rhino Market is on the other side of town from where I work, making it difficult for me to go for lunch!",

    "text": "I absolutely love Rhino Market & Deli. Rhino Market is a great pit stop for eclectic beers or a bottle of wine on the run but also provides seating both inside (limited) and outside (dog's welcome) for you to have a seat and enjoy your beverage. In addition to drinks, there are snacks including chips, jerky, local bread from Duke's (I highly recommend the sourdough), and the best ice cream sandwiches you will ever taste (Nye's Cream Sandwiches, get the strawberry shortcake). Don't forget the Deli which serves sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have a great selection of both meaty and vegetarian sandwiches. My go to order is the Chaud Legumes, it will make a vegetable lover out of the biggest meat lover, with its many grilled veggies, mozzarella, and garlic aioli to top it off, you will not be disappointed.   There is always something going on, whether it is Monday night trivia or live music Saturdays. Do not miss out on this local gem!",

You can buy wine, beer and here's a bar for beer on tap or glasses of wine. The deli sandwiches all sound amazing and they sell lots of snacks too! They have different events throughout the week. For example, poetry readings on Thursdays. There's not much sitting space though, only 4-5 tables. Great spot to grab lots of craft beers!",

I do always grab a sandwich. They have a list of vegetarian and a list for meat sandwiches. On the latest visit, I got the club. It's nice. Not a double decker of anything so it's just enough food. Could have used another strip of bacon though. One half didn't seem to have any.  They have a fridge there with sides like slaw and broccoli salad. They have soup. They also offer quite an array of special sodas in cans and bottles as well as lotsa beer and even wine. Some cold, some not.  While waiting for my to-go order, I browsed. I dig that they offer bitters, syrups and vermouth. I was pleasantly surprised to see a bottle of real orgeat (French) so snatched that up for my at home bar.  Also, great patio in the side. Just watch out for the parking lot as some patrons seem to make their own spots making it a bit hard to navigate.",

I order the spinach salad with goat cheese and bacon.  Delicious and the amount of cheese was just perfect. Lol.  They are not selfish with the bacon either. :)   My husband had a salami sandwich?

The eggs were cooked perfectly, with just a smudge of runny yolk to flavor the bread and mix with the cheese. The spinach was flavorful and added a hearty taste. My SO was very happy with his sandwich and we spent the rest of our morning wondering why we can't find these kinds of breakfast sandwiches where we are.   The selection of beers, wine was impressive and the staff very nice! Glad we made an effort to get away from the airport and get a real taste of local Charlotte!",

    "text": "I just moved to Charlotte from Atlanta, and decided to go to Rhino Market for lunch while a friend was in town. I could tell we had picked a great spot the minute we walked in. The Market side of Rhino has all sorts of local beverages on top of your typical sodas and beers. There was a good selection of local craft sodas, most of which I had no idea about. I also really enjoyed their selection of craft beer. We ended up buying a couple of six packs after lunch. The market also carries a variety of wines, sake, and snacks. It's definitely one of the nicest local markets I've visited.   Once we spent an obscene amount of time looking through all the offerings in the market, we decided to finally order from the deli. My friend ordered the Italian sandwich. It looked great, and she loved it. I ordered the Reuben sandwich. I love a good Reuben, so I'm typically very picky about them. The sandwich was cooked perfectly. The bread was not too thick or thin. They were very generous with the pastrami- as one should be when making a Reuben. The only complaint I had was the Creole mustard did overwhelm the 1000 island, but that's not much of a complaint because the mustard was excellent. I also picked up a small bag of Deep River Rosemary Olive Oil chips (which I'd never seen before) and they are some of the best bagged chips I've had.   My friend also ordered a beer while we were here. The tap area has a cool set up with a good selection of beers. Definitely something I look forward to trying when I go back.   As far as the service, everyone we spoke with was friendly and helpful. The time to get our food was definitely reasonable, and considering I purchased a sandwich, bag of chips, and a root beer the price wasn't bad. The quality of food was well worth the price.   Overall, I was really impressed. This is definitely a place I'll revisit. Especially since I saw they have team trivia on Mondays! There was also information about live music events they host. Definitely a great spot that should be checked out!",

I still feel like Fud at Salud is better (same concept) but when I want to switch it up, I'll go here. Fud has cheaper beer and a really interesting sandwich line up.   Both places do spicy really well which is hard to find in Charlotte. I usually order \"extra spicy\" everywhere but these guys aren't shy about their sauces.",

A little smaller than common market (RIP, South End location...), Rhino serves all the same things you loved about common, but in a smaller footprint and more neighborhood feel. Delicious deli sandwiches and killer breakfast options? Check. A tap full of beers you've never heard of? They got it. Beer and wine sold by the bottle both cold and room temp? Duh. Live jazz and trivia during the week when the sun goes down? Why not! The Glass Animals pandora station playing? My dear sir, it's heresy to believe any other acoustic treat would be proclaimed from their speakers!  But ten fiddy Mondays, ya'll. $10.50 for dinner and a pint. You just can't beat that. My suggestion? Chicken Torta. But you won't be disappointed with anything you get. This place is really a gem for Wesley Heights, and I keep on coming back.",

There are sweet snack and savory snacks as well such as beef jerky, vegetarian jerky, and other options.  The staff was helpful and friendly, since it was my first visit here.  They showed me where to order and pay.  I look forward to stopping in on an evening and trying thr bar area or perhaps the outside.",

I walked in and was shocked at the beers they are hiding over here. I also love you can drink anything you buy on site, so there are a TON of options. They have cheap wine by the glass as well and mimosas!   The deli is also excellent. A lot of good vegetarian options. My favorite sandwiches so far are the Chaud legumes and the pimento cheese sandwich, add bacon. I have also enjoyed the Reuben. The le monde for breakfast on sourdough is excellent! (Add avocado).   This is just a great hangout spot. The long hours are perfect as well. I would swing by on my way to work for coffee and breakfast, and I would swing by on my way home for beer. Keep it up Rhino. There's a reason you see me every week.",

The cashier tipped me off on BYOB for tasting on the 1st Wendesday of every month which is a cool way to meet people and discover new brews. I will for sure come in for one of these and update my review accordingly.   We came here yesterday for lunch. We were surprized to find so many vegetarian options, nice! I ordered the chaud legumes while the bf ordered the chicken torta. It was fun to browse through all the wine, beer and goodies while waiting for our food to come out. I didn't expect the sandwich to be so big and so tasty! The bread was delicious and fresh, it had the perfect crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. The portobella mushrooms, peppers and caramelized onions do not make you miss meat, what a wonderful combination. Yeah, it is a little more expensive than the average Subway sandwhich but the freshness in component of Rhino Deli's sandwhiches really comes through.   We will definitely be back! Cheers!",

Along with that the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I love their beer selection and love, love, love their portabello sandwich. Probably one of my favorites in Charlotte.  For merchandise, they have a lot of craft beer and local food vendors represented.  It's a good place to hang out and there's plenty of parking right now...until a developer buys the parking lot.",

    "text": "Fiiii-nally! This place was long anticipated in FreeMoreWest and thankfully it delivered. I was worried the food wouldn't be any better than boring Common Market, but thankfully it is definitely better and more interesting. I was lucky enough to get a sneak peek and tasting of the menu before it opened and Rob was great about taking feedback and is still making adjustments.   The space is light, airy and lofty. At first it's jarring if you're used to Common Market, but it's actually so nice because it's not claustrophobic and cramped like CM. It's also sunny, which can be a bad thing but it's just a bit happier. I have been in there a few times where there was only outdoor seating available which isn't great if it's 45 degrees but it will be rocking this summer.   Onto the menu! The Chaud Legumes sandwich has nice warm juicy portabella mushrooms. It's super tasty on their GF (gluten free) bread option (butter lettuce) but be warned- it's so juicy it's messy. Their normal bread for that is ciabatta (ask for that grilled too). As someone else mentioned the chicken torta is substantial and delicious. It's a big hunka sandwich and great if you're a hungry hungry rhino.   The salads are also great. Their basic chicken salad is definitely light on the mayo (rejoice!) and chunky chicken, not that mushy shit people are peddling these days. It has grapes (wish their were more) and celery for crunch. Simple, but tasty and full of protein. Their Rhyno salad is delish as is their spinach bacon (add avo). Their citrus vin far outweighs their red wine vin. It's nice to see a nicoise salad in Charlotte (though I do with they'd go for it and add tuna.   Chilly? Rhino also has soups, including a daily vegan Garden Veggie Soup that is healthy, hearty and heavenly. Other daily specials change all the time. The only thing I wish is they had a crusty bread / roll to buy along with it.   I haven't tried their breakfast sandwiches / burritos but I have had their coffee (all local brews) and are delicious. Enderly coffee on tap? Yeahhhhhh.  They also have local brews and national  microbrews and a giant selection of really good wines and even bubbly ( Roederer Estate!). Rob's done a great job of selecting goodies. Their small fridge by the deli features salami, cheese, small sides of pasta & chicken salad to go, but also desserts including a locally made cheesecake company called QC cheesecake. Pumpkin bourbon cheesecake? Don't mind if I do. They also have other good looking things I shouldn't try in there as well.    It will be interesting to see how much they add over time.",

My friend ordered a sandwich and specifically asked for no mayonnaise which then came with a large amount of mayonnaise! We were two of just a handful of guests at the time - not sure how that happened. Rhino is somewhat like the Common Market but without the fun \"funky-ness\" of the CM (you can decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.) They offer wine by the glass, some beer on tap. They have a large selection of beer and wine on shelf and in coolers. Live music is featured on occasion which is a big plus for me. I'll go back.",

    "text": "Stopped in the new Rhino Deli on the Westside tonight (Thurs) to grab a quick bite before heading home from a late one at work. Ordered a Chicken Torta ($7.95) that is so noteworthy that I had to come write a review while I'm still eating it.   Juicy chicken. Toasted ciabatta. Melted cheese. Fresh sliced avocado. Jalapenos for a delightful kick. Lettuce, tomato and a lil mayo. Carefully assembled, wrapped in butcher paper by a cute cook in the back, and served warm! I fully intended to take a picture but it smelled so delicious....  It's a hearty sandwich (I'm filling up but can't stop eatingggggg) so that makes me okay with the price tag. I also grabbed a beer (22 oz cider, $5.99) from the fridge. They have a decent beer selection that will hopefully continue to grow but it's a bit overpriced (minus 1 star). Good wine selection too.    Although I grabbed my food to go, there was a pretty good crowd hanging out inside tonight (it's a small spot, especially when cold weather nixes the patio space). The tables in the front and the small bar in the back were full of happy, chatty, people. Add in some music and you have a fun place that makes you feel more hipster than you probably are :)  My favorite part of this spot (aside from this chicken torta...have I mentioned how simple, yet amazing it is?) is the old school candy you can buy at the check out counter. Nostalgia for days.   Go check them out. Get the chicken torta. You won't regret it. Gotta go now as I savor these last few bites...",

    "text": "Ah the Rhino - what a great little local haunt!  Somewhere between a craft beer bottle shop, a deli, a mini mart, and a neighborhood hangout, this place is cozy and wonderful.  They've got free wifi and some seating if you want to sit down and get some work done while you sip on a beer, and the staff's always got an interesting story to share.  There's loads of beer by the bottle, and a handful of taps, and a good selection of wine and soft drinks, including lots from local sellers.  The food is really great, too.  I love their BLT with Avocado (called the ABLT, but really, we all know it should be called \"BLAT BLAT BLAT BLAT\" because that sandwich is gangsta as hell).  Stop in, you won't be disappointed!",

They source their bread from Local Loaf, which in my opinion, make the sandwiches. Grab the Chicken Torta for your first try. It's incredible!  Service is well paced and friendly. I can see this place easily sliding into a Charlotte staple. So glad someone is stepping up to the plate and filling the affordable, local lunch spots we desperately need. Thanks!",

We hosted a happy hour there and everyone seemed to be happy with the beer.   I was a little disappointed with the sandwiches we got. We got a french dip and made our own with bacon, prosciutto, and goat cheese. The one we made ourself was pretty good, but the french dip was so dry it was almost inedible. We got them without the bread so I'm not sure if that's what made it dry, but even using the au jus didn't help.   Overall, I really like this place and will probably be back. I'd like to give their food a second chance.",

I arrived early and got a nice bacon, egg, and cheese muffin and a cup of coffee.  A bit more than say a McDonald's meal, but it was made then and the coffee was craft brewed.  The seating area is limited since the bulk of the store is beer, wine, and snack aisles.  The mix of people is awesome: hipsters, suit and ties, dad and kids, business meetings around laptops, jogging pants, the stereotypical apple laptop writer in a beard and fedora, cops, you name it, this place has it all.  It's a nice blend of all people that shows that beer, coffee and food unite us all!  It's a nice spot to hang out, a live DJ comes out most nights, and the beer selection is very niche.  There are things there I have never seen, so if you are looking for a unique or hard to find brew, try them out!",

    "text": "I stopped in at Rhino Market & Deli to continue my adventure around Charlotte to find the best reuben, and I was surprised to find the reuben was served with pastrami even though they also had corned beef on the menu. With two of us on the adventure it made sense to get two different reubens and split them - one Rhino style with pastrami and creole mustard and one classic with corned beef and russian. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of either one.   Starting with the typical Rhino reuben, the proportions were just off. Although the pastrami was delicious, there was barely any on the sandwich. Most of the bites I had were primarily kraut and mustard - my two least favorite parts of a reuben (or modified reuben, most reubens don't have mustard). The couple bites that had OK proportions were good, but I was pretty unhappy with the overall reuben. Plus, the bread was horribly soggy which is yet another unpleasant experience with a reuben.  On to the modified (traditional) reuben. It was basically the same as above except loaded with corned beef - no idea why one sandwich had 3 times the meat as the other. The bread was again soggy, but at least with russian mixed in the flavors worked out OK. Unlike the pastrami, the corned beef was just your average typical deli meat and nothing special (maybe that's why they serve it with pastrami).  Although Rhino Market is a fun spot to hang out, I'd recommend avoiding the reuben based on my experience.",

Besides it's close vicinity, though, Rhino is just plain awesome for a quick bite, beer, and/or wine run.   We decided to grab sandwiches before heading up to the Panthers game last night. My husband had the hot Sicilian and I had the chicken salad sandwich - so much YUM. The sandwiches came out in about 5 minutes, ingredients were fresh, and were filled to the brim with meat and veggie goodness.   I also really appreciate the huge selection of  unique side items - everything from tomato and mozz salad, broccoli salad, and fresh fruit, to a whole aisle of chips, ranging from traditional brands to options for our healthier cravings, like kale chips. I went with a kettle chip salt and vinegar option, boasting 30% less fat than other chips... totally healthy, right? Right.   We took our sandwiches to go, but what really put the cherry on top of our experience was spotting a six pack of Great Lakes Christmas Ale, hubby's holiday fav. That obviously came home with us, too.   As always, thanks, Rhino - we'll be back soon!",

They have about 15 tables some inside, some outside.  Busy when we arrived and I grabbed a table while hubby went to order.  Friday's special was a Gyro sandwich and this is a go-to favorite for us both.  He ordered two Gyro specials and we were ready for a good lunch.   The food was ready fast.  By the time hubby paid at the register food was ready at the pick up window.  Hubby took one bite of the Gyro and said, \"umm, umm, you won't like it.\"  Unfortunately he was right.  The meat had a strange flavor, there were few veggies on the sandwich and the tzatiki was watery.  I did not eat the Gyro sandwich because I didn't care for it at all.  Decided to just order another sandwich and tried the 'veggie chaud'.  I must say this was very good.  They have a lot of vegetarian options.  Maybe meat isn't their thing.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, \"What is not to love about Rhino Market and Deli?\" We'll start with the location - Rhino sits just west of Uptown on the awesome neighborhood of Wesley Heights. If you live in the neighborhood, you've been to Rhino because it's a one stop shop for some of your shopping needs. You can grab a sandwich, coffee, beer, wine, pre-made meals, and an assortment of other locally crafted food and beverages. With Wesley Heights being more \"up and coming,\" there aren't a ton of places to grab something quick. Rhino definitely fills that niche.  One thing I love about Rhino is the neighborly atmosphere. It's definitely a friendly spot to hang out, read a book, grab a bite to eat, grab a drink, play some trivia, listen to live music, and overall just sit and \"be.\" The staff are always fantastic - friendly, conversational, and fun are words I would use to describe the staff.   Let's talk menu for a minute -- I am a fan of the entire menu, but my favorites are the french toast (YUM -- local bread, real maple syrup -- did I say YUM already?), the ham sandwich, and the grilled cheese with soup. Rhino has amazing, fresh made soups. My favorites are the chicken and rice, chicken noodle, corn chowder (with bacon!), tomato, and broccoli cheddar. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Beer and wine selection are outstanding! I love that Rhino serves a variety of local coffees brewed fresh. Rhino has ample parking and is a family-friendly environment. Sometimes, they have special events like Open Mic Night on Wednesday.  If you have not been to Rhino, add it to your Charlotte Bucket List NOW and go ASAP. You are really missing out on a gem. For all the other Rhino lovers out there, I'll see you around at Rhino.",

Fantastic and fresh coffee (often times they have an option from a local toaster), great selection of beer and wine (oh and they have a small bar too with beers on tap), and the BEST deli in Charlotte. I would come here daily for the breakfast burritos alone, but all of the salads and sandwiches are so tasty you should really try them all. Love the relaxed vibe where you'll see people working, studying, catching up with friends, or just hanging out. The staff is great, super friendly and nice. Lunch time is madness here, so try and go before 11:30 or after 1:00 if you don't want to wait 15-20 minutes for your food.",

They sell lots of snacks, as well as well-known and unique sodas.   They sell beer and wine too, and have a few drafts at the bar.   There's some tables inside but they also have a pretty patio out back to enjoy the weather. Huge parking lot makes parking easy.",

The bread for the sandwiches are delicious and the freshest of any sandwich shop I've been to in Charlotte. The choices for vegan/vegetarian are many, and I chose the Tofu You. It was BBQ tofu, lettuce, onion, pickle, tomato and vegan mayo. It was INSANE. I've not enjoyed a sandwich this much since being a vegan. Thank you Rhino!!   I will come back as often as my diet will allow. A+!",

I only went for lunch but I can't wait to call the girls and make it a little happy hour gossip sesh!    On to the good stuff.. I met up with some partners and had a lunch meeting.  My first mistake, I didn't come before or after the lunch rush.  Second mistake, I sat outside around noon in JULY. I'm a southern girl and I definitely knew better.  Despite the buckets of sweat I accrued during my meeting, my experience was great. The Chicken torta was highly recommended by a few people so of course I had to order it.  Out of this world! Caution: If spicy is not your thing, don't order this.  It was loaded with Jalapenos but I didn't mind!   This place reminds of the little corner markets I used to frequent when living in San Fran.  Very charming with fun yummy things to look at.    Rhino Market....PLEASE come to Ballantyne so I can make you a regular lunch spot!",

The deli makes fresh food made to order within 10 minutes or less. There is certainly no shortage of alcoholic beverage options!!  This location gives off a very strong community vibe where they play trivia at night, on occasion they have live music inside while dining, and they always offer a smile with the service.    Rhino Market is a place that I hope never loses it momentum or community vibe.  I'm excited to move closer to the market very soon so I can be considered a local rather than just a regular!",

I love pretty close so one day I was hungry & decided to take a walk and ended up here. They had my favs from Hubert's Lemonade to a variety of Izze's along with energy drinks, water, and juices in the cooler right when you walk in. Then as you continue to walk you see assorted beer coolers and lots of wine!  Once you get to the back there's a deli that has breakfast items, sandwiches,salads, soups, and vegetarian items. I ordered the pollo salad which was pretty good but I didn't like their balsamic vin.  They also have a cooler that you can grab pasta salads, olives, egg salad, and other side items. The Greek pasta salad was really good.",

Recently did brunch with friends here and the french toast was AMAZING.  Limited tables inside, but large patio outside and ample parking for all!  Yes, part of the lot is gravel, just don't speed through like a JA and leave a dust cloud for everyone to choke on.  Order at the counter, with super nice staff.... pay at the register with the ticket order you are given.    If you walk in for the first time here, it can be sensory overload, but that is just a testament of all their offerings here.  Quick snack, actual sandwiches, there is something for everyone here.  There are really cool gift finds here you can stumble upon.  I mean, who doesn't want a mexican wrestler bottle opener?",

It was so good I can't even remember if it was sweet potato or butternut squash because it doesn't matter--it was THAT good!  They also have a unique, fun little marketplace with everything from beer and wine to coffee beans and fun snacks. They carry some snacks I'm not able to find anywhere else in the city. Definitely a wider range than Common Market. If I lived closer, I would constantly be running in there to get a freshly delivered baked good or funky bag of chips.   They have some seating indoors but where they really shine is their patio. One of my favorite Charlotte memories is sitting out on the patio one afternoon, enjoying my soup and the sunshine while a local duo played guitar and upright bass. They have a bunch of games out there, so I recommend grabbing a crew, ordering some sandwiches, opening a bottle of wine, and settling in for an afternoon on the patio.",

Rhino Market and Deli offers a lot more than initially expected. You'll find a kitchen inside serving up salads and sandwiches (some of the best I've tasted in a while!) Plus a small bar with beer on draft or feel free to grab something from the cooler to drink. A large patio was home to the \"work from home crowd\" crowd --did I mention they also serve up all your coffee favorites?!-- groups of friends, dates and the casual new comer.   The Sicilian sandwich was delicious as was the Big Wheel, reasonable prices and lots of meats on both. I liked the vibe, I liked the food, I loved the large patio and overall got the sense that Rhino is a spot where you can make friends with the staff and return many times.  Update: upon second visit to Rhino Market & Deli, we tried the Stacked High and added pickles (you must add pickles!) This is officially my new favorite. We went with the cold Sicilian again which didn't compare with the Stacked High this time. Really my only qualm, and this is after eating many an Italian sandwich, is that prosciutto isn't sliced thin enough. Not sure the average sandwich eater would notice. But otherwise, really nothing to terrible to complain about.",

I ordered the piled high sandwich with corned beef.  The rye bread was an average (nothing special) and definitely not what I expected for $8. To my disappointment, most of the corned beef was very chewy and I could not eat it.  I hate to give locally owned restaurants bad reviews. However, I hope this feedback will help them improve. If you want to charge $8 for a sandwich with nothing on it but meat with no sides, you had better serve the best ingredients!",

This is a very popular Deli in Charlotte, and definitely has a hipster flavour to it, but one thing that I don't like about it is that the service was pretty nasty on both occasions I've been here. Some employees more than others.  Also the deli closes way way earlier than the store itself, so I've only been able to get food here one of the two times that we came here. It's a lot of people's fave sandwich shop in town so I'm sure I'll be back again but I don't love it.  My previous review said:  Pretty hipster dally ripping off the name Torta to make something that is really nothing like a Torta. Very popular with the locals who love their sandwich shops but ironically don't have that many good sandwich shops. Unless you count the Euro Deli which is Bosnian food which is amazing - but most people not only don't count that but don't even know it exists and that is a problem because it's some of the best food. Anyway at Rhino's don't forget you can't get sandwiches after 9. I wish that fact was more public because I drove here for nothing the second time I came. There probably won't be a 3rd.",

I also love the various milk options (including my personal fav - oat milk!). A small is two bucks, which is super reasonable. I do wish they had a frequent buyer program to earn a free coffee after a certain number of purchases, but that would just be icing on the cake.

    "text": "I really enjoy Rhino for running in and grabbing a quick coffee to-go or to grab a sandwich and use the WiFi for a working lunch away from the office.   The options for food and drinks are varied and very good. While their coffee options are usually about 5 drip coffees- no fancy hot chocolates, lattes, or espresso...just the drip. The thing that I love about getting coffee here is their options for that drip coffee. First any time I'm there they have Enderly Coffee on drip and Enderly is my favorite local coffee and then it's the milk/creamer options. They have half&half, oat, skim. They also have several sweetner options.",

I love that they offer a multitude of dietary friendly options -- vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, even if you're paleo, you can find something in here.  We've been here quite a bit and I can't believe this is my first review.  I definitely want to shout out Shelby in the kitchen. When we went in this past weekend, I ordered a GF sandwich and I wanted it hot and she called our ticket and proceeded to ask if it was okay if the bread was toasted with toppings on the side because the GF bread tends to get \"soggy\" on the griddle with the oil. UM SERIOUSLY! Yes, of course! She went above and beyond which was so welcomed to me. I loved being able to physically build my own open-faced sandwich and have the great crunchy, not soggy, GF bread. Thank you!!",

    "text": "Rhino Market is quickly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots. Their sandwiches are made-to-order and with higher quality ingredients. In particular, their bread options for sandwiches are all good. My only wish is that they would provide pickles with their sandwiches.  Rhino is located right across the street from Pinky's and shares a large parking lot with some other establishment (whose name I forget). I recommend calling ahead and placing your order because, during lunch hours, you may find yourself waiting longer than normal.  They have daily specials which are posted on their website and I'm sure on their various social media channels. You can choose to order one of their menu items that consist of sandwiches and salads or make your own. They are home to the chicken torta so I usually tell newbies to try that first but they have plenty that caters to meat eaters and vegetarians.  Inside Rhino, they have large refrigerated cases that house everything from bottled water/juices to lenny boy kombucha to cans of beer. In the aisles, you'll find bottles of wine and all sorts of snacks and treats. Bonus, there's also a mini bar where they serve glasses of wine.  There's seating inside and outside that allow for excellent people-watching. I'd recommend this as a great meeting/coworking spot. Whatever you do, definitely make sure you stop in for a sandwich, whether it be for breakfast or lunch!",

Rhino is one of the local spots ( one of two Rhinos that I know of in Charlotte), where you can get a freshly made breakfast or lunch sandwich, bottle alcoholic or non alcoholic beverages, as well as beer on tap, as well as all the snacks you may need . Coffee, local coffee as well.   What I love most about places like this is , there is so much you can do to your deli sandwiches ( vegetarian, loads of meat, gluten free).  I also love the fact that here you can find that one wine that was really good that one night when you went to that place a couple of weeks ago, or that snack bar you can't find at the grocery store , but was so good the other day.   This location has indoor and outdoor seating if you want to take your time, enjoy your purchase there and catch a vibe . Check them out.",

I sat outside. There's seating inside and outside which is nice. The French Toast was great and I really liked the little fruit medley they served with it. It came with peaches and blueberries and they were seasoned very well. As always my foodie partner (my 6 year old) loved the food so I would say it's kid approved.

I actually arrived at about 11:11, or at least that was the time when I reached the back counter to order food. I attempted to order a breakfast sandwich and I was told that breakfast was over. So, I decided to sit and wait on my three lunch companions to arrive and order with them.  I arrived early and to do work prior to their arrival to make sure to snag a table for four people since there are only three tables inside that seat four people.    I settled in and then had some women who works there asked me if I could move so that people who were there for lunch could get a seat.  She said that she was asking everyone on a computer to move to a single seat.  I then explained that I  had three people meeting me.  She then asked is they were meeting me for lunch 3 times and I answered \"yes\".  Let me be clear that it was like was asking a child and not the customer.  She asked to the point that it was accusatory and uncomfortable. Then, as I thought I made myself clear she said \"ma'am\" again as if I needed to move and I sad I have three people meeting me here for lunch. And she said again \"for lunch?\".  It's then that I decided to text everyone and go to a restaurant where I don't have to stake out table and then be harassed to move.  I have now spent hundreds of dollars on lunch, dinner, coffee, wine, and beer.  I shared with people how great the location is. I have told them to meet me there for lunch, dinner, coffee, wine, and beer.  It's a disappointment and disgrace to be treated with such disrespect.  It's unfortunate that money doesn't buy one respect.",

Bread was good, carmalized onions were decent, way to heavy on the mustard.  The opportunities:  No real selection yet of munchies/snacks.  Small case with some cheeses and olives. Insanely high prices on random things. 13 bucks for the large Delirium is totally acceptable but 6 dollars for the regular size Owl beer is just crazy.   Overall a welcome addition to my hood. We'll stop in for that emergency bottle of wine every so often and hope there are other folks in Wesley Heights that can afford to keep this place open for us.",

The ordering window was fast. My only small grievance is that can we at least get a side of chips or even just pickle with our sandwich, lol?   I've had the chicken torta before and it's a generous size sandwich for the price. Nice soft ciabatta bread with juicy chicken breast, jalapenos, avocado, tomato, and mayo. Can't really go wrong.   The market itself has a wide variety of organic and non organic beers, wines, coffees, cookies, & other snacks. Their bathroom is also unisex which is a test to the current HB2 law debacle going on in NC right now. #wearenotthis  Sat out on the patio with an organic strawberry beer and even participated in their trivia night for a bit. They had other board games & even a doggie water bowl for our babes (she didn't drink out of it). Overall a chill & cool place to grab a quick bite!",

They have made perfect use of the space with a market area, a deli area along with tables to sit down and eat and a beer counter with about 8 beers on tap. The staff is friendly and helpful. Oh and the sandwiches are great, at least the 2 that the wife and I devoured last Friday. She choose the veggie one called chaud legume, and I was recommended the Reuben over the chicken torta, but I will return soon to get a chicken torta. She grabs a lenny boy kombucha and I get a beer.  Sometimes there is nothing like a greasy deli sandwich to hit the spot. My Reuben had the perfect mix of ingredients, the pastrami, the creole mustard, the kraut, they were all damn tasty. You know that you have a great menu with all the different meat and vegetarian options. We will definitely be frequent flyers!",

I found both Voodoo spiced potato and the best Dill potato chips in existance (not too vinegar to ruin the roof of my mouth). SO much beer and wine selection.

Added two bags of a chips and a corona which all came up to $26.00 sheesh! The sandwiches weren't good to us. Not very flavorful and the type of bread I had was just to much. The service was outstanding I will give them that. The place was packed and the options of chips were pretty cool. My chips were better than my sandwich. I'll stick to common or laurel market.

My wife had the chicken salad on a bed of butter bib lettuce...excellent. We enjoyed the salads so much we came back the next day (daughter doesn't cook much) and had the Reuben and the gyro sandwiches. The Reuben was meaty and delicious. The gyro was good but I've had a few that were better but that's being pretty picky right now. Living in the area would be a treat because the staff is friendly and chill and I would wander over to sit outside and sample one of the 8 or so craft beers on tap or grab a bottle of wine and enjoy a good read. I'm a fan.",

The Ten Gift beer/sandwich special is great, and the chicken torta is tasty as can be. A great spot for a stop on the Greenway while headed towards town from FreeMoreWest, and a nice spot to catch a band or DJ. If you're nearby, stop in, grab a beer, and tell Rob hello!",

I'm from Philadelphia and a True sandwich snob  This is, by far the BEST spot I've found to drool over a well constructed, almost too big to take a bite, good to the last morsel concoction. There's a wise selection of staples on the hot and cold side. The topping selection is on point and it always fresh. Did I mention they also have AWESOME breakfast options?!  I don't live in the area, but work up down so is is always a drive. With the news they're opening a new spot right on Church Street (across from Mellow Mushroom) I'll now be right across the street!! Whether you visit this location or wait until the new one opens, you should not be disappointed!!",

The homemade vegetable, chicken noodle, and clam chowder soups are made to perfection and perfectly seasoned. I love my Mom dearly, but these soups are better than what my sweet Mom can make.

They have a handful of craft beers on tap, and a ton of six packs to take home. The vibe is hip, and fun - you can hang out and sip coffee or beer, or take things to go. Whatever works best for you. The coffee is awesome-sauce - It has perfect descriptions and smells so stinking good. And there are two sizes of coffee, basically medium and large. For some reason, I just really like this. They get me. And honestly, there is not a day when just a small coffee is going to do it, come on people - be honest. They have wifi and I've sat in here to do a little bit of work before hitting Uptown for work - I love the friendly, chill atmosphere.   The deli is in the back; decide what you want, order then pay and hang out until they call your number. I highly suggest the english muffin with egg whites - but if you get there after 11am, then its lunch time. So get the spinach salad with goat cheese. I know what you're thinking, \"Kel, that's healthy and it has nuts in it, yick.\" But don't fret, Grasshopper. Even the nuts taste good in this salad combo, and the bacon will help to balance it. Order it. DELICIOUS.   It was initially really hard for me to find the parking lot - I don't know why I kept missing the turn in driveway, but turn right after the burger place, it's tucked behind there with the gravel lot. There are a few random spaces up front, but I usually park in the gravel just to stay out of everyone's way.   I've only stopped here on my way to work, so this is a \"morning scene\" review. I'll update you when I hang out here one evening.",

When you walk in, your first thought will be hmmmm this looks like Common Market. No, you're not crazy. A former CM'er is behind this place. It feels bigger than both CMs. I don't know if it actually is, or if it's just because of the more open layout. It doesn't feel as cramped.  You'll find a great selection of wine and beer here. Specialty product type stuff. They've also got some great brews on tap and good coffee. (Watch out Dunkin Donuts across the street in the weird, former tattoo place)  Hungry? Hit the deli in the back. You order there and pay at the register. They'll yell when it's ready. There are a lot of options... including a good amount of vegetarian selections. I like the house vegetable soup. Last visit I got a bowl of that and the Sicilian. I ended up taking home half the sandwich (I was so full) and having it the day for lunch. They also have a breakfast menu.  There's a nice little patio outside. The parking is pretty ample, but the lot is kind of awkward. There a few tables inside to eat or sit down to do some work.   My only real complaint is that this place didn't open a few years ago when I worked at WBTV. Although, my wallet is probably happy about that.",

The vibe is very casual, and the staff are quick to give recommendations if you're having a hard time deciding on what to eat or drink. I've had a few experiences that were... awkward... but nothing too bad and, hey, we all have our off days.  The market itself is located in a shared building, at the intersection of Morehead and Freedom. The parking lot can be crazy at times but there's plenty of spaces and, in the event that there are no vacant spots, there's always the option to street park. Inside, it feels pretty spacious but the seating is a bit limited. They do have a patio which recently got it's very own partial awning; this is nice, since it sits directly in the sun most of the day.  All in all, Rhino Market is a very endearing piece of Wesley Heights.",

You won't find the exact CM deli menu here so embrace it as a chance to find a new favorite. High quality breads, meats & cheeses with plenty of vegetarian options remain at core.  The space is new so it lacks the gritty character of PM or Southend but I'm sure it's own decor & identity will come with time. There's a paper bag of \"good ideas\" for a suggestion box if you find anything lacking. There's seating inside of a couple tables and a booth & two bars with stools.

    "text": "3.5 STARS I came here for lunch on Monday and I cant say that I was all that impressed. I understand the whole concept -- and I enjoy it very much. Just like a lot of people said: it has that common market-ish feel to the place. The sandwich I had was just ok. It wasn't \"out of this world, good\"....but it wasn't \"I wont eat here again, awful\". Know what I mean?   I like that they have a some local beers on tap and they do have a pretty big selection of beer. However, I don't think I'll ever purchase bottle or canned beer here unless they have something that I can't find anywhere else since they do overprice there beers so much. You'll save 20-30% if you can find it an Harris Teeter. $10.99 for Shiner Holiday Cheer when Harris Teeter carries it for $7.99, cmon brooo? Like Heather M. says, \"insanely high prices on random things\" while other prices are reasonable. Remember those small Frito bags your mom would pack in your lunch? Like the Tiny bags? Those are $1.49... yeah =/  Deli: When it comes to word Deli, I take it very seriously. I expect to see cold cuts, all different types of salads, spreads, hot dishes, etc. The deli here is kind of a walkup counter. You place your order, then they kind of disappear into the back and call your # when its ready. Maybe I'm just expecting a NY type deli and those probably don't exist down here.   My experience on Monday: I ordered a Sicilian sandwich with NO TOMATO. The guy asked if I wanted it hot or cold. I took a second to respond since I was putting some thought into it and he quickly said \"we recommend it cold\".  So that's what I got - Sicilian w/ no tomato, cold. I get back to my office and go to eat my lunch and I realized that they made my sandwich HOT and there was TOMATO on it. So I picked the tomatoes out of it and ate it. The sandwich was decent, but I much rather had it cold and my bread not be all soggy from the tomato that turned to mush. Listen, mistakes are bound to happen every now and then...I'm not here to bash anyone. I just expect that when I order something for the order to be right.  They are conveniently located near my office and I'm sure I will eat here again since our options in the area are pinkys, picante, burger co...etc. Hopefully, my first experience here was just a fluke and they'll get my orders right in the future.",

Inside they have lots of canned and bottled beverages and tons of snacks (including popsicles from King of Pops). There is a deli at the back of the store and they have various sandwiches and salads. Lots of vegetarian options! Both my husband and I got the BBQ Tofu sandwich.   When the sandwiches came out they were very nice portions. The bbq tofu was abslutely delish. It was almost a bahn mi style with pickled veggies in it. Super delish. After we finished our meal, the owner came by to ask how our meals were, which was a nice touch!",

I had the La Mode(Spell Check lol) breakfast sandwich that came on sourdough bread, spinach, egg, tomato and light cheese. I also got the steel cut oats with fruit. Really good stuff...I will definitely be back.",

Beer and wine selection is great..Everyone working there was awesome as well...except for one lady that took my money was bitchy and had a horrible personality, but I'm not gonna let her ruin my experience. Maybe I just caught her on a bad day. I've been a few times now and I will definitely go back again and again.",

    "text": "I'm primarily here to discuss a quality vegetarian sandwich.   The Tofu You is so so good. It's a hot sandwich with tofu, bbq sauce, pickled veggies, served on some buttery grilled toast. I feel that often the vegetarian sandwich is created for a menu as an after thought. That no one intends it to be ordered or enjoyed. I feel whoever put this on the menu really thought about someone actually eating it! Honestly, this is the only menu item I've ever gotten, but there is a whole host of meat free sandwich choices. My boyfriend usually orders the Club and he enjoys it, but today even he agreed that I out ordered him!    The market itself has a bunch of great stuff too. Huge selection of cold drinks and chips. All around great place for lunch, especially if you are looking for a tasty meat free sandwich.",

    "text": "Met up with a friend here for lunch during the week. This Deli part is very vegetarian friendly. The line you place your order goes pretty quick so you gotta know what you want and not take forever to overthink the menu. I went with the Tofu You. I would definitely order it again. It's simple and packs a lot flavor that you savor. Not too damaging to the wallet. Service is friendly and a little rushed, but during lunch it's expected. There is seating outside, great if the weather permits.",
