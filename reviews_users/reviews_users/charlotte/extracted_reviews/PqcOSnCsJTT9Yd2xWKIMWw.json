No one wants microwaved kunefe, it's soggy and the cheese becomes congealed and too chewy. Why would you microwave kunefe at a restaurant? Give us a warning! :/ The beauty of kunefe is crunchy on top with melty cheese between and drowned in rose water simple syrup.  Nothing is better than putting your fork into the first piece and hearing that crunch! What a disappointment to an already lackluster meal.",

I usually get a wrap and the veggie plate. The chicken shawarma is always cooked perfectly and has wonderful flavor while still being tender. The veggie plate is a HUGE amount of food, which I get to share with at least one other person. The lintel soup is so tasty, and welcome in the cold months. The price is right, especially for the quality and quantity of food and the owner is one of the nicest I've had the pleasure of talking to in Charlotte. If you're not eating here, you're doing it wrong.",

My partner and I both had the lamb kabob wrap.  Inside, the lamp was so tender and wonderfully flavored.  I can't quite figure out what the spices are.  The hummus and the veggies inside were delicious.  I also had the falafel - I just loved the flavor, and the texture was perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.    My decor inside was not much, of course- just a few tables you can sit at.  Very plain decor and limited seating, but it's a good place to get take away.  The prices are very affordable; our wraps were $5 each and we got an 8 count falafel for $4.  All our food was made fresh while we waited.  The staff was quite friendly and helpful.  I'm excited about going back soon.",

I give it 3 stars, because the food was good enough, but not amazing. Ordered lamb kabob, lamb gyro with fries,, and baba ganoush. The lamb kabob was full of flavor, and the meat was very tender. Could've used a little more meat in the sandwich, but nothing to complain about. The lamb gyro was good, nothing out of the usual. The fries however that came with it were soggy and undercooked. The best thing was the baba ganoush. They also offer prepared foods and desserts like baklava as well as other Lebanese canned and dry foods.",

They just recently opened up another side to have more seating (like over double than what was in there before). IT IS NOT FANCY. So don't go in there on your high horse. It's all about speed with them and I appreciate that. Ask them anything if you have questions or don't know what something is. You get huge portions. Just give them your order, go grab a drink from the cooler and pick a table. The owner is really nice, he has a huge family so I am happy to see their success in this spot, it is always busy (hence why the expanded.)  My fave is that bomb hummus with some grilled chicken, delicious!",

    "text": "Talk about authentic! The owners are from Jerusalem, and there's a tiny menu board at the front of the shop, where menu items are spelled out in Arabic in bright chalk.    Prices are super cheap, and you get a lot of food.   There isn't much ambiance here, and that's OK.  It's a small joint in a strip center featuring some ethnic food marts and just down the street are some check-cashing shops. It's an easily overlooked restaurant. There are also no formal menus, just paper fold-out ones.   The falafel here truly is one of the best I've had in Charlotte.  Very crispy and not too herbacious (Kabob Grill is one of my faves, but the falafel can sometimes be too green inside.) The falafel wrap is only $3! It comes with tahini and some slivers of red onion. The 8 pieces for our appetizer were just $3.99.   I got the hommous and shwarma platter with the house salad.  The salad of thinly shredded lettuce, cucumbers, red onion and dressing was a nice pairing to the rich and creamy hommous in olive oil. The dish (photo enclosed) was enormous and $7.99.   BTW: You can buy an entire roast chicken (a-la Costco style) seasoned with their own mix of herbs and spices, for $7.99!  For $24, you can get a 4 piece meal to take home, which features 2 whole chickens!   What I loved was the variety of people who walked through the doors during my lunch.  Police officers, men in business suits, small kids.    Keep in mind, there is no sweet tea/iced tea.  Just canned sodas, some juices and drinks written in Arabic, and waters.    In addition to dessert (which was a pisachio pastry in flaky phyllo, not as sticky and over sweet as baklava...just the right portion size, about the size of a half-dollar coin) they sell meat pastries and buns.   I'm not in this neighborhood often, but when the craving for Middle Eastern strikes, I'll be back!",

Don't be afraid of the lack of glamour--this place has heart and the food is cooked with lots of love and clearly cherished recipes. This is authentic Middle Eastern food with hard working staff and chefs who were so kind.   The flavors of the food were impeccable....shout out to the tabbouli (so fresh) and the richness of the way they prepare all of their meats. The portions are substantial. I would love to try some of their Friday specials sometime. I highly recommend the meat pies. I had plenty of food to bring home, and I know I'll be visiting again when I need my fix of Middle Eastern food.",

If you are there for quality food and do not mind that the eye will see some greasy cooking and a bit rundown environment than you are in for a treat. This place is as authentic as it can get. Unfortunately, it is not located close to my place, but I think about this place a lot and cannot wait to return. They serve wonderful shwarma sandwiches even with pickles in them, the way I am used to it from the Lebanese places I used to eat at in Berlin. Great prices and many different options. The staff is super friendly. There are not many tables, but it is always possible to get a spot. There are also a few tables outdoor, however, it is not equipped for large groups.  I love this place and will continue to return and highly recommend the food quality and options in terms of Middle Eastern food.",

    "text": "DAMN YOU EXPECTATIONS!  After all these raving reviews, I dragged my newly-found-food-loving boyfriend past my usual quickie hole in the wall middle eastern place on Central Ave. to try out this new hole in the wall for an early dinner.  The place looks promising as we walked in: small, nothing fancy, and a table of middle eastern diners... my thought was, SCORE!  With all the options it was hard to make a decision.  But I was determined to try the lentil soup so I ended up getting the half roast chicken with 2 sides, one side being the soup and the other being the special rice ($7.99).  He ordered a falafel sandwich wrap ($2.99) and a chicken chicken shawarma sandwich wrap ($3.99).  Lentil soup was different, almost has a hint of squash taste, plus it's my first non-green lentil soup, but it was otherwise yummy and perfect for an unexpected day of cold weather.  Then the rest of the food arrived.  The 2 sandwich wraps were huge for the price... but disappointingly they had more fillers (tomato/cucumber/etc.) than the meat and the sauce so the taste got washed off a little.  The falafel one was definitely better; it was perfectly crispy fried and well seasoned.  Meanwhile my half chicken and rice looked impressive.  I swear there's enough rice to feed a family of four on the plate.  But as I forked my way into the chicken, it was unbelievably DRY!  I seriously could not even eat the wing because it was bone dry.  The skin looked yummy golden brown but lacked flavor... so if the skin had no flavor, imagine how bland the meat was.  It's so dry that even the dark meat was getting tough, which I didn't even think was possible.  What a let down :(  The only saving grace of my plate was the garlic sauce... it looked like a lump of mayo, but it was garlic-y.  I smeared it all over everything to give my plate some much needed taste.  Since it's my 1st visit, I am not going to write it off yet.  I think next time I'll give their kafta a try.  But my suggestion is to stay away from the chicken.  The only other high point of yesterday's visit was the discovery of a newly open Nile Grocery and Ethiopian Restaraunt sign that was being put up as I was fighting a losing battle with my chicken.",

    "text": "What the dining area in this tiny strip-mall restaurant lacks in ambiance is made up in spades by the fresh and authentic flavors of the Middle East.  Truly this is a diamond in the rough, worth seeking out for well-known favorites like hommos, tabouli, and falafel.  In many senses, walking into LSK is no different from walking into an American deli.  A couple glass cases hold cold salads and meats.  There is a fryer and grill behind there.  A small case behind the register holds desserts.  Tables are basic and laminated menus are plentiful.    A closer look, though, tells you this is something different.  First off, the meats in the coolers are skewered on what looks like large swords.  Large skewers rotate on the grill over a gas flame.  Cold salads include tabouli, hommos and baba ganoush.  For my first venture in, I made lunch out of an order of falafel and stuffed grape leaves.  I watched as 8 small patties were scooped with a small tool and fried fresh before me.  They came out so hot that I couldn't close the container they were served in.  A quick taste proves what others have said- just the right mix of chewy texture inside with a crisp outside.  Moist and flavorful, these were a home run.  Stuffed grape leaves were perfectly portioned and came with a lemon-like dipping sauce.  These were slightly pungent by themselves, but the lemon sauce punched them up perfectly, like a counter-weight, adding some acid to the mix to balance the flavors.  I'd have some more, please.  Though I skipped it, the hommos looked creamy and fresh, and even the small order seemed enormous on the plates of other diners.  Wraps with shwarma or kafka looked huge and give me something to consider next time.  There are also daily lunch specials the owner, Izzat, will happily show you.  Braised lamb shank looked strong once unveiled, if that's you thing.  Gotta love the mix of regional flavors coming out of East Charlotte right now.  Asian, Latin American, Indian, and Middle Eastern: all are well-represented here.  Now if only it weren't such a trek to go explore.  Luckily, LSK makes it worth the trip.",

    "text": "Since I moved to Charlotte I have been craving a tasty, dirt cheap falafel sandwich. I had recently caught wind that this neighborhood was blossoming with Middle Eastern choices, and La Shish Kebob was exactly what I had been hoping for. For $3 you get a decent (not generous but also not stingy) serving of falafel surrounded by tomatoes, mint (at least I could have sworn it was mint), tahini, onion, pickled cucumbers and peppers. All of it is wrapped like a burrito in a pita bread. Could it have used a healthy dose of hot sauce (and I don't mean the Texas Pete they had sitting on the table), yes. but it was utterly delicious without.   The restaurant is pretty standard for a strip mall outpost. I stayed to eat but that was just because I didn't trust myself to make it home without digging in. The gentleman behind the counter was helpful and let me know that they didn't have takeout menus in yet but they would on Monday. That's good news because as soon as I got home I was checking to see if I can make it to La Shish Kebob and back on my lunch hour...I can!",

I'll frequently drive 50 miles round trip to get carryout here.  Portions are huge, and even splitting with another person will leave you with leftovers for later.  Love the atmosphere, which reminds me of the real thing in the middle east.  Full of young Arabic families or groups of men picking apart roast chickens with their hands.  Arab TV channels on the telly.  Feels like you're in  Dubai.   Good bread from the Syrian bakery down the street.  Go there for freshest deserts.  Don't overeat, because the food is heavy in lamb fat-- which though delicious-- can be difficult on unfamiliar Western tummies.  Owner very friendly and helpful, as is everyone else who works there.

Seriously, this place is open late, the service is friendly, the food is amazing, and it is cheap. I have never eaten in because lets be real who wants to eat a kebab in a shop when you could have it on your couch with Netflix?   The beef is charred and tasty, the tahini is on point, and the tabouli is to die for. Seriously check this place out! I'm curious about their sweets, those will definitely be on my to do list for next time.",

    "text": "My husband ate at La shish kabob today. I need to preface this review by saying that I have been spoiled because I grew up in a middle eastern community in Detroit eating some of the best middle eastern food outside of the middle east.  I know that all middle eastern food it not alike. La Shish Kabob had just opened the first time that I ate there and this review was written after my second visit. Both times my opinions were the same. I just did not feel the food was fresh or health enough. And perhaps it was what I ordered. The first time, the saw the older guy on the grill take the grease with his spatula from the fries and throw it on the shredded chicken on the grill. This time, I played it safe and ordered the Gyro and fries for lunch. The gyro meat was the processed, lunchmeat kind. It was very salty. Everything had lots of red onions. It had very little tzatziki sauce. It's just not the fresh, healthy middle eastern food that I am accustomed to... Sorry! I just do not rate this place highly and would not recommend it to friends. It's a greasy spoon that takes a the kind of short cuts that could they could never get away with in Detroit because there is just too much competition there. Here in Charlotte, they can get away with it. It's okay if you want to get your Middle eastern fix though.  I did not like the service either. Could not even get a cup of ice water. Will not be back.",

The food is EXCEPTIONAL! The best hummus I've ever had, shawarma is phenomenal, and we recently tried the chicken shabousk (?) which is now one of our favorites. It may not be \"authentic\" but the chicken philly is also something we crave all the time. You should try La Shish Kabob!",

The owner is such a friendly person, greets every time we go there and its so genuine and welcoming.  ok the food, obviously they have great shawrmas, falafels, hummus, various kabobs, baklava etc., but to me the one thing that stands out is the Lamb Shank.  God damn, yes its fatty, full of cholesterol and thousands of calories but trust me, it is worth everything.  I always have the Lamb Shanks with Maklouba rice, not always but as often as possible.  We usually get the whole chicken and rice or chicken kabobs for dinner.  They have expanded recently and have a much bigger dining space than few months before. All this for a very very decent price, its the best Mediterranean place around.",

There have been a few times lately that the chicken has been a little dry, but I remedy that with an extra helping of their garlic sauce and the lemon-olive oil concoction on the tables.   The lamb shank is stewed and it falls off the bone.  The lentil soup is delicious.  They have menu items like burgers, Philly cheesesteaks, lamb cheesesteak, etc. and I'd advise you to stay away.",

Falling off the bone good, seasoned so well I decided not to add anything to them. In a fancier restaurant in a different location that alone would be $30 or more, but here it was about $12. This was my first time there, but it's going to be a regular stop from now on.",

    "text": "I was so excited to see this place had such great reviews. I haven't found really really good Lebanese/Mediterranean/middle eastern food in charlotte and I've pretty much tried them all (Jasmine Grill is probably the best so far). This was my last hope.    Unfortunately, my visit was combination of all the bad reviews on this place. Just my luck.  I called my order in and had a bit of difficulty understanding the guy on the other end bc he was so short and muffled with his responses. Okay whatever, we got through it.  I went in and expected the owner to be really nice based on reviews.  He was actually an impatient jerk.   He changed one of the items I ordered saying it's almost the same so I asked what I ended up getting. Expecting this food to be amazing, I wanted to know so that I could reorder the right item next time. Wow you'd think this guy would be even MODERATELY polite when getting a reasonable question. Whatever. I can deal with a gruff jerk for good food.   Yeah well not. The shawarma wrap was dry as my heel in the winter and completely tasteless.  What?!?!??  How can this be?  Then went onto the mixed grill.  :(. WTH. So dry. Everything. Rice meats all so so dry. Only flavors were salt and too much of that. I try to smother it with the garlic (how can garlic sauce be so tasteless????) and hot sauce.  I took one bite of the salad and spit it out. The tomatoes were old and mushy. The whole salad was tasteless and old. The tabouli was also old. One bite and I had to spit it out. It was so old it had actually started the fermentation process!!!!!  Finally I stopped realizing I was basically eating junk.  The ONLY decent thing we tried was the Falafel. It was pretty good.  Good but falafel alone isn't reason for me to come back to be treated like crap for dry salty low quality food.  So either I got unlucky and the GROUCH served me the worst dry tasteless leftovers or others who give this a great review have never had really good Lebanese.",

I prefer the gyro carved from the spit, but this was not.  The pita was fresh and the cucumber salad was yummy along with the sauce.  My wife had the New York schwarma and loved the flavors.  She said it was different from others she's had, but very good.  My son had the ground beef  kabob and loved it.   I had some too excellent flavor.  My wife and I enjoyed the lentil soup, but my son did not.  The owner was very nice.  The location is busy, not the best location in a strip mall.  The decor is pretty minimal and the buffet tables take up the back of the restaurant even when not in use.  Maybe a good carryout place, but not a terrible place to eat.  The food makes it all worth it.",

Then main dish chicken kabobs came before I could even take one bite of my salad. Had to try and find waitress to get more water. The same for more pita bread. Chicken kabobs were absolutely horrible. They were extremely dry chunks of chicken that were also difficult to chew. The taste of the kabobs was not good at all. Some raisins were hard as rocks. What raisins that were not hard and the rice were unfortunately the best parts of the whole meal. We kept waiting for our check so long the receptionist finally came up and asked if we needed our check. A small discount for the bad bobs was given, but not nearly enough. Will never go back to this place. Save your money. The rating of one is a gift and higher than deserved. Bypass this place.",

    "text": "Every time I visit my family in Charlotte, we always seem to stumble upon some fun strip mall with a bunch nondescript ethnic restaurants. Last Monday afternoon was no different, and we found ourselves at La Shish Kebob.   As soon as we walked inside, we had a good feeling about the place. The guys behind the counter were jovial, the TV was blaring news in a language neither of us understood, and there were a ton of beverages in the fridge case that neither of us recognized.   My cousin got a lamb kebab wrap, and I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. We shared an app plate of hummus, kibbeh, and falafel.   Everything was just fantastic. The hummus was some of the best I've had, and the large pita was warm and fresh. The falafel was superb: crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and obviously fried to order. The kibbeh, which I'd never tried, was also outstanding: to me, it was like the Middle Eastern version of arancini, and I loved it. The meat was spiced well and the rice was not dry or crunchy.   Cousin loved his lamb kebab wrap; I enjoyed my shawarma wrap as well. The chicken was a little dry, but it wasn't anything the hot sauce, lemon-garlic sauce, and garlic mayo couldn't fix. It also came with fries, which were nothing spectacular, but went well with the garlic mayo (and really, you don't go to a kebab place for the fries!).   Price was more than reasonable and the portions were generous.   The service was also fantastic; not sure if the guy serving and ringing us up was the owner, but he was very nice and very enthusiastic about everything. We thanked him profusely before waddling our fat asses back to the car.",

    "text": "We used to live right around the corner several years ago and drove by it all the time, but never stopped.  I used to live in Washington, DC and loved the kabob places (Moby Dick, for one) there and was looking to find a favorite here in Charlotte.  As has been mentioned, this is a little deli looking place in a small, old strip center.  Neighborhood has been a downward slide for years (even though we enjoyed living over here), but location and physical appearance shouldn't be a determining factor when choosing specialty cuisine.  This is a more traditional kabob stop than you might find in Dilworth or Ballantyne.  It's very traditional with a very good menu.  We always choose the mixed grill kabobs with the special rice (includes grilled eggplant) and a salad with a nice lemon dressing.  Lots of food and the meat is always cooked just right.  This was not what I was looking for originally to match what I used to get in Washington, DC, which was much different fare, but it has been a nice discovery.  Kabobs aren't kabobs everywhere with the different ethnic regions each having their unique styles and ingredients.  This still very much fits the bill for what we were looking for and we will continue to come here for a good meal.",

No excellence, but when I want a cheap meal that isn't a traditional sandwich, I'll always be happy to go back there. The Tabouleh is veeerry lemony - some like it that way, I personally don't.   The owner is very friendly, and when I was digging for cash the other day, he offered that I could just pay next time I came in. Five stars on the service.",

    "text": "This place is my JAM! Thankfully, I'm located less than 2 minutes from this little gem of a place and since discovering it on 9/29, I've been 6 times. That's right - 6 times in 8 days.  I can't get enough of their falafel wrap, and let me explain why:  1. 2.99 - with tax, total comes out to $3.64 2. Falafel is so moist, yet perfectly fried - it's a miracle and sin all in one 3. The salad they put on it is always fresh, light and cool 4. Please see #1 & #2 5. Izzat is always there and while I can't understand a word of what he says over the phone, when I walk in he is always smiling and asking after my health (Perhaps he wants to be sure I am in good health so I can continue to put his kids through college thanks to the rate at which he sees me). 6. Please see #1-5  So yes, I am in LURVE with this place and you should definitely try it. I've also had the grape leaves (good, salty though!), the hummos (home run, all the way, amazing) and the Babaganoush (yummy). An accomplice on one of my visits tried the Chicken wrap and before I could ask for a bite it was gone, so that also says something ;)  As others have said, don't let the shanty strip mall it's in get you down - this really is a very real, honest establishment that appears to really hold onto their roots and rock the Casbah of tastebuds in my mouth!",

I opted for the app sampler (I picked hommus, stuffed grape leaves, and kibbeh), a small order of the falafel, and a combo shish kabob plate with rice and salad. The only item I had ever had before was the grape leaves and hommus. It was life changing! Kibbeh is my new favorite food. They look like giant hush puppies but are stuffed with meat and almonds and a mind-blowing amount of flavor. The rice was delicious and the grilled meats on top were perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to go back!!",

When we pulled up outside of the strip mall where this place is located, I was less excited.  Stepping inside your eyes won't be impressed, but your nose will, and soon, so will your tastebuds.  Nothing fancy about this joint, but the food is outstanding (they were actually cooking an authentic Jordanian dish as a lunch special) and the service is warm.  I tried the Shwarma meal, which is two slightly grilled pitas stufed with chicken shwarma, veggies, and a cool sauce served with slaw and fries.  Really good.  Coworkers ordered chicken shish kabob wraps and kafta wraps.  Both claimed they were outstanding.  The hummus at the table behind us looked great, too.   Maybe the best part, though, is that the meal was cheap.  Ridiculously cheap.    You can even grab seasoned rotisserie chickens in a family deal to go...something like two chickens, rice, a side (I think) for something like $24.  Not a bad deal.  If they were located on East Blvd, they would have a line out the door every day during lunch and could charge twice as much.  Not very many places to sit inside, so arrive in an \"off\" time or plan on getting it to go.  Great work.  Looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "Since I've moved to Charlotte three years ago (from southeastern Michigan), I have been in search of a place like this.  I have settled for mediocre Middle Eastern places in Charlotte to satisfy my cravings, but now La Shish Kabob is here for fresh, flavorful, reasonably priced Mediterranean cuisine.  I came in on a whim during Ramadan.  The place was packed with families seated at tables connected together who were served family-style.  They were beyond busy, and I should've known better.  I came just at the moment they were all breaking fast.  In the midst of waiters rushing to serve their guests, a friend of the owners (I presumed) got up and took my order preceded by an offering to try a fig...which I took.  Yum.  They later offered me a stuffed grape leaf while I was waiting for my order.  Double yum.  I ordered a sampling of food: falafel, kibbeh, chicken shwarma, hommos, baba ghanouj, and three honey-coated pastries that had a cream filling.  Everything was tasty, subtle flavors of fresh herbs, large portions, very filling...yummy leftovers.  So, Charlotteans, let's keep this new eatery open.  Try it out.  You won't be disappointed. It's worth it, I promise.    If you're new to Middle Eastern cuisine, this will be a great introduction. Looking for a new take out to bring home that won't burn a whole in your wallet?  This is your place.  You are also looking for the \"real deal\"? Head there now : )",

You will probably come back a few days later, it is that good. The lamb on rice, OMG. It is a huge portion, so go in hungry. And the flavor is like no other, incredible. The Fattoush salad is amazing. Get the Family Meal and go for a picnic then play some disc golf and go back and get the Lamb Shank. Well worth the drive from Cornelius. We miss this joint.",

    "text": "It was late on that hot and muggy Carolina Friday, and most places were closed, but their sign caught my eye. The smell of falafel was a delicious draw, so we decided to stop in.   This is not a restaurant. This is a hub.   The small restaurant was full of good sights, smells, and the chatter of friendly people in languages I didn't understand. Women in headscarves talked animatedly to eachother while scooping up laughing children to sit on their laps. Families talked to all tables as they sat down to delicious food.  Behind the counter, herbed beef, chicken, and lamb sizzled as music from Jerusalem sounded over the system.   Meet Izzat. He opened La Shish Kabob about two months ago after moving his family here from Jerusalem. When he invites you into his restaurant, it's like he's inviting you into his home. We gladly took a seat.  SERVICE: Astounding. Very pleasant and hospitable, and when I realized that I had accidentally ordered something with onions and green peppers (my friend is allergic), they instantly made another one and apologized even though it was my err. Instead of the original lamb kebab that was ordered, he made something that was a little different to better suit my friend's food requirements, without even being asked. And it was delicious.  FOOD: If you've never experienced good Middle Eastern food, experience it here. They have all of the classics, from falafel to baba ghannouj. The tabouli was out of this world (so much better than I make, I'm going to have to snag his recipe), with that clean and fresh parsley, lemon and olive oil flavor.  The kebab wraps (chicken and lamb) were flavorful and huge. They also sell the brand of mango nectar there that tastes like you're drinking a whole mango. Delicious. The baklavah and other goodies in the case looked mouth-watering, but I was too full. That comes on round 2.  PRICE: This is the awesome part. A heaping portion of tabouli for two, two lamb kebab wraps, one chicken kebab wrap, and 4 mango drinks comes out to: $26. So cheap for not only the portion size, but the quality and freshness as well.  When you walk into this place, you can feel that it's good people. If you stay, you'll quickly realize that it's good people, AND great food. When it's all over, you'll also see that it's all for a really affrodable price. I highly suggest giving this place some love, because it's one of the few places that will give it back.",

Sharon Amity Rd & Albermarle Rd area, but is surrounded by other restaurants and markets catering to the Middle Eastern community.  The food is reasonably priced and tastes superb.  The Turkish coffee is well worth a try as well, although don't expect it to be similar to your run of the mill stuff --- which is precisely why it's good.  I've been here 3 times, but only been able to eat there twice.  Before going the first time, I called to make sure they would be open late and was told they would be open until 11pm (not midnight like on the Yelp page).  When we got there all of the chairs and tables were outside and they were ripping up the floor and they were obviously closed for the evening.  This was at 10pm on Valentine's day, but while we were disappointed we were still undeterred.  The next couple times we had the tabbouleh which was quite good, but like another poster said it is pretty lemony and also has a lot more liquid in it than one's I've previously had.  It is still very good though.  It comes with a pita, but we had to remind the guy the first time after which he gave us one pita (not enough) and the second time we automatically got two.     We also had the combination kebab plate with rice which was really good.  The second time we went my GF really wanted the rice (she loved it) and asked the guy if he could just sell us some rice, but he said that he couldn't and that since he isn't the owner he couldn't make the choice.  (we secretly wondered about that since he's always there and sometimes has his family there! haha, but oh well!)  The hummus/hommos is also good.  We also had a schwarma and a falafel our second time eating there and really liked them both.  Our Middle Eastern friend who joined us was a little ambivalent to it all so I still am not sure what he thought of it.  A lot of Middle Easterners frequent this place which is a good sign.  I really liked the food and I am dying to go back.  The people are hospitable and the prices reasonable.  The place's decor is no frills, but when the food is that good you don't need to dress things up.",

Each item is perfectly prepared with a great mixture of spices and flavors.  The one tip I will share in this review is that all Mediterranean food is very similar, but it's also very different. So if you're looking for a specific dish you might not find it here because while it's Mediterranean food, it's really Lebanese. This creates dishes with slightly different spices but still a delight for any Mediterranean food lover.",

    "text": "This is definitely one of those places that make me grateful for Yelp, because I never would have found it without it. I would give it 5 stars for service, value, grilled kabobs, buttery delicious baklava and hommos.  The chicken was really well-seasoned and perfectly cooked (often kabobs can be burnt and cardboardy). We were really pleased with our meals that were so reasonably priced.  What deducted a star for me is the odd deli ambiance with trays of food sitting out as well as the baba ghanoush which missed the mark for me. Perhaps it is the traditional way they prepare it in Jerusalem, but I prefer the more Greek/Morroccan way with more eggplant/lemon than creamy white stuff. Yeah, I said it. No creamy white stuff for me. (Good thing I'm never running for office.)  I got three pieces of baklava for the office mates to go which were a major crowd pleaser. They were more buttery than typical Greek baklava than I've had, but I really enjoyed it.   A great alternative if you're stuck in the midlands of Charlotte at a car dealership and your food tank is running on empty. I'll definitely be back.",

The place itself looked shabby but it had a lot of people there eating so we decided to give it a try because of the great reviews on Yelp.  We ordered our food at the register and payed for it.  Then I noticed that the cook was handling the money with gloves on but then goes back to cooking without changing gloves!!  I was pretty grossed out but I figured we had already paid for the food so I was going to eat it and pray that we don't get sick from it!  The food was not that great!  We barely ate any of it!!  Then after we had finished we went back to our car and we were sitting there for a minute in the parking lot looking up directions and the cook knocks on our car window!  We opened the door and he says \"You not pay me!\"  So we told him that we payed when we ordered the food and then he just walked away!  What a strange experience!!",

Still shaking my head over this one.   So this is the second time (mind you in a row) that my order was horrible. And now, they screwed up my mothers order -- she is 100 times worse than I when it comes to food, but we both behave the same... once,  okay we will try it again... twice, more than like not again. And if we decided to try it again, it will be a day far away.    I ordered the Arabic Shawarma chicken wrap (both times) and it was bland ass boring and last night out right gross. If I wanted plain chicken thrown on a flat grill with no seasoning, I could of did that myself thank you. And the tahini -- was that mayo or tahini... BOTH TIMES. Argh.   My mother ordered the Lamb Kebob's and the cook added so much hot sauce she couldn't eat it. Mind you she loves hot sauce, but on a Lamb kebob, that should be the customers choice, not the cook going rogue! (the Kebob, which she always orders has NEVER had hot sauce on it before)   And the hommos... smh... there was so much sumac, it was inedible. It was so bitter.   What a shame... I love their prices and I did love the flavor. My mom thinks its the cook... the young one is not supervised, where the older one understands the flavor and seasoning level.   Only reason it got two stars is because my fathers order was ok -- he got the vegetarian wrap.   Another one bites the dust.",

Rarely can I even open the door myself before Izzat is there, flinging it open, welcoming us in with a big smile and warm greetings. He is truly a Charlotte gem, adding not only great food but out of this world hospitality and kindness to our community. If the restaurant isn't totally packed when you visit, take some time to chat with Izzat and learn his story about moving his restaurant (and family) from Jerusalem to east Charlotte. It's one of resiliency and hard work that will make you love him and La Shish even more than you did before.   Once inside, I always have order anxiety as the smells of slow roasting shawarma and kabobs envelope me. It's impossible not to order hummus, so just go ahead and plan on that. Freshly made and creamy, with olive oil drizzled on top, it's the stuff dreams are made of. I also love the babaganoush (roasted eggplant spread/dip) and tabbouleh (minced parsley, mint, olive oil, and who knows what else goodness), and falafel. Oh, the falafel! Also totally dreamy. In case you're not full just reading this, the chicken shawarma is also delish and served with french fries that are perfect to dip in the garlic mayo. So, pretty much, just order one of everything and plan to take a lot home to snack on for days after.",

    "text": "All these raving reviews are 100% right!   Tried La Shish Kabob for the first time last night. I've been curious after seeing it rated as one of the best places to get hummus in Charlotte by Charlotte Agenda.  We ordered the following items:  Hummos Dip Appetizer Grape Leaves Appetizer  Kofta Kabob Wrap Mixed Grilled Kabob Entree  Everything was so delicious! The hummos dip was served with huge pieces of fresh pita, we had our food delivered by Ubereats--I can only imagine how good the pita is when served right there. Very tasty and very much deserving of it's title as one of the best in Charlotte.  Grape Leaves were served cold, which I prefer--I've had them warm and wasn't as big of a fan. Stuffed with rice, tomato and parsley they were really yummy. Appetizer comes with 6 in it.  Kofta Kabob Wrap was HUGE--wrapped in warm pita and served with with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and hummus. Was especially great with the hot sauce provided.   Mixed Grilled Kabob Entree was the absolutely favorite. You get to try chicken, lamb and kofta served on a giant bed of rice. The portion size was insane, had it for lunch today! This is also served with a fresh small salad.  Try this place out, you won't regret it! Price was low and portions were big!",

    "text": "The food here is amazing! The falafel, baba ghanosh, and hummus are delicious! I frequented this restaurant until today--I will never spend my money here again!!!  I ordered food over my lunch break for a friend to pick up. The other day I asked if I could get tabbouleh included on my falafel wrap w/ fries and the owner's daughter told me of course! The flavors were amazing. Today, I inquired whether I could do it again and the employee either did not understand or did not want to do it (they told me they don't speak English), so I just forgot about it. I eat the wrap without it any other day, right? When my friend brings the food, the pita was stale, the falafel was super mushy like it had been undercooked, the fries were old tasting. Since my break was ending, I called the store to speak of my experience given me eating there often (within the past seven days at least 3 times) to let them know I was unsatisfied. The employee asked me if I wanted a refund or the food made over. I went with the refund given I had not enjoyed the food and did not want to take a second chance for the day.   My friend goes to get the refund and calls me frustrated because the owner tells him that he would not give a refund without the food. By this point since the employee had told us to just come get the refund and not mentioned the food, it had been disposed of. I called while at work to speak to the owner. He accuses me of wanting my money back because I didn't get tabbouleh on my wrap!! I have eaten here for over FIVE years and have NEVER complained about an item. At this point I tell the owner that I don't have the food and since we were told that I could have a refund that I should be given one. He repeatedly said things that left just as bad as a taste in my mouth as the food he'd served us. I hung up.   Once I got off work, I went back to the restaurant to speak to the owner myself. He told us we were playing games and he would not give us the money back. I told him I would not leave until I got my refund at the point because I was being accused of things that made absolutely no sense. I begin leaning on his counter and he tells me to have a seat and I could stay there as long as I wanted and I told him I'd be there until I got my money back.   What did he do?  HE CALLED THE POLICE ON ME AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF WHAT I WOULD DO TO HIM. I have video footage of the encounter that shows me leaning against his counter and him sticking his hand in my face. I am a 23 y/o woman and he is too old with a DAUGHTER THAT WORKS THERE to be treating someone else's daughter that way. I was appalled. He begins to move his tip jars because he said I was probably going to try to steal from him even after I'VE GIVEN HIM MY MONEY AND RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE FOR YEARS.   Ultimately, I received more back than I paid because one of his other loyal customers were mad I sent business away. Not my problem. I'm sure he will reimburse his customer, yet treated me terribly. I told him I was writing this review and he told me to tell the whole story so I hope he sees this.",

Comes with hummus, baba ganoosh, falafel, a salad, and grape leaves with rice and other items, then pita on the side. It was all excellent and quite a bit of food - enough for me to take leftovers home and I love leftovers.   The only thing that was a little frustrating was that when asked for a little taziki for a dipping sauce, I was told it would be quite a bit extra (not sure how much). Now I wasn't as frustrated when I saw that giant bowl they brought out.",

While I don't normally opt for buffets, I've had very little experience with Mediterranean food and the little experience I've had honestly left me with no desire to ever eat this type of food again. Luckily, my brother-in-law convinced me that I'd be doing myself a disservice if I didn't give this place a try. I tried everything on the buffet and there was not one thing I didn't enjoy. My favorites were cauliflower, a potatoe dish stuffed with ground meat (sorry don't know what it's called), the lentil rice and the Lebanon salad. The flavors were rich and the food gave you that good home cooked feel! The food hands down earns this place 4 stars on my book. I must mention that the service was almost non existent. We walked in and were told to grab a seat and enjoy the buffet. As first timers we were unaware that you have to go get your own drink from the refrigerated cooler. We finally figured that out after plate #2 when we were quite parched. There were also no labels on the buffet so guess that food was the game of the evening. I will eat at this restaurant again because the food was simply delicious even though I am not certain of what all I ate.",

It is easily overlooked, mostly because it's in a tiny little strip mall between a barber shop and an Ethiopian grocery/restaurant. There isn't much in the way of ambiance, but I don't really feel it's necessary. You go for the food, not because it's nice to look at or a fun place to chill.   The owner is always welcoming and friendly, even when they're packed. And, they're packed more often than not.   I've had most things on the menu and all if it is pretty good. Though, sometimes it is better than others. I much prefer popping into Shish rather than some greasy fast food spot. The food is fresh, homemade, and tastes great. Some favorite repeats of mine: lamb kabob wrap, tabbouleh, falafel wrap, vegetarian combo, chicken shawarma, & kibbeh.   I will say that their desserts are just okay. If you want something better, check out Golden Bakery next door or the Halal Market across the street. Oh, but their coffee is pretty great.",

I met the owner, very graceful and hospitable man, may God bless him and his family always!!!  He deserves 100 stars and I'm not just saying that out of no-where!!!   The service he provided was absolutely wonderful!  The food tasted great!!  I had ordered the full Cornish hen with rice and had substituted another side for hummus.  The portions were huge!!! I had also ordered some food to take with me on the next morning flight for my husband (chicken kabobs and other items) and the owner packed everything for me in very good packaging (for the flight).  My husband really enjoyed the meal the next night.  The food was great, the place was super clean (even the bathrooms), the prices were very reasonable (or even cheap compared to Bay Area) and the portions were huge.  On top of that, the service was very welcoming and hospitable.  What else can you ask for in a restaurant!!!   I wish we had such great tasting Arabic restaurants in the Bay Area.  If I ever get a chance to go back to Charlotte, I will definitely ask him the recipe for the most flavorful yellow rice I've tried in the whole world.  Thank you for providing such great food and great service to a hungry customer at close to 10pm at night.  God bless you!!!",

    "text": "Yelp reviews led us here while visiting Charlotte, and did not mislead.  We had a great buffet meal ... served on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from appx. 12:30 - 8:30. The owner was fabulous - lively and full of personality: staff was gracious and attentive.  Lots of meat and vegetarian options on the delicious buffet!  We weren't fans of the beef kofta, and do wish there'd been a dessert offering included.  My husband's favorite things were the lamb chops, and the baba ganoush (which had a distinct smoky flavor). I loved the flavorful tabbouleh, and there was a  grilled eggplant \"salad\" (not a hot dish) that I couldn't get enough of - delicious!  We got warm handshakes from the owner on the way out, and 2 repeat customers commented to us that this is the most authentic place in town.  We're already planning a return trip to Charlotte that will definitely include a visit to this hidden gem!",

The food that we ordered was generally good. There could be better communication when ordering food, however the food was freshly prepared and arrived fast. The wraps with fries receive an A-, as in pretty darn good.  The mixed grill was plentiful with a good amount of rice and meat selections.  However, I would have liked the meat to be less dry.   Customer service was generally good, very friendly people behind the counter.",

I decided not to do the buffet but to order off the menu. I got the NYC style Sharma plate. I got my nibblings a cheeseburger to share and my friend order the Cornish Hen plate. The whole ordering process was quite an ordeal and I was ready to go. I never felt like I knew exactly what was happening. I ordered at the counter then when I said it was for here I was directed to have a seat and told I could pay afterwards. No one helped us with drinks or silverware. It was kinda a free for all.     Once we got our food there were some slight issues. One my rice was cold and hard and needed massive amounts of the white sauce to make it edible. I requested some extra sauce and then I needed more but was told that it would cost 5.95 for more sauce. If you know me you know I hate paying for extra sauce when the entree is extremely dry. I would say that the dish overall was ok but it would have been better if it was fresh and hot. I hate to say this but I've had better off a food truck downtown.   The other issue was that they tried to exchange a half a hen for a Cornish hen. When it was brought to their attention there were excuses made and ultimately we had it taken back and removed from our check. But they decided that we would be still charged for the salad that came with the dinner. I was so ready to go and for the experience to be over that I just paid for the items and didn't make a stink.   I love Mediterranean food and this was not a good experience. I would like to say I would come back and give them another try but  I have found other restaurants that offer great food and service and so I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.

    "text": "Hands down, they have the best feel-at-home interiors. Everything is clean and tidy. The number of options you could dine at this restaurant are numerous. First, They have a take out section with an easy to order numbered menus and on your face big pictures. Second, they have an ala-carte dine in options with a quick menu card. Lastly, they have a buffet option.  Highly satisfied with the ala-carte we had here last time, we decided to take the adventurous route and go for the buffet. It was a friday evening and had a look around the buffet before taking it up. The items were half full and not having any kind of experience with this kind of buffet, we decided to take it up anyway. The items were not clearly described let alone tagged! Being choosy meat eaters, it was bizarre experience to taste these items and decide whether to eat them. Even though they were kept on the hot plate, none of the items were warm. Surprising thing was, no one took care of the buffet bar. It was totally unattended. Most of the food items were either cold or stale. We filled our stomachs with the fresh fruits and musk melons. Finally the baklava dessert plate was empty and we reminded the waiter to refill it. He said he would check but never came back with an answer. And forgot to mention he was the only waiter running around trying to take care of all the tables. So even if you dine in, don't expected to be taken care.  Having a bad experience, we didn't want to behave rude and paid the costly 15.99$ per person buffet anyway. We gave our feedback that the food items were cold and our request to refill the baklava plate was never addressed. The guy bluntly replied they were out of baklava even though they had plates and plates of freshly baked dessert items just behind the counter. We expected an apology or some sorry for your bad experience dialogue but the guy never said anything and was quick to swipe our card. Having seen our annoying faces, he quickly threw a dessert box at us. We left immediately - we should not have taken the dessert box, but having paid a costly buffet price for stale food, we took it anyway.  Of course, they serve great ala-carte food and take out meals. But why keep the buffet option if you decide to abandon it and let food go stale without any refills. And the restaurant desperately needs more staff if they really care about their dine-in patrons. It was also a sudden revelation that the restaurant was on the expensive side for an entry level take out place. 12-16$ entrees and 1$ water bottles - forgot to mention, you won't be provided any water, you got to buy them!  The only way I see you can enjoy their great food is to order a take out and forget that you will be seeing a pretty hefty bill for a take out.",

However, I will still come back just because the food is that good.   While we got a friendly welcome from the staff as soon as we entered, that was the extent of the customer service. After we found our own table no one ever came to check up on us. Little did I know I had to grab my own drink from one of the fridges at the front of the restaurant.   Being the weekend you can order directly from the menu or choose the buffet. I opted for the buffet so I could try a bit of everything. I am glad I did. I have no negative comments on any of the food. Everything was flavorful and tasty.  My favorites dishes were eggplant, lamb, and cauliflower. Nothing was labeled so I have no idea what anything was called.  I am hoping that we just caught the staff on an off day but either way the food alone is worth the visit.",

When we initially arrived, I was a tad skeptical; the restaurant was in a run down shopping mall, but since we had driven all the way there, we decided to give it a shot. We ended up going for the buffet, which was all-you-can-eat for $15. Every single item in the buffet was incredible. The tabouli was fresh, the hummus was full of flavor, and the bread was warm, straight out of the oven. The star of the entire meal, however, was the lamb. This dish alone would have been worth the $15, but considering it was part of a buffet, it is the bargain of the century. The meat quite literally fell off the bone, was incredibly moist, and absolutely packed with flavor. In addition, the owner knows us by name after only 3 visits, and is both very attentive and welcoming. La Shish Kabob has quickly become one of our favorites!!  Also if you get the chance, their COFFEE is out of this world. Thick, sludgey, and PACKS A PUNNNNCH.",

Everything was a musical melody on our taste buds.  LOL  The hummus was rich and just garlicky enough to not be overpowering!  We had the lentil soup as our other side and it was thick hearty and full of flavor.  My hubby added the spicey red sauce to kick his up a notch but I am not a fan of hot stuff so I passed.   The real star was the lamb shank meal.  While simple it was melt in your mouth good.  I am always amazed at how if you use the right spices and cook food properly it should be able to be consumed with no salt/pepper or additional seasonings and I would say this is True with La Shish Kabob.  The place itself is unassuming and easy to miss if you are not looking for it but the food and taste certainly make up for any lack of ambiance.    My hubby goes to the Halal store across the street when he prepares his curry goat at home.  :)  We finished it off with rice pudding and it was equally pleasing! Not too sweet but sweet enough with warm earthy spices that made me smile.    We are having fun discovering new eating spots and this will be in the rotation for sure.",

    "text": "Walking into this place takes you to another world far away where all your senses are awakened by the visual decor of Arabic writing, by the pungent smell of spices and the sounds of a different culture. The owner, he must be, was standing behind the cash register and was doing some fast talking in Arabic to a customer with his hands and arms all up in the air. Judging by the way the conversation was going, it looked like the owner wanted to comp the meal and then they hugged before the customer left with his food . I looked up at the pictures with numbers to help making ordering the food a little easier. There were displayed cases with raw marinated skewered meat so that you can see how fresh everything was. I ordered the veggie platter, some falafels, and lamb shanks. On some square tables located by the register were some cookies both sweet and savory that looked yummy so I bought some pastries with spinach filling. The whole time I was trying to order the owner was very helpful and friendly. He even gave me some almond and honey cookies that were delicious. I had everything to go and was so excited and couldn't wait to taste it. The veggie platter was delicious with some hummus, baba ghanoush, some salad, and falafels. These falafels were soft and I really preferred them crispy. The lamb shanks were a little gamy for my taste but pretty good if you like lamb. I would give this place another try but next time I'll try the chicken gyro. Did I mention the stuffed grape leaves? Those were the best ones I have had in a while!!",

    "text": "Let's be straight here. The place doesn't look like much. The mall it is in doesn't look great, and the logo looks like some elementary school kids - albeit talented ones - scribbled it on the brick. But if you give it a chance, you will find that it is worth a stop.  On the inside, the service is second-to-none, and even on your first visit you are treated like family. Which is not to say the family that you don't want around (though if you act that way and they kick you out, it's your fault, so consider yourself warned). No, they are warmly welcoming and help you through the menu of options, which can certainly seem challenging if this is your first time.  When you get to the food, it's almost like an old diner, with an open kitchen and that's great but it also means there aren't a lot of tables - a better option may be to take the food to go - only then it would not be hot off the grill, so you can decide the best course of action for your own needs.  If you find a spot, sit down and dig into it right away so you get some of the goodness when it is fresh, and it's definitely a great spot to give a shot, elementary logo and all.",

    "text": "I am a picky Mediterranean/ Arab food diner, but I gotta say that some of their selections are just off the hook! i.e. their chicken and beef kabob skewers over the yellow rice, lentil soup, cucumber and tomato salad. And the price you pay for the portion you get is a steal!   Having that said, I like the yellow rice more than their orange (or what they call the \"special\" rice), and I think the yellow rice should actually be the special rice, but oh well, whatever floats their boat.   The dessert is okay, but I don't really come here for dessert. Their food is just soooo filling for me, and it just makes my day.  ***A tip for everyone: I have noticed that if you take out and taking a long drive home, the food won't taste as great (but still decently good) as it originally was piping hot because some selections of the food may dry up. But this is not the owner's or the restaurant's fault, it's just common sense for some foods when you take out.   The ambiance/ aesthetics of this place are not great, but it's a small fast food place almost, and I really just go there for a delicious and filling meal.   Staff is friendly but not overly. The guy who owns the place has long red hair and does look like he is straight out of the Hobbit, but the only thing is he is not too friendly when there is a rush.",

I'm tempted to go there for lunch a second day in a row...it was that tasty!  If you're looking for a casual place with authentic food, you'll want to check out  La Shish Kabob! It has a little bit of Middle Eastern decor inside, but you don't go for the ambiance...you go for the delicious cuisine!   To start, we got the veggie combo: hummus, baba ganoush, and grape leaves. It comes with fresh sliced pita bread. Really after eating that plate, we were practically full. Next came our sandwiches: falafel and a chicken shawarma. The falafel was perfect! Crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside and seasoned to perfection. Halfway through the sandwich I knew I was stuffed, but my mouth didn't want to stop eating because of the flavor. For dessert we shared one baklava. It was pretty good. I prefer it made with pistachios, but this type was made with walnuts or pecans.  There are approximately 5 tables, but if you don't want to stay, plenty of people were ordering \"to go.\" This place was steady during lunch. One of the best things about this place, besides the quality of the food, is the price...we left under $20 including tip!   We will definitely return...probably as early as today...see you there!",

Made the trek south for a day in the QC, specifically b/c I was needing some ethnic food to satisfy an itch. Based on all the great reviews, THIS was my go-to, must try spot.   Hubs and I took the ankle biters and enjoyed the following:  Appetizer Sampler, $6.99, choice of three apps. We selected the hummus, fallafel and dolmas Kgrape leaves.) All were very good. The fresh pita is the best I've had since Idunnowhen.   Various imported drinks, all well priced and really good.  Lamb Shank special, $9.99, with choice of side and soup/salad. Where the heck can you get lamb shank for under $10bucks????????? Hubs enjoyed this, as did the one year old ankle biter. Salad is light and fresh, served w/a light, lemon-y house made dressing.  Chicken Kabob entree, $7.99, w/choice of side and soup/salad. Looked, smelled and tasted like the food that fed my belly and soul as a kid growing up surrounded by Greeks, Turks and Armenians. Delicious.   Izzat, the owner, was very friendly, quick to reccomend and clearly has a lot of experience in the industry. The set-up is simple and a bit shabby, but you are there to feast and that you do. You are served on platters (PLATTERS!!!!) and will most definitely have more than enough to take home. The four of us devoured our food. They musta thought we hadn't eaten for days. Thank gawd many eastern cultures use their bread (pita) as a utensil - I didn't look like a *total* barbarian.   So why not four stars? One major point: the owner smoked while standing at the counter, next to our table....in the restaurant....which is illegal...and I was with two asthmatics....and I loathe cigarette smoke. My other nitpick: my food was delicious but the rice was barely warm. That said, we had enough really good food to easily feed six people (though with just four we can delight in leftovers) for $32 smackers! NICE!",

I have to warn you - La Shish Kebob is not in the nicest strip mall and the restaurant itself is extremely small.  But please, don't let their location or interior deter you from giving them a try.   We were enthusiastically greeted by the owner and led to our table.  We ordered the 8-piece falafel platter as our appetizer.  For dinner, I ordered the vegetarian combo (with hommos, baba ghannouj and yalanji), and my hubby ordered the mixed grill kabob (with lamb, chicken, and beef).  I also ordered the special rice for $1 on the side.  Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious.  My only complaint was with how they delivered our food.  Since my vegetarian plate did not need to be cooked, it was delivered first and placed in the center of the table.  I thought - what, this is my dinner, right?  So, my hubby and I ended up sharing it while we waited for the falafel and his kabobs to arrive. The falafel plate was huge, outstanding in flavor, and lighter in texture than we are accustomed to (in a good way). We also shared my hubby's meat plate when it arrived, and it ended up being my favorite - the meat was really tender and juicy.  Frankly, I have never had chicken or lamb this delicious before.    The owner stopped by several times to see how we were doing, and even gave my hubby a special hot sauce that he just loved.  We could tell he took great pride in his place.  I'm only dropping a star because on subsequent visits, they were busier, and so the service suffered.  It's also a tiny place inside, and hard to enjoy your meal when it's really busy.",

I got the chicken shawarma platter and my husband got the mixed grill platter (lamp, beef, chicken).

    "text": "It's open until midnight.  That alone makes me happy, but there is a lot to this little place other than keeping convenient hours. Maybe I'm hungry at 11 cause I didn't get a chance to eat earlier & don't feel like a high fructose corn patty from MickeyD's or some other fried abortion swimming in grease. Too harsh, I love bar food and late night Chinese, but sometimes I need something else that's open late besides, fast food or a Denny's. Something I won't completely regret eating.  Too much ranting about the inconsequential...again.  La Shish is a hole in the wall Mom & Pop establishment. There's no pretension, no linens, no giggling strumpets on dates with tall doofuses, just solid Middle Eastern food at reasonable prices. The simplest things are always the best. They serve up well seasoned grilled lamb, chicken and beef kabobs. Their fries are a meh minus, but I feel like an infidel getting them here anyway. Then there's my favorite refrain for any restaurant: the food is not oily or greasy.  As far as I know (which is not much), this could be the best shawarma and definitely the best tahini sauce in Charlotte. The \"shawarma wrap\" is not unlike the donner kebabs that are ubiquitous in many European countries that serve as their version of fast food, late night drunk munchie snack and hangover placebo. Fucking delicious. And definitely better tasting than fast food with REAL meat and REAL vegetables. I mean, they even cut the meat off of that big thing, you know, that big thing.  Fairly vegetarian friendly; I like a good falafel every now and again & they have one.  \"Okay my friend\" is what the owner behind the counter always says when your food is ready. This is a quickie joint, not a Michelin star place, so expect the service to be \"authentic\" as well.",

My family and I eat here regularly and he's always quick to greet us with a grin and a handshake.  It's a real family business, his daughters also work there. The food comes in generous portions at great prices.  I am pretty much addicted to their chicken shwarma dinner with veggie rice, but the falafel is amazing too.  The first time I ate there I told the owner I would definitely be back... he looked at me and said \"Praise Allah for you my friend!\"  Praise Allah indeed and go eat at La Shish Kebab!",

Me and a buddy AJ and his family went here couple years ago now ...damn good food omg it's really amazing.. Yes there is other places in town but after revisiting this place again it's just better I think. You have to check out the Kibbeh, Falafel, Chicken Shawarma, Kafta Kabobs....!!  They also have a few desserts but my favorite is Baklava. If your a coffee person try the real deal Turkish coffee .....You won't regret it you'll thank me later ...enjoy!!!!",

I get the falafel wrap once or sometimes twice a week, and ask them to add their homemade green hot \"sauce\" which is made with jalapenos, lemon juice and garlic. Delicious!  It's also great mixed into hummus.  Also, I don't know what kind of incredible Lebanese pickles they put in the falafel wrap but I'd buy a whole container of them if I could!  I took a variety of treats to a recent NASCAR race for tailgating and my friends were blown away by how delicious everything is.  I really can't say enough wonderful things about La Shish Kabob.  Unlike so many Mediterranean places, everything is FRESH and homemade, and that makes all the difference in the world!!!",

    "text": "The food here is spectacular and an amazing bargain. The portions are so huge I ended up packing over half of it up to take home. The restaurant is small, clean and by no means fancy with friendly people there to help you (the best kind of place for me). The proprietor was very helpful when we asked questions and when he took the lid off his braised lamb shanks I'm fairly certain my eyes rolled back into my head. I posted a picture of the refrigerator case where the kabobs and salads are, which you can see is all very fresh and ready to go. I only wish I'd taken a picture of the rotisserie, but once the food came out I had a one-track mind.   The baba ghannouj is absolutely amazing. The eggplant is cooked on the grill so you get far more smoky flavor than you ordinarily get in it. Admittedly we didn't leave a whole lot of it to bring home since it came to the table with hot flat bread and we pounced on it like a pack of hungry wolves, so I had to get another order to go. You know... for medicinal purposes.. :)  The lamb kabob was very tender, even though it was slightly overcooked for my taste (which actually says quite a lot since lamb is usually not tender if overcooked). The spiced rice was very delicious and probably way too much of it but I won't complain since that means more delicious leftovers. In general their 'side dishes' are not side portions - if you have soup you get a whole bowl, not a cup, and the rice seems almost bottomless. And as long as we're on the subject of their soup, the lentil soup is absolutely delicious - perfectly seasoned and while we had it on a warm June day I could definitely see a bowl of this stuff setting the world back to right on a cold winter day. The side salad was very crisp and fresh with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber laced with parsley and mint. It arrives undressed and you drizzle it with the lemon juice at the table, it hits a whole lot of right spots on a hot day.  ***** 3/26/2014 ***** Move forward and after MANY visits this wonderful find still rates a solid 5 stars and then some!   I've been back several times and had various items on the menu. Every one of them amazing. And remember my comment on my lamb being slightly overdone? Ya, forget that... the owner remembers me from the first time I brought this up, and ALWAYS remembers exactly how I like my lamb cooked. That personal touch is what pushes this place WAY over 5 stars for me. Plus have you seen the sanitation rating???? How many perfect scores do you see these days.. but it doesn't surprise me. This restaurant is meticulously clean. Not just up front either - if you peek back into the kitchens you can see they are also very clean and well organized.",

    "text": "Four stars +  A year and over three dozen meals later I'm raising its rating. No, not everything is perfect, that doesn't happen anywhere but the food consistently more flavorful than it has right to be for a falafel joint - I suspect the owner is a foodie himself.   Usually with Arabic food I'm not drawn to meat dishes primarily, La Shish being the exception. I really like the Adana kabob, the mixed grill with special rice is a meat eater delight, even the chicken shwarma made me go like Larry David : \"don't know what the Palestinian did with the chicken but it's out of this world!\" Well, no it's not but it's really really good.   I recommend sharing a Foul Madamas appetizer, the taste always bring a smile to my face. I usually take home a container of their humus, priced like supermarket crap but so much better.  One thing: made without preservatives so you really want to eat within a few days.    The local Muslim community fully supports the restaurant  and it does a brisk business (Friday after prayer is a zoo in there!) but in spite of the many positive reviews I rarely if ever saw fellow gringos or gringas eating there.   We've never felt anything less than 110% safe eating there ourselves, but I did hear otherwise from locals so I'll end with this caveat: For adventure tourists only !   Not recommended for the tour bus or all inclusive cruise crowd.  8^P",

The owner is very helpful if you ask for suggestions or if you want something made special.    I knew that I had to try the falafel since I had read on other reviews that their falafel is really good.  So, I ordered a falafel wrap and a bowl of lentil soup.   Both were very solid, but not better than what I can get at the Kabob Grill in Stonecrest.  However, the pricing at La Shish Kabob is much cheaper.   So, if you are looking for good solid food at great prices, I would definitley recommend La Shish Kabob",

My dad had recommended the lamb shank, which I ordered, and my husband decided on the chicken kabobs.  I would have given this place a 5 star review for my lamb shank.  It was fork tender and packed full of flavor.  My son and I devoured it, yes my 4 yr old son loves lamb :)  My husband's dish, on the other hand, was missing the vegetables and the chicken was bland.  No strong flavor or marinade.  It was a disappointment.  We should have asked about the vegetables but being new to the place, we decided against it.  Also, the falafel was delicious too.  I will definitely go back but not sure if I can convince my husband to.  All in all, have the lamb!",

Although we'd never had it, Tony Stark's obsession and the ensuing post-credits scene were enough to spark our own shawarma craze. We were driving past La Shish Kabob one day and I noticed the neon sign indicating our quest could find its resolution there. I remembered reading many glowing reviews of the place here on Yelp. Within a day or so we had found our shawarma salvation, and it's less than a five-minute drive from home.  This unassuming hole in the wall is cramped and chaotic, but it is home to some of the best Middle Eastern food in town. Don't let the lack of fancy atmosphere steer you away from what could be your new favorite joint.  We now eat here or get takeaway at least two or three times a month. Yes, the shawarma is outstanding. Their falafel is the best I've ever had and the hummus is high up there, too. As a lifelong dolmas aficionado, I have to say theirs are the best I've had since I was a kid and visited an Egyptian family that my dad knew. My husband and I love to get the appetizer plate, always with hummus and dolmas. Everything we've tried has been incredible.",

Long have I been starved and roaming the streets of Charlotte for a middle eastern and/or Mediterranean eatery like La Shish Kabob.  Between the fact that it's not in the best part of town and that Sharon Amity is a construction zone at the moment may dissuade you from checking it out, but you will thank me if you do. It's nothing fancy to look at from the outside or inside, but there  are a few tables both in both areas. Otherwise it's basically like a really small deli type shop with a register and a display case and open kitchen area. While they have a full menu of middle eastern and Mediterranean delicacies, I have only had the Schwarma meal on both of my visits. The wife has tried the falafel and veggie plate I believe. The garlic sauce that comes with the Schwarma is amazing and the spices in the chicken are spot on. I really need to force myself to try something else. We sat down inside on our second visit and the smells from the plates on the other tables making me hungry all over again.  Many return visits to come and eventually, I will make it through the whole menu.",

    "text": "Three of us were in East Charlotte and decided to try this place out. I had the gyro with fries and my two friends had the chicken shawarma with fries and the grilled beef kabob with lentil soup and rice.   The grilled beef kabob was the tastiest. Probably about 12 small pieces of beef on a plateful of rice. He said the creamy lentil soup was delicious.   My gyro left a lot to be desired. If you're used to gyros with tzatziki sauce, prepare for disappointment. The pita was fairly large, but there wasn't much meat on it. The menu says it comes with tahini sauce, but it was more like a watery mayo without any of the flavor of tahini. It also had pickles which are different on a gyro, but I like pickles, so that was fine. The french fries were the same as frozen fries from a grocery store.  The chicken shawarma included two wraps and regular fries. It was pretty dry according to my friend.   Since all of us are water drinkers, we asked for glasses of water. Impossible to have here. You have to have the bottled water. The menu says it's spring water, but it's cheap purified water.   Service to the table was efficient, but no one checked on us at any time. The owner was friendly as others have mentioned when we went up to order and pay the bill.  Our bill came to $32 and change.",

The place is small but, even late at night, there was pretty good business.  The owner looked straight out of The Hobbit trilogies and wasn't super warm and fuzzy.    I think this place was too hyped up in my head after reading the glowing reviews. We had taken our food back to the hotel and unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype.  I don't think anyone finished their meal.  I love me some spices but the entire meal was entirely too overly spiced.  It might have been due to the meat tasting a bit off...so maybe the heavy hand in spices was to offset that taste/fact?  I was especially excited about kibbeh being on the menu but instantly disappointed when I popped in the first bite.  Too bad I ordered a bunch of everyone.  We are huge fans of kafta but we could barely finish ours.  The kids even quit early and they loooooiiove kafta/kufta/kubideh.  Overall, the portions were decent and the food ok if I hadn't had anything to compare it to.  Maybe this was just an off night since I'm sure the reviews are glowing for a reason.",

Lamb shanks were falling off the bone and cooked PERFECTLY. The marbling was to die for and the meat was so juicy. The lamb kabob is cooked differently but equally as awesome. Finally we ended with desert- baklava, the owner said he had just made it that morning. I almost broke up with my boyfriend over the last piece- flaky, light, cream filled center, and not too sweet which is so rare to find in a desert! It was phenomenal!

Walking in, it seemed as if it was a small shop, a grocery store even. Instead they had tables and a kitchen with pictures of food and the tv channel set on a foreign news channel.   The first thought came to me as: 'Hm. This should be an interesting experience.' As the manager, or owner, came out he was very nice. He showed us the specials for the day as well as gave us menus. And the menu items, well lets just say it was pretty cheap. When the food came out (I bought a rotisserie chicken) the portions were plentiful. The rice wasn't the usual rice I usually eat, but it was mixed with spices and a little dry (that's the way the rice is supposed to be cooked) and it tasted awesome.  We also ordered the lintel soup, which was also good. At the price, no wonder why people love this place. There wasn't a ton of options on the menu, but as people say \"quality, not quantity\" this place really defines it. However the quantity of the food that comes out on the main dish is plentiful.  However, there are some things to keep in mind when you come here to eat. They don't have 'free' water when you eat there. It isn't a bad thing, but when the prices are that low, it's understandable. And also, this place is definitely a take-out restaurant. Call in, take an order (or go there and make an order) and enjoy at work or wherever the day takes you.   Overall though, I couldn't decide to give it a 4 or 5. I want to give it a 5, but I think I'll have to come here several more times to get me to scaled to that level. Next time I come though, I'll definitely bring my own water!",

However- the hamburger could be greatly improved. the only thing that got attention on this hamburger is the meat- assumably thawed and microwaved? There was no char on my meat. Other than that, everything else was just plopped on- some lettuce, pickles, tomato, and a cold bun. The saving grace was the ketchup and white sauce that was already squirted on my burger.  I think they could make the hamburger better by caramelizing the onions and toasting up the bun.  Otherwise, they just want you to be happy that you at least get a halal hamburger and be satisfied with that. I wont be coming back for this hamburger. But i will be back for their authentic dishes.",

    "text": "Not sure how this place is getting the reviews it does. We lived in Los Angeles for seven years and ate all kinds of Middle Eastern food all over the city. This place is terrible. We got a few apps- the falafel and the kibbeh were the only things decent (oh and the cuc, tomato stuff they gave you when you sat down). The Baba had no flavor, the kibbeh had a weird, not good, taste and the meat pies were disgusting. We also got the chicken schwarma wrap. The chicken was old and hard- the worst pieces of meat were put in it. When the guy asked us if we wanted to take home the almost whole wrap we were leaving behind, and we said no, he didn't ask why. The kafta (kofta) was eh. Not very flavorful and it was flat. It's supposed to be log or cigar shaped- helps it be juicier, not to mention it's more meat. And the atmosphere/facilities are as bad as many ppl said but it also felt dirty. And I won't even say how scary it was to see the cook place vegetables on the grill right next to the raw meat. It might have helped if the veggies came out hot and cooked but they were cold with practically no sear. Nasty.",

You wouldn't know by the looks of the restaurant, but this place serves some of the best Mediterranean food you can find this side of the Atlantic! Not only is the food amazing, but the prices are super reasonable and really let you feel like you can try a bunch of new food without spending a ton of money! The lentil soup is some of the best soup I've ever had, though it is a bit on the spicy side! I also highly recommend the Lamb Philly Cheesesteak as a new spin on an American classic. Do yourself a favor and try this place out!",

I have never eaten a chicken shawarma before, but I'm pretty sure it was the tastiest meal I've ever had. The rotisserie chicken inside was flawless ! it comes in a wrap that looks like a soft-shell tortilla but the taste and texture of it are much better. I also tried falafel for the first time and it was great as well. It reminded me of the tasty fried chick-pea stuff you find at Indian buffets, but falafel blows the similar Indian dish out of the water ! I washed it all down with a Lebanese kiwi-flavored soft-drink that was so good I considered buying about 5 of them when I left to keep around the apartment. How other people rated this place less than 5 stars baffles me, I'd give it 6 stars if I could ! I'm definitely coming back in the near future.",

    "text": "Calling all Muslims and Jews!  Peace in the Middle East (or Middle Earth, as Bruno calls it) is possible through food.  We saw all types of people eating here when we had dinner.  The owner and chef looks like that dude from Survivor a few years ago, with the tie-dye shirt and curly hair.  And wow, does he make a mean kabob.  Their signature dish appears to be the kabob platter with three kabobs and kafta.  The kafta was served over a bed of delicious brown rice and with a grilled tomato that oozed with flavor.  Heavens to Betsy, it was good.  The apple of my eye (the wife) had the lamb special and she said its authenticity almost did her in.  The lamb was tender with a yoghurt sauce and nuts.  Lots of great food and very reasonably priced.  If you go, pick up a CD of Arabic Groove, roll down the windows of the car and blast it as you approach this small gem of a restaurant on the east side (yes, the east side, say it proud, say it loud) of Charlotte.",

    "text": "Absolutely marvelous!!!  My husband & I had passed by several times and said we needed to try it as our favorite Middle Eastern restaurant closed several months ago.  As mentioned in other reviews, it is a very small restaurant and the ambience is non-existent but this is not even noticeable because of the friendliness of the people and the quality of the food.  We got the appetizer combo and chose houmos, falafel and stuffed grape leaves.  We also got the kabob combo which came with two sides; we chose a wonderful salad and fries - the fries were average but with the amount of food, it didn't matter.  We also sampled the rice which is another choice of sides - not special but good.  The food is very, very reasonable and we will defintely be back.  We decided that besides the houmos (the best I've ever had), our favorites were the falafel and the chicken kabob.  This place is hidden in a nondescript strip mall. I hope it survives.",
