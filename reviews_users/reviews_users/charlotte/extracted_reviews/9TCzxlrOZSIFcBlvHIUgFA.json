Quite simply, PePeRo serves up the most authentic Korean food in/near Charlotte.   It doesn't quite compare to the Korean places in Chicago, LA and even Denver, but it will take care of the cravings. Has any else notice that there is a serious lack of Korean restaurants in the QC... But that's besides the point. They have a pretty extensive menu, offering a wide variety of dishes. I didn't expect a place that small to offer some of the dishes they did. Service is nice and attentive and prices are fair. I'm a fan!",

I ordered the Bibimbap and cleaned every speck of the bowl, the miso soup, and ALL the sides. Mind you, I'm a little 5 feet Asian girl.

Luckily, Yelp did not steer me wrong!   Stopped in for a quiet lunch- the place looked simple and clean. Our waitress was attentive, very friendly. Ordered a seafood pancake that was thicker than I have been used to in other restaurants, but still perfectly golden and tasty. The sauce that came with it was salty/spicy and proved a good combination. My husband got a dolsot bi bim bop (I cant spell!!) and I had some clear noodles with beef and veggies. Everything hit the spot perfectly! I had leftovers and am still excited about it.  The little market portion is cute and has all the usual items- aloe vera juice, sweets and chips, etc that you can't get anywhere else.   I will definitely be back! I really enjoyed it and maybe after I come back a few times I can kick it up to a full star rating.",

It met our needs, but it was not as good as we would want it to be.   Venue: interesting, but strange..  We walked into a grocery store, thinking, where is the restaurant? Only, it was to the right of the establishment and was small.  Luckily, we found a table early (morning), and it was not busy yet.  Food: The place serves the meat already cooked and sizzles in front of you (save you from cooking your own and coming out smelling like a walking Korean BBQ). But he Bulgogi was not as juicy as we had hoped.  The japchae was actually delicious, and we gobbled that one up quickly. The best that had was their Korean tea. I have to give them credit, they got us addicted to their tea that we walked to the store and asked the cashier for the same type of tea the restaurant served us, and bought a box (corn tea - in a yellow box)  Service:  Although there was a bell you could ring, our waitress kept going to the other table instead of us. We were missed twice in a tiny restaurant!  So it did irked us.  Conclusion: Good, but will only come back for japchae and their tea. My husband and I will definitely come back to grocery store :D",

    "text": "Before today, my experience with Pepero was amazing.  Customer Service was amazing, environment was great, food was awesome, but today's experience turned everything upside down.  So, the first of the problems I had today was there was a new implemented policy that side dishes were limited to 2 servings per table.  First of all, the new implemented policy was not documented in their menu.  Secondly, when I asked the waitress... she was very rude and impatient.  When asked about the new \"policy\", her answer was rude making it seem like it was our fault.  Stating that due to rising cost and increase popularity of the restaurant, they no longer service additional sides.  Her excuses were rude, obnoxious, and condescending.  Also, she failed to bring us our drinks... for the rest of the meal, my friend's drinks were dry.  Never came back to refill them.  Next, there were flies flying around our table and everywhere else.  I instructed my friend to hit the button... the waitress arrived and we explained it to her, and she just stood there stating that it's because of the \"change of weather\".  Now, I understand about change of weather, but if there's an issue fix it.  She failed to fix it, she just walks away while our food is infested with flies.  After this, I lose my appetite because the customer service was poor, waitress was poor, food quality was now poor due to fly infestation.  I call the waitress to remove the food (please note that I literally had 3 or 4 bites of my meal) and then they had the audacity to ask for me to pay for my food.  This was rather absurd in my books.  So, while this was going on... the employees and their families (yes, a woman had her infant child in the kitchen) were trash talking in Korean.  Little did they know, my friend was Korean, so she understood everything that was said.  In the end, she decides to again ask for her money and I decide to only pay half of it as a generosity... but when I get home, I found out the sides she's given me were completely rotten, low quality and probably from the trash can.  So, if you would like a place that is completely backwards run and disgusting then please go to Pepero.  Otherwise, there are other Korean restaurants within a 10 minute radius.",

We ordered two dishes,  one pork and one beef that someone in the parking lot had suggested to us on our way in and he raved about the food and he was half Korean.  I didn't find it to be any different tasting than what I can cook Asian style. They serve little tastes of vegetables that weren't appetizing or tasty at all. Overall, very disappointing. I'll try Korean again, just not this place. My nail girl in New York makes better food than this. I found nothing appetizing or flavorful here.",

Who would've thought there would be a small restaurant inside a small Korean grocery store. There is nothing fancy about this place but it really does not matter because the food is 100% authentic Korean food..and absolutely delicious.   I just love the laid back atmosphere..siping green tea and watching Korean tv shows. The side dishes are delicious and is traditionally served with your food. I love the Kimchee!! I usually order the Bibimbap in a hot stone bowl..but this time around I decided to try the beef fried rice which was toped with a fried egg. It was super delicious and filling.  This establishment is family owned and run..the best part is after your tasty meal you can explore the grocery section and pick up some items to bring home. I highly recommend finishing your meal off with Ice-cream shaped fish..   I absolutely love this little gem and will be definitely coming back each time I need my Korean food fix. Don't be surprised by what the building looks like and where the restaurant is..the food alone makes you forget where you are.",

I've been there a few times in the past and the food was alright, nothing amazing nor horrible either. We were seated quickly, there was 3 tables occupied. There were two servers, the guy took the table to our left, the girl took the front table and ours. Maybe 15 minutes later, the table to our left got their food first. 2 big group of people came in during that time and got seated quickly and got their orders in too. About another 30 minutes went by, one of the big group got their food. Another 10 minutes after that, the second big group got theirs. By that time, one hour has past and neither the front table or us have got our food BUT the two big group who came 15 minutes after us got theirs.   I understand the 2 big groups may bring in more money but that is not how you treat your customers! I heard the front tables order and they didn't order a lot of food, neither did we. I was patient enough to wait one hour and my food was still not on the way so we left. I will NOT be coming back and will NOT recommend this place to anyone because service is TERRIBLE!!!",

When the bill came, he had charged me for the appetizer.  When I reminded him what happened he said \"Well, the bug wasn't on there when I brought it to the table\".  I didn't even know what to say, I just looked at him in disbelief.  He then said he would go ask and returned saying I wouldn't be charged.  I did pay for my meal.

If you've come a-knockin' looking for the newest trends of truffles atop your kimchi pancake, you can't appreciate the slight doughiness they have here.  Looking for accomodations? Here's a plastic white fork that ostracizes you from the thicket of chopsticks.  At least this place's got ambiance, right...it really sets the mood, right?  Riiiiight.  Splashes of yookgehjahng soup up on my shirt is dead sexy.  Though-despite all its quirks, this place is endearing and serves up some pretty darn good Korean food.    Came here with some buddies who had never tried PePeRo BeFoRe... sorry, it gets addicting to type like that.  We just ordered a bunch of food off the menu and shared everything.  I thought everything tasted pretty good, but not spectacular.  It's like eating at your friend's house where the Korean food just isn't as good as it is at home.  Here, the daejeegohgi is pretty juicy and tender.  Mandu is okay.  Jjambbohng had plenty of seafood.  But when you put everything together - it hits the spot. PePeRo can definitely hold its own and I see many a craving satisfied with Korean food here. Now only if they served soju and had a karaoke machine...  dmo out.",

This place brings back memories of Koreatown- Manahttan, and Flushing in New York City. Hole in the wall places that you would drive by and miss, but once you walk in- your nose will take you to the back where the restaurant is located.   We were here for lunch and the place was packed. One waitress managed all the tables bring out water, food as well as cleaning up tables. Definitely, a mom and pop establishment and not like the commercial run Asian stores.  All you have to do is flag her down and there is a service button which really does works. Definitely, Authentic Korean Food being served here folks.  Pucker up and drink extra water for you'll need it after eating the Kimchi. LOL. Enjoy the little side dishes that comes with your entree. My favorite is the Seaweed, and Fish cake-taste like fish balls which are thinly sliced.  We ordered the buns (3)- Came out steaming hot and tasty. Barbequed, marinated short ribs and the Bim Bi Bop.  After this hearty lunch, we shopped at the store and bought tofu, seaweed, cookies, and tea bags.  Will be back for lunch again and more grocery shopping. Not a huge selection with fresh fruits or vegetables, but good frozen items like Miso, Potstickers and dried goods like Ramen Noodles, and sweet/snacks.",

But once you get a taste of the authenticity (from the grocery store to the small quirky korean waitress whos very outgoing with jokes) you will not be dissappointed. I got the dol sot (hot korean bowl) and the soontofu with a mackerel which was very flavorful and spicy. The mackerel was cooked well. The korean bowl was excellent and it came out on a hot bowl. It had a nice consistency with a little crunch. They also brought out small plates with different kimchi dishes to add to the meal. Im in love with this small gem.   If you ever wAnt authentic korean food come here! Its awesome with great customer service. You can ask as many questions as you want if you dont know ab korean food!

    "text": "I will definitely be back for more. In fact, after I ate at PePeRo that's all I've been thinking about. Literally. With the weather getting colder and my need to satisfy my crave for awesome marinated beef and spicy soups... I could think of no better place than PePeRo.  So when you immediately pull into the parking lot you're probably thinking... have I found the right place? Turns out PePeRo is located in the back of a Korean Grocery Store. This is definitely a hole in the wall but sometimes that's where you find the best food. On the side of your table you can press a button and it will ring for a waitress to assist you. The customer service is great there and the food came out relatively fast too. We ordered the bulgogi and a hot, spicy beef stew. As you can see from other reviewer photos they also provide a variety of side dishes for you try. All low calorie yummy goodness.    It's really hard to find a Korean  restaurant in Charlotte but I'm so glad PePeRo is here. Otherwise if I wanted Korean food I would have to drive all the way down to Columbia or drive up to Independence. If anyone else knows where more Korean restaurants are located please send me a message! Eat well my friends.",

You won't find much in the way of ambiance here, but if you're looking for some authentic delicious Korean food then you should definitely visit. Spend some time perusing the shelves of the grocery store after your meal!",

I went and the food was pretty good, but overly expensive, i wanted to shop in the grocery store afterwards, so i left a few dollars as a tip. she came back running to me, claiming how she didnt give us bad service, and basically talked me into giving her more money! I wouldnt have given a bad review at all if it wasn't for her coming after me. it was just a really uncomfortable situation.. after reading the yelp reviews and knowing im not the only one, brings me more questions about why she did it, do you guys not read your reviews? 2 stars were only for the food by the way. not the service or the pricing of this place.",

Def your definition of a hole in the wall, but the food was always amazing and the service was exceptional the last time I visited with my gf's! I'm not super adventurous on food, so I usually stick to what I know, we ordered the seafood pancake, bulgogi, seafood tofu soup, and the squid stir fried was amazing! And of course, my top reason why I eat Korean food..the side dishes...never disappoint! And they also have a small Korean grocery...technically, the restaurant is in the corner of the grocery store...so, after you're done inhaling your food, you could just step right out and wrap grocery for more Korean dinner for the week and of course one of their refreshing popsicles to close the deal!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: this was my first exposure to Korean food. If I could recommend some more expert reviews to read on this, i would say check out Dan C, Ellen O, Peggy C and Christi K's posts.   I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Dan C. took myself and some friends here on Monday night. We put him in charge of recommendations and ordering. We got a round of appetizers for our group of five and all different entrees. I don't know what anything is called... so bear with me. App wise kimchi pancake, steamed bun and the wonton-potsticker like goodness. I went with the bbq pork with steamed rice.   Bottom line: it was all good. The seafood noodle type soup was LOADED with seafood. And best part... it's all a ton of food. We all had leftovers for the next day. Split 5 ways we each spent only $16. What a deal.  Some things to know (for those not familiar with PePeRo or Korean cuisine)  -There's a bell at your table for service.  -Try all the sides that come out with your food.  -If you're coming from Charlotte on Monroe Rd, turn before the restaurant. I drove past it and turned into the driveway on the other side which is actually for another business.  -Go explore the grocery store.   -Both the store and the restaurant take credit cards. However, please note the grocery store does have a $20 minimum.  -They do have plastic forks for the chopstick-challenged. And by chopstick challenged, I am talking about myself. This is the girl who eats sushi with her hands.  -Don't be afraid to ask questions. Someone can point you in the right direction.  I will definitely be back. I loved the vibe here. It was comforting and kind of felt like getting a homecooked meal at a relative's house.",

    "text": "Inspired by Dan C's recent review and some Yelp fervor, I decided to spend Saturday in Matthews. PePeRo was my first stop. Yes, I know it's Korean but I had a couple of childhood flashbacks to NYC Chinatown when I entered. Really enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone and trying something different. The menu was very intimidating but someone saw fit to fill in the dish descriptions below the pictures/Korean dish names (mechanical pencil?). I quickly scrolled thru the Yelp Photos and played match that picture. Warning: I will not even try to phonetically spell the dish names.  The pan fried dumplings were some of the best I've eaten. The spicy pork with rice = addictive - slight sweetness with a little afterburn. The noodle soup with beef/egg = lots of flavor and enough food for 3 people. My favorite parts were the side dishes with pickles, bean sprouts, kelp, fish cake and those cool metal rice containers (your rice stays hot the whole meal- what a concept). Definitely four stars for flavors, quantity and price. One app, two meals and drinks = only $30. Want to try the kimchee or seafood soup next visit.",

The menu has some of the basic Korean food such as bulgogi, Jajangmyeon, kimchi jii gae and etc. they include complementary side dishes when you order.   The food was good and prices were decent. I wouldn't say it was the best Korean food I've ever had nor the worst. This place satisfies my cravings for Korean food when I can't drive down to ATL.   The grocery in the front was cute.

Most of their banchan tasted like it had been sitting around for a few days. Their galbi tasted ok, but all of the pieces were small and mostly fatty. Their yook gae jang, though not the most appetizing to look at, was decent and also the only reason I might try this place again if I need to satisfy my Korean food craving.",

They are small sides serve with the entree. They are different each time. Usually alway have kimchi it's a Korean version of spicy sauerkraut. Steamed scrambled eggs, potato with Asian mayonnaise, fish patty.   Korean BBQ: a must have Galbi is short ribs Bulgogi: is thinly sliced ribeye   Haemul Pajeon (Korean Seafood Pancake) is my favorite.  Japchea is a yam noodle stir fried with veggie and bulgogi beef. Yam noodle are semi clear noodles With a chewiness to it.  Can't go wrong with kimchi fried rice.   If you want a different tea, they serve barely tea. It has a slight smoky and sweat taste.",

The service was just fair and not remarkable, though the old waitress who served us seemed jumpy all the while and giggling around tables. After paying for our lunch, we wanted to see around the grocery store, and that waitress came to us in the grocery area with the pay slip, saying that it's less than 10% tip and she can't live with so little tip that she doesn't have any salary from the restaurant, asking for more, and left the bill for us to rewrite the tip. We didn't do anything but just put the bill back to the restaurant counter. A few minutes later, she came back again asking us to give more tips! I wonder why the store manager didn't do anything about her harassing customers like this since everyone in the store could see what she was doing to customers, unless she's actually part of the management and pretending not to be one. We could have asked our tip back for what she had done! We insisted politely that's all we could pay for the tip, and she finally left with a disappointed and slightly resentful look on her face. Thanks to her, we lost our interest completely in spending more of our hard-earned money in their grocery shop, nor do we want to go back there at all ever after.",

I'm not going to lie - it can be a bit intimidating, especially if you've never been. Let me lay it out for you - PePeRo is located in Matthews, near the intersection of John St/Monroe Rd and Hwy 51.  The entrance is located on the side of the building - there aren't a ton of parking spots but it's adequate.  When you enter, you'll be entering the market portion of PePeRo and off to the right of the entrance is the restaurant. The dining room is split into a couple different sections, I suspect from the effort to add on more dining tables. Usually, someone is there to greet you and show you to a table. It can get rather busy during peak dinner hours.  The menu is fairly straight forward - yaki mandoo, kimchi pancakes, bulgogi, etc - and it comes with the traditional banchan (side dishes).  My faves are the yaki mandoo and the kimchi pancakes.  The bulgogi portion is generous and comes with white rice. My husband usually gets the kimchi tofu soup. I've also had the cold buckwheat noodles which is yummy on a hot day!  I have to admit my favorite part about visiting PePeRo is the market - I can pick up a lot of my Asian favorites, not just Korean! I can pick up Japanese curry cubes, roasted seaweed packs, miso paste, Filipino sardines, sauces galore, as well as green tea, barley tea, and rice!     So my two cents? Don't be intimidated to visit, there's usually someone who can help you out and direct you to what you're looking for.",

Korean Ribs are a favorite Dish of mine!  Not only a Korean Favorite, a Favorite for all cuisines!  The Service here is GREAT, everyone is very friendly and helpful!  The guy helped me last time, had good recommendations, even recommended that I not get certain dishes!  The Ribs are my Favorite!  The Spicy Stir-Fried Squid is another favorite.  The Sauce is incredible, the Secret in the sauce is FIRE!  Real Fire put in the Pan!  That is what he told me and I believed I could taste it! !! !!!  That does not mean it is too Hot... While it is \"Spicy\" it will not be too hot for almost all of my friends (you know what I mean right?) and almost hot enough for POPROCK LOVE!  Speaking of Love!  This is a GREAT place to fall in LOVE and makes my \"Lookalota\"!  I have also enjoyed: BBQ Pork and another Beef dish!  I took a few photos you can check out if you like!  The Kimchi here is very good, a little spicier than most places (I have only been to four Korean Restaurants).  The other \"extras\" are very good too! The Fish Cakes are the only dish of the \"extras\" I do not care for in any Korean Restaurant.  When dinning in an Asian Restaurant I LOVE it and take it as a HUGE Compliment when the servers do NOT offer any utensils other than Chop sticks and a spoon for soup!  I imagine they may have forks though I have never seen any, most of the patrons I see here are white and I notice everyone has chop stick skills!  This is Two reviews in ONE - Part 2 is for the Market!  For the size that it is they have a nice variety of Candy and some other things I have gotten every brand and flavor of Mochi (help I did not spell Mochee right) they carry!",

Kids review: The dumplings (\"yaki mandoo\", fried pork dumplings) were good with the sauce. The rice is really sticky but good. We liked the meat (Korean bbq with rice) the most, it was the best.   Parents review: We got one order of dol sot bibimbap in the hot pot, it was a little light on meat but so delicious. Loved how the rice got a little bit crispy in the hot pot. The chili sauce was a perfect addition. We also got an order of the spicy pork - huge portion of delicious spicy meat. Not too spicy, just right. The pickle side dishes were delicious and beautifully presented.   The only downsides were that the decor is a little drab and there's no alcohol served here. Service was great, though. The kids enjoyed the service button on the table - just ring the bell when you need something and someone appears instantly. So cool!  When you're done eating, make sure to stop by the market for some treats - the kids love chocolate pokke sticks and strawberry ramune (Japanese soda).",

    "text": "There's not much authentic Korean food in Charlotte and especially not in North Carolina in general.  This stuff is pretty much as good as it gets. When I lived in Charlotte, PePeRo was still about a 40 minute drive from my house. Occasionally, I'd make a special trip just to eat here because it's so damn good.  I've only tried the BiBimBap, kim chi, fish cakes, and pickled vegetables. I always order the same thing because I love it so much.  The BiBimBap is cooked properly and I always splurge and spend an extra $1 for the hot stone bowl. It's worth the extra dollar because the rice gets super crispy and crunchy at the bottom and the dish stays hot during the entire meal.  Of course, the restaurant is easy to pass by. If I didn't have it on google maps I probably would have driven right past it without even noticing it.  You have to walk through the store to get to the restaurant itself. While I admit, this can be a bit intimidating, the food makes up for the lack of decor and odd placement of the dining area. It's one of those no frills places with really awesome food. Just don't go in expecting ornate decor because it's just not that kind of restaurant.  Staff is always attentive and they have a button at every booth you can press to alert your waitress. I've never felt the need to actually use it though.   As for the store, they have lots of yummy Asian treats. Usually after dinner, I'll buy a little aloe drink or an ice cream for dessert. Some people may feel that the presence of the store detracts from the dining experience, but I disagree. I think it adds to it. Who doesn't like to eat and then shop in the same place?",

My husband and I love Korean, but because Matthews is quite a drive from where we live, it took us some time to finally pay a visit to Pepero. We finally went for dinner yesterday.   The food was good - it's nothing fancy and certainly not the best Korean I've ever had, but it was reminiscent enough of Mom's home-cooked comfort Korean cuisine. I had the kimchi jjigae, which was pretty solid.   Pepero is most definitely NOT a restaurant you go to for the atmosphere. The entrance is on the side towards the building's rear, and it's surrounded by towers of boxes from food shipments. It pretty much just feels like you're eating in the middle of a small grocery store...which you technically are if you take away the wall dividing the restaurant from the store. In other words, no matter how much your crush loves Korean food, this is not the place for a first date, folks.   All in all, I would definitely go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it. Better start diving into some Korean cookbooks!",

    "text": "I ventured over with my future Korean mother-in-law for some authentic Korean groceries. I felt a bit awkward in there, being the only white person in an Asian store, but the store associates didn't stare too much. They were quiet and were super helpful when it came to carrying over a large sack of rice to our car -- an Asian staple!  I'm a big fan of Grand Asia Market, so this is like a mini-mart version with mostly Korean brands. The store layout is a little wonky -- the food isn't organized like a normal grocery store. Some of the foods are hard to figure out -- a small portion have English translations, but most I left up to my FMOL to transcribe for me. I lingered around the sweets since I am a sucker for sugar and I don't need English words to tell me what cookies or frozen mochi tastes like! Hehe! I was shocked to discover Korean \"pocky\" that's called \"Pepero\" -- not sure if it's a coincidence that the store has the same name... :) We also picked up the staple of all Korean diets: Kimchi! It's pickled cabbage that's fermented for a LOOONG time, but not something I would be able to incorporate into my daily meals (my boyfriend doesn't really like it -- shocking, I know).  Apparently, when you spend over a certain amount here, you get a package of mochi-like treats for free! They're cold, multi-colored, round, and rubbery with a sweet bean paste inside. FMOL popped them like candy, but I stuck to eating one since it's a creepy texture to chew.  I didn't notice that there's an actual restaurant in here until we were checking out! It's hidden behind a set of swinging doors (the kind you see in Westerns). Will definitely have to drop in for a bite next time! Gotta try me some Korean BBQ! ;)  *One safety concern of this store is that the Emergency Exit is completely blocked by boxes. Hopefully they can fix that soon.",

    "text": "We were really excited about the reviews, so we came to Pepero with great anticipation. We were seated right away at 8pm, as the restaurant was not busy. That was when the nightmare began. After taking our order, our waiter completely disappeared. As in, 38 minutes later, our banchan/appetizer dishes had not appeared, and they hadn't even checked on us. Meanwhile, at the table next to us, a couple sat down, and were served immediately. In fact, they got their entrees before we even got our banchan. Oh, and we ordered bulgogi. It wasn't as if we ordered something that they had to make specially.  So after 38 minutes, we pressed the call button and asked about the status of our banchan and our entrees. \"Oh, those don't come with your meal.\" Really? I mean, seriously? But ok, fine, what about our entrees? How are those doing? So he disappeared to check. By disappeared, I mean for a full 10 minutes, and at that point we just walked out of there.  There were 2 waitstaff, and only 4 couples in the restaurant. Also, I don't understand why they did not bring banchan, and why after a total of 48 minutes in the restaurant, all we got was water and bad attitude from the waiter. I was not confrontational, I was not jamming the call button, and maybe that's why I was not served at all. Should I have tried to talk to the manager, or raised my voice? I don't think so, because that would make me as rude as they were!",

Why are there so few Korean restaurants in Charlotte? And why are they all in Matthews? Sure I've tried Chowan Gardens, and they're ok, but what I call Asian for white people.  So I've ventured into PePeRo, and am much happier person now. They must have had a recent renovation, because the infamous counter with the sideways menu is gone. Or maybe I just couldn't find it.  There is now a nice looking dining area, with about 12-14 tables. Also a television or two, and table side service, which was more than adequate. I would have preferred an actual glass of water, as opposed to the coffee mug with minuscule amount of ice.    The food was just fabulous. The banchan is my favorite part of the Korean meal, and these did not disappoint. The garlicky cabbage and daikon kimchi, bean sprout salad, fish cakes, and radish salad were all delicious. Would have loved to had another variety in the lineup, but ask and they will replenish whatever banchan you would like. The short rib soup and bibimbap were yummy, and prices were very reasonable.  5 stars for Charlotte, maybe 4 stars for LA; but I can't afford to fly out to LA for my Korean fix all the time. This is all Charlotte has and I'm grateful for it.",

Plus grandpa was asleep and snoring behind the cash register. Sweet dreams old man. Lots of good stuff in the not-so-mini-mart as well.   Great food and cheap, awkward dining place.

I thought, \"No way could this dirty looking door with all the trash sitting outside be the entrance\" - but it was. We were expecting a hole in the wall, but still surprised by the entrance. Hitting the bell on the table to order was interesting, but it works. We both ordered hot bibimbop (hard to tell what anything else on the menu was for me). We were served the banchan - all good. I've had Korean sushi before and it has a totally different flair than Japanese so I asked for that. They pulled it from the grocery so we ate it from a styrofoam plate. It wasn't bad, but quite far from the deliciousness at the Blue Cactus in Columbia, SC for example. The bibimbop was great but a bit smaller portion than what we're used to. Husband has been to Korea several times and it's his favorite dish. Hubby says the gochujang sauce tasted like what he expected, so I guess it's just not my thing. It wasn't as inexpensive as we were expecting for the hole in a wall vibe and smaller portions. Still, it was good and we'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "This place is a gem! I was kind of taken back my the small unassuming exterior but went inside anyway (the entrance is to the side next to the parking!). There were two parts to this place: a restaurant on the right and a Korean/Asian store on the left. At the restaurant, I ordered the jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and it was great, a very filling portion size. The server was very friendly (and could speak Japanese, a major plus for me and my Japanese family lol) and made sure that everything was going good. When you order the food, they also give you a variety of small side dishes (which I believe is common in Korea and in Korean restaurants). Our side dishes were cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, daikon kimchi (I think), a seaweed salad-type dish, spicy fish cakes, and pickled radish. Very tasty!  In the store section, there was a variety of asian food such as fish, kimchi, and a variety of instant noodles. They also had fresh made tteok (rice cakes) as well as ice cream sold both in packs of 5-6 or individually. Some of the items in the store didn't have clear price tags, but I think that most items were sold at a reasonable price.  Overall, a very great store/restaurant! Would definitely recommend.",

We drive 30 minutes for our Korean Food fix and never leave disappointed and always stuffed!  Love the rice cakes and the spicy pork with vegetable these are our go to dishes. The soup dishes are great as well you just need to experiment here as the menu is sensory overload.  Love the Banchan (side dishes) of pickled veggies that accompany each meal. When you done walk over to the store and load up on essential spices and noodles from the grocery store.",

    "text": "We don't have a lot of Korean restaurants in Charlotte so when I saw this one while I was down in Matthews for an appointment, I immediately decided to go try it.  The restaurant is part grocery store and has a very low budget feel to it. The front door is actually an emergency exit (which was very misleading) and the actual entrance is through the side door.  The food was delicious! We ordered the Korean BBQ pork, shrimp fried rice and kimchi pancakes. All of the food was very flavorful and delicious.  The inside of the restaurant could be a little more lively and clean. My only issue though, was the \"silverware\" they provided. My parents don't use chopsticks so they were given flimsy plastic forks. I used chopsticks but the ones provided were the disposable kind, very poorly made and splintered. I hurt my hand in three different places. We just gave up and started eating with the steel spoons they gave us for the sauces. Because of that, I only give them three stars.",

Seat yourself and press the little button on your table for service. The staff are nice and efficient.  The menu is extensive. Be brave and order something new and let your tastebuds have some fun and adventure. I say that and yet, I order the same thing every time: Dol sot bi bim bap (hot pot). It's delicious and hearty.",

    "text": "I had Sunday lunch with a friend for my birthday. We were there from 12:30-2:10. The food was great!! The food came out fast, hot, and fresh. The two stars were for the great food!  It was not busy when we got there and yes it did progressively get busy during our stay but our service today was just horrible. Probably with only two waitresses for a busy Sunday crowd of church goers coming in.  We had ordered hot green tea with our food and apparently we only get the small 6 ounce cup and that's it? We asked for a cup of ice water several times with no success. We asked for a refill on hot tea several times as well but the waitress acted confused when she finally acknowledged us, like why are you asking for more, and said she can only give us more hot water. Ok? Often, when I've ordered hot tea anywhere else I often get a pot of hot tea or at least hot water. The waitress accidentally left a cup of ice water that was meant for the table across from us in her frazzled hurry to get us the hot water refill for us, so my friend and I ended up  sharing that cup after it was obvious the waitress was not acknowledging us.  There were six tables at the small section we sat at and our server constantly walked by and checked up on the two tables behind us and the two tables in front of us but did not check on us or look at us. Not once.  When asked for our bill and containers for our food, she went and checked on the table beside us when she came back ten minutes later, gave them our bill, and then took the containers to the other room. While waiting, the couple across from us finally gave our bill when they realized it wasn't theirs. The waitress got flustered when we asked for containers again because she said she already gave them to us.   When we paid, she asked \"Is that was all you pay? This has no tip\" and pointed out the amount due on the receipt (we had given her $25 cash plus the remaining $23 or so on debit). We did not leave a generous tip unfortunately because we spent more time waiting for more tea, more water, for the waitress to come by and acknowledge us, our containers, and our bill than we did eating (30 minutes max was spent eating at the most because I was literally just waiting for some service so I could just leave).   And for the other waitress to come after us and point out that we did not leave a tip and then that our tip was not at least a 10% tip was pretty inconsiderate. We did explain what happened though. She did a apologize for the poor service and acknowledged she would discuss this the waitress.   Note: the couple across from us left no tip at all!!   I am by no means a rude customer trying to be annoying or get away with not leaving tips. I try to always be nice, courteous, and considerate to waiters and waitress and give therm the benefit of the doubt but I truly also believe waiters and waitresses need to do their part at the very least. Not just take your order, bring the food and drinks, and then bring your bill.",

A lot of times not worth the wait... long wait to sit, long wait to order drinks, long wait to get your drinks, long wait to order your food, extra long wait to get your food, and then a long wait to even get your check and for them to come back to pick it back up. Sat in traffic to eat here, and let me remind you this time it's during an odd hour so the service shouldn't be too long. Well surprise! It was! Probably never coming back again.",

The only problem I have with it is the small portion and relatively high pricing when compared to other Korean eateries in town. The food is good though. I've had the Kalbi, and the Jang Bong Noodles. The Kalbi is pretty good, but it really wasn't enough food for 2 even though the menu says it was for 2. The Jang Bong noodles were ok. They didn't put any shrimp in it though. It's supposed to be a seafood noodle, I've always had Jang Bong with shrimp in it. Due to the pricing and the portions,  I probably just eat at G-mart from now on instead.",

Both dishes were very good and are served with a few different side dishes.  Usually kimchi, soup and a couple other different vegetables.

All the food was excellent, the soup broth was rich in taste, though it was very red, it was not really spicy (the only downside). The fried squid came in a really nice bbq sauce, and it was obvious that the ingredients were fresh. The side dishes were yummy too, fresh kimchi ftw.  In short, PePeRo offers great food and even better price!!!",

Service was attentive (little \"service\" bell on the table as the kitchen is out of eye sight of the dining room) and fast. I ordered the seafood & tofu soup. It was served hot, well seasoned spice wise and not too salty. Plenty of big chunks of tofu and seafood. I also ordered the dolsot bibimbap. Came out sizzling, as it should, with a slightly fried egg on top. It mixed up well and formed that nice crispy rice on the bowl walls. Great, freshly prepared meal with a nice variety of sides.

Bipimbop was good, but not great, but after two years in the Bay Area I'm an unfairly harsh critic.  Hitting the expansive adjacent market after our meal was as much a part of the evening as the meal.

    "text": "It seems like whenever I come here, it always makes me gasp in shock. This isn't the first time I had a negative experience at this particular place. Last time I came here I was basically accused that I put a strand of my hair in the food that I ordered. (we had the food in the middle of the table so that my family could share everything. Plus, the strand of hair that I found was deep inside where I had to literally dig through the noodle.) Now you are thinking I'm exaggerating, right? Nope. The  lady owner came up to me, in quote, \"Student, this hair can never be our hair. Your hair must've fallen when you were eating.\" I was flabbergasted. She also told us that we still need to pay because we finished half of it. Well, no shit, since the hair was INSIDE the soup.   Now, recently, I came here to eat lunch. I ordered kimchi soup with soft tofu inside and a fish. I didn't see any problem with that because I have ordered this 3 times in a row. The only reason I come here to eat is because of this menu until she ruined it for me. Anyways, I called to put in the order because the service is pretty slow here. When I arrive, the waitress tells me we don't serve that anymore and that the owner would like to speak to me. So I sit down. The same owner comes to me and says, \"Hello, so you ordered kimchijigaesoontofu(basically kimchi soup with soft tofu)? Don't ever order it again since this is not on the menu. You don't have to come back here anymore. This will be the last time we serve this to you, okay? \" Ladies, gentlemen, is this how a customer should be treated? The way she approached me was appalling. ALL restaurants should be accustomed of altering the food when a customer is allergic or would like to replace something with something. All I was asking for was kimchisoup with soft tofu inside. Is that hard? As she told me, I will never return here. Even right now I am very heated up about this circumstance. For an owner to tell a customer that to basically never return again just because the restaurant can't handle something so little is very disappointing.   So as the owner told me, I will never ever return to this place.",

I am however an expert on things that are delicious and this place is exactly that. The seafood pancake is crispy on the outside and full of chewy deliciousness on the inside, the short ribs are sweet and savory. Even something as basic as beef fried rice is made with a little extra sweet Korean love. I love this place and I am here often. This is a mom and pops so just know that it looks and feels like exactly that.",

    "text": "There are not too many places/restaurants that serve Korean food in the Charlotte area. There is a small one in \"Super G\" an uber Asian supermarket and China Wing that serves Korean along with Chinese food, but Pe Pe Ro is all Korean and it's, in my humble korean ass opinion, the best in Charlotte.  Don't let the lack of glitz, nor the fact that it's attached to an Asian but predominantly Korean supermarket, fool you ; they can throw down as far as making Korean food!    That said, the decor is sparse and tacky as only Koreans can manage, but the dining area is decent in size and comfortable enough.  The service is driven by family folks which is fine and they do a good job in making sure you are doing ok, i.e. needing any replenishment of banchans (basically communal side dishes), and drinks.  The food makes up for it in spades.   I'm dieting, but the family ordered  steamed buns, japchae (sauteed translucent noodles, with carrots,  beef, fish cakes,  and green onions), and dukgook soup (basically rice cakes, dumplings,  eggs, and slices of beef, in a delicious broth).  The banchans can vary but tonight its bean sprouts,  seaweed,  cucumber kimchee,  regular cabbage kimchee,  and fish cakes.  It was shark eyes all around!!  Prices are reasonable for Korean food standards;  japchae was 1099 and soup was 999, and mondu 599.  So not bad!! If you are craving Korean food and are in the area Pe Pe Ro is really the only option, but I'd still say a must try!!",

I walked in the side door to a little store with a room with people in it. The waiter was nice and showed me to my seat. It was a very quaint spot that reminded me of places abroad. Often places are the most ascetically pleasing to the eye but the best with the home cooked vibe. I e always wanted to try Bi Bim Bop and boy was I happy with the food. It came in a clay pot which was sizzling. The sides were a variety of the things that I couldn't pronounce but good none the less. I highly recommend this spot for a good homey meal and just curiosity of Korean culture.  I hope to come back and get more food!!",

I shopped and purchased a few items then returned another day to visit the restaurant.  I have actually enjoyed the restaurant food a number of times.  I make a note of what others are eating (when it looks good) in order to give it a try on my next visit.  I enjoy Bi Bim Bob, Seafood Pancake, Dduk Boy, Yook Gae Jang (spicy soup makes my nose run), and Kimchi Fried Rice.  I have engaged one family member who loves the Kimchi fried rice as much as I do.  Planning a restaurant visit is exciting.  Still, there is no way I can eat as much as others.  Once I have the soup, I can't each much more.    However, I do take home my leftovers and enjoy them for lunch the next day!    I am giving PePeRo 4 stars because I have nothing to compare them to in the Charlotte area.  That said, they may well deserve 5 stars.",

First of all, I don't like bean sprouts or cucumbers normally, but these were so tasty and went extremely well with the main dish.   Locating the place and exactly where to turn is hard, the entrance to the parking lot has a small concrete median to separate incoming and outgoing traffic. There are many places to make U-turns if you miss it the first time around :)   Finding the entrance also had me walking in circles, one would think the front doors facing the street were the entrance. Not the case here, lol, entrance is on the right side of the building if you are looking at it from Monroe. Exactly where to order was not ever apparent, but I just stood around, smiled, and someone came to help me.   The food was amazing, I will come back here if I am ever in this area again! I did however feel out of place as all of the people here were Korean and I am not, but no one was rude to me :) just the opposite. Visit this restaurant if you enjoy flavorful and spicy foods, you won't regret it. Also it is connected to a little shop that has all types of Korean things from food to hair dye!",

Cons: the place is mom and pop so it hasn't had a make over in a while; sometimes the wait is long if they are  very busy and there are also occasionally fruit flies since they serve a lot of fermented things.   This would be a hidden gem if it just had a make over and they could do something about the occasional fruit flies. If you can get over that (and you should) this place is highly recommended.",

    "text": "Imagine my surprise when an Atlanta native who has also lived in DC finds (traditional) Korean food in Charlotte!  Food is pretty True to classic Korean flavor, but the -1 star comes for the slower service and one cautionary note.   Addtionally, in a Korean restaurant, a party typically receives their side dishes + rice first to pick at before receiving their main dish, but that is personal preference.  Note that if you're feeling adventurous, please stay away from the very ends of the spectrum (e.g., I love pork sausage soup, but given that it isn't ordered often, I found the soup delicious but the noodles in the sausage were old and tasted as if they were frozen).",

My favorite food is Korean and I know it can be difficult to find decent Korean food in some cities.  So I was ecstatic to find Pepero!   I have been there four or five times in the past few months.  The quality of the food has been excellent each time. I usually order the Samgyeopsal (pork), it's served as \"spicy pork with vegetables\". I usually get the yakimandoo (a simple pan-fried meat and veggie dumpling), which have been great as well. The restaurant is tucked in the back of their Korean food shop.  So, most of the ingredients you eat at the restaurant can be purchased at the shop up front.  They even sell kimchi! Anyways, I highly recommend Pepero!",

The small size is good enough for two people. We didn't wait long for our food. Service is great there. They have a service button on each table which I love.

I always zoom by this house of deliciousness on the dreaded drive to Wilmington, \"tryin to get out before the traffic hits\" or \"annoyed at all the stoplights lets just get home dammit\" so I've never stopped.  Stupid.  Store is full, cheap, and has decent produce. Front door is to the side, don't be nerdy me all scrambling to get in, just head for the green awning.  Obviously Korean in emphasis, with random Jap and Chinese sauces, dumplings, etc (some Viet products as well). Prices were consistent with Super G + Asian Corners. 15 pound bags of rice for cheap. Bags of chili powder, enough to throw a pillow case over and sleep on, 5 bucks.  But the real fun is to be had down the mysterious hallway, \"restaurant\" sign draped across the door, smells wafting out, battling the dried fish and pickly aromas from the shelves and freezers. Hmm, sesame. Oooh, I hear something sizzling. Big, printed vinyl menu hung sideways, so you have to stoop and stick your head through the window to place an order. Either these guys know exactly how to slay the hole-in-the-wall loving crew or they're a little nuts. Let's go with the latter.  So there's Soondubu, there's BiBimBap, there's fried noodles and fried rice, vegetarians. Pretty sure there's no fried tofu in this joint, only super silky soft. She knew what I was talking about I-no-eat-animals-wise and listed the things they'd leave out to properly fill my order (with a slightly sad face, like she thought I was missing out, awesome).   And I get more stew than I can possibly, ever eat, complete with pickles of every type - a mild kimchi, sprouts, sweet yam, and not one but TWO poached eggs, gooooood god. Small cup of white rice. I couldn't stop, and now I need a nap.  Love ya PePe.",

I read some funny reviews for this place.  A word of warning.  If you are strictly vegetarian, I am convinced that something will get lost in translation, and you will likely be eating some sort of animal product, probably fish.  Even though you ask for the meat to be taken out, the concept of vegetarian is disturbing for Korean cooks.  I have watched many a vegetarian eat dishes where they asked all meat to be removed, and watched them eat the results which clearly had once breathing protein.  However,  they enjoyed the dishes so much, i didn't have the heart to tell them what they were actually eating.  I hope I don't go to hell for that.  Anyway, I bought some frozen mandoo and kimchee, and they both taste great.  My next project is to cook a korean meal with products from this store.  I will update this review with the recipe's and results.  Probably next month.",

It's a bit awkward and a little more awkward once you get in because you don't know what to do. LOL! Half of it is a shop and the other half is the restaurant. But you'll be greeted with smiling faces and they'll ask if you're dining and sit you down. Once you've got a seat, it's smooth from there on.   Pricing is very good, compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. My dish cost around $9-$11 while at other places it runs to $15.  It feels like eating at home, but with someone serving, cooking, and cleaning for you. The decorations on the wall are beautiful and sometimes they have cute decorations on the table too. All the food is always served with fresh yummy sides. Our favorite sides are the bean sprouts, spinach, and the fishcake (I believe it's fish cake). I always get the same thing each time because I just love it so much: Yuk Gae Jang. You MUST try their fried rice. I don't know why it's so good! It leaves you wanting more after one bite. I love how they serve their water. It's definitely not from the sink.  If it's your first time eating Korean, it's always safe to go with a Kalbi or Bulgogi dish. You can venture out when you're brave enough. And like I said in my other reviews, go with a group, so you can try their dishes lol.    My niece loves going here because they have a \"bell\" service where you press a button and a bell goes off in the backroom to let them know if we need anything. They come and check up on you too, so it's not like they're sitting around for the bell.",

The spicy pork bulgogi was not as good as Chow Wan Garden's in my opinion. It was good but not as good and I'd rather drive a few miles further at that point.

This is probably a quintessential \"hidden gem\"...in that it's probably the best authentic Korean restaurant in Charlotte, yet literally \"hidden\" inside a rather shoddy, rough-looking Korean grocery store.   Honestly, it's a bit funny. You enter this grocery store-restaurant from a side door (as the front door is blocked for some odd reason)...and well, this side entrance area is beyond bad lol. Once you step inside, you'll see the grocery section to the left, and Pepero to the right.  Given how I always came here with my parents or friends in the past, my husband has never been here! Well, tonight, I managed to drag him out to finally check out this place.   We ordered the Seafood Pancake, Galbi and Tangsuyuk...and expected, they were all good. Tangsuyuk was solid, as always. Think Tangsuyuk, along with Jjajangmyun, has always been my favorite dishes here...though my parents always raved about their authentic stews. However, I must admit that there were a few disappointments. Though perfectly delicious, the Galbi was rather skimpy in portion...and the Seafood Pancake was really weak compared to what I had in the past here, as well as elsewhere. I was also sad to hear that they didn't carry Galbi Jjim, my ultimate favorite Korean dish. No matter, we had no problem eating every bit of what we ordered, including all of their complimentary sides.  Anyway, after our experience here, my husband agreed with my assessment of this place....that is, surprisingly good food in a \"hidden\" dive! Still, as much as I love the food here, I don't return here as often as I should. Why? The Flies! Possibly due to the flies' attraction to Kimchi and/or the fact that the restaurant is just inches away from the swinging door, I've had to deal with flies throughout my meals here on more than one occasion. Anyone that knows me know that I absolutely hate insects...really more of a phobia! So no, it's not about the lack of ambiance (and yes, it's quite the dive) or the sanitation grade (which is surprisingly good)...but the frickin' Flies!! I only wish they can get this problem under control.   Despite a few issues, I'm sure to return...and husband is also willing to return to try a few other popular dishes, like their amazing Jjajangmyun! Like I said, this is probably the best authentic Korean food you'll find in Charlotte...so you have to be willing to make a few compromises lol. If not, Koreatown in Duluth, GA, with its many 4-5 star Korean restaurants, is less than 4 hours away!",

This time we got there around 815pm and the restaurant, albeit a small restaurant, only had 1 open table left. Service was great, and food was much improved. Banchan was ok. Not the best I've had. Pricing is a bit on the high side for what you get but it was pretty good. The stirfry was flavorful and plentiful. The seagood pancake was nice and crisp on outside and pancaky on the inside. Really well cooked. They closed at 9 but there were still plenty of people eating and shopping at the grocery section around 915. The servers and store clerk all looked happy and not annoyed. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

The place was exactly what my Yelp pals stated.  Ed C, Abby L, Lori L, Taryn R, and Fleece P were all dialed in--it's a dive.   A small Asian grocery is attached (note: use the side door).  Of course I shopped there,  too.  Service was similar to most Asian, family ran establishments both here and abroad.  Pleasant. Precise. Perfunctory.  Just the facts, ma'am.  I say \"Give 'em a whirl,\" and see for yourself.  There's more going on than a bowl of soup.",

We dined there yesterday and literally had to ask for refills of water (we got one refill during the entire dinner). We had to constantly ask for napkins and refills of our small plates.   No one checked on us and it began to feel like we were begging for their service. It got to the point when we had already eaten and was waiting for the check for no joke, 1 hour. They did have a few other customers, and were very short staffed but we literally had to just go stand by the door with cards in hand to show that we were ready to go. We were stuck there for two hours. Keep in mind we only had ONE water refill and a total of 6 napkins amongst the three of us. I'm going to give them some time to work on their service issue. But I will return solely for the food; it maybe best to take it to-go.   Love the food but the service is horrible.",

I loved that they bring out small plates of cucumbers, kimchi, rice cakes, greens, and bean sprouts. They were all so delicious. I ordered the yaki udon noodles for my meal. It was really good.   The staff is very helpful and friendly. I'm excited to go back and try some other menu items. I was not the biggest fan of the steamed or the yaki mandoo, I would not get again. They are vegetarian options, though, which was nice.   Overall, awesome little hidden gem. A must try if you love Asian food as much as I do.",

First off, do not judge them for having you enter through their side door instead of their front door, even though this looks really questionable at night. The restaurant is adjacent to the small grocery store. We were seated right away. I had the dol sot bi bim bop, $10.99. For those of you who worry about too much spiciness (like me), have no fear! They put the gochujang sauce on the side so you can add as much or as little as you please. It came with 5 side dishes, 4 of which were spicy - kimchi with lettuce, zucchini, radish, and tofu skin plus non-spicy bean sprouts. I would have liked to have more non-spicy options. The bibimbop was absolutely delicious! I especially loved the fresh zucchini, but the whole combination was fantastic! Staff did not check on us unless we rang the bell at our table. Overall, a very good experience. They even sell kimbap at the attached grocery store! Everything is a bit overpriced at the store, but come here for the restaurant!",

There was so much to choose from but I asked what was most popular in the noodle section. The name of the dish escapes me but I'm sure if you ask they will tell you. I was skeptical because this was a completely new place for me but it turned out to be so good! Even my son liked it and he's a picky 6 year old. Definitely would recommend stopping by if you are in the area. The entree cost about $11 but I'd say they give you a pretty big portion so I didn't trip. I would definitely go again!

I have gotten the hot pot Bibbimbap each time I have gone. In a hot stone pot, there is rice, beef, vegetables and some seasonings. I usually like to add a bit of the hot sauce to it. With all of their meals come the \"appetizers\" of cucumbers cut up, kimchi, bean sprouts, rice cakes, and greens. My siblings and my parents always seem to vary what they order.  The dining area has about 6 tables and can seat about 35 people. It can get busy during peak meal times. Everything is neat and clean. Service can be a bit slow. I do love this place and look forward to coming every time I am in town.  The parking lot is ample, and the entrance is easy to get in and out of. The building itself is nondescript and white.

I will say the seafood pancake was too much flour and too skimpy with the seafood and I feel like the food and market attached to the restaurant could be a little cheaper, but hey if this is the most authentic Korean place in Charlotte I get it. I will definitely be coming back!!!",

    "text": "Quaint little Korean restaurant inside a grocery store. This place is so much better than the one inside G Mart!   The hubs and I come here often whenever we get a craving for authentic Korean food and don't feel like driving 3 hours to Duluth, GA (that city is Korea-Town!)   We pretty much order the exact same thing every time we're here. I keep saying I'll try something different but our usual is so friggin delicious- why risk it?   We start with the seafood pancake which is loaded with squid, octopus, shrimp, mussels, faux crab and sometimes even scallops. This is served with a soy dipping sauce that perfectly compliments the dish without overpowering it.   My usual is jjampong, a seafood soup with veggies and Udon noodles. I can NEVER finish a bowl. Even when I share with the hubs and the rugrats, there's still leftovers- there's just so much food in one serving. The dish used to be $10 and they've sinced upped the price to $13, but let me tell you - it's worth so much more than what you pay for.   The hubs gets bulgolgi cause let's face it - that's a staple and should always be eaten when going to a Korean joint. Not getting bulgolgi is like not getting the fries at McDonald's- you just HAVE to get it!  The meat is always super flavorful and tender. It's served with Korean rice which is a short grain, slightly sticky grain, similar to what's used in sushi. I enjoy the different texture since I usually eat jasmine rice at home.   To top it all off, they serve the best ban Chan in the Charlotte area. You get kimchi, cucumber kimchi, seaweed salad, seasoned bean sprouts and my all time fave - stir fried fish cakes. I know I know - sounds pretty weird. But it's delicious! So good that I always purchase some on the side to-go so I can enjoy it when I'm eating Shin Ramen at home.   There's been a surge of new Korean joints popping up around Charlotte and some are pretty good but none is as authentic as this place. Those new spots cater to the American palette. I prefer the real deal here.",

She horsed around with us all lunch long, cracking jokes, giving out high fives, and making spot on suggestions, including \"stop drinking so much water -- you'll pee the bed!\"   Our group of 3 dinners ordered a small kimchi pancake to share and I ordered the pork bul go gi. The pancake, despite getting the small, was huge! We all did our best to make a dent and still left 2 pieces behind. The pork bul go gi was delicious! It was spicy but the rice it came with helped cool my mouth down. I'm going to have a hard time not ordering the same thing every time!   My friends ordered the bi bim bob and jab chae. I tired and liked both. We also had an assortment of little side dishes. Some were identifiable (is that meat or tofu?!?) but all were tasty. My favorites were the seaweed (which we incorrectly pegged as spinach at first) and bean sprouts/curd.   Be sure to spend a little time wandering through the attached market either before or after lunch. I spent a good 10 minutes ogling all the foreign-to-me items and went home with some cookies & cream pocky sticks that were a perfect, sweet treat after that spicy pork!",

For some reason, all the Korean restaurants found their way in the Matthews area and after consulting my trusty Yelp, checked this place out based on the prior reviews.  Met my expectations and my hankering, but didn't blow my mind.  The portions were decent and the hubs and I were able to share a Bibimbop and an appetizer and still have leftovers.  I was disappointed there weren't more side dishes offered (we only got two and a soup), but it was good enough.  The service was decent, but only checked with us when we called them.  No proactive checking in with us otherwise.  The place is really easy to pass by without realizing you missed it.  It's tucked away in a grocery store and you would think you are in somebody's house instead of a restaurant.  I don't know that I would come back here again, unless I find out all the other Korean places in Charlotte aren't up to par.",

The day before we were in Charleston eating Korean at the only Korean place in town and the food was ok not what we wanted having lived in the Bay area for 20 years so when I yelped Charlotte and found this place I had high expectations. Yes it is small and located in the back of the grocery store. The menu is small and many meals are priced for 2 people so because we each wanted a different item our selection was small. They would not substitute tofu for meat in my meal bi bim bob which I was disappointed. The beef in the bi bim bob was ground beef which I will not eat. The sides were generous, fish cakes, kimchi, cukes , bean sprout and a sea weed dish. I was hoping for the potatoes but not offered. The crusty rice in my hot pot tasted of canola oil :(  I would not recommend this place. A sad lunch when I had high hopes of a good meal.",

PePeRo is a good place for your first Korean meal because they have a wide variety of items on their menu including beef, pork and seafood.  If you have questions about a particular dish, just ask the staff and they will guide you.  The seafood pancakes and kimchi pancakes are fantastic; I could make a meal out of them.  When you order an entree, it comes with several side dishes that are shared among your table with refills if needed.  They are never overstaffed so if you need attention, press the button on the table and you will be promptly helped.  Don't wait for them to approach your table if you need something.   They do not serve alcohol so no soju here unfortunately.",

The wait was long but it was busy on a Friday night. I think I will stick with green tea, but we ate everything. Then walked around the store like a giddy kid. I bought a body bar of soap with oats, peppermint candy, sweet bun, and my favorite Korean Pears. I don't want to try any other place in Charlotte. I know that is not fair, but it is 2 in 1.

It is a beef rib soup that reminds me of Korea. The bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi is awesome too. You get plenty of food for a low price. In awesome Korean tradition they fill the table with side dishes. I love Pepero. The staff is very friendly as well.

They had a nice spread at the counter you ordered from and the pictures of everything on the menu in nice big color shots. I was only in Grenville for 1 year and came back to Charlotte, my home.  I was looking on yelp and noticed PePeRo a while back  but never went to Matthews,  Yesterday I was browsing through yelp and clicked on Korean and read the recent reviews and decided I had to go tonight!.  The Kitchen was clean and the rating was upper 90s which is rare for Korean restaurants. The waitress was young and friendly and spoke good English! :) I decided on the JAE YUK DUP BOB ( spicy stir fried pork over rice)  First out came the little side dishes Koreans eat with their meals, banchan,, (cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, bean sprout, 2 I could not recognize, so asked the waitress and marinated radish and marinated sprouts0 It came out looking and smelling clean and fresh! Then came the main dish and a small bowl of Miso soup. everything was Delicious and fresh and I cant wait to go back.  The menu has each dish pictured with Korean name with English translation below. They are open until10:00 PM nightly except Sunday until 8:00PM",

Also the service is a little slow so don't go if you are in a rush or on your way to the movies. Overall, I highly recommend.",

They also have ice cream stored conveniently as you are entering /leaving the restaurant  ^^  Korean ice cream is the best! It's a perfect treat, don't miss out ~ only one thing, I wish they had an outside table so you can enjoy the beautiful summer weather and ice cream at the same time !",

I ordered the Bulgogi & my hubby ordered the Galbi. His dish was a healthy portion & still enough to share with me. My Bulgogi was perfect. I ordered the smaller size serving & it was still a nice portion. I was full by the time I finished. There is a button you push for service, so we pushed it for refills of drinks & of sides. The staff was always pleasant & willing to help. Service was definitely done with a smile. The restaurant was kept at a decent temp, not too hot or cold. It does get loud occasionally, but I think it's more of a \"not understanding the language\" type deal. I truly enjoyed my dinner & the prices! How can I forget about those. This was the most decently priced meal I've had! Everything was under $17-18 (1-2 people can eat) or under $11 (1 person). Delish!",

    "text": "This is always my go to place if I have a craving for Korean food.  People might get confused upon walking in as you'll see a supermarket towards the left, and a kinda restaurant ahead and towards the right (there two rooms for the restaurant).    This is a pretty poppin authentic place.  On cold nights, order the tofu soup, my fav!!  It's delicious!  My other favorite dish is the jjambong.  I might have spelled that wrong, but it's the seafood noodle soup.  If you order that, I would advise against ordering any appetizers as that is such a big bowl to finish!  If you can finish it within one sitting, kudos to you man...kudos to you.  I never can.  I love this place for the authentic (or as authentic to my knowledge) Korean food in town.  I do love it, but then their kitchen is kind of slow, so be patient when it comes to getting your food.  That is the only reason why they didn't get a full 5 stars from me.  Make sure to order first, and THEN chit chat with your homies.  Check out the supermarket for some fun Korean snacky snacks.  As Professor Umbridge makes Harry Potter write during detention, \"I must not tell lies.\"  I ALWAYS go to the sweet snack section every trip to Pepero.  It's a tradition.  I'm not much of a cook, but check out what other goodies they sell there too.  If you want just a jar a kimchee, they have some for you to buy!  Convenient!  This place is awesome, so go visit it!   Gomawo! (Informal way to say \"thank you\" in Korean.  Trust me, I WikiHow'd it.)",

Now, I don't think I am the foremost expert on Korean food and judging its authenticity but I can easily say that this was exactly what I was looking for.  A little hole in the wall Korean Grocery store with a quaint restaurant in the back.  It had one section for booths and one section for tables.  Each table had a service bell on the table when you are ready.  Otherwise, the staff will leave you the F alone (which can be nice sometimes rather than being bugged ever two seconds).    On to the food....  I ordered the Pork Bo go bi (something like that, hahaha).  It was.... BANGING!  It came over some white rice and was cooked in a full-flavored kimchi type sauce.  The spice was perfect for me (not a huge fan of really spicy) and it didn't take over the taste at all.  Just right!  Also, the sides were a perfect compliment.  They were free and they were basically little sample dishes:  seaweed salad, kimchi, sauteed veggies.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

When the waitress took the food to us, she called the food in Korean name, of course we didn't know. So she was very rude with a large sound 'bang' to put the food on table.

There were empty tables but the waiter kept telling us there were people eating there. We also had to grab our own menus, repeatedly press the service button just to order (no one came.) We had to request for refills which took a few minutes for them to just grab a can from the back. The only time the servers came by our table was to give us our food and our check. We were never asked how the food was.   But like i said. The food was amazing, im just not sure if it was worth it for dealing with such bad service.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been loyal customers for almost a year now. We visit at least twice a month. He loves their galbi, so that's his usual order. I tend to switch between a soup or the spicy pork galbi. The food, along with the sides, is typically good. Service is a hit or miss. If they're busy, they will neglect you for a long time, and the bell buttons on each table are not very helpful. The waitresses tend to panic when they get busy. Regardless, my boyfriend and I have always left tip.   Today, service was terrible. We arrived around 8:30pm. Many customers were already finished eating at this point, so it wasn't so busy. Our waitress must have already been in a bad mood because she wasn't very attentive. We never got our drinks refilled. She also wasn't very happy when my boyfriend asked for a fork and extra plate. At around 9:15pm, we asked for extra sides. She said their kitchen closed, even though the restaurant was still open until 10:00pm. Fine. At 9:30pm, a family came in. The same waitress seated them and took their order. We thought the kitchen was closed? Confused, my boyfriend and I decided at this point that we would not leave a generous tip. We left a $2 tip and left. Then the waitress came running after us. She was baffled that we left such a small tip and she strongly believed that she offered us good service tonight.   First of all, who runs after customers to ask for more tip? The amount of the tip is based on YOUR service--and although it is highly recommended, it is still the customer's choice. After adding an additional $5 tip, I told her that my boyfriend and I have enjoyed coming to this restaurant, but that we will no longer be coming. And that will be the final tip from us.",

    "text": "I always like to venture out and try new things which led me to this place. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat down. The waitress was full of life, very nice and helpful. We ordered galbi, bibimbap in a hot pot, black bean noodles, kimchee soup and tofu soup. The galbi was expensive ($17.99 for a serving for one) but was delicious! The lady was nice enough to tell us what sauce she used and not many cooks do that. The bibimbap was good but I just wanted a little more beef in it. We always see the black bean noodles on kdramas so decided to give it a try. Sadly, we weren't big fans of the black bean noodles. It had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of flowers, it has an acquired taste. My mom loved the kimchee soup. The soft tofu soup was good, the only downfall was that there was seafood in it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SEAFOOD but it gave the soup a very gamy taste. I liked how they had a supermarket right beside it so you can shop afterwards. We ended up getting some soju and trying it at home. Not a very big fan of soju, lol. It tastes like rubbing alcohol if anyone is curious. Food is a little expensive but good quality. The waitress gave us a homey feeling and still came to talk to us while we shopped around to let us know what was good. I recommend PePeRo's to anyone wanting to try Korean food!",

    "text": "First off, I'm Korean. I've eaten at this place on and off for 11 years with my family and friends and I recently moved back to Charlotte after being gone for 2 years. Even while out of town I came here and I suggested this place a lot as a previous member of NAAAP Charlotte before moving. However, today I had a pretty bad experience. It made me embarrassed for the establishment. What cost me 11 bucks, will cost them thousands in the future. You won't believe what happened next...  I just moved back to town and I thought I would order one of my death bed meals which is sauteed squid or ojingoh dubap, which is just \"over rice\".I know you guys go crazy over the beef but it's super easy to make so I don't eat out for that. I ordered Kimchi pajun \"pancake\" to-go for my wife as well. When it came out, it was literally too salty (too much reduced soy sauce) to eat. I stopped and told ajumma (honorific respect word for a mature lady who isn't necessarily your family, learn a little Korean while we're at it lol). I didn't eat it. She told me she'd check and I can tell the chef/manager/owner told her that she would not remake it and she said she can add some vegetables so that it wasn't as salty...What?! This is the dishonorable part. Instead of making it over so I don't die of hypertension right there, she said could mask it with vegetables so I don't taste it as much.   She did, I tasted it...still could. So I politely got up and told the son who was at the front about my experience and he went back and talked with his mother/chef/owner/manager and said that it was all the same since I started eating there in 2007. False. Did not take off the meal at the very least I mean come on, I didn't eat it?! you've got to be kidding, is the establishment that hard up for money these days or did I turn them off? I didn't argue or make a scene to make anyone angry. Usually honor is at stake here, and this is not usually how this plays out. I am still shocked. I gave a 5 buck cash tip anyway because it wasn't ajumma's fault and for some reason I felt embarrassed bringing it up but alas I'm born and raised here and it's not ok to stick it to me...but the consequence is this review and my passion for taking friends and colleagues to enjoy my food just won't happen here. So while I'm at it Super G Mart has a Korean counter in the back and is Korean owned. They always have a better and fresher variety of groceries anyway so I guess I'll go there for now on. Did I mention I paid for a meal I didn't eat?! When's the last time you did that for yourself?! Buyer beware from today on, maybe cash troubles?",

I couldn't really get past the fact that the place was such a dump.  I get the whole \"dive\" thing but this was straight up grimy..  I am surprised I didn't see any roaches during my stay but the atmosphere is one that would certainly encourage such a visitor.    The service was decent, not friendly but somewhat efficient I suppose.  The food was just not my thing.  Maybe I don't like \"authentic korean\" but even the shrimp fried rice was gross.  The bbq was bland and there was nothing else we tried that was memorable.  I realize I am not an expert when it comes to Korean food but if this is the best Charlotte has to offer then either Charlotte needs more Korean restaurants or I can confidently say I don't enjoy Korean food.  Either way, I wouldn't come back here.",
