Prices on the menu are for the half priced portions, but you order and receive the full portion, at the full portion price. But no one tells you this. So glad we looked at the bill and remembered what the price of our dishes were. This is unfair and deceptive business practice. I guarantee the majority of people dining there have no idea. I'm happy to pay more for a larger portion but don't be shady and deceive your patrons.",

    "text": "I think the food quality has been covered through most of the other reviews, but I'd like to pitch in as well.  APPS: Saganaki is fantastic. Between two people it's a good amount of food when paired with the pita bread.  ENTREES: Lamb Burger is fantastic. I've gotten it twice and it's been perfect both times. Recommend the greek potatoes as the side. Also the Lasagna is impressive and has great flavor. The portion is enough to definitely take some home.  SERVICE: Great service.   This is really where they did a great job. We went on a Wednesday night for an anniversary dinner but I wasn't sure what time we'd go so I didn't make a reservation. Well the restaurant was packed and we had the option of taking a table outside. It was a little chilly but they turned on the heater for us, however it just didn't have the same feel / ambiance as it does inside. So we said we weren't sure if we were going to be able to stay (40 min wait) since we couldn't be inside. Manager was the one that came to check on us and he immediately found us a table and set us up for dinner. Don't know where the table came from but I'm not complaining because they really saw to make sure we had a good dining experience. We'll be back many times in the future.",

The wait staff here are slow and I cannot even emphasize this enough. SLOOOOOOOOOW. The waiter acknowledged my table, but walked by several times (it was not too busy when we arrived either). When he finally got to our table, I did need an extra minute or two to view the menu. Then I did not see him for 15 minutes. Literally 15 minutes. I almost walked out and just as I was about to, he arrived to take my order. From the order time, it took another 25 minutes to get the food. The food was just okay to be honest. Not bad by any means, but certainly not great, not given the time I waited.   I don't know how anyone on a timed lunch could get in and out of this place in an hour or less. So if you are going to try it out, be prepared to wait. I certainly won't be back simply because of the wait times. The food is just not that stellar to wait that long.",

    "text": "Having been to their original location, I was thrilled when they opened at Quail Corners, closer to where I live!  Finally went there last night with some friends.  I must admit we were all underwhelmed which was very disappointing based on the rave reviews from friends!  First, they didn't have the chardonnay we ordered.  Our waitress then suggested another one which was $12 more.  We told her if they would sell it for the price of the wine we ordered, then sure, we'd take it.  Needless to say, that's not the one we ordered.  The sommelier did come over with a taste of 2 different ones which we appreciated!  I was excited to try the burrata appetizer as its description sounded delicious.  Once it arrived, we all were like \"hmm, it's a caprese salad\". Definitely not what we expected!  That should be listed in the salad section.  All of our entrees were mediocre at best.  I absolutely love scallops and was anxious to try.  Instead of the large, rich, sweet, succulent scallops most restaurants offer for a $24 entree, these were the small ones.  Again, it was just mediocre.  My friends had a pine nut tart which was described to us by our waiter as \"like pecan pie\".  I did not taste it but my friends were not impressed and told the waiter so.  At least the manager agreed to take it off our bill.  Service was mediocre as well.  We had a tag team of a waitress and waiter which became annoying b/c she had already taken our drink order and then he came over to ask if we had made any decisions on wine.  If they are going to tag team, they need to communicate!  Both were very nice but we had to ask a couple of times for water refills and we had to take our bill/credit card to the front where our waitress was just gabbing with the manager.  Not attentive service, but she was very sweet.  I won't be anxious to go back anytime soon!  But if friends choose this restaurant, I will try it again.",

The outside one would be hard-pressed to perceive the hip, spacious, and dining environment that exists behind the walls of this building.  We came in for a late lunch weekday and the restaurant was wide open with no wait. Were quickly seated and have a cocktail and appetizer orders taken almost immediately. For an appetizer we enjoyed the mediterranean spread sampler. This item featured tzatziki, baba ganoush, roasted red pepper, and hummus dips. The flavors present in these dips were authentic, fresh, and very satisfying. The dips were accompanied by warm pita slices that provided a perfect accompaniment.   For meals we enjoyed the combination of two different Mediterranean salads and a pita wrap. All of the food was fresh, promptly served, and everyone was pleased with the outcome. Additionally we were all surprised by the quality of the Greek potatoes that accompanied the pita sandwich.   Overall, we had a great experience. The service was attentive. The restaurant was clean and have an upscale vibe without being pretentious. We would definitely go back in the future when we are in town.",

Nothing to write home about. Have had better dips before. The tzatziki was nice though. Eggplant dip was not what I was used to having visited Greece and Turkey  Not so Good:  The flounder. It was SUPER dry. Like fried beyond all recognition. The sauces were nice that came with it but there wasn't enough. Both me and my friend had the same platter and both used our mezz dips to drown the fish in. Neither one of us finished the fish. Could have used more artichokes in the potato, salad artichoke thing which was mostly just potatoes and nothing spectacular about that either.   Other issue I had was that our entrees came out to soon we had barely recieved our dips when the entree came out.  Overall would recommend the place just not the flounder.",

We live about 5 minutes from this location and had been wanting to try it for quite some time. And I'm glad we did!  We did not have a reservation but chose to wait at the bar until a table opened up. We were served promptly at the bar: I ordered the Fresca Fresca cocktail (good but a little too sweet for me) and my fiance ordered the Smokey in the Rye which was a neat concept and absolutely delicious. Within only 20 minutes or so, a table opened up and we took our drinks with us.   Our waitress (I can't remember her name but she was great!) greeted us almost immediately after we sat down. She brought a complimentary dip with pita to the table (tzaziki) and it was delicious. Definitely a nice little appetizer. My fiance ordered the moussaka and I ordered the mushroom risotto with scallops. My fiance raved about this moussaka and I enjoyed my risotto, particularly the scallops which were cooked to perfection. As others have mentioned, the risotto was a little on the salty side but still very good. I'm not sure I would order it again but that's solely because I want to try more of this wonderful menu! Our waitress was also able to recommend excellent wine pairings for both of our dishes and we capped off the meal with a drunken Irishman coffee (absolutely delicious).   My fiance and I will definitely be back to this location very soon.",

We started w/a few of the sample platters, awesome and the warmed bread is superb.    A few of us got the lamb burger...HOLY S..T!!!!!!  YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!!!!!   IT IS HUGE, AWESOME, and DELICIOUS!!   I've had a few lamb burgers and this one hands down was the best i've had, others agreed.    Table had everything from salad, chicken plate, pizza, etc.   Everyone enjoyed this meal and we will definitely go back!  Pricing was very reasonable and not overpriced for what you get and the quality of food.",

If you are a novice to Greek food, do the four starter/dip plate that is a selection of humus, egg plant, peppers along with pita bread.  You can get regular or whole wheat pitas.  Crazy lasagna is unique and very delicious.  My friend had a big salad and it looked fantastic and he said it was one of the best he ever had.  Menu is Mediterranean and covers quite a variety of dishes. Portions are generous.  Hard to comment of describe other than to say that the service is great, selections many, prices reasonable and everything is savory.  Treat yourself to a selection of appetizers and you will have a great experience and learn something about Greek food.  Good place.",

I know every restaurant is different and may not even care enough but I wrote it in our reservations and I guess this restaurant is one of the restaurants that doesn't really care because our waiter was surprised when one of us told him that we were there to celebrate a few people's birthdays. I couldn't even hear him when he introduced himself because it was pretty loud in there and the live music didn't help but our waiter is the only reason I'm giving it a 3 star instead of anything lower. He was enthusiastic, funny, and perfect as a waiter for a big group. I didn't think the appetizers and entree that I had was all that good. We had the fried calamari and angry shrimp. The angry shrimp was honestly a waste of money. 4 pieces of shrimp for like $12? Really? If I knew that there was only 4 shrimp then I wouldn't have gotten it. I've had better fried calamaris elsewhere. Ordered the roast chicken and again I've had better roast chicken elsewhere. The free birthday dessert that our waiter brought out was nice and pretty interesting. It was like a cinnamon cake thing with a scoop of vanilla icecream. Overall the restaurant looks nice but the food just wasn't special enough to bring me back.",

When we got inside, the hostess tried to seat us at a table near the door, it was cold outside so we asked for another table since the restaurant was half empty. The decor is generic-upscale wanna be, there's nothing ethnic or cute about it.  We love Greek and Mediterranean food in general. We were very interested in this place and their take on that type of food. I'd say after dinning at this place that we enjoyed their appetizers more than their regular entrees. Their menu is too much of a mix of things, tries to please too much: pizza, pasta, some Greek dishes.  For appetizers we got the fried zucchini and eggplant chips (they were very good) w. cucumber yogurt and the meatballs (they're just OK).   For entrees we chose their pork chops (read good things about them) which were big, too much meat, dry, kind of bland, I couldn't sense the lemon flavor or coriander (they were supposed to have). Their fries were good. The coleslaw with olives (not the most Greek idea for a dish in the world) came later, way after they brought the pork chops with the Greek Fries. If I pay around $20 for an entree, I want all the components  that are listed in the menu to be brought in the same time (it's just coleslaw).   The service wasn't that great, they don't bring the coleslaw when they're supposed to, but then they keep coming to your table to rush you to finish the food with a typical question:\" Still working on it?\" - I'm eating, not \"working\".  Overall, this place doesn't have flavor in their food as well as in their decor.   The food lacks the Mediterranean flavors and the place lacks the Mediterranean fun!",

We went on a Saturday night and got to hear some really (and I mean really) good jazz renditions of some pop songs old and new. It added great ambiance to very classy looking place. I am not sure if this a weekly thing or not but I'd hope so. But people don't go to a restaurant for the jazz, so on to the food. They have a really good Mediterrainian menu and I hae never heard a waiter be so enthusiastic about the food. We decided it was either his first job in a restaurant of this caliber or the food was really that good. We hoped for the latter.  He sold us on a hummus plate, the short ribs and the lamb burger. All of it was out of this world. They were packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. The funny part was there were no less than eight other items our waiter was enthusiastic about. I guess we will have to go back.  While I was with a group and not on a date, I think a found a great new date spot. Terrific food and ambiance at a well reasoned price (it is more upscale but you can get out of there for $12-22 a person).",

By the time I arrived my buddy Paul had a dip platter waiting - hummus, tsatziki, eggplant & roasted pepper. It came with a bunch of pita bread -- All 4 were delicious.  I then ordered the pork belly sandwich.... I repeat, PORK BELLY sandwich...!!!! As many of you know, the belly is the pigs greatest culinary gift. It came served on pita bread and came with red onion, tomato, lettuce & tsatziki. I can't even put to words how delicious this sandwich was. It was just AMAZING...!!  Allyson had the moussaka. It was enough for Paul and I to sample and she had plenty left to take home. I've had moussaka at Greek restaurants all over the country and this is one of the BEST I've ever had.   We ate outside on the patio and as the night went on, it got a little chilly. Our server came over and as soon as we mentioned it was getting cold he turned on two heat lamps for us right away -- He was extremely attentive. In fact, the service provided by the entire staff there was beyond anything I could have possible expected or asked for.   I can't wait to go back...I'm sure that the only problem for me will be deciding on what to order.  This place is truly a hidden gem in the far corner of a strip mall. I HIGHLY recommend ilios noche quail co..!! Don't underestimate it.. Give this place a try next time you are in the area!",

Ambiance is nicer, the waitstaff was prompt and friendly, and the food was okay.  We ordered the eggplant and zucchini chips to begin.  As in the other restaurant they are way too salty.  Just completely ruins them.  We had them re-made with no salt and they were much improved (the batter probably has some salt).  My husband and me both ordered the salmon which comes with big beans underneath.  It tasted a little fishy like it was not quite fresh, and it was a little too salty, but we ate it anyway.  The beans were way too salty for me so I just ate a few. The number one biggest improvement this restaurant could make is to cut the salt; the food would be much tastier, not to mention healthier.  Big View Diner has the same problem.  PLEASE CUT THE SALT but not the flavor.  By the way my husband's rating is 2.  1 for the ambiance and 1 for the waiter.  My husband will not return but if I go again with friends I will make sure to tell them to omit the salt then add my own if there is any need.",

Basically looked like they have a huge vat of this medium quality lamb in the kitchen and the chef takes a scoop of it and plops it on top of some orzo. Good, but not $28 good. Second and final complaint; our waiter. We sat in a back corner of the restaurant, which was actually kinda romantic, but the waiter was serving both us and the table next to us at the same time. I'll give the wait staff a slight break because it was V Day and crowded, but when I'm paying $100 for a meal, I don't need my waiter calling me \"boss\" and telling my girlfriend how he and his girlfriend were \"eat light this year so they can stay up and get freaky.\" Because last year they got \"too stoned\" and ate too much, causing them to fall asleep and not \"get it on.\" Dude, I get that you're in a good mood because the night is almost over, but try to act somewhat professional. For those of you who have read this, I'm not a snob. I'm a normal guy who wanted to take his lady to a nice meal. Unfortunately, I chose Ilios Noche and got Spicoli's cousin for a waiter.",

The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. I see us dining here regularly. Great dining experience!!",

I had the Chicken pita which was good but the chickpea salad that I paired with it was overwhelmingly salty which I thought might have been my own taste buds but my lunch partner also said it was very salty. The upside is the tzatziki sauce. It was the best txatziki sauce I have had ever. All in all it was a good experience with great service and I would eat here again. I may not get the chickpea salad again however.",

The decor is very classy and yet has a rugged cabin feel to it.  It is very cozy!   The food was great.  I tried the pork ribs, and they were good but not as good as I would have imagined.  The slaw and flash fried potatoes that came with the ribs were OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing.  The taste of four appetizer was WOAH, drop your iPhone AMAZING. There was smoked eggplant dip, Greek cucumber dip, hummus, and a tomato based dip with EXCELLENT pita bread.    The waitstaff were VERY knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu.  There were a lot of managers zipping around making sure the guests were well taken care of.  We asked for custom drinks that were not even on the menu, and they were made by the bartender to PERFECTION. The melon vodka martini we asked for was SO fresh.    The bathroom was super clean and well kept.  Seating options are numerous and the almost every space was occupied by happy people enjoying their Greek food.  I would definitely come here again.    Be aware that parking can be difficult, but that was the only issue I could find with my entire experience!!    Happy eating.",

We were immediately seated at a table towards the back, near the very filled wine racks. Sadly, my wife and I aren't wine drinkers but if you are then you'll be pleased. I chose a Catawba draft instead.  The taste of four starter is the way to begin here. Scoops of hummus, tzatziki sauce, red pepper and eggplant with a nice serving of slices whole wheat pitas. Probably too much for two to start with because there was a lot there and we were \"uh, what?\" when our main courses arrived.  My wife chose the lobster ravioli. A very large portion with plenty to bring home, especially after we filled up on the starter. Tasty, creamy, seafoody (is \"seafoody\" a word?) and easy to eat. Delish.  I had the quarter chicken which was served with potatoes and other veggies. A very big portion, there was a lot of flavor and texture in here, with the perfectly al dente potatoes.  Dessert? Well, I guess we can try. We split a piece of baclava which came topped with some sort of (lightly peach-flavored) ice cream/yogurt. Delish.  STUFFED with a delicious meal. We'll be back.",

My favorite for lunch is the chicken caprese panini and either the lemon chicken soup or the ginger carrot soup are absolutely divine.

We each got pasta and the pasta was fresh and the dishes themselves fabulous. I could not finish mine because the portions are huge but Cort ate all of his and wanted more.

Both spots are similar -- I think I like the Providence Rd. one a little better but Quail Corners is closer. Oh, the dilemma! #firstworldproblems  The restaurant was full but handling the crowd well. Service was spot on -- thank you Kyle! I love a restaurant that is attentive but not overbearing. I felt well taken care of but our conversations were never interrupted, we had time to linger over dishes, etc. We also appreciate they use OpenTable for reservations.   Because we had some first timers in the group, our server offered up a few complimentary spreads/dips. We went with the red pepper and eggplant. Both were good; I loved the eggplant. We also ordered olives & almonds and arranchini to start. I had a couple cocktails -- the city of zin and dessert rose. Both were great! Others in the group ordered beers. The beer selection was solid with a wide variety of local drafts and bottles/cans from all over.   I had the side plate for my \"main.\" You can choose 3 sides for $15 -- I went with the risotto, mushrooms and asparagus. All were delicious! The mushrooms were kinda cold but it didn't stop me from stirring them into my risotto for quite the tasty treat. Others in my group ordered panini, spaghetti & meatballs, and chicken parm. Everything looked and smelled SO good.   Overall, great spot serving tasty, fresh Mediterranean flavors in a strip mall. Look past the Harris Teeter next door -- once inside, you'll forget you're not at a stand-alone restaurant.",

Service and ambience a close second.   Waiting to head to the Charlotte Film Festival on a cold and rainy night, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp & decided to give it a go. I was quickly seated on a Friday night at 8p. The menu overwhelms the mind a bit, as it has many traditional Mediterranean centerpieces, a good amount of seafood choices, and a handful of other entrees and sides (such as pizza and lasagna).  I began with the falafel appetizer, and it did not disappoint. 4 perfectly fried balls of goodness, swimming in a shallow pool of some of the best tzatziki sauce I've ingested. I lived in the LA area for 10 years, and this was one of the top 3 falafels I've ever experienced.  As for the entree, I asked my waiter, Daniel, his recommendation, and without hesitation, he suggested the Lamb 'Youvetsi Me Manestra'. It is described as \"slow braised lamb shank, tomato shallot orzo, mizithra cheese.\" Wow. Just, wow. It was very close to a perfect dish. The lamb was tender and fell apart as the mizithra cheese slowly melted into each bite, adding another layer of flavor. Spices were mixed in well, and the perfectly cooked orzo complimented each bite . It was a good sized portion, but I had to finish it. It was one of those meals you didn't want to end.  Do yourself a favor and give Ilios Noche a try. Date night, anniversary, or just after a long week of work, this is the kind of restaurant that deserves to be celebrated.",

My girlfriend had been trying to convince several of us to come here with her for the longest time since she loves it so much. We never made it until recently and I'm wondering why we never came sooner ;)  We usually order a bunch of different plates to share and boy does the food not disappoint! Our usual to order is the angry shrimp, eggplant and zucchini chips, fried calamari, any one of their flat breads and a fish dish or grilled item. Regardless of what you may order, their food is on point! I will be returning sooner than later here :)",

We ordered our coffees/cappucinos which took quite a while.  Then we waited, and waited.   Finally after an hour I told the hostess that we needed to be somewhere since we had already wasted an hour.    At this point there is only 1 other table in the entire restaurant there and I am beginning to see why.   they then brought us the food which was honestly not that great (the other Iliios on providence is much better).    Everything seemed thrown together.  A gentleman came over to ask how our meal was and I told him that we had to wait an hour and that it really wasn't that great.  All he said was that he would look into it.   He never came back to our table, never tried to make anything right, in fact he just disappeared.   So we paid our check and decided this was not worth $50 for really bad service and mediocre food.",

I had the Grecian Pork Ribs with Greek Potatoes and Slaw.   It was delicious.  The Ribs were served piping hot and perhaps the most \"fall off the bone\" that I've ever had.  What really upstaged the ribs were the Greek potatoes ...they were delish.     The Lukomades (for dessert) were incredibly fresh and tasteful!  Nice way to close out the meal.  The place was hopping and had a fine wait staff.   One head waiter...with several people including management rolling by the table to check in and make drop offs from the bar...etc.   They really took care of us without interrupting the flow of conversation at the table.  I would definitely recommend.",

Everything that makes up what a restaurant is - the food, service, ambiance - was top-notch.   FOOD: I started with the Country Greek salad and my husband had the Mesclun salad. I didn't think it was possible to have salad THIS good. The Mesclun salad, especially, was a beautiful explosion of harmonious flavors. Yes, from a salad! For my entree, I had the Crazy Lasagna. Delicious, and never had anything like it before.  SERVICE: The sommelier was our server. I unfortunately do not recall his name, but he was wonderful. Very attentive. When we asked for suggestions on wines to pair with our dessert, he brought out 3 glasses, thoroughly described each of them, and left them for us to enjoy. While having dessert, the general manager came by to say hello and thanks for dining with us.   As a former NYC resident, I've tried a good amount of noteworthy restaurants. Ilios Noche surpassed many of the ones in NYC.   This is the restaurant that has changed the way I now give 5-star ratings.  Can't wait to return to try other items on the menu!",

We had calamari which was excellent (fresh, light breading and MARINARA which is increasingly difficult to get with calamari in Charlotte), the goat cheese in marinara with focaccia was THE BEST appetizer with bread/crackers/focaccia I've ever had (truly amazing goat cheese), and the lamb chops with sliced & fried potatoes were out of this world. Pure heaven.   We also got a free order of fried cheese for my buddy looking like Luke Kuechly and it was excellent as well.  The decor and layout leave a little to be desired IMO, as it seems better suited for the lunch and bar crowd.   Would have gotten 5 stars but the menu is very pricey. $25-$30 for most dinner entrees is \"$$$\" in my checkbook.   With all of the other options in Charlotte for dinner it will probably be some time before I return, but still deserving of four stars.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch today and glad we did.  I had this on my list of places to visit for sometime now but finally made it. I'm President of a HOA in Cornelius and we're getting ready to do some renovations and one of the bidders just finished doing the same type of work less than a mile from here. I volunteered to come down and take some pictures and guess what, accomplished two things today.  As we walked up the door, the hostess on the inside opened the door from my wife and myself and invited us in. Good Start. Then she escorted us to our table and our server showed up a short time later with ice water and menus. We gave our beverage orders and when he returned we had decided on what we wanted for lunch and with this menu with so many choices, it was difficult.  My wife took a chance of ordered Scallops over Risotto. The reason I said took a chance is that she rarely orders Scallops because the tend to be either over cooked and hard and rubbery or under cooked and a bit on the slimy side.  These were perfect and she ate everything on her plate. She's on a diet and rarely eats an entire course. The Mushroom Risotto which was the base for the Scallops was excellent.  I had the Lamb Burger with a side of Fries.  I normally order Lamb cooked medium rare to medium because it's too easy to over cook. This burger came out great. Full of flavor, juicy and a taste treat.  It was accented with Feta Cheese as well. The Fries were not the Shoe String cut we normally get but rather sliced potatoes that were fried and they were delicious.  In the course of lunch, the manager came over and inquired if we were satisfied which is normally the hallmark of a well run restaurant. Good hands on touch by all of the staff.  Good Food, great service and a nice atmosphere and next time, I won't need an excuse to drop in just because I was in the neighborhoo.",

    "text": "Singing: Tomorrow will come but girl I can't wait. It's our anniversary....   my dude and I celebrated our anniversary here. Nothing grand but just as special as the last. We don't get out alone often with a little one as I'm not cool with just anybody watching my baby.   We get in when the lunch crowd is dwindling around 1ish. Cozy seating. Nice setting for lunch or dinner. Outside seating would have been nice in cool yet warm weather.   Our waiter was at the door when we arrived but to our surprise there was a great guy who gave us great advice on the best dishes to choose from the menu.   Kaycee has a catering business and works here part time. His wife is a baker. We got their cards and a good deal should we be in need of their services.   Anyway, the food....  The zucchini chips and tzaziki sauce was really good. They give you so much. Even though you're sharing it's still a lot. So to our surprise because it was our first time there, it was free.   My drink was aight. Hence the reason I can't really remember the name.   My lamb burger and fries were great! Luckily the burger toppings made up for the poorly seasoned meat. I don't believe it had any salt or pepper in it. But it's all good. The lamb was juicy. A crisp buttered bun would have been better.   My dudes food was pretty good. He had some sort of pasta with mushrooms. The flavor worked but I'm not into mushrooms. I don't woogly things in my mouth. Stop it.   The dessert was a miss. The blondie and chocolate cake were both dry as shit. That joint crumbled right before my eyes. I chipped away at it a couple times for a taste. The ice cream is decent. Buuuuut I wouldn't recommend it. It had all the potential to be great, yeeeeeaaaa I stopped at the Teeter and got me some Strawberry ice cream.   Service was excellent. Thanks Kaycee! The food was pretty good.",

    "text": "To start off with, I was really excited to try this place considering my mom had been \"raving\" about how good this restaurant was. The thing is, she went to the Ilios Noche off Providence Road and I didn't think the locations would set apart the service and the cuisine. As I walked in the restaurant, the hostess was really friendly and got us seated in a timely manner. When we got seated it took about at least 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us. She didn't seem busy at all, she had a table closed out on desserts, and another table with two ladies sipping on wine closed out too. I've waitressed before and I currently work in the food industry and I was bothered because I felt like she didn't care about us just due to appearance. I understand you want to get tipped well and the fact that we aren't dressed business casual doesn't mean we won't. Continuing on with dinner, she finally came to the table to take drink orders and appetizers. We had ordered the Ilios Grilled Octopus and Lamb Souvlaki skewers. The appetizers came out fairly fast, but we weren't impressed. The grilled octopus was chewy and dry. It didn't seem like it was fresh at all and the lamb skewers were subpar. About fifteen minutes later, our waitress finally came back to ask us if everything is okay and took our dinner orders. At this point, I was just upset with everything. I honestly wanted to order our food to go, or close out just after eating appetizers. But I really wanted to try the lasagna because that's what my mom told me what was so good about this place. So I ordered the lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the roast pork ribs\". It seemed like after we got our entrees, our server was \"trying\" harder considering all her other tables were gone now and she had more time to focus on us. The lasagna was okay, it wasn't bad but I definitely wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend said his pork ribs were tender and juicy so I'm glad his dish was good. Overall, I would say the food is average. But the service made the experience unbearable. I won't be back and I hope people don't have high expectations for this place because you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "One of the best meals I've had in Charlotte! That is really saying something, as I eat a lot lol.  What a lovely date night spot. Everything was so great!   We began with cocktails. We had the Smokey in the Rye and the Made In. Both were excellent bourbon drinks. The Smokey in the Rye had a smoked glass, which was a nice presentation. The Made In was more like the Manhattan.   Since it was our first time, they gave us a complimentary \"spread.\" Of course I was pumped about that! We chose the roasted red pepper as recommended by our waiter, and it was so good. The pitas were warm and grilled, and I'd like a jar of the peppers to put on just about everything.   For our entrees we got the wild mushroom pizza and the sea scallops over a mushroom risotto. Holy cow both were so good! The pizza had very flavorful cheeze, delicious mushroom, and it was drizzled in truffle oil- my fav!  It was a small size, but very filling. The scallops were perfectly cooked. The mushroom risotto was to die for as well. My fiance' thought it was a bit salty, but I loved it just the way it was. SO GOOD.  Lastly, we splurged and got 4 ice cream tastes. We tried basil, vanilla, and chocolate nutella ice cream. The 4th flavor was apple cider sorbet. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal. The chocolate nutella and the basil are A MUST!  The meal was incredible from start to finish and the waiter was very helpful and attentive. We loved it and we will be back!",

The restaurant has a warm ambiance, and the service staff were friendly and welcoming.  The noise level wasn't bad, so you can have a conversation.  The food OK, nothing for me stood out.  I ordered the scallops which comes with risotto, and I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts. The scallops were cooked perfect and the risotto was good--I just don't think the portion for the price was good.  They forgot the Brussels sprouts, so trying to eat my course slow waiting for the side dish, but ended up finishing before they brought my sprouts--everyone was done with their meals.  Again, the price for the portion, I don't think is very good--nothing really blew me away warranting a second visit.   I think there are better values out there.  I can check this one off as having tried and on to another new restaurant.",

I didn't even know it existed til then.. greeted by the host and served by Sam., who was wonderful.. very attentive and Informative.  We ordered the scallops. I really like it. However, it came with the hummus. And I didn't care for that. The scallops were nicely sear and warm. The hummus wasn't even room temperature. It was frig cool.. it threw me off.  I then order lobster raviolis. It wasn't something memorable where I have to come back for but it was comforting and filling.  The chocolate cake was a failed. I took 2 bites maybe. It was overly dry. It crumbled completely. Wasn't to liking at all.  I would like to come back and try other dishes. Like their drinks menu is pretty cool and the bartender is willing to accommodate you., But I really hope they work on the dessert menu!",

There are 2 locations; we opted to visit the Quail Corners location. We sampled several appetizers to share, we each ordered a main course and we shared 2 desserts. Each and every bite was wonderful! We enjoyed the spinach pie and the Greek meatballs and the grilled octopus was perfectly prepared. Hubby and son enjoyed their chicken parm and lobster ravioli. My grilled bass with gigante beans was just delicious. The fish was perfect, the beans made from scratch and all as tasty as could be. We finish we Greek yogurt panna cotta and the Greek donuts---soooo yummy. Service is excellent and extremely attentive. The owner, Stratos, upon learning we were first timers was as charming and gracious a host I've ever met. Overall, a wonderful experience and a great way to celebrate my birthday! We will be back!",

    "text": "There was more than an hour to kill before the movie.  I asked her 'are you hungry?'.  So I looked up for food around in Yelp and to my surprise, there is a Greek food place within 10 minutes drive from the theatre.  Surprised to find there is a Greek place that we have not even heard of (we love Mediterranean food!!).  The reviews, the pictures of the restaurant pushed us to go ahead and give it a shot. One of THE BEST restaurants for interior decor, obviously I have no idea who the interior decorator is but hats off to that person.  It was a perfect blend of classy and industrial look.  Huge fan of wooden panel walls and those huge light fixtures.   We sat at the bar and our bartender Emily - she is probably one of the main reasons we loved the place and the food.  She was so passionate in explaining their menu and questions that we asked.  Very attentive, responsive, engaging, checking on us periodically.   Food - Complimentary Red roasted peppers spread with pita was damn good (you get couple other options for spread as well).  The spinach pie was such a surprise (at least to us) because this was the first time trying that out and it was delicious.  Emily suggested to have it served with a side of Tzatziki sauce and WOW, that Tzatziki was super fresh and tops all other places I had Tzatziki from.  We just had beers and did not try any cocktails or other drinks. Great place for a classy dinner, family dinners or just hanging out with friends, plenty outdoor seating as well.",

There were three fritattas and some omelet options and of course waffles and pancakes. I was just searching for something more creative.  It was a little heavier on the lunch side than brunch.   I got the chicken and waffle sandwich. I had issues with it and had to send it back. I'm not one for sending food back unless it's just wrong. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and desperately needed some salt.  The waffles were rock hard, you could Crack a tooth on them. I was with a large party and 3 of us hard waffles and we sent them all back. Both times my sandwich didn't have the honey&hot sauce and ligonberry jam on it as described on the menu. When I asked about the jam, no one seemed to know or realized that the jam was supposed to be on the sandwich. And I never did get the honey & hot sauce combo.   The Greek fries were great. I actually paired them with their homemade tzatziki sauce, which I was charged $1 extra for a small ramekin of.   If I come back here, I will try dinner and not brunch. Maybe their dinner dishes are winners. Fingers crossed!",

I ordered the Fig pizza with prosciutto but wish I got the lobster ravioli. It was delicious either way! He got the lamb burger and devoured it. So good.

To finish it all off, a decadent flour-less chocolate torte with a sweet and creamy marshmallow ice-cream. This item wasn't even listed on the dessert menu but my server Noel recommended it.

    "text": "I have dined here twice and  have not been  all that impressed with it. The last time was this past week. They have a new fall menu so I decided to try it again.  I have to give it mixed reviews. We got the appetizer portion of the Greek Style pork ribs with the slaw and cucumber yogurt, which was very good. My friend got a steak that he said was well prepared but disputed whether it was a NY strip as listed, thought it was more like a sirloin steak. I got the butternut risotto which was bland. Typically this dish is prepared by cooking in pureed butternut squash with the Arborio rice which imparts a squash flavor and an orange tint to the dish. Their dish was a basic risotto with cubes of cooked butternut squash stirred in, it would seem after the risotto was cooked, not during. It was white in a appearance with a few lumps of squash. They topped it with some herbs and prosciutto, but overall the dish lacked flavor. Definitely not what I expected.   Service seems to be an issue here. The first time we sat in the bar area and felt that our server was inattentive. This time we were in the main dining area. The server did not seem to have a good command of the new menu; he was not able to give detailed info on some of the dishes we asked about. A  restaurant should make sure all servers have a good knowledge of the menu. And if they don't know a specific question, they should ask the kitchen/management for more info.",

First off I'd like to say that the staff was very attentive and the owner himself came over to say hello. It turns out that his family goes to the same church we do.  The server was very attentive and asked how our meal was and also refilled our soft drinks so the service was not the issue, the food just didn't live up to the expectations we had due to the rave reviews our friends had for the place. It was very disappointing. The pizza had no taste and the crust was burnt on the bottom and it didn't taste like it had baked all the way through. We will try again because maybe the chef had a bad night. This was not a good impression at all.",

    "text": "After reading all of the wonderful reviews, my friend and I decided to try this restaurant.  Our waiter was fantastic but our food and overall experience was not!  We ordered the SUMMER BEETS Salad with macadamia nuts, goat cheese and aged balsamic vinaigrette for $10.00. The beets look liked they were straight out of a can, sprinkled with some very finely grated,  very bland tasting goat cheese, small chips of macadamia and without the balsamic vinaigrette. We both ordered the CAPELLINI sea scallops, with pancetta, white wine, garlic, lemon, broccolini; offered in two sizes. We ordered the smaller portion for $16.00. When we received the Capellini, the pasta portion was adequate but the dish was served with only TWO SCALLOPS!!  They were average sized scallops.  The pasta and scallops were delicious but we were very disappointed that we only received 2 scallops on a plate of pasta for $16.00.  We shared our thoughts on the pasta and the beet salad and he said he would ask the manager to speak with us.  This is were our experience in this restaurant went south in a hurry.  The female manager was rude and condescending! When I began to share our concerns regarding both dishes, she told me that she had personally watched the chef put the balsamic vinaigrette on our salad.  When I showed her that in our dish there was only beet juice (which is red) in the plate and not a hint of the vinaigrette (which is brown) she became very defensive and said that I did not know what I was talking about.  She treated me and my friend like we were two people who did not understand eating in a fine restaurant.  Her resolve to our situation was that she would discuss our concerns with the chef, when he was not busy, and get back to us.  The restaurant was packed and after waiting for 20 to 30 minutes for a response, we paid our bill with a 20% tip for our excellent waiter and we left.   If she had offered us a free dessert, my friend and I might have given this restaurant another try but after our experience, we will not return.  Just be sure if you go to this restaurant, ask a lot of questions about what you are ordering!",

    "text": "We went to here for the first time with another couple who had dined at the other location. I was excited as I love Mediterranean food. The atmosphere is great, the menu fantastic, but that's it. Our server took almost 20 minutes to get our friends' and my husband's cocktails. Mine took another 15 minutes on top of that, and by then, we were almost done with our appetizer (we had the four Mediterranean spreads and they were very good). Our food came out and while the orzo was delicious, after a couple bites, I bit down to find a hard, sharp piece of plastic in my food. We alerted our server (who didn't seem too concerned) and who started to tell me it was probably a piece of plastic wrap from the lamb, until I showed him it was actually hard plastic with a pointy, sharp edge. He asked me if I wanted it re-done, which I did and the manager came over. He apologized and brought me a glass of wine on the house. My re-done meal came out and while the orzo was fantastic, I was disappointed in my lamb shank. It was very fatty and didn't have a ton of flavor. I tried my husband's moussaka, which was great, and my friend's lamb chops were like my lamb, not a strong flavor and kind of bland. Our arugula salad was good, as was the side order of Greek white beans. Come to end of the meal and my friends were charged for an extra cocktail and they didn't take my meal off the bill like the manager had suggested they would. I was very disappointed and we will NOT be returning",

Appetizer came to our table and we had no plates or silverware. Dinner came and I asked for pepper, server could not find any pepper mills. I had to ask another table to get some. When it was time to get the check, they couldn't get that right either. Our server disappeared and I had to find the manager to get our credit cards run. It was one thing after another. We laughed it off, but we will never be back to this location. NEVER.",

But this wasn't the fault of the restaurant but the party that had been there since 5.  When the manager knew how long we were waiting, he arranged for us to be seated right away and got us situated.  We also had a great server who was knowledgeable about the food on the menu. Being a vegetarian I ask every question you can think. He was honest in saying the fries are cooked in the same oil as the calamari so that was a no go. But I totally enjoyed atmosphere and the food. My only issue was the leftovers i had the next day seemed very salted.  I would request that they chef go easy on the sodium so it doesn't taste salty the next day.

They had a James Beard chef visiting and the only special was his Baklava (yum)  Wife got the lamb chops based on the waiter saying they had mint jelly to go with it.  Chops arrived, no mint jelly, they searched and searched, they were out.  Five minutes later they show up with mint jelly, manager had sent someone over to HT next door to buy some for her.  Great Service!!  The only reason not a fifth star is that it was my first time there, need to see consistency to earn that.  We will be back.",

We ordered the calamari appetizer to share. It was a plate of fried rubber rings. Absolutely no taste whatsoever. Very small ramekins of aioli and marinara for dipping since flavor was much needed for this plate. We ordered the chicken piccata and moussaka. The piccata was  ordinarily plain. I was pretty disappointed with the moussaka and so was my friend. We didn't even finish our meals. The only exciting part of our meal was dessert and I do not think that it was made in house. Far too many restaurants to choose from in town and this one is sadly not one of them anymore.",

The olives were very good and pretty unique of a dish. Never seen straight up assorted olives at any other restaurant before. The octopus had good flavor, but the texture was a bit mushy for us. I had the lambchops. It was cooked properly, but lacked seasoning. It was quite bland. One friend ordered a pizza and it was delicious. Another person ordered the seafood pasta. The seafood flavor was embedded in the pasta. That was very well done. The waitress was knowledgeable about her wine which always helps. She was attentive and kept us refilled.

Whenever I have been there on Friday's they have had good live music but on this day it was not scheduled.  I had made a reservation earlier that day and a man had taken down my name and telephone number but upon arrival there was some kind of mix-up and the reservation could not be found.  They did not make a big deal about it and were able to find us a table in about 15 minutes.  The staff was very pleasant although they were very busy with several young people dressed for prom.  Our server was efficient but not overly friendly.    My date ordered the Moussaka and Brussel Sprouts as an appetizer.  I ordered the Seasonal Pasta with Braised Short Ribs and the Chicken Lemon Drop Soup.  The soup was delicious but the Seasonal Pasta was not so good.  The pasta was dry, the short ribs had no flavor and needed some kind of sauce.  I ordered a blackberry Margarita (non alcoholic) and it was delicious.    Although the night was not a shining star for this restaurant but due to the previous superior service, I would say they were overwhelmed and it was likely an off-night for them.  I will try again in the future.",

The focus for Ilios Noche is on a fast & casual restaurant, bar, and bakery dining experience.    I tried the following:  1) \"Greek Style\" Pork Ribs (with coriander, lemon, olive-cabbage slaw, cucumber yogurt) - my manager (from work) ordered this and I got to try some.  Lucky me!  This is definitely a MUST GET item!  The meat was fall off the bones with the perfect amount of seasoning!  2) Braised Short Ribs - I ordered this for dinner as this was marketed as the \"Sunday Daily Special\".  Loved the flavors, but I thought the meat was a tad dry in the center of the meat.  Good size portion.  ENJOY!!",

All recommended dishes by the waitress were coincidently the ones with up-charges... as appetizer we ordered meatballs which were super salty and sent back and the octopus (extra charge) took 35 min to arrive the table. Meatballs were replaced by a serving of calamari that arrived after the main course. Sea bass was decent (also up charge like half of the menu) Chicken Parm was the other dish as main course and probably was fried this morning, because the breading was extremely soggy. Among the desert options, the coconut one I was offered, it was sold out. Got replaced with a mediocre panna cotta which tasted like cardboard met gelatin. It was so frustrating I just wanna leave that place ASAP.  On a side note, the table next to us also had issues and left a horrible tip (clearly visible as they left). Very unfortunate that in such a special day for lots of people, some of us had such terrible experience. It wasn't my first time eating there, but certainly will be the last. Zero start would have been more appropriate.",

    "text": "Luckily for us, Mediterranean restaurants are suddenly plentiful in Charlotte and quite frankly most of them are good to very good, which is also the case with Ilios Noche. This location is by far the more comfortable and visually appealing of its two locations. The dining room is quite stunning and is as beautiful as found any anywhere in the city. The service was courteous and attentive on both the Saturday evenings that we dined there. We unfortunately had issues with the food on both occasions.  We started things off with the Mesclun Salad with baby greens, Gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts, white balsamic vinaigrette. At $8 it is a little pricey; however, it did deliver portion size-wise and was generous with the walnuts and Gorgonzola. The vinaigrette was very tasty but applied too heavily; my mistake however, as I should have ordered it on the side.   I can't go to a Greek restaurant without ordering falafel and that was the case here also. At the very reasonable price of $5, five pieces are served alongside their beautiful tzatziki sauce. As my photo shows, it was artfully displayed however it was a little bland for my taste and was overwhelmed by garlic. This could be chalked up to personal preference but of the eleven area Greek/Mediterranean restaurants that my wife and I have dined over the past year, this falafel was our least favorite.  What cannot be attributed to personal preference however is the two burnt skewers of grossly overcooked tiny lamb kabobs that was served with my Lamb Souvlaki platter. As any Greek chef knows, lamb should be cooked medium rare to medium, yet mine was cooked well done (see photo). I would have normally sent it back but we were running late for church and just didn't have time. The accompanying country Greek salad and Greek fries were excellent. In fact the fries were the best I've had anywhere but such a major mistake on the lamb preparation is hard to overlook and weighs heavily in my overall score. The Pita bread was unspectacular to say the least. (What qualifies Pita bread as spectacular you might ask... see my review for Kabob Je Rotisserie in Matthews, NC for that answer - theirs is out of this world and worth the 10 minute drive.)  On the plus side, the the Wild Mushroom Ravioli at $11 was expertly prepared and very savory. Serving size was small but this was reflected in the price. Loved it so much I was tempted to lick the plate  Overall everything was just okay at best, which is disappointing because, based on prior reviews, our expectations were quite high. Due to the better alternatives I mentioned at the beginning of this review, we probably won't return, but it's still worth a try I think if you haven't been before. I just hope your experience is better than our two visits. The odds, based on other reviews, it probably will be.",

    "text": "Yesterday I had a wonderful lunch at Ilios Noche at Quail Corners. The lunchtime special was tempting (3-course meal for $10), but so was the rest of the menu, and so I ordered from that. I mentioned to the waiter that this was my first visit, and to welcome me he offered me my choice of their 4 spreads, on the house. It was hard to choose, but I selected the melitzanosalata with carrot and celery sticks. He brought a generous portion, and I found the balance of roasted eggplant, walnuts, red onion, and mint very refreshing. I had to make myself leave room for my entree, the Ilios Platter with chicken souvlaki. Glad I did, because it came with 2 generous skewers of well-trimmed, marinated grilled chicken, accompanied by a salad of cucumber, tomato, feta, red onion, and olives in a tasty vinaigrette. There also was a mound of sauteed slices of new potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and herbs, and a large dollop of real tzatziki sauce (no sour cream in sight). Rounding it out was a dish of hot, fresh pita bread. I came hungry (no breakfast), but I still couldn't eat it all. Add to this the great decor and an attentive and personable staff, and I couldn't ask for  better, but I did get more. I ordered a dessert to-go. Much later - in place of supper - I dug into that. It was a scrumptious combination of angel food cake with a fluffy filling, toasted coconut, and passion fruit sorbet. Am I gushing?  Yeah, but it was that good.",

    "text": "I brought my daughter here for a birthday lunch while she was home from college. She loves greek food and I wanted to take her somewhere a little nicer than usual. I had been here before with my husband for our anniversary. The only reason I'm even giving this review two stars is because my daughter was impressed with the ambiance of the place. We had our whole day planned out starting with lunch but it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. Shortly after, we placed our food order. We ordered an olive appetizer and we both ordered the lamb souvlaki with greek fries and ilios salad. I wanted to ask the server for something to accompany the olives as we only had toothpicks and olives but we didn't see her again for another 10 minutes. We just decided to save them for our meal. We were both in need of refills shortly after getting our meals and I needed salt for my lamb but we could not get our server's attention. She passed by our table several times without stopping so I finally gave up and used the sauce from my salad because I didn't want to to waste it. The server came and asked about refills at the point when I was ready to ask for the check. I paid the check and didn't get a thank you, have a nice day, happy birthday, nothing. Maybe she was having a bad day. I don't know the reason but what was supposed to be a nice quick lunch turned into a 2 hour ordeal. I was so frustrated that this was not the experience I wanted to give my daughter for her birthday. Originally we were going to go for her birthday dinner but I'm glad I took her alone for lunch instead of taking several guests with us.",

A little attention to sound absorption would make it more pleasant - we found that the conversation from the table next to us was reverberating off the wall right into our space.  (There was live music, but it wasn't intrusive - it was nice.  The problem was the overall clatter and din.)    Second thing is wait-staff that rolls in and verbally tramples whatever you were in the middle of saying.  The interruptions got really annoying after the first 20-30 times.  A simple 1-second delay would create the attention they need to do their jobs well.",

We are so thrilled to have such a top notch restaurant right in our neighborhood shopping center.  The decor is rustic elegant and the place has a great vibe.  They had live music the night we were there and the bar was packed--even on a Wed. night! Our meal was one of the best I've had in Charlotte.  The lamb shank should not be missed if you like lamb.  It's the most tender I've ever had.  The wait staff is professional, attentive and excellent--- a real plus for me because I feel service in Charlotte is just ok overall.  Ilios Noche servers are definitely a cut above.  I recommend this for a casual lunch/dinner with friends/family or a special occasion dinner or lunch.

    "text": "Let me first say that it is so nice to see new diversity in dining at Quail Corners.. I've lived in the area on and off for over 22 years and to see the place get a face lift after that long, and new shops is a very welcome change.  After an afternoon shopping with my mother, we decided to eat here for a rather late dinner, around 9:00. Knowing that many dining establishments in the area close around that time, our hopes were feeble in finding a good meal at this hour. Fortunately, Ilios Noche doesn't close until 10:30 on Saturdays, and we were welcomed by the hosts with a smile. We were seated rather quickly, after a ten minute wait. Our server was immediately attentive, but left us feeling a little rushed to decide what we wanted to eat. Having never been here before, I asked her for a few recommendations and a few more minutes to decide.  While reading the rest of the menu options, we ordered a round of local beers (they offer several) and  the taste of four spreads to start our meal. They included a roasted eggplant spread (similar to babaganoush), hummus, red pepper spread, and tzatziki, served with warm pita bread. We all decided that the eggplant and tzatziki were our favorites. For main course, I ordered the chicken limonata- a half roasted chicken, baby potatoes, artichoke hearts served in pan jus. My mother ordered a pasta dish with chicken and spinach in a tomato cream sauce, and my father the crazy lasagna. I was hoping my chicken limonata would have been closer to a Grecian-style lemon chicken , but I think serving it in pan jus was Ilios' spin on that traditional flavor. Potatoes and artichokes were tender, and complimented the chicken well. Mom's pasta was tasty, but I think dad's crazy lasagna wins. The best part of their dishes were the portion size- they ordered the half size, and still had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.  We debated deserts after seeing what the table next to ours had ordered- some sort of chocolate torte, but decided that would be saved for another time. The baklava and pistachio ice cream just beckons my taste buds. All of their deserts are made in house by their pastry chef (who is of Mediterranean descent). Authentic, to say the least, and I'm sure they are all delicious.   I'll be back for sure.",

I went there with a friend last night and we shared a few dishes including the goat cheese stuffed peppers, the cheese pies, the dip sampler, and calamari.  Everything was delicious! The stuffed peppers were a sweet pickled pepper of some sort like a piquillo, they had been charred lightly on the grill before being stuffed with goat cheese and drizzled with olive oil and fresh dill which really enhanced the flavor and texture.  The calamari was a generous portion, had a delicious light and crispy batter and was a mixture of rings and tiny squid. Some kalamata olives were mixed in which i loved. It was served with a lemon aioli and an incredibly delicious and savory marina sauce that made me want to try their pasta.  Each of the four dips we tried (smoked eggplant, tsatziki, roasted red pepper, and hummus) were very tasty and balanced each other out well.  The standout were the cheese pies - they were decadent, buttery, flaky and delicious. The cheese was a mixture of some sort that must have included something sharp and salty like feta or Parmesan.  The service was very attentive and friendly and it looked like they had great drink specials for happy hour. Pricing was also pretty reasonable. I would highly recommend it as a low key place in south Charlotte to enjoy some excellent Mediterranean tapas.",

When I heard they had a special event dinner (that we sadly missed) partnered with my favorite restaurant from Atlanta, Kyma, we finally decided to make the trek to give them a try.  First off, we used to love the mezze plates from Kyma.  Ilios Noche has a similar format, with all of our favorites offered as small plates.  We decided to just pick two, and get two entrees.  We had the angry shrimp, which were perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce.  Next, we had their octopus.  This was probably the best octopus we've had yet.  It was fork-tender, marinated in a nice red vinaigrette, and served with pickled red onions.    For our entrees, I debated between the scallops with capellini and the scallops with mushroom risotto.  The server recommended the risotto, so I went with that.  The scallops were large but not jumbo, and I got five of them.  The risotto was cooked well, but it had a bit too much of a Parmesan bite for my liking.  My husband had the braised lamb with orzo.  The lamb was fork-tender, and the orzo was mixed with a sauce that was deliciously complex, yet very light.    We had a mule and their Aphrodite beverages.  Both were good, but I think my Aphrodite was a bit weak.   We enjoyed our food, and think Ilios Noche has some of the better Greek food in CLT.  If Ilios Noche were closer to us in Lake Norman, we'd probably be regulars.  Sadly, they are too far to visit other than every once in awhile.",

For the entree I ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti the chicken was cooked perfect pounded out thin and had a good amount of sauce. The service was great. The owner Stratos  takes great care to make sure every customer's needs are met. This is a place I would visit",

We sat at the bar and that seemed to be a popular pick for a Saturday night but not too busy.",

The hostess seated us quickly an our waitress came to get our drink order very quickly. Service was awesome, we ordered some appetizers to start with the zucchini chips with Dill sauce , olives and the cream pies.  The zucchini chips with dill sauce huge order of them an lightly fried very crispy an I love dill the sauce did not disappoint.  The olives were good what you would expect. Those cream pies so good it comes with 3 its a flaky crust almost like phyllo dough. Filled with a cream cheese base an spices. For dinner I ordered the chicken lemonata its baby potatoes, artichokes, broccolini , red onions greek olives an lemon dressing.  Now here is where I was disappointed I love lemon an this sounded like an amazing dish.   My chicken was good moist an potatoes an artichokes but No lemon flavor at all:(  My friend ordered the chicken  skewers she said they were just okay.  My other friend ordered the salmon salad she said it was good but nothing great we all agreed this is a great place for drinks an appetizers but dinner for us was not good. If your in the area stop in the appetizers were very good an great selection of wines.",

    "text": "So I've been here a few times over the years and somehow never wrote a review. During that time the quality has stayed very consistent. If you like lamb burgers, they have a really good one here and I also highly recommend the platter that has all four of their spreads/dips. The hummus here is killer - very lemony (which I love) and has a nice grainy, in a sense \"al dente\" texture (not overly processed).  Took the family out for a quick early dinner. The Country Style Greek salad has no lettuce but instead has a base of tomatoes and cucumbers. It's really delicious - they do an excellent job of making sure the tomatoes are tasty and high quality to really establish the dish - top it with a chunk of Feta and you've got a good one! My picture of the pizza doesn't do it justice. They're cooked fresh to order and brought to the table hot - crispy and loaded with cheese.  My eye went to the awesome choice of sides. I had such a hard time deciding that I made a meal of them: Brocollini with lemon, Rich creamy Risotto Parmigiano and White Tuscan beans. The Tuscan Beans are just brilliant! They have a tomato herb vinaigrette on them which makes them extremely addictive. My wife, who doesn't like beans kept stealing them from my plate.  Great service - a few local craft beers - bottled Greek beer, should you be in the mood, and consistently good food.",

I will start by saying that they recovered beautifully and Care deeply about their product, people and reputation. As you can imagine it was a very busy night and unfortunately we had a new waitress that was a bit overwhelmed. Getting drinks out quickly and getting the bills straight proved to be a bit hectic and aggravating. With that said, the owner jumped right in to help out and did just that. He was professional and did exactly what he needed to do in order to turn this review around.  The food was an absolute 10, as always. I will say that the music, as provided by the DJ, was not appropriate for the croud that was there. V. I. P. and Sean Paul are not remotely appropriate or pleasurable to listen to while trying to enjoy your dinner. Listen to any of their songs and ask yourself if this is relaxing or dinner music.  This place draws a demographic that, if polled, would agree.  The Latin Dancers they brought in were fantastic and really livened the place up to introduce the new year.   I am a fan of the two restaurants they have and go to both and will continue to do so. I recommend.",

Located in Charlotte, NC in a shopping center the decor of this place was amazing! The shiplap walls created a cozy ambiance with a classy twist. When we arrived, a local artist performed cover songs on the acoustic guitar by the bar. I'm not sure if they have live music often but it was a treat to jam out to 90's rock.   For appetizers we ordered grilled octopus and angry shrimp. Both were delicious but I enjoyed the grilled octopus more! It had the smoky taste but also very flavorful. They give you a basket of bread and it comes out fresh! For my entree I ordered the lobster ravioli and the pasta and sauce were made to perfection. The lobster meat was the perfect amount! My sister ordered the crazy lasagna and the amount of cheese was crazy alright! It's one of their popular dishes that came out in a skillet but sadly I was too full to take a bite.     By the end of it all, we were all too full to eat the desserts so I didn't get a chance to glance at the menu and try any. Our server Nadia was so attentive and pleasant! My sister and brother in-law always request her and I completely understand why. I highly recommend this place if you're ever stuck craving both types of food.",

    "text": "Thanks to this restaurant, had a worst Valentine's dinner ever. We ordered taste of spread(4 of them), calamari fritti for appetizers. Sea scallops and striped bass for main dishes. Everything was good until the first appetizer, spread was served. Then the server told us that the sea scallops ran out of so we had to order something else. Okay, we changed the order to slow braised lamb shank. In about 20mins, the server came again and told us striped bass ran out of as well.   What? Either the server didn't order it so we missed the last dish or the kitchen staffs don't know what they are doing. We just let it go. Then he served lamb shank before they even serve the calamari! We asked about calamari and he said it was ready. Then another 20mins passed. We already lost our appetite!   Even though there was a manager walking around but he didn't seem to know what is going on. There is a big management problem with this restaurant. I checked the other reviews and they also mentioned about bad service and management.  The food? The spread was okay like the most of greek restaurants. The lamb was under my expectation. It was not as tender as I expected. (Trying to be fair for food review despite of bad service)   I think their food is average and maybe some of dishes can be more than that. If you are lucky, you don't experience this worst service and can enjoy your food. Otherwise, you only get served two dishes other than four dishes you ordered.  Good luck!",

We didn't order any drinks, but their drink menu looks really good and I may give one a try next time! For an appetizer, we ordered calamari, which in my opinion was very under-fried. The breading was very light colored, but the sauces that accompanied it were very flavorful. For dinner, neither of us could decide so we shared the salmon with broccolini and the lobster ravioli. Both were really great, but the salmon was especially outstanding. The relish on top, and the sauce underneath, perfectly complimented the crisped, medium done salmon. Would definitely order that again.",

Those would be the marinated grilled octopus appetizer, and the lip smacking lamb burger. The octopus is amazingly tender and grilled to a wonderful char. The half pound lamb burger is cooked from rare to well done, however you wish, and topped with feta, tzatziki, grilled onions,  and roasted red peppers...Absolutely delicious. The look of the place is upscale but comfortable, the service has always been attentive, And I can think of no reason you wouldn't enjoy a visit to this great restaurant tucked into the corner of Quail Corners Shopping Center.",

Always had to ask them to get service.  My braised lamb shank meat was slightly dry. Reheating this product is tricky and one succeeds only if the shank is not overcooked in the first place. And the orzo had no discernible flavor either. But the lamb jus that was served in the bowl brought the dish together.  Pita or some other bread would have been a favorable addition.  Still, I'll continue to frequent Ilios since most of my other meals have been 4 stars!",

My family and I came in for our weekly Takeout Tuesday meal so we were not properly dressed. But none the less we went inside and was promptly seated. The ambience is beautiful and they have outdoor seating. This is a wonderful place for date night and in my opinion not for a random evening out with the family. See we like to play games at the table since we have a no phone policy while out(sometimes we slip up). Getting back to the food!!!! Amazing!!!! It needed up being a great night out despite my apprehension. Our Server was prompt and very attentive. There's also tv's if you sit at the bar. I can't say how the drinks were because it was a water night for me. Will definitely try this place again sans children",

    "text": "I'm not an epicurean. I'm an old fart and a fussy eater. But I'm not so far gone that I don't recognize quality when I see it.  Ilios Noche has it.   There hasn't been a decent place to eat in my Quail Corners neighborhood since I moved here 14 years ago. Mama Riccota's, a Chinese Place, Wolfman Pizza . . . all gone (Wolfman moved and downsized from a sports bar to a Little League Pizza place.)  They starved to death. Based on that history, I figured we could perambulate over to the new Ilios Noche on a Friday before sundown without reservations and have our choice of seating. That was not in the cards. The place was packed and the only seating was on stools at a lunch counter against the wall.  Hardly enough room for a sandwich. Not nearly enough for a full meal.  Up steps Alex Mourias, the general manager. Our genial host takes my wife by the arm and steers us to the bar, scooting several patrons down a bit to make room.   The leftmost seats at the bar are by the wait station where drinks are ordered and received. If our bartender is not in charge, she should be. She worked that bar with non-stop energy and diligence the entire time we were there. It was a pleasure to watch her multitask; mixing, taking orders, instructing, and having a running conversation with us and everyone else. Not the least of her skills was mixing my wife a flawless Martini (which should have printed instructions in several languages -- It's seldom correct.) I'll see if I can find her name and append it here later. She is deserving of our praise.  The rest of the wait staff were all friendly and eager to help. At least a good half dozen people cheerfully helped us -- without us needing to flag someone down! (Granted we were sitting in the center of activity, but still!)  The Food.   My wife reports that the shrimp and sauteed mushrooms were absolutely scrumptious. My own dinner was the spaghetti and meatballs. Three generous meatballs were flavorful and good. the spaghetti with a marinera sauce was perfectly seasoned.  I wish I could eat more, so I could give a report on more items, but I'm picky, remember? Subsequent visits will provide me more to write about. There are several lamb dishes on the menu I'm eager to try.  We've found a place just blocks from home! We're going to be regulars.",

While our food was good, we weren't overly impressed.  We started with the grilled octopus, which was by far the best dish we had all night.  For our main dish, I had the lamb shank and my husband had the marsala pasta.  My lamb shank was sans shank, which is a little weird since all the flavor comes from the bone.  My husband's pasta was bland and mainly made up of pasta, not a lot of meat or veggies.  Even my son didn't care for his mushroom pizza.  The bar seemed to be out of every beer & wine I ordered even though it was Saturday night and on the menu.  Overall, not impressed, and felt that we would have been better just ordering appetizers and salads.  If you want real Mediterranean food, then there a lot of other truly authentic restaurants around town.",

When I asked the waitress what it was, she said it was a blondie brownie. It was hard as a rock. I couldn't even get my fork through it. The cake was cold and tasted like something that was bought in a convenience store. The ice cream had no taste. I cannot imagine a restaurant serving this. Our service was very slow and impersonal.

First off the staff is very professional.....very young but very professional. They did make a few execution errors (like couldn't fine the right table throughout the night) but hey, that didn't detract one bit from the awsome meal we had.  First off we started with their Burrata mozzarella...which, for those of you unfamiliar with this unctuous dish, is a mozzarella cheese stuffed with cream and milk. It's outrageously delicious! They served this app with fresh heirloom tomatoes and a balsamic glaze. Oh so yummy!  Then my date got the Veal Chop and I got the Scallop special. OMG were both awesome! She got the Veal Chop done Med Rare and the outside was perfectly seared while the inside velvety soft. This was served over a bed of sauteed mushrooms which my date didn't care for (it's a female-texture thing....) but I gladly wolfed down!  I got the Scallop special, servered over an eggplant puree. The scallops were perfectly done, and seasoned to perfection. We both agreed that this dish was one of the best each of us has had in months!  Then for the finale.....we got their signature BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE and PISTACHIO TORTA, topped with passion fruit sorbet, made by their Pastry Chef, Frank Kaltsounis. Let me tell you....I'm somewhat of a dessert snob/harsh critic but I couldn't find one flaw in this dessert! It was PERFECTION! They somehow got 2 layers of chocolate moose over a pistachio crust, and topped it with a Mango puree! It should not work but it was AMAZING! Anyone reading this review needs to go there and try it and let me know what you think! It was I believe the best dessert I've had in my 3.5 years in Charlotte, and I've had a LOT of desserts!  We ordered WAYYYYY to much wine which drove the bill much higher than I would have liked. BUT, they DO have a fabulous wine list.....just don't order the 8 glasses like we did and you're bill will be reasonable. But that was our fault....a \"fault\" I could live with.   Our waitress Alyssa was a doll, and superbly nice. The Manager came by and chatted with us, making sure we were happy and also was very professional and cordial.  Overall, this was an extraordinary meal! It's right up there with Good Food, Carpe Diem and Soul. This is a MUST TRY restaurant! Way to go Ilios Noche Quail Co!",

I am definitely looking forward to my next visit here. A little pricey but the quality is on par with the price.  We started with the Roasted Red Pepper 'Htipiti': barrel-aged feta, chili pepper, arbequina olive oil. Awesome spread to begin the meal.  Then we split the LAMB 'Youvetsi Me Manestra' slow braised lamb shank, tomato shallot orzo, mizithra cheese.   And the PAN ROASTED CORVINA greek risotto cake, grilled ratatouille vegetables, aged balsamic. Hard to say which one was better both blasting with flavor the lamb was so tender and the corvina was moist.  Next time you're in the mood for some Mediterranean can't go wrong here.",

I was offered pita bread with it, but ate it alone.  It was great.  They pan fry it so it's nice and crispy but not too greasy.  Then I had the lamb burger with the chick pea salad.   I debated what temperature to get the burger.  I'm a medium rare steak but medium well burger kind of person so i went with medium for this.  The lamb was juicy and not gamey like lamb can sometimes be.  The chick pea salad was a great complement and wasn't too salty or oily like those salads can be with prepared dressings.    Service was great, but i was there off peak.",

I was a little intrigued to see if the staff treated us weirdly since we weren't regulars, but all was well!  The place was hopping with live music happening in the bar, and we bellied right up. The bartender was pleasant and fast, and my most favorite part was that they had hooks under the bar for purses!  The fella and I moseyed over to the restaurant side for dinner, and our waiter was so sweet! We ordered hummus to start out with ($3.50), and it came with pita points that looked maybe like they were pumpernickel? Pretty tasty. For dinner, the fella got the lamb burger ($13.50), and I got the grapes and fennel salad with grilled chicken ($12.50). The fella said the lamb burger was even better than The Liberty's, which is high praise indeed. I can attest to the Greek fries being awesome - they were more like thick slices of potatoes with olive oil and feta cheese. YUM. The salad was delicious, too.  Overall, a solid addition to Quail Corners and a seriously under served part of south Charlotte!",

Maybe they were overwhelmed on a Saturday night but we sat for 20 minutes without one person coming to the table to tell us sorry we are so busy but a waitress will get to you at some point.  Took about 30 min total from the time we sat (we had reservations) to the time we got drinks and someone took our order. Hostesses could also use some customer service training.

They are located in the corner of the Quail Corners Shopping Center closest to Park Road.  So, the other day on the way back to the office from a client meeting, I decided to pop in to have a bite of lunch.    The layout and decor looks very much like the renovated original location, and the menu is pretty much the same as well.  Which is good, because I love the offerings there.  It was tough deciding between the pasta dishes, sandwiches, and salads. Ultimately, I decided to go with one of my favorites - the fig, grape, and fennel salad with grilled chicken added to it.     The service was very good at this location on my visit.  If you have not yet tried ilios noche, you definitely should go check out their delicious offerings.  Some of my favorite starters include the hummus, sea scallops, and the cheese plate.  As for the dinner entrees, any of the wood-oven specialties are good.  Pizzas are good here as well.",

We saw the manager seat another couple of two before us, even though they checked in after us (which I know because this same couple tried to cut us while waiting in line to check in). After we seated ourselves in the bar area, the manager did come over, quickly slung down an appetizer while mumbling \"sorry for the wait\", and  then quickly ran off without even making eye contact with us. No reasoning as to why they kept us waiting for an hour, or why he sat another couple before us. That's not how you treat customers. I will never go back, nor will I recommend to friends.",

I went last week for a birthday dinner and we had a server who was not the best. Mind you, 5 of the 8 people have been in the service industry so we're pretty lenient with our judgment of service because 'we know how it is'. He didn't show very much personality and took long to get us drinks, desserts, and checks. He definitely could have been nicer and more attentive.",

    "text": "This place is a great dinner spot for south Charlotte without driving towards the city. They have quite a large menu with choices from traditional Greek dishes to other dishes with Greek touches (pizzas, pastas). I had one of the pasta dishes which tasted great and everyone else in my group wanted to try.   The decor of the place is very stylish. Rustic but very classy and updated. Think Restoration Hardware. Great setting to have cocktails, which were very well made also.  The one tough part is parking. The lot fills up very quickly at dinner time and we had to park by Harris Teeter. Consider making a reservation for peak times- the waiting area was quite crowded but we didn't have to wait having made one.",

The staff is awesome and knowledgeable about the food which is great if your new to Mediterranean food. This place happens to be close to my house and is always on our short-list of restaurants for dinner. This is the type of place you can go to and you will be in love with the first thing you try (the lamb burger for me) and you will not want to order a different item the second time which a True dilemma because the other items I promise you are delicious as well.",

They were out of too many things for an 8pm dinner on a Friday; from fresh bread to wine glasses and a bunch of specials and sides! The servers seemed frazzled and tired, and it wasn't until we made a comment about the poor service did we even get napkins on our table... Sigh! The ambiance was still wonderful - 5 stars for that, the food was mediocre at best - our bread was stale, the eggplant and zucchini chips were okay, the funghi pizza was a little dry and our corvina unfortunately smelled quite fishy. The service was not so great - perhaps just growing pains from the new found popularity? We did get good wine recommendations from the bar manager, so plus points for that. On a less busy day I'm certain the experience would you much better.",

    "text": "When I saw they offer grilled octopus, it was a done deal. I made RSVP for dinner on Friday (to beat the romantic V-Day crowd) at 7:45pm. As most have already mentioned, it is well decorated with a nice ambiance, making it a good date spot in the SouthPark area that won't 100% break your bank. I do think that some of their 2-tops are quite closely put to one another - it was quite easy to be distracted by the neighboring conversation (and also the lack of space to put personal items such as bulky winter jackets).  We arrived slightly behind schedule, the hostess actually phoned me as we were 5 mins away. I appreciate the fact that they didn't just give our reservation away. Our waitress was quick to greet me while BF was still parking, yet she did not re-greet us for awhile once he arrived (and I could see her not occupied by other tables). Overall I think the service had room for improvement.   I ordered the grilled octopus ($13) as my appetizer and it was absolutely divine. It came sliced, and it was a good amount to be shared (or in my case, I ate it all myself!). Perfectly cooked, every piece was tender and tasty. I highly recommend the octopus (and it's a much healthier alternative to the fried calamari)!   For dinner, BF went with the Margharita pizza, which for $9 was a very big portion. Definitely enough to be an entree. I opt for the full size Capellini ($20) once I confirmed that the sea scallops are served whole (they offer half size option for most pasta dishes - but for $4 more I figured I could save half for a 2nd meal). The scallops turned out to be quite sizable - 4 of them, sitting on the pasta. I don't think this dish could ever be \"pretty\" but I care most about the taste. Thus imagine my disappointment when I was overcome by the blandness of everything. The pasta tasted like nothing, even the scallops were bland. How on earth something with so much butter, garlic and pancetta tasted so blah was beyond me! I even asked for shaved parm (since we were never offered any) to see if that would help with the taste - but the 100% lack of sodium wasn't something easily fixable.   I was this close to surrender, I thought I would just pack my entire dinner home so I could redo it myself at home. My BF hates to complain in restaurants and was scared to death by the possibility  that I would make a scene (men... I swear). But I ended up speaking up when waitress came by to check on us. She insisted for it to be recooked. Manager Jodi followed up as well, and promised the dish will be tasty.   Take 2 was definitely a great improvement. I hope the kitchen could agree that I wasn't being crazy but I think someone forgot to put salt in the 1st one. I enjoyed my dish and thought it was of decent value. I do, however, wish my waitress remembered to bring me cheese (if I asked for cheese the first time, I thought it's reasonable for her to bring cheese the 2nd time, or at least ask if I still wanted any cheese).   In the end I think it was a solid dinner - the food ended up being great. The service was average, they could be more mindful about the little things like offering fresh pepper/cheese (and we never had bread... I read that bread was offered in other reviews). I will revisit, if anything just to have the octopus again.",

They had to know on Valentine's Day they would fill more tables- any good restaurant would be ready for this. It's understandable maybe. Order 2nd choice sea bass with two appetizers (4 taste of spreads and  calamiri ) wife orders lamb. After getting the 1st appetizer which took 15 mins the server comes out and tells us they ran out of sea bass. From my experience if the server puts the ticket in the kitchen tells them the are out. My thoughts he checks all his tables first before he puts his orders in. Wife's lamb comes out-  Ask when the 2nd appetizer is coming out? He goes to the kitchen and tells us it's almost ready. 15 more mins pass and he brings it out- at this point I'm ready to end the worst restaurant experience  I've ever had. Tell him I don't want the appetizer- he tells me it's on the house. I don't eat out to complain and get free stuff. I just expect to get my meal on a timely manner and would gladly pay for this. Summary $55 for 1 appetizer 1 beer and 1 lamb dish",

I chose Risotto(cooked to perfection), red quinoa salad with sliced almond(incredible) and chick pea fries that were very light and tasty.  Awesome time!  Awesome place!

It took 25 minutes to get drinks. 15 min of sitting without one word from anyone welcoming us or letting us know a waitress was coming.   Also when we called to reserve they said it was no problem to sit outside then when we showed  the hostess said well \"that's not my fault I did not tell you that. did you get the name of the person you talked to\". A simple I am sorry for the confusion but we don't reserve outside would have been much more appropriate.  So the review started at 2 stars. I moved it to 3 stars because the food was good and the manager came over to check in us and quickly fixed a salad our Vegan daughter ordered which came with cheese on top. He got her a new salad very quickly.  I would come back here again and I think they just need some changes in service on a. Busy night.",
