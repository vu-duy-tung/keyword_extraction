The service was pretty quick and friendly, and the pizza I ordered (the can make one with gluten-free crust) was quite tasty. Hope to try one of their salads next time. Was also nice too when I went to take my plate to the trash, a manager went ahead and did so for me. Great little place (and many steps above the Sbarro that used to be there).",

    "text": "My first time at this place, I always walk by it hoping to try it out soon. I was in the mood for their salads and I ordered the chopped salad and replaced the bacon with chicken and had italian dressing. I did not get a combo or any add ons, and they were going to charge me for extra dressing and for chicken? The chicken was to replace the bacon, not add to it. The cashier did apologize and remove the extras. The customer service was good, but then when I opened my salad there was basically a pound of chicken on my salad so I took 3/4th's of it off and started to eat my salad. I only took 5 bites and threw the rest away. Every time I took a bite, there was this terrible taste, I'm not sure if something wasn't seasoned right, or something was old, but, I was pretty disappointed that I wasted $9 on a salad I didn't even enjoy. I hear the pizzas are good, but my salad selection I don't really recommend.",

    "text": "Fourth time at Maddio's and still loving it!  Everything is fresh and the staff members are very pleasant.  Although the line is long and can seem intimidating, it goes by pretty quick.  Total time is about 10-12 minutes.  Not bad for great and fresh pizza!  At Maddio's you don't have to wonder how long the pies have been sitting on the counter or how many times it's been warmed up! It's made fresh every time.    Other positive notes: - The pesto sauce (instead of traditional tomato sauce) is amazing! I love the option of different sauces.  There's something for everyone.   - A woman behind me ordered a gluten-free pizza so the dough handler made sure he changed his gloves before handling her pizza! Very considerate of cross-contamination for gluten sensitive customers.  - Crispy thin crust that holds up with every bite.   And as always, it's \"made with lots of love\"!",

They have a good selection of pre-selected pizzas like BBQ chicken, or you can make your own.   The staff is consistently friendly. Which is good because you will interact with 3 or 4 staff members as you proceed through the line.   Another thing I like about Uncle Maddio's is their rewards system. Believe it is buy 10 get 1 free - but don't quote me!  No card is needed as you can use your phone number to look it up at the register (similar to Harris Teeter).  Finally, if you are dining in the store, the decor is fairly modern. And there is a selection of both booth seating and regular tables.",

    "text": "A star among the otherwise limited options available in the Overstreet Mall, Uncle Maddio's serves delicious pizza, at a decent price, quickly and with a smile.  Pizzas, sandwiches and salads are made to order right out in front of customers so you can see everything that's going on. Maddios uses a modern conveyor style oven for their pizzas, so once yours is on the belt it's probably 8-10 minutes before it's coming out, piping hot and then straight to you.  I tried the Steak & Blue pizza on my first visit, and it was so delicious I haven't been able to convince myself to order anything different on subsequent visits. You have a choice of white, wheat or gluten free crusts. Some people might get a little nervous about Blue Cheese on a pizza, but it's not overpowering and the balsamic glaze drizzled on after the pizza comes out of the oven creates a perfect flavor profile.  The line forms quickly at lunch, and for good reason. From my desk in a nearby office building to Maddios and back with my carryout order it takes roughly 20 or so minutes, which gives me plenty of time to enjoy my pizza before my next meeting.  The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient. They move fast and they have smiles on their faces. I've never seen a sullen person working at Uncle Maddios.   The only downside is that the restaurant gets very crowded and there is almost never a table available, but I can't really fault the restaurant for being so popular.",

Maddio's is packed during lunch hours.  I tried their eggplant parmesan panini.  The format of the restaurant is fast casual, workers in front adding ingredients along an assmbly line with an oven behind them.  Pros:  -For baked food like pizzas/paninis, this place is fast. -Prices are reasonable and the food tasted fresh. -For such heavy food, there was almost no carb crash or food coma when I returned to the desk.  Cons:   -Crowded at lunchtime.  This is to be expected as all the nearby overstreet mall competition are chains like Salsaritas, Mcdonalds, and Chick Fil A.",

I did a wheat crust (also has regular and gluten free), then got to pick my own sauce and toppings.  Price isn't too bad for a personal pizza made fresh for lunch.  Could use some more seating to the intense lunch rush, but other than that I didn't have anything negative to say about it.

I'd been avoiding it due to long lines and limited lunch time, but took a risk with a friend and I'm glad I did.   The format allows you to customize your own personal pizza. Their menu offers a variety of pizza suggestions/options with a selection of crusts. I went with the basic white crust, topped with a good tomato sauce, cheese, meatballs, mushrooms and banana peppers. I could have selected from a large variety of toppings. Next time, I'm definitely trying the eggplant - it looked excellent. I was pleasantly surprised to discover their claim of 6 minutes from order to table was accurate. I love thin crust pizzas, and this had a nice, crispy thin crust.   My friend ordered the chicken salad salad (she'd been there the day before for pizza). The salad was a generous size and had lots of tasty stuff in it. The chicken salad had big chunks of chicken in a nicely herbacious dressing.

Realized I had waited for over 20 minutes when some kind of veggie with mayo pizza is brought out to me. I return to the register where I explain what I had ordered and the girl turns and shouts \"Here's the Spicy!\". Another worker grabs a box from on top of the oven (No longer hot) and switches it with mine. But wait - This one has banana peppers, not even the one I watched being prepared. They now want to remake a pizza for me. I opted for a refund and ended up with a quick Big Mac in order to make it back to my office for a meeting. I understand mistakes, but the situation was handled so very nonchalantly.No doubt the food is (smelled) good and I may try it again but I'll keep a closer eye on them to thwart a screw-up.  UPDATE - I gave them a second and third try and both times they were spot-on. The ingredients are balanced out nicely with a nice, crisp crust. I did try the eggplant on my last visit and wonder why they wouldn't warm it up if not make it fresh? It was rather soggy so I'd pass on that. Otherwise, worth a visit.",

Pizzas are delicious, and you watch them make it so you know it's freak and everything is clean! They also have great breakfast calzones, but they are a little messy. Two thumbs up for this pizza joint!",

I think it replaced the bagel place, but I'm not too sure without doing some more research... the fact that I can't remember what was in place before probably says a lot.  I only got a salad, but the places concept really intrigued me... personal pizza made right in front of you.    Went during the tail end of the lunch rush so there wasn't much of a line, but you could tell the workers were just \"bouncing\" back from a busy busy period.  They were still friendly and I was surprised how much chicken I received in my Santa Fe Salad.  The house made, chipotle ranch dressing was pretty darn good - had the right amount of kick and they put it in containers so I had some control over how much dressing went on my salad.  Will have to come back and try their pizza, but their salad is definitely a solid lunch option for me and I will be back!",

    "text": "For a lunch spot, Uncle Maddio's hits the spot.  It is a great place for fast and decent pizza that is made in front of you as you walk down a line selecting your ingredients (think Subway subs ordering process).  Atmosphere - Loud, busy, small...fast casual.  Service - I have been here twice and the service has always been fast and friendly, despite the Uptown lunch rush.  Yes, on one visit I did notice the employees get someone's order wrong and it took some effort to get it resolved...but hey...it wasn't mine...ha!  Food - There are a lot of options here at Maddio's when ordering your custom made personal pizza pie.    Dough: First, you've got to select your dough.  I have had both the original dough (see pic) and the wheat dough (never tried the Gluten Free).  Based on my experience...get the wheat dough.  The original dough was too chewy and tough (i.e. leathery).  It reminded me of how I feel the crust at Fuel Pizza gets after about 20 minutes out of the oven.  However, the wheat dough at Uncle Maddio's is soft and easy to eat.  Sauce: Both times I chose the Tomato-Basil, which has a nice and noticeable flavor.  I did not need to add anything to make this sauce standout.     Cheese: Yes, there a few options here too.  But it's pizza...you've got to get the Mozzarella...so I did.  Toppings:  You get to choose three.  The two times I was here I got the same three toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, and banana peppers).  I am happy to the report that the mushrooms at Maddio's are sliced fresh and NOT the watery canned variety...which IMHO are awful.  Price - Personal pizza w/ a drink is about right at $10.  Not too bad for the size of the pie you receive here.  Overall - I have Uncle Maddio's in my lunch rotation...I think you should too.",

    "text": "I would argue that uptown Charlotte is fairly limited in its range of lunch time options, so it was a great change for my buddies and I to try something new like Uncle Maddio's Pizza Joint. I'll point out that the culinary competition is rather low in the overstreet mall considering the only three restaurants next to Maddio's are Chick Fil A, Salsarita's and Just Fresh (all equally mediocre). \"How Do You Roll\" lasted a couple of months here, but its presence dissipated in a matter of days once people realized their \"sushi\" was 98% rice and ridiculously overpriced. On the other hand, Maddio's deserves to be in a class of its own because Fast Casual restaurants are hard to find around here (you pretty much just have Noodles & Co., Chipotle, Jason's Deli and Vappiano's... and that's like all Charlotte has to offer in this segment).   Maddio's showcased item is of course, its pizza and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza, and having just come back from Milan, I'm always searching (perhaps in vain) for that same delicious and savory crunch I experienced there. Nevertheless, my favorite part of a pizza is its tomato sauce and I really liked the version they have here. You can smell fresh garlic and perhaps some basil? It's also not too watery or dry. There are other sauces I have yet to try... I was eyeing the \"tomato bbq\". As far as pizza crusts go, this one is certainly acceptable. It's very crisp and holds its shape when you pick up a slice. I do like this pizza much better than Vappiano's which a bit more doughy and its tomato sauce tends to be over salted.   Disclaimer: You can't expect pizza at a fast casual joint like this to be as good as a wood-fired pizza from your favorite Italian restaurant because, let's be real, you wouldn't be able to churn something like that out with the same efficiency that they have here. I only waited 5-6 minutes for my pizza to arrive steaming hot to my table (I tried the spicy Italian on traditional crust - you could also go for the wheat option). For what it is (a  $7 - $8 individual pizza), you'll find yourself eating every last slice. Toppings are varied and fairly good quality - you can even create your own pizza. I like that you can see your pizza being made through the glass window, so you know exactly what you're about to eat.   The salad we ordered paled in comparison to the pizza and some of the sandwich options I saw at people's tables, but that could just be because they stuck to a simple salad menu with generic dressings that every other restaurant has. I think I'll just stick to pizzas when I come here.   There are lots of options for everyone and if you have that \"I've tried one pizza, I've tried them all\" mentality, Uncle Maddio's just might make you rethink that philosophy.   4/5",

The decor is bright and cheerful and the whole assembly line fashion with which they run through the line, have you order and pay is impressive. Everyone I came in contact with through the process was friendly and helpful.   The pizza itself offers a great variety of toppings, sauces as well as three crust options. There are also plenty of gluten free choices. For me the toppings went from pepperoni (nothing special) to meatballs (good) to (carmelized onions (good to have the choice and they tasted good). The just meh parts were the tomato basil sauce which was much too sweet for my taste buds and the crust which is nice and thin and crispy but lacks that chew that great thin crust should have.   I also got a side Caesar Salad and while a little small for $2.99, it was good with homemade dressing. All in all, Uncle Maddio's is a decent new lunch option Uptown that should have some staying power.",

    "text": "I think the biggest thing Uncle Maddio's has going for it also happens to be its biggest downfall: the speed. I showed up with a few co-workers during the lunch rush, and despite the long line they were very efficient at taking orders and getting everyone through the line. The pizzas were also delivered very quickly to the table, probably after only 5-7 minutes. While I was really impressed by the speed during the lunch hour, I think it definitely affected the quality somewhat. The pizza crust is thin, which I love- if done right, but Maddio's thin crust doesn't hold up to the amount of toppings and you end up with a thin and flimsy piece where your toppings are likely to fall off. I was also disappointed in the amount of cheese they gave me and they were very inconsistent between the amount of sauce and cheese given to me and my co-workers. They also piled the toppings in the middle of the pizza, which provides a few awesome bites that are really cheesy and loaded with toppings and some that are floppy dough and sauce only. The tomato basil sauce was okay but I was definitely happier after topping with some oregano and red pepper flakes to give it a bit of flavor that it lacked. I topped my pizza with jerk chicken, sauteed peppers, and portobello mushrooms. The mushrooms and peppers were what you would expect and were decent, but the \"jerk\" chicken was bland and definitely not as spicy or flavorful as I expected. I was pretty happy with the service since the workers were nice and were pretty efficient about everything, but the pizza quality just wasn't top notch.",

The space is totally cramped and small and the owner is obviously keen on turning the tables quickly.  This leads to my recent experience and decision to not return.  I was eating lunch with a colleague and the Owner or Manager kept hovering over us.  He started by just stepping in and pulling away half of the 2 pushed together tables we were sitting at, to create a 6-top 18\" away.  Then, he continued to hover and stare at us until the we finished eating.  Then, he grabbed our pans and tried to show us out, even though we were still waiting on to-go boxes.  I totally understand the need to maximize your revenue during the busy lunch hour, but in this case, he opened up 1 table faster, but lost 2 repeat customers in the process.

I ordered a Margarita pizza and they didn't include basil, then yanked the undercooked pizza from the over too soon so it was under cooked. I advised the attendant that it was undercooked and she said it was not. The \"manager\" came over and said \"it is not undercooked\" when it visibly was. Then he told me to come back the next day because they where \"trying to close the store\".  But they had no problem taking the order and the payment Never again!!!!!",

He accommodated me without any questions. I had the margarita pizza with extra extra fresh mozzarella. You watch them put all the ingredients on your pizza and then they put it in the over. Pay and grab a seat to wait for your order to come to you. My pizza was deliciously cheesy. Had a great crust to it which wasn't so thick nor thin just the right consistency for me. It had a little too much olive oil but that's ok. I ate it al! The place is kept clean with a worker walking around picking up folks trays and trash. A must try if you like pizza.",

I am in the area on a long term project - exploring my food options Walked in the Maddio's Pizza, waited in line until I was asked \"why you want!\" As I gave him my choices of toppings I noticed that the guy perpetrating my Pizza had real LONG breaded dreadlocks - at least 2.5-3 feet long dangling over the prep table. and NO, he did not have a hairnet. I picked up my order and as I was paying for it asked the cashier if they Did Not need to wear hairnets? she said of course we do and pointed to her hairnet and said \"and I am a cashier\". then I pointed out that the guy with long dreadlocks did not have any - she said that is not correct - I will mentioned that to our manager.  Today, I stopped by again for lunch. The same guy, with the same long and \"unsightly\" dreadlock and still No Hairnet!!. I turned around and went to another store instead.   I will not go to this or any other Uncle Maddio's until I see this issue has been addressed.",

I printed the email, brought it in, and was still told by the manager Angel Sotomayor that the person who out in the email blast put it in wrong and it's ONLY for the Midtown location. In all my years of business and customer service, IF you send something in WRITING, you should honor that. Also, IF the person whom sent the email blast did not properly send out the correct information, HOW IS THAT THE CUSTOMER'S FAULT? It was the difference of a dollar, BUT it's the principal especially when I come here often and order for my team as well instead of going to the other pizza restaurants in the area. Quite disappointed in the \"customer service\".",

    "text": "Finally made it to Maddio's for lunch. It was so convenient!   The menu board was a bit hard to read and only had their newest specials. Even the build-your-own wasn't great because it said to pick three toppings but never provided a list of what toppings there were. Later I noticed these small pizza plates stuck to the side wall adjacent to the menu which listed some of the pizza options still available not on the new menu, but it was nearly impossible to read the ingredients list for those options.   On the other hand, the place was kind of like the Subway of pizza. You choose your bread--regular or whole wheat--and size, then you either get one of the pre-decided combinations or you choose your own toppings. Everything was fresh and you could taste that difference. Plus, if you sign up for their rewards program, you get a free 9\" pizza just for signing up and it's essentially a buy 10 get one free system.   I am really looking forward to coming back and trying their foldwiches which are--you guessed it--taco-like sandwiches made by folding a pizza dough in half (think calzone that doesn't get rolled closed) as well as their breakfast options (although those look a little small).   Reasons for not four stars: menu/ordering issues as stated above, slowness of cooking time (there is an order online option which I might try in the future), lack of seating and tables which have residual oil on them (I'm in my work clothes for goodness sake!), and the fact that it cost $0.50 for an extra topping on a 9\" pizza when there's more than one inch of topping-less crust (so ~7\" of topping space). That's like three olives! Crime!!! Honestly, there is too much uncovered crust on these babies. I'd suggest offering dipping sauce...",

I agree it is crowded but if you cannot manage the crowd you can limit your customers and atleast give the ones who are paying for your service a decent experience.  There was an African American lady at the billing counter who misbehaved, had a very bad attitude and had only one answer 'sorry can do anything' for every question asked even as a loyalty customer. Seriously again if you are busy, limit your customers but serve well. We were still eating when an elderly man from Maddios grabbed all the condiments from our table literally assuming we were done - fyi we still had two slices. Learn to be good or kindly LEAVE. Other restaurants around who are even busier eg Chick fil A still know how to treat their customers.",

Seriously, it's amazing that the flatbread crust is even able to support the weight of the heaping mountain of meat and veggies. Very customizable too with a lot of options for crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.  Today I got a custom pizza with wheat crust, garlic olive oil sauce, mozzarella cheese, and grilled chicken, bacon, and pineapple as the toppings. The ingredients taste really fresh and my toppings went well with the garlic olive oil sauce (more so than with the tomato basil that I usually order).   This place gets really busy at lunch time, but there is a very efficient process that keeps the line moving. Don't be surprised if your pizza lasts for 2 meals.",

Next, sauce is added to your pizza. I always ask for extra sauce because it's very robust. Included in the price of your $7 pizza are three toppings. There are several options and they are fresh vegetables. If you ask for heavy toppings, they generally won't nickel and dime you. Your pizza is then slid in the oven to bake.  While this is happening, you'll be given a number on a plastic circle and told \"Thanks, this was made with love\" by the..... seasoned lady who's been working at Maddio's since it opened. Next, you go to the cashier and pay. Find a seat or a space to stand and your pizza will be brought to you based on the number you're given.   During prime lunch hours, Maddio's can get very crowded, so be prepared to wait if you're looking for a seat. Never a bad experience here. Always good food. Always good service.",

So ordering 7 pizzas required several of us to walk over & schlep it all back to the office  The pies were all of the thin variety & the crusts were pretty flimsy-floppy.  And I'll admit I'm a thick crust fan but I can definitely appreciate a thin crust ...but at least give me something that will stand on it's own & not drop the toppings all over the plate  Flavor was okay - had better, had worse.  The sauce to cheese ratio was average as well - nothing remarkable  We had a lot of leftovers, ranging from the standard pepperoni, to meat-lovers, to veggie & the team was happy to finish up the bunch, the following day for lunches - but I didn't partake.  Happy Hour tastings were enough for me  So overall, this was a decent assortment of pizzas but I'd personally seek elsewhere before coming back",
