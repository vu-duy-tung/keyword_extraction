The take-out is pretty consistently bad.  I have ordered take-out several times and there has been a dish or two missing out of every order.  If you talk to the staff, they could care less.  I spoke with the manager about it once and he was very apologetic.  The website for handling ordering works really well but the execution for take-out is consistently terrible.  I wish they would fix their take-out issues.",

There are a lot of nice flavors in the lo-mein, the lettuce wraps can't be beat for a light yet healthy meal, the prix-fixe menu is a great deal and the lunch bowls are offered seven days per week (perfect for those of us w/smaller appetittes). My only negative observation is the beef in the broccoli beef has been a bit chewy both times I've ordered this.  There is often a short wait for lunch and a long wait for dinner, so call ahead or try to grab a seat at the bar. The service has always been excellent.

    "text": "I really wanted to like PF Changs, unfortunately they just didn't do it for me.  We went on a Wednesday night around 7, and the place was packed. Dining room, was VERY loud.   A friend of mine made me promise I would try the Changs spicy chicken, as it is his fav dish there. Let me say for $16, i was expecting a lot more than a mediocre plate of chicken, with a tiny bowl of dry white rice (not sticky at all). They couldn't even cook rice right??? Something was seriously wrong.   The service was trying way to hard, to be way fancier than they are. Someone else mentioned the \"better than you\" attitude that seems to exude from the wait staff, and I couldn't agree more. They were pretentious, and overbearing. Couldn't help but giggle at the nicely dressed wait staff walking around with their noses up, and white Chinese take out boxes on trays. A walking contradiction??  I have paid $5 for takeout that blows away the entree that I ordered that night.   Also knowing that you can buy these famous entrees, frozen now, in the grocery store has cheapened the product. Just just pick up your stir fry right next to the TGI Fridays frozen mozz sticks.   PF Changs is having a identity crisis. Are you fancy and overpriced? Yet still serve mediocre food?? Why is this place so popular???  Overall I would never go back, just not for me.",

Meals in general are delicious but we were disappointed with the quality of meat in both the Mongolian Beef and Pepper Steak. Menu says \"tender pieces of steak\" but the meat was as bad as any other cheaper Chinese joints. The Crab Won Ton was a major disappointment with a tiny little cream cheese twisted inside the shell and no taste of crab whatsoever. The so called \" Prawns\" are basically large shrimps. We have had prawns in Louisiana and Australia as well. Two of those will actually make a meal!! Please change the menu to read Jumbo Shrimps. And please remove the description \" Tender\" from your beef meals. Service and ambiance/ decor are quite good.",

A few minutes later, a booth had apparently opened. A reddish-brown haired Asian woman had took us to a table, not a booth. We informed her that we asked for a booth. She didn't bother to ask any other employees if there were any booths, she just looked around and said there weren't any. Look out for her. Something that lead to my dismay was that a family that came in after us ended getting a booth and were served first.   Our actual waitress was very nice though, one of the only good things about our experience. We had ordered our food and waited a whopping 40 minutes. That wasn't pretty either. I guess it was worth it, cause the food was pretty good. I recommend the \"Chang's Shrimp and Lobster Fried Rice,\" it's spicy and has two choices of seafood in one.   When we were finished, the bill was a fair price, another good thing. So my overall experience of this was the restaurant's food and its price was pretty good, but those things had failed to make up for the service. Maybe not going to this location anytime soon.  TL;DR: This restaurant has very delicious food along with a very good price. However, its service was definitely not good. Be cautious when going here.",

    "text": "Good morning yelp viewers - just a quick update on this establishment. Ordered fried green beans (ok taste), shrimp dumplings ( sauce was terrible), pork dumplings (sent back), fried calamari (served cold and asked to return).  Asked  waiter to request our server to come visit our table - eyes were rolled and he walked off.  Manager came over to assure items would be removed and replaced. The pork dumplings were replaced but management wanted to assure us the smokey flavor is normal. As you can see from the photos both sauces have very different colors and much different taste. The dark color was served first but next order was replaced correctly with rich color and flavor. Huge difference in the before and after foods served. Sad part was while I'm explaining very nicely my concerns, I was quickly hushed and cut off. Managers active listening skills require improvements and I feel sorry for his staff here. Engage with your customer listen and improve don't tell me what I don't enjoy - just listen that's all I ask. LISTEN AND MAKE CHANGES!!!",

But that may be just me. Their portion sizes are huge which is a plus.",

    "text": "We went on New Years for takeout It took forever for our orders to be even be taken (10-15 minutes), even though there were nearly 4 employees standing there at the front entrance and no line. We were also there in between dinner and lunch, maybe around 3, so they weren't overly crowded.  Once we finally ordered, our food took nearly 30-35 minutes to come out. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, with brown rice and an egg roll and my friends ordered similar dishes. All of us ordered lunch portions. About twenty minutes into our wait, one of the employees offered us complimentary beverages. We all asked for Sprite. The Sprite tasted watered down and had a horrible after taste, but it was free, so we didn't say anything, because we felt bad.  Once we got our food home, half of it was cold and undercooked. When one of my friends tried to call the restaurant to explain this situation, he was put on hold for several minutes and given the run around.  I don't doubt that maybe they were having an off day, but this food was kind of pricy for what you get and this was just disappointing. I may try PF changs again in the future, but maybe not this location.",

    "text": "Looks like I should have read the reviews before I made the decision to even go to this restaurant....  Since I had just finished up at the mall  across the street, I decided I'd get some food to go. I went to this pf Chang's on Monday night (May 2,2016) when I arrived the hostess greeted me and I informed her that I would like to place a to go order. I actually LOVE Pf Chang's and was craving their lettuce wraps. Well, I placed my order of lettuce wraps and ginger chicken with broccoli and was told the wait would be 20-25 min. Ok, cool.   I took a call outside of the restaurant and returned right at 20 minutes. I checked with the hostess to see if my order was ready and she said it would be \"a few more minutes\" well,  a few minutes turned into 20 more minutes. So I approached the hostess stand again to get an updated wait time. She went to the kitchen and returned, empty handed.... She then goes on to say that the kitchen has been \"very behind\" on this night and some guests that were eating inside of the restaurant had been waiting for \"about an hour\" for their food.   Now, if she knew there were people in the restaurant prior to my arrival that were waiting for some time, why would she even quote a 20-25 min wait time for a to go order?? Needless to say, I told her to cancel my order and left. Had I been told from the beginning that the wait was almost an hour I would not have wasted my time nor the cooks time.   To the operating partner, Everett Emery,  please ensure that your staff is upfront and honest with your customers to avoid any confusion and frustration. The hostess also seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with the phone, greeting guests and going back and forth to the kitchen. Perhaps she needs someone there to help her.",

The last three times I've been here, it's taken 2.5 hrs for a simple meal (app and entree, no dessert or coffee).   The FRIED GREEN BEANS appetizer is unhealthy but very tasty. There is a thick crunchy coating on the beans, and the dipping sauce is spicy.   I asked if they could do CHANG'S SPICY CHICKEN WITH TOFU, and it was no problem. I chose the 5 spice baked tofu which was very firm and almost the texture of chicken. The sauce was sweet, similar to a sesame sauce, but overall the dish was great.   Husband was very happy with PEPPER STEAK. The sauce was flavorful over a nice mix of veggies and thinly sliced beef.   If it weren't for the incredibly slow service, I'd come here more often, if for no other reason than that is vegetarian friendly.",

The selection of drinks was wide and broad. The menu is also just as vast. The main problem was running out of sushi at 6:30 is quite bad for any restaurant looking for the variety. We ordered many different apps and they were all alright, including the mains. Nothing was bad, but i have to say nothing was terrific I either.

    "text": "First impressions are everything.  I ate here yesterday evening (around 7PM on a Tuesday)...  My friend and I attempted to enter through the revolving door; however, there were two children blocking the entry...one on either side of the frame, both pushing. We stood there for a moment, staring at them, assuming that their father would take charge and make them stop...he didn't.  We entered through the side door.   The hostess was polite, but was either deaf or incapable of answering my questions. She stood behind her register along with another female and an older, bald male, who may have been her boss...he just stared at me and watched as the woman seemingly ignored me.  We were then taken to our booth. I ordered warm sake and an ice water; my friend had a water.  Eventually, empty plates were brought out. Despite the dim lighting, I could see many, many water spots all over the plates and silverware...  Parents allowed their children to run around and act like animals. Since I faced the lobby area from my table, I could clearly see the clientele that this place attracted. People who dine here seem incapable of acting like civilized members of society...laying on the benches inside the restaurant, acting obnoxious at their dinner tables, talking on their phones...did I mention that there were kids running around the lobby as their inattentive parents ignored them?  I digress...  My friend's Mongolian beef tasted pretty good. It sure as h*ll was not worth $18. The portion wasn't exactly worth it and the beef (which he allowed me to sample) was dry and chewy.  My ginger chicken was nice. Plump and juicy, very flavorful...the rice, though, was barely warm.   Overall, I would not go back here unless I were given a gift card. The food portions are overpriced and the atmosphere is...lol...I don't know an accurate word to describe it.   A word to parents: control your kids. It's not my fault that you decided to procreate, but it reflects directly upon you when your kids act uncivilized. You're the main reason why I am negatively reviewing this restaurant.  A word to management: lower the prices a couple of dollars, clean your cutlery and dishes and ban parents who allow their kids to use your restaurant as a playground.  I probably will not return here...unless a friend offers to pay for my meal and a good amount of alcohol is in store.",

I got a lobster sauce dish that was largely flavorless. About a year later, I decided to give it another try, thinking that maybe I had ordered the wrong thing. This time I stuck to more familiar territories and got some sort of bulgogi inspired dish that was being called out on the menu (I wish I remembered the name) and my husband got the Singapore Street Noodles. My dish tasted odd to me, with a very strong, bitter even, taste of orange zest. His was a bit better, but neither of us enjoyed it. I didn't even enjoy their crab rangoon, which I usually love.   I have had authentic Chinese and Americanized Chinese food, all types of Asian cuisine...and somehow the fusion P.F.Changs delivers tastes odd to me, bland when it shouldn't be and too intense in others.  The staff and ambience are very nice, but ultimately the food is not simply not for me. Since then, I have been (affectionately) calling it P.F. Chunks.",

    "text": "Fix it Jesus. Got takeout here on a Friday night. I called and placed my order at 9:10. I ordered the lobster fried rice, bowl of sweet and sour soup, and calamari. I was told that my order would be ready around 10:00-10:05. Having experience with this location, I knew to arrive early because they consistently greatly overestimate the time it will take before food is ready. I arrive at 9:40. There are two women getting takeout in front of me. The first is paying and the other is sitting and appears to already be irritated by the staff. The first lady leaves and I stand where she was. No one acknowledges or greets me for five minutes. Not so much as a \"be with you in a second\". I make eye contact with the irritated lady who obviously shares my pain of feeling invisible. There were at least three people behind the counter working. The lady looks at me and says, \"Takeout is supposed to be to avoid the wait, huh?\"   Finally, a less than friendly hostess asks the name on my order. She looks at the bags and finds mine. Yes, around 9:45 (15-20 minutes earlier than expected). I give her my debit card and she give it to a male co worker, who ultimately puts it down. So there I am sitting with my food getting colder by the minute with my card in sight, but no one to ring up my order. Then all three hostesses leave. The devil on my shoulder urged me to reach for my card and walk out the door, but that would be some form of theft and wrong so I waited. The girl comes back and ask if anyone rang me up. After I tell her that no one did, rather than doing it herself, she takes off (as my food continues to get cold) and looks for the guy. Unable to find him in the restaurant, she finally returns a few minutes later and tells me that she had no idea why he didn't ring up my order, but that now she can do it.   By this time, I've been in the restaurant about 15 minutes and I'm irritated and in full diva mode. So I request a fresh order of calamari. The girl finds the man, who I take is some sort of manager. He comes and ask me what is wrong with the calamari so that he can relay the message to the chef. I explain that when I ordered, I was told not to arrive until 10:00, but that I came at 9:40 and my food was already ready. Having waited an additional 15 minutes in the restaurant, I figure that my calamari is at least 20 minutes removed from the pan. Everyone knows that fried food can't be reheated. This manager (?) is an older gentleman with a suit on and is visibly displeased with my request as he notates on paper why I am asking for the fresh calamari. He ask, should I get you fresh soup too? I explain that soup can be reheated without compromising the texture of food. He shakes his head, take the calamari, and disappears to the back of the restaurant.  During this time, the lone positive of this entire visit occurs. One of the hostesses, a young black girl with ombre hair in a ponytail, smiles and ask if I'd like a drink while I was waiting. Could it be..... yes it was... good customer service. I politely declined, but thanked her for asking. Eventually the other hostess (the one who rang up my order) returns with the calamari. Note: It wasn't the manager. What an a**hole. I went home, ate my food (nothing to write home about) and vowed to write a scathing Yelp review.",

    "text": "I've been eating at the PF Changs by Southpark my whole life and it's always been one of my favorite restaurants. this location is closer to where I live now so we frequent it occasionally, it has never been as good as southpark but last night might be the last time we have dinner here.  It was a Sunday at around 6 and we were immediately seated. Our waitress was very friendly and took our drink and appetizer orders, we got the lettuce wraps. They were delivered with no spoon for the sauce, and with no plates. We had to wait for about 5 minutes with our food getting cold before we got our plates. The wraps themselves were good, luckily they havent changed these.   I've been ordering the kung pao shrimp for a good 10 years now, and last night it was delivered and it was unrecognizable. PF Changs has undergone a complete revamp of the menu and drinks. (They've gotten rid of all their old signature cocktails which were far better) and they have changed  A TON of the dishes. The kung pao shrimp is one of these, the shrimp were so heavily battered and dry. It was nothing like what I've been accustomed to. I know this isnt a location decision, but a corporate one, but the food was no where near as good as it used to be before all the changes.  We ordered 2 desserts, the chocolate dome and the cheesecake, both were very good. Overall, it wasnt the worst meal ever, but if you are used to the old PF changs, you will probably be disappointed.",

    "text": "Lettuce Wraps! Most people get a little crazy/weird about how much they love P.F. Chang's lettuce wraps. After a busy day shopping at the near by Northlake Mall, my group of 4 stopped into P.F. Chang's to re-fuel and rest our feet. P.F. Chang's is located at a stand alone store outside the mall.  There is plenty of parking, but I would imagine that this location can get pretty busy during peak times.   I ordered a cup of egg drop soup and the chicken Pad Thai. I'm a big fan of egg drop soup and I like the crunchy bits they bring as a topping. From what others were saying at the table, the hot and sour soup is apparently pretty hot here. The Pad Thai came served with a lime and two very large spoons.  The spoons kind of confused me, but the noodles and sauce were really tasty. 2 people at the table split the lunch for two. For $40 you get a cup of soup, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. There is also a lunch special for an entree for $9.95 or $10.95.   Service was a little off on my most recent visit.  It took the waitress quite some time to take our order and bring us some straws.  We arrived before the big lunch rush, so the delay wasn't because the restaurant was packed.  After she brought the soups and straws, we did not see her again until after we had finished eating.  The supplemental waiters were helpful with refilling our drinks and getting us our meal.    P.F. Chang's is pretty good for chain food.  I think it is generally over priced despite a few specials and the service can be a little spotty.  There is no shortage of food here though and you are really paying for two meals. Nothing overly positive, negative, or memorable about this location.",

Then ordered the Sichuan Chili-Garlic Chicken from holiday menu which says THINLY sliced chicken but came out to be a large 3 piece fried chicken with some toppings and they were out of fried rice at 8:30PM on a Friday evening.I just touched the dish and left it all completely disappointed. Next is the garlic noodles, which has a good flavor but why are my noodles made in lumps stuck altogether. Half my bowl was like that, and how can someone can't get the basics right in preparing noodles. Completely disappointed to travel 30 miles for this place and ruining my holiday evening.",

Each person gets a choice of soup, an appetizer (starter), choice of entree & 2 desserts. So necessary!  Because the mall is right behind it & it's on a major highway, be prepared to wait. They stay busy. I like their take out option too. They are always so friendly, throughly go through your order, & make sure you're happy.  The wait staff are nice, personable & professional.

So why the 4 stars?  Because of the way they handled the situation.  The waitress checked in after I had given my best and ate about half of the meal.  I told her about the situation and after apologies, brought the manager over immediately.  He offered to replace the meal without even making me repeat my complaint.  As I had already eaten appetizers, soup (both of which were great) and half the entree I said no, that would not be required and thanked him for the offer.  At this point I was satisfied with the attention because as I said, this was my first disappointment and everyone has a bad day now and then.  He then stated he would remove the entree from our bill without me saying another word.  He graciously apologized, thanked us for our business, and said he hoped we would come in again.  Now THAT's great service.",

As soon as we sat down, our waiter was there to take our drink order.   We got the 2 for $40 and tried a few different things. The lettuce wraps are delicious. They don't usually come with a dipping sauce or anything, but it's really not needed. For entrees, we got Honey Crispy Shrimp and Spicy Scallops. Both were awesome.  The only reason we didn't eat all at one time was to save some for next time.    Overall, great dining experience. For an affordable, intimate, semi-formal date night, this is a good option.",

OK Mr. Foodie Doofus.  Get over your bad self...  I'll just come out and say it.  I really, really like PF Changs!  This food has nice flavors.  Heck even the texture, yes texture, of the Hot and Sour Soup makes me happy.  My favorite dish by far is the Mongolian Beef.  Such a simple thing of sliced steak, green onions and a brown sauce.  But its just so darn good!  The steak is always tender and just tastes yummy with its sort of wok seared edges.  Hard to even describe.  Hell, they may even deep fry the stuff for all I know.  Whatever...  Keep it up!  Service is always fast, friendly and efficient too.  This is a place where it's very clear they spend a lot of time on training and it shows.  See you there soon.  Did I mention I hate chains?",

For $7.25, I received a quart of broth, 3 spinach leaves, 2 small shrimp, and 3 wontons. I will say the wontons are very good, although quite a bit smaller than you usually get at your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.

    "text": "I've been meaning to write this for a while and have kept forgetting, so here goes... I don't like writing bad reviews because I hate to judge a company based on a single bad experience. It was all pretty typical stuff at the beginning. There was a wait, so we sat at the bar & ordered food. But between that moment and when our food came out is when the problem started. Bartender's pals decided they would come up to the bar (specifically, the area where other servers typically pick up their drinks) and the three of them crowded it so the other servers could barely get in to take care of drinks for their own tables, and when they did his pals were constantly bumping into them. Not only this but they were just standing over people's drinks, not really wary of the fact that hair or spit could get in the drinks as they were talking. I might just be picky about that but I think that's disgusting. They took over my space, all huddled over my wallet and drink. Then proceeded to carry on highly inappropriate conversations with their bartender pal, as if  he wasn't working.   From this point on, the only time he helped us was when he brought us our checks (quite a while after we had actually finished). While he was gabbing away about his weekend plans and girls and who's dating who (for about 30 minutes), someone else brought us our food, a bartender from across the bar came over just to re-fill our water, I had to grab another server's attention just so I could get silverware, and no one bothered to ask us how our meal was (it really wasn't terrific by the way, but that's beside the point). Meanwhile, he's pushing free drinks to his buddies. Then, worst of all, one of the bartender's pals reaches over and starts muddling a drink for him. NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! Who does this?! And who the heck lets him do it?! I certainly didn't see him wash his hands and he certainly didn't work there. Not cool dude!  Now, I realize P.F. Changs isn't exactly Ruth's Chris or some 5-star-chef restaurant. However, I still expect SOME degree of professionalism on the part of the staff. At some point, I expected the bartender to look over and say, \"hey guys, we're pretty busy. I'll catch up with you later.\" or maybe \"hey guys, why don't you come down to the other end of the bar  so we can talk\" (and you won't be in the way of other servers or crowding this part of the bar). The restaurant was on a 45-minute wait and the bar area was full- I'm sure he had better things to be doing at that time, instead of gabbing away and leaving the drink-mixing responsibilities to his fellow bartenders. He had responsibilities to his customers and the other servers in the restaurant, and he wasn't taking care of those responsibilities. Since he wasn't taking care of his responsibilities, other staff could have spoken to him or spoken to his pals, or a manager. If one of your coworkers is doing something that's obviously inappropriate, say something! Ask if he could have his friends move, or ask if he could help with something, just to give a hint that there are other priorities that need attention at the moment. If you're a manager and you see this going on, STOP IT! It is your responsibility to be aware of what is going on in your restaurant.  Worst. Service. Ever.",

Our table ordered the ginger chicken, street noodles, spicy chicken, shrimp fried rice, and egg rolls. From the moment I bit into an egg roll as an appetizer I knew that I was in for a very lackluster dinner. I hate to say this but literally EVERYTHING was lacking in flavor except for the street noodles. I've never been to a Chinese restaurant where the food does not come packed with flavor. The ginger chicken tasted like water!! Zero flavor at all although it was well cooked. The spicy chicken was not spicy whatsoever and just tasted slightly sweet. I started to question if they mistakenly gave us honey chicken instead. The fried rice had a distinct chargrilled burnt taste to it which I did not enjoy. Do yourself a favor and don't come here!! Don't pay P.F Chang's high price for low quality food. Hole in the wall Chinese places will serve you better.",

Also this last pickup the black girl with the red lipstick was calling out for carry out orders. I sat and saw she put an order on the counter. I figured my order was not ready, however 10 minutes later the hostess looked on the counter at the same order that was placed there earlier and called my name.

The compensation I received from customer service is enough to make me never return to a PF Chang's restaurant anywhere.  I ordered the Honey Chicken (I order this every time) with no rice sticks. By the looks of the plate I didn't even want to eat it. I wanted to say something but my fiance gets super embarrassed so I sucked it up and emailed customer service later instead.   I received 13 pieces of chicken. Considering most families share their entree here, I'm unsure what you would share but I received this plate of unappetizing honey chicken.  I contacted customer service who was very apologetic since they strive for exceptional service food and ambiance here. In return for my shitty food I received a $10 gift card to PEI WAY (had to look this up to find out what it was and that it's owned by the same company) as well as a card for a free large soda, and free cookie. WOW! I was blown away. I was told I would get a \"be our guest\" package in the mail... I was severely disappointed in what was included in this... I reached back out once I got this in the mail, and to no surprise I did not hear back from customer service.  I won't bother being your guest again, I promise! I can find better places to eat for the customer service and shitty food. Your strive for excellence here was a complete fail!",

Our server was very friendly and attentive, she was always making sure we were satisfied and taken care of. We went with the meal for 2 deal for $40, not bad.   Soup:  Egg Drop: I always love egg drop, it seems hard to mess up. Had good flavor, seasoned well.  Hot and Sour Soup: generous amount of tofu, the bf could not finish it all.   Appetizer:  Dynamite Shrimp: I love this dish and hope they will add it to the regular menu! The sauce is wonderful, packed with lots of flavor and some heat. I wouldn't recommend this to my dieter friends, this is a fried shrimp dish with a cream based sauce.   Entree:  Korean BBQ chicken: had a hint of sweetness overall. Loved the fried green beans, this was a very generous dish in respect to the amount of veggies given.  Sesame chicken: this was my favorite entree. The broccoli was refreshing and crispy.  I love the fact that brown rice is also an option with the entree.   Dessert:  Full sized banana spring rolls: $4 upcharge but so worth it! I LOVE the pineapple coconut ice cream included in the dish. Apparently, it is specially made for P.F. Chang's. Here is a good copy cat recipe:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboutamom.com%2Fpineapple-coconut-ice-cream-recipe%2F&s=dac9deb2fc129c1c7627fa719eb315cd805e962caf28fceba203584c01069bd6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">aboutamom.com/pineapple-...</a> I would buy an ice cream maker just for this!

I returned due to a birthday dinner and was excited. However, things have changed some since last time I visited. Not only with just the food but also with me being pescatarian so having to go out of my norm and order alternative options. I started with the vegetarian lettuce wraps and those were okay. The server explained it was a mix of tofu and water chestnuts so it had a particular taste that I was okay with but don't necessarily need to have next time. As my entree, I ordered the Miso glazed salmon with fried rice. The salmon was really good wasn't the best I've had ever but it was good compared to what I used to order (Chang's spicy chicken) but to be honest the best part of the meal was the fried rice. I will always love the beloved PF Chang's but I've learned there are other Asian oriented restaurants that I can choose from before this one.",

One afternoon after shopping at Concord Mills, my partner and I were starving. We wanted to go to Cowfish, but being that I already drove from University to Pineville then back up to Concord in less than two hours, I did not want to drive to SouthPark. So P.F. Changs won out. It was packed on a Sunday afternoon, but we were seated quickly.   The 6 pieces of dynamite shrimp appetizer came out quickly, but there was a very long wait for the rest of our food. The server kept apologizing, and so did another individual, a manager perhaps.  After our meals finally made it to the table, we quickly realized that comparable food could be had at a Chinese buffet. I will say that the lo mein was the best choice of out all. But not enough that I need to return or pay over $70 for. My lobster fried rice was also a good choice, but it was one of those one and done dishes. I've eaten at too many places around town whose food selections make me want to return as soon as possible.   Not the case here. I assume most of the patrons wouldn't be caught dead at a Chinese buffet, and I don't blame them. But I'm not averse to one, so when I want Americanized Chinese, I'll go there for 1/3 of the price and absolutely no wait.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love P.F. Chang's??? I haven't been back in years and finally came back. This location is always busy every single time I come. We came in with a large party and I expected a wait. The hostess told me 30-45 minutes, which is okay because we have a big party. After waiting for over an hour and my little cousins were whining from hunger, I decided to go up to the ladies and ask them if they had a table ready for us. Keep in mind, it says they close at 10. It was past 9 and I asked the lady if our table was ready. She told me it would be another 30 minute wait because the people at the table we were to be seated at still have not gotten their check or gotten their food. That doesn't even make sense. Of course, I was also hangry so I went off on a tangent and started ranting as to why they told us to wait 30-45 minutes only to wait another 30 minutes when they're about to close anyways. We told them to just seat us at any table and our whole party does not need to sit together.   The organization of seats is not perfect. They need to develop a better system. When we walked in, I noticed many tables were empty and can easily be pushed together, I don't really know why they didn't put us there.   The food is overly salted and honestly, the presentation is the only thing separating it from Chinese Take-Out. Also tell me why we ordered White Rice, but there was Brown Rice mixed in. The rice was so dry and I absolutely hate dry rice. Our waiter was extremely awkward and everyone seemed like they hated their job. I also witnessed a lady yelling at whom I believe to be the manager. I think they were just having a bad night or something. Some of the people at the front desk are not friendly and just seem to be standing there smugly judging you.",

The only minor complaint I could come up with is that the food portions are a little smaller than the Southpark location but hey that's probably a good thing for my waist line.  Note that there is often lenghty waits on weekends so call ahead seating is a must during peak hours.  This place is popular already but with the mall right next door, it makes it even busier.",

    "text": "The new location at Northlake Mall is insanely popular, so be prepared to wait for up to an hour or more to be seated. It is popular for a reason though: excellent food and great service.  The lettuce wraps are a perfect appetizer, and in my experience, any of the chicken dishes are superb. The prices are also better than you might expect. A single person can have a nice meal and a few beers and get out for around $20. Not bad.  The portions are also a decent size. There is plenty if you'd like to take some home, but they don't overload you, nor do you go home hungry.  The bar area is small, but a great place to wait for your name to be called, and if you're lucky you may snag a table there or outside on the small patio area.  Of course, there is quite a bit of jostling for these prime pieces of real-estate, and it can bring out the more interesting characteristics of a person's personality.  I'm docking one star due to the excessive wait times, but this is really due to the restaurant's popularity than to any organizational problems.  Still, when it comes to food this tasty, I hate to wait!   Four stars for you!",

It is for sure one of those restaurants that everyone needs to at least try a couple times. It is not usually a place I pick to go to but. It tends to be the place my friends pick when we all go out. It is always over crowded no matter which location you go to. I honestly have not decided if it is over priced yet or if the prices are right on. The food is tasty but not close to being authentic Chinese that I am used to from back home. They do have the original lettuce wraps that every place seems to have now and certainly no one else can match. They do have some great desserts as well. Ultimately they are to good for just three stars and maybe not quite four stars but they are definitely somewhere in between.",

I ordered a tofu dish with veggies and brown rice the specials come with a choice of soup or salad which is great and the prices range from $7 to $16 or so a dish.  Anyways I had to dig through my veggies just to find 1 of the maybe 5 pieces of tofu that were actually in my dish.

I am not bothered by these titles and therefore dined at P.F. Chang's for the first time without any clear expectations other than a great meal. It was a friend's birthday and she wanted a small group to meet at P.F. Chang's for dinner. We sampled almost every appetizer on the menu and a great many entrees and from then on I was in love. Every dish I have had has been fantastic. They are very accommodating, as they offer a gluten free menu and many vegetarian options. They have a happy hour with discounted appetizers and drinks which is a really great way to try their appetizers for a lot less money. They also offer a \"Warrior Card\" which gets you 10% off your entire purchase and access to other goodies via email. They food is always great and really tastes like some love was put into it, an experience one does not often get in a chain restaurant. The staff is always very nice and incredibly helpful. On many occasions, the manager has presented coupons to diners to use on their next visit just as a thank you for dining with them. I took my mom to P.F. Chang's for her birthday (its her favorite) and our waiter brought us a complementary beef dish to ensure we had all proteins represented! I have never had a bad experience but I will say that this location in particular is very hospitable so I would recommend it for your first time. Don't let its lack of authenticity or the sheer fact that its a chain keep you from giving it a try.",

However...we ordered the spicy chicken and orange peel beef.  The chicken was not at all what I had at another Chang's.  Very bland.  The \"sauce\" on the beef was also bland, and the \"beef\" itself was nothing more than fired flour.  You could still see loose dry flour on it!  We sent it back, and the very apologetic waiter replaced it with beef a la sichuan, our favorite dish there normally.  It was also flour-y but burned!  Even the vegetables in it tasted burnt.  I sent it back and explained the issue to the waiter who said he would send the manager out.  The manager never came, but they did take the beef off the meal.  My boyfriend had the dynamite shrimp, and it was overly battered and not at all what he's had at other Chang's locations.  Needless to say, we left hungry and upset.  Overall, very unimpressed.  We will not be back at that Chang's.",

The apps came out one at a time (ours and then my son's 10-15 min later). Then their entrees came, but mine was a good 10 min later...all delivered by different people. When a salmon dish arrived, we asked if it was the Norwegian salmon my husband ordered or  the steamed salmon I ordered. He had no idea and literally put it on the table and walked away. A manager stopped by and we were going to say something constructive, but she gabbed on about my husbands golf hat it was hard to get a word in.

After waiting to get seated and then another 15 minutes for the server to show up in a dining room with empty tables we were finally able to place our order. Ten minutes later, the server comes back to tell us they are out of our entree without a menu in hand (patience), and asks \"if\" we'd like to order something else. We politely asked for a menu since we didn't know what else was on there and had to wait once again for him to go and get it, leave and then come back to re-take the order. Another 10 minute goes by and the server is back to alert us the second entree we ordered wasn't available either. I asked the young man to let us know what items were not available so we didn't order a third time to wait another 10 minutes to be told it wasn't available once again. His response to me was that he didn't know because the managers weren't informing them. At that point we were probably visibly aggravated and the server said his manager would be over to talk to us. At that point we left because we weren't going to waste another minute for someone that clearly wasn't doing their job in the first place to come over and try to explain this incompetence. Things do run out in a restaurants wether due to high demand, delayed deliveries or poor inventory management . Not keeping your staff informed and setting your servers up for failure rather than success during dinner time where they depend on patrons having pleasurable dining experiences to receive a decent tip speaks volumes about the management in general, their lack of regard for their employees and  blatant disrespect for people's time as this entire ordeal took close to an hour.Needless to say we will never be back.",

    "text": "I've eaten at this P.F. Chang's several times. My experience was less than favorable a few of those times. After my last visit, I decided I wouldn't return. Well, I went against that today because I was sent a free birthday gift for being registered to their email club. So I ordered chicken lettuce wraps and the Singapore chicken w/brown rice. My first bite into the Singapore chicken was disappointing. It didn't taste fresh at all. I decided to look past it and keep eating. Big mistake. As I'm eating, I bite into something hard and crunchy. I immediately spit it out. As I look further, I find egg shells in my food. Happy birthday to me, indeed. This is definitely my last visit. I'm done.",

However, I visited the one in charlotte and had a server named Chris that went above and beyond. He was very punctual with his service on top of just being a very well mannered server. Most of all he was personable and a pleasure every time he came to the table. The food as always was delicious. I would recommend the lettuce wraps from the starters as they were my favorite and fun to share. I will definitely be back to this location because it felt more welcoming and less like I was being forced in and out.   P.S The drink are well priced for the liquor you are getting.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a family favorite, particularly for take-out. We typically call ahead or order online. Once you start ordering they can save and repeat your previous order, and at pick-up the hostess is very prompt in finishing processing your order and getting your food out to you, ensuring that everything is correct before you walk out of the door.  Some of our favorite dishes are Chang's Spicy Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, Egg Drop Soup, Honey Chicken, Spring Rolls, and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps.   What's that you say? \" Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's basic Chinese.\" Well sure, these are popular Chinese take-out dishes, but P.F. Chang's does a good job of making their food taste fresh and unique. Try it once and you'll definitely see it is not like all other Chinese take out spots.  Their dishes are not overly salty, or greasy, but really, really flavorful. All of the chicken dishes are savory and come in a great portion size. Each entree also comes with a little box rice (white or brown, your choice). Even the egg drop soup is a little different than your average, but just as , if not more delicious.   If you haven't tried this restaurant or this location, I highly recommend it.",

We were seated at 7 but my friend did not get her food for another 2 hours while others were getting their bills/checks. She spoke to the manager, he was dismissive, but her food was free. Our waiter Marvin was polite and apologetic.   Vegetarian: They have about 5 options for vegetarian entrees and I ordered the Ma Po Tofu. The texture was soft on the the inside and chewy on the outside. It was probably typical of tofu but I did not enjoy it and sent it back to the kitchen. I replaced it with a vegetable fried rice, and they brought it in a Togo container. I had spring rolls as my appetizer. The rice and rolls were mediocre and tasted like they would at any \"Chinese\" restaurant. My total was 15.  Meat: There were no complaints or rave reviews from the table. My friend got the chicken lo mein and she said there was more chicken than she expected and she enjoyed the flavor. Her total was 13.   Overall:  We were there for a birthday dinner and the birthdsy-girl had a good time. They refrigerated her cupcakes and they don't sing Happy birthday. That said, I was generally disappointed",

And not just a little bit but a lot? My server apologized and had the bar make a new one. The replacement drink came and it was like straight sugar. How can the bar not make a simple drink like an old fashioned.  So I ordered the pepper and wine braised flank steak. When my meal arrived the plate they brought me clearly was a dirty unwashed plate. The dish itself was slightly small for portion size. There was only two pieces of broccoli in the whole dish and the nappa cabbage was weird super wilted soggy bits with a very anemic color. The flank steak was super dry almost unpalatable. The white rice was also very dry. I don't expect authenticity when I come to P.F. Changs but I do however expect to get quality, definitely not way beyond sub standard quality.  So I asked for my check and brought attention to the dirty plate.  The server said \"eww\". How do you think I felt? She didn't even bring a manager over or anything. I have my bill... none of my food or drink was discounted. I didn't even touch the second drink because it was too sweet. I don't expect to just get a discount because something went wrong, but my dinning experience was more than just a little wrong. At the very least have the manager come over and apologize. - STAY AWAY!",

    "text": "1st time ever going to PF Chang's and my aunt wanted Chinese food so bad so we decided to try it out. We typically go to buffet style restaurants but with it being flu and cold season we opted to try here. The waiter was Ok but seemed less than pleased to have us seated in his area. He asked if we had ever been there before and we said no so I assumed he would have threw out a couple of suggestions. That didn't happen. He brought us drinks 20 minutes later and needless to say he never once mentioned \"Oh by the way those are not free refill drinks\". So I asked about the Mongolian beef and he raved about it so I ordered it well let me say it is way beyond salty. I sent it back and I definitely didn't order anything else. When the check came I still left a tip and once he saw that he became a lot more friendlier well hell we are getting ready to leave now. And on top of that the manager didn't even come out to speak to me about me sending the food back. 1st and last time I will ever come here again. 1st impressions are everything to me. would give it less than 1 but there's no option for that.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited this P.F. Chang's recently.  We enjoyed our visit and enjoyed our food.  Two things distinguished this from other P.F. Chang's we have visited: (1) the tables seem more crowded together (and since they all were full I presume that is because of the place's popularity); (2) they were out of the first three bottles of wine we ordered.  I tend to view chains negatively, and Chang's does nothing to dissuade me from that.  I am sure there exist good analyses of American chains doing ethnic foods, and I will let those speak for themselves.  The chain obviously is enormously popular, and this one does what it does well.",

    "text": "Christmas came and went and I made bank this year and got $225 in gift cards. For some reason though my family thinks I live at P.F. Chang's cause that is where all the gift cards were for.  I mean I am no going to complain about free food money. So of course I could not resist, so me and my wife went a couple of days after Christmas for lunch.      First off we have been here before a good number of times. We are far from regulars, but we enjoy ourselves once in a while. Granted it is not super fancy expensive, it still a bit much to go every week on my salary. Getting that gift card is a nice little treat to start the year off.      We arrived a P.F. Chang's around 2pm on Wednesday, Dec. 28. I would call that a nice lunch time hour and we must have shown up right after the rush, because the parking lot was pretty full, place was packed, and NO WAIT!!! Now there is something very important that you must do when you are greeted by the Host/Hostess; ask if Ja'twann is working. Ja'twann is by far one of the best servers I have ever had. He has been working there for a few years now, since I first went to P.F. Chang's. He is a nationally certified trainer, and an awesome guy. Also for all my fellow comic/video game/movie lovers out there he is the server for you. So if you want some awesome service, a charismatic server, a P.F. Chang super star, and overall nice guy, you need to have Ja'twann be your server.       Now since we had all this moolah, we decided on our first free trip we would splurge. Why not??? We started out with 2 appetizers. I am sucker for steamed pork dumplings and my wife loves their fired green beans. Now they always bring out a little dish of sauces which are delicious and spicy. The server, Ja'twann in our case, usually will offer to make you a tasty mixed sauce if you are interested. The apps arrived in a timely manner and were quickly devoured. The dumplings are superb. They are plump nice sized dumplings that are nice little preparation for what is to come. The wife loves the green beans, the batter they use is really good. Appetizers were definitely on a Jet li: Bruce Lee ratio of awesomeness      For our actual lunch we ate very well. I ordered the ChengDu spiced lamb and my wife ordered the Vegetable double pan-fried noodles. After chatting and killing time with Ja'twann, since no once else really came in after us, our food came.  And boy was is good. The lamb was banging, just awesome. It had just the perfect amount of spice to get that little burn, but had a very nice cool minty undertone to keep it from being scorching. I was totally impressed. I got a good portion of rice. I am never really happy when I get a ton of rice and a little meat. So the portion size for me was perfect. I could not find anything negative on this dish at all. Wifey enjoyed her noodles. Direct quote \"Loved them!!!\" took our time eating and enjoyed every last bite, well the Mrs. took the rest of hers home. Overall I would put main entree, using the same awesomeness scale, at a Donnie Yen:Bruce Lee.      Since we wee living it up I had to order the most amazing desert they have, in my opinion. I am proud member of CU, Chocolaholics Unanonymous, so I ordered a slice of  The Great Wall of Chocolate. This thing is a whopping 6 layers of decadent deliciousness. AND it has mini choco chips on the outside icing!!!! So moist and soft and every other amazing thing you think it should be.Needless to say I ate that thing whole and thought my stomach was going to burst. This little morsel receives a shirtless Bruce Lee after smashing a guy in the face with a 5 second WAHHH!!!!!         Overall I think P.F. Chang's is a great restaurant. It has a great variety of foods,  with nice options for vegetarians and some choices for those who go gluten free.  Looking for a nice place to go on a date with your special someone, or nice family gathering? Definitely a place to consider. I mean Beyonce's sister ate here with a Carolina Panther, if I remember correctly, so it must be half way distant hehe. Besides, you will always have a good experience, as long as you know who to ask for.   P.S The few times I have been here I have had some wanna-be good service, this crazy bitch who was very rude, but overall friendly staff.",

Stop ordering Chicken and Lettuce wraps, it's just machine-separated chicken waste in brown sauce with water chestnuts.  Instead, get the ahi tuna or salt-and-pepper calamari.  For entrees, try the wok-charred beef, chicken with black bean sauce, wok-seared lamb, shrimp with candied walnuts, sichuan from the sea, and garlic noodles.  Don't waste your time with chang's chicken, you can get General Tso's at any chinese place for a third of the price.  The mini desserts are a good idea, and the specialty drinks are all very good.  And no, nothing comes with an egg roll.",

(not cooked very well at all) The chicken was fatty and tasted rather old. The dessert (great wall of chocolate) was actually pretty good minus the raspberry sauce. The atmosphere is pretty cool and super nice however the food is definitely not up to par. The service wasn't very good either.  I will never waste another $70 on this place. I'd rather go to a restaurant that's worth spending that. A Chinese buffet would have been the better option and definitely a lot cheaper!",

So if you go to P.F Chang's lettuce wraps are a must, the salt and pepper calamari is delicious, and leave some room for their mind blowing banana spring rolls and don't forget to request for Rick, so far the best waiter I had in Charlotte.",

I got the chicken lo mein, pork dumplings, and beef and broccoli.  The pork dumplings did not have a good flavor or texture. The amount of dumplings that came in the order totaled out to be over a dollar each, and there was not much substance to them.  The chicken lo mein was very good, but a bit dry. The lo mein was probably the only dish that had a good price compared to the amount of food given. The beef and broccoli had a great flavor, but they try to trick you by loading the dish with broccoli and not a lot of meat.  I paid way to much money for the beef and broccoli dish for what they gave me.  The amount of sauce they gave was laughable, huge containers with a shake of sauce. If you have the time dine at the restaurant, the portions there seem to be a lot more than the takeout portions.",

Haley was the PERFECT waitress, I could honestly make an entire post about her attentiveness and servant nature but I will attempt to help others with the overall experience itself. Shorty story here, if you can sit in here section, please do! First off, this restaurant is immaculate! They boast unparalleled cleanliness. The atmosphere, the tables, the silverware, the floor, everything just screamed CLEAN! I attended with one other person and we both shared this sentiment. We were greeted as soon as we hit the door, we were standing at the front for all of 7 seconds before being seated in Haley's section. Where immediately she came over and took our 2 waters with lemon drink order, one with no ice, and she made sure to remember which one was no ice. She was very knowledgeable on the menu. We ended up ordering the Sesame Chicken and Long Life Noodles and Prawns per her suggestion and to say I am overly satisfied is an understatement. The food was INCREDIBLE! The wait time for the food felt like seconds because of the great atmosphere and meticulous Haley was. She made sure we didn't want for anything. The pricing for a place this nice and the portion sizes was surprisingly good. We ended up paying around $15 as we had a buy one get one coupon. This was truly a memorable experience is the most positive way. I hope to dine with Haley again soon! I am definitely recommending this place to EVERYONE I know and even encouraging myself to return ASAP. Thank you!",

It took a long time for our server to come over and get our drinks and an even longer time to get said drinks. Service was overall very slow. We ordered the lettuce wraps and spicy chicken noodle soup as appetizers. The soup was really bland- tasted like regular chicken stock with some mushy noodles in it. Not good at all. We ordered a bottle of wine and it finally came after the appetizers. For mains, we got the Thai Harvest Curry, Chang's Spicy Chicken and Mongolian Beef. The Mongolian beef was the only one we were able to finish. The rest were really bland and I would not recommend them. I most likely will not be returning here because there are so many better Asian restaurants in the area. The food and service was mediocre at best.",

I missed the snow pea shrimp which I thought was a healthier choice.   Soya sauce fry rice, soya sauce black pepper chicken, soya sauce wrap, soya sauce sour soup, it's soya goood !!",

It was all good, although the beef and Broccoli was our least favorite. We left full and happy. Can't wait to return.",

I used to not mind PF Changs, and actually liked them, but their quality of food has gone way down hill.  I ordered the sesame chicken and my husband got the beef with broccoli.  My aunt got some sort of chicken (which seemed overcooked from my taste).  Our dishes were awful, if you love salt you will love them!  I know Chinese is usually very high in sodium, but when you get salt as the main taste rather than bringing out the taste of the beef/veggies, it is an issue.  I really can't say anything good about this place.  So many other good local chinese places that are a better option.",

    "text": "I remember the first time I ate at a P.F. Chang, 15+ years ago in Raleigh, NC. I was amazed at the food and I wanted to eat there all the time. As I became a little more discerning and found smaller independent (and more authentic) Asian restaurants, I wanted to eat less and less at P.F. Chang. By the time they opened a Winston-Salem location 3-4 years ago, I had no desire to eat there. For the most part I knew I could find better and fresher Thai food at any number of local places rather than a chain. So when my lunch guest chose this PF Chang to meet for lunch in northern Charlotte, I wasn't really looking forward to it. The staff there changed my mind!  The food is about like I expected- good but not exceptional. I got the lo mein with beef. We also had lettuce wraps as an appetizer. However, the real star here was the service and the hospitality from the staff. I found them to be extremely nice and efficient in everything they did today. Our food came out promptly, and the wait staff did a great job of keeping our glasses filled. They checked on us regularly without being obtrusive. I'd like to give a shout out to the management at this location: well done! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this P.F. Chang to anyone who is considering eating there.",

Tonight my boyfriend and I weren't feeling cooking and headed out! We were hoping to sit outside, but the tables are sparse on this patio, and the chairs are kind of wide and couch like, so ultimately we headed inside. It was great. We had an awesome meal of our favorites (chicken lettuce wraps, mongolian beef) and I tried one of the newer items. It was the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl. It was so flavorful and lite. I loved every bite.   Special shout out to our server Neal who gave us some tips and locked our app in the POS in time for happy hour pricing (3pm-6pm)! Thanks man!",

PF Chang is Very over-hyped and over priced. I don't understand the draw. The food is average and the ambiance is the same.  I had the pot stickers and the Beef a la Sichuan. The order of the pot stickers came out and was burnt so I had to return it for another order. I had better from the frozen section in the supermarket. The Beef a la Sichuan had scallions that were four inches long and beef was as chewy as bubble gum. The flavor was lacking and the serving size was child size. I don't know if I will be back because I like my Chinese food to taste, like Chinese food, not Lowery's seasoned beef. The restaurant was extremely loud so expect to have a shouting match with the nearby guests.",

Second when I tried to order things online, their system doesn't work on the submission page... Totally waste of your time to select the dishes and Input your name and email etc..  Third, I think this place discriminates Asians too.  When I try to get my seating, the host smiled and introduced the different options for the couple in front of me.  And when it is my turn, the host was not patient and didn't talk to me about any of the seating options.  when I try to ask her, she is really impatient.  When I grabbed  my seat, the server never checked me once after I ordered but she constantly check the other tables.  When I asked my check, I have to call her out and grab her attention.  Because the food sucks so bad, I only tried a little of the food I ordered and ready to leave.  The server asked me do I want to box the food and when I told her no, she didn't even bother to ask if I like the food I ordered or if there is something wring with them.  She just passed me the check and that is it.  Overall, horrible experience and will never return for sure....  Sadly they serving  asian cuisine but trade Asians really bad.",

As a native Chinese, would I miss their food because they remind me of home, or would I miss any of their dishes that lead to constant urges of repeat visits, the answer is probably \"no\".   This is your go to place for business lunch, or just some causal Asian bistro on the weekend, like a bunch deal or something like that.  The only thing worth mentioning is their cabbage wrap, the way they prep it is not authentic Chinese, but it is a good dish choice for those wanting to sound like they know and appreciate Chinese food!! They cater to those with food allergies, so if you have glutton disease or faint due to over consumption of MSG, check them off of your order list! ;)",

He started talking NEW DESSERT WONTONS and when he hinted that the chefs were already on it, we asked if we could order. They're a little chewy--hey, they're not puff pastry--but both the vanilla cream and chocolate raspberry (our favorite) were delicious! I think our favorite part of this stop was getting the impression that both server PJ and manager Chris are INTO the food at PFC and enjoy what they do. Thanks, guys!",

It's expensive but the best thing on the menu (besides Changs spicy chicken) is the sea bass. it is just OMG good.  and if you can't afford the sea bass, get the \"hot fish.\"  Changs never disappoints!",

    "text": "I have been to 3 P.F. Chang's in my lifetime and this is my least favorite.  Just took my girlfriend there this weekend for her birthday celebration, and P.F. Chang's was the worst part of the evening.  Now don't get me wrong we had an amazing evening so in retrospect P.F. Chang's was A-OK.  I suggest making reservations especially on the weekends this is the busiest one I have been to.  The hostess wasn't that great took an hour for us to be seated even though I made reservations.  Was not happy, the great thing was the food here.  If you don't care about eating bad food for you get the lettuce wraps they are delicious.  I had the ginger chicken and broccoli which was great also.  Very large portion sizes for dinner be aware.  The atmosphere was beautiful, but if you are looking for something intimate or romantic stay away just way to loud and open for that feeling.  I suggest going to the P.F. Chang's in Phillips Place personally.  Not as many kids, more of a adult feel.  I would suggest P.F. Chang's anytime, just maybe not this one based on the situation.",

When I advise that perhaps there should be two servers to assist with a large party since some people at one end of the table was able to put their orders in and then the people at the other end of the table orders got put in but drinks  did not come out in a timely fashion. Also we got there shortly after 8pm our food did not come out until sometime around 10 or after 10 our food actually was cold when it did come out. Since we all was at this point extremely hungry no one except maybe one person sent their entree back it was never any compensation offerex by the manager  nor did the server ever ask how was our meal.  The manager  assisted once with replenishing some waters but not with getting the plates out to the table in a timely fashion nor did he help them at the end. Our empty plates and drinks remained on the table the entire time. The manager never sent this poor server Charlie  any help not even  at the end to present the checks. Wedid ended up leaving somewhere around1130 after the restaurant had closed. Based on this experience I would not recommend large parties to dine at PF Chang's  restaurant.",

We were seated 15 minutes later and our sever was nothing but friendly and accommodating, it took a while for us to get our food, but as I said - it was busy.

The brown rice was spongy and had to be returned (wasn't just me; my wife agreed). The fruit they gave as a side order for my son's meal was supposed to be blueberries and raspberries, but they more resembled mush. The chef and/or waiter were obviously making no effort to impress. The ribs were great, the Lo Mein was good, and the Sesame Chicken and Wonton Soup were tiny servings and good (not great). We were also served the ribs without any plates, so we had to wait five minutes to eat them, which led to lukewarm ribs. After all this I anticipated some kind of credit, but to no avail. I don't care about the money. I just told myself that if they make an effort, I will return. If not, I won't. They didn't make an effort. I will not return, nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone. The decor is excellent. Otherwise, you're overpaying for decent-to-good food (not great) and subpar service.",

I prefer to Egg Drop soup than the other one, The fish came out OK without the lots of ginger and green onion.  The Beef dish was way over cooked & dry like rubber.

Unless you like jerky beef, I don't recommend Beef a La Sichuan.",

The entrees came quickly and was served family style so we had shrimp fried rice and some type of chicken and broccoli. I usually hate chicken with glazes and other runny looking stuff on it but it was delicious. The shrimp fried rice that I ordered left much to be desired- I've had better at the mall. We got the sweet treats. Boyfriend got a snickers style treat and I got a salted caramel treat. Dessert was just like any you would get from a chain restaurant- probably taken from the freezer and thrown in the microwave but it was still pretty good.  Overall the ambiance was great, the food didn't blow my socks off but it was still pretty good- I left with a full stomach and plenty of leftovers, and the service was excellent.",

    "text": "I really like P.F. Chang's, but I really hate this location.   Maybe it's my fault. I primarily do take out orders at this store. Look, I get that it's always busy here. But, why is it always a cluster-expletive at the hostess stand and waiting area? There are enough people behind that counter to land a space shuttle. How is my five minute interaction with the workers here always awful?  My latest unfortunate service experience: I placed my take out order Sunday for soup and egg rolls. And by Sunday, I mean it was 3:30pm. It wasn't during church rush-hour. The girl who took my order warned me that at the moment it was taking 25 minutes for to-go orders. Okay, that's fine. She also talked to me like she would rather play in traffic than be behind that counter. Here's the real problem: my order came out ten minutes later. No one even bothered to look at the bag. I never gave it a second thought because I was told it would be at least 25 minutes. I figured it was a call-in order and that's why no one did anything. So, 30 minutes after placing my order I finally walked up to ask about my food. I was handed the bag, which was the only bag there on the counter. I said, \"oh, it's the bag that's been sitting there for 20 minutes and no one called my name.\" The girl just kind of rolled her eyes and gave me attitude. Sigh.  Things to know: like I said, this place is always busy. Go ahead and expect a wait. Your best bet is to make a reservation. Although, the family next to me made their reservation a week ahead of time and still had to wait for their table to be ready. Also, check the bar area. You may be able to snag a spot there.   My favorite thing here is the egg drop soup. I usually just order a large size of that and the lettuce wraps for my meal. I'm also a fan of the Sichuan-style asparagus.  I don't know what the secret is to having a solid experience here. The Phillips Place location seems to function more smoothly than this one. My advice is to just be patient.",

I felt bad for our waitress bc she did everything.  I notice at south park the servers have help . She had wonderful customer service so I definitely commended her for keeping us happy while we waited so long even for a cup of soup . The food didn't taste as fresh and prepared as the PF Chang's in south park , we ordered our usual honey shrimp and Mongolian beef but the taste was off ? I don't think I'll go back to this location or I might not like PF Chang's anymore",

We flagged down the manager who retrieved them.  Our meal arrived after quite some time.  Our drinks had been gone for quite some time.  Once again the manager retrieved.  We discussed our concerns with the manager.  He did offer desert for free which we declined.  The food was great once it got to the table.  Given the experience I can't say we will rush back to a P.F. Changs soon.",

I had the shrimp and orange and was wonderful. Jay had the mongolian beef, a bit salty for me but he liked it. The hot and sour soup is amazing",

I ordered my food at 12:25 online for pickup at 1:00 pm, I arrived at 12:55 and did not get my food until 1:20.  Having to wait 20 minutes for my food past the \"pickup/promised\" time didn't help things.  There was a lady waiting also who looked as annoyed as I was.  We were offered something to drink, but I was hoping to not be there long enough to finish it so I declined.  I expected my meal to be free or discounted or something due to the wait - I didn't even get chopsticks or a cookie.  I got the Buddha's Feast with no mushrooms - they got that part right.  However, there is no flavor in the sauce and the snap peas and asparagus are tough.  The broccoli and carrots are okay.  The tofu is a weird texture and I don't like how it was cooked.  In the absence of siracha at the office, I put texas pete on the dish just to add some sort of flavor.    I won't be going back... I'll stick to the hole-in-the-wall chinese restaurants.",

Don't do take out. It takes longer than just going in and ordering.  Staff is unhelpful and does not know what they are doing. Overall, bad service and not worth visiting.  P.s.

    "text": "Slow service, cold/luke warm food.  I used to like going to P.F. Chang's, even though it costs a lot more for a slight variation on Chinese food (one of the variations being smaller portions).  I ordered right in the middle of the safe zone - I got the customer favorite: Mongolian Beef.  This should have been an easy slam dunk for P.F. Chang's.  The waiter apologized three times for the delay in our food preparation.  One apology is polite, more than that is an indictment that you don't have your act together.  We also go the pad Thai and the appetizer that comes loose that you roll up and eat in lettuce.  The appetizer tasted like it had been burned - sitting too long on a grill that was too hot.  It had a faint taste of burnt wood, gas, charcoal - something smokey like when you burn something.  I am not going back here because the food wasn't hot, the service was slow, and our cold food tasted burned (if it is burned it should at least be hot), and we had to send back plates and flatware because it was still dirty.  Gross on all fronts.  Aside from all these serious violations everything else was fine: our table didn't wobble.  I had to wait so long to be seated I think only Stockholm syndrome is keeping me from giving this P.F. Chang's a 1 star.  Other locations I would say average 3 stars, this place is really a 1.6 so I rounded up.  I reread my own review and kicked myself - this was a 1!",

We didn't have to wait to be seated. We had to wait for our food. It took foreverrrrrrrr. The server was okay, if not annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted as soon as we sat down. Our dining partners had never been to a P.F. Chang's before and had to take their time to look at the menu.  I ordered the butternut squash dumplings. They were okay, but they tasted like Chef Boyardee ravioli with Velveeta. They just weren't doing it for me.  So, between the long wait for food (and, the manager did come to the table after about 20-30 minutes to tell us our food would be out shortly) and the \"meh\" taste of the food, I can't write a great review. Usually I love P.F. Chang's.  With that said, though, we all cleaned our plates, so it was definitely edible :-)",
