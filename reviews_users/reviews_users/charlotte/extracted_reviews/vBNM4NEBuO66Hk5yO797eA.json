    "text": "I had to look back at my profile because I could've sworn that I had reviewed this venerable Charlotte Institution.  This is THE gold standard for comfort food in all of Charlotte and it's been just that for many years now.  That's the beauty of Lupie's- it does not try to be anything else to anyone at any time.  You've gotta love a sure thing, and Lupie's comes as close as you can get to that in Charlotte.  Now this place does not get points for decor.  Inside literally looks like two old shacks put together, in various states of a patched-up repair.  It's dimly lit in the upper portion, a few windows light the lower portion.  The saving grace here might be the large portraits that line the walls- all former workers at Lupies, all showing some personality and depicting real life, not some glamor shot.  Art meets life and the outcome is refreshing.  But if you came looking for a beauty contest, you should drive on by.  The real draw is the food.  Two different kinds of chili star here daily (3 if you count the veggie)- but the winner every time for me is the Texas chili- finely ground beef in a crazy good mix of spices.  Hot but not searing.  You can add beans, cheese and onions which just get lopped on top.  I strongly encourage adding all 3.  Served with a slab of cake-style cornbread- that one bowl will fill me up and then some.  They also do burgers and chili mac if you want to try something different.  The burger easily takes two full hands to manage.  But you should also check the daily special- I had a former co-worker who swore by the meatloaf.  My wife will only go on days when they serve chicken and dumplings.  All come with a choice of veggie sides which change with the seasons.  You can also craft a veggie only plate.  I encourage you to do so, as these too are awesome.  Homemade mac n cheese with a crispy cheese top- sunny heaven in a little bowl.  Spring veggies (when available) are also a reminder that summer goodness is just around the corner.    Beverages are served in mason jars- a nice Southern touch- and the sweet tea is sweet enough to give you a cavity just by looking at it.  But for an even bigger sugar rush- check out the desserts wrapped up by the register- homemade cookies, brownies and more in a variety of flavors.  One is enough to share and you'll be glad you indulged. Just be sure you don't attempt to be seated without the rest of your party in tow- strict policy here that there is no saving of a table. At least the handcrafted sign at the front makes that plainly clear.  A welcome policy during the (busy) lunch rush.",

    "text": "Hell... whats one more review?  When I moved here from Richmond years ago, I had a hard time finding something that felt like home... that southern, tattooed, dirty feelin that only Richmond can give you. Well I managed to find those few blocks of saving grace everyone calls NoDa and then I found Central ave @ Thomas street. Then lo and behold I found Lupies.  Hells yes.  Easy eats in a kinda odd section of town. Cheap greasy food mixed with a dash of southern flavor. Love the limited menu.... get the nachos! I swear I had the best damn green beans I've had in a long time today.  All you bastards expecting more quality food when you go to a 'diner' like lupies can shut it. Its food! Eat it or why did you wait to get a table? You get what you pay for and don't lie.... have you ever had a bad experience at lupies? I think not.   Those mofos can cook.  Eat!",

As we were first timers, Holly did a great job of explaining menu items to my mother and I.  When I asked for a cup of coffee, Holly quickly brewed a fresh pot for me.  The entire meal was delicious and abundant.  The vegetarian chili was a huge hit with my mother and the chili slaw burger hit the spot for me as well.  All of the positive reviews preceding seemed spot on and I highly recommend for anyone seeking simple tastes from a small Southern kitchen.  Can't wait to return.",

    "text": "I work down the road about 2 miles away from this little gem. I would always see it driving by but would never go because I was slightly skeptical. Not in the best neighborhood, not much else around it, and it doesn't have the best curbside appeal. But we had new people start at my job recently, and one of them told me that I had to go and try it because it was delicious. Delicious was an understatement! You walk in and your mouth automatically starts watering because whatever they are making that day smells sooooo yummy. I havent tried the quiches yet, but they all sound amazing. I went in and got the daily special both times I went (within one week of eachother because it was so good) and i ate pretty much all of both. And i generally cant eat all of my food. The first day I went, i had baked chicken as the lunch special and it comes with cornbread and 2 sides. I got broccoli casserole and green beans. I am slightly biased towards green beans because I LOVE them. But the broccoli casserole was the best broccoli casserole I have ever had. If it is an option when you go there, you should get it. The second time I went I got the meatloaf lunch special - also fabulous. I got it with mac n cheese and green beans (again). The prices arent bad at all and the staff are all very friendly. Its a small little restaurant with A LOT of flavor. I definitely recommend it. I can see myself gaining weight in the future from eating all this lovely southern food they have to offer! nom nom nom",

    "text": "Yum!  We tried Lupie's for the first time the other night and were SO not disappointed.  The nachos were Reason #1 to come back - they were so loaded with cheese, jalepenos, and veggie chili that I barely made a dent in one side (my husband barely made a dent in the other), and I had to take home the rest in a box.  The mac and cheese was Reason #2 - my husband got it as a side to his veggie burger, and I think he would have ordered an entire pan if they'd let him.  It had that grotesquely delicious cheesiness I remember from church covered dish mac and cheese growing up.  Fantastic.  Finally, and most satisfying, the banana pudding was Reason #3 to come back.  It.  Was.  Awesome.  The atmosphere reeks of old Charlotte charm, and I loved the clientele - generally older, quiter, more genial than at, say, The Penguin.  I had a teeny wish the menu was a bit more varied, my husband's veggie burger was standard freezer fare (not house-made), and I'd love a craftier beer selection, but overall I imagine we'll be visiting Lupie's pretty often.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a total dive and I love it.  I've driven past this establishment many times, but even with the good things I've heard from folks and read on yelp I was a little hesitant.  The outside is so old and dingy, which is why I always drove right by without even noticing it.  If you like good ole' comfort food for reasonable...wait...CHEAP prices then you will dig Lupie's.  We arrived and were seated almost immediately in the downstairs section of the building.  You can tell the place has been around for a while and the decor is very unique.  It was really hot in the downstairs section.  The dining room by the front door was fine, but it felt like the A/C was out downstairs.  It was bearable for us, but felt uncomfortable when we first walked in.  The server greeted us promptly and was great throughout the meal.  Now on to the food.  I thought everything we ordered was great.  It is a very simple menu with burgers and American fare.  They have a daily special each day as well, which happened to be the Chicken & Dumplins.  I was torn between the Texas Chili (spicy/chunky beef) and the Cincinnati Chili (sweet/finely ground beef) only because I've never tried the latter.  The server recommended a mixture of both, what a great idea!  She said it was really good too, so that helped me decide.  I got it on a bed of spaghetti on her recommendation as well and it didn't disappoint.  It was a huge bowl topped with cheese and onions.  I'm glad I got the mixture because the chunky/finely ground beef mixture was fantastic.  It still had a nice kick even though only half of my chili entree was considered 'spicy'.  My girl got the Chicken and Dumplins and it came with 2 sides.  She got the Mac & Cheese and Squash & Onions.  The Dumplins were fantastic, very creamy and well seasoned.  The Mac & Cheese was a standout as well.  It's the baked style, so you get that thick cheesy crust from the top of the casserole.  I love that, reminds me of my Mema!!  Both entrees were served with cornbread as well.  Both of our entrees were under $7, we each had a domestic beer at $2.50 a pop and the check totaled under $20.  We also walked out full with a to go box.  Bravo Lupie's, bravo.",

Lupie can be seen hard at work in the kitchen. Service was okay. They are not shy about filling your glass up. I asked for a \"little\" more on my refill and they filled it up completely. The wait to get in tends to get long quickly so I recommend going at a non-peak hour if you can.

When entering, it's like walking into someones garage - divey is an appropriate description. The split level set up is interesting, to say the least.   The food more than makes up for any doubts or apprehensive first impressions. What is good? The chili. The sweet tea served with crushed ice in a bead dripping Mason jar. The burgers. The baked mac 'n cheese. The Sweet Potato Kuchen. Usually the daily specials.   I have found the servers to be only slightly friendly, maybe because they are just usually so busy. On a positive note, they never let my Mason jar run dry. This is always a deal breaker and tip buster for me.   Lupie's is a veritable Charlotte lunchtime institution on Monroe Road.

So, here we are. I love the divey,, old fashioned aura that this place exudes.  And music?  A great mix of retro R & B and obscure modern day tunes. My man ordered the quiche.  They had a meaty version and a vegetarian offering.  He got the squash, onion and tomato quiche.  His plate was also filled with fruit and a salad.  I got the vegetarian chili, which included an ample portion of cheese and onions.  The menu boasted that it was hot, and righteously spicy it was, but you know old hot tongue me.  I had to dump Tabasco  sauce on it for that extra special brand of punishment.  The cornbread was fashioned in the correct style, savory, not sweet.  And the service?  Our server didn't have a rude bone in his body.  In fact, every staff member we encountered gave us a heaping helping of hospitality.   So, Lupie's has been redeemed in my book.  Good food with heat and service that is sweet.  Plus, I dig their use of mason jars for serving beverages.",

    "text": "Lupie's Cafe is located on the southside of the Elizabeth neighborhood and is one of Charlotte's most well known restaurants. You know you're in a low down neighborhood dive when you drink water from ball mason jars. There is something quintessentially southern about ball mason jars and the many uses for them. With Q-Tip's Renaissance Rap playing over head and hungry bellies ready to devour everything in sight, we patiently sat and waited while our dinner was prepared.  For Ella's dinner she decided nothing would be better than a good ol' fashioned BLT and a side of chips. The BLT was served on lightly toasted bread, with a generous amount of lettuce, tomato, and some of the crunchiest.. thickest.. juiciest bacon we've ever sunk our teeth into. We enjoyed the BLT to say the least. The plate came with two side options.. Ella went with the Wavy Lays.  Being the burger lover I am, I couldn't resist getting a Carolina Burger with chili, bacon, cole slaw, and.... BACON!!! Served on a toasted onion roll, this burger was freaking delicious. The bacon was crispy, and the the chili, mustard, cole slaw was unmistakably southern. Despite getting cole slaw on the burger, I felt I still had some appetite left for a side of creamy cole slaw.  Lupie's Cafe is the epitome of a neighborhood hangout.. a hole in the wall.. a dive.. or whatever you want to call it. Either way the food rocks and the place transmits a vibe that's pure and simple. If you're in the area and looking for some simple food at a cheap price, you gotta check out Lupie's Cafe.",

It definitely is a hole in the wall that has been around a long time so I guess there's something good about it that perhaps I haven't discovered yet. I tried the nachos, they weren't terrible. They are insanely big though, so plan to share. Others at the table tried various items but no one was very pleased with anything except maybe the mac n cheese and the green beans. The servers were pretty nice but don't think I have any interest in going back.",

    "text": "I am sad that I have lived close to Lupie's for more than a year and just in the last month discovered its awesomeness.  Lupie's may not have an extensive menu, but the things they have a done well.  And it's pretty cheap too.  This place looks like a total dive.  The outside is a little dated, and for that matter, so is the inside decor.  The inside looks kind of like a cabin, with wooden tables, benches, and even paneling on the wall.  For me, this place seems very down-home and inviting.  Our waitress was sweet as could be, and did a great job waiting on all the tables in the main area.  The first time I had Lupie's was for carry-out.  My partner was craving nachos, and I wanted a burger.  It was the closest place to get both of the things we wanted.  The nachos were covered in the choice of chili, and we chose the mild Southern Style.  The nachos were absolutely delicious!  I had a simple bacon cheeseburger, and the patty was very meaty and flavorful.  It was excellent and reasonably priced, and much better than many expensive, gourmet burgers I've had in this city.  The second trip, we decided to finally dine it.  Our waitress informed us they had just changed the menu that day, and you could now get chili mac over their macaroni and cheese.  Oh HECK yeah, I was sold!  They added even more cheese (kind of cheesy overload, but I like that sort of thing), onion, and beans to the Cincinnati chili, which was SO good!  My partner had the same thing with the Southern chili, and I have to admit that this was even better.  However, you may want to bring some Tums and/or Beano with you.  It is served with a large square of cornbread, which was also very delicious.  Cornbread tends to be a little sweet at most places, but not here.  It was a fabulous, moist, savory cornbread, which matched the chili mac perfectly.  To drink, we had sweet tea served in mason jars, which was some of the best tea I've had here in Charlotte.  And to top off the whole meal, we ordered the sweet potato kuchen for dessert.  I admit, I was a little hesitant about the dish when they brought it out completely covered in whipped cream.  But for me, it was love at first bite.  The cake was served hot, so the cream cooled it down at first and then kind of melted on the top.  The cake was so moist, with so much great sweet potato flavor, that it might be my new favorite sweet potato dessert.  For two dinners, two teas, and a dessert, our bill came out around $26 + tip, which was pretty inexpensive compared to a lot of places.  Our portions were so big, I think I only ate about 1/3 of my food.  Both my partner and I had plenty of leftovers to take back and eat later.  If you're looking for chili or a burger, I very highly recommend this place.  They had some great comfort food for really great prices.  Healthy it may not be, but delicious it is!  I have a feeling I will be dreaming of that kuchen for the next few days.",

Yes, it's a hole in the wall but you don't need to be fancy to have great food.  Lupie's menu consists of sandwiches, burgers, chili, veggies, quiches, and daily specials.  Looking for a starter, you can't go wrong with the nachos.  In fact, I've always thought they had the best nachos in town.  This time around I was a little disappointed with the chips used but they are thicker so they don't get soggy like thinner chips do.  Also went with the Chicken and Dumplings which was great but could have had a bit more chicken in it.   Otherwise, service was outstanding and you can't get a better bargain for the buck than at Lupie's.  Everything is inexpensive here and you get plenty!    As for alcohol it's bottled beer and a few selections of wine only here.  But as far as beer goes, they have several popular choices.   Thanks to Lupie for keeping this place going as long as it has been.  I look forward to future visits!",

As we walked in, one of the servers instantly said, \"Come on in and sit where you'd like.\" How great is that?!  We ordered the veggie chili, mac 'n cheese, and veggie soup. Just right for a chilly day and we left full. The special on Wednesday nights is spaghetti. I didn't have room for dessert, but the next time I'll try something.

They also just dumped a ton of sauce on them which made the breaded topping even mushier. Tried the wings and they were also at best luke warm.

I didn't get the beans or the spaghetti coz I wasn't that hungry.  It was a good portion of chili with plenty of cheese & onions.  I spooned some of the onions off.  It was really good.  It wasn't sweet at all, so I'm not sure what everyone is talking about.  It isn't spicy at all either which suits my tender taste buds to a tee!  It was yummy & thick and filling on a chilly, rainy day.  Speaking of tea... it is sweeeeeet!  I asked the waitress to cut it with some regular tea, which she kindly did & it was good.  My preference is if you're going to make tea that sweet it needs to be dark ... like coffee dark!    It's a split level set up which is interesting, but thank goodness it is.  When I came in the upper level which is where the entrance is was in a haze of -something-, so I sat in the lower area at the bar.  I think describing it as rustic would be stretching it, but dive would work well.  Not in a bad way either.  It's clean, the staff is friendly & the food comes fast & hot.    I'll definitely go again & try some more stuff when I'm more hungry!  p.s.  as I'm writing this I've finished off my take home dessert of Sweet Potato Kuchen!!!  Lupie's ROCKS this dessert!",

When we pulled up to the parking lot in the rear to lock up our bikes, there were big empty vegetable cans just sitting outside the back door, so it was clear that the vegetables were low quality. There was little to no seasoning and the chili we ordered was so greasy that the grease partially separated and coagulated on top of the food as it cooled. The mac and cheese was bland as was everything we ordered. To top off the experience, the service was terrible. The walls have signs that say \"no big parties\" and \"can't be sat without your whole party\". I was amazed that they could afford to turn anyone away. The waitress that greeted and sat us was short with us and offered nothing. The waitress that actually took out order (pink hair) was their ONLY redeeming quality. The cook came out to talk to someone at the table next to us; he was wearing torn up dirty clothes with holes all over his shirt, it gave me the impression that the kitchen was unsanitary (and I could give a crap what anyone wears but it was inappropriate for working in a restaurant and for diners to see this) and when I then looked back to the kitchen I saw that there were no gloves and the other cook tasted something with his fingers. I will never go back here.",

    "text": "This dive of an eatery came highly recommended on a recent trip to Charlotte for a concert at Bojangles' Coliseum. And unlike the concert venue, Lupie's did NOT disappoint! Since this place already has tons of reviews, I'll keep it short and sweet.  DECOR: This place is a dive, inside and out. But, that's part of what makes it great. Just don't judge a book by its cover.  FOOD: The nachos are killer (and huge) and the chilli mac is also great. Banana pudding is solid. I hear the Peach Kuchen is a must have dessert, but sadly we passed it up in favor of a free banana pudding. They have a decent beer selection, but could use more options.  SERVICE: Our waitress was great...very attentive. We were seated within minutes of walking in the door (I'm told there's often a line out the door, so we lucked out). Our food took longer than expected to come out, to which our waitress apologized and without missing a beat, gave us a free dessert to make up for it. +1 for customer service!  My only gripe is they serve chips instead of french fries. This I just don't get.  Finally in reply to one of the other reviews, yes, much of what you order here can easily be made at home. However, Lupie's does not bill itself as a high-end dining experience. There are definitely much better restaurants than Lupie's, but among the \"divey comfort food\" type of restaurants, Lupie's ranks highly. You don't go here to be wined and dined. You go here because you're hungry, are looking for a quick, comforting meal, and don't feel like cooking and cleaning up after yourself (not because you cannot cook).",

    "text": "This must be the place where Charlotteans who cannot cook go to eat. I cannot think of any other reason why this place is so highly reviewed. One of the reasons why I and millions of other people are willing to spend our hard-earned money at a restaurant is for the experience- to be served something that would have taken me much longer to prepare at home or something that I could never have made. I absolutely abhor these homemade \"restaurants\" for that reason.  Literally everything at Lupie's could have been made at home in a matter of minutes. Nothing is memorable or something that just has to be had at Lupie's. I had a burger with chips on the side. The burger was dry, as was the bun. The chips? Straight from a store-bought bag. Fries were not an option, nor was anything else homemade. They really should have taken the time to come up with some nice side, but instead opted for chips from a bag. That is even worse than those places that serve crinkle cut fries. If you want to do the homemade thing, at least do it right.  I will not be returning, but will remain confused and puzzled as to why people still frequent this place. Oh, well. That just means it will be easier to get reservations at proper restaurants.",

    "text": "Way behind on catchin up on reviews.  The great thing about Lupies is I could have written this review 20 years ago or today and it wouldnt change much at all......  This place is the classic dive...in a good way...Eating anywhere and everywhere throughot the world, if there is one thing I and my family have learned is you never judge a book by its cover.  Many times a 'dive', is where you will find some of the best food.  Lupies is a dive...a classic dive and staple in the area for many years. Every bit as good today as 20 years ago.....and looks the same today as 20 years ago.  If your in tattered blue jeans and a torn t-shirt, you are welcome....If your in a 3 piece suit, your just as welcome.  The decor is...well...the same as 20 years ago...it was a dive then and its a dive today. Many who have never been there may pass by take a look and decide they are better with a microwaved burrito at the closest 7-11 and avoid this place.  Big Mistake. Huge mistake.   Never judge a book by its cover. Lupies has been and still is highly rated in most rags covering good food. For Good reason. The food is simply terrific. Whether the regular menu or the daily specials, its great food, hearty portions at very reasonable prices.   While I love all they serve, my fav was and still is one of their several varieties of Chili Mac....Chili with spaghetti.....4 varieties, all different, all unique, all can be customized to your liking.  But be prepared....The portions are huge so plan on taking some home.  If you've been here you already know how good it is. If not and you see it, but pass on by cause it looks like a dive, you can kick yourself later. The food is simply great. The homemade chili. veggies, meatloaf etc...You just cant go wrong here. Not sure which chili you want, no prob, they will line up a sampling of all for you to taste.....  Terrific food....Do not come to charlotte and pass on this place.....Eat here once and you'll be eating here for years......Dont trust my review....Come here...trust your taste buds..they wont steer you wrong.",

    "text": "For more than 20 years I've been going to Lupie's and it's always been the same awesome, uniquely Charlottean joint with rocking food. They've made a few changes over the years but have remained True to their roots.  This is a casual, southern-boho place with friendly servers and a stated policy prohibiting business meetings. I love the photos of Queen City landmarks, some of which are long gone (including Independence Boulevard institutions Thompson's Bootery & Bloomery and the old Krispy Kreme). The stereo is usually playing something fantastic, mostly reggae, '80s alternative music, classic rock, and current indie rock. Basically, it's a laid-back, inexpensive place to unwind with good food.  I've never been to a better place for chili. For years their classic chili lineup was Texas, Cincinnati, and vegetarian. A couple of years ago they added Southern style, which is a good option for carnivores who don't want the Texas heat or Cincinnati sweetness. You can ask for a mix of chili varieties. A bowl of chili is filling; if you get chili mac you'll probably have leftovers.  The burgers are huge and delicious. Go ahead and ask for extra napkins when you order one.  Vegetarians have some good options: great vegetarian chili, a vegetarian burger, a vegetable plate, a garden salad. Often the quiche of the day is meat-free. If you crave nachos, try the Throw-Down Nachos with vegetarian chili. I honestly don't know if the vegetable soup is vegetarian.  This is possibly the sweetest sweet tea in town. It's served in a mason jar-style glass, which is fun and reminds me of glasses we had at home when I was a kid. Speaking of sweet things, the kuchen and the banana pudding are two of my favorite desserts in town!  There are daily specials, but I honestly don't usually order that unless I'm there on a Monday (meat loaf with mashed potatoes) or a Thursday (chicken and dumplings). The barbecue plate is great and so are the various sandwiches, but it's really all about the chili for me.",

The chicken dumplings are the favorite special of nearly every human who has walked out of the place. The burgers are fabulous, as is the spaghetti special.  Their mac 'n' cheese is among the best in the free world.    Probably the only thing I would change at Lupie's is the banana pudding -- banana pudding is served COLD, people.  Not warm.  And they will not seat you until ALL persons in your party are present.   Lupie's is a MUST VISIT eatery on your next trip to Charlotte.",

It certainly felt a little strange the first time we visited.  But after you accept that it is basically a pieced together shack, you can really enjoy the ambiance.    The bathrooms (especially the lower level women's) are a little gross. But they make up for it with the best chili in town.  Don't take that lightly, I love chili and am really picky about it!

Yes, it looks a little sketchy on the outside.  Yes, it's not in the best neighborhood.  Fortunately, it was still very light out when we went so I felt very safe and enjoyed the rustic ambiance of the restaurant.  I'm not sure how it gets once the sun goes down.    At 95 degrees outside, I wasn't really in the mood for hot chili, but I decided to give it a try since it was their specialty.  I ordered the chili mac (chili on top of spaghetti...all covered with cheese...c'mon, sing along with me!).  They have three types of chili (which I'm glad they explained on the menu).  Texas - no tomatoes, hot.  Cincinnati - regular tomatoey chili.  Vegetarian - guess.  I went with Texas.  It was VERY thick, full of meat, and yes, spicy.  YUM.    The portions are fantastically big; I walked out of there stuffed.  The prices are very reasonable, too, especially for the taste, quality, and portion size.  The table next to us ordered the covered/smothered nachos as an appetizer.  Wow.  It was a HUGE platter full.  I may have to try that next time as my main meal.

My friend's chicken and dumplings were pretty thick, too large of an order, she had to get a to-go box.  I like Lupie's and the funky atmosphere, I would return and order differently.",

    "text": "We had a great time at Lupie's tonight.  We originally were headed to The Diamond restaurant, but could not find a place to park the car.  So, we decided to try Lupies.  We hadn't been to Lupie's in a number of years.    There were three of us and we were seated immediately.  Just as quickly as we were seated our waiter arrived to see what we would like to drink.  He took our drink order and came back very quickly.  Roast Pork was the special tonight, but the waiter told us that they were out of the pork, but had chicken and dumplings.  I hadn't had their chicken and dumplings in quite a long time.  I had the chicken and dumplings and my wife had the chili and slaw hamburger.  (They can now cook your burger to your order- a big improvement.)  We were very happy with our choices.  They were delicious.  The only negative was that they are very generous with their portion size and I was reluctant to stop eating.  Shame on me!  However, it was so tasty I wasn't able to stop.    My compliments to the chef and their staff.  The food couldn't have been any better and the service was great.",

It's always fun to get my tea in the little jars.  I like how it is such a chill atmosphere with always good music in the background.    They have a rule that they will not seat a party until their whole party is there.  I like that so other people will not have to wait so long to get a table if a person from a party is running late.  Every time I take one of my friends there for a first time, they end up just loving the place and going back more and more.    BEST PLACE EVER!!!",

My buddy Vijay and I swung by for dinner last Tuesday. I was super bummed when I saw that the special the night before was meatloaf. However, it was my lucky day. They still had meatloaf left! Hip, hip... hooray! No mashed potatoes, though. Sigh, guess I have no choice but to eat delicious mac n cheese.   When in Rome, you have to get the chili. We couldn't decide which one to get. Our server suggested mixing two together. Brilliant. We went with Texas and Southern. Texas is on the spicy side. I liked the combo of the two. Vijay also got a burger. Holy. This thing was huge. I was shocked when he was able to eat the whole thing.   I have to get up here on a Thursday. Why? The special is chicken and dumplings. Sounds like the perfect meal on a chilly night. Not to be confused with chili....",

Which consisted of pintos, potato salad, and mac and cheese. Finally, I tried the Texas Chili and it was awful. It had way too much diced onions and I had remove one tablespoon full and included a triangular slice of cornbread. When my previous orders had a regular square shape cornbread. The mac and cheese was good but all items was cold. Only thing I enjoyed the most was the sweet tea. I will no longer order through Doordash from here. I had plans on dining in, forget it. Very disappointed... Bet there's a shortage of onions today.",

I love the idea of it and the staff is great, the food...not so much.  I've tried the burger, different kinds of chilis, salads, meatloaf, chicken n dumplings, various sides and Mac n cheese. The best being the meatloaf and the worst being a tie between the chicken n dumplings and the Mac n cheese. Unfortunately ordered in one trip. I don't understand how some of the reviewers find this to be the best Mac n cheese in charlotte. It tasted like off cheese and that was the only flavor it possessed. The chicken n dumplings were ridiculously thick with little sign of chicken and way too many pastey unappetizing dumplings.   Stick to the meatloaf which I think is only available on Mondays ( don't quote me on that) and the green beans and you might leave happy. I will probably be back since it's somewhere that my parents like to go. Perhaps then I will see what all the fuss is about.   Am I missing something?!",

I prefer their coarse chilis - Texas or Southern style. I keep mine basic - no toppings. I pair it with whatever daily side they have going that day and a piece of cornbread.  But Lupie's ringers are their daily specials and ever-changing daily sides. Friday is roasted pork day. Get it. Just trust me.  The place is definitely laid back and casual and the building isn't fancy, so check any haughtiness at the door. Actually, if you're haughty, don't bother coming because you don't deserve Lupie's awesomeness.",

Sometimes they will serve them up as a part of their Saturday rotation, but there are no guarantees.  I've also tried the chili, banana pudding, eclair pie (which is more like eclair pudding), quiche, green beans, etc.  I've yet to be disappointed.

I was so excited to show him this fun little dive full of yummy chili, burgers, hotdogs and other southern soul food items.   He loves places like this so I was hopeful that this would be his new spot!   I am sad to report that we both left pretty disappointed.  Maybe I hyped it up too much.  I mean it has been about 15 years since I was last there but wow...  We stuck with the basics....I ordered the Cincinatti chili and it was just not good.  Weird taste, no beans (although it says they are in there) and chopped up meat...like really chopped up.  The raw onions and sprinkle of cheddar cheese were my favorite parts.  The cornbread was drier than my grandma's skin.  Tasteless.  I couldn't even use it to dip in the chili because it was like a plastic, crumbly mess.  Husband ordered the chili dog and he was underwhelmed.  The greasy chips that came on the side were okay I guess??  Service was okay--they seem to try to hard to have that \"we're a cool dive in Charlotte\" vibe but it was okay.  Plus they recently opened one in Huntersville so that automatically takes away from the novelty of the place.  Eh--wouldn't feel compelled to come back but I'm sure there are other things on the menu that would make it worth the trip for others.  Price is right too.",

Fresh homemade food in generous portions, and a friendy staff make this one of my favorite places in Charlotte.",

It's a little off the beaten path and it's a fun down-home kind of place.",

They offer a daily special everyday that comes with 2 sides and sweet tea (usually about 5 or 6 dollars) and they also have a variety of sandwiches.  The best bet in my opinion is the veggie plate, which comes with cornbread and tea (only $4.85 for 4 veggies).  Don't miss the mac and cheese or the sweet tea, and for those of you that like blue cheese dressing- this is some of the best in town.  This place is decent sized and has a quick turn-over, but if you go during the lunch or dinner rush you might have to wait a little bit.",

I'd totally give this place a 5 stars, but not everyone will necessarily be a fan of the place and its still, so 4 is sufficient.  I absolutely love getting the veggie plate.  SO many options and in the summer even more!  I also have to get the Throw Down Nachos with vegetarian chili every once in a while.  Not for those on a diet, but every so many months the splurge is worth the wait!  Must order them in because they don't heat them as a to-go order; don't want the chips to go soggy.  They are very, very simple, but TERRIFIC!  My favorite special day is Thursday because the chicken-n-dumplings are about the best you can get outside of grandma's house (but MUCH better than anyone in my family and I'm from rural NC!).  I wouldn't go with a group over 6 because the seating will be iffy, but go!  My husband almost always gets the barbeque sandwich on a kaiser roll with mac-n-cheese.  He thinks its the bomb!  They have 4 different types of chili now-so try one.",

The chili was good, the mac n cheese was okay (I think I'll just take them separate from now on). The cornbread was really dry which ruined it a bit for me.  The fella ordered the chicken sandwich with coleslaw. He said the chicken was really tough, and he didn't clean his plate which tells me more than his words do.

My husband loves their beer choices!  I asked if we can have a little chili sampler and she brought it out for us. My favorite was the texas chili and vegetarian chili. I love spicy food and these two chilis definitely had a kick to it. We started out with the buffalo wings. Their buffalo flavor was nothing like I've had before and it was delicious. It was flavorful and spicy with a pepper taste to it. Wings were huge and juicy and their ranch really compliments it.   I got the chili mac with spaghetti noodles. I had it with a mix of texas chili and vegetarian chili. There was a large portion of spaghetti noodles topped with the chili and cheese and onions. It was absolutely delicious. Perfect for a chilly night. We will definitely go back. I'm gonna try either the spaghetti or chicken and dumplings next time. They do daily specials so check it out!",

Salad was iceberg lettuce with some diced tomatoes, but also served with very nice orange and Apple slices. Service is very good, atmosphere divey, food is mediocre.",

I had the Cincinnati chili all the way and it was tasty and kept me full the rest of the night. I was able to enjoy \"Wedding Crashers\" without worrying about an empty stomach.  Best of all, it was like $5. And there was a ton leftover. That made me wish I wasn't going to the movies afterward, as it would have made an excellent leftover meal the next day.",

    "text": "I would give Lupie's Cafe a solid three stars; 2 stars for unimpressive food and 4 stars for good service.  I'm pleased with my experience, but don't plan to return immediately.  For starters, the waitresses were sweet as pie (time to pull out the Southernisms) at this down-home, no-frills restaurant.  Our server was authentically friendly, making jokes about how the menu was conceived during the height of the Atkins diet craze-sandwiches without the buns and other no-carb nonsense.  During our meal, Another server made certain that we had drink refills as needed and offered dessert in case the server who took our order didn't.   The food was brought out promptly and covered the plate.  My first response was \"Holy Mackerel\" but soon turned to \"Meh\".  I ordered the barbecue plate with mac-n-cheese and green beans.  The portions were generous and I think the mac-n-cheese was the highlight of the meal.  The recipe was a knock-off of your granny's heartwarming (and artery-clogging) classic with a baked crust.  Mmmm. The barbeque was good but could have used more seasoning.  By BBQ, I mean Carolina-style minced pork minus the regional flavoring (mustard, vinegar, tomato).  The green beans were tasteless; actually they tasted like canned beans and the cornbread wasn't really worth my time.    I'm not entirely disappointed with Lupie's, but there was a lot to be desired.  The decor is funky and charmingly, the staff friendly, and food is approaching down-home goodness and flowing off the plate. I guess I need to give the touted chili or meatloaf a try.",

I love the tea in the big mason jars.  The service is casual but friendly. I often had conversations with the servers about my tattoos and got the invitation to take a look at theirs, which always makes for good dinner conversation.  When I first lived in Charlotte, I lived off of 7th Street, so I spent a lot of time at Lupie's. Now that I've moved across town, I don't make it over there as much.

The spaghetti was mediocre at best, very bland & unexciting with watery meat sauce (I think I could make it better and I've never made it) The sides were canned (not always an issue) but they were flavorless. Whoever posted about this place having fresh food is lying. I guess the atmosphere is attractive to some but I'm not a fan of restaurants that don't dust or clean. Sanitation rating 90.5 - not impressive. The place was packed, I guess this is the cool spot where all the \"hip\" people come. I just want good, quality food & to even begin to call this \"Southern\" food is a disgrace to my culture. My friend got the Southern chili & said it was the consistency of a Hormel chili, not great, not horrible. The cornbread he got was hard as a rock and was left uneaten after the first bite on the plate. The service was friendly & quick, that's about the only positive I experienced. I won't be rushing back to Lupies but since it is down the street from me I may try it again & see if it can get more than a 2 star rating. Keep in mind, I'm not a food snob but I know good food when I eat it & this was far from good...",

    "text": "short day at work due to a minor catastrophe so we wound up here while sorting through the rubble; cool and dark but not too dark with a nice blend of 70s and 80s power ballads and sing-alongs filling the empty room downstairs (the whole place was nearly full up a half hour later.) sat at the bar, draft lines still inoperative from some other malfunction but bottles and cans are available for the duration. after some idle banter and a couple tastes of chili (southern needs help from the green sauce) I'm nursing a cider waiting for the house's Texas Chili plus noodles, beans, onions, cheese, and a side of hotdog...  I was pleased by the portion size when it arrived: a generous serving of chili-enhanced spaghettis plus a 3x3 square of cornbreads accompanied by a very respectable sausage on a split roll slathered in chili with a tangy pickle spear along side for kicks. Alas, today's cornbread was forgettable, bland and without corny bits but otherwise still fit for consumption... could be a fan of the chilimac though: bunch of long, fat noodles add some substance to the bowl, beans and onions give some depth to the chili helping to accommodate a blast of the red that heats it all up nicely.",

    "text": "Yet another visit to Lupie's, my longest running favorite dive in town!  I just can't help but ordering the same thing each and every time...Chili Mac with Texas Chili (minus Onions & Beans, plus extra Cheese), Corn on the side, and \"Kuchen\". Am seriously addicted to them all...and as usual, they were perfectly satisfying! Still, I have yet to find a better Chili Mac anywhere else in the U.S. BTW, although he won't admit it, my hubby is addicted to their Nachos with Texas Chili.   Once again, am stopping from giving all 5 stars because of the horrific overhead music. Like I mentioned in my previous review, the music here is quite inconsistent...some times better than other times, and the genre is always random. Tonight, however, it was the worst. Have no clue WHAT it was they were playing?? Not only bad, but the music was downright irritating. I can only hope they can improve the overhead selection in the future?  All that said, nothing can keep me from coming back for more of that Chili Mac...and Corn...and \"Kuchen\"! All just HEAVENLY. Like I told my hubby tonight, this has to be the biggest dive that I actually love! I do wonder what their sanitation grade may be...Anyone know? Well, don't think even a low score may prevent me from returning!",

    "text": "This has been on my list for quite some time so when we got back late on New Year's from holiday travels and didn't have time to go grocery shopping for the week, we decided to try this for dinner the next night.   Since they're known for their chili, we had to get it. They have 4 different kinds: Cincinnati, Texas, Vegetarian, and Southern. I really wanted to try them all in some kind of chili flight but there was no option for that.   We decided to try 3: Cincinnati with spaghetti, Texas with mac and cheese, and a cup of Southern. Both of us agreed that the Texas was by far the best, followed by the Cincinnati, and we did not like the Southern. The Texas was spicy and delicious with great flavor. It went great with the mac and cheese. My husband loves Skyline chili (from Cincinnati). We knew it wouldn't be the same, but judging it on it's own instead of comparing, it didn't quite do it for me. It was lacking a bit of flavor. I couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about the Southern, but there was some flavor that neither of us liked at all.   All of them came with cornbread. I don't need my cornbread to be sweet, but this cornbread was very dry and lacking flavor.   You get a ton of food for the price. We mostly didn't eat the cup of chili we got since we didn't like it and both left stuffed.   It's a table service restaurant, but it's incredibly fast. They took our order and had our food out in less than 10 minutes. Once you're done eating you pay at the register.   I will say on the service side, our waiter was not very helpful with recommendations. We were trying to ask for recommendations on chili types and what would go best together and he didn't give us any help.   All in all, the food was cheap, fast, and some of it was quite tasty. I would come back again for the Texas chili but probably not anything else.",

Love the variety of chili's to try, and also the variety of ways to try them - on top of spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, etc.  just a bowl is perfect enough for me, and is served to your liking with toppings and corn bread.   For the nine chili eaters, they also have a variety of other things to try as well.  But I definitely recommend you try a chili!",

Our group of three ordered the Chili Mac and the Cincinnati Throw Down Nachos.... 15 minutes later nachos without any [Cincinnati] chili on them, and no chili Mac arrived at all. Told staff that delivered the food, and the waitress returned and did a nice job of quickly writing down what was missing. Only the Chili Mac then arrived.  Normally we'd order the amazing Peach Kuchen to enjoy at home later but skipped it and hope for a better/normal experience next time.  If next time is at all better, I'll post an update and remove this one entirely.",

The quick service and reasonable prices could not, unfortunately, overcome the just OK flavors.    Each time I visit a Lupie's I want the food to match the ambience,  but it typically falls flat for me.  I did think the mac-n-cheese was good and was the most flavor-filled item on the plate.   The green beans I cry foul, however . . . straight outta the can.  Many people rave about Lupie's, so \"Give 'em a whirl\" and see if you  become an ardent fan standing in line for a seat.",

They have four different chili's to pick from, and the texas red is not only delicious but HOT, just like it says on the menu, and try it on an onion roll, you won't regret it.  My wife has been coming here since the 90's and she said it's always been exactly the same as she remembers.  It's great to see a place that has a special style that doesn't change, because it makes it more of a destination than just another restaurant.  And you really can't beat the prices, you can get in and out for a little more than $10 each and that's including beers!  I'm so hooked on the chili burger, it's been the only thing I've had, except for dessert.  You have to try the kuchen, it is a simple and delicious fruit pie covered with whipped cream, fantastic.",

The best thing about Lupie's is nothing is fried and they have home cooked daily specials. The chicken and dumplings, fettuccine Alfredo, quiche, vegetables, etc. are always a good choice.  My usual go to is the burger, chef salad or wings. It depends on my food mood, but I've never been disappointed in a dish here! The sweet tea is plentiful and if you're a beer person, you can enjoy a Gee Whiz for $1 (PBR...but hey, it's a buck!)  This trip, I ordered the BBQ wings. The meat was so tender it fell of the bone. I couldn't detect any seasoning in the meat itself, but the sauce was smoky and sweet. The ranch for dipping pairs very nicely and balances the overall flavor. It also is homemade, not a food service ranch product.   Desserts are also really tasty. The brownies and kuchen are my favorites.",

Today, since I was in the area, I decided to try it out. Although the tea was good, this place was not my cup of it.   Today I ordered the Lupie's chilli slaw burger with the mac and cheese as a side. I saw many pictures of the mac and cheese and thought it looked delicious. So for me this was a no-brainer. After tasting the burger, I must say that this was probably one of the blandest burgers I've had in a very long time. Perhaps, I've been spoiled by going to some of the top burger joints in town. But I did not enjoy my burger at all. Other than being bland, the bun tasted a bit off, the meat was not soft and juicy.   The mac and cheese looked as it looked in the pictures. Beautiful. After taking my first bite, I was highly disappointed. It tasted as if it was merely boiled noodles with cheese that was melted on top of it. It was not mixed in very well at all. Worst of all, it tasted bland as well. I added some salt and it helped a little bit, but I very rarely add extra salt to my meals.   The tea was delicious. Other than the service, it was the only thing I truly enjoyed. But since this isn't a tea shop, I can't base my meal off of the taste of the drink. Perhaps, I should have tried the nachos instead because they looked great (but then again, so did the mac and cheese).   All in all, I was disappointed in my meal today. I can at least say I got the opportunity to try Lupie's Cafe out today. I thank the staff for wonderful service but I will most likely not be back.",

Service was great and portions were generous. I had a yummy hot dog and husband got the wings (which were too hot for me but he said were GREAT!!). I can definitely see why it's a favorite of Charlotte diners.  Was going to take a pic of the food but dove into it as soon as it came and it was mostly gone before I remembered I had wanted to take photos LOL oh well next time  :)",

From what I saw everything on the menu was very reasonably priced, but you also get your money's worth with gargantuan portion sizes. I was quite full after eating half of my BBQ platter... which was very tasty, by the way.  The service was so-so. Our server seemed kind of rushed, but he wasn't bad. The Mac and Cheese here was pretty awesome. So many people try to do Mac and Cheese, and despite it being such a simple dish I've never had this side done as well as they did it as this restaurant.",

    "text": "Since I'm a NC native, I'm going to take a few liberties. Strike that. Since I'm a UNC grad, I'll take lots of liberties. For my fellow Tarheels, you'll know exactly what I mean.  Lupies is the He's Not Here of food in Charlotte. End of review.  Just kidding. I wouldn't respect myself in the morning if I let the metaphor slide by those of you not familiar with Chapel Hill.  He's Not Here is (or was- is it still there?) a watering hole familiar and dearly loved by undergraduates. The beer was cheap, the music was loud, and the crowd often raucous beyond belief. You'd go to He's Not Here to howl at the moon- or whatever. He's Not Here was not the most consistent place, sometimes your beer would be so hot-off-the-tap it would be... hot. The burgers and fries were good or not good- depending on the day, size of crowd or size of hangover the cook or you were nursing.   You'd go to He's Not Here for what it DID have- attitude, history, and a sense of place.  That's Lupie's in a nutshell. I've been to Lupie's and had a delicious burger. I've been to Lupie's and had a mediocre burger. The service, while not always stellar, has usually tended to the casual, if not pleasant. And yes, most times Lupie herself is somewhere near the register.  People like Lupie's because they know Lupie's. Not only that, they know Lupie, the owner who started this establishment over 20 years ago, when its location not only put it on the edge of the 'hood, it was IN the 'hood. Heck, by any standard, 20 years in the restaurant business is like being there at the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  So it is with Lupies. Don't go expecting much, and if you leave pleasantly surprised, which you probably will, you'll come back.  Note: I once heard Lupie's squash casserole mentioned on Jane and Michael Stern's Road Food segment on NPR. It's sort of like having the Jack Kerouac stamp of approval.",

Side of canned green beans, really canned??  And mac and cheese was okay.  Corn bread was not good, really dry and my sisters piece had hair in it.

I am not a fan of their veggie burger or their vegetarian chili, but they normally have fresh & delish veggie plates - with super mac-n-cheese. I like their cornbread too. On Thursdays you can get home-style chicken & dumplings - which for a native southerner like me is True comfort food. Oh, and don't forget to save room for the banana pudding!",

If you're veg and ordering nachos, remember to get them with their veggie chili instead of beans-- yes, there's lard in them beans. Chili \"salad\" is hilarious and awesome, I've only had the restraint to order quiche here once, and found it simple but tasty.

They have a wide variety to choose from that range from sweet to spicy, mild to \"oh-my-god-I'm-dying\"and you can get it in a bowl or piled on top of just about anything.

I think there's a lot of history here, it reminds of those cool, local places the natives take you when you're visiting their turf. Like those 90's hungouts where the cool kids hung out before or after shows. Either way, I don't know much about the history of Lupie's. The building is awesome, the front doors are probably as old as the building and the aging on the walls gives it a lot of appeal.   The staff was very friendly and serviceable.  My daughters ordered a burger and a BLT and both were very, pleased with their order. Girl #1 ordered just a regular burger and said it was one of the better burgers she's had recently. Oddly enough, Lupie's doesn't have a kid's menu. I don't think I've seen an eatery without a kid's menu in quite some time.  I ordered the nachos.... yeah, not the brightest idea. I wish the waitress would have give me a heads up about the size. To put it in perspective, you can feed half the population of Peru with a single order of nachos from Lupies. Half of my portion is still sitting in my refrigerator... crap, that reminds me, I gotta go throw them out now, they're several days old. The nachos were very, very standard. Cheese, beans, and jalapenos over chips. I could have made them at home and they would have been just as good,  The food is ok, nothing to write home about. I didn't particularly like it or dislike it. So, it's pretty safe to say that if I'm in the area again, I'll probably end up there.",

    "text": "This review written by my 11yr old niece Emily - my comments at the end.   \"Hello people this is my uncle's account thingy for yelp but he let me write a review for him so here is my review for the famed Lupie's! Well portions are great and so is the service and the food. Is  very reasonably priced. The only thing that I didn't really like was my desert kuchen it's way to sweet (but I almost ate the whole thing by myself). In all I had a great experience and I would recommend this restaurant. The end\"  My account Pros - Great hole in the wall place to try North Carolina comfort food. Daily specials.  - Tried: Burger, Gumbo, BBQ wings, chicken with dumplings, throw down nachos, quiche, cobbler dessert (Kuchen?). - Desert was very tasty & sweet - my niece almost finished the whole thing by herself! - Great service - the servers were great. They even let us sample the 4 types of chili to help our final decision. - Rear parking - plenty of seating inside - nicely appointed w/comfortable setting.  Cons - Looks like it gets crowded here on weekdays. We stopped by on Sat (opens @ noon) - by the time we were leaving the back lot was full.  Return Visit - Yes - next time I'm in town.",

It's hard not to give this place a four stars, however the only vegan food the have is chili and it isn't really worth eating (unless you're really hungry). Also their beer selection could improve a bit.  That being said, the prices are good and the omnivores tell me their other menu items are pretty good. I live in walking distance to Lupie's and it's nice to be able to stroll on over and have a couple drinks. The place is just so calm and relaxed feeling.",

For example, the spaghetti was quite soggy, the sauce was very bland and the overall taste and texture wasn't much better than opening a can of tomato sauce and pouring it over well cooked noodles.  However, the chili has been consistently good.    Service can be pretty slow, particularly at busy times.  At lunch prepare for a long wait even to order.  And an even longer wait to get your food.  The staff can vary from looking and acting like they just got out on work release to being pleasant and helpful.  Usually I find them to be on the less friendly and helpful side.    In short, I'm not a professional chef but I can slay their cooking in most dishes.  Portions are slim (chili) to moderate (except for nachos) so don't come too hungry.  And plan for a real dive atmosphere with service to match.",

Nice and simple menu with a couple choices of burgers and a few different kinds of chili. Let me say, the chili is what will keep you coming back. The choices are variations of Cincinnati, Southern and Texas style Chili. All have their strong points and are even good when mixed together. The only one I can't truly appreciate is the Cincinnati style. Sweetness in my chili is just a bit weird as a dyed in the wool southerner.   Sweet tea. You've gotta get Lupie's sweet tea. Sweetened to perfection and they give it to you in a mason jar with the best crushed ice in the world. A perfect pairing for your chili of choice.   The burgers are great, too. I haven't ventured into the world of burgers too much, but what I've had has been memorable.   The parking lot can be a little tricky. If you're going at peak lunch hours, good luck. It's a bit cutthroat to find a space. Also, getting back out on to Monroe can be a bit of a challenge, so beware.   This place is awesome. Love it for lunch or a date night with my wife. Actually went to this place with wife the night we decided to get married! Such a great memory.   Keep doing exactly what you've been doing all these years, Lupies.   Perfect.",

    "text": "One of the joys of having non-foodie friends is that you can introduce them to the goodness awaiting them in their home city. So it was when I visited a friend of mine who'd lived in the Charlotte area most of her thirty-some years but had never heard of Lupie's Cafe when I said that I wanted to go there. As it turned out, Lupie's is right near the college she attended ... and she never knew it was there.  Lupie's is located in a borderline run-down section of Charlotte, the building a bit on the ramshackle side both inside and out. But the parking lot is full and the place is packed, with cheerful waitresses bustling about delivering mouthwatering-looking food. My friend ordered a cheeseburger while our other friend ordered the vegetarian chili--she was looking at the Cincinnati chili but she'd never had it before and as it's an acquired taste I steered her away. I went for a hot dog topped with Texas-style chili and coleslaw, and we all got macaroni and cheese for our sides.  I'm usually not a fan of baked mac and cheese but I will make a very large exception for Lupie's version. It is extremely creamy and rich and well-seasoned, with just a little top chewiness... carb heaven. The chili-slaw dog was dressed perfectly, the coleslaw providing a nice chill against the authentic heat of the chili. My friends raved about their food choices and the sweet tea served in Mason jars. Not being a fan of tea I went with the other house wine of the South, Dr Pepper, also served in a jar.  The best part was that the three of us ate and drank extremely well for around twenty bucks. Lupie herself mans the cash register, and she beamed with pride when we babbled about how awesome the food had been. She's probably used to that reaction by now.",

Thumbs up for having vegetarian chili, veggie burgers, and vegetarian quiche. They also usually have a selection of sides to make a veg. plate too. The ONLY reason I don't give Lupie's more stars is the lack of selection, they've pretty much had the same menu for like 20 years... but extra kudos for being locally owned and operated!  If you have room for dessert, make sure you try the PEACH KUCHEN! This dish is outta control amazing! It's in my top three favorite desserts of all time. Sort of like a German peach cobbler I think?",

After reading all the rave reviews, I had to try this little gem for myself.   We drove into the mostly empty gravel lot, and jogged past two workers who were smoking out back in the rain. I was excited because of everything I'd heard and could hardly contain myself as I stormed in through the doors. Tip for you high heel wearin ladies... running in gravel is never a good idea, no matter how hungry you are. When you get inside, there are two separate areas, and it looks like it could be a fun time on a weekend.   We got our menus, she told us the special and we browsed over the selection. I was bummed that chicken & dumplings was only on certain days. I moved here from Cincinnati, OH and was pleased to see \"Cincinatti\" chili on the list. I haven't been gone from my hometown for long though, so I didn't try the reminder of days past.   I can't remember what I even ordered, but my boyfriend got the spaghetti and it was extremely soggy. When we packed it up, the water drained out of the side and into my lap. Not a pleasant ride home I must say. I know I'll get something thrown at me for saying this, but honestly I was expecting a little more... I know, I know, I'm sorry Charlotteans, but I wasn't that impressed.   The staff was nice though, and it was very laid back. I'd go back and give it a second try. Maybe I'll get the chicken and dumplings the next time around :)",

However, my opinion was quite easily swayed. This place has got four (?) different kinds of chili, one of which is vegetarian! My husband got a cheeseburger with the Texas variety of chili on it and I got nachos with veggie chili. I had no idea I would get enough nachos to feed a family for $8, but I did! And they were delicious. I mean it. I've had a lot of nachos but these top the list. Plenty to bring home and enjoy later. The only cons I can think of for this place would be the location and the menu could be a little more diverse. However, it is a Charlotte tradition and they definitely have a specialty so more items may ruin the good stuff. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Back in the day this place was awesome. Now, I won't eat there again. The wings were a slimy disgusting mess and the chicken salad tasted rancid. I love the bldg and the fact that it's been a part of this city for a long time, but it hasn't been kept up. The carpet REALLY needs to be replaced. The whole place just seems dirty and just makes me think there's a ton of roaches.... I can't speak for the chili but even the mac and cheese just isn't the same anymore. I miss the Lupie's from way back in the day. Now, I'm just scared to eat there.",

I have a habit of ordering whatever quiche is on special for that day and my boyfriend raves over Tuesday's special the chicken casserole. We have never gotten an unfriendly waiter or waitress and keep coming back because of the consistency.",

    "text": "Before you order look around at the place if you do go there. Everything is decrepit. Zero maintenance in the serving area does not bode well for the kitchen. Pealing paint on the ceiling from water damage eventually end up in food. I was hoping all the time I was there that the dust coated ceiling fans would not be turned on. If a friend had not brought me there I would have walked out immediately. I was not impressed with the service,as I shuddered at the surroundings. The bathroom was poorly maintained and looked like it had not been cleaned for weeks. (Months?). So I wondered about kitchen cleaning and maintenance. If hygiene is not a big deal with you you may like this place. The chili was hot and good, while the burgher was cold and meh. No way do I go back.",

    "text": "Lupie's is perfect for the long day when only comfort food and sweet tea will suffice. Their Texas chili has the perfect amount of heat, teetering on the edge of sweat-inducing. Upgrade to the chili mac and you're staring a day's worth of caloric intake in one dish, but man it's worth it. Their sides, especially the mac and cheese are creamy and buttery, and just about as good as Grandma used to make too.   Just about everything I've had at Lupie's was tasty. I thought their cornbread was a little bland, but that's a huge nitpick considering how much they get right. If you want some delicious, well-priced comfort food, this unassuming place on Monroe Road is worth every dollar and every bite.",

    "text": "What a great dive. If you don't know to look for it, you'll drive right past.   I've really only partaken of the vegetarian chili and chili mac variation, and it's just the perfect thing on a cold day when hunger is calling and I don't have time to make a slow-cooked, long-term commitment to cooking. Apparently there are lots of other wonderful things on the menu, but I've found my old faithful dish and there's no looking back for this girl.  Once you receive your food, prepare to have the check dropped off at your table, and go pay at the register/kitchen area. Bring cash to tip your server, or consent to being charged extra on the card. Not a problem, but definitely an old-school way of doing things.  As for the ambiance, again, it's a dive. But happily so. It didn't become one on accident. And it's the kind of place you need to try, just to say you've been. It's definitely a Charlotte staple, and is nestled fondly in the hearts of QC residents.",

Their chilies are all fairly good on their own but I was not impressed with anything else. As far as presentation, if you've ever been to Rochester, their dishes look a lot like the famous garbage plates served in Nick Tahou's restaurant.  As far as the taste, we ordered chicken wings and saw the cooks grab them out of the fridge and microwave them. The result were wings that were mushy on the outside and were insanely hot and overcooked on the inside. Who knows when the wings were actually cooked.  Another time we went I ordered their chicken and dumplings and sadly it tasted like flour and water with a few bits of chicken thrown in.  Go to Lupie's for a bowl of chili and a beer but I can't recommend anything else.",
