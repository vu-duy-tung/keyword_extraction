The service was not too bad either, but this is a place you visit for the good food. I had the rotisserie chicken which was very good, and the mixed rice (moro de gandules), and I definitely enjoyed it. They lost abstar because my tamarind juice was bottled and not all natural, and also because my wife asked for salami and got fried ham instead. What was that about? We may be back as the food was good.",

The passion fruit juice was the absolute best. I had 2 cups and wanted more. My husband had curry chicken, arroz con gandules and broccoli. I thought the food prices were reasonable ($10.99 for the goat meal and $7.99 for the curry chicken). The passion fruit juice was a little pricey at $2.25 each but there are free refills and it was worth every penny. The food is served from a buffet so it wasn't piping hot, but not did it taste like it had been sitting there all day. There was a nice variety of food to choose from and we look forward to coming back in the future",

They also have a buffet of Dominican soul food which looks really good. The food is said to be halal but I couldn't verify if it was hand slaughtered zabiha. Also there wasn't really anything special about the fries... So that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Other than that the owner is really nice and sweet. Chef tony is also really accommodating and gracious and he'll customize you're order if there isn't a long wait.",

Would never have imagined to find a halal Dominican restaurant near downtown Charlotte while road tripping , but so glad we came here .   You can Create your own combinations of a variety of dishes so the possibilities are your choice . We chose the lamb over white rice - SO GOOD! I personally think this was better than the famous Halal Guys Cart in NYC 10x better , and the sauce was soo tasty . Def recommend . Also got the Jerk Chicken - soo tender and juicy and great taste ; had that with the vegetable rice and cabbage .  Got a order or fried chicken to go - perfectly cooked . They also have a variety of fresh juices . I got a carrot juice - tasted exactly how it's supposed to.  Wish we would have gotten more things to try because they have a ton of meat dishes but were soo full from everything , and definitely going to come back thru!   The also have free Qurans for you to take  , which just made me love this place even more   Overall great place , quick and friendly service!",

Despite being in a sketchy Strip mall, the place is always clean and well-kept. Their employee turnover seems high and your portion size is very employee dependent. Portion sizes have gone down since their opening and the prices charged are not always consistent with what's on the menu. I asked for a side of Bacalao when the menu clearly states a side of meat is $3.99 The employee stated that the owner says it is now $6.99 for an additional meat. My last few visits I noticed a careful rationing out of food and the fact that portion sizes are becoming smaller and smaller. Disappointing...",

After moving jobs to south Charlotte, I found myself craving the delicious chicken over rice almost daily.  I had heard they do it similar at the physical restaurant, but I had never actually tried it.     Bottom line, it's spot on and it's delicious.  The portion actually might be bigger and the price is the same.   Their chicken over rice combo is one of my favorite dishes in Charlotte, and now I can get my fix without going to uptown.",

I went with the Lamb Gyro combo. Pros were this was only 5.99 ant portion size was large. Plenty of crinkle cut fries which is always a plus for me and the gyro was loaded with lamb meat.  It comes with a canned soda as well so for price you can't beat it.  I would no be able to do fast food for this cost. Service was great and soon as I walked up to the counter the friendly staff was willing to help. I placed my order, had a seat and soon the staff delivered my gyro to the table. I would say the negative for me was the lamb was chopped and my review is swayed more to the order. Even with the large portion size I would prefer thick slices of lamb. It was decent but not the gyro I was looking for and it has been an while since I had a lamb gyro.  All that said, if in the area I would venture back and perhaps try something else on their large menu. I mean they have oxtail. I should have gone with that or the jerk chicken.",

All she kept saying was that thru don't have it and she didn't know what that was. So I asked someone else and they gave me the same puzzling look. I had to take a picture of the menu and point it to them cause apparently my Spanish wasn't working. She still had no idea as I was pointing at the menu and then I asked if she's Dominican. She says no and then I asked is anyone who works here is Dominican and she said no.?!? That makes no sense how are you a Dominican restaurant and not one person working here is Dominican?!

Walk in at 11:30 1/2 an hour into lunch service and tell the girls I'd like the chicken/lamb combo over rice, they said it wasn't ready and I'd have to wait 10 minutes. I thought, sure no problem, I really wanted the combo and I needed to stop by the Asian Supermarket across the street real quick anyway so left and came back 15 minutes later.  11:45 \"Still not ready, just take a seat and we'll be with you soon.\" At this point I'm still the only one in the restaurant minus the two girls behind the counter. I've already invested 15 minutes, what's a couple more?   12:00 I'm asking how long because I've got to be in Monroe very soon. They had served 3 other customers ahead of me because they were ordering rotisserie or jerk chicken, they told me to come up and choose my rice. They then gave me my drink and said the meat would be ready in just a second. I also decided on a side of plantains for $1.99 since I had been staring at them for while now. They rang me up and I sat back down.   12:10 finally walking out the door... I feel like they only had me come up and choose my rice and pay so that I wouldn't leave. I wish I had. But I received the food so finally, time to see if it was worth the wait.  Meat was good, a little dry, not as moist as the cart in Uptown. Lettuce and Tomato were fresh, tomatoes were great. The rice was notably bland, I don't understand how the rice at the cart has a mellow, complex spice and aroma to it and at the restaurant it literally has nothing to offer. The plantains were simply burnt, not blackened with spices, burnt. Trust me, I know plantains.  It was also more expensive than Uptown. It 'appears' that you're getting more food than the cart but it's just more bland rice and less meat. Not a great trade off.  Service was nothing to speak of. No apology for the wait, and no interaction at all the entire time I waited, even though for most of the time I was the only patron at the place. They have zero customer service awareness.  Take my advice, go to the cart at Trade and Tryon. They can handle 5 times the amount of customers in a third of the time with better food. Chris and his team up there are just so much better, if the food wasn't great and his team so friendly, this visit would probably be the end. 2 Stars because apparently the food is the same, but what a bummer today's visit was...",

They paid the same amount but their plates had twice the content mines did. This happened multiple times,  which meant I didn't get what I paid for.  If you're giving one patron more food than the others when both are paying the same price, it create inconsistency.  Inconsistencies are never good for a brand because it breeds contempt.
