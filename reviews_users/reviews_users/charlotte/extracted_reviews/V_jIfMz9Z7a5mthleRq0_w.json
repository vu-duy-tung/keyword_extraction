The curries are each uniquely flavored and they don't taste too salty. The staff is friendly and the customers lined up waiting to be served always seem to be in a pleasant mood for some reason. (Nirvana II is take-out only.)  I've been eating Indian food regularly since the first Indira Gandhi administration. I've gotten to be a pretty good Indian chef myself -- like when I boil a pouch of Haldiram's yellow dal for 5 minutes and pour the contents over made-from-scratch basmati rice. But when I want to raise the bar a few notches, I head over to Nirvana II.",

The spice thing is a big peccadillo of mine because most of these lunch spots really turn down not just the heat but overall flavor to suit the typical business lunch crowd. Nirvana II don't compromise as nearly as much and their food is adequately flavorful.   The menu also rotates regularly so you never get too bored of what's available. Still i mostly go there on Fridays when they have their fish curry which i'm rather partial to.",

It's pretty much a \"to-go\" type of establishment, but they do have a few tables out front.  I usually try to eat this stuff outside as the aroma is way too strong for the office.  I don't want to make my co-workers too jealous!  I usually stick to the vegetarian options (it's cheaper and you can get a lot more food for the price), but everything I've had has been delicious.  Indian food just has that 'POP', and Nirvana delivers it at a good value.  Yes, the naan is just pita bread as others have mentioned, but it's still good.  Make sure you also know your limit when it comes to spicy food because they usually have 1-2 entrees that deliver a big kick.  They'll let you know if you ask.  Bottom line, it's a tasty, cheap, and quick lunch Uptown.  I just have to watch it because sometimes I want to curl up under my desk and take a nap after chowing down!",

The food is completely bland, the tikka masala is a weird dark brown color versus the delicious tomato sauce color that I had come to expect from this place, it tasted canned, the potatoes in the potato and okra curry tasted frozen - not fresh at all... overall, just SO disappointing.    I used to go to this restaurant at least once a week... now I don't know if I will ever be back.  Tears have been shed over this... and based on the fact that I used to have to wait 10 minutes to order at this place and this time I just walked right up to the counter - it is pretty clear that I am not the only uptown worker who shares this disappointment.

Today, they had fish curry, aloo channa, dal tarka, chicken biryani, malai veggies,and coconut chicken. If they have rice pilaf available that day instead of just rice, pay the extra quarter and get it. If you are unsure whether you will like a dish, ask for a taste before you order it. They are happy to accommodate.   Chai is sporadically available and my coworkers swear by it, though I find it too sweet. Occasionally, they will have a dessert available - get it!

    "text": "I have been on quite the Indian binge lately, making it myself at home, trying everything pre packaged from Trader Joes and then a Groupon came out for Nirvana II. I only bought two meals worth knowing I should have purchased more and I really should have.   I never go Uptown so my first trip to Nirvana was anything but \"Nirvana\". I wasted most my lunch break roaming around uptown, now on foot looking for the restaurant. It is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd, not really S Tryon, which is probably what caused all my confusion.   But alas I made it! For my first trip I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. The Chicken was awesome, the tikka masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy.   I went again today ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala again, the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but my stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately, hope that passes.The sides were Aloo Bhindi (potato/okra), Navratan Korma and I got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars, I swear it was pushing five pounds of food. I should have weighed it once I got back to the office. The chicken once again was great, korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made it stand out. But the aloo bhindi is what I was excited about the most. I had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east, probably because my mid western GF had never heard of it. It was very good, almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant/potato curry but not as spicy.  For someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently I mean six months, I enjoyed Nirvana II. Sure it's the first Indian restaurant I have ever dined at (Woodlands I am looking at you next) but I think eight dollars, ten with the Mango Lassi for more food than I can eat in one sitting is a great deal. I will definitely return with or without a Groupon.",

The FIRST thing I asked upon entering was if the new owner was affiliated with the previous one and the nice man said no!  Phew!!  This is a takeout Indian spot - they have several different dishes to choose from (I think they are only open for lunch?  I am not sure....).    I had the Chicken Tikka Masala yesterday and it was mild - perfect for this inexperienced Indian-Food-Loving palette.  The beautiful rice was plentiful and the nice chef also gave us free tastes of anything we wanted to try.    The nan was the only letdown.  It seemed prepackaged, as in not freshly made.  But the rest of the food and yogurt sauce was delicious.  I got my food plus a bottle of water for $7 bucks.  Can't wait to get back here!  So glad it is convenient for us uptown workers!!!  :-D",

    "text": "I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with the prior review on this one.  I was initially excited to hear about the opening of this new Indian Fusion restaurant as it's right next to where I work and I love South Asian food. The concept was new, interesting, and unique. The prices were incredibly low and the pictures on the outside looked pretty good. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed when a bunch of buddies and I went to finally try it out (we all happen to be brown by the way).   I can appreciate the fact that the food isn't supposed to taste exactly like Indian cuisine as it has culinary influence from several different areas of the world. But what I personally found was that the flavors and textures of the dishes they offered were as uninviting and bland as the yellow interiors of the actual establishment. We tried the red beans, the chicken korma, a couple of wraps, eggplant, and another chicken dish and somehow I couldn't even finish my food. Maybe it's just my bias since I grew up with this type of cuisine, but I'm not gonna pretend that I would even consider coming here again.  To put it briefly, you get exactly what you pay for. For $5 at lunch time, you're going to get $2 quality chicken, $1 quality rice, $2 quality taste. It's like waiting in line at the school cafeteria. In the back of your mind, you're hoping for something good today, but ultimately you end up wishing you hadn't even made the effort to get in line.  You can tell that some of the flavors are there in terms of identifying it as coming from a certain part of Asia, but you won't find the boldness or adequate seasoning in any of the dishes. The wraps were of course leaking everywhere because they put the actual chicken IN it's gravy into the tortilla. Not a clever move.  I was also charged $76 because she \"pressed the numbers too quickly.\" Hopefully the void shows up in my statements, otherwise I had an unbearably overpriced lunch....  I suppose if you've never had Indian food in your life, this might pass as edible.  2/5",

    "text": "The first time I heard about Nirvana 2 was from a colleague of mine who loves Indian cuisine. Now growing up in a family of Indian chefs and doing my own Indian cooking there was only one restaurant that I like to visit and that was the Rajbhoj in the university area. When  I first went to check out Nirvana 2 I was pleasantly surprised to see that the owner was also a chef at Lolas making the lolas beef tips. If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips it is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine.  Now about Nirvana 2;- it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part. What the reader Avi A said about the food being bland;- any lentils or korma will always have some blandness associated for it. If you want something with a flavor and a kick here are some options;-  Chilli chicken Pepper Chicken Any south Indian chicken Curry fish - Yes this is really good  For you non vegetarians;-  Chama masalla Any peas and mushroom combinations Any kadai combinations  The coconut chicken is also good but dont expect it to be spicy.  The staff is very friendly and they do take feedback. So if you have to say something tell them. It will only help improve their cusine. My mama always told me that if you dont have something nie to say dont say it all. And if someone doesnt like the food they can always cook at home =(^-^)=!",

    "text": "Variety is the spice of life, and is this spice of life that is missing from Nirvana II.  There are plenty of delicious spices in the food, but I went here for lunch and there were two vegetarian choices (paneer chunks or chana) and three meat choices (not three choices of meat, all the meats were chicken, but three choices of sauce for meat).  I don't consider the biryani as a separate choice, because flavor wise you are getting biryani or rice.  The value is similar to other places in the area, your Mexican or American places have a similar amount of food.  I was a bit over stuffed from getting the 3 entree option - I recommend the 2 entree option as being the right amount of food.  I enjoyed the flavors of the food but without being cheaper or having more variety they aren't going to break into the upper stratosphere of stars.  I also thought the raita (yogurt) was a bit bland plus even asking for two containers I hardly got enough.  The naan isn't worth the trouble.  It lacks that light fluffiness and felt like it had been stacked under something heavy and absorbed extra moisture.  They have the cooking skills, but they didn't make four star choices with the menu.  They are another reasonably fast buffet that you can only carry out and they pack the container for you (they are generous enough).  Conclusion: if you are nearby then go here, but don't travel out of your way.  Find your local supplier.  For me that is a place down the street from my home (see my other reviews and you will find it).",

The selling point here is the magnitude of the portions; if you get the combo they will seemingly give you enough food for a family of nine.  Service is always excellent, and you can be in-and-out in under three minutes on most days.  I generally will just point to whatever looks appealing among the eight-or-so dishes that are served daily, and have always been satisfied.

    "text": "About 6 months ago this place started to noticeably, but subtly, evolve.  Gone were the friendly owners, replaced by a new crop of much younger, less interested employees.  I can recall on not once, but at least 2 to 3 occassions going here shortly after 11am for an early lunch and the place was closed.  I've walked in at 11:30 am and they're still setting up?   Prices went up, small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma-inducing, extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane.  In other words, now you're getting too much food (instead of WAYYY too much food) for $9, instead of $8.  Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer.    One correctable, subtle issue that popped up, and still persists today as I pull another one out of my mouth while chewing and writing this review, is exhibited by the fact that they cook with in-tact, full-sized Cardamom pods and cloves.  Now in and of itself, this is not at all an issue, and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor.  The problem exists when the pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you'll occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes.  It's a rookie mistake, that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality.    Unfortunately, after some serious evaluation of this place for several weeks, if not months (yea I still come here pretty much weekly because it's the closest place to my office) I can no longer recommend this place to folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in their appetites.   The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond my comfort zone.  In fact, the line out the door that used to exist for Nirvana II is gone - the people have spoken!!    The other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade.  In another month or so, after they work out the kinks, I would expect Persis to crush this place on every facet of their offering.  DING DING DING - LETTTS GET READDDY TO RUMMMBBBLLLLEEEE!!!!!

The menu is confusing to read, I still don't know what the pricing is but I usually get biriyani (mixed rice dish) with a meat (either goat curry or chicken tikka masala) and a vegetarian side like paneer. This is actually more than enough food that you can split into two meals. Either that or just get the rice and meat dish for around $8.

Located in the bottom of 3 Wells Fargo, there's a line out the door to this carry-out only restaurant most days. I love Indian food, so I've attempted lunch from this location twice. The second time was only after I suitably convinced myself the first meal wasn't as big of a disaster as I remembered. I was wrong.  They don't serve authentic naan, you just get flimsy pita bread wedges. Their version of Chicken Tikka Masala is a gritty, brownish curry mixture that doesn't resemble a quality version of the dish in any way. The chicken may have bones, or it may not, it's really a surprise by the day.  I've tried another dish -  chana masala from here, and it tasted the same. (Fortunately no bones!) Flavors are just muddy.  Both times I've eaten here, I've tossed my lunch out half-eaten before finishing it. I don't understand why this restaurant is popular. How hard can it be to do Indian carryout right?",
