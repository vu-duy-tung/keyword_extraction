Got the Italian (being a devoted Philly Italian Hoagie guy) and it hit all the right notes (the exception being the smaller, square shaped roll- good quality bread but the ingredients overwhelmed the roll) sharp provolone, Italian cold cuts and a pretty good basil aioli. Add on hot peppers and a sweet pepper relish and it's a pretty darn good $7.95 sandwich. Well done!",

I went in looking for recommendations for different sauce and pasta combinations and one employee gave me nothing but sarcasm and attitude when I asked about different sauces available. Then acted as if I was crazy for asking a question as if his personal conversation with another employee was much more important. Such a sad start to a new location",

One thing that made this menu great was that you could mix and match - for example, my husband and I both got ravioli but I had cheese ravioli with pomodoro sauce and he had chicken ravioli with pesto. We both got added veggies. It was all super fresh and the staff was friendly and quick. When we asked what veggies they had they told us bell peppers and onions. After they started making our food, one of the guys came out and said they realized they also had artichoke hearts if we wanted to add those in which I appreciated the offer. Also big bonus in my book - they had reusable glasses for the water and proper silverware. I love it when restaurants don't run around disposables because they are so wasteful so it was refreshing to see this! They have a great little shop too with pasta that looked amazing. We got a back to take home for later. The food was delicious, the service was quick and friendly, and the price was pretty reasonable! We will definitely be back to try other things!",

They're right across the street from Brawley's, but this is the place to be, with a hidden patio area. The people that work here are also some of the nicest folks you'll meet.

I ask for a compromise for them to add veggies to my pasta. I continually get the same remarks and facial expressions. Not good at all. I questioned the cook as to why there is a problem with me requesting veggies on my pasta. His BS response was that he wants people to taste the pasta. I'm like don't they add meatballs or chicken... As you can see that convo went no where.   I really try to support local businesses but this was a fail.  I really hope their attitude about this changes.

    "text": "Okay, so I'm totally violating my rule of not reviewing a place until after I go there multiple times, but come on, how can this place get any better? Driving back from errands one night, The Lady requests that I pick up Pasta Primavera from Portofinos. Fine choice, but I want something a little bit different. Decide that it would be a perfect opportunity to stop right up the road and check out Pasta & Provisions.  First off, it's a pretty full Italian market. They have a dry-goods section, a deli, and fridges/freezers for all wet things. Most of it is imported, which is super cool. I got super lucky, and their daily special was pretty much a pasta primavera (score) for $7, and I ordered the turkey sandwich for myself, $7 again. The first thing I noticed was that the cooks were cooking with skillets right there in front of me, how much fresher food could you make? Everything was done to-order and fresh, and the taste really reflected that.  I overheard a family order a couple of cannolis, which I missed upon first glance of the menu. True to italian style, the cannolis are filled to-order and dipped in either chocolate chips or pistachios. I didn't really have a difficult decision to make, I'll take 2 small ones (for $1.25 each!) Absolutely delicious.  They have a killer patio out back as well where lots of families were hanging out, plus they do have taps, so you can hang out for a while! We'll be hitting up this place a lot more now that we know about the incredible gem it is. Buon appetito!",

We ordered the fettuccine with mushroom flavored noodles, Alfredo sauce, and chicken.  We also ordered the spinach ravioli with pesto add Parmesan.  Wine is reasonably priced and there is self-serve water dispenser, along with Parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, and oregano to take to your table.  I love this extra touch.  Our buzzer went off after about 7 minutes. Each pasta dish was in a bowl and both were so delicious.   They each came with a piece of bread.  Please let my pictures do the talking.... we will definitely be back!!!",

My wife and I split a caprese pizza and the Italian sandwich.  WOW!  We were blown away.  The pizza's thin crust was nice and crispy.  We had ample mozzarella and delicious balsamic vinegar.  There was so much flavor.  We even added pancetta.  The sandwich was amazing too.  Plenty of filling and everything worked very well together.  We left stuffed and very happy.  I even bought tiramisu from the freezer for later.  The total bill for everything, including the desert and tip, was ~$40, but it was worth it.  One person could eat very well here for $15.

They offer a variety of pasta flavors and sauces made in house alongside their selection of pizza and sandwiches--all absolutely delicious. Would heavily recommend the fettuccini Alfredo on roasted garlic pasta!! The pizzas are thin crust with an indulgent portion of fresh mozzarella. The wine selection is both affordable and comprehensive in taste. In addition to all this, P&P offers a gigantic, varied selection of take-home frozen and refrigerated pasta dishes (I'm talking goat cheese, sweet potato ravioli, baked ziti, you name it)! They do allow dogs outside on the patio and the managers were super friendly to us and our baby boy! 5/5 would recommend.",

I'm working my way through the different flavors now - started with the ravioli, then the egg spaghetti with marinara and so on, most recently the black pepper with pomodoro and meatballs -  and all taste so good you sort of just want to eat the pasta by itself. I adore pasta so I can't get away from that menu but my husband speaks highly of the sandwiches too. The patio is fun in the afternoon with a lot of people drinking beer and enjoying time outside with friends, kids, dogs...  Only complaints I have had: sometimes the pasta isn't well drained so there's a half-cup of water at the bottom of the bowl, and having ice available for drinks would be appreciated since not all of us are beer drinkers.   Take home a loaf of bread for later and if you like olives? Theirs are super delicious.",

It's so much faster than making it myself.    I had the pizza and pasta ordered in and sat outside. The outside area was quaint. The cheese pizza was pretty good, but I thought the fettuccini Alfredo was terrible.   My friend was so nice she traded with me. So I was happy with the pizza.",

It's my dudes birthday and his fave food is Italian. Being the good wife that I am I decided to bring Italy to him.   The dudes at the store today were extremely helpful. They told me about the deal where you can get fresh pasta, a container of sauce, a bag of salad, and bread, all for $20! That's what's up! And I dont even have to tip AND I'll have leftovers! That's what's up!   I got the rosemary pasta, pomodoro sauce with meatballs, herb foccacio bread, and decided to get a bottle of red wine.   The food was AWESOME SAUCE! Literally. The sauce was seasoned well and the meatballs were tender. The pasta itself was so fresh and tasty.   I'd definitely go back. Maybe for some hot food next time.",

They even carry Abbracci Cookies!  The food they have on their daily menu is simple, but fresh and delicious. They have pastas (all homemade), pizzas, and sandwiches. The pasta has more flavor than you can imagine and it takes your taste-buds straight to Italy. I recently had the caprese sandwich and the mozzarella was perfect - very fresh!  The staff is also very friendly and the atmosphere is as casual as it gets. Show up in a dress, or in yoga pants.. no one cares.    I've never had a bad experience here and don't think I ever will.",

They toast the bread on the sides making it crisp and warm and the mixture of the meats, cheeses, and sauces are just delicioso. Mama mia.  I also love the outdoor seating area, as well as the beer selection (both cans and 5 on draft) and the kombucha and cold brew on tap. But the best part is how the deli area feels like a New Jersey deli I grew up with, with homemade sauces and soups, as well as meats and pastas and breads you can grab to try your hand at making food as good as P&P's and failing. Excellente. Thank you.",

They have arrived in Madison Park and that is exactly where I live!  I've been to this location three time but failed write a review.  Me, hubs, and the poo-dell (my dog Valentino who is a poodle..hahaha) walked from our house to Pasta & Provisions.  The goal was to order food there and then walk it across the street to Brawley's.  Score.  I ordered a sandwich and a shrimp Kale salad and both were great!! What's really cool is that I ordered a glass of wine to sip on while I waited for my food.  There is an area where they open this garage door and there is a high top area that has bar stools which is awesome.    Now that it's nice weather and their patio area is open, it's so great!  Go and grab a beer or a glass of wine and order food and sit out back, or take the food to go and walk across to Brawley's.  Such a win win for both of them....but not much of a win win for my waistline.  Who cares...hahaha totally worth it!",

Inside, you will find a counter where you can order pastas, salads, sandwiches made to order. In the back is a large selection of wines, frozen pastas made in house, frozen Italian meals (lasagna, soups, etc) made in house, desserts, dips, etc. Essentially everything you would want to throw a party or a nice night in!  Most recently, my husband and I came here Saturday to get some food to go for our date with our couch and Netflix. We settled on the mushroom ravioli with maranara sauce, add meatballs, one of the salads (side note: There salads are Huuuuuge and definitely for sharing), and a thing of Queens Charlotte bacon and pimento cheese with crackers. Excellent foodie night. Everything was delish. I loved the meatballs!  They have a decent size patio in the back if you want to take your food outside to eat (not a ton of seating inside)  Excellent staple to the Park Road area!",

It's a great new addition. It's a deli and small market with fresh pasta, sauces, wine, and items to fill your Italian pantry. Their other location on Providence makes the fresh pasta. If you want a quick sandwich (that is good portion) or a kale salad for lunch, they have that with a side bag of chips and a bottled beverage.   There are two bar tables with maybe 7 or 8 stools facing Park Road so you can watch the cars passing by while munching on a made to order sandwich. It looks like they are making a side outdoor patio. Maybe 10 parking spots; perfect to drop in, grab and go.   If you're in the neighborhood, pick up something for dinner.",

When the weather is nice they open the big garage doors and you can sit at the bar.

They sell their own pizza dough, Italian soups, sauces, and desserts in the refrigerated area.   If it is your first visit with them, they give you 3/4 lb of fresh pasta in the flavor and pasta style of your choice, free of charge. The staff will recommend flavors based on what sauce or dish you plan to make with their pasta.   3/4 lb was plenty to feed 2 people and it was tasty.

None the less, i proceeded on the adventure on checking what this place was about. The outdoor patio was the perfect setting for the sunny relaxing afternoon.   I gave four stars because of this reason, I felt like my questioning of the menu was an irritant to the staff. When I ordered my pesto chicken and mushroom garlic linguine and cheesy garlic bread it would have been helpful to tell me I'm supposed to just pick up my order instead of waiting to hand my pager off. I even had to ask them what I was supposed to do all the while looking like the lost lamb waiting for the attention of an employee.   The food was delicious though! I loved the pesto and the fresh noodles. The cheesy garlic bread was the perfect addition to my noodle dish but was also amazing by itself. I happened to pass someone and saw that they had tiramisu so I picked some of that up too. After letting it thaw at home, I knew that I would definitely be returning to grab some more!   Overall, this place is nice if you are in the mood for pasta. Even though a little intimidating and not the most helpful staff, I will definitely still go back to enjoy the ambiance of the back patio and drink some wine until my tiramisu is soft enough to devour!",

They have a few indoor seats at the bar and a larger patio area outside. We ordered the garlic rosemary linguini with basil pesto and chicken, a pepperoni pizza and cheesy garlic bread. It was all really good. The pasta is fresh and I like how they cook the chicken. The cheesy garlic bread is delish and comes with a marinara dipping sauce. I like that the pizza is a very thin crust.  I love all their takeaway options. We like grabbing their bolognese sauce and some hand cut pasta to take home with us. They have great tiramisu too.",

This place has bottle wine for sale, pasta and frozen ready-to-bake pasta meals that you can take home and put in the oven for dinner. They also have food that you can order and eat there.   We came for lunch and we split an Italian sandwich and kale salad. First the portions are very generous and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food. The sandwich and the salad were about $7-$8 each.   Second, the salad was very unique and the vegetables tasted very fresh. I am not a big fan of kale but between the light and flavorful dressing and the colorful and tasty assortment of vegetables it made this salad so good! The Italian sandwich was also wonderful. The bread was soft and fresh tasting and included aged prosciutto not just salami  and pepperoni like you get at other restaurants with Italian sandwiches.   This place is small and does not really have much seating on the inside but they have a great garden-like patio outside with plenty of seating there. This place reminds me of a restaurant/provisions store I went to in Italy last summer. It is quaint and the staff was very friendly and very helpful when we were trying to decide what to order.   This place is a great lunch spot but I would also come here for a casual, low-key dinner. They also have a fridge with local craft beers. I definitely plan on coming back, this time ordering what they are known for: pasta!",

You pick the type of pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc), the variety of pasta flavor (lemon pepper, spinach, etc), the protein (meatballs, chicken, shrimp) and the sauce (carbonara, pesto basil, Pomodoro) to create your own pasta. I especially love their pesto basil sauce with linguini lemon pepper.",

We ordered ravioli and fettuccine, both were under sauced and dry. They actually sucked moisture out of your mouth.There were only a couple of other customers in the place when we went, so the problem cannot be blamed on a high lunch volume. For a restaurant that specializes in pasta, I found our visit to be very disappointing, and don't see much reason for a return trip.",

(See pics)  Or you can add a side salad with any sandwich or pasta bowl...  The price is very affordable and good portion...it fills you up but doesn't put you to sleep at 2pm in your cubicle...  I totally recommend this place to my peepz!!!",

When we got our pasta dishes, I had to add salt to mine as I found it lacking flavor. The pasta itself was a little hard as well which was a disappointment.  The wine list was good, but everything was just so pricey! Ordered Riesling for $42/bottle and then got charged $58/bottle on the receipt. Brought it up to the server and he seemed annoyed that we noticed.   The kitchen is open so if you sit at the bar stools you can see the chefs cook. Cool concept, but man do they need to turn up the AC. It got HOT in there to the point that I was sweating while eating. How enjoyable.",

We got the pesto sauce with lemon pepper noodles and the pomodoro sauce with garlic rosemary noodles. We also got the french dip sandwich. Everything was incredibly delicious. We got the stuffed cookies for dessert and I also tried the Updog apple pie kambucha which were all great.   You get your food fast and can either way there at the bar or on the heated patio outside it get it to go.   We will definitely be coming back again!",

    "text": "This place is such a gem. I recently moved in nearby and can walk here from my apartment, which is a huge win. They have great sandwiches, fresh pastas, and wine--so really, everything you could ever possibly need. They're also open past dinner time during the week, which is really convenient if I didn't get the chance to buy something to cook.  I've had their caprese sandwich a couple of times and it's great. They toast the bread with the balsamic on it so it makes a little bit of a crust, which is delicious with the heaps of tomato and mozz. I've also had the turkey sandwich, which is also tasty. The bacon jam on it is wonderful and the avocado makes it all very creamy. My husband and I have also grabbed a couple of hot pastas to go. We tried the rosemary linguine with pomodoro & meatballs and a linguine with alfredo sauce. The portions are generous and come with a small roll, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. We were big fans of the meatballs, too. My husband comes from an Italian family and these are pretty great.   One time we grabbed one of their massive tiramisus to go to have at home, and for I think around $8 this thing is huge. It's perfection. And it didn't last in our fridge more than a day. Whoops. They have a great little wine area, too, with tons of great Italian wines and some discount bottles. There's still so many things I haven't tried like the raviolis and pizzas, but I can't wait to come back to try more.",

    "text": "I have to admit that the name Pasta and Provisions doesn't sound very appetizing. I've driven by here many times thinking it was some sort of grocery store that only sold pasta. Well boy am I glad I was wrong. This place has some delicious sandwiches and drinks.   I got the Italian sandwich. I am told it is the must have choice here. My wife got the pork belly sandwich which had a fried egg on it.  They also have a great patio out back that lets you kick your Uggs up and enjoy the outside air. The staff was friendly AF and really showed us the ropes on how to order. They have these delicious chips from New Orleans that I've never tried before as well.  I sat with my wife drinking kombucha in the fall air and thinking about the future. The crisp breeze was just cold enough to make me wish I had worn a jacket but not cold enough to make me go inside. I thought about how good life has been to me in the past year. And I am so thankful. And much like the leaves changing colors on the trees I too am ready to go with the flow of the next phase of my life. Whatever that may be.   We are all connected. Yes, even the two dudes in suits who chose to sit at the big round table we were already sitting at. Like it's totally cool ya'll didn't even ask or anything. That's fine. Like I said we're all in this together.  The food at Pasta and Provisions is so good and the atmosphere is so cozy. This place is like Uggs for your soul.",

Look up the history of this place because it's pretty cool and family-owned still.  We've gotten them a couple of times now and really like the portion sizes for two people.  We usually get 2 different pastas and 2 different sauces and share them between us.  The pancetta & cartelized ravioli is really good with the pesto sauce or the bolognese.  It's fun to hang out across the street at Brawley's for a beer or two before we pick up our food and head home.",
