I just waited 30 minutes for a chicken nugget meal and received the worst customer service. The employee who finally opened the window to have me pay (Mind you, my food was sitting there for a good 15 minutes as I waited) didn't even apologize and was clearly not happy to be there. I explained to her that I too work in the business but was frustrated I had to wait so long and asked if she could at least give me a discount. I was given such poor attitude from her and eventually was met by the manager. The manager, Deborah, insisted I only waited 10 minutes when I could've easily shown her proof it was exactly 30 minutes by the time I was helped. A simple apology would have gone a long way. I was taken aback. If I were the owner of this location, I'd consider cleaning house or go back to square one and teach these employees what decent customer service means. This is not the first time I have waited an obscene amount or received poor customer service at this location and I don't see myself returning.",

    "text": "Key: Notice the dates on the reviews. This place was great but mismanaged into not so great. First thing to understand is that this is a fantastic location. The result is that they don't have to do it right to keep people coming in.  I went inside the restaurant to eat last Saturday at 5:45 pm. Immediately noticed the place was a dump. Trash everywhere. Even a seat cushion was ripped. (When was the last time you viewed a ripped seat cushion in a McDonald's?) I used the restroom - same thing - one hand dryer was busted. Gross.   But I thought, maybe they cater to the drive through and neglect the store? So I went ahead and ordered my food anyways (plus I had a coupon). Both my Big Mac and the 1/4 pounder came with stale buns. How is this possible at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night?  It's all the fault of the management - the sad part is that it used to be fine but now it's not. Also there is a Chick-a-filet a mile up the road that is awesome. Maybe that is where the management goes to eat?",

Every time I have been here the service is slow and the staff is at best confused and very indifferent. This morning the service is even worse. Many people are complaining about the wait, wrong orders, and unprofessional staff. One man even asked for a refund. This McDonald's needs a new franchise owner. Avoid this McDonald's unless you want slow service and a poor experience.",

    "text": "I wanted to review this place just because it tends to me a bit more unique than the typical McPoison's.  The 4 stars are simply for three reasons and three reasons, only.  Firstly, its location.  It's in a great location and is the only McDonald's directly south of I485.  Secondly, the restaurant is always very well maintained and feels clean, and lastly, the playground.  This location has a great kids play area, especially compared to other McDonald's locations; I've never seen one quite like it.  It has a lot of different  activities on the climbing area alone ranging from ropes to spinners to climbing nets.  It and also has a few other activities such as interactive video games where the child stands on a skateboard and manipulates the game --they're actually get to do some fun physical activity after eating their 700+ calorie lunch.  It also has a similar type device but is a racing game.  As well as the video games, it also has a couple of lower areas where very young children can play if they aren't able to climb on the taller activities.  They even have a fully-netted mini trampoline which is also great for kids.  I really like the seating area where the play area is, too.  Unlike most locations, the one's which may have two tables, this has more like 16 tables so more than two families can site and watch their kids pickup virus' which their body isn't immune to yet.  One downside to this location being as it's the one around here is that the drive-through line can get quite lengthy; though it does go quickly.  It kills me to rate a McDonald's 4 stars, but based on the three factors I mentioned above I feel it deserves it.  The food itself going without saying --its crap*  :)  * OK, my disclaimer to that is that their coffee, chocolate Mocha, and milkshakes are actually pretty good --they get half a star for those items...",

First, the good: This is the only McD's I have been to that has electrical outlets in the dining area where I can get a booth and plug in my laptop. This is convenient as I am often stuck in south Charlotte for several hours and need a place to kill time and search job listings, etc. This is why I gave two stars instead of one.  The bad: The cleanliness of the rest rooms (at least the men's room) leaves much to be desired, even for a McDonald's. I get the impression that all of the employees are hoping that someone else will attend to it.  As for the food, well, it's McDonalds, so what can I say. I usually get a drink and, if anything, maybe an apple pie.",

The odor throughout the building had a very distinct sewage resemblance causing me To have waves of nausea throughout dinner.  I do a lot of travel to 3rd world countries and feel I can hold my own, but given the location of this McDonalds and the clientele it is trying to server, I would of expected this more in a country that has much less sanitation requirements.  I would strongly recommend that HQ or regional management get involved or you could consider this place closed in the near future.  This place just convinced me of my \"Last McDonald Supper\".

Other than that this place was a disappointment. Seemed to be understaffed, the staff there looked messy (all in different ratty tshirts) and the place was a mess!! The only reason we were there is because of the playground. Having to leave the house for 2 house for a house showing will force many parents with 3 kids 6 and under to make a deal with the devil. My devil was McDonalds. As a consumer I assume that all McDonalds make tons of cash...especially ones in crowded locations like this one. I can't image this place is doing that well. Avoid this place if possible!!   If you are reading this and either own or manage this location please do the world a favor and find a new line of work. If you want to stay in the fast food business may I recommend driving across the street or down the road to one of the Chic-fil-as. They always seem busy YET appropriately staffed, well dressed in the same uniform, polite, attentive, and eager to please.",

Thought they would get better when they were bought out by individual owner instead of corporate location but no they are worst. Went through drive through tonight for first time in months. Asked for a Mac , tenders meal and a mcchicken. After seeing the order screen notice the  Mac Jr was not on order I asked if it was on order  they said she had it on there. So I continued after waiting for 20 minutes to get to pay window keep in mind had 4 cars in front of me and no one inside store it took 20 minutes to just get to the pay window. I got to pay window they have my food waiting cold of course and hand it to me in the pay window. Of course the Mac Jr they said was on order was not in bag and the fries tasted like they were sitting for the whole 20 minutes I was waiting. Upon going back into store to correct their error they continued to charge me for the Mac Jr they never put on my order AND ANOTHER ORDER OF FRIES so I ended up getting charged for two cold orders of fries. I repeat do not go to this McDonald's ever they have not gotten better and should just shut the location down. I would suggest going to the new one opening on providence and Audrey Kell but guess what same owner owns them both guess McDonald's is never getting my business again. DO NOT GO HERE EVER",

I was second to have the honor of the opportunity to eat my filet bun as it appears the resident mice had first dibs (I tossed the sandwich) 3. The fries were old 4. The fries were scant (a medium sized amount of fries in a large container) 5.  The fries were hard  6.  I spoke to Teresa the manager who DGAF 7.  I spoke to Josh Ranst the GM at 919-607-0168 who gave even less of AF than Teresa. He yelled, was curt, rude, unapologetic (until I pointed out he had not apologized), had MUCH attitude, and told me there was nothing he could do since he wasn't there when the food was made.  8. They deserve ZERO stars.  9.  I don't see good things ahead for Ranst or this location.",

    "text": "I told myself I wouldn't come back to this McDonalds again and for some reason I did today. This his historically one of the worst and slowest locations that I know of. We placed a mobile order and we arrived 10 mins later. When we arrived we went in and literally there are so many people waiting on orders that we had difficulty finding a spot to stand. Someone told me they were waiting 40 mins. After we waited 15 mins I asked for a refund. The manager told another employee she wasn't going to issue any more refunds as she already did 30 today (this is at 12:30pm). Another employee stepped up and issued my refund.  Horrible service. I can't understand why management hasn't been replaced at this busy location.",

    "text": "I usually don't post reviews, but this McDonald's needs to clean house. I have never experienced customer service AND food of this low of quality! I literally waited in line for 30 minutes, while it wasn't even busy. The manager, Debra, really needs to learn how customer service works... and for the owner: fix the sanitation score.  The manager talked smack about the customer in front of me, and had the audacity to try to prove me wrong, saying I didn't even wait that long.   Also, the rude girl that gave me my food, dangled my drink in front of me, saying \"ooooh you're gonna have to pay\" (when the customer in front me got her food for no cost)   If you can't own up to your mistakes, and you can't practice good customer service... good luck in the real world, young lady.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this McDonalds NEGATIVE 5 stars! at 9 pm at night, the second drive through window was closed, and it took me FORTY FIVE MINUTES to get to the window. Multiple people turned around and either left or went inside the store (I presume), but I couldn't, as I was wearing my jammies and bunny slippers. I ordered a big Mac and a french fry, which I specified to please be hot (the last two times nothing inn my order was even warm). I get out of the line and I am driving home, and I realized that, yes, the fries were hot- but they were less than half full! And none spilled into the bag! My one burger patty was tiny on the bun,almost no big mac sauce on the burger and, NO receipt. I have complained to McDonald's before, and they have never offered a coupon or anything for their cold food (or missing burgers, which has happened also before here). Even though it is inconvenient, I'm going up the road to Wendy's from here on out. I have had too many bad experiences with his McDonald's to ever visit them again at Blakeney. 45 minutes in a line for a freaking hamburger- this is fast food? And you can't even give the clients their correct order? You guys need a full management makeover and employees who can at least learn to fill up a fry bag!",

Came here and was told I'd have to buy a mcgriddle separate for the up charge on replacing the bread. Never had that happen before. Now I know don't come here and drive the extra 10 miles to my normal spot. Left hungry and angry",
