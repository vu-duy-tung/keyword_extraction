ARE YOU KIDDING? We paid for $18 worth of food and you can't get us some sauce with no charge? there was no ketchup either! What kind of customer service is that? Plus, dining room was very messy, I looked other customers had to clean their tables before they seat. I saw a woman who got so mad that she just walked out the door without filling her to-go drink. Probably same thing that I was unpleasant about like our experience. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. REHIRE THE MANAGER!!",

However, THIS PARTICULAR Popeyes is a tremendous disappointment. I have visited this location many times and each time I'm confronted with attitude from the workers and there's ALWAYS something missing from my order. I just visited recently and instead of red beans and rice and Cajun rice I was given greasy French fries. This even after I was asked if I wanted fries and I clearly and specifically stated I did not. When I got all the way back home and discovered that they completely screwed up my order, I was treated with indifference by Darwin the manager. He magnanimously offered to give me what I had already paid for if I drove the hour back to them (thirty minutes each way). He was not at all concerned about my inconvenience and never offered any other fix than replacing the food once I drove back.",

    "text": "Hopelessly disappointed in the South Boulevard location.  Just as soon as Popeye's runs an ad for a \"limited time special\" I run over to this location to take part.  Most recently (this has happened three times) I asked for the $4 wicked chicken combo.  Admittedly it's a pretty good deal.  A bunch of chicken strips, fries and a biscuit for $4.  I went there yesterday (4/24/18).  As soon as I walked in, I ordered my $4 wicked chicken (which was plastered all over their HDTV menu boards) and I was told, \"we don't have that.\"  I said, \"but it's all over your menu board and I saw the commercial TODAY.  So how could it possibly be unavailable?  She said, \"it was a limited time promotion,\"  Clearly it was a limited time promotion.  Like it was cancelled within the 30 minutes it took them to broadcast it and then let me arrive so I could buy something else.  GFY Popeyes.  There is a term for this and it's called BAIT and SWITCH and I left with nothing.  And I won't be back.  I am sure you don't care but Chic-Fil-A didn't become the chicken success story it is by treating customers poorly.  Krispy Krunchy Chicken is WAY better anyway.  Make sure you visit those locations off WT Harris Blvd and Monroe Road in Charlotte.  They are much friendlier and don't cancel your special while on your way there.  I won't be back Popeyes.  You lost a customer for life.",

First off, the floor was extremely greasy. Very dangerous. Yes, I realize they are a fried food establishment. Doesn't matter. Someone could seriously injure themselves in there. Either they aren't changing their mop bucket water often enough, they aren't using a strong enough degreaser or they flat out aren't mopping.   The staff were all completely indifferent.  They only thing that seemed to excite them was cutting up with each other. Food was very slow. Request for ketchup was met with a scowl.  The salt and toothpick containers were empty and full of crumbs and long pieces of hair. From my seat I could see a worker  cleaning out her fingernails while standing over food.   Needless to say, I didn't finish much of my food after that.   It's a real shame this location is so poorly managed. Popeyes, when done well, is a good dining experience with a tasty and original (for fast food) menu.",

    "text": "Having never been to a Popeye's before, perhaps a Tuesday at 7:00 pm visit with the hangries wasn't the time for a first shot, but nothing during this visit would cause me to visit again.   If there is a fast food place with a bigger cluster*expletive* ordering/ retrieving area for dine-in, I have yet to visit it.  The ordering area (from any one of 3 ambivalent teens who don't want to be there), pickup area and the solitary Freestyle machine are all within about 15 feet of each other - WHAT A DAMN MESS!   To add to that, I waited and waited and waited, watching people who came in after me get their food, until I finally asked the manager to get my food for me, his overall demeanor left a lot to be desired.  I had been waiting 15 minutes by then for chicken strips, mashed potatoes and a biscuit, so I asked him to throw it in a to-go bag so I could get out of there.  The strips (I got the regular, not spicy) were decent, the mashed potatoes are served with a watery chickeny gravy that I didn't care for but the potatoes were smooth and creamy, and the biscuit was hard/dry and overly salty.    None of the employees seemed especially jazzed about being there.  This is a pretty new business, so I would perk the eff up, lest another restaurant at this end of town be shuttered and then bulldozed.  With a Chick Fil A a couple of hundred yards away (or McDonald's), there is absolutely no reason for me to return to this Popeye's.  If I want a fried chicken experience, I will head to KFC or to DD Pecker's for some of their southern wings - this Popeye's was *GONG* a loser.",

I was really excited to try their dipping sauces, but they weren't offered and I forgot to ask. Oh well, just another reason to go back! I only wish it were closer.  I do wish this location was easier to get into though- that lane that looks like an entrance? Yeah, it's an exit-only lane. And that other lane that looks like you can get in that way? Yeah, no, you can't. I had to go out onto South Boulevard and back in twice before I found the entrance.",

There's a middle display with dried chilies in glass jars and beads draped over them...  It's a little break from the normal chain decor.  Employees were friendly and got my order right away.  I know it's a grind to work in a \"fast food\" establishment, but they seemed to be having fun with it the day I came in.  There was also a bachelorette party coming through (picking up food for the pre-party) so that definitely added to my experience.  Coke machine here...nice to have the oodles of options with your spicy cajun chicken.    Other than that... prime South Blvd location here... easily visible from the road.  Easy in and out (surprising due to the parking lot design they are working with).  Just watch for those drive through folks if you are dining in.",

To the Tune of $30.00 my boyfriend comes home with food that must have been left from closing the night before. We were hungover but NOT desperate! I politely called and explained our plight. The Manager said bring it back with your receipt. We took Everything even the Apple pies (Which were actually fresh) but since I wasted Time,Gas,And delayed my family from eating we didn't want ANY of it at this point. The Manager NEVER looked at the food, NEVER apologized, and Heck she NEVER even looked at me.. So we drove an hour to Monroe NC to eat Quincys and all the items were FRESH and $4.75 cheaper... lol I guess we won. My advise for this Popeyes!!!  Stay Away At The Top Of The Day!! LoL",

When I moved here found out it was only like four in the whole Charlotte area. And I've been too all four, hands down this is the best! Chicken was fresh, fish was fresh , shrimp fresh... fries fresh! And delicious!! They even give you extra Cajun Seasoning!!! (If you haven't tried it AMAZING) \"I put that Shhhh on Everything!!\" Lol literally I save the extra packets for other meals... lol but anyways thank me later! Lol hands down this Popeyes is the best one I've had clean & friendly also! I'm sure Annie from the Popeyes commercial would say \"Honeyyy this is the best Popeyes in town! Make sure you try my back for limited time five dollar big box!\"",

They asked for my name after I ordered which I didn't expect but thought it was a nice touch! When I pulled up to the the window she said my name took my card and thanked me for coming in! I was through in less than 5 minutes!   And the best part of all....everything was HOT. The chicken, fries and biscuit. I really enjoyed every bite!

Poor service, order is NEVER right, wait time is ridiculous  ( might as well fry the chicken myself), try to discuss your grievances with manager.. epic fail.

I would always go back and they'd exchange out the correct pie. I hadn't been to this location in about a year. I went back today since I was out shopping. Ordered meals and a single apple pie(they're my fave). I get ALL THE WAY HOME and notice there's NO PIE in bag!!  I was so annoyed but I really wanted it so drove another 15 minutes back to get it.

Its not the staff so much as the lack of having the type of chicken your looking for as well as condiments. I don't eat friend food that much so when I do want it its either Chick Fil- A or Popeyes . I choose Popeyes for the fact that I can get wings legs thighs you know any part of the chicken where as Chik- Fil -A only really chicken breast. So here's the problem if I'm choosing Popeyes for that reason how mad am I when I go all the way over there and can hardly ever get the pieces of chicken I want or original vs spicy. they never have wings and barely legs. Then I love the biscuit with honey but why they barley ever have honey. I mean are they not ordering enough supply do they not fry enough chicken?

I drove up to the window and gave them my order which was only 2 items (Butterfly Shrimp & Large Sweet Tea). They told me to drive around and wait. I drove around and waited and waited and waited! Finally, I had to get out of my car and go inside! There were only 3 people waiting in line. Only 1 cashier and the lady who took my order went to her car to get something out. Poor service, dirty, and slow! If you do not want this than stay away from this place. I had to select a star just to post but this place doesn't deserve a star. They need to be shut down!",

Update: Tried going again, and they didn't have anything I wanted to order. Boy taking orders was rude, no sense in that. I worked fast food as a high schooler for 3 years and never talked to people the way employees will talk to you here. They all need attitude adjustments or they should get a different job (not that they could do better with their poor attitudes lol).",

    "text": "This is probably the most mismanaged Popeye's I've ever seen from Dallas to Chicago to DC and Charlotte.  They never have enough chicken, especially during the busiest rush hours, so you're going to be waiting.  I don't know what the cashiers here do because the managers end up taking over whenever you order anything more than a 2 piece combo.  Garbage cans are always overflowing.  Soda machine never works so forget about self-serve.  But, it's Popeye's.  So, what can you do?  Especially since Charlotte has very few fried chicken options.  No, I'm not going to eat Prices on the corner or in the parking lot.",

    "text": "This place is a never ending joke, repeating order 3 times to have them still get it wrong wasn't told my total upon ordering but told to drive around for it umm no tell me what I need to pay first smh.. so I pull around and was immediate told to drive around to the other side of the store and wait to get my food and didn't receive utensils to eat, didn't get sauces I ordered 3 times and didn't get a straw for the drink. Then it gets worse I immediately follow the guy inside who gave me my food and then I have to wait 20 more minutes to be acknowledged by any staff member, when I finally am I ask for all the stuff not present in my order and the lady looks at me like it's a joke.... like lady get real you guys are the joke for missing that much stuff out the order oh and if you thought it ends there you'd be sorely mistaken I get outside with all my stuff ready to eat only to be met with the hardest driest chicken I've ever had i literally felt bad for the chicken that died just to be wasted like that smh this place should be literally burned down and start over banning all past employees from reapplying I've had better food in jail to be frank and these employees should be in jail for there utter lack of any real contribution to society",

    "text": "I don't understand the hype of this place. There are two good things about Popeyes. In general, I enjoy their commercials. And for this restaurant in particular the order taker was super friendly and helpful. That saved this from a 1-star review.    I ordered the shrimp and a basket of fries. It came with a biscuit. It took forever to get my meal so service is not very fast here. When I sat down to eat it, it was so unappetizing that I wondered if it was worth tasting. It wasn't.  The shrimp are tiny and the fries were the worst fries I've had at a fast food place. The biscuit was decent but doesn't campare to Bojangles or even Hardees for that matter.  Again, what saved this from the 1-star review was the order taker. She was out cleaning tables and asked if I had tried their wings yet and I said this was my first visit to a Popeye's. A few minutes later she arrived with 2 wings and their cajun rice for me to try. Wow, I wasn't expecting that.  Both the chicken and the rice were spicy and that's the best I can say about them. The rice w/ beans had an odd taste to it that was really unappetizing. The chicken had no chicken flavor, just spice.  So while the staff is great here, the food is spicy and fried with very little other flavor. Was it worth trying? Only in the aspect that I'll never return to Popeye's again.",

    "text": "If you're a fan of spice, you'll like Popeyes. I always get spicy tenders, green beans and sometimes red beans and rice. All are flavorful and spicier than Bojangles. I love the blackened ranch dipping sauce which I also put on my biscuit. They also have a Coke Freestyle machine which gives you lots of drink options.   Service at this location is hit or miss. The last time I went, staff was friendly,  it was clean and service was fast. Another time I visited it was the opposite. Staff was rude, service was slow, the Coke machine hardly had any flavors and tables were messy. So the two star is because I never know what kind of service to expect.  It's a place I only go if I have a once in a while craving for chicken tenders.",
