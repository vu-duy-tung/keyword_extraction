The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 were the portion sizes. For the price I thought a little more could have been provided. Nevertheless I'd eat there again but wouldn't come hungry!",

My bank notified me that this restaraunt charged me 3 times. I first spoke with Ken Lou  (from the restaraunt) who told me to not pay my credit card bill. I then spoke with restaurants manager Mohammed. He told me that his system only showed one transaction instead of three. Told him i was going to dispute the charges. He then became negative and cocky. Told him i was going to take my business elsewhere.....he encouraged it. When we were there, there was one other table. BUSINESS MUST BE GOOD.....if you want to get ripped off go here.....just expect to be charged three times....",

Overall, the food was good (I definitely recommend the Peruvian ceviche), but nothing else really stood out as a show-stopper. Agree w/other comments that portions are small (I actually like that - get to taste more without over-induldging), but the lack of up-beat atmosphere, location and patronage does not inspire me to return.",

Please don't waste your time as there are so many better places to eat in Charlotte and the price was ridiculous.  We started with the duck confit and the halibut ceviche.  Husband said the ceviche was straight lime juice and that the sweet potato chips were over seasoned.  The duck confit was just disappointing.  The texture of canned cat food and the pomegranate sauce was too tart.  Never in my life have I been disappointed in a dry aged steak.  I am not sure how it's possible.  The flavor on the steak was over powering and the steak was not the perfect slab of buttery perfection I had hoped for.  Especially at a $50 price tag.  The truffle pomme frites were cold when they arrived and over seasoned with truffle.  It was all I could taste for the rest of the night.  Total with 20% tip was $190.  No alcohol.  Not worth it.",

She then suggested a wine pairing that I would not have even considered! I'm glad I followed her advice because it accompanied the meal perfectly. I decided to add the carrot and ginger soup as an appetizer. I enjoyed it but wish the portion was a little larger. For desert the pear cake was a little disappointing. It was a little dry and the caramelized pears a bit off tasting. All in all a pleasant dining experience I enjoyed the meal and even got a scallops recipe from Stacy. Thank you for the wonderful evening",

We had wanted to try it for some of the Unique new items on the 3 course menu. It was very quiet and not busy on this Thursday Night, which is kind of strange during Restaurant Week, but we were nicely surprised. We started out with an extra appetizer which was the Truffle Pommes , yes french fries with truffle salt and a house made ailoi which was delicous! We then varied which item  each of us ordered ( party of two ) so we could taste all the different items. We loved the Pasta  Alla Chitarra which was duck egg Carbonara, it was a nice size portion and the flavor was spot on! The Jerusalem Artichoke Parsnip Bisque was heavenly. One of the Unique things we recieved was a Salt tray, it was served with our Entree, which had Four different sea salts and each was a flavor explosion in your mouth! Really loved that! I got the Filet with Crispy Asparagus and My daughter got the Swordfish with Meyer Lemon and olives and salsify We topped off this dinner with their Salted Caramel Budino which was a wonderful rendition of one of my favorite desserts with homemade almond cookies on the side. Very modern, very chic and well worth the cost this is a great restaurant!",

The wife and i split it and gave plenty to the other couple. They serve 4 different rock salts with the steaks which is a nice touch. The gnocchi was the best I've ever had, period.

The food, however, leaves much to be desired.  My friends and I went during restaurant week.  We all ordered something different and not one of us left impressed.  Although the menu itself looks appetizing, the food when it comes out is very bland.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it taste bad, you just can't taste anything at all.  It's like all the seasonings were removed from the kitchen staff.  The portions are also very small so plan to order many items if you're hungry.  There wasn't really one thing on the menu that stood out.  The dessert was probably the worst thing on the menu.  It was far from a treat.  I wouldn't decide to go again on my own.  The only way I would go back is if a friend was having a birthday dinner there that I had to attend... and even then, I would eat before I left the house.

Offers valet parking service too so you don't have to worry about parking, especially knowing the fact that Evoke is in Uptown Charlotte and any parking is a hot commodity.   DECOR and AMBIENCE:  Impressively ultra-modern, spacious, but yet intimate ambience.  Great place for an intimate group and couples, or just for yourself to freely indulge.   LIBATIONS and EDIBATIONS:  Distinctive, premium wine selections and staffed with True mixologists (not just bartenders).  Don't come Evoke and expect to pay non-premium prices - This is rightfully so an ultra-lounge / restaurant, so Expect a Premium Level of modern-stylized food and beverage, which is what you unfailingly get here.  All ingredients are rigorously sourced locally, nationally, and globally while maintaining freshness and quality.  I had the bucatini and gnocchi were excellent - delicious and high-quality (all pastas offered are freshly made by a chef whom is fully dedicated to making all of the offered pasta). Crudos (I had the hamachi & escolar) were very exciting, comprised of fresh, bright, and harmonious flavors all together.  I will come back to try out additional items on the menu, especially the steaks!   SERVICE:  Our server was extremely patient and communicative.  The entire front of the house was very attentive (not overly), polite, and respectable-looking.  I enjoyed the service which made the overall Evoke experience memorable and fun.   I highly recommend this modern Italian steakhouse as your next self-indulgent, fine-dining experience!",

The music was really odd though...can't get away from that. Back to what you really go to a restaurant for...the food. The food was spectacular. Sweet potato ravioli with bourbon butter sauce was unreal. I had the tenderloin medallions which are served with an assortment of various salts. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The desserts were good, nothing outrageous. The presentation on the dishes were really well done.   Overall, a great restaurant with a ton of potential. Look forward to eating here in the future!",

At first you think it is extremely expensive, but to put things in perspective you could literally split the 36 Oz Rib Eye between three people, which Evoke actually suggests!   Anyway, we began with the Crudo, Himachi & Escolar (similar to white Tuna - Butter)  Well Portioned and Well presented and delicious!  Next we enjoyed the pasta's! They were out of the Gnocchi but had a fresh batch being made, so we waited. Well worth the wait! Airy, Light, Pillows! Large Lump Crab and Pancetta made my and my buddies evening... Ravioli, unreal, Bucantini the hostess said she dreams about and she is right, it is amazing!   Review is way too long, so I think everyone gets the point.. This is a Gem!

This is definitely not your daddy's steakhouse. The plates are just as slick as the setting, with splashes of color and vibrant flavors. I am so happy to have this as a new addition to the Charlotte culinary landscape. Overlook the hotel setting as this is on par with any of the other great dining spots in town.",

The restaurant serves consistently delicious food and, save for my occasional vegan fancies, this traveling girl is in love. Favorites: Peruvian ceviche; Jerusalem artichoke bisque with seared scallop; scallop main course with squash risotto; bucatini pasta; Butcher burger (if seated at the bar). Fancy cocktails, a lengthy wine list and (what?) a bartender who is also a magician. Staff is multinational, attentive and knows their ingredients. Prices reflect the fancy fare, but if it's in your budget and you're looking for a special night out, I recommend this spot. I love good food and beautiful presentation and this place has me totally spoiled.",

We had reservations on a Saturday night, but the ENTIRE time we were there, only saw 2 other tables in the entire restaurant (3 people). You'd think we'd have amazing service, right? wrong. The staff couldn't figure out what dish belonged to who, or keep our waters full. While some of the food was awesome (ceviche!), the steaks were terrible all around- tough and poor quality. We ordered a $90 steak, and gave up after it came out wrong twice (first cooked med, then completely raw except for the slightest sear). After receiving our over $100 bill for a meal we didn't have (weren't charged for the steak, but we were for the other food we had ordered- deserts were offered on the house), we noticed water pouring from the ceiling. Not dripping, pouring. We alerted the bartender, who asked us if we were \"pissing\" on the floor\". Not funny. He then mentioned the pool was directly above us and had opened earlier that day. This was pretty alarming, so we immediately jumped up and paid our bill from a safer location within the restaurant.  Even If the pool hasn't collapsed into the restaurant by morning, avoid this place.",

The chicken was very well cooked and tender and the dates added the perfect sweet. The baby carrots were out of this world good. I really enjoyed this healthy dish and would order it again. I'm tempted to go steak if I come back and I'll surely be drinking wine next time as well and I'd love to try the Brussel sprouts!",

Beware of the asparagus topped w/ fried quinoa. We felt in danger of breaking teeth.  The flavored table salt options are a nice idea, until we realized how potentially contaminated the small open dishes  (covered w/ a piece of cardboard) with a small spoon for application are. We started sampling and then imagined the grubby fingers before us doing the same...ew!  On top of all, we had a remarkably annoying server. At one point we thought maybe we were being \"punked\".

    "text": "We checked out EVOKE recently at the Le Meridien hotel and absolutely loved every bite of our exotic salt covered NY Strip Steak. Le Meridien recently sank $20+ million into the former Blake Hotel and although it doesn't look much different on the outside (yet) the interior decor is straight out of a Mad Men episode. Equipped with 1960's era Donald Draper modern glam, floor-to-ceiling windows, posh seating areas, and pops of yellow accents are featured throughout the predominantly earth tone inspired interior.  EVOKE is chasing an Italian-Mediterranean \"New-Age Steakhouse\" approach by offering dry-aged prime cuts of steak, exotic salts, house-made pastas, and... crudos? I'll get to that later.  We started off the night by getting the Sweet Gem Lettuce Salad and the Baby Romaine Salad. The Sweet Gem Lettuce salad was equipped with tender greens, avocado, tomato, blue cheese, quail egg, bacon, and was covered with a champagne vinaigrette. The salad was a great (light) way to start off the night and the champagne vinaigrette paired perfectly with the quail egg.  The Baby Romaine Salad came with radicchio, vincotto, croutons, and shaved parmigiano reggiano. Again... a great salad with a light touch to start off the night but the croutons we're WAY too big and near impossible to eat.  Next up was the Hamachi crudo with avocado, crispy shitake mushroom, and black hawaiian sea salt. For those that don't know what a crudo is... think carpaccio, sushi, steak tartate, etc... I didn't think I was going to like the Hamachi, I was definitely wrong. The Hamachi crudo with its shitake mushrooms that somehow taste like bacon we're one of the highlights of the night :)  After the Hamachi came the sweet potato and ricotta ravioli with bourbon butter. This dish could easily be eaten as a dessert thanks to its incredibly sweet flavor profile.  For the entree's we sampled the 16oz 21 day Dry-Aged NY Strip Steak with a side of Truffle Pomme Frites, Truffle Potato Puree, and Grilled Asparagus. At this point in the night my partner had already eaten above her weight class and I was just getting started. The steak was perfect... in every way... nothing else to say... just plain perfect. Four exotic salts (Hawaiian, Volcano, Spicy, Smokey) accompany the steak in tiny dishes that allow you to pinch and sprinkle just the right amount for each bite.  The Truffle Pomme Frites we're delicious... as should everything thats been fried and topped with Truffle oil and grated parmesan cheese.  The Truffle Potato Puree was extremely delicious but also very heavy. Just make sure to plan on sharing this dish with someone else or plan on bringing some home.  The Grilled Asparagus was... well... grilled asparagus, enough said.  For dessert we wen't the the Pine Nut Tart and the Berry + Ricotta. The Pine Nut Tart was a fancy version of a pecan pie and was paired with a mascarpone ice cream and a cranberry chutney.  The Berry + Ricotta came with Lavender Honey, Mint, and Biscotti Crumbles which was great, but I felt myself wishing I had went with the Chocolate Cake instead.  We've eaten our way across Charlotte, through Charleston, in and out of D.C., etc... and have eaten at plenty of Steak houses. EVOKE stood out to us as a favorite for its perfectly prepared NY Strip Steak, bacon flavored shitake mushrooms, and selection of exotic salts. Whether you're from out of town or living right down the street, EVOKE should be on your short list of restaurants to check out very soon.",

But it just wasn't crowded on a Friday night. Its located in a hotel so most of the clientele are travelers.  I loved that because of the type of location.  Plus,  the attentiveness of the hostesses, bartenders, and servers were amazing. I think at least 5 different people came to us in the first hour.    To start off, the drink was delicious!  We got a recommendation from the bartender who's a certified mixologist, who infuses his own Vodka. Just amazing. Name has escaped me but just ask for a \"sweet, STRONG combo\" and you won't be disappointed.    Now on to the food...sides and apps are definitely enough to share, so we got a little of everything.  We got the Filet, Creamed Spinach, Gnocchi  (Daily Handmade pasta), and Truffle Fries. Between 2 people we had leftovers. Truffle fries should be sold in stores or home delivered because they were that good. And now that I've tasted homemade pasta, there's nothing like it. To top it all off, we got our anniversary dessert comped, a Butterscotch / Caramel melt with Shortbread Cookies.   From walking in the door to leaving,  everything was great. Definitely a great, new local gem. Needs more advertising to the locals to keep it around. I would come back for sure and bring others.",

Crab lump deviled eggs, good idea again, nice ingredients, bad execution. Watery deviled yolk, the egg white texture was too hard and the lump of crab should be a few smaller pieces instead of the big lump. I could make better versions of each of these dishes for 1/4 the price. Maybe ill come back and try menu items with more yelp mentions.",

    "text": "This restaurant is confused about its concept and the food tries way too hard. It's a combo of small plates and full meals. But the full meals come out as they are made just like the small plates. It's fun that way when you're all sharing small plates, but when ordering a full meal people will either have to eat alone or wait until the other food arrives.  We ordered MANY things from the menu and of the 10 or so items we tried I probably only liked 2 and I wasn't wowed by anything.  The little extra things that should elevate the food instead overwhelms everything. A huge majority of the food has a smoke flavor that is overwhelming and kills your palette quickly.  Our waiter was kind but even he was a bit confused about the food. Announcing plates as something they were not. There were a few people at the bar so maybe it's good for that - but otherwise we were hugely disappointed and will not be back. The best part of our evening was the laughs we had about the ridiculous food. It's safe to say Charlotte has much better offerings than Evoke.",

We also had the pork belly, it was like butter that melted in your mouth.We were looking for a truly great steak restaurant and definitely not disappointed.

The place had been remodeled and looked very modern and nice.  Logistically this place could be a little better with the parking for those that do not stay at the hotel. Also the seating along the back - the chandeliers did not line up to the tables. And someone in our group hit their head as we got up to leave.   Parking was also very confusing as the elevator in the garage took us all the way through the conference center and the adjacent hotel. This after paying for parking on the non busy 2nd Ward of Uptown.",

    "text": "So many things can be improved on and some things I don't think they can do anything about.    First off, the food was good.  Although my steak came out a little overdone I still enjoyed the mushroom side as well as the yellow fin tuna appetizer I ordered.  The decor looks good if you don't look too closely.  What I mean is the ceilings look damaged in spots and the space has a general feel of trying really hard but the cracks still come through.  It is a trendy spot but until they figure out how to create a separate entrance it will always have a hotel-restaurant feel to it.    The staff was pretty good, stumbling a bit but nothing critical done wrong.    The real kicker for me was the beer selection.  The selection was fine actually but the pricing was WOW.  $19 for a 12 oz. bottle of a decent Stone beer?  Come on, that's a bit much.  I think the cheapest bottle of an IPA beer was $11.  In general, it is a pretty expensive place to eat and with all the other places to choose from Evoke is going to have an uphill battle finding patrons outside of those that are staying at the hotel.  PS.  $5 to  self park or $10 to valet.",

I had been working all day and my coworker and I wanted a nice meal. We were staying at the Le Meridien so decided not to travel to far.  I had the afternoon on the grass cocktail which was fabulous and then we had a bottle of Malbec between us per he suggestion of the bartender bill. Bill did a fantastic job of keeping us fed and watered.   I started with the ceviche and it was delicious! Followed that with the petite filet with the frites and brocolini. And all of that was absolutely delicious. The frites were AMAZING. and for dessert we split the espresso torte. We asked for an extra scoop of ice cream to try the gelato flavored and Bill hooked us up! Dinner was delicious and I also got it for room service another night while on the trip.   ....but breakfast was a different story. It took 20 minutes just to receive waters and orange juice! And an additional 20 to get our order taken. The food was good - I had the mini waffles. But nothing to write home about. And then we were left waiting for about 20-25 minutes once we asked for the check. And the worst part is there were other tables who got their food before us. Leaving us to believe our server just bit off more than she could chew that AM.   Also every table we sat at wobbled. Not sure what that was about.",

Our waiter was helpful with our drinks and menu items.  The food was great with the exception of the braised greens.  They need to work on that one a little.  We were visited by the general manager of the restaurant and the chef during our visit and given a FREE beautiful dessert for our anniversary and 2 glasses of champaign.  It was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  One word of caution - we have eaten at other \"small plate,\" Tapas restaurants and the food is just that (small portions).  So we ordered accordingly and it was a TON of food.  Just keep that in mind.  Here is what we got.  Small appetizer compliment of the chef - delish! Octopus - could have been an entree and we will go back if for no other reason this.  Best I have ever had. Fingerling potatoes. Corn Bread Braised Greens Fluke 2 of the small filets And then a beautiful smore cheesecake compliments of the house.  Our food came out fast and hot.  We will definitely go back but just order less food.  It was a lot of fun.  Highly recommend.",

Breakfast: For my SPG platinum gift I'll usually take the breakfast option because I've found you can pretty much spend anything within reason. I've had most items on the breakfast menu: pancakes, lox and bagel, eggs and sausage, oatmeal, yogurt etc etc. The pancakes are definitely different -- brioche inspired, and not my favorite, but I could see how someone could them. The lox is hit or miss, which honestly is expected outside of NYC. The eggs are too buttery for my taste, but the sausage is excellent! Finally, the oatmeal is seriously sweetened with this lavender honey (not my thing!) so beware, and the yogurt is just yogurt, but it's always presented nicely!!   The service is very amicable, but it's not super fast -- budget around 30 min to get in and out. In addition, if you didn't have a breakfast coupon, Evoke is pretty $$$ for a simple breakfast so it might not be worth it. Then again, there's not much else in the area, so could be your best bet!",

We started out with a romaine salad, which had pepato  cheese, roasted tomatoes and romaine lettuce. Fresh salad and very flavorful with the roasted tomatoes and goat cheese.  Next we had the gnocchi with lump crab and panchetta... lemon sauce and homemade gnocchi were definitely paired perfectly.  For our main dish we had the 6oz filet mignon and they were buttery goodness cooked to perfection. Joey brought out some finishing salts, and one of them was lava salt... very interesting, but was a take on a coarser sea salt. A must try.  We had a bottle of the Storypoint Cabernet 2014... perfect with the dishes we ordered.   To top everything off they brought my girlfriend a delicious chocolate cake with a candle for her birthday.  Their attention to detail and excellent customer service makes for an amazing night out as well as great food. Definitely worth the money. I will be back next time we are in Charlotte.",

Since our reservation was at the tail end of the great snow of 2016 they called to confirm our reservation- very thoughtful!  The lobby is gorgeous - very relaxing to hang out before or after dinner. Evoke is tucked in the back left corner at a kinda awkward host stand.   Service was divine- we were seated quickly, greeted warmly and educated on the menu. I loved that they offered wine, beer and whiskey flights. Our table tried a cocktail, wine flight and OMB beer flights.  Food was executed well in maybe the most well timed dinner I've ever had out. Why only three stars? Nothing felt innovative, special or surprising. Do all three of those words mean the same thing?  Yes the salmon crudo was lovely, if tiny. Sauces were also quite nice.  Proteins were cooked well, apps were delicious and I was the lone person to love my dessert (brown butter cake with Nutella gelato - amazing!) The gelato and sorbet assortment wasn't served on a chilled plate and melted quickly. And at a several hundred dollar dinner it's those things that make a difference.  In a sea of fine dining options consistent is good, yes but there are so many choices in Charlotte now and I want see something on a menu in a new preparation.  This wasn't a bad meal - just not worthy of a top five restaurant in Charlotte. Come here for a solid meal and great service- plus it's a terrific deal during Restaurant Week. Save your special night out dinner budget for Passion 8, Fig Tree, Customshop, Wooden Vine or Carpe Diem.",

Went on a Friday night and it was slow. The service was attentive. The decor was nice and modern.  Started off with the frisee salad, which was not bad, little too much dressing for my taste. I moved on to the squid ink tagliatelle which was very good, had a nice hint of spice which was surprising. Moved on to the crown jewel: the 21 day aged strip... and it was very good! The server gave us four different kinds of salts for the table and it was fun to play around with the tastes.   I was extremely disspointed with the wine by the glass. I think due to the fact that there isn't a lot of table turnover, I think the bottle was opened for a few days. It's was not a good experience.   I found the sticker shock to the a downer, there are plenty of options at that level in Charlotte that I would go to instead.",

I dined on both the filet mignon and the halibut. The filet came with a variety of salts that added the perfect burst of flavor to the dish. The halibut was fresh and the toppings were a great complement.  For sides, I had tastings of the pommel frites, brussels sprouts, broccolini (all amazing) and the toasted farro which was okay.   For dessert I went for the creme brulee and even though I was stuffed, I still found some room!  A truly delicious meal and our waitress pushed our dining experience up a notch.",

As we glanced over the menu, the combinations of foods and seasonings became more intriguing to us, and with the knowledge and helpfulness of David behind the bar, we made some Great decisions that night.  It's not the typical hotel bar or restaurant, the prices were inline with any other restaurant we would choose, and the flavor combinations are just mind boggling and tantalizing to your taste buds.  Kudos to the Chef!",

    "text": "Okay Evoke. You were never on my list of places to try but when I was invited to eat here I obliged. Walking in you will see a huge open space with super fancy type of furniture. It reminded me a little more high end, but to be honest it was just a refurnished hotel lobby. You get a grand feeling when you walk in and you're greeted. No need for reservations, as you'll see in a second.   So what did I get? I got the Fried Country Steak. I also tried their ribs and truffle grits. The truffle grits honestly was the best out of all 3. The ribs were too sweet and way too small for the price. However they did say that all their servings were small plates. Which meant that the food was small on a big plate. The fried country steak was served in a bowl/plate, so you couldn't cut it because the sides of the soup bowl was irritating. The greens was arranged in a way to justify their high end-ish sort of prices.   The waiter also stated that this place was revamped. It used to be a steakhouse, but as of January they changed it to a small plate tapas restaurant. They're charging a premium for their food here so just be warned. To be honest for what you can get around Charlotte you could get a lot better. But, if you're starving and you want to just go downstairs as you're living in the hotel...you're probably going to end up here.   The service was good, but considering there were only 3 tables other than us on a Saturday night at 7pm it says a lot. The survey after the meal that was given to us was also a big sign on how this restaurant was doing.   Overall, I've definitely had better in everything. I mostly care about food. If you give me the most shit service and your food is banging I couldn't really complain. Plus, if the food is amazing the restaurant would be so busy that the service would suffer anyways. But yeah, this place fell short for me. If you're looking at this place, unless they have changed their menu or done something else... I would look elsewhere.",

Looking at the menu there were a few interesting choices, but I settled on the Country Fried Steak.  Not your traditional style, but tasty none the less.  As some of my colleagues food orders started to arrive, I was a little concerned with how much food would come out.  Evoke has a tapas style combined with a fusion kinda thing going on.  The waitress tried to explain it to us, but we were all busy talking.  So we ordered a few other side dishes to share - the fingerling potato's were a nice fit with my country fired steak.  They have a full bar, but also have Pepsi products - gotta have my Mt. Dew!  We didn't try Desert, but the meals itself was very good!",

The hostess was very pleasant and prompt, and our waiter, Chris, was knowledgeable and very helpful as we looked over the new menu. We decided to do a little sampling of a few items and ultimately chose the country skillet, (it was absolutely fantastic by the way) shrimp Po boys, burrata salad, and filet mignon. For dessert we had the caramel toffee cake. We did not have a dish that was bad, but our favorites were the country skillet, (seriously just get it- you can't go wrong with pork belly and cornbread) and shrimp Po boys. Overall I highly recommend Evoke. In a restaurant market that is becoming more competitive everyday, Evoke holds its own by having phenomenal food, good drinks, and great service.",

    "text": "Unless you're trying out for the debate team and enjoy trivial arguments with strangers over erroneous topics, I would avoid this place.    I wasn't going to write this review, but after trying to shake the experience like waking from a bad dream, I looked up Evoke's existing Yelp reviews and felt compelled to write about the absolute bonkers experience that was last night.    We ordered \"the sea food stack\" described as \"squid ink pasta / blue crab / shrimp / parmesan breadcrumbs\" (see three quarters of the way down in the menu picture). What we received was globs of cheese, a piece of shrimp diced 3 ways and dark blue tortilla chips (again, see picture).   After disassembling the concoction in search of pasta, we starting thinking this was a mistake, a mere mix up with our order in the back or something. So we asked the server if this was correct. He said it was. With our jaws halfway to the floor, I asked why there wasn't any pasta in the dish. Immediately he said \"I'll get the manager\". Thinking I'm in the upside down world, the manager comes out, reinstates that the order is in fact correct, that this blue-corn tortilla chip with globs of indiscernible cheese is the seafood stack squid ink pasta, listed on the menu for $16.   After politefully skirting a few more questions like \"What do you mean this is pasta?\" and \"Don't you think the description is a bit misleading?\", the manager asserted that the cracker-like tortilla imposter was just like a lasagna noodle. That's when I picked up the suspect square and snapped it in half, ineffectively pointing out to the manager that \"pasta isn't supposed to snap in half\". Even with the residual alien cheese soaking through, the substance was clearly still crisp and still vert clearly not pasta. Without even flinching, the manager said \"yes, well it has all the ingredients of pasta, it has flour, squid ink and water\". My date and I incidentally laughed out loud at this assertion and subsequently realized we weren't going to win this one. Not in the upside down world. With that, our mouths returned to their resting upright position and swiftly ended the great pasta debate of 2018 and asked for the check.   The manager offered to bring something else out, recommend the Stroganoff but having debated the definition of pasta with what felt like an unyielding slab of granite, we repeatedly asked for the check fearful of what their definition of Stroganoff would be.   So what prompted me to write this lengthy review? Well, if you scroll down, you'll see a lovely, well-written review by a \"Elicit F.\" (also included, a picture of her review just in case). In her review, she has a picture of the actual squid ink pasta! With actual PASTA! Proof! We were hoodwinked. Bamboozled. Confirmed: upside down world.   After paying the bill we went straight to Desano for pizza. If you're still remotely considering visiting Evoke after reading this review, I would recommend you save yourself the hassle and just head straight to Desano for pizza instead.   The End.",

Our server was friendly and attentive, my sister enjoyed her cocktail, and the place has a cool, modern ambiance.   The food? Mehhh. It wasn't bad, but I expected better. We started with complimentary pork rinds and glazed cornbread. The pork rinds tasted like...well....pork rinds, and the cornbread was just okay. The cornbread had bacon in it but you couldn't taste it.   Then came the appetizers. I had three baked oysters which were actually quite tasty. Unfortunately they were served on the nastiest smelling pile of seaweed I've ever encountered. My sister had cheerwine glazed pork ribs and they were rubbery.  My sister ordered the fluke as her main course, and while the portion was small, it was a good dish. I had the country fried steak which was all batter and very little steak. I didn't finish it.   Dessert came in miniature mason jar type things. Mine was cookies and cream (too rich) and my sister had the lemon tart one. I think at $30 a head, they could give us a full dessert. Plus, the miniature mason jars weren't really functional because the spoon we were given was too big to reach to the bottom.   Not a terrible experience, but not a great one. There's potential here but they're trying too hard to be unique. I don't plan to return.",

In terms of hotel restaurants, it's among the best - excellent steak, fresh seafood and high quality across the board.  The staff is also excellent - friendly, accommodating and come across as genuinely good people (thank you Amy!).    The burrata salad is among my favorites, as was the steak and gingerbread cake.  All very tasty and probably caused me to eat more than I needed to.    Decor is modern, comfortable and quiet - perfect for a nice catch-up with colleagues or a place to work in the evening instead of your room.  You won't feel out of place dining along either.",

    "text": "For first time visitors, Evoke is tucked away inside of the Le Meridien hotel, just behind the lobby. Atmosphere is very modern, not loud at all, but the restaurant is not that large. Therefore you still feel very much inside of a hotel lobby.   Their Peruvian Ceviche is a must try if you like ceviche. Very fresh with the right amount of spice from the habanero peppers, topped with crunchy shavings of sweet potatoes which adds great texture with a hint of sweetness.   The dish I anxiously wanted to try was the Squid Ink pasta since my first exposure to the dish was in Venice, Italy a few months ago. Other than black beans, it's very rare to see black colored food on our plates. So before trying this dish, there's a strong sense of curiosity since we eat with our eyes first! For those who have never tried this dish before, there is no need to worry about the pasta having a \"fishy\" taste. However, the pasta does have a slight brine/salty/sea like flavor, harmonizing beautifully with the small Bay scallops on this dish. My only disappointment with this dish was pasta seemed to have absorbed a lot of the sauce making it very stiff upon serving . This dish is not for everyone but certainly worth a try if you're a foodie or enjoy seafood.  The flavors were very fresh and I would try this dish again next time I visit.",

The courses are baby sized, my newborn eats more than what's provided on the plate.  If you are looking for a very intimate and upscale looking place to go to this place is the place as long as you are not to hungry.  The 3 stars stem from the flavor of the items we tried in conjunction with the ambiance of the bar area and restaurant. Honestly if I was only rating in flavor and ambiance I would have to give this place 4.5 stars.  We had the Peruvian ceviche as an app and it was AMAZING. We moved to our main course and I tried the Crab Gnocchi which was delicious but extremely small. My husband had squid ink pasta with some type of meat I'm not sure if it was seafood or poultry. All in all the food was tasty but the portion size sucked.",

My husband loved his steak (I thought the variety of salts they brought out were great!) and potato puree with truffle oil.  I had the scallop entree, they were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the veggies they were paired with.  One of my favorite elements of the meal was the butter poached asparagus appetizer.  It was delicious and had a beautiful presentation. For breakfast Ayalah was our server and she was equally as great (yay for good attentive service).  I had the Smoked Salmon Tartine and LOVED it!  I'm going to try and recreate it at home.  My husband had the belgian waffles and they were beautiful.   Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the food, the environment and the service.

We were greeted as we walked towards the restaurant and seated promptly, but our server took too long to come to our table and get a drink order. Another staff member brought out bread and water, but never mentioned anything about our server. We had plenty of time to look over the menu, but it would have been better with a drink in hand. However, the food came out at a nice pace and was delicious. I had the sweet potato ravioli to start, and it was fantastic. The swordfish entree was great too, the fish was cooked perfectly. My bf's steak (ribeye medallions) came out before the arrangement of salts, so he initially thought it was bland. The variety of salts really enhanced the flavor of the steak, and he completely changed his mind about the dish. The wine list was nice, and I liked the option of a wine flight so I could try several varietals. Overall, we had a great experience, I guess I was a little impatient at first. Would like to return to try their regular menu.",

    "text": "This is difficult review to write because there was a lot great but also a lot wrong with our dinner here. First of all, the chef here knows his stuff and puts out delicious dishes. We started with cocktails and ordered the Crudos, which they are famous for. We had the Peruvian Cerviche which was delicious and properly prepared. We also had an order of Nairagi (marlin) which was also very nice  and enough to share for two. For our entrees, we ordered two pasta dishes - the Agnolotti and the Spaccatelli. Both were delicious in flavor. The swiss chard+pancetta as a side was also very tasty. Here comes the criticisms. Price point and portion sizes. Appetizers were priced and portioned correctly. Our entrees were not. Though seeming inexpensive, the pasta dishes at $16 and $15 respectively were EXTREMELY small in portion. The Agnolottii was done in 4 forkfuls. Not much better on the Spaccatelli. There was less than 2 oz of food on my plate! I came here to eat. Bread service for two was brought to the table with 3 pieces. 3 pieces for 2 people? Either bring 2 or 4, not 3! Who gets the third piece?! The wine selection was good except for the fact that one one or two offerings of \"by the glass\" for each variety. And the prices were astronomical! They had a glass of Justin Cabernet priced at $20!!!! This is a wine I drink at home often and it costs $25 per bottle retail all day long. This is clearly a rip off. I had to chose the least expensive Cabernet just because of the pricing. All the wines were priced like this. Way too high. Our server was a very sweet young lady who just was not up to the job for a restaurant of this caliber. She spoke in an inaudible whisper and it was plain to see she was inexperienced. For a restaurant of this price point and quality, I expect a server that knows the restaurant in and out and can \"tell and sell\" the menu. The owner needs to invest in better wait staff. The current do not match the rest of the restaurant. It was Friday night at 7 PM and there were 2 other tables being served on arrival. Two more than that when we left. Why so empty? For all the reasons above apparently. Too pricey for too small portions. Killer formula. Sadly, we not be returning.",

After 45 minutes, I asked if the air could be turned down and was told there was a problem with the air conditioner.  No comment from staff, until I asked.  By the time we left, at best, it was the same temperature as outside, mid to upper 80s.  A/C problems happen, but we should have been told when we arrived and given the option to reschedule.  The heat was compounded by how long we had to be in it.  They had 11 total items on their menu.  3 were desserts of the type that would definitely be made ahead of time.  Why did it take 2 and a half hours to serve us when they only had 8 different items to prepare for the whole restaurant?  It was 30 minutes before we got drinks, at least another 15 before the first course, at least 20 minutes AFTER finishing each course before the next was served and 20 minutes after finishing dessert before we got the bill.  There was never any apology about the heat or slow service.",

The portions aren't huge but it forces you to slowly savor every bite. They gave us a number of different salts to try with our steak, something I've never had before but greatly enjoyed. I'm too cheap to go here when pricing is regular but I will definitely go back for another restaurant week. Only 2 issues. First, one of my friends and I who got there early were ignored at the bar for 20 minutes until we finally grabbed a waitress in the serving area of the bar. When the bartender she got hold of finally did come to us, he was super apologetic. We thus chalked it up to them still getting their feet wet and figuring out better how to manage a large crowd. Second, I would not recommend the Citrus Olive Oil Cake. What came out looked like a pre-packaged muffin you could get at any gas station. Other than that though, everything we had was delicious, everyone there was incredibly friendly and we were made to feel very welcome (even if a little delayed in the bar area!).",

Even though most of it was served after it had obviously sat on a counter for a long period of time, you could still tell that each dish was unique and flavorful.  However, because of the service, we'd need a very compelling reason to ever go back given the remaining competition in Charlotte.  For the two of us, appetizers took an hour to arrive at the table (and they weren't busy).  To his credit, the waiter did recognize this and made up with two additional glasses of the wine we were drinking (forgivable error).  Then our main courses both came out at a medium temperature at best.  Similar results with the dessert (half of my wife's sorbet was already melted 50% of the way).  My cocktail order for dessert took over 10 mins to receive, as our waiter took approximately 15 mins to get down the order for the 8-person table next to us.  Eventually, another server brought the drink.  They also managed to hose up the parking validation, so we dropped an extra $5 for a good kick on the way out.  This is going to be a $100 meal for two (more with cocktails or wine).  No way I'd recommend this place to a friend unless I had gone back and seen the service pick way up.  But again, I'm not dropping another $100 or more to find out.",
