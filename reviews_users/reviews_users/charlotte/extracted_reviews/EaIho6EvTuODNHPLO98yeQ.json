    "text": "I was craving some pizza lately, and when a friend mentioned this place for dinner I pretty much immediately agreed. The place is kind of hard to spot, it's tucked away in the middle of the square in the shopping center. But once you get there it's an awesome place to hang out at! We were seated promptly when we entered even though it seemed to be a busy night for them.  My date wasn't especially hungry so he asked to order the spinach artichoke dip appetizer and a bowl of baked potato soup as his entree. This thing was humongous, If all the appetizers are this big I have no idea how many people end up having to take their entrees home, or maybe they're meant to be shared for bigger groups. I opted for their special that night which was a pesto, roasted shallot, sun dried tomato with mozzarella and basil pizza. It was a good sized portion for a personal pizza, however I was kind of disappointed when I found out that even though the pizza was a thin crust it wasn't very crispy.  Our server was very friendly and on top of water refills which I always appreciate. She was also happy to give my date an extra order of spinach artichoke dip and crustini to take home when she noticed that he had finished all of it, talk about A+ service!  Next time I will probably try the various pastas they have, since that seems to get more attention than the pizzas in the reviews I've seen so far, since my meal wasn't super memorable but their service is outstanding!",

    "text": "Many reasons why this has 1 star. Pick up the pizza and it's already cold. Thinking there was enough for 2 or 3 people when I ask for a large, the lack of info of telling me that all pizzas are 10 inches would have been nice to know when you get a piece of pizza that is not geometrically big enough to cut it into 8 pieces, much less it tasted like shit and the \"wood\" fired grill must not have been working, so I guess they used a microwave with a heating lamp. This may be my 2nd review ever, but this place is a damn joke. Gives pizza a bad name. Figure it out business owner",

This \"California pizza wanna be\" is cheaper and the pizza comes out much faster ... but it doesn't rank.   First off the selection is limited, it looks like half of the choices are chicken this and chicken that. Sorry not interested.   Then it gets worse, IMHO the whole point of brick ovens is to get the dough crispy without overcooking the toppings. No joy here either. Both pizzas were undercooked leaving the crust doughy and spongy. The mushroom pizza was so undercooked that cheese shavings never melted. The tomato-basil was better but still undercooked.   To make things worse the waiter didn't seem to like unhappy costumers, he offered to get us the bill while we were still eating and I hadn't even finished my Martini.   Fail",

    "text": "Brixx is okay.  But, I would not say that their pizza is worth the hype people give it.  IMHO, I do not find Brixx to be serving the best wood fired pizza that I have ever had as the crust is too much like a cracker and the toppings usually disappoint in quality. Anyway, on this visit I went with a sandwich.   Atmosphere - Late 80's early 90's feel (mostly w/ the signage), located in an older strip-mall area, nice patio  Food - I had their roast beef sandwich. It was tasty. I liked the focaccia bread Brixx uses and the gorgonzola cheese w/mixed greens and tomatoes was great as opposed to the normal iceberg lettuce other places give you.   Service - It was decent but nothing spectacular. Sitting in the patio area on a nice afternoon added more to the experience than anything else.   Price - $7.95 for the sandwich and chips.   Overall - I have been to three different Brixx locations in my many years in the CLT and I must say...at least they are consistent.",

We had to wait over an hour for a table. When we were seated we were told there was no silverware and we had to go up to the hostess stand for children's menus. We ordered 2 appetizers, hummus and the spinach and artichoke dip (our favorite). Both appetizers were very cold and the dip was 1/2 the portion they usually serve. At this time we still had no silverware. Waitress told us it was a hot commodity. We ordered 3 Brixx salads. The salads were very overdressed there was no goat cheese on the salads and the server did not offer fresh cracked pepper. We also ordered the Rustica pizza and I specifically asked for them to add Goat Cheese. The  pizza had no goat cheese and no prosciutto. The crust was also soggy. Definitely did not taste or look like a brick oven pizza. I sent an email to the management but never received a response. I guess the loss of one customer and her family doesn't mean much to them.",

After three glasses (we were there for quite a bit watching a football game), the waitress brought over the check, without us asking for it and without us telling her if we were done or not. Then on top of all that, the waitress looks at the bottle my mom had been drinking (it was half priced bottle night, so we figured getting a bottle would be cheaper than three drinks), holds it up, inspects the half bottle remaining, and comments \"oh, you did a good job too. Would you all like water- to-go?\" Sad experience because I actually did enjoy the pizza. Not sure why someone working at a bar would be so critical of someone else's three glasses of wine.

I'm just trying to eat, have a beer, talk, and watch the game. I don't want to deal with a bunch of screaming kids running all over the place and fighting over the arcade game in the corner. Even the great beer specials on Mondays are not worth listening to that.   It must be noted that there is only so much the management can do about other peoples' children. Their parents should manage the volume - but I think some just become habituated to it.  Maybe it's not like that every night. But we have noticed it twice.  If you eat here, just ask to be seated in the corner farthest from the arcade game, unless you enjoy the sound of shrieking children after working all day.  Obviously, if you have kids, they're a family-friendly restaurant.",

This is a good deal especially if they have the more expensive craft beers on tap like Stone or Rogue.  Some of the Brixx in town offers half price pizzas and apps after after 10:00 but I am not sure what the half-price status of this one is.  The one on Rea Rd definitely has the half price after 10 deal.    The pizzas are pretty good.  The thing you need to know is you can customize your pizza for no charge.  I like to get the wild mushroom pizza add red sauce, pepperoni, and pineapple; hold the arugula.  I try not to \"over-do\" it because I do not want them to stop not charging for toppings.  The Brixx salad is also a great addition to your meal, a light spring mix with pistachios and goat cheese.  If you decide to get the spinach and artichoke dip, I recommend getting the warm pita triangles instead of the croutons.  They just taste better.",

It was a group of fellas so needless to say the pizzas that we ordered were the ones covered in different meats. But they were really tasty and well-prepared. They also had some good beer options, which perfectly complimented the pizza.   The other few times I've been there I've sat outside. Why mess with a good thing, right?

But the main reason I rated them only 3 stars was because the pizza was only warm served, not hot.",

I'm not sure who the manager on staff was, but what a nice man.....he makes it feel very \"cheers-esque\" in there. Picked up a pizza last night after a little too much fun on a sunday. The people who have cashed me out there have never been anything short of very kind. BONUS: you can buy bottles of wine to go on half price wine night?! SCORE.  My ONLY reason for 4 stars is size of pizza. Sometimes I just want a really huge pizza to myself, ya know?! Kevin McAllister style.",

I will say I am very disappointed though.....we would each either get pimento cheese and pita chips off the appetizers or a pimento cheese pizza. It was great! I'm actually here now and found out that Brixx no longer carries the pimento cheese. We had our hearts set on it, could literally taste it before we arrived, and now we can't get it :( As much as I hate to state this, it might   deturd us from not coming as often. We really hope you get it back!!!!!",

Located off of Fairview, at the back of the shopping center (the first time that I met friends there, I could not find the place), parking is ample at off peak times - during the dinner rush, you may have to parallel park in the lot, or park on the street next to the restaurant.    My most recent visit was for dinner with a couple of friends.  I arrived at the tail-end of the dinner rush (no where to park, annoyed) and my dinner companions had already been seated and ordered beers.  The waiter we had was bleh.  For every refill, I had to flag him down.  They would have sold more beer to the folks that I was eating with if he had been more attentive.  The pizzas are good, better than the delivery chains.  Thinner crust, wood fired pizza.  My typical order is the chicken florentine for $11 (chicken, bacon, roma tomatoes, spinach, feta and mozzarella) and the veggies typically taste fresh with a moderate sprinkling of chicken and bacon.  Their pizzas come in one size - too much for 1, not enough for 2 unless you supplement with a salad or are a light eater.  But, as I always say - any pizza can be a personal pizza if you work hard and believe in yourself.  I like Brixx.  I'll be back.",

She overcharged us for 2 sandwiches and stated that \"included salads\" were an extra charge. Total for 2 sandwiches usually comes out to $20-21 since the sandwich we order is 8.95 plus tax. We disputed this charge but this young lady just kept getting angry saying that salads were extra and not included. As you can see, the menu clearly states that sandwiches are served with salad, fresh fruit or chips.   This young lady (bless her heart) could not calculate what 9+9 was when I had asked her. Obviously I'm going to question her math skills if she can't calculate basic math and read the menu. The total kept coming out to $27 and change even when I had asked her to ring up the order a second time hoping it would be a different outcome. There was no need to call the manager. I just had to walk her through a basic elementary math lesson and a menu reading quiz. I think when she finally came to her senses and the calculation finally registered, she was rude and didn't even apologize. Her demeanor and body language was just hateful. She knew she was wrong.  This is a decent establishment but please when y'all hire people, make sure they know their basic math and is able to read and be aware of what is on the menu.",

The good:  The hummus, their pizzas are decent if you like thin crust and mostly cheese and I like that they will split two different kinds on one personal pizza.  There is one grilled chicken wrap that is pretty good and their side items are decent....I like the fresh fruit bowl and the corn and black bean salad is a good side option as well.  The bad:  Most of their salads leave MUCH to be desired and if you add chicken just go ahead and plan on gnawing on it for a good 5 minutes before it's safe to swallow.  Also, the pesto chicken salad wrap is mostly wrap so that was no good.  The reality:  It is what it is.  It is a semi-affordable lunch spot but I think the Blakeney location is better than Fairview for some reason.  Some things are fresh and done well and other things are just not quite up to par.  I don't seek out going to Brixx but sometimes it is conveniently located and a better option than its neighboring fast food joints.",

    "text": "The first time I've ever been to a Brixx was maybe about 3 years ago? I enjoyed it at the Gastonia location, so I also decided to introduce Brixx to my fiance because he was interested. I did my research like I always do before I eat out... Call me crazy, but I rather be safe than sorry. So I was randomly craving it. Let me start by... I knew of the locations, but I wasn't really sure of the where exactly? We didn't get lost or anything, but finding it was really confusing, so you had to pay close attention!!! To get to the shopping center you have to make a U turn to get into it and the fact that it was super dark it didn't help! So it was kind of like getting a lost in a small ghost town. I was starting to think that the Brixx Pizza place didn't exist, but like I said... the location was really confusing. We finally found the place after 5 minutes, it was all the way in the back at the awkward shopping center to where I was starting think we were going to end up where the dumpsters are usually located. The parking lot was so small and dark, I was scared to get out of the car because it looked \"sketchy.\" So we entered inside the place looking everywhere trying to find the host, and everyone just looked at us like we were crazy? There wasn't anyone to direct us, as we finally found the hosts after looking like deers staring at headlights, we told them we were confused of the directions because apparently the side where we parked was the back! And there was supposedly a special way to enter. They just stared at my fiance and I like we stupid, so it was a awkward start... we were seated at the seats and the waitress was great! So that was the only good thing about our experience. My fiance ordered the garlic breadsticks and said it shouldn't be called \"garlic bread\" because there wasn't any lick of garlic taste in the breadstick and I ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza which I thought I was pretty bland. Honestly when doing research, they had a thing called \"Ernest Hemingway\" which was a non-alcoholic mojito and wasn't even at the location was  a bummer. I might come back, but not this location.",

Food wnd drinks were extremely slow to come out. We waited close to 45 mins for food and drinks took close to 20 mins. Our server was new and did the best he could. I will give it another shot because the food was delicious. I just hope to have a better experience the next time.",

If you have any allergy or special diet concerns, this location goes above and beyond to make sure the needs are met. They run a late night discount special, be sure to ask when you call or dine in. Highly recommended for that moment when you have a craving for guilt-free good food.",

THE TRUTH: This deserves one star, if that. This hurts my heart. I loved it here when I came as a child. Somehow things have changed. My sister's husband never got another beer, though he asked. It took nearly an hour to get one pizza and one salad. It was not busy, however, there were tons of people coming in for takeout. It seems like the dine-in guests were put on the back burner. My sister's buffalo chicken pizza had no buffalo sauce. My mother's salad was the size of a side salad. Our waitress was not friendly and did not refill our drinks and took a very long time to get the check. Sad to see a place I loved so much fall to a subpar restaurant.",

Floor had a bit of trash as well.  Onto the food!   I got the Wood Roasted Chicken Sandwich! I really enjoyed this simple savory dish. It's a safe option and I have to say it was delicious. I gobbled the whole thing up! My waitress was kind enough to give me a little bit of pasta salad which I greatly enjoyed as well as chips (which were slightly stale tbh). I couldn't decide and she kindly offered both so 5 stars for service for that!   We also got the Korean Meatballs as an appetizer. Definitely a savory dish that's a bit much on it's own but the flavor is still really delicious! Think of a tangy bbq flavor. I certainly recommend it on the condition that you get something carby to dip it in.  My weirdo tip? Dip the chips in the meatball sauce. Dip the extra bread from the sandwich in the sauce and eat it with the meatball! Heck, dip the pasta salad penne in the sauce. It's dang good!",

My tip is to get ranch with the pizza it makes it so much better. (Even though it's already good).

This was one of the few places open to dine at.   We were not seated right away. We waited at the front door for a good amount of time. Wasn't too sure where to stand to get noticed. There's no waiter stand at the front but there was one towards the back of the store. This location has two ways to enter so honestly not too sure what entrance should be used. There were quite a few tables open. They definitely had a recent rush because lots of tables were dirty. Finally my husband asked someone if we just pick a seat. He was then asked if we needed a table. They cleaned a table and we got seated.   Our waiter was friendly. Food came out quickly. My husband ordered the soup of the day as well as chicken wings. I ordered their new Korean beef pizza. Our food was pretty good. This is a nice place to come.",

Now it comes with blue corn tortilla chips.  Don't worry, the dip has not changed and is still as good as ever.   My current favorite is the Spicy Shrimp pizza.  The toppings are shrimp on a sriracha base with sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, goat cheese and fresh basil.  YUM.  And it is SPICY!  For $3 more you can have the cauliflower crust which I highly recommend!  Brixx also offers a wheat free crust and vegan cheese and six vegetarian pizza options.",

I love their Americo and Bronx Bomber pies, and there's also a great lineup of salads, subs and pasta on the menu if pizza isn't your thing. There's tons of seating inside, and the spacious front courtyard is a fabulous spot for outdoor dining, with lots of space for the kids to run.   There are better pizza places in Charlotte, to be sure. But for value, atmosphere and service, Brixx' SouthPark location is tough to beat.",

The crust was like thin wet cardboard, the sauce was flavorless and wouldn't make a difference if it wasn't even there, and the cheese was probably government cheese.  The toppings were low quality, pepperoni that added no spicyness, and were definitely not a high quality uncured pep.  It was cut way too thin as well(a good pep should be cut 1/8\" and curl into a bowl when cooked), the mushrooms were soggy.  On the Hawaiian, there was no sauce and had lots of cilantro! Gross!  The rosemary garlic wings had a good texture but lacked any flavor.    I'll never order here again.",

There is tons of parking in the lot for this place but only appears some of the shops are more popular. The bar tender made recommendations on food and I stuck with the basics after he made my makers mojito and attempted to top it with half soda. Ummm it doesn't mention soda in the recipe on the menu. And why is half the drink soda. This is why I like to sit at the bar and watch my drink be made (check my photo). I totally called him out on this soda thing.  So he put it in a smaller glass. So I had the tiniest mojito in the world and you think I trust your recommendations on food?! Nope I'm sticking to the basics to see if you can accomplish a good basic pizza. So had the americo. Very doughy crust. Not okay that I had to ask for water or napkins. Will I return? Maybe if I am desperate. Customer service, food, and drinks need some support. Good luck Brixx and hope your experience is better then mine if you choose to embark on that journey.",

I had eaten at a Brixx for lunch in Gastonia about a month earlier and had a good experience.  The Foxcroft space was nice, but it was a little on the dirty and worn looking side.  The side Caesar salad for $3.25 was terrible and it came the same time as the pizza.  I think a gas station cooler could have served up a better salad.  We ordered 3 pizzas. The BBQ, Veggie, and Meatball.  The BBQ was slightly tasty but the others were bland and flavorless.  The service was equally as bad.  Long stretches where you could not even flag someone to help you.  Another waiter helped for a while during the middle of the meal and we thought our female server (J) had gone home, but she finally reappeared at check time.  We had to wait for drink refills and the check an excessive amount of time.  So close to home we can walk, but we will opt to get in the car and drive somewhere else.",
