Also the banh mi bread was delicious, perfectly crispy, and soft where it needed to be, and the Thai tea was some of the best I've ever had.

They rushed to throw meat in the heater and make my bahn mi and bun bowl in front of me. I addressed how I was lied to and how late the food was. This gentleman offered me a soda...  I don't appreciate dishonesty and not taking responsibility for your errors, especially when it inconveniences a customer. I will not support a dishonest business.  The food also does not taste great. The meat tastes like it has been cooked on a dirty grill, as it has that gritty burnt taste.

I ordered the grilled Ckn sandwich with wings. * about $10* The interior space was neat and efficient....tables and a big screen where the college football was playing. I took a seat on a stool by the window, where a bar style tabletop provided a clear view outside. A couple that came in after me ordered one of the juices that are apparently pretty notorious. It looked good! I'll try on the next visit. It took about 15 minutes to get my order. The veggies were crisp and the grilled ckn was perfectly seasoned and JuST spicy enough. It felt light and clean ! The wings were pretty good too. The sandwich alone could have filled me up. My eyes were bigger than my mouth.  Great experience. Nice price.  Very good food! I'll definitely be going back soon.   Returned on 9/8. Same great level of surface. Consistent food quality. And did I mention the crispy banh mi grilled ckn was less than $5??

They have a variety of banh mi, ranging from the authentic real stuff to all the other weird ones. They eve have a veggie one that, instead of tofu, has some kind of wheat meat sub. That might sound weird, but trust me when I say that Asians make really good faux meat substitutes. If there's not enough animal protein in that for you, you can also add a fried egg.   My favorite is their dessert drinks. They have all the traditional hits like basil seed, lotus seed, pandan jelly, grass, jelly, lychee, and even a delightful cruncy red water chestnut.  I sometimes just get their drinks.   My coworkers are big fans of the coffee drinks with the boba, so someone is always down to order... delivery.  That's right. They deliver to my work.

Some days, its the only reason why we get up and run so we can go there afterwards and immediately stuff our faces.  The bread, filling, fresh pickled veggies, and herb toppings make for a great meal.  The staff here is so nice and they make sure you have a great experience with their food.   You can feel the hard work and love they are sharing with the area and Charlotte and I'm glad to see they are doing very well.  Food speaks for itself here, try everything and anything... you won't be disappointed.  If you are super adventurous:  crispy quail.... hard to eat, but super good.  Any of the rolls are great.  My favorite sandwich is the Grilled Pork, but you can't go wrong with any of the choices.  I've had the Vietnamese Coffee (cold), and it was delicious.  Still need to try the smoothies, but they look amazing.  CBM shares a parking lot with a nearby \"newish\" strip mall, so the parking lot is brand new and easy to park.  I know the \"other guys\" are in the older Sugar Creek area where you may have to dodge some very large pot-holes... I think my car almost got swallowed up by one of them last visit.  I know Charlotte is ready and willing for more ethnic food places... Crispy Banh Mi is definitely one of the trail blazers!",

I've gone with the #4 pork sandwich each time. Bread was fresh, meat was hot and veggies were crisp. I have also had a smoothie (can't remember which one) and a iced coffee. I love how their cups have a sealed top and you get a sharp straw to punch a hole through (ha, it's the little things for me :) ).  There are a few tables for seating and parking is not a problem.   I can't wait to return!",

Either way, Crispy Banh Mi is putting out a high quality product for a very reasonable price.  My original love for the Banh Mi sandwich was planted with Le's, but now I can get the same product with a small fraction of the travel and no WWII style potholes. The space is a clean one and the staff are friendly. I've tried several of the sandwiches, the BBQ pork is my favorite. In the end I don't think you can go wrong. I also had the summer rolls (courtesy of my wife's suggestion) and they were good as well.  In the end you walk out with a full bag of food and your mouth watering uncontrollably for minimal impact on your wallet. Also everyone keeps talking about the teas. I'll have to try one next time. Pro tip - if you are carrying out, order online from their website so you don't have to wait - they take future orders as well.",

    "text": "Welcome to charlotte crispy banh mi, I would like to inform you that I will be visiting three times a week.  So let's start with the specifics.  Located on a side strip on south blvd, your first trip you may miss it but keep looking till you find it!  In a smallish place, don't be intimidated if the line is out of the building, it goes quick and that is pretty good indication of the quality of food they are serving here.  I would recommend the grilled pork banh mi.  It is full of flavorful pork, pickled veggies and the best bread I have had for a banh mi.  The bread is soft, slightly crispy and just the right amount of bread to meat ratio.  This sandwich and its meat to bread ratio are hugely important to the overall product and this place absolutely nails it!  My favorite part is they serve fries!  You can get a taste of Vietnam with a tray of crispy fries next to it!  The Cajun fries were absolutely perfect, crispy, a little spicy and perfectly cooked!  I love this place and I plan on wearing a path between here and my office!!",

It is tucked away off of South Blvd, right across the street from the Panda Express (of which I have never visited, fyi....just a good landmark). There is some seating inside but we usually take it to go.  I was craving a banh mi for lunch and walked on over. My order was the grilled pork banh mi, summer rolls, and a boba thai tea. The banh mi's are huge and all like $4-$5. Honestly, I would be full with just that! The summer rolls are tasty, come with two in an order, and come with this delish sauce! The thai tea is perfection. There are so many different teas, smoothies, drinks that they all make in house.  Absolutely excellent product at an amazing price!",

It has fluorescent lights, it's bright and has basic tables and chairs.  Most importantly, IT'S CLEAN!!!!  Woo Hoo!  Got my food as take out.  I ordered a special Vietnamese vermicelli dish which came with three shrimp on a skewer, a spring roll, pork and a very interesting and fresh salad.  It was great and only $12.  Wanting to try more, I ordered the \"Crispy Favorite\" Banh Mi sandwich which is only $5 and is like a foot long with very fresh vegetables, grilled chicken, and some sliced meats.  Very good and could have been my meal on its own.  Could only eat half after the vermicelli dish.  And finally, I ordered a \"Fruit Delight\" dessert which is part drink and part fruit (coconut, lychee and other stuff.  Drink it with a straw then eat the fruit with a spoon.      Overall I think this was very good and a great price value.  I look forward to returning on future visits to the area.",

I've sent dozens and dozens of people their on my recomendation and they ALL loved it. No ones ever disliked it, or said it was just \"okay\". Everybody jas gone back on their own multiple times. Their sandwiches are great. Vegetarian roll appetizer is awesome. Its vermicelli noodles, lettuce, mint, vegetarian \"meat\" all rolled up in rice paper, served with plum/peanut dipping sauce. So good). Love the cajun fries and the sweet potato fries (ask for the sweet potatoes extra crispy otherwise they can be a little soggy). I'm a vegetarian so I always get the vegetarian banh mi. Its a toasted baguette, with whichever plant based meat product they use (think tofurkey but soooooo much better), a delcious spread, like mayo. Then the sandwhich is stuffed with fresh slices of cucumber, pickled carrots, pickled daikon (radish), jalapenos and sprigs of fresh cilantro (you can 86 any vehgie you don't want when ordering, of course). Also, they delicious frappe's (mocja, hazelnut, caramel, to name a few), smoothies and juices. Try the salted lemon juice. Sounds gross, but its delicious. The food is great. The service is even better. Not expensive at all. Go try it out. You'll thank me later.",

The immediate location does not offer any fancy amenities or shopping, but Crispy can provide a quick, easy, and mainly affordable offering of banh mi's, soups, appetizers and boba/bubble teas and smoothies. The interior isn't meant for service, with only a few tables and a high top bar, so you can grab a delicious and fresh banh mi for $5, well worth the price.  I've had the BBQ pork and the grilled pork ones and prefer the latter just slightly. Much easier than going up to Le's Sandwiches for us, so glad to have them in the neighborhood!",

Not joking, exaggerating, or laying on my common dose of hyperbolic fervor... nope, this place is simply the bees knees, the king of the hill, the big enchilada, etc.  and their Bahn Mi sandwich is simply outstanding!  So run, don't walk, to this restaurant.  Yes I realize it's not much to look at on the outside (or the inside for that matter), but the food is top notch.  While I largely stick with the famous sandwich in the restaurant's name, I've personally tried the egg rolls and summer rolls - both are very tasty.  And while there are a lot of variations to choose from on the Banh Mi front (chicken, beef, pork, veggie, etc.), I recommend adding the fried egg to your amazing Daikon, carrot cucumber and Jalapeno goodness.  The egg puts it over the top!  So what are you waiting for?  Get over there and enjoy!",

The bread was crispy, tender and chewy all at the same time.  And really what drew me to Crispy Bahn Mi was the fact that they had a great assortment of authentic Viet Drinks. I just had to get here for that! And they did not disappoint. You could easily come here for the drinks alone and never get bored. So many choices.   On our second visit, I went with the grilled pork bahn mi {which is normally my favorite} and it was just okay. Not my favorite. I definitely preferred the crispy's favorite.   I would pass on their spring rolls. These were just okay. I mean honestly, nothing exciting about them.   The chicken wings are super crispy and full of great flavor. They did not disappoint.   Come to Crispy Bahn Mi for their sandwiches and walk out with a drink too and you will set. Glad we have this place. Charlotte definitely needed it!",

And, that parking lot looks a scene from Armageddon. Crispy Banh Mi saves the day by opening up shop on South Blvd! In comparison, Crispy is about the same price and also super budget friendly. Unlike Le's, Crispy does take a credit card.  My order: the grilled pork banh mi, egg rolls, and a Thai tea. There are all kinds of different sandwich options here (including vegetarian). If you can't decide, ask for help from the cashier. Personally, I say go with the grilled pork. You can't go wrong with it. As Jeff S pointed out, I like that the egg rolls weren't pack with a bunch of filler type ingredients. There's also an entire menu of coffee, smoothies, green teas, boba, and desserts.   Crispy Banh Mi is tucked away in a strip mall next to Pep Boys and across the street from the Panda Express. There's a handful of tables, so you may have to take it to go depending on how busy it is. If you haven't explored this area of South Blvd, go there immediately. Some of Charlotte's best gems in this 'hood: Burrito Factory, Vietnam Grill, NY Pizza, and Jasmine Grill.",

The place is easy to miss and I passed it on the first try. Hint: it's in a shopping center right across the street from the Panda Express. Turn right into the parking lot directly after the Pep Boy.   I took a quick look on some reviews and decided to try the grilled pork and the peach tea. The service was awesome - everyone was friendly and welcoming (especially the guy at the register). The food was hot, fresh and ooooohhhhhhhhhh sooooooooooo flavorful! Every component of the sandwich from the pork to the pickled vegetables to the bun was pure perfection. I quickly and happily gobbled it up. The tea was also good. I'll be honest, it was really different for me (texture wise). I found myself taking a sip and saying \"hmm...this is interesting\" and then proceeding to take another sip. So while it was a bit different, I (think???) I liked it. No. I did. I mean. I drank the whole thing so I must have liked it, right?  I will be back!",

You can get experimental, but just get the Grilled Pork - you won't regret it.  Your back up plan is the tofu bahn mi - they make their own tofu in house - \"oh, no they didn't\" - oh yes, they did!  All lemonade and fruit teas/drinks are also made in house and have this cute freshness seal which you then get to pierce with a massively wide Bubble Tea straw - pow!  Great location with tons of parking. If they can keep up the speed, service and quality of product, these guys are going to make a killing!  This may just inspire Le's to up their game and open a second more convenient retail location!!",

I went with Crispy's Favorite which I believe had pork, ham, and tofu (possibly, could have been turkey actually). I paired it with another order of Cajun French Fries and a strawberry green tea milk tea with boba. That right there could easily be anyone's lunch or dinner in one sitting.  They can also do rice plates which basically has all the same ingredient as the sandwiches. There's also an extensive drink menu for all their milk teas, smoothies, and slushees in which you can add jelly, boba, etc. at no additional cost.  The interior decor is nothing too fancy and gears more towards a casual experience. At least there's a TV with ESPN on it! Major plus. There's also an open kitchen so you can see all the kitchen staff working on everyone's orders but there's no reason really watch as they're so busy. Great place to stop by for a quick bite!",

Order the grilled pork sandwich and a soda! Sandwich is $4.25! I couldn't remember when was the last time my lunch was that cheap beside eating at MickeyD.  Sandwich was grilled. Pickled veggie was good. Cucumber and cilantro was fresh. The grilled pork was on the salty side. But overall nicely done. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu..

I've had a few sandwiches here that were very good but I was waiting for the right killer sandwich and today I found it - the grilled pork.   In the past I've had the pork roll and the classic banh mi but today I went with the grilled pork which I've seen before and it looked delicious. And it was. All the flavors married well together and the pork was nice and crispy.   The avocado smoothy is a regular item for me as well and I've had some of their fresh made teas. For an appetizer, I've had their egg rolls. Most places put a lot of filler in their egg rolls. Not here. It's almost all meat.    Top that with a knowledgeable and friendly staff, super fast service and great prices and you have a winner here!   This is becoming one of my favorite lunch spots.",

Not a bad problem to have, but they had way more customers than they were able to handle. It all felt very unorganized. Again, recently opened so I understand.   Coming from a Vietnamese family and having had my fair share of Banh Mi, I didn't feel Crispy Banh Mi was up to par. I tried the classic, grilled pork, pork meatball, shredded pork and grilled chicken. The sandwiches were decent, but did not taste very authentic. All of the ingredients were there, but not so much the right flavor. Nonetheless, it was a decent meal for about $5 per person. I will give Crispy another try once they're established, but for now I will stick to Le's Sandwiches in the broken parking lot.   P.S. Highly recommend the dessert drinks! Combination #1 was delicious!",

Husband and I cannot get enough of their sandwiches and we have zero complaints about it. The BBQ pork banh mi and summer rolls are so good I have a hard time getting anything else.  It's tucked away in a little strip mall but once you find it, you'll remember exactly how to get there and want to return frequently.",

I love that they serve bahn mi and French fries (I didn't get the fries though).   I ordered their Crispy Bahn Mi Favorite which doesn't have a description on the menu, but it has a variety of the cold cuts and the grilled pork with pate and mayo. I also ordered summer rolls and a taro bubble tea.   The bubble tea was pretty awesome. It was a little small, which I kind of liked - usually, I don't ever finish them from other places. I will say, it costs the same (or even more) than places that serve larger ones.  The summer rolls were pretty standard. Not exceptional in any way. I did like that it was not overstuffed with noodles.  The sandwich was a little crispy, but a little chewy too. I was disappointed in the texture of the bread. The ratio of fillings to bread was great, the meats were tasty and the vegetables were nice (personally, a couple more sprigs of cilantro would have been great, but I like a lot of cilantro). Overall a decent sandwich that could have been a great sandwich if the bread had a better texture. I will say that I ordered the food to go, so it could be the bread would have been awesome if I ate it there. I might try that next time.",

The bread is perfectly toasted where the outside is crunchy but the inside still nice and soft. The meat is well seasoned. I think they butter the bread inside to keep the sandwich moist.

The only reason why tried this pace was because Le's closes at 5:30pm vs Crispy Banh mi at 8pm.  I thought it was ok overall, but not worth the price for the size and flavor.",

Small fast-food type vibe eat-in or take-out place, with friendly and efficient staff. The manager or owner told me the place was pretty new and offered a frequent visitor card. Since I don't live in Charlotte, I passed, but we exchanged pleasantries while I waited for my to-go order.  Had the Vietnamese coffee and two different banh mi sandwiches to go. One was the house special crispy banh mi, the other was the roast pork bank mi. Wasn't able to eat them right away so they sat in the car for about an hour. However, they were still delicious, the bread nice and toasted and crunchy, with a delicious filling. The crispy was fairly standard fare with an assortment of textures and tastes. The roast pork was a bit spicier, which was to my liking.   Cool little informal place that gets you in and out the door fast, offers a nice choice of various delicious banh mis (including vegetarian), as well as different drinks and Asian deserts, all for a fair price.   Definitely would be on my \"will visit again\" next time I'm in Charlotte of if a location pops up in Raleigh.",

This is a great spot with friendly service and amazing food.  Do yourself a favor and try it out!  A quick search of Yelp for bahn mi near my job lead me to Crispy Bahn Mi.  I stopped in today for lunch.  There was no line or wait at 11:00 on a Tuesday.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The inside had a good amount of seating and looked bright and clean.  My sandwich was ready quickly.  While I drive to the park in Park to enjoy the sandwich, I look forward to eating at Crispy Bahn Mi next time.  With Bahn Mi in the name you would expect a great sandwich, and that is exactly what you get.  The grilled chicken Bahn mi was exceptional.  The chicken and vegetables where in perfect proportion.  The sandwich was a great size and perfect for my lunch.  Everything was fresh with perfect crisp in the vegetables.  If I had to pick one thing to change, I would have liked a little more cilantro and another jalapeno. The way it was was great this is just a personal preference.  Honestly, at $4.50 this was an incredible lunch.  I look forward to eating here frequently and trying the pork as well as the chicken.  My lunch was perfect and I am glad I stopped in today.  Many more happy lunches to come.",

I got the grilled pork banh mi and milk tea with boba. The banh mi was good, but not great. I guess I am picky because I have had a lot of banh mi's all over the US, and this place the portion is not very big for a banh mi nor is its as authentic as I'd like. It's definitely tasty and the price is good for 4.50. Note that banh mi's should never be expensive, it's been my personal rule that if banh mi's are expensive they are not authentic. You may feel differently about this, but this rule has served me well. Some of the best hole in the wall places or even vietnamese grocery stores serves the best banh mi's. Asian Corner New Century in fact makes their own banh mi's in the grocery store in Charlotte.  The milk tea was good, but too much ice, next time I am going to have to ask it to be made without the ice. friendly cashier and convenient technology using square to checkout. Food came out fast, the place is clean. The only thing is parking can be limited so you may have to park further out and making a left into this store on south blvd if you are coming from the south is difficult.",

Lately I've been in a banh mi for lunch and bun or pho for dinner rotation. So on a Sunday afternoon I came to crispy and I was not disappointed.   I ordered the grilled pork banh mi with extra pork, Cajun fries and passion tea. I decided to take out because as usual I was eating on the run.   The sandwich was absolutely delicious. Super fresh toppings perfectly crusty baguette and moist, flavorful pork. The fries were shoestring cut with the perfect amount of seasoning. The passion tea was soooooooo amazing. It is as perfect as a beverage complement can be. It really made the meal complete for me and functioned  as beverage and dessert.   The service is quick, warm and friendly. Super eager to try their bun when I'm able to dine in.   Great little gem!",

Most places have bread that is just thick and just too much. Crispy Banh MI's bread was baked just right, not too thick or too long and bulky that would fill you up faster. They have an extensive sandwich selections accompany with some light appetizers.   What was really cool was the worker's attire, the girls wore the traditional dress \"ao dai.\" The guy behind the counter was really helpful and helped me choose the teas . I tried the green tea with lychee and mangoes with jelly. Gosh, it was really good. I should have gotten another one for the road. Most of the time I cannot finish my tea, but with this place I drank and ate all of the fruits because it was cut small enough to go thru the big straw.   I will definitely try Cripsy Banh Mi again when I am back in town.",

It's a small establishment with maybe 6 tables and 4 bar seats on the window. It gets packed fast during the lunch hour and many come to pick up and go.  They have a huge menu of sandwiches and smoothies. I don't think fries are a typical staple Vietnamese item, but get an order of regular fries. They perfectly compliment the sandwich. Recently, they expanded their menu to include a pork vermicelli dish (bun). It was good, but really, if you go to a place with Banh Mi in the name, stick with the Banh Mi.  The service is fast. The food is fresh. It's easy on your wallet.",

I've heard nothing, but great things- how could you go wrong with 4.5 stars?   Located off of south Blvd across the street from the Panda Express, I would have never found this place without yelp. It's located in a shopping strip, but you can't see it from the street.   I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed! I ordered the chicken Banh Mi and split the eggs rolls(2) and a mango tango smoothie with my husband. He got the original number 1 Banh Mi.   Our food came our super fast and was fresh. The bread was crispy, yet soft. The marinated veggies were delicious and the cilantro gave it the perfect touch. Very refreshing. I also added Sriracha to give it an extra kick. For under $5, you can't beat it.   The egg rolls were ok, but I wish I would of got the shrimp summer rolls. The table next to us got them and they looked awesome!  The smoothie was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> and the perfect match to cool down my spicy sandwich. They have about 16 different smoothie options so there's one for everyone.   I've heard the Vietnamese coffee and Thai teas are awesome- I'll try one next time.   Overall great place for the value. Not something I would crave all the time, but I'll definitely be back again!",

I also frequent the quail appetizer which is a borderline delicacy. Never dissapointed. Been three weeks in a row. The online ordering is to satisfaction.

    "text": "You've checked in here 11 times! What keeps you coming back?  Yelp has been yelling at me so I thought now is the time to write my Crispy Banh Mi review.  There are many reasons why I love Crispy Banh Mi, first of all, I love their hours, they open at 9a most mornings.  And their Thai Iced tea reminds me of tea carts on the streets of Bangkok, minus the bees.  Their menu is pretty straightforward but it seems like there's always something new to try.  I haven't even ventured to try other teas, because I'm too obsessed with Thai Iced tea.    Service is always pleasant and efficient, prices are excellent.  My only complaint is sometimes it's like a saltlick on the sandwiches, not enough to stop me from eating tho'. And certainly I keep returning!  I even have Billy hooked now! #billywillyoubanhmisomething",

    "text": "It was very exciting to hear from a friend that a new banh mi place opened in charlotte near my work and midtown.  My wife and I love banh mi, and try a lot of places wherever we go from Falls Church, atlanta, Santa ana, portland, denver, and dallas.  We have our share of banh mi. So one day during lunch, I decided to try out Crispy Banh Mi and ordered their Crispy favorite and added $1 for extra meat.  The sandwich was very disappointing.  It was toasted but tasted like stale bread, chewy and hard, instead of crispy like their business name.  Even with the extra meat that I ordered, it appeared to have barely any meat.  The sandwich itself was dry due to very little mayo and pate.  I don't mind paying $5 for a viet sandwich, but it's quality must match the price. This place is in no comparison to Le's sandwiches at Asian corner mall.  They need to open another Le in south charlotte area. Overall, the owner of Crispy Banh Mi had the right idea and ambition, but lack experience and expertise.  The sandwich tasted amateurish.  No offense, but I can definitely make a better sandwich buying a Harris Teeter hoagie and order viet meat supplies from California. First time was disappointing.  I'll try again soon to see any difference.  Let's hope they read these reviews and make adjustments, because their current business venture seems bleak.",

    "text": "OMG.....drop whatever you are doing and head straight to Crispy Banh Mi...RIGHT NOW!!! I finally got a chance to go yesterday and I am kicking myself for taking so long.  Don't get me wrong, I love Lee's Sandwich Shop, but truthfully, this sandwich is hands-down a solid winner!  The Pork Banh Mi knocks it out of the ballpark.  I really didn't expect it to be that different, but the smokey flavor of the meat is over the top...I didn't even need any dressing on it (I usually add siracha/may at Lee's).  I seriously think I will go back today!  Fair warning....it is a pain in the butt to get into the place.  I had to go back out onto South Blvd. three times because I turned into the wrong lot, but once I was there, it was worth it!  Just make sure you turn into the lot right next to the sign...don't turn into Pep Boys because it won't go through and the same holds True next door.  Also, starting this Sunday, 12/4, they will be closed for two weeks for a family event, so do yourself a favor and go before then.  If you do, you will be counting the days until they open back up again!",

Another awesome item would be their chicken wings - finger licking good. My husband who's typically not a fan of fried wings loved it! Customer service is always superb as well! Try some of their refreshing desserts as well - goes well with these hot summer temperatures! My favorite is the rainbow one!",

We got the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi and the vegetarian Bahn Mi and both were awesome. The Vietnamese iced coffee hit the spot and I can't wait to try some of their boba tea the next time we're there (milk tea is my fav). Drinks are a bit pricey but that's a small grievance compared to the overall experience. If Le's location creeps you out too much or you're looking for a fantastic introduction to Bahn Mi sandwiches, the Crispy Bahn Mi is the place to be. Can't wait to come back!",

I found hot peppers in my sandwich though I requested none.  I got Cajun fries when I ordered regular.  The sandwiches are significantly smaller than other places I have been but the sides help to fill ya up. The menu does not explain their sandwiches well so ask lot of questions.   Granted they have only been opened for two months, I hope they can stick around because the Banh mi's were yummy (only reason I gave a 4)...it's still a place I will go to for now.

I said to her one drink was wrong because it looked extremely different. She said \"no we just made that one earlier that's why it looks a little different.\" So now her story has changed. I pointed out the fact it had none of the pearls in it, no ice, and floating jellies. She held it up and said \"no there is pearls in it\". There were zero pearls in it.  She \"remakes it \" and they look the same. Still different from what I usually get, both taste different,  both taste disgusting, and extremely sweet.  Seriously blatant liar trying to pass off her mistake or leftovers. This woman has ZERO INTEGRITY.   But she did me a favor because I will never waste my money here again. Thank you!",

Bread is one of the joys of life and a crispy baguette filled with pickled carrots, fresh cilantro, and meat is a simple joy in life for under $5. Compared to the others I've tried this one was a little less amazing, but those flavors and freshness always deserve 4 stars.   This restaurant offers thinly sliced meat options instead of the larger chunks I'm used to where you can see the marinated flavors on the outside skin. The fresh jalapeno slices were also intense so I had to remove them and just drizzle some sriracha for tolerable heat. Maybe thinner sliced jalapenos would be easier to eat.   The location is easy to get to and service was super fast. They offer lots of drinks: smoothies, teas, juices, coffees, and then appetizers and noodle bowls too. I tried the jackfruit, lychee, coconut milk dessert drink with jellies and it was pretty good! Super sweet but I love trying new fruits and these were good.",

They have several different types of banh mi ranging from dac biet to the sardines. I've personally never had the sardines but I definitely would recommend getting dac biet or this nuong. Those two are really good. If you were taking these to go you should get them toasted but have the veggies on the side so that way it won't be ruined when you have to heat it up again later.   I crave vietnamese desserts all the time (aka che). I got the che thai and it was pretty delicious. I would recommend getting less ice so that way you could get more che out of it.

So far I've tried the #1, #4 and #12...#12 is my favorite as I tend to trend more towards a pescatarian diet. They use tilapia which is fried crispy and well seasoned. When paired with the crispy bun, the spice of jalapenos and coolness of pickled toppings, it is a very unexpected level of delicious.   If you're not a fan of pork, Crispy offers chicken and a vegetarian option.   If that's not enough to convince you, there's a list of refreshing drink options from smoothies, fruit teas and fresh lemonades. Plus, the customer service is always superb at Crispy at either location.  Heads up...both locations are quite small. I would not recommend either for groups but don't let that deter you from trying the best Banh mi in town!",

    "text": "Today I skipped breakfast so I thought I'd skip over to CBM and give their fried egg, \"hangover\" sandwich a whirl.  Something was lost in translation 'cause my order arrived with both a \"hangover' and a Grilled pork/Tht Nng #4.   No harm.  It was still around only $11 for two sandwiches and a soda--pretty cheap IMO.   I will tell you what wasn't lost in translation:  that warm egg oozing onto the crisp veggies, perfectly toasted bun, and unctuous flavors particular to Bahn mi.  And, I wasn't even hungover.  I lathered some hot sauce onto one half,  and drizzled hoisin across the other.  Sweet and then spicy--a perfect pairing.   Since I now have a second sandwich I surprised my wife and delivered it fresh to her office.  Yea, sometimes I'm a nice guy.  Even got a \"you're so sweet,\" and a kiss, too.  Not wanting the commute to Le's on N Tryon for excellent Bahn Mi?  I say, 'Give Crispy Bahn Mi a whirl.\"  Your belly will thank you!",

So how did I end up here? I don't know, y'all. I didn't want a sandwich, but I wanted some really good food and I was not disappointed.  I haven't really heard anyone talk about the noodle bowls here and I don't know why, but lemme tell you about mine because I demolished it before I could take a picture. Oops.  I took the advice of the nice cashier at the counter and went with the pork. So. Glad. I. Did. That. First of all, the aroma was crazy. When I got home, my dog immediately came to see what was happening in my bag. Sorry, pretty girl. I love you, but none for you.   The pork was thinly sliced and deliciously seasoned. Crispy and not overly chewy at all. There were some cucumbers, carrots, diakon, lettuce, cilantro and fish sauce. All of the veggies tasted *very* fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't get the egg roll this time, but I think it would be an amazing complement to the bowl, so I'm definitely in for next time.",

A friend and I shared summer rolls, the grilled pork banh mi, and a special noodle bowl with grilled chicken. The summer rolls and banh mi were spot on! The grilled pork in the sandwich was really tasty -- kind of smokey with a wonderful depth of flavor. We didn't enjoy the noodle bowl as much. It wasn't bad, per say. Just lacking any bold flavors and it was kind of cold, egg roll tasted a little stale.   The cashier was super pleasant and personable. You order at the register and then git a number/sit. Your food is delivered to you by an employee calling out your number. Our summer rolls and banh mi came out really quickly. The noodle bowl took a little longer.   Everything was really cheap! My whole order -- summer rolls, banh mi, and a Diet Coke was $10.   While we enjoyed the majority of our food and our visit overall, I'm not sure they'll beat out Le's (banh mi shop in Asian Corners on North Tryon) the next time I'm in a banh mi mood.",

The summer rolls are mostly lettuce and the dipping sauce that came with them was very sweet and reminded me of maple syrup. It looked like they had lots of cool Thai/Vietnamese tea drinks but I didn't try any. The place is very small with only a few tables. We waited for almost 45 mins for our sandwiches bc people ahead of us were placing orders for 8,9,10 sandwiches which slowed the kitchen down. Overall, worth the wait for the best banh mi sandwiches I have had.",

You're eating good and healthy food.   My Pork summer roll was similar to my sandwich. Just great. Will definitely try another Summer roll next time.  My lychee joint was really good. I liked the fresh fruit. Hard to suck up the straw with the ice in the way but that's minor. My dude and I got there in time for lunch before it became crazy packed. So I would advise for lunch getting there between 11am and 12ish during the week.",

I did not come with jalapenos like it was suppose to so I am glad that I grabbed some sriracha to go. The fried tofu side was awful, greasy, bland and not crisp at all. The tofu was also on my sandwich, because they ran out of whatever they normally put on it, and it had the same taste. But all of the sandwich toppings made it okay.   I gave three stars because I plan on going back and trying the sandwich again how it is suppose to be made. But I will not be eating the tofu again, and would not recommend to anyone.",

For five bucks, you can get a Banh mi, perfectly cooked on a slab of mayoed up crunchy French bread, generous cuts of meat (BBQ pork is a classic), and crunchy cilantro and jalapeno. Well worth it's price and value.   Also a big fan of their Vietnamese coffee. Pro tip, you can ask for it with boba if that's up your alley! Super rich and concentrated coffee that'll jumpstart any day!   Don't forget their desserts! So reminiscent of the asian snacks of my childhood! I love the combo #1, which comes with gratuitous amounts of peanut, taro, jelly, and red beans. Delish and only $5!",

The bread is so much smaller, which means less meat and a smaller sandwich altogether.  A bit of a drag honestly, but I'm sure I'll be back, just because this place is my favorite.",

    "text": "I dare you not to love this little family run Banh Mi joint (once you find it, that is!) You have to be looking closely for its tiny storefront tucked away between two other businesses off South Blvd, but if you ARE lucky enough to find it (or are wise enough to check Yelp), I bet you will find it nearly impossible not to return. Quite frankly, they serve up what I believe to be the best Banh Mi in town at the incredibly low price of $4.95 (yes, $4.95!) In fact, everything on the menu, is a bargain. Also, once inside, you will be surprised to see the dining area is twice the size you'd expect.  The Rice Noodle Bowl with chicken, at $7.95, was loaded with chicken breast and beautifully fresh cilantro, carrots and cucumber. The chicken breast, although a bit dry, was delicious. The rice noodles were perfectly prepared and everything artfully displayed.   Not to be missed is the Deep Fried Tofu and Sea Weed appetizer (at 3 bucks!) It appeared that every table had an order delivered. By the way, they take your order at the counter,  prepare everything to order and then deliver to your table fresh, hot and delicious. The wait is worth it!  The Sunday that my wife and I were there on our first lunch visit, there was a continual line of customers, 90% of whom were Asian (always a good sign regarding authenticity of cuisine.) Plus the small dining area of 10 or so tables were all full. Service was friendly and sanitation score was a 95. Being sticklers for sanitation, we noticed that the food preparers conscientiously changed gloves between the food prep area and the register and did not handle their cell phones in the kitchen.  Although it is a haul from our south Charlotte home,  we will return when in the area. Considering everything, I can find no reason not to award it 5 stars.",

I have to say both were delicious and the shrimp bun was ever bit as good as Saigon Palace just down the road. Bonus is this place is easier to get \"to go food\" and well - it's just delicious!  I did try the mango drink which also was delicious!  So after several visits.... definitely a winner here !  They did get my order wrong once but quickly fixed it on my next visit!

Tired of looking at all of these mouth watering pictures, I decided it was overdue for me to have an actual visit.  I love trying new places and different styles of food. Vietnamese and Thai are becoming some of my favorite foods to eat. I saw a picture of their special noodle bowl and decided that is exactly what I wanted. The picture pretty much sold me at first glance.   For my meat, I went with pork. I am glad I did as it was amazing. I still remember my initial bite being almost mind blowing. I expected it to be good, but geez, I didn't expect this. It came with an egg roll, pork, 3 shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and veggies. Don't forget to use the lime-chili sauce! My wife ordered some summer rolls and she said they were the best she's had.   I will for sure go back very soon to try one of their sandwiches.",

The portions are just right but I wish they would lather more of that butter or mayo sauce that they spread on the bread.   Today, I gave their Special Noodle Bowl a try. I was a little disappointed (which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5). The egg roll was overfried so I couldn't enjoy the egg roll as much. The marinated beef was delicious as it was very flavorful as they are in the banh mi sandwiches. The portion was much smaller than what they advertise at the store. I thought it would be the same portion like the ones they serve at restaurants (especially for that price) and I had a lot of vegetables taken out. Also, the shrimp doesn't even looked grilled and it's supposed to be grilled shrimp.   Overall, I would stick to ordering their banh mi sandwiches and stick to ordering the vermicelli noodle bowls at Vietnamese restaurants.",

In other words, if you were searching for a rejuvenation, you will find it in this small, sparkling, light-soaked sandwich shop.   The classic Banh-mi is a sensory adventure, of vivacious botanical-colored vegetables; just delicately placed atop a thick layer of sliced ham, which drips its salty-sweet juices from the brittle edges of fresh bread. Not to mention, the portions are phenomenal! When you order a Banh-mi, you get two half sandwiches for the total size of a sub; and it costs less than five bucks. Who says you can't upgrade your appetite, without upgrading your budget?    If you are a True Charlottean foodie, you need to go here immediately!!",

Glad I gave it more chances because their service is a lot faster now. They finally worked out a recipe with their baker so the Bread is actually crispy and sandwiches are of decent size now.  Glad you guys figured it out!",

    "text": "Decided to stop by on a Saturday evening around 6 and it wasn't busy. Very plain inside with no decors as they are fairly new. Ordered 1 summer roll and 2 sandwiches, Grilled pork banh mi and bbq pork banh mi sandwiches, and a Lychee tea.   We ate in and the lady brought us our sandwiches and drink but they totally forgot about our summer roll (which was appetizer). We had to go up and tell them. The guy who rung us up had to ask the employee how many did we buy and brought us 2 ordered of summer rolls. He rung us up, yet he didn't know how many we got? So we gave him the second portion back, didn't want the employee to get in trouble.   The bbq sandwich was ok, there were plenty, plenty of fat. As for the grilled pork sandwich, that was great! It was tasty and you could definitely taste the grill. Nice flavors! I would recommend the grilled pork banh mi. The pepper is spicy, so if you cant handle heat, ask to leave it out.   The fruit lychee tea, I wouldn't called it a tea, maybe a fruit drink, but not tea. It was good but you have to drink it quick or the ice will dilute the flavor. It was small and almost $5 for it. Wouldn't purchase it again though. They also have this card where if you buy 9 drinks from them, your 10th will free, but heck! Of course you better do that, you overpriced your drinks. I'll come back for the sandwiches but not the drinks.",

The pate (spread) didnt have that much flavor but again, it wasnt  bad. i hate to compare other restaurants, but will continue to go to my other  favorite bahn min spot.   ordered milk tea with boba and it was very good!  the cashier / hostess was very sweet and happy to help you.",

Probably the best Banh Mi I have ever had.  They also had summer rolls which was fresh and very nice.  The vermicelli was tasty but not amazing, the noodles were good and the beef on top was nice.  Finally had the Crispy Favorite dessert, which was nice and had a good pamdan flavor, it was a refreshing end to a refreshing lunch.  I think this is a great place for lunch, the seated dining area is small but if you are getting take-out its great because the food comes out fast and is fresh.  Definitely want to come back when I\"m back in Charlotte.",

I ordered the grilled pork banh mi and a Thai tea with boba. First off the Thai tea was made perfectly, the boba was cooked right and they put the right proportion of milk and tea in my cup. It definitely tasted very fresh.  The pork banh mi was also very very good. For $4.50 you can't beat how much you get, so you definitely get your money's worth. It was made in a good amount of time and it was hot when I got it. My first bite was not disappointing. The bread was good and the meat with the vegetables really balanced each other out.   Will definitely be here more often!",

There several options for sandwich fillings but I'm a big fan of \"Crispy's Favorite\" but want to try a few more things because they all look delicious. Their smoothies (called Boba Tea at other places) are also really fantastic and worth it. I really like the Avacado but I'm working my way down that sizeable list. Make sure you ask for the flavor pearls that make these standout, or they don't include them. Always a friendly experience when I go and they have a punch card to reward repeat visits. A little difficult to get back out of the parking lot and near impossible if you want to head North on South Blvd, but it is oh so worth it for each delicious bite of that Banh Mi.",

    "text": "Crispy Banh Mi is a neat little restaurant. You can get in and out pretty quickly. The Grilled Pork sandwich was really good. The bread warm and soft. The pork cooked just right. Tender and seasoned just right. Unfortunately the Vietnamese coffee I had was not authentic Vietnamese coffee. It was overly sweetened like it had a vanilla sweetener in it instead of sweetened condensed milk. The coffee was weaker than normal. I'll try them again tho whenever I want a very good Banh Mi",

The boba is decent though not the best I've ever had. Their appetizers are also really good. Try the french fries and the summer rolls and you won't be disappointed",

The food came out fast and tasted delicious!  I had been wanting to try a banh mi for a while and this was tooooo good! It was so flavorful and fresh. They also had a large selection of teas and other drinks.   Next time I'm in Charlotte I'll be sure to go back!",
