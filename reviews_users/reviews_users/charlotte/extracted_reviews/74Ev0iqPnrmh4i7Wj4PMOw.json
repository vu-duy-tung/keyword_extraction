Pretty expensive meal to make you sick.  We called the next day to let the restaurant know (so they didn't get anyone else sick from the Cobia/lobster rolls (or possibly the salad)).  They could not have cared less nor been more rude on the phone, which was disappointing.  So while the meal and service at the restaurant were quite good the night of, we won't be visiting again.",

Barringtons was a really good meal, but not quite the excellent meal I was excepting.    The food seemed to be hit or miss, depending upon the order (foie gras was outstanding, salad was sub-par). Wait-staff was okay, but not the super-professional crew I was excepting.   Overall, this place was good, but, when excepting the best, it fell a little short.",

Everything we had was well prepared, thoughtfully executed and the right size. In particular I recommend the Gnocchi (amazing) and also the beet/arugula salad (great mix of flavors). The menu is updated frequently but I believe the Gnocchi is always available.   The room is intimate, warm and romantic - a great option for a night out. Location is a bit out of the way, but if you can get to the Ben and Jerry's in South Park, you'll find it. :)",

I have been to Barrington's 3 times and each time was excellent.  You can bring your own wine and pay a corking fee - there is a nice wine shop practically next door.  Or you can order off their wine selection which is good.    It is a quiet place with a relaxed ambiance and is perfect for dates, anniversaries or special occasions.  They focus on very well made food and use local produce where possible.  The menu changes based on selections so there is plenty of variety.  If you are in Charlotte plan a trip to Barrington's - it is one of those rare places that is worth making the trip to often.",

The restaurant Is quite small and there is no place to stand if you are waiting to be seated on a busy night. We stood by the bar and werent greeted for 10 minutes. Also, We had 8:30 reservations and were seated by 9:15. There is one woman who runs the checkins there, however she was also the bartender and a food runner. The whole checkin process was terrible and chaotic.  Food is excellent here though. We started with the mussels in white wine that were garnished with some deliciously fresh tomatoes that you could tell were locally grown.   My girlfriend ordered the chicken which was one of the better chicken dishes I've ever had. It was lightly fried to perfection. I ordered the \"tag\", which is a pasta with prosciutto, mushrooms, and green peas in a rich cream sauce. It was excellent.  Overall, the food deserved merit, but the service was not good. Our server spoke with us maybe three times the whole evening and made me consider breaking my 20 percent rule.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me there for my birthday about a month ago, and I wish I could give 5 stars because honestly most of the food was FABULOUS!!! We had tomato soup which was TO DIE FOR! That was probably the high point of the meal. The foie gras was on a pear tart titan which I had mixed feelings about. The foie was perfection, but the tart titan was too sweet for my taste. Probably just a personal preference because I tend to not like sweet as much as savory flavors.   The main course is where things started to fall apart a little. I ordered the veal gnocchi which had some pretty amazing flavors. The gnocchi was light and fluffy. However, after a few bites I noticed there was a little grit in the sauce. It was the grit you get when you don't wash your spinach properly and you get a few grains of sand in your food. Although as far as I could tell there weren't any ingredients that would explain how a grit got into the sauce. If I am going to pay $30 for gnocchi I would expect someone to have tasted it in the kitchen and realize there was grit in the sauce. Completely unacceptable!  It was such a disappointment for me to have such an amazing meal nearly ruined by a few grains of grit. If I had stopped with the starters, this would be 4.5 stars for me. However, if I had only gotten the gnocchi I would give it a 1 star and never return.",

The food was good but my wife's duck was not prepared as she asked and when we were finally able to get the attention of our server she said that she put the order in for the duck to be medium taking no responsibility for how the duck was prepared and served.  I have had better service at the Waffle House.  In addition the wine was served by over filling the glasses so that she would not have properly attend to our table.     Attention to detail is what makes a good restaurant great.  Barrington's has a ways to go when it comes to service and attention to detail.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you want a great meal and with great  service as we had expected.     In sum, the food would be good if prepared as asked but the service is well bellow what one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber.",

    "text": "I was so excited to eat at Barringtons for my birthday dinner. I'd heard and read so many rave reviews, I was sure it would be amazing. It wasn't. In fact, to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Where to start? We had a reservation for 8 and they even called us to confirm. But when we showed up, they made us wait for 15 minutes and there was nowhere TO wait because the bar was full of other diners in the same position. Waiting for their tables to turn. Pacing wasn't much better after we were seated as we watched our waiter do a series of odd jobs other than wait on tables (never mind ours) for 20 minutes. We only had water and menus. The menu isn't so long that it takes 20 minutes to make a choice. When we finally ordered, the food came quickly, but that was my next disappointment. My shrimp dumplings were only OK, and frankly tasted previously frozen. The halibut main course was a nice but TINY piece if fish, and the sauce flavors were almost too subtle. If I'm going to pay $29 for an entree, I expect more than six or seven bites of food! The highlight of the meal actually was dessert. We had a lemon marscapone cake with blueberry frozen yogurt and candied almonds which was superb! The flavors blended perfectly and the cake was light and moist.   Other than the food lacking that \"fine dining\" perfection I would have expected, the space itself is awful. It's not \"small/intimate\" it's \"small/claustrophobic\" and oppressively loud! The bar was perpetually full to overflowing into the tiny room and the tables are so tiny there's barely room for the plate and beverage. I'm only 5'2\" and 110lbs and I felt like I was sitting at a child's width table at adult height. It felt more like a chain restaurant's ambiance than a place you go for a special occasion that's for sure!   On the whole, a major disappointment. Maybe the economy has them packing people at the bar to up drink sales ( and overbooking to do it), maybe we hit an off-night,  I don't know, but I wouldn't go back. I should have gone back to Ratcliffe on the Green instead. That is a fine-dining experience. Barringtons was not.  ADDENDUM: I just re-read other reviews and wonder if I even ate at the same restaurant (yes, I know it WAS Barringtons, don't worry, I'm being sarcastic)! There was no four course option where we would get selections chosen by the chef, the chef never made an appearance, it was not quiet and intimate, it was loud, stuffy and decidedly \"suburban,\" and the fact that people don't seem to mind dropping $150 for salad and pasta, or appetizer and tiny entree is astounding to me when there are such amazing meals to be had in Charlotte for the same or LESS!",

My parents moved to the area in 2000 from the NYC/NJ area, and we were on the hunt for that \"special\" restaurant for our Christmas eve dinners and other special occasions.  When we found Barrington's, they did not disappoint.  When I am in town from NYC, we always make it a point to go to Barrington's.  It's our family tradition.  The atmosphere is lovely, the food is spot on, and the servers are great - they always seem to remember our preferences.  It's things like that that make this place so special.  My 2 favorite things about Barrington's - First, they do unique things with salads.  I wouldn't say I ever \"look forward\" to salad at a restaurant, but here I do.  The flavors are always inventive and surprising - things I probably wouldn't normally lean towards, but somehow, it works.  Second, The Chocolate Pudding Cake.  A tried and True classic, and I don't think I've ever not ordered it here.  My one complaint:  I could probably easily eat 2 servings...not a terrible problem to have!  If you are a Charlotte resident or just visiting, go to Barrington's.  You will definitely leave satisfied.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Barrington's the only time I've visited. The dining room is TINY to say the least and you obviously must have a reservation. My date and I brought our own bottle of wine, which was decanted and gladly served by our server. My date complained a bit that he thought our server was a tad too stuffy but I personally think he was just being picky.   From what I remember, the food was pretty excellent and the ambiance was very nice and romantic. This would probably not be the place to go wearing your casual duds. I wore a dress while my date wore a jacket and slacks. I had heard people rave about this restaurant but I would like to go back just one more time to get the full effect. Barrington's almost reminded me of Passion8 Bistro down in South Carolina, although, I would prefer to return to Passion8 Bistro because of their awesome food.  I think Barrington's is a great restaurant for a special date night because of it's quiet and quaint atmosphere and attentive service. The experience will definitely leave you feeling pampered... and the money you spend will be relative to that treatment. But totally worth it for that special occasion!",

I got the gnochi and requested to have sausage with it as well. it was absolutely delicious.   Also, one of my coworkers is a vegetarian and he wasn't too happy with the vegetarian items on the menu. After a brief talk with the waitress, she came back letting us know that the chef will put together a special vegetarian dish for him. This level of dedication to the customer was a big big bonus.",

    "text": "This is a NYC restaurant. That is a compliment and a complaint. There is no question the food is outstanding. Arguably the best in all of Charlotte and deserving of national acclaim.   Here is my complaint. Have you ever dined somewhere that it spectacular and the place knows its spectacular? I have experienced this in NYC. Sort of like the honor is all mine and I should be grateful they have allowed me to dine there. Maybe it was just my experience, but there was just an air of pretentiousness.   Second. The place is way too small. This means they have to flip the tables quickly to turn a profit. I was there with a party of four. We ordered a bottle of wine and drinks. The beverages came and we had to order. We were not allowed to order our appetizers while we perused the entree menu drank and chatted. Nope we had to order appetizers and entrees together. The waitress saw the incredulous look on my face and explained that the entrees take a while.   Well the entrees didn't take long. Sorry but after dropping over $250 I don't think I should rushed. I worked in the restaurant industry. I know that people \"park\" themselves at their table. Trust me that was not what we did. This was an assembly line chain restaurant experience. Get'em in and get'em out.   I am glad I went an experienced Chef Moffet's food. He is incredible. He needs some help on the front end. I wouldn't go back. Jim Noble restaurants are much better run and the food is on the same level.",

Our waiter described the menu as, \"it's not so much about choosing what you want, it's about choosing what you don't want to miss out on the most\" and I couldn't agree more. There were 7 of us (get reservations, this place only holds 30ish people) so luckily I was able to get a taste off everyone's plate. Except the venison. Adam knew I wanted a bite and ate the entire damn thing before I could take notice and stab my fork onto his place...and so I put a tack in his chair at work but that's not relevant here. I had the foie gras, pork loin, truffled potatoes and sticky bun w ice cream...sorry, had to stop there for a minute because I became sexually aroused and I'm writing in a public place, all is ok now.",

Enough said on that.  We were told that Chef Bruce (the owner) was cooking this night so our expectations went high.  The Celery Root & Chestnut Soup was an experience in itself.  Loved it.  My Father in-law got the Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Pumpkin Seed Baklava and he loved it.  The presentation was something I had never seen before.  For the main course, our table got the Pan Seared Red Grouper, the Berkshire Pork Chop and the Bacon Wrapped Pan Seared Trout.  All great dishes and made to perfection. My son tore through the trout like it was a hamburger and asked for some of my Grouper.  The deserts were just as good.  I'd go there again as I have been here before.  The only note I can give is if you can find out if Chef Bruce is cooking on the night of your reservation, go.  If not, it could be hit or miss as we have had poorly cooked food here once before when he wasn't behind the stove.",

    "text": "By far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Its not a weekly stop because frankly I need a place to live and a car to drive (and eating here all the time would make me poor) so its reserved for special occasions, or a once every few months becasue I miss it so much and have to go back, type of place.  The menu changes seasonally, except for some standards like the mussels and the roast chicken entree.  I like that it changes except for when I've had something so delicious I want it the next time I go and its gone =(  Favorites have been the monkfish with lobster tempura and bok choy, a mixed greens salad with sweet potato fries, the pea soup, the corn soup, the lemon mascarpone cake (I dream about this), striped bass, flounder, the grouper with \"clam chowder,\" the cosmos, I swear they make them the best I've ever had.  I could go on and on but I honestly can't remember every dish I've ever had what I do know is not once have I left and felt like my meal was medicore.  Service is professional but also not pretentious.  I love when a server jokes around with the table but is not so intrusive that they act like we're all new BFF's.  And that is exactly how they deliver at Barrington's.  Yes its small and yes its pricey but like I said its not a daily/weekly type place to eat out at.  I went in May and June and now that I am talking about it my stomach started growling and I want to go now!!",

    "text": "Ranked Charlotte's best for many years in a row. Located and hidden in the Foxcroft area, this charming restaurant is definitely a special occasion place. Make sure to get a reservation because a late decision and call to see if they have a table will leave you disappointed as there will be none available.   Small and quaint, with a classy interior, you'll feel the ambiance immediately upon entering. We got a table all the way int eh back of the restaurant which was nice. The halibut was awesome as well as the lobster soup. Service was spot on at the beginning of the meal, but was noticeably absent towards the end/dessert. That's the only reason I knock it from a 5 to a 4. The service wasn't bad, just noticeably slow at the end to the point of looking over shoulders to see where she was and if she'd return with dessert, coffee, check, etc.   Overall Barrington's is a great Charlotte find and the choice of many around special occasions. Not overly expensive, but expect ala carte options with an extensive and pricey wine list. This is the same owner (brother is chef) as Good Food on Montford, so for a little something more modern, check it out.",

    "text": "I am a fan of Barrington's...but just barely.  The food here is good and it's probably one of the places in Charlotte you have to eat, but I will return to other places before returning to Barrington's.  After all of the talk about how good the food is at Barrington's, we had admittedly high expectations.  To begin with, we were both fairly disappointed with the bread served prior to our meal.  I generally think that, while not a significant part of the meal, the bread sets the tone for a meal.  Ours tasted and felt like it was either microwaved or warmed in a convection oven.  Of all of the really good meals I have had in my life, I would venture than 95% were proceeded by exceptional bread.    I thought the tomato soup was very, very good. My wife had a mixed green salad that was good but not exceptional.  The entrees were the biggest disappointment. I ordered the lamb chops.  This was, again, a good dish but not exceptional.  I am a fan of keeping food simple.  The hash and greens ended up just being a mix of flavors that didn't necessarily complement the meat.  I also love a good sear to the outside of the meat to provide texture, which this preparation lacked.    My wife had the rigatoni.  This a very rich and abundant dish. I can see what it is popular but think that better pastas can be had at a number of restaurants in Charlotte.    Overall, we had a good experience. It definitely suffered from our high expectations, but I would not rank this as Charlotte's best restaurant largely due to my feeling that it wasn't very innovative, the lamb could have been prepared a little better and the rigatoni was just a decadent but not necessarily tasty dish.",

I made reservations a few weeks in advance just because my schedule is annoyingly tight right now.  Turns out I was lucky as I have heard it can be hard to get if you wait until the last minute.  The service was essentially perfect, they were attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive. The pricing wasn't excessive in my opinion and was in line with what I would expect to pay for a very nice dinner out.  If I was going to compare it another restaurant in town it would be Bon Terra, but the intimate setting makes for a different experience here.  I won't go on and on about the food and will just say that we both loved it.  Everything we ordered was better than we expected it to be.  I had the foie gras, the osso bucco, and the re-imagined coconut cream pie.  I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone looking for a nice place to take a date.  I will definitely be back soon.",

    "text": "This restaurant is representative of many things which drew my wife and I together while we were dating.  Being that we both possess wine palates on the higher end of intermediate and that we both possess a love for fine dinning and edgier epicurean concepts, we naturally thought the world of Barrington's.  It's exactly what you would expect from Chef Bruce Moffett.  A bit more intimate that one would think but this only adds to the exclusivity of the establishment and thereby maintains the integrity of the dishes.  This also means that you should make reservations (although walk-in's are completely possible, I wouldn't stake my dinner on it).  There is a limited menu which varies based on the availability of the ingredients in a given period.  There's also some credence given to ingredients being \"locally grown\" (which is a huge trend in Charlotte).  My wife and I both opted for a 4-course experience and, as usual, we were sure to deliberately differentiate our selection. This way we could sample most of the menu for its conceptual originality (or tradionality) as well as its overall quality and plating.  Everything was tremendous! by far the best fine-dinning cuisine in CharTown.  The wine list was a nice compliment to the meal (not too many of the usual suspects but nothing too allocated).  There are many other choices to be had in Charlotte, but mostly along the lines of chain-concepts and none have the originality or the individual flare that Moffett brings to the table.",

    "text": "First of all, let me say that everything was really good on our first visit to Barrington's. All of the accolades fit and are justified but I really can't give them 5 stars. Our friends had been there on a few occasions and he had set up the reservations for the 4 of us. I had heard that it was a small restaurant but was still shocked at how compact the dining area and bar were.   Overall the service was good and knowledgeable with the menu, even if we got off to a slow start with drinks and ordering. We certainly did not feel rushed. I started with a potato leek soup, which was packed with a lot of flavor and delicious. The wife had a salad and it was alright, nothing spectacular she said. We both chose the Arctic char, which had a nice presentation but again nothing spectacular to the point that I would order something else next time. Others at the table chose the mussels and fois gras as appetizers. The mussels also had great flavor and I would highly recommend. The fois gras, for me, was not enjoyable on this occasion but then again while I like it, it's not something that I would order regularly. The other mains chosen were the duck and a pasta if I remember correctly but can't remember which one. I recall the pasta being good and the duck being very good having just tasted a little bit of each.  What really blew me and the whole party away was the desserts. We ordered 3 with the berry rhubarb cobbler being by far my favorite. They really nailed it on the desserts, which usually I don't even order but glad that I did on this occasion. We even had a little excitement when the table next to us set some paper from a birthday card on fire and we were thinking that we would have to evacuate. The flames were quickly put out and we resumed eating as the smoke cleared.  Barrington's is definitely a good restaurant for a special occasion and I would return to try other dishes.",

    "text": "Went here on a Thursday night at the last minute. We don't get to go out much so wanted to try someplace special. We were blown away by Barrington's and can't wait to go again.   For our first course, I had the mediterranean salad and my wife had the poached pear on argula. Both were simply incredible for many reasons. First, for the creativity and composition of the ingredients such as falafel, hummus, tzaziki, etc. Second, for the quality, freshness and taste, Third, for the presentation and display.   Our entrees raised the bar even higher. I had the grilled swordfish which came on a bed of capellini. My wife had the pork tenderloin on a sweet potato mash with asparagus. The flavors of both dishes had subtle spices as the hint of chipotle in the pork bbq sauce.  For dessert, we split a granny smith apple cobbler topped by a scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream. It was not too sweet or tart and was the perfect ending to the meal.",

    "text": "The wife and I visited Barrington's for our first anniversary dinner.  I cannot say enough good things about our experience.  While this is not the sort of location you dine at while on a budget, I can say with complete confidence that it is worth every penny.  There are a lot of high end eateries in town that feel that they are expensive simply to be expensive, while the food may be good, the staff may be well trained, with ambiance well appointed, they still sometimes feel like they are trying to recreate something else.  Barrington's is not one of these restaurants.  Our appetizers were excellent.  The beverages were poured and priced appropriately.  Our entrees were astronomical.  Erin had the bacon wrapped trout, a real treat, while I opted for their special - essentially lamb two ways (chop & cheek) - it turned out to be one of the best dishes I have ever ordered at a restaurant.  Service was top notch.  Our server, noticing Erin was pregnant pre-empted any concerns by pointing out that what we ordered was baby friendly.   They are knowledgeable, not pushy, friendly and quick.  Woody was our server, I will request him in the future.  The bottom line - if you are looking for a change of pace, something that will challenge you to try something different, but still comfortable, a place which will exceed expectations, which knows what they are doing and focuses on doing it 110% every time, I highly recommend you dine with the crew at Barrington's.  Call ahead, do not expect seating to be available on the weekends without a reservation, you may be able to sit at the bar but a meal like this deserves a table.  Bon apetite!",

    "text": "Small cute place with excellent food: I liked every item I had which doesn't happen very often. I wouldn't wait for a special ocassion--perfect for a nice date night. Being a comforted by food person, this did the trick when we most needed it. 4.5 stars   Food: 4.5, service: 4, atmosphere: 4.3  Cost to worth it rating: 4 (starters around $10, entrees ~$30, desserts $9)  Return worthiness: yes   Highlights:  - Scallops: 4 large ones seared and cooked perfectly on top of creamy grits. Orange marinated fennel and sauce introduced a citrus flavor that added to the layers of the dish yet didn't overpower it.  - Tomato soup: delightfully fresh, highlighting natural tomato sweetness, topped with chiffonades of basil, and for a southern twist fried mozzarella balls. Amusement point was the presentation: with the 2 balls for eyes and olive oil half arch below, it looked like a smiley face. Hub and I shared and they split it into 2 bowls for us which was great since he had a bit if a cold. Heard from other tables you could get a half bowl as well.  - Roasted garlic: loved the cloves sitting on the table. Tender and mellow enough to spread on warm sliced bread: perfect start to a meal.  - Pumpkin waffle with maple ice cream: festive fall dessert and presentation with berries scattered all around. Chose it for the waffle which was great, but star was that house made maple ice cream: bursting with sweet maple flavor with a creamy texture.  - Wine list: heavy on great napa/sonoma ones so of course we approved ;-)  - Atmosphere: small comfortable dining room. Upscale refined food but no stuffiness came along with it which is my favorite combo. Saloon doors to the restroom amused me.  - Service: wait staff knew their dishes and explained them in detail  Lowlights:  - Not on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a>: my preferred way to make reservations and usually just go to places that have that option. Had to make the hub call to reserve.  Lovely spot with food that didn't disappoint. Reminded me of one of my faves Nick's back home and will be back if get a chance.",

Service is very good and what a great atmosphere. Hard not to have a wonderful evening at Barrington's.  Vital Statistic: You are not going to get this level of culinary experience at a discount in any restaurant. It is gourmet and it has a price associated with it. Small space that fills up quickly so plan far in advance for reservations at a table or you may end up at the small bar. Not a bad place to be either.  Great price/value relationship when comparing the high end white table cloth restaurant category.",

This is definitely one of the better fine dining establishments in CLT, although it's sorta the place where you might run into your grandparents - yeah, it's got that formal \"tie and sweater vest\" kind of vibe, which is great when you're in the mood for that type of occasion, otherwise you might find yourself nodding off between dishes.  The food is definitely the highlight here - top notch all the way... never had a dish that I didn't like.  Don't overlook the pasta either - these are like house specialties and are darn good.  The only reason I dinged this place 1 star is because of their wine list.  When you go to a fine dining place like this, with food as good as advertised, you need a proper wine list to go with it.  Sorry to say that most of the wines were just not a match for the food... half of them could be found in Harris Teeter and it was just an oddball list for this place.  Kind of like a 1985 Camaro set alongside a group of Bentleys... in a place that defines elegant dining in CLT, the wine list is obnoxious.",

We started with the mussels and the charcuterie board. To be honest, I normally, order mussels for the sauce and bread, however, these mussels were so big and so good. I have never had mussels with this much meat with them. My dad ordered the charcuterie board and the pretzel that came with it was delicious, and I do not like pretzels.   For the entree, my mom got the short rib with regular mashed potatoes, it was very tender and buttery. My husband went with the flounder and my dad the scallops, everything was fresh and had great flavors. I had the Rabbit Pot Pie, which was very good, the only comment, is it should have had a little more salt, otherwise, great flavor!   The desserts were also delicious, the chocolate cake was a little rich but the special dessert was perfect.   We will be going back very soon, love the atmosphere, it is small but perfect for an intimate dinner, even if it is with your parents!",

We've celebrated birthdays, engagements, and anniversaries in its intimate dining room featuring a fresh, creative menu. Unfortunately, it might be falling off the top spot in our rotation. Last night was a bit disappointing. It wasn't one particular thing, it was a collection of flaws that made for a sub-par experience. Ambiance: It's a small dining room which can enable an intimate atmosphere but it you're not managing the front door, it becomes congested and loud; not romantic. No one was \"managing\" arriving guests and the staff looked confused about seating on time arrivals. Menu: my wife loved her halibut entree and it was selected from a good number of fish, pasta, and meat options; probably 8 or so choices. But absolutely zero vegetarian entrees or even appetizers. Like others posting here, I had let them know about my diet weeks in advance. The kitchen whipped up a pasta w/ veggies dish that was passable but fell well short of Barrington's reputation and price tag. Can you really have 8 - 10 entree options with NO thoughtful vegetarian options in an upscale $$$ restaurant featuring \"new american\" cuisine? I don't think so...",

    "text": "This restaurant was highly recommended in almost everything we read including best restaurant in NC so of course we had to go check it out.  Reservations only.  Very small and comparable to \"How to Cook a Wolf\" (size wise) in Seattle.  Quaint, cute and romantic.    I was told they have the best gnocchi in the country.  I've tried lots of gnocchi in my time, but not enough to say it's the best.  I will say the sauce was dynamite.  Spectacular.  It's remained on their menu for the 13 years they've been around so obviously they have it right.  The bread -- was delicious, but I noticed the tables next to us all got 2 pieces each and we only got one.  I was the only nonwhite person in the restaurant and I hope that's not the reason why.  Then again we were in the south.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope maybe they were just low at the time.    The foie gras was not the best ever, but the presentation and the flavors were well prepared and tasty.  I had a mahi mahi with mango puree for my main dish and it was right up my alley!  A Caribbean kick with a tangy sweet balance from the mango.  Delicious and fresh.    My friend loved the dessert which was a extra gewy cinnamon roll in a iron cast dish.  I found it to be dry on the outside but I was told it was very most inside and was good.    My cappuccino was burnt.  I was disappointed but didn't complain about it.  I figured they do things differently down there and maybe my expectations probably exceeded most coming from the northwest.  I just graciously smiled and fudged a little to the waiter about it being good.  The restrooms were very clean.",

They are better than \"Ok\" but not as good as \"yay I'm a fan.\"  As others have stated, the ambiance is quaint, quiet, intimate.  I love that.  The service was OK for us.  The waitress seemed a little \"rough\" and just didn't provided the polished professionalism you would expect at a place like this.  She had a couple of recommendations for wine based on the description of what I wanted and I think she provided decent options but neither truly hit the spot.    I ordered the butternut squash soup and one of the salads.  Both were done very well and I liked that I could order a \"half order\" so it wasn't too much and I wasn't too full before my entree.  I went with the swordfish for my main meal.  It was OK.  It had a crispy crust around it but the fish itself was pretty fishy.  The menu said it came with white beans, broccoli rabe and chorizo.  You couldn't really taste or find many pieces of chorizo and for some reason the flavor combinations didn't work THAT well.  I mostly just tasted fishy fish with bitter broccoli.  The truffled mashed potatoes were amazing but they came out lukewarm which was disappointing.    We went against our server's recommendations (as she had suggested a couple other things we didn't agree with earlier in the evening) and decided to try the blueberry sticky bun and the smore's creme brulee.  Both get an A for effort, NO doubt.  They both get an A for creativity as well.  They both get a B in terms of flavor and overall enjoyment.    I just don't feel confident to say this is the best restaurant in Charlotte.  I have had better dining experiences elsewhere.  I am not saying I wouldn't come back but if I got to pick a special occasion place to dine it wouldn't be the first thing on my list.",

For appetizers: The spicy tuna tartare and fried oyster combo was incredible. Right up there with top 10 appetizers of all time. The arugula salad was stellar. Next course: Pasta We had the famed gnocchi. Pillows made to perfection in a veal ragu. Incredible. This dish would hold up against the finest Italian restaurants in the world. Next: Fish We had the trout over risotto. So delicious and light I ate it with the skin. Dessert: Coconut bundt cake with house made banana ice cream. So tasty, and so stuffed. Shared all this with my daughter. A bit too much food with dessert, but had to go for it. As the night winded down, Bruce came out by the bar, where we ate. Spoke with the chef for about half an hour. Not only a GREAT chef, but incredibly humble and a really good person. Smart, well traveled and my daughter and I really enjoyed the conversation. We loved it so much, trying another of Bruce's restaurants tonight.",

It's a very small place, quite noisy inside.  Most tables are situated along a wall with a long shared bench.  It's not the best for intimate dining.  The tables for 2 are very small.  The service was fine, again nothing spectacular.  I did notice that the table next to us brought their own bottle of wine.  All in all, an ok experience but not worth $200 for 2 people.",

    "text": "I'll keep THIS review much shorter than the Doctoral Dissertation that I left the first time. First and foremost, Barrington's is still the BEST Restaurant in Charlotte (IMHO)! The quality of the food, the presentation, the atmosphere, the service, the EXPERIENCE is really second to none. You certainly can make a great case for Zebra, the Fig Tree, and maybe one or 2 others, but to my taste buds, Barrington's still rules.  Went here on a Tuesday night, which thankfully isn't their busiest, so we had a relatively easy time getting in. Started off with a couple of Rose Wines to whet the appetite. I brought a 95+ Point-rated Chateauneuf-du-Pape as our \"main\" wine, and that of course turned out to be superb!  Had to try their Corn Soup, with Lobster and Truffle Oil, and that was heavenly! And of course, NO trip to Barrington's is complete without their Fois Gras du jour, and it didn't disappoint! Always marvelous, though the accompanying sauce wasn't the best I've ever had but the Fois Gras was just sublime on its own.  I ordered a \"mid-course\" of their famous Gnocchi with braised Veal, which is TO DIE FOR! If you order ONE thing here, get this dish! It's unique and so richly flavored you'll want to cry....it's THAT good!  For the mains.....my date had the Grouper dish, which normally uses Halibut, but they substituted Grouper, and they got the outside to be deliciously crunchy and the inside soft and moist. I had the Waygu Beef Sirloin which was very tasty, not the absolute best I've had but very good.  Our very professional and friendly waiter recommended the Warm Chocolate Pudding for Dessert. Well this tasted more like a Molten Lava cake than \"pudding\" as the dark chocolate was rich and oh so delicious!  The one big difference since I came last year at this time is that the prices have gone up noticably. The Gnocchi dish was $16 last year and $19 this year. No biggie, but the CORKAGE fee went up from $10 to $30! That's a HUGE increase which I didn't expect. But hey, I did bring a great bottle of wine but that really is a very large jump in price. My bad....I ASSUMED it was still the same price. Lesson Learned....ALWAYS ASK FIRST so that you get NO surprises!  All in all, yet another 5 star experience here!",

At first we were a little surprised at how small it is, but after getting used to that, we found it contributes to the charm. Our server was excellent - very personable and educated. We ordered the mussels and chicken fried calamari for appetizers, bacon wrapped trout and steak for our entrees and split the warm chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was top notch & we ate every single bite. Highly recommend for any occasion where you are looking for a more intimate setting & personalized experience. A+.",

    "text": "This is a place that I wanted to go to for a while now.   PROS: Food really was excellent. I had the chicken and the chocolate lava cake for dessert. Both items have been on the menu for years and they tasted great so I know why.   CONS: This is a tiny restaurant. I mean really tiny for Charlotte standards. Then you get used to it and it feels homey with a neighborhood feel. But that neighborhood is high end South Park where the people who live there act and look like no others in town. It's True, every time I have dinner in a South Park restaurant I keep thinking 'where am I'? Maybe I should get some botox, a Rolex, Hermes scarf, and throw some money around to fit in!   The check- I was in a group of 6 people. The restaurant was full and the service was very slow. There were other tables that came and went when we were still there. They just brought one check and we split it 6 ways (I guess the place is too posh to split out checks). I know that 2 bottles of wine were ordered, and we all had max 2 glasses each. The bill was $77 a person plus tip. My dinner and dessert were $23 + $10. Not sure how the $77 happened unless the wine was super expensive. So I was in for over $90 with the tip. How could that even be worth the money for what I ordered? I will go back again but with just one other person, a date night perhaps and try my luck again.",

My husband had the pea soup to start and was blown away by the flavor. I had the prosciutto pasta and it was creamy and delicious-my only complaint was that it was about half mushrooms! I'm all for using mushrooms as a flavor enhancer, but not when they take up half the bowl. Also nice that they offer half sizes on their pasta dishes so they can double as appetisers as well.  The rest of the meal was equally delicious, as were the desserts - chocolate lava cake and pretzel bread pudding. Would definitely reccomend!",

    "text": "Since Barrington's is very small, we made reservations a couple of weeks in advance for a Saturday night at 8:00 p.m.  I entered our preferred date/time on their website, and they called me back the next day to confirm.  We arrived around 7:15 to have a drink at the bar, which seats maybe 7-8 people.  Luckily, there was room, but it took quite awhile to put in our drink order because the woman who was making drinks also seemed to be the hostess and food runner.  The check-in process there has always seemed a little chaotic to me, maybe even more so because it's such a tiny waiting area?  The drinks - a dirty martini and an espresso martini - were small but solid.  We skipped an appetizer and went right for entrees after we were (fortunately) seated in a booth in the back corner.  As others have said, the seating is tight.  Our waitress was very fun and laid-back, which I appreciate in a \"fancy\" place.    I got the pork chop ($32) medium rare, and it came out... medium rare!  I'm pretty sure this is only the second time a restaurant has ever cooked my pork chop correctly.  I think they get scared and err on the side of medium.  I also appreciated that it came out already sliced in medallions because I'm dangerous with a sharp knife and meat on a bone.  My fella couldn't decide between the flounder and the grouper, and our waitress said to go with the flounder ($35) hands down.  I appreciate a waitress with an opinion!  I'm not a fish-eater, but he said it was delicious, so I'll trust his judgment.    All in all, a great experience... I like a little more elbow room, but I'll deal with the \"intimacy\" to get a great meal!",

    "text": "This place is a remarkable restaurant. I know I haven't been in Charlotte too long, but I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that Barrington's is one of best, if not, THE BEST restaurant in Charlotte (IMO). I almost don't even know where to begin as the entire evening was one big magical experience. This may sound like an exaggeration, but it's not - start to finish every aspect was top notch!  I came here for a birthday dinner this past Saturday. The moment we walked in the door we were greeted by a young lady who took our coats and showed us to our table. As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our waitress who presented us with our menus. Throughout the entire meal, I felt like I had a personal attendant, not a waitress. Every need was predicted, service was flawlessly executed, wine recommendations were personalized and I never felt rushed or inconvenienced in any way. She gets an A+  I told myself as I was driving home that night that I wouldn't turn this review into a novel lol, so I will do my best to keep the review brief and to the point.  Appetizers: French Onion Soup & Bib Lettuce Salad. The soup was not your average French onion soup but it was very very tasty! I would recommend it to ANYONE. Don't ask questions, just order it! The salad was very good, nothing special (I'm not a big salad person - it did have Brussel sprouts...and I LOVEEEE Brussel sprouts.)  Pasta Dish: Gnocchi w/ braised veal. DEAR BABY JESUS...!!!! My buddy Paul C recommended this place and he did say that the Gnocchi is a must and OMG was he right!! Thank you again Paul. Words can't descried how delicious it was. The veal literally melted apart...it was unreal. Since we were each getting an Entree, our waitress suggested getting a \"small\" portion of the Gnocchi - this is the only time of the night in which I regret listening to her...because once the Gnocchi was gone, my mouth was still calling for more lol...oh well, just another reason to come back.    Entrees: I had a couple of bites of the bacon wrapped trout and it was just PHENOMENAL. With some difficulty, I had to decide on whether I was going to go with their veal loin special or their pork chop - I just couldn't make up my mind. What did I end of going with? I decide on their coffee rubbed venison rack LOL. After asking a bunch of questions, I learned from the waitress that the rack was down to only one bone - Pork and veal were out, Venison was in - I couldn't resist. It was perfectly cooked how I asked - Medium rare-ish. I'm literally lost for words as I sit here and write this review. I took my first bite and before I could even put my fork back down...I paused and asked myself...\"Is the real life?\".  It was so unbelievably mouthwatering good. I'm afraid of going back and not getting a chance to try anything else...because I will want the venison again. Ughhhh, it hurts just thinking about it.  By this point in the evening, I was in taste bud heaven. Someone could have given me pretzels and I would remain more than content.   Desert: In a way I'm glad we got a smaller portion of gnocchi because I still had a little bit of room for desert. I had the cheesecake...I believe it was called \"popcorn cheesecake\", maybe? Can't really remember since I felt like I was part of a fairytale by that point. It was DELISCIOUS! Cornbread crust...popcorn pieces...caramel...just perfect. Finshed off with a coffee and baileys.      Thank you to everyone at Barrington's for such a pleasurable experience. I can't wait to come back and do it again. I can now add them to my small list of restaurants that I feel the need to tell everyone about. Thank you again to Paul C for the recommendation - It lived up to everything you said & more.     LONG story LONG, if you want a meal that might just change your life, come to Barington's!",

She ordered the cauliflower soup for appetizer and I opted to get the tagliatelle with toasted prosciutto. It is not an appetizer but figured  we would share it.  Both were delicious. For our main course my cousin got the Catch of the day, which was red snapper. I got the jerk seasoned quail. Both dishes were layered with flavor. The quail had a bean mango salsa with plantains and habanero quail reduction. It was so delicious.  The waiter we had was very nice and attentive.

Speaking of the Bubbly, that's exactly how the night started.  I was with a group for an annual holiday dinner, so several of us enjoyed a delicious celebratory glass, followed by a bottle of Cabernet off of their fabulous wine list.  Seriously, great selection at various price points, so it's worth it to get a bottle.  The food was amazing.  I had the rigatoni to start, but tried the Tagliatelle and Gnocchi that a few others ordered for their main course.  They don't indicate it on the menu, but you can get the pasta in a half or full portion.  Half was more than enough as a shared starter if you just want a small amount.  Good luck choosing between the three pastas, because they were all amazing.  The star of the show for me was the Duck, which was so incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly!  I only wish I could make duck as good as Barrington's.  The only regret I have was not saving room for dessert.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to come back!  Overall, a great experience.  Perfect for a special occasion!  Make sure you call in advance, because this restaurant doesn't have a ton of tables and books up fast!",

With only a handful of tables and a small bar, you and your date will feel like you're the only people in the place, and that's a big part of the charm. The service is excellent and the food delicious -- although not quite as good as I had hoped.  My wife ordered the Salmon, which we both agreed was a bit dry and overcooked. My order of Gnocchi was excellent, covered in a succulent sauce and as flavorful as any pasta dish I've tried. The wine selection was outstanding, but the beer selection is sorely lacking, with just a few macrobrews and one local craft available by the bottle. After dinner, we shared a sumptuous slice of chocolate cake, although the dessert menu on the whole was regrettably limited.   I'd definitely give Barrington's another try, but for the price, it didn't impress nearly as much as we had expected. It certainly has one of the best vibes in Charlotte, and is a great place to show off on a date. But for my money, there are better restaurants in the Queen City.",

After that the cheese appetizer was uninspired and the pasta dishes were not up to par. The tagliatelle pasta was overcooked, and the Rigatoni with a marsala flavored sauce was way too sweet since the marsala was not cooked out.

We arrived at 6:30 for dinner, and after realizing they messed our reservations up they were still able to accommodate us. After being seated Mike, our waiter for the evening, arrived, offered water and explained the wine list. He gave us a few minutes to decide on drinks, of which I chose the French Martini and my Mother a Martini Straight Up. Drinks were definitely solid!  After we were settled with drinks Mike went over the menu, highlighting some of his favorite dishes, some new and those that have been on the menu since opening.  We started with the Calamari two ways, crispy and seared in Indian spices, delicious with a slight kick. In addition to the calamari we had the mussels. Let me just say these were some of the best I have ever had! A light tomato based broth went perfectly with some of the largest mussels and toasted bread served a top, see my photo. As for entrees, we shared the gnocchi and Arctic char. The gnocchi is definite home made and although it is served with mushrooms you feel like you are eating meat, very hearty. The char was cooked to perfection with an amazing crispy skin. I still would love to know how restaurants get fish skin so crispy.  We wrapped the evening up with the chocolate pudding cake, which should be described at a chocolate molten cake, heaven! Served with homemade vanilla bean ice cream.  The ambience is very nice, a perfect setting for a quiet, romantic or special dinner, and service was top notch. Mike was on point, seemed to love his job, which I love seeing, and never missed a beat.  My Mom already asked if we can go there next year for her birthday again. Maybe it'll be our annual dinner.",

I had asked my partner to take me to celebrate my 40th birthday dinner at Barringtons.   Its been a few years since I have dined there.  The service was OK....the server was somewhat attentive .... and her timing was fine....but the vibe wasnt what I had remembered.   She did fine.  She left us alone for the most part.  I had the pan seared scallops.  My dish was cooked to perfection.  As I was nearing the end of my dish....I noticed my partner was really struggling to eat his.    I couldn't figure it out.  He had the Shrimp and Grits.  He said to me \"Im having trouble getting this down\".   I asked why.....and he said the flavor tasted good but the shrimp was a little tough.    I asked to try one of his shrimp.  Much to my dismay....his shrimp were more rubbery than a piece of tire.   I chewed, and I Chewed, And I CHEWED.    .....then I chewed some more.  I told him to send it back....but he insisted I let it go.  He didn't want to make a spectacle of the situation.   In order not to cause any uncomfortable moments, I said nothing.  While the food is on the pricey side....I hated for the shrimp to go to waste.   I ate 3 (because I can pretty much eat anything)....while he finished the rest of the grits.  All in all, our expereince was not bad or horrible .....but for a fine dining experience.....we were just a little let down.    I am not sure I would return.   Things just dont seem like I remember them.",

The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable. The foie gras melts in your mouth and tuna tar tar was exceptional. Please don't get me started with the seared scallops or the duck breast served with pickled carrots and veggies.  The flavors and culinary experience wouldn't fit on this comment space.

Four our entree's my daughter had the braised short ribs and I had the pork chop.  Both were beyond expectations and first time I've seen a pork chop sliced and served against the bone; great idea and presentation was top notch.  We decided to give the trio of cream brulee a whirl for our dessert and we should of skipped that.  A trio of Peanut Butter, white chocolate and banana.  The banana tasted like smashed bananas and the peanut butter and white chocolate were just OK.  The service was great, food was hot and overall a great evening for us foodies!",

You see my good friend and I worked for Bruce in his early restaurant days at Pizza Villa over 20 years ago and were shocked to hear that he bought the place 18 years ago and was recognized as having some of the best food Charlotte has to offer!!  Where does the time go?  Anyway - I had the Pecan crusted pork tenderloin and my friend had the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  He also had the Arugula salad with bleu cheese and we each had the French Onion soup.  All of it was outrageously delicious and we will definitely be returning for a future special occasion.

In total, there were only 9 groups in the entire place and they were at capacity and we were less than a foot away from the group dining next to us (who were rather uppity and kept looking at us as if we were intruding on their dining experience by sitting near them) so I understand why they require reservations.   I would say the average age of the people dining was around 50-60+.  I felt a little young being there, but I wasn't treated that way by the staff, it was more from the patrons, who I think were a little full of themselves (most had that 'I'm SO important' vibe going on.)    I did not get the pretentious air at all from the staff that I was expecting while I was at the restaurant, but I did while making the reservation (don't contact them online or leave a message, they don't call you back and the people on the phone aren't very pleasant -they were even snippy when we called to confirm the reservation).    I had the shrimp with the cole slaw and corn bread for an appetizer.  While it sounds like an odd mix, I was actually sad when I finished it.  I don't even like cole slaw and I was tempted to start licking my plate just to get the last parts that I couldn't pick up with my fork.  For my main course I had the chicken with spinach and mashed potatoes.  Yum. Yum. Yum.  Everything had so much flavor and tasted fresh.  All of us at the table ordered something different and every serving was met with mmm's to near moaning so I think my entire party was pleased with their meal. The food is excellent and the portions are large (the mussels appetizer could be a meal) so you aren't left feeling hungry and bitter and when the $$$ check shows up.  We never felt rushed and the evening was very relaxing and pleasant.  We even got to meet the chef/owner Bruce, who is very friendly, which was an added plus.",

    "text": "We really wanted to love Barrington's - truly we did - but we were disappointed on a recent visit...the negatives far outweighed the positives.  positives:  charming setting, excellent service...friendly, attentive, and gracious without being pretentious, quality ingredients, and a few high spots:  wonderful fresh corn soup with lobster, beautifully cooked and delicate veal tenderloin, good bread with a nice quality olive oil and balsamic dip. negatives:  Dishes were almost universally oversalted (particularly the breading on the crispy quail, but also the gnocchi with its ragu of veal and porcini);  the sesame crust on our foie gras was burned, our waitress told us that the kitchen's kale was a \"little\" spicy --- holy heat!  the kale was hot enough to kill the delicate flavor of that  beautifully cooked sliced veal tenderloin;  the veal and porcini sauce was extremely heavy, the veal pieces tasted like overcooked stew meat, and far too much Parmesan was grated on top.  Plus, the restaurant's noise level makes conversation almost impossible.    Wish we could give a higher rating.  P.S.  A recent visit to their sister restaurant (Good Food on Montford) gave us a uniformly superior experience with no significant negatives.  We hope that our dinner at Barrington's was just an anomaly, but, as the saying goes, you are only as good as your last croissant.",

    "text": "Despite the wonderful and top notch food, I doubt we will be back.  The service was ok, when I asked for my mixed green salad without turnips the waitress challenged me that I should get them.  I politely re-requested that my salad be served the way I requested.  We were rushed to order entrees along with our bottle of  wine.  Seemed like they were in a rush to turn over our table which they were success at since we were out in an hour.  Now we choose to go elsewhere for dessert since the noise level in the restaurant was so high I couldn't hear my husband talk.  I can't fault the chef, the food was wonderful but when I go out for a quality dinner, I don't want to be rushed and I would like to hear the conversation of those I am with.  Lots of other options in charlotte.",

    "text": "This is the best restauraunt I have eaten at in Charlotte. The food is really world class. The small 20 table dining room really makes it feel very warm and personable. Chef Bruce Moffett really pays attention to detail when preparing his dishes. Their signature starter in my oppinion are the mussels, very simple, and have always been perfectly cooked. You can't go wrong wrong with any of the main dishes, I especially like the roasted Halibut, and this is a restauraunt worth ordering the chicken dish(pan seared with creamy potatoes, sounds plain but is very delicious). The Veal and Porcini Gnocchi are also worth a try. You can not beat Barrington's for any special occasion.",
