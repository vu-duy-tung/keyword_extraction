You can either sit at formal tables or at high tops in the bar area. I've done both but this time we were in the formal dining room. Their signature dish is sake marinated Chilean sea bass and as always it didn't disappoint. I had a steamed lobster, very nice we also had sushi bento box, salmon sashimi and calamari. Well enough about the food, the service was great, informative, friendly and efficient. If you are in Charlotte have a fair bit of credit on your credit card I recommend trying this fine restaurant.",

    "text": "Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable. What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths?   My favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies.   At the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)",

    "text": "My girl and I came here for their Sunday brunch to enjoy the seafood and hang out with new friends.  While the decor of the restaurant and the service was quite good, it's in the food category where this place was severely lacking.  The way they do their brunch is buffet style with an assortment of stations which are self serve and two manned stations, one for carving and another for omelets.  Pretty standard setup.  Along with the buffet they had unlimited tapas that could be ordered for the table.  Meeting our friends there for a Sunday bite was nice.  The table was comfortable, the atmosphere up scale and everyone was generally pleasant.  That's the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars.  The buffet suffered from the one cardinal sin of any buffet type offering, the food was left out too long.  Congealed mac & cheese, sushi with crunchy rice and sausage that had been dried out from being exposed for so long.  On top of that, none of the shrimp had been cleaned.  Not the large cold shrimp with cocktail sauce or the small shrimp tossed into the omelets.  That's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber.  Honestly, I'd rather do the brunch at the Ballantyne Resort.  This place was not worth the money and with such a poor showing I won't even try them for dinner.",

    "text": "Oh upstream how I love thee. Why am I writing yet another update with the same rating as the ones before you ask? So I can tell you about the brunch of course. This brunch is a monster of a buffet and tapas menu combined all for the low price of $25! Hold on you might be balking at the hefty sticker tag on this brunch but let me tell you about all the stuff you can well...stuff yourself with and you'll be singing praises too after you try this joint out.  This being one of my last weekends in Charlotte the boyfriend and I went with a yelpy crew consisting of Travis W., Melissa B., Chad E., And Denise. First off you walk in get greeted and led to your table and handed a nice tapas menu. They could've charged $7-10 for most of the items on this tapas menu and made a killing but nope they're giving it to you as part of the buffet, score! I tried the scallop risotto, crab benedict, belgian waffle, and some other things all excellent! But wait it doesn't stop there you walk into the bar area and BAM! you're hit with a massive buffet of brunch items. You want some smoked salmon and mushrooms folded into your freshly made omelet? No problem. Add some excellently carved prime rib onto that you got some good eats. I was so full before I even got halfway through working on this buffet.  This place has met my expectations for lunch, dinner, and now brunch. Hopefully I am back in Charlotte soon to give it another whirl. Though dinner is a bit expensive and they do need to tell you the prices of the specials lest you order a $45 bento box like I did, the staff is incredibly accomodating and attentive to your needs. Hell they even remembered my name and how I like my tea for lunch after the second time I was there! Give it a try, you can thank me later.",

Although the presentation was beautiful, it definitely wasn't that spectacular.

Having said this, my friends really enjoyed their lunches so I am willing to give it another try when the opportunity presents itself.",

The restaurant is pretty fancy so wear something nice.  For Sunday's brunch they have a tapas menu with great fresh options IN ADDITION TO the biggest brunch buffet you have ever seen.  The tapas we had were scallop risotto (oh - so THIS is what it is supposed to taste like!!!), Belgian waffles, and the crab-cake.  All of these are complimentary with the buffet so get them all!    All of it was so good - but then you have to go to the buffet.  I was so overwhelmed!!!    Buffet:  Pastries galore, fresh fruit, cheese, grilled chilled veggies, salmon wraps, red skin potato salad with bacon dressing, deli meats, omelet bar, shrimp and grits, baked salmon, roast beef, baked ziti, broccoli and cheese, fried chicken, ribs, sushi, shrimp, clams, oysters, mousse, tarts, bread pudding i - that is all i can remember.  They had to roll us out of there.    Yes it costs $25 bucks but it is WORTH EVERY PENNY.  The food was so fresh and delicious!!!  Mimosas and other cocktails (must wait till noon!) were $5 and the perfect complement.  Can't wait to go back!  It is fantastic!",

I adore the look before the renovations. I have to come back and see what they have done to the new bar.  I just love the atmosphere here.  Food - their selection of food are fresh and delicious.  My husband and I came here for his birthday. He ordered the steak and he loved it. I ordered the mussels which were great and crab cakes that was outstanding. The one thing that got us to come back, was the Costa Rican chocolate that was amazingly decadent. We were told that they have an in house French pastry background chef that makes this. Superb!  So, we would come back here, this time, to the bar to enjoy the chocolate dessert and some fresh earl grey tea (no tea bags found here!).  We came back here again with different friends, had the sushi, which is good.   Service - we forgot our waiter's name, it's been so long.. But he was awesome and took care of us! The service by the bar was great also. Service outside the venue, out on the patio like area was good. My friends and I spent a good amount of time, eating sushi, and enjoying our desserts. Wine selection was great!  Just wished for a little more lighting outside. Just a bit more, underneath the umbrellas.",

The bar or outside seating is perfect for a relaxing evening to enjoy some people watching. Dining room seating usually tends to take longer and the servers aren't as attentive, definitely not good for a quick lunch.   Appetizers to try are; the cheese plate, Sweet & Sour Calamari (my fav) and their Mussel Pot. They have a great sushi selection, I normally have their Spider and Firecracker Roll which is always fresh and perfect. I recently tried their Queen City Roll and its absolutely delicious paired with a glass of Conundrum. The mashed potatoes and baby green beans are a great side dish for any of their menu items. Also, try their bread pudding dessert when they have it on the menu, it's the best in town.",

    "text": "Great brunch! I'm looking forward to going back for dinner at some point in the near future. We made a reservation for 11:45am because I'd read that the wait can be long. When we arrived, there were plenty of open tables and no one waiting. We were seated right away...and then waited for at least 5 minutes with servers constantly walking by before anyone stopped to take our drink order. Then, after the first server came by and explained the concept, four or five servers came over and tried to do the same. This was really the only misstep for us.   We ordered several items off the brunch tapas menu - egg benedict, steak & egg, waffle, pecan crusted trout, and the french toast. They were all good. Then we made our way to the buffet area. The highlights for me where the shrimp and grits, macaroni & cheese, cod, sushi, fruit/cheese, and mussels & clams. Not as great were the peel & eat shrimp (which were slightly hard, but that may have been from sitting on ice for awhile.) I wasn't wild about the cocktail sauce, which had a definite orange taste to it. Also, the salmon from the carving station was just okay.  I'm a Bloody Mary enthusiast and Upstream's was not my favorite. It was by no means undrinkable, but the mix lacked the seasoning and toppings/snacks that make a great Bloody Mary.  The dessert bar offered a great variety of dessert bites - my favorites were the marshmallow/smore on a stick, lemon square, and the pecan tart.  All in all we'll go again, skip the Bloody Mary and focus just on the highlights. I'm also excited to try their dinner and Happy Hour Bar Bites menu.",

    "text": "So, I've always longed to go to Upstream, but it's definitely out of my price range. Much to my excitement, I won a gift card in a charity fundraiser at work that allowed me to pay them a visit and taste what I might be missing.  My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday evening at 5:30. We figured we'd miss the crowds that way, and sure enough, it was much emptier than I expected after reading all the reviews. We were promptly seated - the decor was very classy, but not in an overdone way.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. He made some very detailed recommendations of food and wine that were accurate, and his subtle jokes and jabs made us feel like we were chatting with a good friend.  We started off with the chef's choice of oysters - 6 of them. They were delicious but also very small, and I wasn't feeling like we got our money's worth at all. Maybe it was because they were East Coast? Regardless, I wouldn't buy them at that price again.  I was jonesin' for some Asian flair, so I my chosen entree was the Togarashi Dusted Big-Eye Tuna, rare. The tuna was tasty and high quality, and the sauce it was in was pleasurably tangy. The waiter had told me to expect it to be spicy, but I didn't find it spicy at all - maybe the seasoning on the tuna had a subtle kick, but not much. What surprised me most was the rice cake. I was almost as excited about it as the tuna, which is definitely not something I expect for rice! It is a clump of sushi rice that is quickly dipped into a flash-fryer to crisp the outside into something so perfect that I'm considering buying a fryer just to try to replicate it. Combined with the sauce, it was divine. My one complaint about the dish was the pickled veggies that are stacked on top. I thought the sauce was super tangy all by itself - the pickled flavor was just all too much. I couldn't eat them. But I cleaned the rest of my plate happily!  My boyfriend got the Scottish Salmon, which he also really enjoyed, especially the curry sauce that went along with it. He cleaned his plate completely! He is gluten allergic, and the waiter was very patient to go through the whole menu with him in detail and let him know what could be made gluten-free. They do not have a separate gluten-free menu.  Our bill came out rather high - 2 glasses of wine, 6 oysters, and 2 main courses came out at $90. We weren't concerned with the gift card in tow, but even with the great quality, it seemed kind of steep.  All in all, if you think a well-rounded meal for 2 at $90 is nothing to sneeze at, then by all means, visit Upstream! Otherwise, I'd save it for a special occasion.",

Also their tuna (maguro) sashimi was really fresh and delicious. By the way you have to ask to see their sushi menu. For dessert we got the vanilla creme Brule and chocolate tort with gelato.

Great service from the staff, starting from the hostess who brough us to a semi-private booth to the waitress explaining the buffet and cooked-to-order process and even the busboy who refilled our water glasses. I thought it was interesting that the waitstaff was all dressed like chefs - I don't know if that's intentional or not, but I liked it.  As for the food, well, it was excellent! The usual buffet staples like a cooked-to-order omelet station and a slicing station. But also a huge raw bar with large prawns, oysters, clams and mussels. On another table, salads and savories and sweet treats. Bacon and grits and smoked salmon and fresh sushi more!  But where the brunch stands out is the tapas menu. From your waiter/waitress, you order delicious plates that are a perfect little bite. Egg benedict - one poached egg on a crab cake. Smoked fish tacos - a 2 inch corn tortilla filled with smoked fish with guacamole and salsa on the side. Belgian waffles. French toast. Oh, I am stuffed!  Parking in Philips Place isn't easy but Upstream sometimes offers complimentary valet parking. It's well worth the tip to save the headache of finding a spot in the parking deck.",

I expected a little more food to appear on my plate when the entree came, but the taste was standard and typical of a seafood restaurant that serves steak.  Prices are a little steep for the serving size, but the ambiance and service makes up for it.   Give them a try!",

I think their biggest mistake was not to give you something mid meal to clean your pallet. I have a taste of everything I had and I'm not comfortable with that when paying a high price.  my wife and I and my father had the sea scallops and they were grey and under-cooked. As an appetizer I had the squid which was in a creamy sweet and sour sauce which I won't even attempt again, I think this is what ruined my meal. Just the flavor went through the whole meal.  Overall not a very good experience for me and I do not plan on visiting this establishment again.",

The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...  We ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were \"slightly undercooked\" and he was \"trained that most food was sushi grade.\" Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good.   Lastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.  I can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.  Prices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts.",

    "text": "Went to Upstream after finding it listed on an OpenTable Valentine's Day restaurant list.  Decided to take my girlfriend there on 15 FEB (avoid the rush) as she loves seafood.  Should have probably read the Yelp reviews before, but hey...   Anyway, we arrived at 19:35, five minutes after our reservation time.  Hostess sat us within ten minutes of arrival at a booth.  We ordered oysters and wine to start things off.  The half-dozen oysters (Chef's Selection) was good - the New York oysters were our favorites.  Wine is definitely overpriced at this plate, especially considering how little they give you!  We were very happy our visit coincided with half-price wine night, as that made the prices fall back to the \"reasonable but still high\" range.    For dinner, we tried the pecan crusted trout and the lobster special.  The wait was long, but the pecan crusted trout was well worth it - good meat with a good crust!  The lobster was a disappointment as it was overcooked.  We called the waiter over, and he promised to bring us a new one quickly.  Within ten minutes, we had a new lobster that was cooked more reasonably.    As compensation for the overcooked lobster, the manager comp'ed us a dessert.  We tried the passion fruit creme brulee which was quite nice.  Total bill came to $105 (dessert was comp'ed).    I would say that this restaurant is overrated for what it is.  While I like seafood, I think I can find it more reasonably priced elsewhere in Charlotte.  Ambiance was nice, but not worth the extra cost.",

THE good: on the list of top Charlotte brunch experiences,  upstream holds the number one spot for me. They allowed my friends to make me feel amazing.  Known as an oyster bar- their excellent buffet food (Sunday before 4) bar is accompanied by amazing staff and beautiful decor.  I was delighted by the small plates and feeling great after 2 mimosas. My favorite were the oysters and crab cakes.   My eggs even can sunny side up (win).  The other good: this Charlotte favorite isn't a secret-upstream is for a mature audience and it was also the choice location for a retirement party in a private room.   Despite the large crowd of important people in other parties - our dedicated waitress showed us amazing customer service.   Can't wait to take my mom for Mother's Day.",

We arrived about 7:15 ish and it was not crowded and we grabbed 2 seats at the bar- next to the service bar area.  We waited...waited some more and at one point there was NO ONE behind the bar.  In addition, there was a server that would wander behind the bar and she didn't even acknowledge us.  Eventually we were greeted by a bar tender. I told her we had been sitting there for a bit and she explained that they were \"under staffed\"-    A few minutes later the manager came by and we explained what was going on.  We ordered edamame and it came out timely..but with DIRTY PLATES....I pushed the plates towards the bar.....I was a bit disgusted and we ate the food right from the container it was delivered in.  After what was too long of a wait for a restaurant that was NOT crowded my husbands duck came out cold.  I am not sure what it going on but it just seems that there is not the caliber of service or management as there used to be.    We ask that you address the above matters and bring Upstream back up to the dining experience that is used to be.  I am afraid to say that we will not be back for a while",

The all you can eat buffet is pricey ($40) but I think I ate that much in oysters alone.  Offerings ran the gamete from delicious looking cheese plates and salads (I say looking because I didn't sample - saving my stomach space for...) the raw bar, mussels, clams, crab legs, oysters, shrimp, smoked salmon, several types of sushi.....etc etc etc.  Also five carving stations including traditional turkey but ranging to delicious Scottish salmon. Sides were a star, I loved the stuffing with duck sausage and the unexpected pairing of butternut squash and cherries. Also, the shrimp and grits. I went back just for a bowl-full.  Desserts were lovely but not as epic as the raw bar and included an actual gelato cart rolled in for the occasion, bread pudding, cobblers, blondies, pie - you know the drill its Thanksgiving, roll out of there.  Service was conscientious and over the top helpful in a non-cloying not-fake way.  i've had many a nice meal at Upstream over the years and they really out did themselves with their Thanksgiving buffet.",

We got the clams (so small and no dipping sauce), the sea bass appetizer (again small AND served in a plastic bag), the scallops entree which was so small and has a horrible flavor, and the halibut which was admittedly the best dish of the night. The bartender did not refresh my husband's ice cube when he ordered a second old fashioned but put a second one on top of the previous one (I know this might seem trivial but it just added to the overall poor experience). A couple who sat down next to us seemed equally disappointed in the menu change. Overall it was a terrible night and I hate we spent $175 on a meal we hated and left hungry and went somewhere else to eat. Hopefully they'll revert back to the old menu as the new Japanese fusion menu they're trying leaves a ton to be desired.",

Loved the bread, the dipping oil was very tasty and I also asked for some butter and that added even more flavor to the bread.   The Flounder with Risotto was perfectly prepared and just the right amount of food to risotto ratio.  The sauce over the entree was a great accompaniment to the fish and risotto.

(i'm not a great salmon fan.)  the rest of my party enjoyed dishes like the calamari appetizer and the entrees Mediterranean whole sea bass and grilled filet.  there also was a nice touch where you could mix and match fish, sauce, and a side (i think it was called 'simply sides').  the wine list was considered very good by the oenophiles in the room.  it was overall a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "Giving this place 3 stars mostly for the service and the calamari appetizer which were both excellent.  I ordered the Tuna steak with Jasmine rice.  It was good, not great.  Pretty much just a piece of fish with no seasoning and zero effort was made on plate presentation   I asked for some wasabi oil and that at least gave it a bit of flavor.  My date had the Mahi Mahi with butter which I tasted and it did have a nice flavor to it.  I thought the place was bit pricey for what they were serving up which was nothing fancy.  The outside dining overlooked a retail store and their track lighting spot lights were way to bright for dinner.  I don't know the dining scene in Charlotte too well as I was visiting, but I did read a lot of favorable reviews for this place so maybe compared to other places in Charlotte this is a real treat for the locals.  I probably would not go back.",

    "text": "I have been going to Upstream for the past 15 years and cannot believe I have not written a review yet.  Years ago this was my go to spot for Seafood.  However, over the last few years I have tried so many of the newer places I haven't gotten back here in a while, and that was my bad.  A few months ago I met up for drinks and appetizers with a Meetup Group and enjoyed the updated bar and offerings.  Although I have seen better Happy Hour prices, the food and drinks were great! I enjoyed the Shrimp Tempura, it was cooked to perfection. A light batter with an amazing sauce.  The sushi was great as well, and the others I was with enjoyed their choices as well.  After being impressed with the food I have since been back for dinner and just this past weekend enjoyed Easter Brunch.  Let me say Upstream offers a great brunch.  Not only do they have a spread, and I mean an entire room, of salads, shellfish, carving stations, hot meals and desserts, they also offer a la carte entrees that can be served individually and brought to your table hot from the kitchen. Some of those items included a trout/crab cake benedict, shrimp and grtis, veggie frittata, and a few more.  The food was all delicous and the service was spot on.  It seemed Upstream was very organized for this day and I will look forward to getting back again soon.",

I now crave the Green Papaya salad and the Chicken Karaage. They cook amazing duck for that salad and who knew fried chicken could be so tasty with a Japanese flair! The Bronzino was light but flavorful.  Krispy Fish and Pork Belly wraps were amazing and the portions were generous. We also tried The Rock, sliced NY strip you cook on a piping hot rock at the table. My husband ordered a second one it was so fun and tender! The Hot to Trot cocktail kept me ordering more and wondering why we waited so long to get out and give the new chef a whirl. Cheers!",

We tried to make same day reservations, but with it being restaurant week they were fully booked. However, the lady I talked to on the phone said since there's only 2 of us we shouldn't have a problem finding a seat in the bar/lounge area and the earlier we get there the better. Glad she told us this because we probably wouldn't have gone had she not being we live like 40 mins away. We got there around 6 and there was plenty of seating both at the bar and tables in the lounge. I started with the spicy salmon roll, had the lobster for entree which came with potatoes & a small salad with some type of vinegarette and apple crumble for dessert. All were very good! My friend stated her crab cakes were average and had too much breading - I tried some of the chocolate ganache she had for desert and that was yummy! Service was excellent as well 5/5. Will definitely back!",

We ordered the Lump Crab cakes, the Dug Potatoes with asparagus, Sea Bass, and Salmon. All incredible - in flavor, proportions, plating, temperature.   Each dish had its own flavor theme, and they were reproduced flawlessly. Nothing had too much garlic, too much ginger or any mistake.   This is hard to do: run a kitchen with quality food (especially fish) and quality versions to the table each time.  I will return here, and even enroll in the cooking classes they offer!",

My husband and I take Datenight seriously as we have 2 teenage daughters & a toddler son so anytime alone away from home is very appreciated to just catch up with each other outside of our busy family schedule and work.   We were excited to try Upstream during Queen Fest Week (Restaurant Week) and the service was subpar to be frank. We were not treated as we expected in such an establishment. We were dressed to that nines and excited to be out. I even made the reservations on OpenTable as I always do when the restaurant is on opentabel and added notes about it being Datenight for my hubby and I. I'm use to restaurants reading notes to take into consideration any special request or to just see if they could get some info on the patrons coming into the establishment and acknowledging them accordingly. This was not the case for us and even after sharing with our server while asking about bottles of wine he still acted unenthused (lol) don't get me wrong I'm not looking for a parade or streamers for being on Datenight I just thought it would make the server smile or chop up some small talk (it ALWAYS does at various restaurant with really good service).  The cost to eat at this place to me warrants some type of happiness in the service as they are there in a position to service customer which is customer service and they should be a little bit appreciative for having work as so many don't. The food was not very good to my husband and I. Maybe we had a bad taste in our mouth already. We both vowed to try this place again to give them a fair go.  Once we do I will update my review (Addendum) accordingly.",

The manager came out to discuss the reason for roe and didn't seem to grasp their diet. Dinner was incredibly slow to get to us for an otherwise not busy night. Food was mediocre at best. Curried potatoes had little to no curry flavor.   Overall will not suggest the restaurant. For the price there's better places in charlotte.",

I am not Rachel Ray.The sushi was decent. The prime rib was tough. Some of the oysters were slimy. The Bloody Mary's are small and average.  The breakfast basics were good. You can order things from the Tapas menu that are included. The crab cake benedict was good. I am using short sentences in this review. Can you order tapas more than once? I don't know. Our waitress only asked once. Tapas selection looked better than buffet. We still tipped generously. Why? Because we are cool people. We appreciate the service of others even though it may be lacking at times.   In summary. Okay. Not great. Not terrible. Average brunch. Average Charlotte price. Our server - not so hot. Brunch at Georges Brasserie is wayyyy better. No I am not an employee there.  The end.",

I did so because the entire menu looked fabulous, and actually had desserts that I could eat despite my egg allergy. I did not expect to be blown away.  Three courses was all it took to make me a believer. Actually, it only took one, but I insisted on continuing to eat.   The starter that left me speechless was the curried cauliflower soup. I contemplated asking for a gallon to take home, but didn't want to take their entire stock. It was that good!!! There were scallops, perfectly creamy cauliflower, and fried onions on top. My goodness, I'm craving it now.  My main course was a beautiful braised short rib dish with creamy squash and grilled boy choy. The portion was spot on, but I made sure it lasted so that I could savor each flavor. The short rib was tender, so tender that it fell off the bone, and the squash was a welcome accompaniment. The bok choy however, superb! How could a vegetable stand up to the protein on the plate? I don't know, but it did!  The third course was an apple strudel, alas it wasn't what I asked for, but when they put it on my table...I didn't complain. It smelled divine and tasted like heaven. Gosh. I need to go back ASAP. Highly recommended!",

Here are a few of the highlights for me:  -Made to Order Omelets -Salmon -Steak and Eggs -Fish tacos -Waffles -Shrimp and Grits (sooooo good) -Fried chicken -Ribs -Bacon and Sausage -Mac and Cheese -French Toast  As if that weren't enough you also get your choice of salads, sushi, fruits and if there's any room left they even have desserts!

Many patrons had on jeans and one dude was wearing shorts...so next time I'll be a little less dressy and a little more comfortable.",

We shared the oyster salad and not just standard Calamari, but sweet and sour calamari, which was very unique and tasty. For the main course I had the Sea bass and my dinner date had the lobster, both were fantastic! The best part of the dinner was our waiter, Yekta, who was one of the best waiters I've ever had. I can't wait to come back and I'll definitely be requesting Yekta for our waiter.",

    "text": "This is a review for my last night Restaurant Week dinner. And I am torn about how many stars I should give. Here is the thing, the service wasn't great, but as crazy as it sounds, it was the best bad service I ever had.  RSVP for 2 at 7:45pm, my friend and I arrived on time (gasp!). Hostess said there's a booth for us, but then she changed her observation (to no booth). We offered to wait in the bar area if that's easier, but she pretty much told us they've been behind on schedule and best for us to not miss a table when one is available. We stood around for a few minutes awkwardly (my friend was desperately needing a drink apparently), and finally we got sat in the 1st side room on the left, at a 4-top (with only 2 chairs) toward the back, next to a party of 10.  Water person (what's the PC term for water boy?) came and filled our glasses. And that was as much action as we received for 10+ minutes. It's starting to bring back the memory of my Fahrenheit nightmare. Ironically I'm with the same friend! I think he and I and fine dining just don't belong together. Meanwhile the 2 waiters assigned to tables around us just came and gone and never even batted an eye at us. I finally waved down the water person and softly asked him \"who's our waiter?\"   My simple question led to an array of apologies. Manager showed up and offered us drinks and brought us menu. We got assigned a waiter, we placed an order of the chef's choice half dozen oysters and the night slowly proceeded. By slowly, I meant we didn't finally leave the restaurant until 10 to 10pm. Thank goodness the 2 of us have known each other for years, and had plenty to chat about. It would have killed any potential if it was a 1st date situation. Imagine the silence...  Food wise the RW menu was solid. There are plenty of options (and not just salad). Essentially the entire menu was up for grab, some involves up-charge. I personally was perfectly fine with my seafood soup (it's not very curry, don't let the name scares you), my 1-lb lobster (split in half, and amazingly they left all the brainy gooey goodness for me to tear into, though some may argue the meat itself was a little overcooked) and creme brulee. It definitely worths the $30. My friend had the NC shrimp salad (huge portion, not sure if I liked the dressing, but it's whole shrimps on greens), seared tuna over rice cake (definitely digging the rice cake), and flourless chocolate tart and ice cream. Tuna has a small up-charge (I'm thinking $6).  At the end, they pretty much comp everything but our dinner. 2 managers have repeatedly apologized for the service. I couldn't even be mad at anyone. I guess if I'm to have bad service, it's best when they owe up to it and try hard to make up for it without me even having to ask. We didn't expect them to comp ALL the drinks (I only had 2 glasses of wine, but my friend went all out on his double vodka tonic). We made it up on tip because it's not our server's fault.  So at the end, it was a good night and a great dinner. I decided that 4-star is deserving given the circumstance.   Food - 4 Value - 5 (for Restaurant Week) Service - 2 Afford - 5 (lol)",

    "text": "It had been a while for me and Upstream hanging out together. We had broken up over brunch one Sunday, but I was ready to give them another chance for dinner.  I was here for a business dinner and all in all it was a pleasant experience for everyone. The menu is seafood heavy and we wound up ordering calamari and mussels to share. The tomato sauce for the mussels was some of the best that I have had in a long time. The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari.  For entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \"Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette. I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here. They were busy on the weeknight that we stopped by so there were a lot of servers running around.  So I guess that my relationship with Upstream is back on again, but I think that we can both agree that it's ok for us to see other people as well.",

    "text": "I brought my partner to Upstream for his first visit.  We had a table in the middle of the dining room.  I love the look and decor of Upstream (especially the ceiling!) so this felt very cozy.  The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level.  There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen.  I understand (and enjoy!) the concept of \"open kitchen\" dining, but I think that should be reserved for different types of restaurants.  The open kitchen didn't feel right for an upscale seafood restaurant that can/should be used for special occasions and dates.    Anyway, we had fantastic service.  Just be prepared to enjoy an hour and a half relaxing meal.  To start, we tried the bento box appetizer, which was a combination of different things (sashimi, sushi, beef, eggroll), but I think next time I would go with just a couple of sushi rolls.  We also splurged and added the flash-fried calamari as it sounded so good when our server was describing it to us.  And she was right.  It was very tasty and not at all chewy. It also didn't include the baby squids with attached tentacles that you might normally find in calamari dishes.  The only disappointing thing was the portion size.  Good thing we got the bento box, too!  I ordered the sea scallops for my entree and chose the Japanese ponzu sauce (there are 5 choices!) to go with it.  The three tennis ball-sized scallops had a LOT of flavor to them and the fingerling potatoes on the side were tasty, too.  Again, though, the portion was pretty small, but with all things added up, we were full by the end of our meal.    All in all, we had a very enjoyable experience, but I can't say that when thinking of places to go in the future, I'd return anytime soon.  There are so many other options out there and Upstream didn't \"wow\" us enough to return time and time again.",

The sushi rolls were mediocre at best and their version of New Style sashimi was pretty terrible. It was basically dried out, overly thin and the flavor was not good.   The only saving grace was that it was happy hour and according to the menu the items marked with an * were half price.... Or so I thought until the bill came. Turns out the sushi menu is very misleading and it was full price which amounted to just less than $90 for two rolls, a poorly prepared salmon sashimi and half dozen oysters which I left the selection to the server who of course picked the \"non happy hour\" ones...  I've paid $200 for omakase at sushi restaurants out west and happy to do so if the quality is right but this was way off the mark.   Definitely wouldn't recommend as I assume there must be better quality sushi in the Charlotte area.   I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the service from the waitsatff was very good despite the food.",

The first table the hostess attempted to seat us at was crammed in the bar right on top of the adjoining table. We asked for something different and we were rudely forced to wait. Once we were finally seated, we were ignored by the wait staff for 15 minutes before someone stopped to ask if we wanted a beverage, but we had no beverage menu. I guess we were supposed to just guess at what was available. Again, we were ignored by the wait staff over and over and over again while they hustled around to the surrounding tables. When our waiter finally realized we had been there over 30 minutes without so much as a greeting, he did apologize but he continued to pay extra attention to every other table but ours. The meal was buffet, and every time we went in for a serving - the dishes were cold and empty! We waited time and time again for more dishes to be brought out but almost everything was cold in the serving trays. Oh, and the prime rib was RAW! I love Rare prime rib - but this was RAW! Save your money! We $150 for 2 people and it was not worth the money! If you were looking for very subpar food and service - by all means enjoy. My husband will not be returning. Ever.",

(I still think he gets an A for effort, no?) We were pleasantly surprised that we could walk in and eat in their cozy bar area, which to me, was just as good as sitting in the dining area. What a great option!  Our server was courteous, professional, and prompt. She truly knew her stuff and was very patient when it came to questions about the wine and strong pairings. We shared a nice bottle of wine; he enjoyed clams as an appetizer and I the Lobster Bisque. For our entrees, I had the Scallop Pad Thai and he the Tuna. All we cooked to perfection with really strong infusions and personality. It's very apparent that the Executive Chef really has a talent and is extremely accomplished and takes the considerations of his food and creations quite seriously. The presentation was spot on and it was extremely apparent that the food was made with very fresh ingredients. Ever have a meal where you just feel heavy? Though I did a number on my entree, I left feeling content and truly satisfied.  What sold me on why I will always be a fan and look forward to return visits is how their management team responded to an 'incident'. During our appetizer, my boyfriend chipped his tooth while eating clams, as a clam was not shucked just right. The server and manager offered their deep, True apologies and then offered to take care of any dental fixes. I was really impressed by they're concern and jumping right into to offer a fix. Bravo!",

Everything was super fresh,  our Waiter was totally on the ball and the perfect mesh of attentive without being intrusive, plus he totally didn't judge me for my third order of french toast.  *I* judged me, but it was too good to care \"Look away, I am going to lick my plate now...\"  I don't think there was a single thing I didn't love and the fresh omelette was sooo good.  The veggies were all perfectly cooked and super fresh.  My friends and I have agreed, this is now a weekly tradition that we intend to diet the rest of the week for.  Side note: The food was so good even my picky four year old sat quietly and ate.",

    "text": "Since the closing of LaVecchia's Seafood Grille, my thirst for upscale seafood in the Queen City has gone largely unquenched.  That is, until now, when I had the chance to go to Upstream this past Thursday evening for dinner with my dad.  Food:  In case it hasn't dawned on you yet, this is mostly a seafood spot.  Therefore you should probably at least have a taste for good, fresh, seafood before dining at Upstream.  To begin with, we ordered a trio of appetizers - the Sweet and Sour Calamari, Lump Crab Cakes, and the Black Iron Mussel Pot.  All of the appetizers were different than similar renditions I've had of these popular seafood dishes.  The calamari was not your traditional fried and breaded calamari.  Instead, the calamari was pan seared, not breaded at all, and served tossed in a thick sweet and sour sauce - very tasty!  I loved the MUSSELS!  The tomato-garlic sauce the mussels are served in suited me perfectly.  The crab cakes were probably my least favorite of the apps - they were good, just not great.    We split the salmon for our main course.  The salmon was, in a word, flawless. It was super tender, succulent and bursting with flavor! The pearl pasta and scallops it was served on top of, was the perfect compliment.    Ambiance:  As we were able to be seated right away, we really did not have a chance to tour the restaurant that much.  But from what we were exposed to, I certainly have no complaints.  Quiet, classy, upscale, friendly, chic, are all adjectives that come to mind when I think of the ambiance at Upstream.    Service:  Let me just say, our server, Brooke, was super friendly and was one of the most professional, knowledgeable servers I've ever encountered.  She was knew the menu from front to back.  She was willing to accommodate any request we might have.  The only thing that topped the delicious food was the unforgettable service.    I think my seafood crusade can finally come to a rest - I've finally found in Upstream, what I've been so desperate for over all these years  - great service, upscale ambiance, and fresh, quality seafood.",

    "text": "I'm really torn here between a 3 and a 4 star review. If not for my most recent visit to Upstream I'd have given 4 stars. I've only come for brunch though, if that's any disclaimer.  On that note, generally speaking the brunch is good stuff. Their buffet carries a wide selection of options from gourmet to staple southern eats. There are raw oysters and cocktail shrimp to mac and cheese to charcuterie to sushi to cuts of roast beef to cheesecakes and cobblers. There's really no rhyme or reason to it, not that it's a bad thing. I think people like the options. Of course have bloody marys and mimosas. They also pass you a menu of about six small dishes you can special order straight to your table. These include shrimp and grits, trout (my favorite!), a mini omelette, Belgian waffle and eggs benedict. I'm mostly disappointed in their choice to remove the shrimp and grits from the buffet and put it on the menu. I suppose it is still endless though.  I never can complain about the flavors of things here. I like most of what they serve but for a majority of it I wouldn't say that it's worth the hefty price of $25+ for all you can eat brunch. We all know we never get our money's worth at buffets anyways. The service is also a bit spotty so I would find it difficult to further justify that high cost. The experience in general isn't bad. The location and atmosphere in the restaurant is an attempt at fancy that clashes with the buffet style set up and some of the more basic food offerings.  Ultimately I'm not saying I wouldn't come back here but it wouldn't be anytime soon simply because of the price point. I'm going to be out searching for better quality at this price.",

    "text": "Got some time to kill? Great! Be prepared to sit in here no less than an hour. Every time we come here the service is incredibly slow regardless of how few people are sitting down to eat.  Today, for example, (August 5) I came in alone and sat at the empty bar and had 3 sushi rolls and it all took over an hour.   I stood in the entrance for a couple of minutes as the first couple in front of me was seated. The hostess came back to answer the phone, still not acknowledging me to tell me just a second or placing the call on hold. I ended up seating myself at the bar, assuming bar service here would be as attentive as literally anywhere else.   It sat at the bar for about 5 minutes without being acknowledged by the two people appearing to be working the bar. They would pop in the bar to make a drink and leave...they didn't stick around. After it was painfully obvious I was there and not leaving, then I was given some water and menus. About a minute later I was asked if I was ready to order. I was not I had just been given a menu I am not in the least familiar with. Nobody came back for over another 10 minutes. After someone finally came back around my order was taken and the sushi arrived quickly. Seems the only person being efficient in the bar area was the sushi chef. After I was finished with the 3 rolls (which doesn't take long for a person eating their first meal of the day at such an hour) I sat and waited for someone to to make an appearance for me to ask for the bill.   I arrived at 1:22pm and left at 2:31pm.  I didn't want to sit around. I was just grabbing some lunch at an uncrowded place before picking my husband up from Longview...but I was late .   I shop at Phillips Place regularly and that is the only reason I've kept giving Upstream a chance, because I'm there. I don't go because the food is just spectacular, it's ok at best. With better service, I could justify the cost as I do with many other places. Also, with better service, we all could have saved 30 minutes on this experience.   Seriously the biggest waste of time and worst $40 I've ever spent on 3 sushi rolls. I can guarantee it will never happen again.",

Great seafood spot with a fusion and Southern cooking twist that results in hearty meals, extensive drink choices, and catered ambiance.  Food is always creative and tasty but service seems to fluctuate between fantastic and inattentive pacing.

Plates are small portions (example: calamari came with two pieces and sushi roll was 4 pieces). I wouldn't have minded any of this if service wasnt so slow. The plates are only a few bites but it took 10-15 mins to get your next plate. It took us almost 2 hours to taste everything we wanted on the menu and we were still hungry. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed and appeared to be annoyed whenever we ordered another plate. We also got some very fishy tasting oysters that we spit out immediately. Eventually, we were tired of waiting and just asked for the check. Only reason this gets any stars is because the food was actually very good (exception of oysters). Maybe I would go back to try their regular meals but brunch isn't worth the time or money. TL;DR brunch is only \"unlimited\" if your willing to spend a few hours and don't mind a grumpy waiter, however food was good",

Also the tapas plates tend to be more breakfast oriented. We love the french toast, nice and gooey!  They also have a salad bar, sushi and a dessert station. The desserts have been different every time we have come. If you want to order a cocktail make your reservations closer to noon. If you want to avoid the crowd come when they are open. We tend to get there at 10:30 am right when they open and have the place to ourselves for a bit.  The staff is always exceptional from the hostess, to the servers, to the people restocking the food.

As a good food lover, I don't mind to pay more but I do care about well designed and well cooked healthy food. At Easter Sunday buffet, I saw big chunks of iceberg lettuce, devil egg, thick cut irregular shape raw country ham; quite a few side dishes thickened with flours and cream; and very oily asparagus. Spanish paella was so over cooked that the shell fishes were all completely dry.   The traditional Italian lasagna should be multi-layers with juice, tasty filling and cheesy topping. The lasagna I saw was baked in individually in 4\" -5\" shadow dishes with no more than two layers. Top was blacken and It was dry.  Upstream was famous for their fish cooking skills, their salmon use to be so tender and juicy. But yesterday's salmon was completely dry.   It was indeed a big change at Upstream.   The service was good and the waitress were very kind and helpful.",

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and classy, but not too stuffy that you can't laugh and enjoy yourself. Our waitress Corrine was attentive, but not overbearing, and personable. Even when her section got busier as the night when on, she grabbed a floor manager to visit our table if she couldn't to make sure we were not forgotten, and to accommodate us.  To start (we participated in the Queens Feast menu), we ordered the Thai Coconut Soup and Heirloom Tomato and Melon Salad. Both were delicious, but hands down, the soup was out of this world. For our entrees, we both ordered the Mahi Mahi with Sucotash. The fish was cooked to perfection, and whatever cream sauce that they put on top was so delicious, we asked for bread to make sure we got every last drop. And finally, my favorite part of the night: DESSERT! We both ordered the Bittersweet Chocolate Creme Brulee, and this was the most decadent and yummy dessert I've had in a long time dining out. Clean plates X3 for both of us. They also offered wine pairings for the Queens Feast menu at 3 glasses for $15, which is a steal (and they were pretty decent wines/pours at that). *I uploaded pics!*  Overall, the recommendation was right on point with our experience, if not better. The meal was well-paced and spaced, and at no point in time, did we feel rushed. We were greeted with smiles at the hostess stand, and every wait staff member was courteous and pleasant. Corrine was great, and the food was amazing. Upstream has definitely earned 2 more patrons. Cheers to a job well done!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Upstream for years and finally had the chance to enjoy the Sunday brunch buffet with family.  After being seated, our server breezed by to let us know he would be taking care of us and that he would be back to take our drink orders. We sat for nearly ten minutes before we were able to order drinks and be directed to the buffet.  It's critical to note here that Upstream was in no way busy at this time. I didn't see any other servers, so I'm left to believe that the gentleman taking care of us was the only employee on the floor.   Our drinks arrived well after our first trip to the buffet and only received sporadic refills. We had to flag him down more than once to ask for tapas from the supplemental brunch menu; once we each ordered something, he'd inaccurately relay the order back to us. We had to correct him each time.   From the time we arrived to the time we left nearly 90 minutes later, the buffet was never replenished. The spread appeared picked-over on our first trip and slowly deteriorated from there. The young man behind the carving station looked miserable at his post between the fruit fly speckled pineapple tray and the dried out sushi platter.   Near the end of our meal, brunch service began to wrap up. Employees swarmed the remnants of the buffet and weren't heard from again; when we left the place was like a ghost town.  If I were to try brunch again, I would go at the beginning of service so I knew I would get the full experience. There's a lot of room for improvement here.",

    "text": "Unhappily surprised. We had a party of 5 (two big birthday celebrations) and had been to Upstream many times over the years, but not recently. Sad to say, this time was not satisfying at all and the restaurant has changed.  The appetizer cart was cute, but he didn't make it all the way around the table so some people weren't offered anything. We had the lobster bisque (called Dim Sum Bisque), which was sweet (like coconut milk with sugar added) and had no lobster flavor.  The miso soup was tasty but had huge undercooked leaves in it that were impossible to eat with a spoon. We had the mussels which were good but then, a nice broth was leftover in the bowl and not a single piece of bread for dipping.  The raw oysters were TINY (like the size of my fingertip) and pretty flavorless. We had the Hamachi appetizer, which was nothing but a fried dorsal fin with the bone detached , and a tiny piece of meat. It was flavored exactly the same as the Saki Seabass entree. The other seabass entree was similar and they were about 4 oz. of fish.  (Everything has the same flavor --coconut, lemongrass, soy, Saki, so if you order one thing, you've tasted it all). My son had the crab risotto (which must have been crab broth risotto, because there was zero crab in it). He left hungry. My daughter liked her salmon, but again, flavored the same as everything else and a tiny portion that even a 13 year old finished in 5 minutes. The halibut was thin and boring.  The sides that came with our entree was a cold vinagrette salad of some sort. We realized they had placed the sushi menu on the table, after we ordered appetizers. Waiter never mentioned it. The wine was good and the service was good, except that he insisted we stay for the \"birthday treat\" (small donuts) and then tried to charge us $16.00 for it. Our meal was over $400 before tip and not one of us really liked our meal. We love good seafood and we love Asian food, but this was not creative in flavors, was too skimpy on portions and way overpriced. Upstream used to be awesome. Sadly, it's off our list now.",

    "text": "Exploring a different part of Charlotte outside of my beloved Uptown, I found myself in this cool little mini- town center and stepped into Upstream. My barber said they had \"bomb\" sushi so I needed to verify this, it was a strong statement.   1st, yes the sushi roll I had was amazing, full of fresh crab and ingredients, very flavorful and had the spicy kick I needed!  Must Try out: Sakura Roll - very filling. Warning: the presentation threw me off, looked like glop, I even looked over at the chef like \"hmm\" but I dived it and that was AMAZEBALLS! The topping WA blue crab, Sriracha sauce and some other yummiess.   2nd Must Try: sweet & sour calamari - they ate more like calamari steaks vs the thin joints we know and love. Very flavorful and great spin on calamari.   3rd, I was full after those 2 items.   Yes, it's a little pricey but guess what great sushi, nice atmosphere, totally nice for a date or friend get together and if you hit the bar b4 7pm there's 1/2 off food specials.   Bartender was pretty cool too.",

This was the first night we had left our newborn daughter at home with a sitter and the whole ride there I was thinking \"I hope this is worth it!\".... Oh my gosh! It was!!!! I ordered a pineapple mojito and promptly finished it due to the fact that it was absolutely delectable!!! (And had another, of course) the RW was wonderful and extremely varied. I ordered the crab cakes and WOW! Fantastic party of flavor on my palate! Oh! SO! Good! Next was the ahi tuna on this rice cake thing--- um.... Holy smokes! Amazing!!!!! The ponzu sauce just completed it!!!!! Bryan had the flounder which was prepared perfectly over incredible risotto...... Yummy choice as well! Dessert was ok although I should have ordered a third mojito. :) truly, this restaurant is definitely a place to enjoy apps and entrees. Go grab dessert at Pinkberry's afterwards.",

    "text": "As far as I can tell, Upstream is the best (nicest) restaurant in Charlotte, and I'm not sure it's close. Most people I've talked to tend to agree. It's just awesome: classy, hip, with great food and service. The one downside? It's super expensive, but it has every right to be, because it's outstanding. Of course, I say all this having gone there for a firm dinner, when everything was free to me. But whatever.   Great bar scene--big bar and cocktail tables for before and after your meal (or if you're there just to hang out). Super call outdoor lounge area for nice weather (definitely check this out if you're there during warmer months). Amazing dining room atmosphere--great art, great ambiance, great table stuff. Just the best.   And the food. Everything I tried was better than the rest. If you're really feeling zesty, go with their signature dish, their sea bass. It's awesome, although super expensive ($38). I gotta say, if you love fish, it's worth it. Indeed, if you're a seafood fan, this is your place. You might not love as much if you're not into seafood, although there are non-fish options should you desire them.   But if you're there, go with the fish. You will NOT be disappointed at all.   Amazing date place if you really want to impress. Or if you're just pretty loaded.",

They just renovated the bar area - I actually liked it before and I like the renovation - it's ...softer I guess - squishy couches vs. all of the hardwood - not sure which I prefer.  Anyways, we always sit at the bar vs. the dining room area, which feels a little too formal for my liking.  The bartenders are super friendly and have good suggestions and the food here is always spectacular, in my mind.  Their sweet and sour calamari is my favorite; the raw tuna tacos were very good, but it's a small portion if you're sharing - only 3 little ones; the Queen City roll was good but has too much rice for me.  Highly recommend the tuna tuna tuna.  The Saki marinated sea bass is expensive but well worth the price.  I could bathe in the broth it comes with.  The brunch is the best I've been too - even our kids love it.     We've started getting takeout here and I was really surprised at how good it was, given takeout usually is half as good as it is in the restaurant.  Big fan!",

The service was extremely slow, and portions were ridiculously small. The quality of the food was mediocre, except for the dessert, which was pretty good. In addition, the ambiance was too loud to be able to have a conversation across the table. Overall, I do not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning.",

We walked over to Upstream to check out the menu and immediately loved their options!  We headed straight for the bar where we were greeted immediately and requested two waters and two menus. About 5 minutes later we were still without waters or menus & our bartender was nowhere to be seen (there were only about 3 or 4 other people sitting at the bar)...so I had to go to the host stand to look for some.  We each ordered the lobster bisque and decided to share the sweet and sour calamari. The lobster bisque came out lukewarm which made it completely unappetizing and had one small piece of lobster in the middle that turned out to be rubbery when we went to eat it!!! We moved on to the calamari which was AMAZING and delicious!!!! Unfortunately, it was a pretty small serving for what we were paying so again we were disappointed but this time with the quantity. While dining our waters actually sat empty for pretty much the entire time the food was in front of us...very frustrating! We finally flagged down a server who was passing by to fill us up, which she did, BUT was not happy about it which she made very obvious with the annoyed long loud sigh she let out as she walked away.  Throughout our meal not a single person stopped to check and see if our food was good or if we wanted to order anything else. We were never spoken to after our order was taken and had to flag someone down to request our bill.  My boyfriend and I eat out ALL the time and usually spend somewhere between $100 - $400 for dinner each time we go out (which is at least once a week). This time we were in and out diners who were excited to test a new place for a potential new date spot...they failed completely! We can forgive soup being lukewarm or even overpaying here and there....BUT not being completely ignored like we had no place dining there because we were only ordering a few quick appetizers and water. Best of luck to other diners, we unfortunately must have come on a bad night...",

Let me tell you... it was one of the best things Ive eaten in my entire life, and hands down the best vegetable. I could have eating a bucket full of them.

We have had a lot of sushi at a lot of different places, but no where that we have been to can top Upstream.  One of our favorites is the surf and turf roll which has steak in it as well.  All of their rolls that we have tried are exceptional...we have never had a bad roll!  In fact, the sushi is so good, that we haven't tried anything else off of their menu.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars (and I would have given it a 4 1/2 if that had been an option!!) is that their wine menu is overpriced.  There is only one Zen by the glass and it is $11!!  The cheapest wine they have by the glass is $7.  So, I never get more than one glass of wine, but it is worth it to taste that yummy sushi!!",

    "text": "This past weekend my husband &  decided to give Upstream a try. We were not disappointed. We arrived early because we were unsure of parking and anticipated possible traffic issues. Traveling there led to an unanticipated road detour but we still arrived early. Parking was no issue. This was a new location for us and it was very nice, clean and well lit once t got dark. There is a movie theater there too so we figured this is a great spot for dining & taking in a movie. It was a little chilly but we noticed plenty of out door seating. We were seated for dinner shortly after arriving and we had a wonderful waiter (Greg). His opinion was spot on with the recommendations for everything from cocktails to entree. We started out with the Spicy Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Be prepared to create your own wrap-this was fun. My husband chose to eat the shrimp and pineapple/mango/Napa cabbage separately. The flavors were great. My husband had the Surf & Turf. He enjoyed every bit of his meal. His lobster was cooked perfectly and the claw meat was removed for easy eating. We eat out quite a bit with steaks being my husband's choice for his meal. He ranked his American Wagyu Flank Steak as 2nd best ever. His Surf & Turf had equality great accompaniments. I got the Sake Marinated Wild Sea Bass...MmmMmm Good. In looking at the meal I thought it would never fill me up. Oh boy was I wrong. This dinner  was delectable. Not a heavy meal but filling. I was able to have desert afterwards. Everything on the menu looked outstanding. I am not a sushi person so I would not try it but the reviews are good. Oh I didn't mention the cocktails. These were real drinks. It is so disappointing to get a cocktail that is supposed to have alcohol but gets watered down-this was not the case. I would love to return for their brunch because this would be more of a sampling of the chef's creations. The bill was not the highest we've ever spent but it was up there. I read some of the other reviews and I'd say that this place is upscale so be prepared to dine well & pay well.",

But the guys wanted fish so I went along for the ride.   First impression - I liked the outdoor seating area.. it looked like a fun place to grab apps and wine with friends, but that wasn't my fate on this particular night.   Instead, we were seated in a booth, in the back of the restaurant. Yay.  On to the food: We shared an assortment of sushi and sashimi off of the sushi menu. I'm a sushi snob so everything was pretty mediocre. But to my associates, apparently it was great considering they didn't say two words during this course.   On to our mains - as a west coaster, generally 4pm is not my dinnertime so I went light: the Gazpacho was slightly spicy, flavorful and the dollop of creme freche was the perfect topper. Unfortunately my second course, a melon salad with some sort of duck bacon didn't make the grade. Boring, blech, nothing impressive. The dishes my fellow diners ate looked good, but I really can't comment any further.   Even by LA standards, this meal seemed pretty pricey and not particularly outstanding.",

    "text": "To be fair, I generally stay as far away from swanky Southpark as possible except for an occasional trip to Earthfare. However restaurant week and the meat-eater's friend being a chef at Upstream led us to visit this week. We showed up around 7:30 during restaurant week, expecting a bit of a wait. The hostess was very pleasant and offered seating outside on the patio right away or suggested a drink in the bar while we waited. We chose the bar.   This seems to be more of an older 50+ crowd with a few exceptions. Mostly business casual attire but I didn't feel out of place in dressed up jeans. The decor is traditional Southpark - dark woods and colors.   The bartender greeted us promptly, presented the wine list and gave us a few minutes to decide. They have an extensive (and pricey) wine list and a handful of specialty cocktails and martinis. Drinks were served and that was the extent of our bartender interaction. He seemed to get in the weeds a bit with all the server orders coming in. Not a big issue as we didn't really need anything else but could be a problem if we were trying to order at the bar.    Our wait was as promised - approximately thirty minutes. The dining room is a bit smaller than I anticipated but nicely laid out. You have a glimpse at the open kitchen but not enough to gawk during your whole meal and enough privacy at the tables and booths that you don't hear your neighbors' conversations. Our server greeted us, got our new drink order and came back to discuss the special. I must admit, I enjoyed freaking him out by dropping the \"I'm a vegan\" on him. I doubt this is a normal request at Upstream and I wouldn't dream of showing up without advance warning (which we'd done via the friend).  He consulted with the kitchen and came back looking much more relaxed and surprised with how easy it would be to accommodate me. I had the Shaved Athena Melon salad sans ham, tomato risotto sans cheese and a lovely sorbet sampler with warmed peaches. The sorbet, while really good, isn't made in house. Meat-eater had the Smoked Cod Cake and Lobster cakes, Snake River Ranch Wagyu Flank Steak and French Macaroons. He's still talking about the cod and lobster cakes and how good they were.  I really enjoyed all my courses. The salad did need a little \"oomph\" to make up for the lack of salty ham but overall very happy with our meals.   I was impressed with the service. Our plates were removed quickly, our server was present in the dining room but not in the way, courses were served promptly and glasses kept full.   Upstream isn't my normal type of preferred dining or cuisine but I appreciate any place that has excellent service and chefs that know their food and are willing to make accommodations in a gracious manner for special diets.  I know Upstream is part of the Harper's Group but I thought it had enough personality to not be classified \"just another corporate place\".",

    "text": "I've been to Upstream three times, spanning a period of around five years.  The first meal we had there was excellent -- service and food were unquestionably outstanding.  Around a year later, we returned for another dinner and this time it was underwhelming.  The food was OK, but when you're spending $200+ for two people you expect an exceptional experience.  Around a month ago, on the advice of a friend, I went for Sunday brunch.  It wasn't the first time I had heard about the great brunch there, so I was anticipating something special.  We arrived around 12:30 and ordered a couple of mimosas.  What they served us was orange juice with a splash of champagne.  We began with a selection of small plates.  I was most excited about the crabcake benedict, but I needn't have been.  Aside from being ridiculously small (it was truly more of an amuse bouche) -- the dish was bereft of flavor.  French toast was similarly disappointing.  So off to the buffet.  We should have checked its condition before we sat down.  It looked like a war zone.  Mid range hotel chains do a much better job of maintaining their buffets better than Upstream.  What was once a smoked salmon fillet was now a ravaged pile of flesh.  There were bits of food and trash around almost every station.  They were out of most of the premium items:  the salmon, crab legs and crab claws and sushi (which I probably wouldn't have eaten from a buffet anyway, but nevertheless...)  I ended up with an omelet -- it seemed safe, although expensive at $25.  All in all a big disappointment.",

It is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days.

It has a bit of a modern feel to the place and you can feel a bit underdressed if you show up in some casual clothing for dinner but lunch is fine for it. I had the NC Trout which was very tasty whenever I would go there. The Lobster Bisque is awesome. The portions about right and prices on par for a place of this class.

    "text": "Upstream has a new menu, which was disappointing since I finally made it out there just to eat the grilled octopus and sea bass entree to find neither on the new menu. However everything we tried was phenomenal and our waitress was amazing and I can't wait to go back!   The new menu is cheaper and smaller portions than the old menu (think entrees in the 20s vs 30s) and has a variety of small plates. I had my first sample of Hamachi and fell in love! We also ordered \"the rock\" which is steak that you cook at your table on, you guessed it, a hot rock. The rock was a fun experience but the steak was difficult to pry off so I doubt we would order it again. The real star of the whole night was the sea bass appetizer that came steamed in a bag with an outstanding sauce. I couldn't begin to tell you what was in the sauce but I can say it took a bit of willpower not to lick the remainder up after the fish was finished.   My main was the steamed bronzini with baby bok choy. It was served with a ponzu sauce and the thinnest sliced scallion on top. I liked it but wasn't as wowed as I was with the appetizers. However it was steamed fish so there's a naturally built in excitement level. My fiance ordered the halibut that I was considering and it was served with some outstanding curried mashed potato. The curried mashed potato was a unique and creamy flavor that we will work to recreate immediately.   Our service was some of the best we've had in Charlotte. Our waitress knew the new menu confidentially and answered all our questions without looking at any notes. My wine glass never quite got to empty and neither did my water. She was around a bit in the beginning as we made choices but stayed away (other than refills) to let us enjoy the dinner. All of our dishes came out quickly and piping hot from the kitchen.",

    "text": "We tried this place randomly for lunch yesterday. I had heard that it was an excellent seafood place, but I have to admit, I was slightly disappointed.   Upon being seated, we were informed of the new lunch menu...well, it's an extremely restrictive menu. It's basically all sushi at this point, so if you don't like sushi, you're screwed. (I do love sushi, fortunately, but my wife was recovering from a sore throat and would have appreciated different options.)   My edamame was completely unsalted, and since this is one of those \"I know better than you do\" places, there wasn't salt on the table. I find it super annoying to have to ask for basic condiments like salt and pepper. It's a bit condescending.   I had the Snap, Crackle, and Pop roll, which was quite good. The unagi (eel) nigiri was decent. I've honestly had better unagi, though.   Service was great--our waiter was nice and attentive.   I'd like to try this place again for dinner, but if I'm looking for sushi in the CLT, there are spots I enjoy more.",

Profiler? Did we not meet your expectations as guest? Did we need a haircut? A Suit?  Andy I think helps supervise the local or something, not so much a fan. Why? Let me tell you.   - Jovanni and I out and about, going to the movies close by, but wanted to eat something nice. - I was outside looking at the menu.  - Jovanni enters to get a table. (Jovanni is Guatemalan/Mex, darker skin tone wearing a windbreaker like top) - Host asked him for a name and how many to get us queue, there was no one ahead of him. - ANDY, a mgr or sup, came from behind host and said reservations only to him. - Jovanni came out and said they did not have availability. - Out of frustration, I call (FROM OUTSIDE) to check availability for a table. - Host was cool/good energy on the phone and said we close at ten and have availability now.   Stumped!!! I know, I was too.   - I go in, have Jovanni wait outside. - Table is available, yes no wait.  - Go get Jovanni, Andy's eyes wide open. - We go to table.  Jovanni did not want to go back, I made him. He was so uncomfortable. I felt bad after for him. There was a few stares it felt like from Andy. Jovanni is still talking about it and is wondering how we got different response to availability.  Just creating awareness!!!!!",

    "text": "Enjoyed a very fine dining experience with my dear friend during restaurant week. Our waiter, Greg, was very hospitable and helped persuade appetizer decision from soup to salad. First, we had two kinds of warm bread with marinated olive oil.  My meal started with the Tega Hills salad which was both crisp (lettuce), sweet (pecans), and creamy (brie). Then I enjoyed the salmon with peanuts, arugula, and pureed parsnips. The surprisingly odd pairing peanuts and parsnips was unexpectedly delicious and creamy with sweet undertones. The salmon was crisy on the outside and tender on the inside! Lastly, I had the chocolate ganache with cherries and coconut gelato. I loved the gelato, but for me the ganache was too rich.  My friend chose the crab cake with pickled veggies and absolutely loved it. Next, she had filet mignon with mashed potatoes and shaved, grilled brussel sprouts. I tried the brussels and they were very tasty: flavorful exterior and creamy, melt in your mouth interior. Lastly, she had the apple pie crisp with caramel whisky gelato. I especially like the cinnamon flavor of the crisp, the gelato was a strong flavor but was a nice balance for the crisp which tasted more like cake than pie.  The ambience and decor was very nice. Upstream is a nice upscale restaurant great for date night, business dinner or family milestone celebrations. Restaurant Week with friends is a great way to try the restaurant without completely blowing your budget or breaking the bank. Our meal including tip was almost $90, however during a regular day it very well could have exceeded $150 as many entrees are easily $35 alone.",

The menu changed over with the new CPCC Charlotte chef Gene Cato a few months ago. The calamari appetizer used to be fantastic and now tastes like a fast food place. Lots of breading. Butter lettuce salad was so sad looking. The halibut I had was served with leeks I think but which were very tough.  True it's a Tuesday night so not much business but I feel like it's in a spiral. Would not recommend and don't plan to return any time soon. Even bonefish is better ... sorry Tom Sasser I enjoy your restaurants usually but not this time.",

We had 2 to order the salmon,  two ordered the filet and my bestie ordered the lobster. Lobster was a little over cooked per my bestie but everyone loved the crab croquettes. Calamari and the slaw that came with it was great. We participated in the restaurant week deal, wonderful Jennifer our waitress let 4 of us substitute our desserts for two appetizers. Most had the calamari and crab croquettes. Everything was great, love the location relaxed atmosphere and fast service. Reservations was at 6. Seated 3 of us a little early. Prompt service, no waiting, and complimentary valet no worries on parking.",

I  do not know how they seasoned it but it was spicy but so spicy that you lost the flavor; excellent. The have some of the best french fries but if you order a sandwhich skip the fries and get the brssel sprout side. it is great. I do not know what they do to the olive oil that is served with the bread but it is the best. It taste like you imagine a fresh olive might taste like picked off of the tree. While there i saw that they served weekday breakfast 7 - 10 AM so this morning I went back to try them out. At 8:45 AM this morning. doors open and after two loud \"hello\" and no one to be seen, I left and went to renaissance in small shops at South Park where I had the best French pastries in Charlotte.",

The servers were dressed in a white chef attire. \"90's attire as they call it\". You can see the whole kitchen and chefs cooking through glass panel. More upscale seafood restrains this; nice  and elegant. Had a big menu for restaurant week; great seafood for the price of $35. Included the appetizer, main course and dessert. We ordered the calamari and roasted oysters and were definitely great. Enjoyed the sake marinated sea bass a lot. The tuna was good too; served with book Choy and crispy rice! For dessert we had tiramisu with banana rum and Creme brulee! Definitely will be back for tiramisu. Our server was great with helping us decide what to get on the menu. She was very attentive even when it started to get reallllyyy busy. I loved our experience here and definitely will come back. Wouldn't have came here if it wasn't for restaurant week or special events because it's a bit pricey. But DEFINITELY worth the money.",

For $35, I had the sweet corn bisque, the 1lb lobster and the peach and blueberry crumble with ice cream. We also enjoyed the $15 wine pairing with each course. I cannot say enough about the soup and lobster. One pound was definitely enough with the salad and potatoes. The lobster was so luxurious that it felt like I was eating cake for dinner.

They were offering half off Lamarca prosecco making it $17 (a little overpriced for grocery store prosecco), but we still got it.  For Queens fest you got to pick an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert.  I got sweet and sour calamari and it was pretty good, it would have tasted a lot better if the breading was crispier, it was kind of mushy, but the flavoring was great and I have never had sweet and sour calamari before so it was a really cool concept.  Next I got my entree, I got the filet which came with a piece of grilled romaine.  This meal was pretty terrible. The filet tasted like Salisbury steak, it tasted like they just took the filet out of a can, I know they didn't but the flavor was terrible, the others at the table agreed who got the filet.  The piece of Romaine I hope was just for decoration because it was awful. (I have had a great grilled romaine Caesar salad in the past so this wasn't a new thing for me).  I got the chocolate indulgence for dessert and it was good, it was pretty rich, so a couple people who got it in our group couldn't finish it.  It had Oreo crust which I couldn't tell since it wasn't crispy like your typical Oreo crust desserts, but that wasn't a concern, it was still pretty good.  The food was decent here but the steak was a big let down, hopefully it's just because of restaurant week.",

The sauce was not sweet and more bitter than sour.  A dip or drizzle would have been a better choice.  The seabass broth was too salty. The server poured the entire serving into the bowl, so it was difficult to control the broth.  The seabass was very firm and the lobster dumplings less than spectacular.  Overall I was not impressed, especially considering the price.  I may have better luck with the sushi.",

    "text": "Upstream is conveniently located in Phillips Place. I went there on a late Sunday afternoon. I had a nice time and didn't break the bank.   They have great happy hour from 4-7pm each day (although you have to sit in the bar). Select sushi rolls and appetizers are half price and on Sunday they have half price glasses of wine. I think that they have a different drink special each day.  The service was very good and friendly! We sat for quite a while visiting, sipping on wine, and eating and we never felt rushed or that we were taking up too much space and time. The sushi was good (although I didn't care for their version of spicy tuna roll) and they had a nice happy hour variety. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It's a good place for a relaxing happy hour!",

Food Quality - I ordered 2 oysters. One from the East and One from the West. The one from the west coast wasn't that great =T. The one from the east was very sweet, as fresh seafood should be. I tried the bisque, which was pretty tasty. I also had the fish and chips, which was pretty nice. Crunchy, flaky batter, delicious fish. Very nice.",

They recently remodeled the bar area and it looks beautiful.  They even offer cooking classes! One of my favorites in Charlotte by far.",

I had a friend from NYC flying in for the holidays. We did a take out of 4 dozen blue point oysters for 3 people and it was worth the drive across town just to get them. Every single oysters were nicely packed on ice for the 40 minutes ride home. It was the most delicate and careful driving with the freshest oysters in the back seats. What a trip! We were so happy we finally made it home to try the best oysters available in town. The next time I would love to dine in and try your other seafood entrees.   The manager and the hostesses were very nice and friendly.",

I decided to sit at the bar and I have to say that the wait staff was so very pleasant and attentive. After my guest arrived we were given the open to sit at a table. The staff was very familiar with the wine selection and menu. I had the all natural chicken breast which was by far the best chicken breast I have ever had. The only small setback was that I'm a 30 years old energetic, fun loving female, and most of the patronages were 50+ and a bit snooty ( I say this do to the way some were addressing the wait staff...). Perhaps the time of day that I went played a role in the type of crowd I was amongst. However, I would go again, since the food was excellent.",

The food is definitely pretty good, with some odd menu items, but they really shocked me with how much flavor they had.  The ambiance of the place wasn't too much to my liking, with so many different plates, silverware options, etc...but I'm sure if you're used to this than it's no different than any pricey restaurant. Heck, the waiter even poured the wine for my girlfriend & had her try it before buying (which is apparently customary)...  It is in a nice area of Charlotte, close enough to the hustle & bustle but just far enough away. The food, while not top notch, is pretty good & it sure is a nice place to impress a date, but make sure you bring your credit card.",

Known for it's seafood and brunch, I've been here several times for dinner or some quick bites at the bar. For me, a solid 3 stars. I've never tried the brunch, but heard it's very good. Same ownership group as Zink & Mimosa Grill.  For dinner...I've had the tuna and the scallops. Both were good, and the portions were not too far off from their $25-$30 entree price. Both times I've been there for dinner, we've sat on the patio which is nice and a great view the end of Phillips place near the movie theater. There are some lounge chairs outside near the front as well, which seem a little off placed for me, but it's a nice tough. They have valet parking too.   I've been here more for a quick stop for sushi and oysters with a beer at the bar. There are a few TV's around, so fellas, if the lady(ies) are shopping, go here for a beer and some apps...you'll be able to catch the game in the bar area. Sushi was average to me, but the oysters were good and when I think Upstream, I think of a good oyster spot for me in the South Park area.   I've never had a problem with service and would recommend Upstream to try. For me, I need to still try the brunch!",

It really makes me feel like I have my own personal chef coming to the table.  The servers we have had are always professional & courteous & they & the kitchen are most gracious in altering to our tastes.  They even allowed me to order a favorite dinner entree that wasn't on the lunch menu.  I normally don't care for open kitchens, but even being seated at the nearest table to the kitchen it is unobstrusive!  I usually like booth seating, but really the center tables are the best ones & especially if you want to see and be seen.  The decor is very relaxing which I enjoy.  I also enjoy that the diners that come in for the most part seem to enjoy maintaining the intimate feel of the restaurant and are not overly loud (or don't feel the need to be since the noise level of the restaurant itself is fairly calm)",

A year later and this is by far the BEST seafood that we've found. We've been here 4 or 5 times in the past year. The seafood, sushi and steak (and the mussels) were all great. But we really really love the Costa Rican Chocolate dessert. It's excellent. The waitstaff is terrific. Very informative, attentive and friendly. It's a nice place for a date. It also has a really nice outdoor seating area to hang out and have a few drinks, appetizers or desserts. The only thing that I probably wish would change is the bar. It's quite spacious and seems to have a nice selection of beer and wine. I just didn't really enjoy the atmosphere of it. It seemed to be more appealing to an older crowd. But ironically they're in the middle of renovating the bar area quite a bit, so I might have to update this review again in a few months.   I would definitely recommend Upstream for a nice meal, just don't forget the dessert!",

We were sat at the table where everyone comes and goes from the kitchen while the restaurant was maybe 1/2 full - felt like worst seat in the house with just two of us having both our chairs bumped or kicked as staff flew by.   Cocktails were excellent - Old Fashioned and the watermelon margarita.  My girlfriend loved her seafood dishes. Even for restaurant week, she was given a heaping pile of mussels that she raved over. She also liked the salmon, but wasn't thrilled with being told that the temperature she should order left the salmon practically raw. I ordered the wagyu flank steak which also couldn't be ordered above mid-rare (tried twice to order it medium or medium rare). Even at the temp they suggested, the meat lacked any flavor. This was made up for by the onions and potatoes which were delicious.  Desserts were also incredible! Cheesecake and Cherry Crisp.  Overall, good restaurant week spot if you're into seafood. Don't go if you're not. Would have been really disappointed to have walked out of there with a $150+ tab.   Dining experience: 3.5/10 Drinks: 8/10 Food: 6/10",

The tasting menu changed since I first saw it, but a lot of the same things were on it still, just a few things that I wanted to try were gone. The price also increased to $30 per person.   We tried most of the menu which included: Sweet and Sour Calamari, Korean Fried Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Virginia Country Ham Bao Buns, Roasted Meatballs, Walnut Pumpkin Pancakes, Curried Deviled Eggs, Country Ham and Pimiento Cheese Biscuit, Pork Belly Benedict, Upstream Slider, and the Roast of the Day.  The best of the food was just ok, but some of it was really bad. The one thing I really liked were the Bao buns, but when we got a second order of them they were not cooked and my husband's tasted like bleach. My favorite thing was the coffee cake they gave you to start the meal.   You can order two plates each at a time. The tasting menu is all you can eat. The portions are small so you can try a lot.   The presentation was good, the service was good. The restaurant was almost empty.   As I said, I really wanted to love it, it just wasn't good. I can't recommend coming here.",

The other apps we had were ok-- crab cakes, kimchi cucumbers, and Korean fried lettuce wraps.  The Bibb salad was disappointing--no flavor.   The sirloin with leek and potato puree was good. I wish the scoop of puree was bigger!  The lemon mousse torte lacked the lemony brightness I was expecting but was plated nicely.   I had a bite of the chocolate rum cheesecake and liked it better than the lemon dessert.   There is free valet parking or a big parking lot sort of behind the restaurant.",

When we came in it was quiet and we didn't see anyone at the host stand. We waited around until finally the owner sat us. Our waiter was the bartender and he was really nice but they apparently had two big parties and he had to do that and bartend as well. I don't know if they were understaffed but the service was unfortunately slow and we felt very neglected. It wasn't his fault.  One of our rolls didn't state it had wasabi on it and we were told that the chef didn't usually do that. We didn't get to order much for waiting 2 hours for service and our food to come out. Our last roll also still had some Saran Wrap on it from when they rolled it.  The owner was pretty nice though and understanding when we told him about our experience and apologized.  I'm hoping to come back and give this place another try despite all the negative reviews on the service and wait and despite our experience. Because it was a nice restaurant and the food wasn't bad at all it was just not the right day.",

    "text": "I came here to visit a friend for the weekend. We wanted a brunch spot to eat at so we came here. It was completely dead due to the panthers game, so we were seated immediately in the dining room. The website was confusing about the time the brunch ended. We weren't sure if it was over at 2 or 3. I think on Saturdays it is over later than Sunday.   We came there when brunch was ending and they still let us take advantage of brunch. This is what made us drive to this particular restaurant. They had an unlimited brunch tasting menu for $26 with $3 mimosas. They had your typical brunch items and some interesting additions. It ranged from sushi to the roast of the day. The items are small like tapas and they let you order two things at a time.   Because the restaurant was empty we got our items pretty quickly. I ate most of the items on the menu except for the ones that had pork in them, and things I did not want to experiment with like quail eggs.   My favorite was:  avocado salmon toast- had a great mixture of avocado and salmon with a nice flavor.   kabocha pancake- was pretty sweet and flavorful. It is a Japanese style pancake and It reminded me of a sweet potato pancake.   Curried deviled eggs- looked like regular deviled egg but you can def taste the seasoning.   The mini burger- It was a nice size and flavor  Everything on the menu is worth trying and I challenge you to try the whole menu without getting full! The price is great as well even with two mimosas!",

When we walked in, the hostess was very unfriendly and had a bit of an attitude. We had a group of 11 (which we made the reservation on Opentable without any issue) and she acted like we were an inconvenience.   The food was average. Interesting crab croquets appetizer. It was my first time ever trying this dish so I have nothing to compare it to. The breading in the outside was good and the inside was almost soup.   The salmon was served with caviar on top (which I don't believe is mentioned on the menu). The piece I got was thin and unimpressive. No real flavor. Very average. It came with a small dollup of mashed cauliflower.   Our server forgot to serve me Brussels sprouts that I had ordered. It took about 8 minutes to get those out. I was shocked that she still charged me for her mistake.   Dessert was sooooo unimpressive. Chocolate cake was half a centimeter thick. Oreo was nonexistent.   Can't say I'll be back.",

For appetizers, you have many options to choose. We ordered mussels and crab croquette which they both have on their regular menu. The mussels in a coconut broth and lemon grass was good. The crab croquette with green curry puree is so great, melting in your mouth.   For the main dishes, we ordered wagyu ribeye and sake marinated sea bass(both $15 supplement charged). Wagyu steak was tender and juicy(of course it is wagyu beef! Regular price was $47)but the steak was so small for my standard. Main dishes don't come with any side dishes, just vegetables for garnishing. So it will be good to order side dishes(yes,supplement charges) if you don't want to feel hungry even after main course. The main dish portions are not that big.  The sea bass with lobster dumplings was amazing! The server told us that is has been steady seller for a while. Sea bass in shiso mirin broth was melting in the mouth. It was the best dish!   For dessert, coffee ice cream was rich with cinnamon taste. The profiterole with passion fruit mousse was okay. Expected more puffy and soft pastry but it was rather crispy on the top.  If I go back, it will be for the crab croquette and sea bass!",

    "text": "So I got lucky on my visit to Charlotte as it's Restaurant Week which is foodie heaven. From the abundance of restaurants presented my co-worker and I decided on Upstream, as neither of us had been and the options were great. Let's start with how robust the restaurant week menu is, too many great options but we have to make choices. I started with the mussels which were in a lemon garlic broth that was very flavorful with a portion size to match...I then had the yellow fin tuna and let's take a moment of silence for the butternut squash rice cake, first I've never heard of such wonderful goodness and second how do I recreate it. Think rice made into a patty and gently fried for a slight crunch, i'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it and the tuna was seasoned yumily with the edges being done just right...I finished with the apple crisp that's topped with frangelico oh wow is all I have - my entire meal from top to bottom was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely be back if in the area.   My coworker had the lettuce wraps, whole lobster and tiramisu and he stated it all was phenomenal- I can't have my food looking at me so personally I'm passing on the whole lobster but for restaurant week prices I see why it's a hit...oh if you opt for the tiramisu it's not traditional it's lady fingers that are soaked in some type of orange liqueur- I didn't personally care for the taste but I think my coworker licked the plate...thanks Charlotte for a great meal at a great price",

I was seated very quickly in a large window booth. I loved everything I consumed this evening! I ordered a specialty Prosecco drink...my own concoction and the bartender delivered!! I devoured my small plate of the Angry King Crab....y'all it was sooo good. The dish was Super rich and the presentation very cool the shell is smoked so that adds another layer of flavor. I ate two orders...smh... For my entree I had the Sake marinated wild Sea bass with Lobster dumplings and shiitakes in a Mirin broth...it was divine. It was light yet full of umami and everything balanced. Unfortunately there was no room left for dessert, I left here with a full belly and a smile on my face! I definitely will be returning.  Little extras... my only negative even though it was slow my waiter left me to my own devices a little too long, I wasn't in a rush but my meal was pretty spaced out. I couldn't be mad though he was so helpful. I dropped my diamond earring, and he literally took the booth apart for me to retrieve it! Now talk about service lol",

    "text": "I would've given them 4 stars but for a fine dining restaurant they overlooked a lot of details.   It was a snowy Saturday and we had a late reservation. Many had canceled due to the weather, so with a half-empty restaurant I expected superb service. We were seated at a booth with a rough first impression. There was debris in the seat, a big stain on the tablecloth and one of our water glasses was dirty. Then the waiter forgot the lemon I asked for and one of the other staff hit a member of our party's nice jacket onto the floor and didn't bother to apologize or pick it up.  If this were a diner, none of this would have phased me --- but we were about to drop $200 on a meal and expected a little more of a high caliber experience.  That being said, the food was delicious. We had the sweet and sour calamari and lobster mushroom bisque to start. Everyone raves about the sea bass so I got that, but I honestly liked my date's grouper dish better. It was a richly flavored dish with huge chunks of lobster in the mashed potatoes. We split a bottle of Malbec with the meal and had the blueberry napoleon for dessert.  All in all, I left happy with a full stomach... I just wish the ambiance had been as delightful as the food.",

The crab cakes and calamari were great but the mussels didn't seem to be cooked enough. We also tried some sushi, which was quite good.  Once our dinner came, everything went downhill. Our waiter disappeared for a good 20 minutes, no one came around to switch out our appetizer silverware for dinner ware, we ordered a second bottle of wine which arrived promptly but they did not change our wine glasses until we asked and had to pour the wine ourselves.  I ordered the Chilean sea bass and was not at all impressed. It seemed too overcooked and doused in the sauce it came with. Halfway through my meal, I had had enough and didn't even want to smell the fish anymore because it was making me sick to my stomach.  Overall, wasn't impressed by the food and our server (James T.) didn't seem to care about us since he was guaranteed a tip anyway. For a place that seems so classy, the experience surely was not. Didn't feel respected as a customer.",

I was really impressed on both occasions, but this review will mostly talk about lunch, because that will likely be more useful to people considering the restaurant.  That being said: wow, lunch was amazing.  I ordered the atlantic salmon bento box and was absolutely blown away.  I truly forgot that salmon could be so delicious.  Don't get me wrong: everything else in the box was delicious as well: the vegetables, the Asian slaw, and the cucumber salad were all top-notch (and I don't even usually like cucumbers!).  But that salmon... oh my goodness.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly; it melted like butter upon my tongue.  I'll return to Upstream for sure.  Oh, here's an added bonus: they're relatively pricey for dinner, but their lunch is pretty dang cheap!  My bento box was only $12.  That's pretty cool, huh?",

    "text": "Upstream, you confuse me.   My boss took me to Upstream when I flew into Charlotte for the job I'm at right now, so I have a soft spot for this restaurant.  At the time, and several times after that, Upstream was on my top 5 list.  Now, I'm not so sure I want to pay the money for their inconsistencies.   Here are my notes.   1. Bento Box is the way to go because the preparations are always different and feature a nice variety of creative, well executed dishes.  It comes in a wooden 4 square box.  Items like a jasmine rice with shitake mushrooms, lemongrass scented jasmine rice, or seared tuna with sesame seeds and an Asian slaw. Cucumber salad.  The only warning: when the bento is on the menu at night for dinner, there is no price.  ASK THE PRICE FIRST! Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure my bento one night was pushing $30 if not $40.   2. The salads are nicely composed.  During the fall, there's a yummy bibb and pear salad with dried cherries I adored, and this summer there is this mixed greens with toasted pistachios and blueberries and poppy seed dressing. I HIGHLY recommend getting either salad with the fried oysters.  But here is where consistency starts to slip. I've had salad here probably 5 or 6 times.  Half of those times, the fried oysters have been under fried, and the batter is a bit pale and the oysters feel limp and taste a bit batter-like.  Once the salad was DRENCHED with dressing, so I ask for it on the side.   3. The mussels are OK. They're not particularly plump.  (They're like the one's at George's Brasserie, not very memorable.)   4. Sushi.  I think sushi is best had at a Japanese restaurant, or where sushi is the star. That's all.  Not standout, and a bit too rice-y.   5. The dessert is downright terrible. I know dessert/pastry is a whole other animal, but honestly, if you have a nice a restaurant as Upstream, get a pastry chef to match. (*Totally agree with reviewer Stephanie in that they may not even HAVE a pastry chef.)   My friends and I had the trio of sorbets/gelato.  They were all icy in consistency and not smooth at all.  The blueberry tart (or I think it was a blueberry tart) featured a HARD crust/shell exterior.  It was bland, and I believe the dough must have been over kneaded.  We brought this to the attention of our server who looked dumbfounded, and answered \"Really?\".  Yes, really.  I'm willing to bet anyone who tries these desserts wouldn't like them.  As a result, these were taken off our bill.   In the end, I do think it's a nicely presented restaurant, with very good service for the most part.  If the food can be prepared the same way every time, and the desserts be brought up to a level that matches the upscale food, I'd be more inclined to bring back another 2 stars.  But unfortunately, instead of suggesting it as a place for my friends and I to have dinner, there are plenty of other restaurants we pick first.",

At the time, I was event planning, and one of the Harper's group gals invited some of my coworkers and I out for dinner/drinks one night after work to show off Upstream.  Everything I ate was PHENOMENAL.    The one thing I will remember always, and will definitely order the next time I go back was this amazing tuna appetizer.  It had a few different kinds in it from seared ahi, to some tuna rolls, but the most impressive part was the presentation.  I wish I knew about Yelp back then, because I would have taken a picture.  There were some tuna things around the sides of the dish, but in the middle was an upside down glass, with just straight up sushi tuna filling the bottom part of the glass.  Spicy tuna rolls on top of the glass.  It was magnificent.    I'm not shy when it comes to eating raw things, and this was HEAVENLY.  Fresh, bright, delicious, and presented in such a cool way.  It's really the only thing I remember, but it stuck out enough for me to want to write a review about it.  I will definitely be back... someday!",

We drove here from Greenville, SC where there is excellent food but Upstream has some of the best fish we've ever had. My husband had the noodle bowl with cod. It came beautifully served with Asian vegetables, soba noodles, and a perfectly cooked LARGE piece of cod...absolutely delicious. I had trade a bite of my lunch to get a bite of his and it was great, he teasingly \"swooned\" over his meal. I had the Chinese chicken salad which was large, full of lovely slices of moist, real chicken, not anything canned. Loads of fresh greens, baby asparagus, carrots, and crumbly noodles served in a light soy dressing.  Absolutely divine!  Now my Mum selected the fresh trout which came with her favorite, real mashed potatoes, and served with green beans. She lingered over her lunch, savored every bite, and scraped the plate clean. She said the trout \"was perfect\" and she was so full she skipped dessert. But not me!! My hubby and I shared a mixed berry cobbler served with vanilla bean ice-cream. Good thing I love him else I would not have shared that dessert!  Served warm, loads of blueberries and blackberries, crumbly topping...YUM!  Service was flawless yet never intrusive. This is a beautiful restaurant and deserves 5 stars. We will DEFINITELY be back!",

The sushi is some of the best in Charlotte and the they have a good wine list. The calamari is the BEST appetizer on the menu, but I do always have sea weed salad and some edamame to start..  a glass of conundrum there is over priced.. WAY marked up, but you can get a good Gewurtz that goes well with the spider roll just the same...  They also have great seafood dishes, nothing I have tried has been bad... all the seafood is super fresh..  they have added a great outdoor area for summer too..  just make sure you don't sit out there in bug season.. but it is a great relaxing area to have a glass of wine, people watch and share an appetizer...  Bento boxes are a great way to taste a few different things.  For dessert you must try the creme brulee...  and the french press coffee is out of this world..   alot of people love the hot molten chocolate cake.. little rich for me, but if you are a cocoa lover, go for it!",

It started with drinks in the bar, which has a full bar and can whip up some good cocktails.  Drinks lead to dinner - Upstream's appetizers are fantastic.  The calamari was great.  My entree was seared tuna, and I can tell you I have never had a better prepared piece of (cooked) tuna.  Great wine selection too.   Now, I have been to Upstream at least 4 other times.  I've had 3 great experiences and 2 so-so experiences.  Rather than rave about the other 2 great experiences, I'll touch on the 2 so-so experiences.   Sushi - I was in the mood for sushi, and since Upstream has such great fish, I thought it would be a great place to go.  I was disappointed.  While the fish was good, the rolls and how they were prepared was sloppy and generally, didn't really add anything to the experience.  It's expensive to boot!  If you're in the mood for sushi, you're better off going to other places in Charlotte that just serve sushi.   Restaurant week - While restaurant week is fun, I really feel the quality of food in most restaurant goes down.  Upstream was the same.  The meal was unforgettable, as literally, I don't remember what I got - all I remember was thinking about the tuna I had the first time I went....  tuna mmmmmmm.",

    "text": "I hadn't tried Upstream.. It always ends up lower than some other place on the Charlotte Restaurant Week list... lol  Luckily, a Yelp Drinks event finally got us in the door...  Their pineapple martini was the favorite for the evening, but the Upstream and the Tsunami martinis were just as delightful...  The wontons with pork belly were crispy on the outside with just enough tasty sauce and meat on the inside... The calamari had a nice, spicy kick... The spring rolls were flaky and adequately stuffed... The crabcakes were straight up crispy yumminess... I could have eaten a whole plate of them...    I know nothing of sushi (it's on my list of things to do this year) and the sushi chef at their bar took time to explain the different ingredients to me...  He didn't even make me feel like a dork because I was completely clueless... Sweet guy...   I am definitely swimming Upstream in the future... lol",

I forced myself to ignore the putrid fishiness that was underneath all of that sweetness, but that was a bad idea. I had explosive diarrhea immediately after finishing. Have fun cleaning that up in your single stall bathroom. Also, the apple crumb dessert was excessively sour and frankly just f***ing disgusting.  I wasn't planning on writing this review until I had another panicking man rush me while I was on the toilet because he ate some bad lobster.    Friendly service, but disgusting food.",

The hostess tried to figure out where I was until she was interrupted by management and was ignored. Management interrupting is a problem. Eventually, she found me on her own. As far as the food goes, I had crab cakes for an appetizer and salmon for my entree and my friend had the flank steak. Both average, nothing to write home and tell anyone about. The plus side was our waiter, Eric. He was extremely nice, patient, and accommodating. Disregarding the hostess, service was a 5. The food, while okay, was simply not impressive. For the price, I expected more.",

    "text": "This is a great restaurant for any occasion.  I went with my family, a party of 5, on the 4th of July.  I heard great things about this place from my brother and it met every expectation.  Here is what we ordered:  -Appetizer for 5 that including jumbo crab cakes, calamari, and mussels.  The calamari is the best calamari I've ever had.  It's not your traditional deep fried style but a light tempura batter that tastes like sweet and sour shrimp.  Our entire table wish we ordered more of it!   -Our meal choices were the steak, bass, royal platter, bento box, and the big tuna:           -The sushi bento box is by far the best deal.  Big portion for the cheapest price.           -The Seabass is by far the best tasting.  I believe it is their signature dish?  Melts in your mouth with miso broth.           -The Royal Platter is by far the most impressive display.  Has tons of seafood including shrimp, mussels, lobster.  The shrimp are massive and tasty.  Mussels are a little on the smaller end.  The lobster is the best lobster I've had (and I live in Seattle).  -They also have a great selection of local and import beer.  I was a little upset that they didn't have Hoegardeen but I decided to get to Nodoijto Beer (I think that's how it is spelled).  It's a very interesting beer with a mojito taste to it.  I also got a shot of limoncello in it which made it way too sweet.    You're going to spend money but its worth it.  Not one of those places that charges a bunch and gives you 1 shrimp.  Not the place to go if you're looking for bang for buck but perfect for a nice dinner with family/significant other.  Can't wait to go back!",

The food was nothing spectacular, especially for the price (which had an added supplement for many of their appetizers and entrees). Our wine glasses were covered in dust and had water droplets on them. They hadn't been cleaned properly. The wine specials that they had all tasted as if they were very low quality.  I had the Salmon, which tasted good, but again it was nothing special for the price. My friend had the Sea Bass, which is supposedly their specialty, but it came out way undercooked and they had to bring out another one.   Overall this place is overrated...maybe they just couldn't handle the volume from restaurant week.",

On our most recent visit, this last weekend, we were seated at a booth near the entry.  Despite its proximity to the hostess stand, the booth was very private and not loud at all.  Our waiter was helpful with suggestions from the menu.  I got the house mixed greens salad (not sure what it was called) which I enjoyed minus the beets.  The salmon entree was delicious although if I had read the menu more closely, I would have known that this comes with a little panzanella salad on the plate.  It was all still delicious.  The sauce that came with the salmon was amazing.  I must have been having a bad weekend for picking what to order though, because my mom got the tuna entree which I immediately wish I had gotten.  The sushi rice cake underneath the tuna with the sauce all worked so well together and I wanted to switch plates with her.  Now I know what to order next time :)  The prices are a little high here.  They had an incredible number of employees and I felt like I was dodging them on the way to the restroom.  The service wasn't lacking, so I guess this strategy is working for them.",

    "text": "Upstream was hands-down some of the best seafood I have ever had! And our server was great, he flawlessly waited on our party of seven's need with just the right balance of attentiveness and subtlety.  For our group, our server suggested two \"tower\" appetizers: (4) spicy shrimp lettuce wraps, sweet and sour fried calamari, and 3 crab cakes. We also ordered a variety of local beers and a dozen raw oysters (half east coast, half west coast). I don't care much for beer or oysters to judge (I suck), but the rest of the party raved about both. However, the \"tower\" appetizers were fantastic! Although the calamari wasn't my favorite, I LOVED the wraps, reminiscent of bang bang shrimp in perfect little iceberg lettuce boats and topped with a deliciously sweet-spicy fruit salsa (I ate two, everyone else only got one). The calamari was okay, but the crab cakes were wonderful - very little if any fillers, I just tasted pure, delicate crab with a light, barely-there crispy crust.  Our entrees varied. Most of the selections have an Asian fusion, which isn't bad but I might have liked to seen a little more flavor diversity. I was craving scallops and ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. The three  scallops were some of the plumpest, most succulent and perfectly cooked that I have ever had. However, at the risk of sounding like a complete country bumpkin, the rest of the dish was a complete and disappointing disaster that utterly failed the perfect scallops. Weird, twiggy rijad's mushrooms and way too many of them (TWO piles of those things, posed at opposite ends of the plate like mini pyres waiting to be lit). They were freaky, weird, dry and wholly unappetizing. I didn't like any of the sides or accoutrement (English peas, white asparagus, beet vinaigrette or fennel puree) - they seemed almost a tongue-in-cheek mockery of fancy foods...except the dish was meant to be taken in all seriousness. So, despite the fabulous scallops, so not worth the price.  The rest of the group loved their entrees, varying from huge and flavorful sushi rolls (I sampled a few and they were delicious; I wish I would have ordered sushi instead), to buttery, saucy whitefish dinners. We were too stuffed for dessert, but I and another guy had cappuccinos, which were delicious and speckled with freshly grated nutmeg.  The final bill was high (trust this country bumpkin when she says this place ain't cheap), but not unreasonable for most of what we ordered, and the service was impeccable. However, if I ever make it this way again to Charlotte, I would definitely get a sushi roll and an appetizer, which would make a very reasonable-priced and filling dinner.",

Order the ceviche which was pretty good and fresh, served with taro chips and such mixed in with diced up avocado and squid. But they charged me for the large size when specifically it has two price points for this dish and I asked for small, and they waiter noted that down. Later I was explained there is no big or small, just happy hour price and not happy hour. Why was this not noted on the menu? When is your happy hour? And why did the waiter not correct me when I said I wanted the small? Our waiter was pretty spacey, it took forever to flag him down to fill up our water and bring out our check, service was kind of a disaster, for a high end restaurant, you definitely expect better. My sushi was first brought to the wrong table and then brought out to me, wow, gotta get your logistics straight. The sushi was OK, order the spicy salmon roll. Nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "Pretty sub-par brunch and this place is definitely not headed in the right direction.  Came here for Sunday brunch with a coupla buddies.  Was disappointed at the brunch foods available and the service.  Food - nothing really stands out, which I guess I should expect considering it is a brunch buffet.  That being said, the bar should not be set so low for any restaurant, and they should not be aiming for the status quo.  .  What's up with the tapa-style fish taco? Didn't know you could put canned tuna in a shell and call it a day.  Or what about their grits?  It was more like dried-out mashed potato looking at the viscosity of it.  Would really like them to step up their food quality, even if it is buffet-style.  Been to plenty of really great brunch buffet places, like the Castaways brunch in Burbank, CA.    Service - Hostess was really awkward when we walked in and didn't immediately greet us or ask what we needed--maybe she was new.  The wait was beyond 30 minutes which is understandable.  The other hostess, who was bubblier, asked for our number bc we were going to wander around Phillips Place and told us that she would call when we could be seated.  We returned a little early and just sat outside waiting for a phone call.  She popped her head outside, \"Oh, didn't know you guys were going to just be waiting outside, you can come inside and I'll seat you.\"  The problem was that she was more surprised that we were there.  She should have DEFINITELY called us like she said she would.  To catch us on happenstance outside makes me think that we were not a priority, or that she was not going to call us.  Gotta follow up immediately when you extend extra service like that.  Dishes weren't cleared at a fast enough rate.  Seriously though, it's not like brunch is a new concept at Upstream.  I'm sure the service staff can identify plates that need to be cleared because guests are reloading.  Chaos as some plates were taken while others were left--looking at the plate clear selection, no rhyme or reason it seems.  Empty plates left, while some with left over food taken, etc.    Gave this place a second shot, but unimpressed.  dmo out",

First, the restaurant is rather large. This means there are servers and such fluttering about all the time, and you feel like you are running some sort of gauntlet just to go to the restroom.  I started with the black kale salad. It was excellent, and arguably the best part of the meal.  My next course was the wood oven roasted Maine lobster. It was cut down the middle for me, and the claws were also cracked for me. Being a land lubber from the land of 10,000 (freshwater) lakes, I don't have a ton of experience eating lobstah. Fortunately, I had a New Englander with me to show me the way. I understood that tail and claw meat was good, but I was unsure of what to eat in the middle. She told me that a real New Englander would eat the green stuff, which are eggs apparently. I tried them, but got a little too squeamish. I would have preferred to crack my own claws or at least get the claw-cracking utensil, as one of my claws couldn't be opened the rest of the way with my hands, but whatever. The lobster was okay. Now I know why they used to feed these giant bugs to prisoners.  Ended with the mixed berry crumble which was okay. Did not blow me out of the water.  Do you want to drop some cash and eat seafood? Do it here, I guess.",

    "text": "Table for two on a Saturday night. We hadn't been here in years, and we were happy to get a table with short notice. I had the lobster and heart of ribeye combo, and my wife had the NC grouper.  We had the mussels as a starter. Overall, everything was great. The mussels lacked a bit of flavor in the broth. They weren't bad, just not awesome. The grouper with cream corn side was fantastic, and my surf and turf was very nice as well. Desserts of berry cobbler, and bread pudding with chocolate and dried cherries were a great finish. Coffee for some reason is also awesome. My only hang up with the place is it is a bit pricey. They are proud of their food. However, we didn't go here looking for a bargain, and I'd gladly go again, but I would probably skip the mussels.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week, January 2014.  I loved the menu that they posted online.  Me, Sweetie and 2 friends booked a reservation.  I called up and making a reservation was a snap, no problem.   I have been to Upstream 2 times B.Y (Before Yelp), and thought it was just OK so it hasn't been on my radar.  I'm not a huge fan of crowds and Phillips Place is crowded. I was happy that they offered valet parking so I don't have to deal with parking.    The menu was a bit confusing to start since it was their full menu with various upcharges for certain items.  Deal is for $30.00 and you could choose an appetizer, entree and dessert.  The waitress was very nice and explained everything and was upfront about the upcharges.  So, for example if you wanted an appetizer of the crab cakes it was an additional $4.00.  I got it now.....\"It's a profit deal\" (Steve Martin, The Jerk).  I started with the Lobster Bisque which was served lukewarm, borderline cold.  It wasn't good.  The bowl that they served it in was hotter than the soup.  Me and my friend sent it back and it was returned just as lukewarm so we forged ahead.  It was just OK in my opinion, it didn't have any lobster in it and was creamy enough but I've had better.  Maybe they cheapened it for Restaurant week?  The Sake Marinated Sea Bass was on my radar from looking online at the menu and in a last minute decision I opted for the flounder.  I'm glad I did.  So, it was flounder, nicely grilled sitting on top of a black truffle risotto.  This was excellent.  The fish was nicely prepared and seasoned.  The risotto would have made Gordon Ramsey proud.  It was probably one of the best risottos I've had, flavorful not watery and the light sauce on top perfectly complimented the fish.  Sweetie opted for the Sea Bass for a $12.00 upcharge.  She didn't think it was all that great and it was drowned in marinade which was a bit gross.  It was flavorful, but frankly a good sea bass should be treated better IMO.  I got the cheesecake for dessert which frankly, wasn't all that great.  It was clumpy and served with some dry granola or something with some golden raisins.  It needed a sauce of some sort.  I decided to save the calories and bring it home for my daughter.....she'll eat anything.    All in all, it was worth it to go for the entree.  The goal of Restaurant Week IMO is to expose you inexpensively to places you don't generally go to.  I'm glad I went back and may try Upstream again soon to see if it's worth the trip.  It's been a round for a while and there's probably a good reason.",

Mains were tuna with incredible sesame ponzu sauce, scallops, salmon & sea bass. We all were thrilled with this delicious dinner & I thought the service was excellent. We decided on cocktails that included a lemon/ginger vodka mix & a blackberry Manhattan.  Fabulous drinks!",

    "text": "First let me say as a new parent it is extremely hard to go anywhere as a family let alone enjoy a nice meal so when I heard it was restaurant week I dug in my heels and was determined to enjoy a nice meal, even with a toddler in tow. I saw Upstream on the list of restaurants participating and the menu looked great so me, my husband and 15 month old drove 1 1/2 from Hickory for a fun family night.    From the beginning it was bad.  I was told only a few items on the menu was included in the $30 meal and everything else would include an up-charge (which was not on the website when I looked it up).  Ok fine, so I order the crab cakes for appetizer...they were completely bland and had NO salt, like none.  For my entree I ordered the lobster which was the grossest thing I've ever attempted to eat in my life. 75% of it was raw and still had it's guts oozing out.  My husband was in denial and thought it was sauce but when the waiter confirmed this he almost threw up.  So we sent it back and got the scallops instead but they too were completely raw...not even a little done.  Like they were in the pan for maybe 5 seconds and that's it.  The manager finally came over and told me that they generally under cook most of their seafood.  I've never heard of a restaurant doing this but they should at least let the customers know.  I would have told them I like my food dead not alive.  The only thing I had to look forward to was the apple crumble.  How can you mess that up, right?  While it wasn't completely bad, it tasted like one of those cheap diner desserts with lots of apple jelly and no dough.    Needless to say I won't be returning here and wouldn't recommend this place at all.  The only good thing was the service but I can't eat that.",

    "text": "Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  The brunch is a buffet, so bring your appetite.  There are different stations for custom eggs/omelets, meats, soup, desserts, seafood, cheese, fruits, etc.  Unfortunately the buffet area is in a small area, so it gets pretty cramped when you are getting your food. Waiting in line for food is something that makes me quite uncomfortable and medieval.  The tapas menu is probably the best thing about the brunch, as they will bring you small dishes of breakfast and seafood options.  In terms of quality, the prepared food, like the tapas and omelet station are quite good.  Aside from that, the mass prepared food is pretty average. The breads and dessert are below average, since they are both dry and flavorless. I think I would have been satisfied if the whole meal for two was less than $30, but sadly it was about double the price.  For the value, I do not think I would return for the brunch.",

All for $27.50. Which is a pretty great deal, given the prime rib and sides alone would have cost about that much most places.  Looking forward for trying Upstream for other meals. If the food is as good there as it was for brunch, it'll be great.",

For appetizers, we ordered a medley of starters to split between four of us including - crab cakes, calamari, octopus, and shrimp rolls.  Each app was amazing.  They were presented beautifully and everything was cooked to perfection.    For my entree, I ordered their tuna dish.  It was fantastic.  Everything about it was delicious - I literally cleared by entire plate!  For dessert, my husband and I split the creme brulee and that was spot on as well.  Can't wait to go back and try other items from their menu as everything looked/sounded good and everyone at the table enjoyed their meal thoroughly.",
