Entrees come with soup or salad, I always get soup and Ive had like 3 or 4 different soups and not a single one has disappointed. Ive had multiple entrees, all but one were very good, the one I didnt care for lacked flavor and I believe it was because they were busy and I let it slide. Only had a plain slice one time and that was probably the best you will find in the area, very solid pizza (I was born and raised in NY). Overall a great spot for a relatively inexpensive, relaxing night out with the old lady or the whole family. Solid italian food.",

I only come here because my \"special\" somebody (as in he is really special when it comes to his taste bud or the lack thereof) truly thinks this place has the best pizza. My dear yelper friends, read my lips, they do NOT have the best pizza.  Nothing here is memorable. To be fair, their food are edible and especially if you are hungry and you are stuck out that way (hence 2 stars)   Truth is their marinara sauce was tart. I had to work on it at the table in order for it to not taste like it came from a can. Meatballs were blend and a little tough. Pizza looked under-cooked.  Service was never great. I really think it is a waste of a restaurant because they obviously have a core support group in order for it to be still in business. So either all their regulars do not know what real and good Italian food taste like or... Sadly I can't think of another reason.",

Ambiance was poor - chair rails and walls all scuffed up, and the place could use some kind of ceiling divider to keep the bright white kitchen lights out of dining area.   But we were there for the food. The soup was pasta fagioli -  a cream base rather than tomato and it tasted more like a bean soup. It was good. Ordered the chicken special and a pizza to share.  Chicken dish had two chicken breasts covered with prosciutto and smokey mozarella, with pasta and sauce. A bit salty but the chicken and pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a huge serving - more than enough to share and take extras home. The pizza was cheese, sausage, onion and pepperoni. Again, good sauce and flavors, but it was quite greasy. Will definitely go back,but will probably ask for a table near the front windows.",

I most definitely wasn't smiling when I went it.   There's nothing complicated about what I ordered, so some people might discount that as easy to get right; however, I disagree. I've been to a lot of restaurants that can't get the simple stuff right and this one definitely did.  Creamy buffalo mozzarella fried to perfection without being greasy and homemade ranch that was satisfyingly thick enough to have the True lusciousness a good ranch dressing should. Then perfectly sliced, wonderfully fresh roma tomatoes layered with thick slices of buffalo mozz (no skimping here!) and obviously fresh herbs with a bit of olive oil served with a carafe of balsamic so you can drizzle till your heart's content.  Warm, crusty bread served with creamy butter that arrives at the table at room temperature for ready-to-spread goodness that's hard to beat.    The service was average (not exceptional, but not worthy of ridicule.) The food, on the other hand, was fresh, flavorful, and simply spectacular.",

New York style pizza and super fresh. I know it's strange but they have a great Philly cheese steak too. When my meat eating friends are in town we go for a large all meat pizza and that is also great. I can't speak on the other Italian dishes but the pizzas out of this world. Locally owned and operated you can't beat it.",

Having tried lots of pizza places recently I can say that Capriccio is very good, I would say their prices for a whole pizza are a bit high and that can be improved on but a solid choice. Another place that tastes like capriccios is Da Vinci's so I suggest trying them if needing any new pizza places.",

I loved the atmosphere and that place does a mean business! The line was out the door for pickup. I went with the Chicken Passion, which was delicious! Chicken and bowtie pasta with broccoli in mushrooms in a marinara sauce. The sauce was spot on and everything was seasoned to perfection. My husband had lasagna which he and I both thought was subpar. Definitely not bad or made poorly just the way they make their lasagna we didnt like. We prefer a thicker lasagna. This didn't have a ton of meat or sauce on it. I am definitely going again to try the pizza and I will update my review. Their pie looked amazing!",

We had soup and salad which was ok and each ordered their Stromboli ... It comes with mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni. My husband asked to hold the mushrooms. The sauce was poor quality canned marinara. The dough was still raw in the center through out the Stromboli. Mine, which had mushrooms, was 50% stuffed with cheap canned mushrooms.  We ate what we could from opening it and eating around the raw dough. When we brought it to the waiters attention he explained that all restaurants get the same complaint  The \"Owners\" never offered to come speak with us and made it clear that they could care less about the low quality and undercooked food. We paid 29.49 and tipped the waiter his appropriate 15% ( we normally tip at least 30%).... Don't waist your money!!!! There are plenty of really good restaurants that deserve and appreciate your business... This is not one!!!!If I could rate it zero stars, I would!!!",

They used to have the small added touch of cloth napkins that has now been reduced to paper napkins and less than satisfying service. During this particular dining experience, my boyfriend and I sat with empty glasses that were finally refilled as we were finishing our meal. We then sat for an inappropriate amount of time waiting to ask our waitress for a box and our check to which we were then asked to \"give her a second.\" From that point on, all charm and eye contact was no longer offered.   I think I'll settle for oven pizza at home next time, because it seems like this place has jumped the shark.",

It's a small authentic Italian restaurant with owners straight from Italy.  Their food is ALL very good!  I have tried a variety of items from pizza to pasta to salads to strombolis- and it never disappoints!    My favorites- their house balsamic dressing-  AMAZING- I have actually just ordered salads to go in order to have this dressing!  Their bread!  They bake it as you need it- it's doughy fresh and hot!  The butter melts on it and we always eat more than we should.  My husband gets grilled chicken salads and they are huge and delicious!  Especially the Caesar.  Everything is homemade here, and fresh!    We are lacking restaurants in Harrisburg!  If you in the mood for Italian and are on the fence try it- knocks Dino's and Hawthorne's out of the park food wise!  It's a bit more quaint- but service is good- or take to go.  Small beer and wine menu, and some amazing looking homemade tiramisu too!",

After a long wait, the second wasn't like I remembered. I only ate it because I was soo hungry.  The time before I had an amazing pizza and penne ala vodka.  Can't say I'd recommend it after my last experience!",

I grabbed Carpiccio to go on my way from UNCC home based off of the great reviews. I got a cheese pizza, and the gentlemen said it would be about 15 minutes, so I went next door to Harris Teeter to grab some things. When I came back, the pizza was hot and ready. It wasn't terribly expensive at around $12.  It was really good. Up there with the best in Charlotte. I think Capriccio sits at #2 behind Due Amici's and ahead of Brooklyn Pizza for the best, although the service at Capriccio is better than both of them. The pizza had a great cheese to sauce to bread ratio--nothing was overpowering. A lot of places like to overdo the cheese, but not here. The pizza wasn't terribly greasy, either which is always appreciated.  I'd stop by again and eat there to see how it is, but for now, great pizza, good service. I'd give it a shot for lunch if you're in the area!",

It should have been a creamy pink sauce and it was a clumpy white \"something\" on mushy overcooked pasta.   Let's say they gave me the wrong order and that still does not change the fact that it was sauce was dry  and tasteless.   It looked like leftover pasta that sat in the frig at least a couple of days.  I had to toss it.  Before today, I could not believe some of the negative reviews but I found out that it is hit or miss with this place.  I will probably still order pizza, but I will forgo the pasta.

The dine in experience was equally enjoyable. We were promptly seated and the service was exceptional throughout the evening. Soup was an Italian chicken noodle that came with complimentary bread. Both were excellent. Cheese ravioli and spaghetti with meat sauce did not disappoint but I would recommend the shrimp scampi. The even have a full kids menu for the little ones. My only suggestion would be to offer a beer on draft or two. You can't really go wrong with Capriccio.",

Once I had a cold and came in to pick up my order after a trip and one of the owners gave me a bowl of their homemade soup, it was excellent rich and bold broth with their oven made bread, like something you would get from your Grandma's home. This is one of my personal favorite's.",

In many ways a tad better.  This guy takes NO SHORT CUTS when he cooks.  All of the food is good.  I specifically love the veal and their pizza is very , very good.  The service is excellent.  The place is spotless.   SECRET-  If their is something on the menu that you do not see, or you want something made special, tell him and he will make it for you.  ie-  Broccholi Robb and sausage.  Madone, can he cook.",

    "text": "I haven't been in Charlotte very long...only two months and I must say it's truly culinary HELL! I didn't realize it was so hard to find any good food around here. I've eaten at the best of the best restaurants in most major U.S. cities so I know good food. With that said, this establishment is a really good place to nosh. The food is fresh and tastes a lot like real Italian food. While, I haven't tried their pizza, I do know that their calzones are delicious. They use 2 different types of cheeses and their dough is amazing. Fried cheese is also amazing! I've tried 3 pasta dishes and all were piping hot, fresh and delicious. Their pizza is next on my list as it's been REALLY difficult to find any really good pizza here. I found one place that has NY style pizza that's pretty good...Hawthorne's. I strongly disagree with any bad reviews this place has received. Maybe it's gotten better since their reviews, I don't know. I've always had good service here as well. For me to write  a positive review really means something. Also, keep in mind, everyone's taste buds are different but I don't think you will be disappointed!",

    "text": "First of all, let me say that this review is one star, because there is not an option to give it ZERO stars.  We do not dine in the restaurant because we do not enjoy the atmosphere. Therefore, we place orders for pick up. When I place the order, I have a 50/50 chance that the employee taking the order is rude. However, if ever place an order with one of the owners, they are ALWAYS rude...for that they get 100% consistency. One of the servers is always very nice and the younger cook who prepares the pizzas is as well.(I'll give credit where credit is due and they deserve it.)  Also, there are a couple of items on the menu that my husband and I do like alot. However, we NEVER get what we order when we actually pick up our order. After getting home with our order, I have called a to let them know of their mistake and the owner is even MORE rude than before. My intention is not to get a refund. I just want what I paid for, not what they gave me because they were too busy to listen. Among a number of rude responses, here are a few classics.... \"It is Friday. We are busy....the order is not always right\",..... \"Bring back the food and I will give you what you ordered\", after which I told him, \"I can not drive 10 miles back tonight, but I will come in tomorrow.\" He said, \"You have to bring the salad back with you tomorrow\" and another.....\"it's not my fault.\" NEVER did I receive an apology....even an insincere one. Nor, did I receive a \"we'll correct this for you.\" Yes, now I am being rude, but please know that I was NEVER anything less that polite to anyone in that restaurant. He is a business owner in a small town that needs support of his community. We need business owners that appreciate patrions and I have been a patrion for over 2 years with no appreciation. I want to support my local businesses, but will no longer support this one.  He does not appreciate my business and I will never place an order with him again.  He will fail eventually and when he does, I'll take back my damn salad the day his doors close. In the meantime, I will make sure my fellow citizens of Harrisburg will know of my experience of this rude, ungratefule man....and that he is has no interest in our community. In closing, a little note to Captain Rudeness.....When your business fails miserably because of your disregard to your customers, I will NOT say, \"It is not my fault.\" because I'll do all i can to make sure it is!",
