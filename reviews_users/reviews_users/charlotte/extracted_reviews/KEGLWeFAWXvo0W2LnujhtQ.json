Literally if you take one sip of your water there is an entire team of people walking around that will make sure your water glass never gets below completely full.  The food is quick and absolutely delicious.  I didn't try anything I didn't like.  And their menu goes on for days!  I had the coconut curry with tofu and I could literally eat it every day of the week.  Wow.  My fiance got the lemongrass chicken and it was beautiful.  Vietnamese desserts are my absolute favorite and Lang Van did not disappoint!!  They brought out a handful of \"cookies\" with the check.  ~the end to a perfect meal~  We brought our own wine and I don't even think they charged us a corkage fee.  Overall - love love love.  Cannot wait to go back.  The noms are strong with this one.",

But unlike alot of those same Vietnamese restaurants, the interior of this one (tables, floors, chairs, bathrooms) is immaculate. Also, the level and friendliness of service is higher here than most Vietnamese restaurants. I could not help but notice the number of people the hostess (owner?) knew and welcomed back. Repeat business is one of the best endorsements a restaurant can get.  In terms of the food, it was on par with other Vietnamese restaurants I have been to. We ordered the hot pot and a vermicelli bowl. Both solid dishes. Would go again.",

Such fresh ingredients and awesome staff makes this one if not my favorite place to dine out. It's best to get there early. I'm stuck on the special hot pot with extra tomato rice. I've tried quiet a few menu items but the hot pot is my favorite. If you don't know what to order just tell the waitress what you like and they will make sure you are pleased.",

The menu was a bit confusing - they have stir fried noodle dish under rice dish category. But the waitresses helped us find the dishes we wanted pretty quick. Id say the highlight of the dinner was the Jicama roll - it was not something I'd had in other Vietnamese restaurants but was absolutely delicious and reminded me of China since it has Chinese sausage in the rice paper wrap. The service was awesome and I enjoyed the little dessert and candy besides fortune cookie at the end of the meal. Will definitely come back with my Vietnamese friends to check its authenticity next time!",

    "text": "I've been here a several times and for the most part the food tastes good, but almost unfailingly, I get stomach cramps after eating here.  I keep trying to go back after I forget about the gastro problems. Most of the staff and Dan, the boss lady, are very friendly and I believe genuinely so, but some in a very fake and dishonest way.  In at least 2 of my visits including my last visit, the bill was added up incorrectly.  The first time, I thought it was just an honest mistake and let it slide.  The 2nd time, I confronted the short girl at the register and she lied straight to my face that the menu price was incorrect (which would be an illegal bait and switch tactic. Your advertised price even if incorrect is what you must charge), she made up some new price and asked me with a sly smile, \"would you like me to add it up again?\"  (as in, are you serious? do you want me to take the time to add up your bill again while I am so crazy super busy?) I didn't want to cause a scene as there were many people waiting in line to get in and they were very busy.  I said, \"no that's fine if you are sure it's correct\".  I still knew in the back of my mind that even with the made up price, the numbers still didn't add up.  The deception was intentional and even when confronted she didn't back down to correct the intended over charge.  Like I said, I've been many times and the food is good, but I will not continue to patronize a business with dishonest people trying to cheat you.  If you decide to go anyway, make sure you have your calculators out and add up the check from the menu prices before you order as the bill is presented in Vietnamese and you won't be able to read it or make any sense of it as it is not itemized with individual prices.  Hopefully, going forward, now that the secret is out, they will stop this age old practice of over charging.  This is not something new, it's been done for centuries especially in China.  It's something that is very hard to spot and often even if it is noticed after the fact, most people would just let it go and like me figure it was an honest mistake and say, oh it's just a few extra dollars.",

I know it's wrong to judge like that, but seriously, until the food is in front of you it's a scary place.  But the food.  OMG the food.  Fresh, light, perfectly seasoned and plentiful.  The service is amazing - in fact, I rarely order straight from the menu.  The wait staff seem to love offering to \"make for you special\" if you just tell them what you like.    I love veggies, and I've never had fresher, more perfectly cooked veggies in all of Charlotte.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and patient with those of us that aren't very familiar with vietnamese, and they do a wonderful job explaining things and offering alternatives.  If you haven't been, GO, but I would recommend going for lunch instead of dinner just to make sure it's daylight outside. ;-)  I love the pineapple fried rice (with no tofu and extra veggies), and my husband loves #90.

    "text": "Lang Van is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte, hands down.  The location itself is small and not in the most appealing location, but don't let that fool you. The front lot is super small, but there's more parking in the back. The seating is really tight, but I never feel cramped. The interior is simple and square, but spruced up with stitched maps of Vietnam on the tables and bamboo shoots around the perimeter.   The service here is incredible. It's always packed, but the staff make sure to recognize and greet you as soon as you enter. There's never that many employees it seems, but they are buzzing like bees around to make sure everything is perfect. The thing that blows my mind is that my glass of ice water is never empty. As soon as I take a sip, it seems someone is there to replenish. YES!  Appetizer-wise, make sure you try the TEMPLE ROLLS. These little guys are made in heaven. They are a simple clear rice paper roll filled with super crispy tofu, lettuce, mint, and bean sprouts. What makes them special is the PEANUT SAUCE. Dear lord I could consume buckets of this nectar.  The menu is huge and has almost any Vietnamese dish you can think of and it's SUPER VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY. There's so much I wanna try but I usually get one of these 4 dishes:  Bean Curd with Lemongrass (#69): big chunks of super crispy tofu, covered in lemon grass. On top of a bed of steamed vermicelli, green leaf lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, and cucumber. This all comes with a ramekin of light sweet and sour sauce to pour over top of everything.  Tofu with Garlic Sauce (#70): This is almost just like the bowl above, but the tofu is stir-fried instead, and instead of lemongrass and sweet and sour, there's a garlic sauce.  House Special Hot Pot: LOVE. This is definitely the most filling of my favorites. The top layer is fried tofu, broccoli, cauliflour, carrots, celery, and onion. Underneath is a rice cooked with a tomato sauce... it's thick and sticky and hearty and the perfect compliment to the veggies.  Pineapple Fried Rice: This dish is pretty simple. It's a basic fried rice with tofu, pineapple, onion, egg, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and celery. The kicker is that it's served in an actually pineapple half/bowl.... so cool!   Your check comes with a couple packaged candies (which I do NOT like) and a couple peanut butter cookie biscuits. These little peanut bundles are DELISH, do not pass them up. When I was here last week, the owner gave my boyfriend and I a whole jar of them as a new years gift. Surely, they weren't giving them out to everyone where they? Either way, this was so so kind and generous... I LOVE YOU LANG VAN.  Edit/Update: I was recently introduced to the Vietnamese Iced Coffee at Lang Van. Delicious! They bring it a tall skinny glass out which has chilled sweet condensed milk at the bottom. At the top is a small device like a mini Vietnamese French Press. The super strong coffee drips down into the chilled milk. When finished, you stir it up and pour over your second tall glass of ice.  I'm coming here more often for lunch to get my caffeine fix. Yet another reason I love you, LV.",

However, much to my surprises there was very little noodle or meat. The noodles were kid's portion. Come on now, whats a pho without noodles. Not really a pho in my opinion. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "I've had Vietnamese in DC and Los Angeles, and this was definitely the best I've experienced anywhere. The restaurant was recommended by New Yorkers who moved to Charlotte, and they claimed it was better than any they experienced in NYC. It was that good. Though the outside of the restaurant and the hoodlums running around the neighborhood are not too inviting, the inside of the restaurant and the furnishings were clean, attractive and comfortable. The presentation of the food is excellent. The service is outstanding -- friendly employees, attentive servers, and great recommendations. The wine list is not large, but it had sufficient options. The menu of entrees was extensive. I chose the Summer Rolls with peanut sauce, and they were refreshing and fresh. I am so happy that I chose the Vermicilli (#45) rather than the Pho -- the grilled meats and vegetables were delectable and fresh. I have no idea what the peanut butter cookies were that the server brought at the end of the meal, but they were the perfect and tasty ending to a perfect dinner. Kudos to this restaurant for being one of the nation's best Vietnamese restaurants right here in Charlotte.",

The make your own shrimp wraps here are a must.  I always get the seafood soup, they bring with it a platter of greens so you can put in everything to taste (including a whole bowl of sliced jalepeno!)  I am not sure what the seafood soup is called on the menu - i just describe it and they bring it out.  Fantastic spot!",

    "text": "We went to Lang Van on our first night in Charlotte.  It was decent, but not much more.  When Im trying a Vietnamese restaurant out of town, my first instinct is to scan the menu for a short list of exoticisms, barring those precious few cant misses, like the elusive Bun Bo Hue and Com Tam Bai Mo, I like to perform an apples to apples comparison, usually starting with the staples of Pho and Summer Rolls.  Neither of these were particularly noteworthy.  There was nothing wrong with either, they just were kind of bland.  I didnt sense any additional restaurant specific taste modifications to the Pho, which I love by the way.  It was just a decent straight down the middle bowl.  Same for the summer rolls.  I was torn between giving this place a 2 or a 3, its really a 2.5  If I was hungry and I happened to by driving right by it, I would not hesitate to pull in and grab a bowl of Pho, I just wouldn't drive across town for it.  If you're on the hunt for a destination Vietnamese meal, go to Ben Thanh.",

I have some weird dietary issues so I told our waitress (who is one of the owners, I think??) , pointed to something on the menu that was close to what I wanted, and asked if she could have it modified for me. She replied \"no problem, I bring for you!!\" and what she brought out was A-MAZ-ING. I was so happy with my meal.

    "text": "Good authentic food is hard to find in Charlotte. What I have found is that if its really good and authentic, not many people want to \"talk about it\". Why, because when the \"secret\" is out, the restaurant will get so busy, they will have a hard time getting a place at the table. Lang Van stands True to this theory and I completely understand why. The owner who literally greets every table at one point or another, is so warm and welcoming. I wasn't sure what to order other than the delicious Fresh Summer Rolls (highly recommend), she ordered for me. What was it, I have no idea but it too was delicious. The dish had chicken, broccoli, carrots and it was in a delicious sauce. She told me to have some of the peanut sauce on the side in case I wanted it. I had about three different people come to my table to either ask me if I was ok, if I needed anything or to put more water in my glass. Service was FAST but I never felt rushed, just attended to. I can't wait to go back but this time, order on my own.",

The roll was beautiful and so fresh, with shrimp, basil,, lettuce all wrapped in soft rice paper.  Two of us ordered steam baskets that came with a very flavorful, low fat sauce. My husband had chicken with ginger sauce stir fry. It was so fresh and cooked perfectly. They also let us bring in our own bottle of wine without question. The great service never stopped during the whole dinner. We will defining be back!",

You may have a hard time finding a parking spot, as I did the last time. But, there are so many patrons dining that one car is bound to leave soon after you get there so stick it out. If you do, you will receive a warm welcome and you will be shuttled to a table promptly, as long as one is available. There is not much room to wait for a table.  Once seated, check out the many offerings! They have roll your own summer rolls with rice paper wraps that you need to soften with the bowl of hot water. I opted for the ready rolled ones (2 to an order there so easier to eat as just one person).  The pineapple fried rice is a popular, and comforting dish, served in half a pineapple.  This week I opted for Tai Pho. Sweeter broth than I'm used to with pho but fresh accompaniments were delish; bean sprouts, jalapenos, cilantro, Thai basil and lemon. I've always gotten limes at other restaurants. I'd order it again. Lots of love and attention went into that broth.  I also love the peanut or almond cookie they give you at the end of the meal. I fight my friends for them.",

All the stories you hear about the owner being able to remember you and your favorite dish, all True. Some say there are other Vietnamese restaurants in town that are better , well I've tried a few of them and while one may do 1 item different or better on any given day, we are truly lucky to have as many good ones as we do. Lang Van is and will remain my favorite, followed closely by Vietnam Grille.   I mean, who could resist the service here, it really is that good. The owner and staff are always happy to see you , sure beats what I have seen at other places. Did I mention the food is really good as well. Over the years on 1 or 2 occasions I though the pho may have been a little salty, but that is a personal judgement, and it has happened so rarely it is hard to fault this great little restaurant. I hope they are here another 15 years from now.",

    "text": "I'd heard nothing but rave reviews of Lang Van, but I never been to check it out until this past Friday. My first impression of the restaurant is that it looks a little sketchy on the outside...kind of like a converted garage...and the parking lot is a big, concrete jungle. When you get through the doors, though, it gets much better inside. It's actually pleasant in a minimalist kind of way. The large windows that give it the garage-effect outside make it bright and pretty inside.   One of my favorite things about Vietnamese, Thai, and other islandy cuisines are the exotic drinks, and I'm not just talking about alcohol. I'm always a fan of bubble tea, fresh juices, milk teas, and anything else. I wanted to check out the menu at Lang Van a bit to see what they had, but the staff was a little over-eager to take my order. \"Can I help you? Are you ready?\" again and again, until finally I gave up trying to read. I ordered the fresh squeezed lemon juice, which is a kind of sweet and tangy lemonade. It reminded me a little of the lemonade you can get at Chic-Fil-A...good stuff.  I ordered the vermicelli with curry, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations. It juxtaposed spicy with sweet in the perfect way, and I ate it all. The tofu was crispy and spicy and lemon-grassy and awesome.  Another great part of Lang Van is the little peanut-butter cookie they bring out with the bill, and a little Vietnamese candy. I like freebies, and these were much more interesting than a fortune cookie or a mint.  Overall, the food was great, the service was (possibly a little too) prompt, and the environment was bright and nice. I'll definitely go back.",

Specials prices continue to climb, and at 15 bucks for a pile of soggy spaghetti-like noodles, a weird, sweet, shrimp-tasting sauce, and 6 pieces of tofu... well, it's just too much cash and sadness for a chef-boyardeed Viet classic. No sharp flavors. No texture. Just a limp pile of blech.  Banh Xeo - still delish - but smaller, less filling. Detached stuffings, so an already challenging to eat plate becomes annoying.  Corners are being cut here, to the detriment of flavor, but it won't impact their mainstay clientele - which love the obsessive-servitude, the \"you won't like that, try this\" attitude. The service has never been charming to me, and it's just not worth an arm in the face every 3 minutes if the food's not up to par. Which, for moi, it isn't any longer. Ah well. They'll be fine.",

Needless to say I will never go back there again I felt like a common criminal. Customer service is not your strong suit Lang Van. And to think I stopped going to my other Vietnamese place (Pho Hoa) because you guys were closer. I've learned my lesson.

Scared of Vietnamese? don't be.   I was inspired to write this review because I found a new menu item today that knocked my socks off. I always liked everything fine I had at Lang Van for the past several years, but nothing that was absolutely crave-worthy except the cool make-your-own-summer-rolls with shrimp and a pile of fresh herbs they grow themselves. At $17, it better be good. For some reason I really prefer it to Ben Thanh which to me feels dirty and a little greasy.  The steamer, hot pots and ginger stir frys are fine, but branch out a little more. The pancake is pretty good, but not up to the standards I was used to. But the piece de resistance? Lemongrass Curry Beef. When I tasted it, I felt like I had been waiting for it my whole life (well at least 18 years since the last love affair with lemongrass).  I had previously gotten #100 on the menu which is just plain lemongrass and it wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. The extra little curry in #136 gave it a kick and sweetness that was perfecto!! Can't wait to eat leftovers for dinner!  5/5 definitely.   The lovely peanut cookies at the end are fun too. It's a longtime family favorite, but now it's earned it's spot as a favorite.",

I could see if you come upon a place and have no idea what their hours are and the management seats you at their discretion, but to knowingly go for dine-in when someplace is going to close in fifteen minutes is just uncouth. Ever hear of take-out? Even bars stop serving food at a particular hour. I wonder if the person who gave it one star would do the same in whatever business they work in. Do offices stay open past five to accomodate rude clientle that show up two minutes before? They won't even pick up the phone past 4:30--so please--in all fairness, give a review that makes sense.",

Experiencing Lang Van is worth stepping out of your comfort zone.  Inside, Muzaked Celine Dion and her cohorts tinkle in the speakers of the small dining area. The water glasses never run even the tiniest bit low, thanks to the overeager staff. The cuisine is Vietnamese, and there are over 130 choices on the menu.  Curry, coconut cream, lemon grass, onion and sweet potato mixed with chili that provides just enough residual heat to warm your lips makes an amazing Chicken Curry dish. The Vermicelli House Special bowls and Pho (beef soups) are what bring many customers back, as well as the rice paper wrapped Spring and Summer Rolls. Fresh mint, cilantro, crumbled peanuts and julienned carrots garnish many dishes, and the peanut sauce is a welcome addition to main dishes as well as the aforementioned appetizers. Crisp and chewy textures juxtaposed with tangy, sweet and salty flavors is what makes these dishes memorable.  Unfamiliar with Vietnamese food? The servers will help you make a decision. If you return a few times, the owner will know your order down to the beverage preference. If you return consistently for ten years or so, she will extricate your children from their car seats, show them off around the restaurant as if they were her own, settle them at a table, and then remember everything your entire party has ever ordered. It is like your Vietnamese mama welcoming you home with all of your favorite foods, and then sending you home with peanut cookies and a full belly.

The staff is very eager to please, sometimes a little too eager...haha :).  As others have stated, the menu is huge but I've never gotten anything that wasn't pretty tasty.  The wraps appetizers are great, also the curry with the sweet potatoes in it is awesome.  I've also tried the hot pot where you cook your own meat (steak, chicken, shrimp, calamari) and veggies in the broth...very good and fun to share!  They have also recently worked on the parking lot and there's a lot of parking around back now.  Great little spot for some Vietnamese grub!",

    "text": "A co-worker and I went to lunch at Lang Van yesterday and really enjoyed the total experience. The service is exceptionally friendly and it seems to be a popular spot. The restaurant itself was clean and a bit nicer than I expected for that neighborhood. Our food was very quickly prepared so it also makes an ideal lunch spot .  I was disappointed to hear that they no longer serve banh mi's and  our server told us the menu was very old and insinuated it wasn't reliable, it made me question why they had menus at all.. perhaps it's time for an update.   We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp, and I loved the sauce but I'm actually curious to try the fried ones next time too, although these were very light and would make for a great summer dish.   I ended up going with the lemongrass curry dish as Lauryn recommended and it was quite good. Next time I will ask for that with veggies instead of the bed of lettuce. My friend just told the lady she like chicken and was up for anything and she had a nice chicken and veggie dish with noodles that was also really tasty. I will say it would be nice to know exactly what you're ordering so that you can get it again if you enjoy it. The average dish is about $11, which isn't the cheapest lunch but it is a lot of food and very fresh.   Overall I will definitely be back !",

I am slowly working my way through the menu, but it will take time because I keep going back for some items.  The salads are to die for, the curry fabulous, pho is well prepared, and I could go on for days.  I admit, the Vietnamese burrito with tofu will make any diehard carnivore reevaluate, and the hot pot is fantastic.  So try something fresh, tasty, and not your mother's ho hum run of the mill Chinese buffet. Go to Lang Van and see why every person I take there becomes a regular.",

Way out Eastway at Sugarceek in an old 7-11 but worth the drive and dont let the simplicity fool you.    First the Pho.  You can judge a good Vietnamese restaurant by the Pho, and this holds up well. Rich broth nicely done.    Roll your own spring rolls are entertaining and delicious (you can order pre rolled if you like).  I love the tofu version with sauteed lemon grass.   I recommend the yellow pancake also really tasty and you won't be sorry if you try it.   House special hot pot is a nice complement with a tomato based rice topped with veggies.   Chicken curry with vermicelli.   Bun.   Noodle dishes, fried rice.... I have never had anything bad here.    Iced coffee over condensed milk is like a milkshake - ummmmmm.   For the adventurous try some of the drinks like the Soursop Shake.    They get to know you if you go a couple times, but you are obviously not the only regular because they know lots of folks!",

A close second is the vegetable hotpot, and my children love (like squeal-out-loud love) the fried pineapple rice-- it arrives in a pineapple boat and it is delicious.  First off-- you do not come here for atmosphere.  They have gussied the place up a bit with some fake bamboo and updated posters on the walls.  The fact that you can see a run down laundromat and a car inspeciton station that may or may not be boarded up should not deter you from this spot.    Do come for the hot tea, the service, and the food.  It is outstanding.  Although, the rumor is the \"original\" Lang Van owners are now the owners of Ben Thanh (which might explain my love affair with that restaurant).  The staff is so helpful and knowledgable in assisting with food selections.  We have taken several people here for their first visit and our waitperson has always helped make selections that were enjoyed by our guests!  The food is plentiful.  You will not leave here hungry!  Flat noodles, hot pots and spring rolls are our favorites (and the aforementioned fried pineapple).  We also love the little cookies that come with the check... perfectly sweet but do have peanuts.  --This is a FUN place to bring a small group of people (6ish) to sit around a round table and share food.--  --This is a great restaurant for children to experience delicious and healthy food.  The servers dote on well-behaved children here.--",

I can go to a restaurant that charges three times as much, and invariably leave thinking that I would have received better service at Lang Van. As previous reviews on here state, they remember every dish you have ordered, and are genuinely happy to see you. Or they're just darn good actors. But so many other places don't bother to put out that kind of effort.  Sure, Pho Hoa has better pho, and nothing compares to the profuse amount of tendon that is in Vietnam Grilles tendon pho.  While I do wish they would give you lime instead of lemon, I don't really come here for the pho; but do order it when it's cold. Having said that this past visit the pho was much better than usual, with a roasted onion flavor that I really enjoyed. The soup arrived quickly and hit the spot.  The best dish they have is the lotus root salad; it is the perfect summer dish. Roasted pork and shrimp served on top of some kind of puffy rice cracker thing, with lots of crunchy lotus root. The rice cracker things are light and crispy; the perfect amount of food; you don't leave feeling like you have overdosed on carbs.  Here's to another 10 years!",

The summer rolls with boiled shrimp and peanut sauce is always a hit at Vietnamese places and this is no exception. The only issue I had was that they used iceberg instead of romance lettuce as the filler, which doesn't look at appetizing.  Overall, the entree was good. They gave plenty of food and for someone who wasn't as hungry as me, it'd likely serve as a meal plus a decent bit of leftovers. I couldn't really find much to complain about during my visit.  The best part of this restaurant has to be the table decorations though: a nice stitched map of Vietnam under the glass at most tables. This added a wonderfully personal touch to the decor of the place.",

I've told her so many times, \"I love fresh veggies and am in the mood for something spicy with lots of herbs, maybe some chicken...\" She'll listen for a second or two, grin and exclaim, \"I fix good for you!\" I've even been before and ordered something only to be told, \"No. You don't want that. You want #XYZ instead.\" Without fail, she's ALWAYS right. I don't know how she does it, but her recommendation is always exactly what I'm craving and hits the spot every time.

    "text": "How is it possible that, with my obsession with Vietnamese food, I did not know about this gem hidden less than 2 miles from my house?! Thank you, Yelp, for righting this wrong.   We went to this place on a random Sunday afternoon when our meal timing was off so we were totally starving, and we were not disappointed.   From the second we walked in, we knew we were in a good place. The restaurant smelled amazing and it was very nicely lit (lots of sunshine) and we were immediately approached by a smiling woman who seated us in a comfy booth.  We had the jicama rolls and the summer rolls as starters (both delicious) and I had a mix of beef, chicken and shrimp stir fried with vegetables and rice virmicelli. It was delicious and I topped it with some of their chili sauce to add a little extra heat. (The dish was delicious and flavorful by itself, but I felt like making it spicy anyway.) :)  I can't wait to go back to explore more on their menu. On the to do list to try are definitely some of the curry dishes, the hot pot, and the pho (to name a few!)   Just writing this made me hungry for their food again...",

The menu is overwhelming at first. If you aren't sure of what to pick, the owner will most definitely help you pick out something. Most likely she will just say she has something for you -- and it will be delicious.   We started out with spring rolls. The tofu was still hot and the peanut sauce is delicious. For my meal, I had the lemon grass curry chicken medium heat. The spice level was perfect, the chicken was super moist and tender. It's served over lettuce, which is different but I enjoyed it because it seemed lighter and allowed me to eat my entire plate! My sister got the tofu hot pot and liked it. My mom got the country soup (which apparently she always gets and didn't even have to order).  When we got our check, we were treated with an array of delicious desserts. On top of that, they sent us home with a bottle of wine and a jar of the peanut cookies!! So sweet and thoughtful. We love this restaurant, can't wait to come back soon.",

I usually don't complain unless it is really ridiculous and as you can see in our other post, we know what a real combination plate looks like. this place is only good for vegetarians and don't come for dinner because you are paying a higher price for lunch portions.",

That being said, the staff makes a True connection with customers.   Last time we were in, the owner greeted me with a hug and ask where my mom was. The last time we had been in (months ago!), we brought my mom with us.  How could she have remembered that??  With the hundreds of customers, I'm always impressed with the staff remembers our last order, or a favorite drink.  Top notch!  Food is fresh and flavorful. We like to do the build-you-own spring rolls, but have enjoyed the crispy yellow pancakes, and the shrimp and pork spring rolls. Pho is great, but so is literally everything else on the menu. Branch out - try to chicken lemongrass or a vermicelli dish!   Will continue to recommend Lang Van as a great spot!",

The manager told my friend and I to vacant the table in a rude tone. She told us we were just talking and we needed to leave to make space for other customers.  We had finished our meal and indeed were just sitting and talking. It was several other people that were still sitting at their table and just talking also, and had finished their meals before us.

It was hard to determine when they were ready for me, because they continued cleaning until 5 minutes after opening time. I finally went in when another customer pulled in and got out of his car.  On the positive side:  I decided to try the crispy quail, a new one for me. 4 little quail (quails?) fried to a crisp and dipped in a little container with pepper and lemon juice. Absolutely delightful. Very finger-foodish, so needed the napkin frequently.   Their service is attentive and quick. I did feel rushed, as other reviewers have mentioned. Good place for a fast business lunch, but not a place to contemplate one's existence in peaceful reverie, you know?  Daughter wanted noodle bowl (we got the mixed one--shrimp, pork, egg roll). The sauce complemented the plenteous noodles and salad, and the meat was tender and flavorful. The shrimp came on a skewer.  Thumbs up.  I wanted to give their pho another try, at least the broth, so I tried to order just a tiny bowl of broth--no meat, noodles, etc.  They brought a regular size bowl with pho broth AND noodles, and charged 5.95 for it.   Apparently  the reason I couldn't remember their pho for my last review is that it's not worth mentioning, in my opinion. The flavor is either non-existent or it's kind of like those high-pitched dog whistles that only dogs can hear. I couldn't hear it.   So, a mixed bag. Go for something besides the pho and you'll be happy.",

They cater to to an American clientele and speak English well.    -You can trust a four-star review of a Vietnamese restaurant from someone whose gets regular cravings for un-sexy foods like grilled hamburgers and homemade onion rings.",

Whenever I take a newbie to a Vietnamese restaurant I always recommend the Com Suon Noung ( Grilled Pork Chop over broken rice).  My friends weren't adventurous for it so they ordered something else.  I went ahead and got the pork chop.  It was so disappointing.  It was more like a flatten medallion pork.  I couldn't take the lemongrass, shallots, or anything else for that matter.  My friend ordered the fried rice, didn't finish it and didn't want to take the leftovers home with her either.    I gave the restaurant a second chance the following night.  Pretty much the same.  Nem Nuong (meatball) had too much 5 spice seasoning.  The Canh Chua had whole pieces of okra which is a no-no for me.",

I haven't lived in Charlotte for 10 years and have stopped at Lang Van only a couple of times since leaving.  I did frequent the place when I lived in Charlotte.  I remember EVERYTHING being great and the experience was always awesome.  I would even use it as a place to meet a lunch date with overwhelmingly successful results.  Because I haven't been to Lang Van in so long, my review is lacking in the vast amounts of information your senses process when stepping into  this restaurant.  You should read Catherine W.'s review from 2/17/2009 for a very complete and accurate account of what experiencing Lang Van is all about.",

I tend to go for their vermicelli noodle bowls, because recent experiences with the pho have been kind of mild and watery.  And this last time, the noodles were overly wet, the sauce was sweet and not very complex, and the veggies were a little limp.  If I had to pick a favorite Vietnamese place now it would not be this one.  The ridiculously aggressive service (really?  we just sat down, can we have a minute?  and you do not need to fill a water glass every time the customer takes a sip!) does not help with the experience.  The new parking lot, however, is swanky.",

My boyfriend is a regular at Lang Van & knew I would be comfortable there. He was right! While Lang Vang is not in the most prominent area of Charlotte, it is a popular spot. It's small, but very intimate. The decor is warm & cozy...the bamboo \"fence\" at the entrance is nice!  I LOVE fresh spring rolls & Lang Van's are amazing!  The accompanied peanut sauce wasn't what I am used to, but it had a mild kick to it & worked well with the rolls. They rolls are a decent size, too, full of ingredients & rolled up tight.   Sweet tea...WOW! It was just the right amount of sweet. I think we both had like 4 glasses each.    The Pho...we had the #37  - which features the well cooked steak. In under 5 minutes our plate of basil, mint, lemon, bean sprouts, & jalapenos & large bowls of glorious Pho were on our table.  I immediately fell in love with this soup.  I'm already looking forward to eating it again.  Restaurant was clean & catchy music played overhead, but wasn't overpowering.  The owner was so nice & friendly. Waiters & waitresses were fast & efficient, clearing off tables quickly & constantly filling up drinks.  As Chad mentioned, they don't have much for parking, so be mindful of that.  I'm especially pleased at ow fast we got in & out, as I was on a time crunch trying to get to a yelp event. :)  I was impressed with the peanut cookies & candy on a cute little dish on our \"bill plate\" (for lack of a better title!) AND fortune cookies!   Funny that Nick said the staff knows what he wants when he comes in! It was the same for my boyfriend & we have friends that say the same experience.  How's that for customer service?!  I'm really pleased with Lang Van...I'll definitely be back. Yay for my first Pho experience!",

As soon as I walked in, a line had formed that almost reached the door. The attentive and highly efficient wait-staff had us seated in 8 minutes, which was shorter than I had thought.   Now, about the food. We started off with the shrimp and tofu summer rolls. The taste was fresh and paired well with the sweet peanut sauce on the side. I ordered the Bun (noodle dish with grilled shrimp, barbecue pork, spring roll, and shredded lettuce, carrots, and a vinegar/fish sauce). I added a little sriracha for a little kick. The dish was light, yet very flavorful (almost like eating a salad). The bbq pork was very tasty on its own. My date ordered the pho, which was ok (according to her).   Overall, great value for the food as the portion sizes were fairly large. Just a suggestion though, make a reservation before hand as this place can get quite busy...",

It was really busy during lunch time, and the tables were turning over rapidly.  Despite crowd, we were greeted immediately after walking through the door and seated pretty quickly.  Hubby and brother split the spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were nice enough to cut the 2 rolls into 4 pieces for the table, but my mom and I decided to wait for our dishes.  Our server didn't even need to write down our orders.  Hubby and I started with the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.  The ratio of milk to coffee was a little too much.  I guess I could have not mixed the entire thing together.  I had the vermicelli noodles with the shrimp on sugar cane and imperial rolls (fried pork rolls) which was delicious.  The portion was just right and I devoured the entire thing.  Mom had a different noodle dish which had all the sauce already mixed, which was a little surprising.  It was almost more an Americanized version of beef and broccoli.  Looking around, it was definitely a place that catered to non-Asian customers..it had to be being in the heart of Charlotte!  Both Hubby and brother had different versions of the beef pho.  The broth was flavorful.  The meal was a nice, healthier way to end our week long holiday vacation.",

Our waitress answered the many questions that everyone had with ease and offered great suggestions. The owner was working hard helping her servers clear tables as well as checking on the guests. We were a group of 10 and all of our food came out hot and fast. Now the menu, at first sight was pretty overwhelming especially for someone that's not too familiar with Vietnamese food because there's soooo many options but since I was with a group that eats it often plus our server, I was in good hands. I went for the fresh summer rolls with the special peanut sauce as a starter and they were so fresh & flavorful. For my entree I ordered #37 which was Hu Tieu Dax Biet (crab, shrimp, roast pork, baby rib in a rice noodle soup) & the bowl was about dry when I finished! With this winter fastly approaching, I will be ordering this flavorful warm delicious dish a few more times on them cold evenings! Can't wait to try some other things on the menu as well!",

We always order the wraps that you have to dip into the bowl before you can roll them up; consistently and never seizing to be delicious. From there my father will usually order a variety of four different entrees equally as mind blowing as the appetizer. By this time I'm usually still hungry and split between five adults, we usually all can still pick at something. In pops our host with impeccable timing will help us with our order or basically order something for us that never disappoints. I cannot express or rave enough about this place.",

My go to lunch is an order of summer rolls and an order of jicama tofu rolls - 4 rolls for about $8. Fresh and light lunch for under $10, score! Service is always on point and you can expect consistency in terms of freshness and quality.

What I love about Lang Van: + Great service, all the servers genuinely love working there and are happy to serve you + Authentic Vietnamese food  + Huge menu with a variety of options. It's not just the usual Pho, there are a ton of other things to choose from (including more than 10 vegetarian options) + Food tastes amazing  + Good prices, you can get an entree and beer and share appetizers and pay ~$20 per persn + Cheap Asian beer :) I think it's $3.75 for Singaporean beer + Busy but usually an empty table available for you or a very short wait + Servers give great food recommendations based on your preferences (e.g. spicy..... noodles..... )  Highly recommend this to everyone, you won't leave disappointed!",

    "text": "How in the ever-loving, joyous world of immeasurably delectable Vietnamese cuisine have I not reviewed Lang Van until this day?!?! Upon my visit last night, I was astonished at my lack of review. Well, as they say, better late than never.  I've been a patron of Lang Van for years and have never had an experience where the food, service, and company have not been unique, memorable and utterly satisfying. The owner(?) or manager is one of the friendliest people in all of the Queen City. Regardless if you visited this week, late 2012, or even 5 years ago, she'll remember your face. She'll come up to you and give you a hug, welcome you, ask how your family is, and then hastily launch into bringing you a menagerie of Vietnamese foodstuffs.   The menu, which is not for the faint of heart, houses an abundance of options. I used to order anything with coconut curry or just the simple Pho, but the owner (I really need to remember her name!) simply asks me what I'm in the mood for, proceeds to list options -- \"What do you like? What do you want? Do you like crispy tofu? Do you like noodles? Coconut Curry? Vegetables? Meat or no meat?.....Ok, I'll bring you something nice.\" --------- THAT is why Lang Van is an incredible experience every single time. Not even seeing a menu anymore is a dream come True.   Recently, I was introduced to Vietnamese coffee. Check out my photo or some of the others. It's an experience to be had. Condensed milk, a small urn of drip coffee...strong coffee above a tall glass with ice. Truly amazing.   Lang Van is a staple in Charlotte's Vietnamese dining scene...nay. Overall. If you're even close to the line of wanting to try Vietnamese cuisine, start here.",

I happened to be in the area to visit a job site and even though we had already ate lunch we decided to stop in and get their awesome spring rolls.  When we arrived there was a wait. Lots of families were there for Mother's day. I never knew that Vietnamese food was so popular with families...rightfully so but who knew. I had never went to a Vietnamese restaurant with my parents. Shame on you mom and dad... Well back to the review, so since we had already ate and did not feel like waiting we decided to leave. We walked around the building to go to the back parking lot and the manager ran out yelling for us to stop and said she would get us a table in a few minutes. I found that to be an amazing gesture and showed that she cared about her customer's. Because of that we decided to go back in. Sure enough we were seated in five minutes. We ordered our spring rolls and could not resist ordering a bowl of Pho. They were both amazing. One of my best restaurant experiences of all time!",

It was seasoned well and the leafy side was a nice touch I wasn't expecting.  The mint, cilantro and lettuce wraps made it very healthy, guilt-free and satisfying.  I'll definitely be going back.",

Can't remember the name or number but I can remember how it tasted...THE BOMB! It had asparagus, snow peas, onions and zucchini. I added shrimp. I ate it all!!! If I could re-create that sauce at home, I'd be set for life lol. My lunch guest had the sauteed spinach special. It was sauteed spinach and a skewer of shrimp. Didn't seem like much for $14, but she enjoyed it :) Can't wait to get back. So far it's no.1 on my Vietnamese list!",

I am excited to keep trying more options as I continue to live here in Charlotte. I will take my mom next month when she visits so I will update my review then. She is going to love it. Everyone else that has came with me enjoys it. Lang Van makes me happy to live in Charlotte.",

The first time I tried to order the banh xeo they tried to discourage me, even after I told them I've consumed it many times before, and when it arrived I knew why - slightly sub-par. Of course it was still delicious, but not the best in town. (lots and lots of pancakeness... not a lot of filling.) The second was the rice crepes (banh cuon), again with them asking if I was really sure, and then upon receiving the dish again feeling like I ordered something they really hate to make.   As far as everything else goes - I love it. Flavorful meats, good buns and phos, nice curries, anything they recommend is fantastic, and the service is great (even better if you have a baby at the table) - I just wish I wasn't slightly limited.   Overall: fast, friendly, tasty Vietnamese. (but if you're looking for a great banh xeo - try ben thanh!)",

I almost always get the same entree #45. Vermicelli noodles with shrimp and pork over a delicate salad of iceberg, mint and cucumber, served with a citrusy dressing and carrot slaw. My husband gets #103 a spicy stir fry with everything in it.  The fried rice is also the best I have ever had. Vietnamese beer is crisp and delicious.  They do not offer dessert, you could try a sweet a Vietnamese iced coffee, or not.  A peanut butter biscuit and fortune cookie come with the check to finish off a perfect meal.",

    "text": "At long last, my search for good, authentic Vietnamese food has finally ended. Thanks to Yelp and a recommendation from a Vietnamese woman, I tried Lang Van for lunch and I'm only sorry that I didn't try it sooner. In my opinion, this place is head and shoulders above Ben Thanh, in every aspect.    I'll stop comparing prices with SoCal. It seems that Vietnamese food is generally $2.00 more than in SoCal, but for once, the food is worth it.   The neighborhood isn't the greatest. The exterior may not look like much. But what it has going for it is easy parking, a pleasantly decorated interior, very friendly and attentive service and pretty outstanding Vietnamese food.   We were warmly greeted by the family who runs the restaurant. The people who work here are really, really nice. They have a large menu with some great staples and some unique dishes.   My husband's favorite is the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. I felt a little more adventurous and had the Cary Ga (yellow chicken curry). See my photos for Lang Van.   The portion here is just right, bordering on the more generous side. Everything is carefully prepared, perfectly flavored and well-presented. I have not a single complaint (and I'm admittedly, a Vietnamese food snob).   It's evident that the chefs here have skills, a refined palatte and stay True to the dish.  The meat for the Bun Thit Nuong was perfectly cooked and delicious. Ample vermicelli noodles, meat, lettuce, mint and my favorite crushed peanuts on top. This is a pretty accessible dish for beginners (slightly sweet, savory, lots of textures).  I rarely ever order yellow chicken curry at a Vietnamese restaurant because I remember how my mom used to make it and I'm always disappointed. Lang Van makes it even better. It's nothing like Thai curry (so don't expect it), but it is healthier and more delicately flavored. Sweet potatoes, onions, broth, curry flavor and tender chicken served with your choice of rice or baguette. I went with rice. Even my husband enjoyed it. But it's not for everyone, especially those who are used to thick coconut sauce Thai curry. This is more soupy in texture, but just as delicious.   I will definitely be back here again. Not only was the Vietnamese food here good by Charlotte standards, it was good by any city's standards, probably some of the best, simple Vietnamese food I've had in a long time. Charlotte needs more Vietnamese restaurants like this one. This is a must try for any Vietnamese food aficionado and if you've never had Vietnamese food, try this one and you're likely to convert.",

The staff was friendly and very helpful with any menu questions we had. If you like a good sweet iced coffee try it here! It's fun to make and yummy to drink. Hot coffee filters through your cup onto some good ole sweetened condensed milk, just stir and pour over your ice and BAM instant deliciousness.  Be prepared for a large menu, I can only say I got the #109 which was very good. A healthy helping of vegtables, and beef with a side of rice.  I also shared some garden rolls with my co-workers.

    "text": "After spending the early afternoon at the Charlotte Museum of History, my husband and I found Lang Van nearby. (We ran into another group that just finished the museum there as well. I'm sure that happens often.)  Similar to other reviews, the outside of the building is very plain. However, as we walked in there are decorations of bamboo sticking up around the tables and it was open and bright. We received a warm greeting.  The menu is a bit overwhelming because they offer over 130 items to choose from. Some dishes (mainly vegetarian) were just under $10, while many dishes were $11 to $15. We ordered #2 Summer roll for an appetizer and the Green beans and tofu (based on a prior review and it was a recommendation of our server).   The Summer roll was great! Just enough for us to both try one. The dipping sauce was delicious. The green beans and tofu was very good. I'm not a big fan of a lot of onions, so I had to pick around them in this dish. The tofu was great. The portion was enough for us to share and we were very full at the end.   We received a lot of attention and our glasses of water never ran dry! The little cookies at the end (when we got the bill) were a nice little treat...just the right amount of sweet. We will definitely return over and over again so we can begin to try more of their many dishes.",

    "text": "We went without a reservation at about 715 on a Saturday night, and although there was a line, only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Unfortunately, that good thing is also the only thing I can ding this place for, and that is they do rush to get you out of there, and I don't like to be rushed when eating.  Otherwise, this place is amazing. This is the third time I have been here and I love it. I could not wait to bring my visiting daughter here and she was blown away also.  She ordered the Bun Nem Nuong (meatball with vermicelli),and although the flavors were amazing, I think she was a little disappointed that the meat was actually more like a slice of barbequed spam. I had the same type of dish, but with sliced beef and salad and it was excellent. I have traveled to Vietnam, so I have to say that this visit to Lang Van was like the others, in that the food is very authentic.  We both ordered a Vietnamese \"33\" beer - ice cold and great with the meal.  Unfortunately, every time I put my chopsticks down for a moment, someone would come and try to take my bowl. I did not know how to impress upon our server to back off without being rude, but she was good natured when I just kept saying, \"please, not yet.\" Nonetheless, I love Lang Van, and can't imagine not going back.",

It forced me out of my Vietnamese comfort zone and I broke away from the Pho for Vermicelli -  BUN GA NUONG to be exact.   The mixture of flavors in this dish gave my mouth an orgasm.  Mint mixed with chili pepper sauce.  I really wanted to order a 2nd dish to take home but this gives me reason to drive across town to come back.  The service was exceptional.  We never had to wait for drink refills.  Of course tea drinkers had their own pitchers on the table.  The food came out quick and was hot, very appetizing and very affordable for the portion you received.  The only bad thing was the booth we were seated in was a bit tight for 4 people and to me it was very uncomfortable.  But overall, this is another Charlotte gem!",

We had a beef pho and lemongrass beef curry. Each was ok, the pho better than the other dish. At $3.75 for two tiny spring rolls, that seemed excessive. Tasty spring rolls though. A somewhat better value were the summer rolls with shrimp and a delicious hoisin/peanut sauce. Service was gracious and above average and the atmosphere was fine.",

    "text": "We were in the area for Carolina Rebellion, and being that I'm homesick and missing my mom's cooking I searched for a vietnamese restuarant to go to.  I should have turned around and left the restuarant when I walked in and was greeted by Vietnamese people dressed up in uniforms and acting all friendly.  I know there is nothing wrong with friendly service, but this restuarant is geared more to white people, and they charge you out the behind for the amount of food that you are getting.  This might be the fact that we are in the \"south\" and there isn't a large Vietnamese population in NC.  If you are in Seattle, San Diego, or Boston, a small bowl is probably $5-6 and a large is $7-8 or so.    When you first come in they'll seat you and come back in like 5 minutes or so and ask you if you want appetizers.    Ordered Bo Bia spring rolls for apps, cause I haven't had them in a while. They are good.  I ordered the Banh Canh Cua, and the waiter tried to suggest that I order something else, because he didn't think I knew what I was ordering.  I stuck with what I wanted, and the food came out in a huge bowl which barely had any food and lots of broth.  This dish is suppossed to have long strands of thick white noodles (about 6 inches in length), and I got 1/2 inch strands of noodles that looked like they were meant for a little kid who couldn't use chopsticks to eat.  OH  and Cua is crab, and guess what I got instead, imitation crab.  For $8.95, I pretty much got a kids portion of food.   The husband ordered the a pho dac biet, and they bring out a pho with only slices of beef and charged him $9.95 or so for a kids size amount of noodles and beef with tons of broth, which should have come out with meatballs, tendons, and bunch of other stuff.  The broth was good, but it was salty.  I love salt, but if you have their broth, plan to be really thirsty later on.    Don't get me wrong, their food taste authentic, its just they have taken short cuts on quality and portion size to the American Clientel that they have visiting the establishment.  They time we were there, the only people I saw was white.    Atmosphere, its kind of weird that they partioned the dining room in to two sections by bamboo divinding thingys.  You are seated in these green booths, and if you are above average size i think they have tables and chairs.   The restuarant was kinda dark and dingy in my opinion, and they have vietnamese style music playing in the background.   I think that Durham has better Vietnamese food in NC.  The price is about the same in Durham, but the quality and amount of food that you get is what you are paying for.    Side question: why are you being offered a fortune cookie, tamrand candy, and sesame cookie at the end of the meal?  I didn't know I was eating at a chinese restuarant.",

The complexity of flavors and the perfect combination of ingredients makes for an experience that far surpasses any expectations I had.   The portion sizes are perfect-not too big and not too small, the service was superb and the special dessert treat at the end by far beat the fortune cookie you usually get. ( but don't worry, if you love fortune cookies, you get one of those too!)  When is it too soon to go back???",

Once, I found myself looking around for my leather jacket, and became alarmed when I realized the last time I had worn it was at Lang Van a week ago.  I entered the restaurant at 5pm before any customers showed up and the owner greeted me with a big grin, revealing she had kept my jacket under the register counter for the whole week.  The staff will fill your water glass with such frequency and alacrity you will be amazed.  Go three times, and the owner will remember you and what you eat.  Take your parents once, and she will always ask about them.  Do yourself a favor and just have her order for you!  The first thing she chose for me is still my favorite.  The food is amazing, but the staff at Lang Van are the best to their regular customers!",

It was delicious, with a marvelous roasted bone broth. The basil and other garnishes were very fresh and delicious. I had not nearly finished my bowl, but had taken a moment to quietly savor the flavors and the warmth in my belly, when the hovering began.   At that time, there was apparently no coordination of bus service, water-glass refilling, etc.  I hope they've resolved this by now, because being asked five times in 10 minutes \"are you finished?\" \"Can I take your bowl?\" \"May I clear that?\" etc., etc., really detracted from my otherwise lovely experience.",

Disclaimer- I am from NYC and our Asian food is nearly unparalleled outside of California and Asian countries. ( proud NJ/NYC foodie)   However - I was not impressed with the food at all. It was super basic. The flavors weren't large or bright and the herbs didn't work to brighten any spices that may or may not have been cooked in the food.   Honestly the service was the highlight. The staff appeared to be very knowledgeable about the patrons and many seemed to have lasting ling term relationships. Great.   The location is a little shady and the outside is not pretty at all.   But I want delicious Vietnamese Food that makes me feel like I am eating something fresh and authentic.. not white washed bland Asian food.   I would go again... but I would not take anyone here...",

As always, it was delicious.   Lang Van is out there as far as the location. From South Charlotte, it took me almost an hour arrive there. . But, that was with traffic and lots of stop lights to get to its location near Eastway and Sharon Amity.  As the crow flies, it's not all that far.  It is well worth the drive.   Very clean and a quiet atmosphere. Perfect as a place for a meeting of the minds!  I have been coming here for years, but sometimes forget about it due to its location.  Every time I eat their food, I am reminded what a fabulous place it is.  If you haven't been, GO!  If you have been, GO BACK!  It is consistently superb.   Five Stars all the way around.",

My husband and I went to Vietnam for our honeymoon, so we are constantly on the lookout for the best Vietnamese places.  There was a tiny wait when we got there, but it was to be expected on Valentine's Day. The staff was very kind and got us seated as quickly as they could. And everyone is right, they do not let your water Get Low ever.  We ordered an appetizer that I haven't been able to find since our trip to Vietnam. It is a pork dish where you assemble spring rolls yourself and top it with peanut sauce. It is delicious. I felt it was a bit pricey at $15, but so worth it.  My husband ordered pho and I had Curry. The pho was the obvious winner. Large portion for the price.   Not Vietnamese prices unfortunately, haha. Everything was very good. Our new Vietnamese staple.",

The customer service though was the best part.  Everyone on the staff did something for us in one way or another: clearing dishes, greet us, serve us, refill water...I think we had at least 6 different employees come to our table.  They are so fast and still very nice.  I would definitely come back to try their other dishes.",

    "text": "As often as I come here, I can't believe I've never written a review. Probably because I'm too busy downing delicious Pho .   I came here for the first time on a Friday in the fall in search of Charlotte's best Pho. And after kissing a few Pho frogs . I found my Pho-ever Prince  Thanks to Yelp for the advice.   When I first visited it was for lunch and the parking lot was packed. I knew right then that this was it.   When I walked in, I was still greeted warmly and seated immediately.  With very little hesitation, I ordered the Pho Tai. After 10 maybe 15 min a huge, piping-hot bowl of pho  arrived. (Note: They only do one size of Pho and it's huge but trust me you'll want it all.)   Before I even added a sprig of basil, a spritz of lemon , a slice of jalapeno or a bean sprout, I leaned in and took a spoonful of broth. It was heavenly, flavorful umami goodness. I grabbed my chopsticks and sampled the  beef: it was tender and flavorful. The perfect melding of flavors left me wondering: did the beef flavor the broth or did the broth flavor the beef?  (Chicken or the egg ) The noodles still had that perfect al dente texture. All of the condiments were super fresh. I added them all and then I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. I didn't want to waste even a drop of broth.   That's how I fell in love with Lang Van. Afterwards...  I ate Pho here everyday for a week. No exaggeration. It is legitimately it's good.   Since our first encounter I've also had the tofu bun and both the shrimp and tofu summer rolls both of which are divine and the pho chay (tofu bun).   Beware: the sauce that comes with the summer rolls is so delicious you could drink it.   But alas, the pho is my first love. A healing serum for the soul. If I'm sick and won't eat anything else, I will always eat pho . But it's gotta be from here. All other Pho shall forever pale in comparison.   If you're on the fence about this you shouldn't be. I love Lang Van so much that I'm willing to share her with everyone! Don't shirk my kindness. Nike said it best, \"Just Do It.\"  You won't be sorry.",

I worked my way through college waiting tables at a small-town, family owned Vietnamese restaurant, and have been looking for (many) years for food as good we served there. Lang Van looks like a great Asian place--basic diner furnishings with colorful posters on the walls, lots of green plants, and an extensive menu. It is very clean. The service is friendly and attentive. BUT the nuoc cham, a staple condiment of the cuisine, was watered down and too sweet. If it did contain any nuoc mam (fish gravy), it was hard to taste. The Imperial (spring) rolls were good, but very small. Other portions were generous, and everything seemed fresh. But that characteristic tang of the sauce was missing. All the seasonings seemed toned down from what I remember, possibly to make the place more appealing to American palates. It was OK, and unless we find a better place for Vietnamese, we will probably go back--we need to try the pho, because we did not order it this time--but I will order twice as many spring rolls as we think we can eat, and how I will miss that tangy sauce!",

Vietnamese Iced Coffee finishes brewing at you table on to Sweetened Condensed Milk as you would expect in a Vietnamese restaurant!  The Fresh Rolls are Excellent and the \"Peanut\" Sauce is Hoison Sauce with a little bit of Copped peanuts, like most Vietnamese Restaurants!  You can get a Sweet and Sour \"Fish\" Sauce if you do not care for the so called \"peanut\" sauce!  The Service is ATTENTIVE! !!  If service is going to be extreme I would prefer too much over too little!  To me the Service is Excellent here!   If I'm Craving Lemongrass Curry with Beef or Chicken on a Wednesday or when my main squeeze for most Vietnamese food is on Vacation 10 days every July, I'm heading to Lang Van!

Ordered a rice dish with meat (forgot if it was pork or beef)) , and it was 80% rice, 10% vegetables (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) and 10% MEAT! My grilled skewer had 4 EXTREMELY SMALL pieces of meat on it, not even enough to fill up the whole skewer.  It was obvious that they were being stingy on their meat. The portion was so sad.  I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants in different cities (and even others in Charlotte) and have never been served so little meat for this dish.  Basically paid for a plate of rice and some vegetables. Some of my friends' dishes were better, but as for mine, it was so pathetic that I would never recommend anyone to come here.  Wish I might have had a better experience by ordering something else, but a restaurant can't skimp out on their main ingredients so obviously like that.  One of my friends ordered the Pho and it was lacking on meat, too..but not as badly as my dish.  Only thing I liked about the place was the Vietnamese coffee, but that's definitely not enough to redeem them. Not ever coming back here again!",

I have had much more expensive/fancy dining experiences in the city, but I've not had food so good or service that is even in the same ballpark.  The owner is simply amazing. She remembers everyone! She knows where we sat, what we ate and is a treasure. When we were overwhelmed by the menu or unsure about what to try, she has been ready to make something just for us to meet our tastes. And while she is a one of a kind lady, her staff are all good too, all very friendly and attentive.  I wish that I could try more of her menu, but I love the Bun so much that I might cry if I went here and didn't get it. Bun is so simple, and until I got it here at Lang Van I was mostly of the opinion that Bun is Bun. Some better than others, but the differences were minor. But at Lang Van it was incredible. Each of the meats was delicious on its own, and the crisp rolls are tasty as well.  The wife isn't as addicted to Bun as I am, so she tries more on the menu and is never disappointed. I get to try her dishes as well, so best of both worlds for me. We get the fresh summer rolls, as they are always great and my wife would probably divorced me in order to marry that peanut sauce if it were an option.  We finish everything off with the coffee and leave incredibly happy. You definitely should go here. Go here often. Stop reading reviews and go! Now!",

Lang Van has the best tofu of just about any restaurant I've ever been to. The tofu lemongrass rolls are a must. Their entire vegetarian menu is great, including the curry tofu, hot pot, asparagus with tofu, and if you're feeling adventurous, the roll your own rolls. Everyone that works there is incredibly nice, always making us feel like family. And when the owner remembers what everyone in your party ordered the other times you've been here, that's really nice.   This is my favorite restaurant ever.",

Occasionally there will be a small language barrier if you want something explained on the menu. But hey, it's a traditional joint, what do you expect!? Highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Amazing dining experience here!   Came with mom for a late brunch; she was craving how fun which is stir fried rice noodles.   This place has been opened FOREVER - as far back as I can remember. Same sweet owner bussing tables, taking orders, greeting patrons and running the show from top to bottom. I haven't been back in years because it's so far from my house but coming back today brought back so many memories. The hood, the parking lot, the smiling faces from the hard workers. And most importantly, the food.   Moms and I each shared a spring roll and summer roll. They have some of the best spring rolls I've ever eaten, very similar to the home made ones from my mom. Dare I say they're even better? The nuoc mam (fish sauce dipping sauce) is even better. Not too fishy, perfectly balanced flavors. I want to just buy a bottle of their sauce.   And the rice noodles?!?! Oh, so good. They use fresh rice noodles charred in a wok over high heat. Then top it with a stir fry of meats, veggies in a rich flavorful gravy. It's so good! I used to eat the dish after school during my high school days. Today I was that 17 year old girl again having lunch with my friends in the local hood joint.   I hope they stay open forever. I'll have to make it a point to come back more often.",

    "text": "I'll start with the upfront disclosure: Vietnamese food is not my favorite Asian cuisine.  I don't seek it out as often, I don't have as much exposure to the full variety of dishes or restaurants, and I'm probably comparing everything I eat to other Asian dishes and flavors I prefer.  So, big grain of salt on this review if you're a Vietnamese connoisseur.  Overall, this was a good experience and it was tasty and relatively cheap.  I mean, compared to everything in the Uptown area.  If this was within walking distance to Uptown, I'd go back.  Probably a lot.  But it's not.  So this might be a 1x/year place for me.  I personally ordered three appetizers, one soup, and four main entrees.  I also accidentally ordered a sweet tea (which was SWEEEEEEEET and came out in a quart-sized pitcher) and purposefully ordered a frozen blended jackfruit drink.  There were also 3 other main dishes and 2 other appetizers on the table, some of which I tried.  Everything was good.  Nothing was outstanding.  Oh, wait.  The service.  The service was outstanding.  Just like being in a long-lost aunty's kitchen (without the noise of being in a kitchen).  Here are some of the highlights.  The drinks were cool.  I asked for water without ice.  That came out in a special pitcher for me so that I could refill myself and none of the staff tried to refill me with ice.  That was nice.  That was really nice.  The sweet tea was an accidental order and man was it sweet.  It also came out in its own pitcher.  So I didn't sleep that night from having downed a pitcher of sweet tea.  I had hoped for a boba, bubble tea, or jelly smoothie (see my disclaimer above) but ended up with a jackfruit drink.  It was frozen blended and tall.  It was good.  The coconut drink I tried to order first wasn't available (and apparently hadn't been for months).  There were Buddha beers in Buddha shaped bottles and multiple wines on the table, too.  Plus the GM/Aunty came by and had some drinks with us before we left.  The wine glasses were small and cute but always came out super full.  The DIY summer rolls were fun and the greens and herbs were super fresh.  The meats, though, were a little overwhelming and I wished there was more lettuce and sauce.  The pancake was new to me and fun, super glad I ordered that.  Like a crispy dried egg.  Different from any other Asian cuisines' pancakes so worth a try for sure.  The corn soup was crazy hot when it came out.  Crazy hot.  Beware.  The fried tofu was good but the onions with it was a bit odd.  Yes, the pineapple fried rice comes in a pineapple.  That's fun.  But the rice flavor itself wasn't very strong and the dish definitely needed more egg.  Nice that the shrimp tails were already pulled off.  Huge plus for me.  The coconut curries were a bit runny and didn't have enough vegetables.  The lemon grass curry was super interesting--more like a paste than a curry--but didn't have any vegetable!  The noodles dishes were ok, but felt unbalanced.  I might try for additional veggie stir fry dishes but generally wasn't impressed with the underlying flavor.  Lots of meat present, though, if that's your thing.  We wanted to order dessert, but the check was brought out directly--along with a typical \"please leave now\" dish full of sweets. The shortbread cookies were a hit with half the table and the jin dui (sesame balls of fried mochi) was a hit with the other half.  No one seemed to like both.  Dinner ended up being under $50 pp for six people, with lots of alcohol and maybe four meals' worth of leftovers.  Not bad.",

The service was top notch, very fast (maybe too fast at some points) we were seated as soon as walked in LITERALLY and asked what we wanted to drink before we could open the menu which seemed a bit rushed at first. The food was unique, delicious, and plentiful and there is something for EVERYONE here. There are about 100+ items on the menu so I will definitely return without hesitation! Parking is scarce in the front so I believe there is additional parking behind the restaurant.",

Just subbed it with some tiny shrimp and dropped it off at the table. They admitted they ran out only after I spoke up.  My wife got the Mi Dac Biet which is egg noodle special and usually comes with a very specific broth. It came out in Pho broth.. Not sure if it was a mistake or if they normally make it that way but either way it's awful. Included a picture of the \"roast pork\" as well.   Saving grace was service was okay and food came out fast. If you want authentic Vietnamese food, go elsewhere!",

I can see why.   To start the meal we got two spring rolls and Vietnamese steamed rolls. The spring rolls were just crispy , crunchy and tasty! The Vietnamese rolls were my favorite! Not because I think the look cool but they were refreshing too.   So the first time I went I got the pineapple  tofu  dinner and I was hooked! It comes in a pineapple. Yea I know ! Say what?!?!!  It is the simple things in life! There is just something about food or drinks serve out of itself that just impresses me!   I did ending up stepping out of my box because I am a big fan of soup base meals I went with the Pho Tha. I added spices to it and it was worth every tear! Can't describe in words the flavors I experienced . I experienced it and I am hooked. I hope to see you there the next time I am here!",

My best tip would be either go for the pho or tell your server what you like and let them choose for you. The menu is so extensive, having your server choose for you is an interesting way to try our new things. Their beer and wine is cheap, as well. Just beware, this place is popular and the parking is limited. Go early!",

With so many delicious options, I wasn't sure what I wanted.  I told the waitress I liked spicy.  She asked if I liked chicken and shrimp, and whether I liked rice or noodle.  With that info, she said OK I got you.  I'm not used to letting someone decide my entree but I was feeling adventurous and was pleasantly surprised with what I got... chicken and shrimp lemongrass curry.  I could have taken more heat, but it was good.  I also had a tasting of the chicken curry and the flavors were amazing.   Great flavors, delicious food, and good service.",

I've been to Lang Van approximately ten times over the past ten years and had always thought it was so-so - until today when I went for lunch on a Saturday soon after they opened.  The pork in the bun thit nuong was the worst I've ever had - tough as if it had been frozen after cooking and full of fat and gristle.  The pork marinade was extremely weak in flavor - again, as if it had been frozen.  The bean sprouts were limp but still overshadowed by the poor excuse of what should have been fresh chargrilled pork.  Next I ordered ca ri ga (curried chicken) and the first thing I noticed is the chicken was the potato-chip-looking type that ships frozen in 20 pound plastic bags (the lowest grade chicken you can buy).  Add to that the fact that the sweet potato had a crumbly texture as if it was frozen after it was cooked, and reheated in a microwave.  The curry tasted completely homogeneous with no distinct taste of ginger, garlic, curry, or lemongrass.    If you want good Vietnamese I recommend Vietnam Grill on South Blvd where you can often smell the chargrilled pork being cooked as you drive past - for a lower price.",

When I saw we were about to pass it, I made my friend turn around since I've heard such wonderful things about this place from good ole Yelp! I've been wanting to check this place out before but didn't want to go at it alone since I am GPS-less and not too sure about that area of town.   It was crowded for a Wednesday night-people must have came out of the wood works to come here. The restaurant itself is very clean and service was awesome. They gave us just enough time to scan the menu but didn't leave us hanging for them to come back so we could order. And they really care about hydration at Lang Van and I dig that.   But sadly, service didn't make or break the whole experience in this scenario ---I just wasn't blown away by this place as I expected to be. The food was good however I ordered a dish with bbq meatballs and ended up getting something else and when my friend tried to order one item, the lady told her that she didn't want that and suggested something else instead. So a bit confused about that whole process but perhaps I could be down for someone else deciding what I am going to get in another situation? It was just odd.",

Service here is always impeccable.  During this visit, the server brought us complimentary summer rolls featuring crispy tofu and the most incredible peanut sauce. For my meal, I ordered number 72, fried rice noodle with mixed vegetables and crispy tofu in garlic sauce.  I liberally added their wonderful hot sauce and was in pure heaven.  They also offer wine and beer, so I enjoyed their house Chardonnay after a hard day's work. At the end of the meal, we were given a plate of sweets.  Fortune cookies, little candies, these round cake like things and this sesame covered delicacy filled with bean paste.  I am not a dessert person, but these morsels were not cloyingly sweet. The menu is very extensive, and Lang Van boasts that they can turn any dish into a veg friendly one.   Veggies and hot sauce!  Just my style.",

    "text": "06/20/10  (Not so) fresh in Charlotte (we took the red-eye flight in), Mom and I were driven here by my sister and her son straight from the airport for some good Vietnamese fare.  She's been here before with coworkers, so she knew we'd enjoy the food (I turned her onto Thai green curry, and she knew Mom liked pho).  As we got out of the car, she said that this place was a hole-in-the-wall (the outside certainly screamed of it), but I'd already come across reviews from Charlotte yelpers, so I knew the food was, at the very least, decent.  I told her it wasn't me she should be apologizing to about the dive-y aspect of LV, but I digress...  Well!  Whatever LV lacks in looks outdoors, it certainly made up for indoors-- this place doesn't look like a dive at all!  It's actually pretty cozy indoors, with warm paint hues, wall accents, and floral decor.  Staff seemed friendly enough, with sincere smiles and perky greetings at the ready.  That is, up until I started taking photos* of my durian shake.  Duri-what, you say?  But I'm getting ahead of myself...  We started off with glasses of water all around and a durian shake.  Well, first I asked what our server would recommend- the soursop or the durian shake?  She said she liked the flavor and consistency of the durian, but that I should really go for the avocado.  Now, we're from the Philippines, so we all know about soursop, durian, and avocado, so I get what she was trying to tell me.  Unfortunately, I have an avocado allergy, so that's a no-go.  (Why, oh why can't I be allergic to a food I hate??)  So, I went w/ the stinky durian.  If you've ever come across durian, you know it's not a scent you'd readily reach a bottle of and spray on yourself willingly (you might as well reach for a skunk), but many food addicts will agree with me, it makes for a mighty tasty and creamy beverage!  OMG, how I wanted to order another one, and I wasn't even finished with the first!  Our mom agreed with me; my sister didn't.  Sadly, bec. her son heard of his mom's aversion, he wasn't willing to give it a go.  Oh, well.  More for us!  Our server came back and took the rest of our order: fresh summer rolls app (goi cuon) for Mom and sis; eggrolls (chia gio) and a chicken skewer on vermicelli for the little one; a stir-fried shrimp with steamed veggies for Mom; a chicken curry with stewed sweet potato chunks for sis; and beef lemongrass curry for me.  All rolls came wrapped with rice paper; non-noodle dishes came with rice, with the exception of my selection, which came over shredded lettuce, sauteed onions, crisp alfalfa sprouts, and chopped parsley.    Nephew loved the eggrolls!  So much so, he didn't even touch his chicken skewer and noodles.  Mom and sis enjoyed the shrimp dish, but eschewed the chicken and sweet potato curry, stating that the chicken \"fingers\" were dry and flavorless.  (Indeed, they looked like pieces that normally are subject to the blanch and shock methods of cooking to be later used in stir-fried and curry-fried dishes.)  Mom, sis, and I agreed, however, that the stewed sweet potato chunks were delicious; the one-note sweet flavor in this curry dish came from the sweet potato.  I think the dish would've been better served with beef...  It was unanimous- the best dish in the entire meal was the beef lemongrass curry!  I was tempted to order medium-spice, but I wanted Mom to enjoy it, as well, so I chose mild, and were we all glad that I did!  Perfectly spiced (apparently, Viet-mild is hotter than Thai-mild), the beef was very flavorful, salted just so, and was oh-so-tender that it almost melted in your mouth, yet had enough of a chew to it that you knew you were having stir-fried meat.  Y'know what I'm sayin'?  Oh, forget what I'm trying to say and just order a plate and taste what I mean for yourself!      With such a spread, we didn't order any desserts- the shake was decadent enough.  However, the bill arrived with a few of those tamarind-flavored candy, as well as these ab-fab mini peanut-cookie morsels!  I am now on a quest to hunt a bag (or two, or three!) of these to take back home!  No, they're not made in-house, so perhaps someone can tell me where I can find some?  *Try to keep the photos to a minimum.  All of the smiles from other servers disappeared once I started taking photos of the shake, and later, the food.  Our server kept up with the smiles, though.",

    "text": "Lang Van is a little overpriced and overrated.  Sure, the food is good, but it is Americanized Vietnamese and I guess it shows since the clientele are mostly American.  We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy.  So busy that we got the last remaining open table.  We ordered fried spring rolls and two bowls of pho dac biet.  Whenever I get pho, I always order the dac biet since it includes everything.  The dac biet here was seriously lacking in ingredients and portion size.  I finished my bowl in no time and I did not leave full.  This is the first time a bowl of pho did not fill me up.  Not only that, but one bowl is $8.95!  (Bowls at most other pho shops start at $2-3 less.)  Maybe I'm just used to all the Vietnamese pho shops up and down Buford Highway in Atlanta, but the pho here was kind of a joke.  There were much less noodles and no tripe in the soup.  Also, instead of giving us limes to eat with the pho, they gave us *lemons* - another first.  Anyhow, while the food itself is good, the portions are lacking and the prices are jacked up.  I'm sure there are better, more authentic Viet places in Charlotte.",

It is light and tastes delicious.  This is something that is extremely rare, even in California where all the V's reside.    I ordered the hu tieu xao dac biet (forgot what its called in English) and it was very good too.  There were 3 or 4 types of meat in it and some of it was a bit overcooked but that's pretty normal for a dish like this (since they cook everything together) unless you're paying top dollar for it.  The noodles, however were AMAZING.  Cooked to perfection and it had a great flavor to it.    Service was excellent.  Everyone was extremely nice and multiple servers came by to check up on us even though it was busy that day.  Overall, this place is great if you want some authentic Vietnamese food and offers a very fair price.",

I think I kept my volume reasonable) she hung back.  Got a bowl of pho.  I suppose I shouldn't have, because I know you're supposed to put the cilantro in to get the full flavor, and I loathe, detest, and abhor the vile herb.  So I loaded up on sprouts, lettuce, basil and lemon, and popped in a few slivers of jalapeno.  Tasty bowl of soup, but for me, nothing to come back again and again for.  I learned to let the sprouts sit for a while so that they would soften and their uh, healthy flavor would subside.  Overall solid and enjoyable.  I might return and try something else.",

She remembers people's orders after years of not visiting. When we go in there she just says ok usual for you right? and I'm like what's my usual and she tells me and I'm like yep. She also will give good advice on what to pick if you don't know the menu. Usually she will just tell you what to get just by looking at you. I get a kick out of it. She really loves her business.

You know, the boy/girl who, upon first inspection seems a little disheveled and oddly shoed, and only wants to talk about the first release of the first Joy Division album and you're all audible eyerolls but then:  you notice the fragile bow of their upper lip and their adorable husky laugh and the canary yellow socks that accompany their unselfconscious pigeon toes and suddenly you just want to get married?  I KNOW.  me too.  They're in a weird half-intersection that's a bit of a clusterfuck next to a used car-lot.

You could drive right by Lang Van and never know.    The food.  Made me want to write Neruda-style love poems about it.  Sparkling basil, mint, and cilantro flavors like new cherry blossoms on warm spicy broth saplings.  I stuffed myself to the point of discomfort simply to try and pinpoint where the star anise flavor ended and the beef began.  The pho is better than any you've ever had.  Swear.  Top 5: -The pho.  doye. -the do it yourself spring roll things with the bowl of hot water.  do it. -Banh Xeo, yellow pancake.   -Crispy quail. -The specials.

We thought that there was no duck, but we now know that there is duck, she just doesn't want us to eat the duck. We have no idea why, but we just go along with whatever she says).   The summer roles are delicious.   We always end up staying longer than planned. We always end up with coffee and talking to the owner and our friends. They don't mind if you linger over your food.

    "text": "11/28/17-I must say that Lang Van has some of the best pho in town. It's very popular so if you plan to visit for dinner, I'd recommend going before 6pm. The menu is extensive, which can be overwhelming. No fear, the staff is super friendly and will gladly answer any questions.  I've had the spring rolls, the Pho Tai Gan, and the country soup. The spring rolls were filled with fresh ingredients and served with a mildly spiced peanut sauce. Don't skip on the sauce. The Pho Tai Gan pho soup was delicious. I would've liked the broth to be higher in temperature. That didn't stop me from turning the bowl up to get every bit of broth at the bottom of the bowl.  I loved the contrast in textures of the chewy tendon and thinly sliced beef.  I liken the country soup to a fancy chicken noodle soup, minus the egg noodle, add fresh broccoli. This dish is the perfect comfort food for any day. It was very flavorful with the perfect ratio of broth to veggies, noodles, and chicken.  Lang Van is pretty consistent in service and quality of food. If you're one who orders the same dish at your favorite restaurants, this place is for you. If you're one who likes to try new dishes at your favorite restaurants, this place is for you.  A win-win in my book.",

The only positive thing about it was the temperature but that's it. Extremely slow service did nothing to help either.   To me they rank amongst the worst made Pho in CLT, along with the likes of VietThai noodle house and the new Pho Ngon. Waste of money if you are serious at all about how a Pho should taste.",

I think I'll go for anything tofu next time as I preferred it over the meat.  Service felt good but I felt rushed like they had a line outside. Overall decent place with cool decor & okay food.

    "text": "There is awesome Vietnamese food in southern California.  However, we aren't in California anymore, and North Carolina isn't exactly known for its Vietnamese cuisine.  Lang Van, however, is easily on par with the best Vietnamese food I've had anywhere.  This place seems unassuming and maybe a little run down on the outside.  There's a big parking lot in the back, which isn't immediately obvious.  Inside, though, it's nicely maintained.  We had the temple rolls (fried tofu spring rolls) which came with a savory peanut sauce.  I've had many peanut sauces that were sweet and peanuttier, but this one had more soy sauce in it, and maybe some wine.  We ate every drop of it.  The rolls themselves were also excellent.  The tofu was perfect, and they were also filled with vermicelli, bean sprouts, and mint.    I had the fresh rice noodles (#72, I think).  This reminded me somewhat of Thai drunken noodles: wide, flat noodles, stir-fried with veggies and fried tofu in garlic sauce.  Mine came with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, snow peas, bean sprouts, and onions.  My husband had the special fried rice, and it was no problem for him to get it without shrimp.  While we both loved our meals, the menu is so big that I'll be tempted to try something else next time.  Instead of the usual fortune cookie, here you get what I like to think of as a mini dessert buffet: peanut cookies, fortune cookies, little tamarind candies.  Prices are a little high, but worth it for the quality of the food and service.  If it weren't for the fact that we live over two hours away, we'd probably have already gone back here.",

I got rice, which was great to soak in the curry sauce. I wanted French bread too, but they said they didn't have any.   My son got pho dac viet and loved the flavor of the broth. He said it was on par with his best friend's mother's homemade pho, which according to him is the best in the world, so there you go. :)  We got the fried spring roll appetizer and they were really good. The thin, tightly rolled egg rolls are the best. They even had dried mushrooms in them which added to the flavor. Very yummy.",

I have eaten literally a thousand bowls of pho from largest viet communities in orange county, seattle and all over vietnam, so I kind of know what I am talking about.  Their steak meat isn't even the right thickness.  This is consistent with my hypothesis that if the menu is too big, it is difficult to make everything tasty.  They charge $12 for a vermicelli bowl. Wtf, seriously? The fish sauce a bit on the vinegary side too.  You are just paying a premium for the wine-glassed water and cloth napkins.  Their spring rolls are ugly but tasty, but the again, any idiot can make good spring rolls.  You just need fresh ingredients and a decent sauce.  For pho, go to Pho Hoa.  I am sure every pho hoa in the nation boils their own broth.  I feel so bad for these folks who love this restaurant so much.",

It was not slammed busy when we arrived (maybe because we got there after the lunch rush), and was sat immediately. Within seconds (maybe a minute) we had water poured into our glasses and asked if we would like any other beverage as well - they have beer, wine, and soft drinks. After a few minutes, the server came by and asked if we would like an appetizer. We ordered the summer rolls. They were delicious! So fresh, and the sauce (peanut sauce) was yummy! We were talking a lot so it took us a while to order... my fiance and I ordered pho and she ended up ordering #108, which is a shrimp stir-fry with steamed rice. The pho is pretty amazing. The broth is flavorful but not overpowering. All the herbs are fresh. The noodles seemed like they were portioned out before hand because it was like a clump at the bottom of the bowl, but with a little twist or two they separated quite easily. The shrimp stir-fry looked delicious as well! I was too focused on my pho to even ask for a small taste of hers. Our glasses of water never went below half a glass and we were checked on numerous times. Once a person was done eating, their plates would not sit on the table more than a couple of minutes before an employee asked if they could take it for us. Their food is amazing and it is very family oriented. Two thumbs up!",

What an amazing dish which you can order to you liking of spicy. Be careful because if you do not specify it will be hot! This is served over lemon grass and bean sprouts. It's almost like an amazing spicy salad with wonderfully cooked beef. Served with white rice. Eat with chop sticks and boom your done. I can't wait to eat here again.

But in my opinion, it's one of the Queen City's gems.  I usually get my order to go, but it's always a real treat when I do get to eat there. The staff is friendly. The service is top notch. Don't know what you want? Tell your server what you like. He/she will help you order. If you're even a semi regular, they remember what you want... even down to the beverage. And I can promise you that your drink will never go empty. Someone is always there ready to fill your glass... sometimes after your first sip!  I love pho, or as I call it comfort in a bowl. My standard order is Pho Bo Vien (rice noodle soup with meatballs), spring rolls, and fresh summer rolls. Now you see why I often opt to pick it up... so no one can judge me on the amount of food I consume.  Lang Van is great place for those engaged in a mad, passionate love affair with Vietnamese food and also for the newbies. If you're a little weary about giving Vietnamese a try... don't be!",

This was one of the better ones, the broth was full of flavor, they only serve one size bowl but it was generous.   Don't let the rather worn and dated look of the building, or the decor, scare you away. If the rest of their cuisine is as good as their Pho then it's well worth the visit.  The service was attentive, and not just friendly but downright cheerful, like they were glad you were there, without being chummy or intrusive. It was a delight to eat there, if I am ever in Charlotte again this is where I will go for Vietnamese cuisine.",

Lang Van is a pretty popular restaurant here in the Queen City, but I never bothered to go since there's already 3 Vietnamese restaurants within 5 min of where I live. I'm not a huge fan of pho, but the pho here is one of the best I've had. The broth is very flavorful. However, the portion was really small and there was barely any meat (all Viet restaurants do this though). I didn't like the com tam very much there was nothing special about it. The staff are very nice and attentive; they all remembered me when I kept coming back and could recall what I ordered. One of the waitresses did mess up our order the last time, but the owner gave us a small discount so it was alright.   The main negative about this place is the parking. There's barely any spaces to park in especially during their busy hours, so I always avoid going here during dinner.",

However, I left with the feeling I wanted and that was not to feel stuffed.  I look forward to returning to the restaurant to try one of their hot pot dishes which I expect will grant them a higher rating on my part.",

This place is a bit out of the way and does not look very impressive from the outside, but we were impressed with what they serve.  The service is very attentive and efficient.  The first wow is the selection on the menu.  It took a while just to read through them and the selection is overwhelming.  Many of the items we've not seen before.  The Pho (I had the first item in the Pho section) is very good.  The broth is excellent and it didn't leave that MSG aftertaste so I know it was the real good stuff.  The pancake is crispy and tasty.  The spring roll (get the one that is cold and wrapped in rice cake skin, not the fried one) was pretty good.    The price was reasonable. A very enjoyable meal.  I'm not Vietnamese, but I've had my share of Vietnamese food, especially Pho.  This was one of the best.  I can't vouch for authenticity, but regardless, I enjoyed it.",

The pho soup base came out in a container and the broth was delicious. Soup was still piping hot when it got home.  The rare beef was laid out with noodles underneath in one container and another separate container with mint, basil and parsley with fresh bean sprouts on the side. Blended it all together in a soup bowl.   Crispy spring roll to go too and crunchy dipped in the sauce they provided for take out.  Will definitely be back for dinner.",

The menu is incredibly extensive-like 7 pages long. It could be overwhelming for those not used to Vietnamese food but luckily,  everything is good! My favorites are the lemongrass tofu and garlic tofu dishes but they also have plenty of good non vegetarian dishes if you prefer meat. My fiancee got a stuffed pineapple dish with shrimp and vegetables last time we went and he really enjoyed it (and it was so pretty too!). Anything with pork is also good here. I'm not supposed to eat pork due to allergies and pork's not usually my thing anyway but I make an exception for Lang Van's summer rolls with pork. I can deal with some itchiness and discomfort in exchange for the deliciousness :)  A trip here isn't complete without having one of the fruit smoothies. In addition to the usual  fruits, they also offer more exotic choices such as soursop and durian.   A meal here is capped off with a small plate of complimentary desserts-usually peanut butter cookies, tamarind candies, and fortune cookies. During my last trip here, they even gave the customers a thanksgiving treat in the form of an entire jar of the peanut butter cookies! They really know how to make customers feel special and appreciated!",

I guess they decided we weren't thirsty anymore.   I ordered #105 spicy. It was good, although I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of shrimp. I counted five shrimp to begin with and had hoped for more. That being said, the flavor was delicious and I really liked the rice noodles.   Overall, this place is alright.

    "text": "Lang Van doesn't look like much from the outside, and it's certainly not in the best location.  However, we had heard and read such good things about it that we had to give it a try.  We went there on a weeknight and it was crowded, so I can only imagine the waits on the weekends.  Fortunately, the restaurant has overflow parking in the back, since the front fills up pretty quickly.    The entry way and dining room is nicely laid out, considering the space it's in.  You walk down a walled hallway and there are dining rooms on either side.  I think they did a great job with the space to give it some atmosphere.  The big storefront windows allow in a lot of natural light, too.  I started with my Vietnamese favorite appetizer: summer rolls.  They're always so light-tasting, healthy, and delicious, and they come with a deliciously sweet peanut sauce.  (And they're usually very cheap!)  I always describe them as an unfried spring roll and, to me, a much better option.  I'll take them over a spring roll or egg roll any day.  The menu is HUGE.  And there are no pictures.  Unless you're VERY familiar with Vietnamese dishes, it's tough to know what to order.  We sat there for awhile, trying to decide what might be good.  I can't recall the name of it, but I ended up ordering a rice noodle dish that was full of meats, seafood, and veggies, mixed with some kind of white sauce.  It was very flavorful and fresh, and although I'd order it again, I'd love to try a variety of other Vietnamese options that I've never tried before.  Next time, though, we'll study up on the menu before we go. :)    Lastly, I must point out that the service was fast and friendly.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "This is, hands down, my favorite hidden hole-in-the-wall in Charlotte.  The problem is, it's not that big a secret anymore.  Pull up any evening and see the yuppie smattering of BMWs and SUVs lining the parking spaces at the front of this little unassuming building that houses such a number of tasty eats.  Add to that it's at the intersection of Eastway and Shamrock and the contrast is only that much more apparent.  That's right True Charlotteans- Eastway and Shamrock!  Double-check your locks before you head inside for some True Vietnamese delights.  As any regular knows, the place is actually run by a head female server who knows her customers to a fault and greets you with hugs and an almost scary photographic memory of what you like to eat and drink.  The top steak houses in the city can keep track of my visits all they want, but they still can't recite and confirm my order for me before I've even slid into one of the booths to prepare for the meal to come.  I kinda of like that, even if it locks me in before I've perused the menu.  Luckily, I've carved out a trio of favorites that the head server runs thru before we send the order back to the kitchen.    Highlights include summer rolls- tender rice paper wraps fresh shrimp mixed with greens, bean sprouts and mint leaves.  The star here, though, is really the peanut dipping sauce.  I unabashedly lick the little blow clean and have yet to find the equivalent anywhere else.  It adds the perfect mix of tang and savory to contrast with the fresh earthiness of the greens and mint leaves in the roll.  I could make a whole meal out of these.  For mains, I'm a big time fan of the lemongrass curries.  Be it chicken or tofu, the flavor here rules- delicate lemongrass with the base heat and pungency of curry.  The balance is near-perfect and I find myself using the side dish of rice to soak up every bit of the sauce.  The fresh cilantro on top is like icing on this cake.  I even love that you have the pull the herb's leaves off to mix in yourself- you control the strength of that element.  On colder nights, I also advocate the clay pot house special.  It's a mix of meats served with vegetables and a rice cooked in a savory tomato base all melding together in a very hot clay pot.  It warms me up and is one of those \"stick to your ribs\" dishes that leaves me full.  Meals are always finished off with a check and a couple mini peanut butter cookies, thicker than they are wider.  Nice and cakey, without being overly sweet.  You also get a tamarind hard candy, wrapped and perfect to open later.  On the weekends you also get the most wonderful sesame bun with a sweet bean curd filling.  I would threaten to cut my dining companions if they shut me out on this last piece, it is served hot and I could eat dozen if they'd let me.  In short, you get a get a mix of fresh herbs and savory sauces that are really perfect together.  The menu is many, many pages long, but do not fear- just tell the server what you like and trust in her.    Yes, the prices here are a notch above what you might expect, but I have found portion sizes to be generous and the wife and I get by usually sharing a single entree, especially after each having a couple of summer rolls.  The service, though, is especially efficient and expedient, even a single sip of water tends to generate a refill within seconds.  I can deal with that.  If you drink iced tea, they bring you a whole mini pitcher just for yourself.  Beware- I find their tea is brewed really strong and the sweet tea- well, hope you like the sugar you True Southerner, you.  If I had one complaint here, it's the soundtrack that is on endless loop.  Jazzy elevator music classics that are cheesier than any dish you will find on the menu.  I swear every time I walk in I am \"treated\" to \"My heart will go on\" the Titanic theme song and the theme song from Bonanza- all in the mellow, jazz style that is meant to stay in the background but ends up being that gnat in your ear that just won't go away.  Still, I don't come hear to enjoy the tunes.  I come to enjoy the food, and that, my friends, is superbly executed here.",

It is just good and overpriced for what they offer. I ordered a meal number 45. I got noodles, 4 pieces of crab, a tiny piece of beef and a tiny spring roll. The size was just right to feel not hungry, but not too full. It tasted really good. But for almost 13$ you sort of expect a little more than noodles, 4 crabs, a tiny roll and a tiny piece of meat. The meal literally cost them not more than 1.50$ -2$ to prepare.  I wished they had more soup varieties in smaller bowls as entrees. I don't want to pay 10$ and get a huge soup as I don;t always like to make a soup to my main dish. Also, I wished they had more authentic salads, like a lotus stem salad.   However, the place is clean, it was recommended to me, the staff is very friendly and make sure you have a good experience.The food tastes well.  Get there on time.

We started with the fried spring rolls and as soon as they landed at our table, we wished we had ordered the fresh summer rolls or garden delight rolls. The spring rolls were very small and typical fried Asian roll fare. Nothing to write home about, especially for $3.25! I ordered the vegetarian house special hot pot, which included fresh veggies and nicely fried tofu over tasty tomatoey rice. It was satisfying and fresh, but nothing special. We split the banh xeo (yellow pancake stuffed with pork and bean sprouts), and found it to be decent enough but not spectacular. My boyfriend ordered the pho dac biet (beef, tendon, and meatball) and said that his bowl didn't have enough noodles and was not exceptionally flavorful in any way. We left relatively satisfied, but certainly not feeling that the \"best in Charlotte\" reputation or the drive there was worthy.",

    "text": "Clean gourmet style pho restaurants are somewhat of an oxymoron. Most pho joints cater to the Asian public and personal experience has taught me that cleanliness and service aren't exactly top selling points. Lang Van is step away from that generalization; quite clean with impeccable service.   While the water was always full and plates were swiftly picked up, that service isn't quite what I was expecting. I'm the type that eats slow and enjoys lingering with my bowl of pho, sipping my broth even after the noodles are done. The broth here is quiet tasty, and when the waiter asked if I was finished, I felt obligated to save face and not look like a total oink. There's a fine line between good service and rushing a customer and I seem to be stuck somewhere in the middle of that line.   Fried spring rolls are top notch, but overall the pho is just mediocre. It's pricey and the portions appear to be child like. Noodles were scarce and the Dac Biet (special) was lacking a lot of meats. There wasn't anything special about it. I guess I should have read the description prior to ordering.   I know there's some method of madness to sit customers in a certain section, but with an empty restaurant, do you seriously have to sit us right smack next to someone? One of my pet peeves, sorry.   Lang Van still isn't my favorite, but cleanliness and good service is something that can't be overlooked.",

Sure enough friends of mine will carefully look over the menu say what they want then the manager will shake her head and say \"no, no\" \"what do you like? Shrimp, rice? I make you something\"   If you are smart you'll go with her suggestion because the food is good! I get the same thing every time: Chicken with flat noodles (might be #105 or 106 on the menu) and vegetables + shrimp spring rolls. [sidenote* the manager always remembers me and what I ordered even if it was months ago.]  The only bad thing about Lang Van is the location (far away from most and not the safest) but the food will keep you coming back.",

    "text": "I'll be honest; probably would not have tried out Lang Van on my own if it hadn't been from the great reviews I'd heard from the group of ladies with whom I went to the restaurant last night. Am working to branch out my taste buds, and this was the perfect opportunity.   To start, the service was absolutely amazing. Our server apparently has a freakishly good memory as she remembered those in our group who had been there before, and in some cases, even what they ordered! Our beverages were refilled constantly and it took very little time for our food to come out after ordering off of the ridiculously large menu.  Of course a couple of us decided to customize our orders, so I had the lemongrass chicken vermacelli. It was fantastic - so many different flavors and semi-healthy with a ton of veggies. For appetizers we had the summer shrimp rolls and the temple tofu rolls; both were very good. And speaking of tofu, I have never been a big fan - something about the texture and overall squishiness of it, but Lang Van has made me a convert. I tried my friend's tofu with garlic sauce and it was out-of-this-world. Not sure I'll try tofu outside of Lang Van, but would definitely order it here again on my next trip. And the coconut curry dish that I tried had melt-in-your-mouth potatoes with exquisite flavor.   The inside of the restaurant is very clean and there is plenty of parking, although I was surprised at how busy it was for a Tuesday night. And if you can't decide what to order, tell the server what you like and she'll custom make a dish for you that you'll love. The meal ends with delicious bite-sized peanut butter cookies that puts a perfect sweet ending to a great dining experience.",

As he has been a \"regular\" here for about 5 years. We were seated immediately and she asked if he wanted the regular, he nodded and before I knew it we had some spring rolls, some summer rolls, and a pitcher of iced tea. After scanning the enormous menu, I decided on basic rare beef pho #27. It was incredible! Food was all so fresh, the pho broth was perfect, my water glass never dipped below 3/4 full.  I can't wait to get back and try more!",

You don't know what you want no problem! Someone will suggest something for you. If you know what you do not want no problem! Something will be recommend and I guarantee it will not be a mistake. The best part is the peanut cookies, fortune cookies, and tamarind candies at the end of the meal. I have actually tried to bribe the hostess where she gets the cookies from but no such luck. I guess I need to keep going back to keep my cookie addiction under control. I give this place 5 stars because their service, spring rolls and vegetarian dishes are awesome.",
