If you like really good burgers and dogs with the best chili I have ever tasted, this is the place. This place is literally a hole in the wall, but you will find people from all walks of life standing in line. Their chili is one of a kind. It is very dry, not tomato based, lots of black pepper, very unique and delicious. They also serve breakfast, not bad but lunch is better.",

Inside: tight space standing room only (maybe six or so can fit without getting too icky), quintessential divey decor, old signs etc.  Ventilation system struggling to keep the smell of cooking food to a minimum.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Not a bad idea to call ahead and yes, have cash.  I'm trying to talk about all the great dive like qualities they have with out addressing the food.  I loved the vibe.  Ok.  The food?  Not so great.  The exalted chili?  Bland.  I detected some black pepper but salt not so much. It was meaty, give credit there. Ground beef cooked up with onions; that's what I saw(you can see them cooking) not much else.  Nothing to make it come together. I really liked all about them I experienced in the world of dives, but the food.  Just not there.  Is it a value?  Hard to say.  If I want to enjoy it? Not really. There's a place not too far that  gives loads of cheap food at ridiculous prices.  That's value. No matter how mediocre their service the food is at least seasoned.  I really wanted to like this place more.  The people and atmosphere seemed just right.  The food was just wrong.",

Finally visited the red sandwich house, after driving by it a couple of times always wondering why all those people were outside! With very limited hours it took me a while to get down here, as I don't work in the area, but thankfully a day off during the week enabled me to grab a bite!  Very small little 1 room \"house\". No frills, what you see is what you get. They have a flat top, deep-fryer, toaster oven to warm buns, a few heat lamps to keep fries hot, and that's about it. Walk in (if there is room), place your order, wait a few mins, pay and leave happy. Very basic food, burgers, dogs, sandwiches, and some good breakfast stuff from the looks of it as well.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, and it was great. Perfectly juicy, with that little bit of flat-top crustiness. And to top it off, its all super cheap. Can't wait to get back for another burger!",

It is literally a shack, and as soon as you walk in you're smoked out by the busy grill, but you don't even care, because you know you're smelling what's about to come. And you bet I enjoyed every bite of what's about to come. On top of that, I actually enjoyed standing outside at the table and eating alongside some strangers (whom I ended up getting to know). My mom and I got the fish filet sandwich, burger all the way, a burger with lettuce/tomato/slaw, and a liverwurst sandwich. She threw in cheese fries with her burger and I threw in hashbrowns with mine. THE HASHBROWN DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Everyone, PLEASE get the hashbrown. It's crispy, it's hot, and it's soft on the inside--exactly what you want out of your McDonald's hashbrown order but never get. My one gripe is that whenever I get a burger all the way, I really want coleslaw as well, so I was mildly disappointed that theirs doesn't have coleslaw. But since I can easily add it next time, I know it's gonna be outta this world. I've never been so excited about a burger place before.",

I opted for a regular cheese burger (ketchup and mayo) only and an order of fries.  The burger was juicy but otherwise no frills.  Their fries are wedge cut fries that were fresh and delicious.  A couple of things to note:  they are CASH only.  It is basically a walk up counter to order.  They do not have seating.  There is a large communal table under the protection of a pavilion.  Many were eating in their cars.  There is ample parking.  They are only open Mon-Fri until 3:00 pm.  All in all it was a cheap, quick lunch and I am glad I have finally dined at this local landmark; however, I do not see me having cravings for a Brooks burger.",

You can throw all of the expected dopey descriptors in their direction, should you feel so equipped to do so -- \"A True, American classic!\" \"The BEST burger in all of Charlotte!\" \"A real staple, by golly!\" ......whatever. Pick your favorite.   My take? It's the shining star in a sea of dying breeds for truckers, blue collar, and white collar alike. It's the kind of place, on the local level, that you want to have memories of. You need to experience a burger wrapped in paper and eaten at the dirty, standing room-only, picnic tables. You need to experience the \"line\" during the lunch rush. It's a timeless favorite.   Would you know about Brooks from reading some hip, haute cuisine magazine? Absolutely not. You're either going to stumble across the reviews and hear about how it's a stellar burger stop with great fries or your friend's grandma's church member's daughter used to go when she was a kid and you have to try it.   It's a dive and it's utterly perfect. My only regret is that I didn't get my burger all-the-way -- chili, onions, and mustard. That sounds like heaven.   Do yourself and everyone else a favor and go have your own experience at Brooks.",

    "text": "This. Place.  I can't believe I've lived in Charlotte for 5 years and somehow hadn't wandered over to Brooks'. It's perfect casual location for a take-out lunch with friends.  I looked on Yelp to make sure we were all talking about the same place. Greasy, happy food in paper bags-cash only. Yep, that's the one.  We arrived and I was immediately overcome with the aroma of sizzling beef. Vegetarian or not, you can't argue with that smell. It's divine.  One of my dining partners, a MD, is a regular, and I heard shouts of, \"Hey, Doc!\" and realized the owners have a personal relationship with their customers. Something I truly appreciate.  Having perused the menu ahead of time, I found that there aren't really any overt vegetarian options, but I didn't let that dampen my enthusiasm. I opted for an off-the-menu grilled cheese with tomato. No balking by the staff, and I think my sandwich was sublime. Coupled with fresh, nicely salted fries and a canned soft drink, it left nothing to be desired.  What I appreciated about the grilled cheese is that it was served on a hamburger bun, but was pressed almost like a cuban sandwich...so the edges were crisp and held up well to the potentially soggy tomato situation.  Once we received our orders, labeled in small paper bags, it was out to the covered, long, standing picnic table just outside the door. I love the communal dining aspect of the experience and the opportunity it afforded to enjoy a lunch while standing and chatting with my friends.  One of the twin brothers stepped outside to share a joke with our party. Super southern, super kind.   They're open for breakfast and lunch, Monday through Friday, and appear to have a large, fiercely loyal following. Apparently their chili is a big deal.   So go try Brooks'. Take along a few friends, a $20 and some TUMS.   You'll leave happy.",

    "text": "I've had Brooks bookmarked for quite some time after seeing it profiled on some Food Network or Travel Channel show on great burgers and finally found myself in the area and hungry.  The building is small and all orders are to go where you can eat them standing up at wooden tables outside if you want to stay on premises.  Not sure how long Brooks has been around but there was a sign inside thanking customers for 40 years of support.  Thing is, the sign looked like it had been there for 40 years so lets just say, they've had staying power!  It's a very limited menu with mainly burgers and dogs and they do serve breakfast sandwiches in the morning.  Liver mush and egg sammie anyone??  I got the burger I saw on the show which was a cheeseburger ATW which at Brooks means chili, mustard, slaw and chopped onions.  The burger was a fat patty of clearly fresh beef and the sandwich as a whole was outstanding.  Best burger ever?  No, I make those at home but, still damn good and really cheap.    This is clearly one of those local institution type joints and I have a special place in my heart for mom and for pop.  Am very glad I came to Brooks!",

The ONLY downfall to this place (which I can respect) is they are only daytime hours m-f.  You know you are about to get some decent food when you roll up to a cinderblock building and construction workers and uptown bankers are all gathered around outside to get one of Charlotte's best kept secrets.  There are no seats or bathrooms in this place, but there are stand up tables to eat outside.  Bring cash as cards are not accepted.  Oh, and my insider tip- double patty bacon cheese burger with a slab of fried bologna on top.  BOOM!  The chili burger is AMAZING too!",

    "text": "This place serves up an excellent burger, and equally excellent hot dog, and the FFs are no slouch either. This is a takeout only, hole in the wall place, kind of buried on a side street in a Charlotte neighborhood off North Davidson.  We tried 2 cheeseburgers ($3.50 each), one with L,T, & Mayo, and one ATW with M, C, & O. Both were out of sight good, but the ATW burger was a little better - as good a diner style burger as you're gonna find in the state - up there with PB's in Winston, Char-Grill in Raleigh, and Wimpy's in Durham.  The Hot Dog ($2.00) is also as good as it gets in a classic Southern Chili dog - great tasting, meaty chili, decent wiener, and a good bun. This is as good as Green's here in Charlotte, and just a smidge behind PB's. The FFs ($2) were very, very good. Will definitely try the Chili Cheese Fries next time (they go foe $3.75)  The have barbecue on the menu, but just in the fall, I was told. Darn!  These are world class burgers and hot dogs, and at these prices, they are beyond a value meal. Not coming back is not an option",

    "text": "I had wanted to try this place for a while as I've seen all the accolades for their food. I knew before hand about the restaurant being cash only, so that was okay. Between my boyfriend and myself, we got two burgers, a hotdog, and chili-cheese fries. My boyfriend described the chili as chopped pepper steak ... it looked like chopped meat and I did taste the spicy, peppery-ness of it, but it wasn't in a sauce or tomato based like I expect most chili to be. It was very tasty, nonetheless.  The burgers and hotdog were also good.   Food was an A+. The wait was a D-. Since the restaurant is only open from 7am to 3pm during the week (not open on weekdays), if you are going for lunch, you have to take time out of your workday.  For 4 food items, we waited almost 30 minutes.  I don't know if when we got there if the day was atypical or not, but they do note on their website that for call in orders, expect 20 to 25 minutes. There is no seating, so be prepared to stand.  I think the food was really good, maybe even better than other burger places in Charlotte, but given the long wait, it would probably be better to call in ahead of time and pick up your food so you don't have to wait as long standing outside.",

Keep in mind, its a shack with no proper ventilation so you would habe either wait in your car or outside (no sitting).

Not much to say that other reviewers haven't said so well.  Just go, and bask in the glow of a fried bologna sandwich with all the trimmings or a loaded chili burger.

    "text": "Please consider this an apology to all the vegetarians and vegans around the world...sorry...but...  I love bacon. Crispy bacon with the perfect amount of salt and crunch...but not too crunchy of course. Oh, and a touch of grease please. Now, I don't eat bacon too often but for some reason I had an insane hankering for a BLT the other day when I was driving around NoDa. And then the light bulb flickered in my little head...Brooks...Sandwich...House.   This unassuming little house is simple - a counter, a few friendly employees and cash only. I ordered my BLT, paid the $3 and change and went on my merry way. The bacon was cooked to perfection and the sandwich was the exact no frills option I was seeking. And hey, those breakfast sandwiches look pretty delightful, too.   Now I'll need to make my way back here (very soon) to dive into a burger...I hear they're fantastic...thanks, Brooks!",

Not only can I not believe I've never been here but I'm surprised that I'd never even heard of this place until recently (That statement makes me sound like I should know everything and I don't...not even close, but still.). As others have said, it's not a place that you will just casually pass by. You have to know where you're going to find it. Glad I did. I got the chili cheeseburger w/ fries and a Cheerwine. Not only tasty but filling. Yes, I would say they have some really good burgers but more importantly I would say that this is a place people have to experience just to say they did. It's a throw back to simpler times where you find extremely loyal customers clamoring to a local tradition. Consider me apart of that now!",

A friend brought me there to experience what he called a regular meal-stop over the course of 30 years, and so I could share it with my other half on his next visit- and we SHALL go here again!!! Service was friendly and social. Burgers were awesome. Atmosphere brought back fond memories of home- for those of you from the Hudson River Valley in NYS- think Red Rooster in Brewster, but BETTER, albeit no miniature golf! Brooks is basically a walk-up version of a drive-through, except the food is far better. No cardboard patty served on a cardboard bun here!!! Sides are great and the chili??  Oh.My.GAWD!

Burgers are great too!!   The interior is very small I have always taken my food to go, but they do have picnic tables outside. Do expect a crowd around early lunch time but not to worry the lines move quick! Only bummer about this place is the hours- wish they were open 24hrs just for those nights when you've been out drinking and all you really want is a Bacon Egg and Cheese!!!

The chili was absolutely divine. I mean so good that you could slather it on cardboard and it would taste delicious. The hot dog wasn't your typical North Carolina red dog (which I genuinely love). It was an elevated meaty dog with a nice rich, beefy, sausage flavor.   The cheeseburger was amazing. Again the chili was the star but the beef was clearly a fresh patty, the cheese was perfectly melted. It was amazing.   The fresh cut wedge fries were perfectly seasoned with seasoned salt and crispy.   All in all a deliciously craveable experience and that you won't regret.",

I ordered a side of chili cheese fries which disappointed me (at least for the size and the price ratio).   But as far the burgers go - they're bomb. Try them.",

They stop serving food at 2pm, and I have to pick my dog up from the SpayNeuter facility near by at 3, so I ventured out here as early as possible to treat my self. My first mistake was not bringing cash, my second mistake was not checking to see if they had an ATM inside the building. Instead, I walked to the entrance and read the sign on the door \"CASH ONLY\" - Oops! so I returned to my car defeated. No! I came all this way, I must eat this burger! So I went on an adventure through NoDa looking for an ATM which wasted 20 minutes!  For the record, They DO have an ATM inside.  So I get a burger and hot dog all the way, because that's what you do when you try a local favorite spot; you order the recommended specialties. I did ask to add slaw to my hot dog tho.. anyways... Sadly, despite all my effort - I was not blown away by anything about the food. Perhaps I shall return again and tweak my toppings a little. Maybe then I'll find what the hype is all about. But rest assured, I won't be in any hurry to return.",

Definitely a local delight based on its location, decor & size it's easily missed (looks like an abandoned building after hours).   This little gem produces some good eats and has a very basic menu but quick and friendly service. All burgers are made well done so no special orders but the burgers are delicious. I have an extreme sensitivity to sweets so I normally do not order sweet tea from any where but a customer told me it's a perfect balance of tea & sweet and by the old Gods and new (Game of Thrones reference ) it was delicious and I didn't need to dilute with water so thank you Brooks.  I highly recommend Brooks for anyone who can get there between the hours of 9am-2pm (they serve breakfast) but the grill shuts down promptly at 2pm so get there on time you won't be disappointed.  P.S. You get a little ticket after ordering, your pickup number is after the dash  & you pay when picking up the order not ordering.",

Not too many bells and whistles, just a simple, delicious burger. You can get a single or a double with many usual burger fixings such as onion, cheese, and bacon.  They are also known for their chili. You can get that by the pound or on top of your burger. Their burgers are tasty and decadent. Their fries are simple and good... not great, but they go well with the burger. They have other things like breakfast options, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches, but I can't bring myself to cheat on the burger with anything else. The set up is simple and the nostalgic. The staff are friendly and inviting.  If you have never tried them, do so now. The fryer turns of at 2 pm so, you don't have all day to get the full menu. They can be really busy at times and there is no dine in area. Be prepared to either eat at the outside picnic area, your car, back at home or your office. However, wherever you take it, you are going to enjoy it.",

I didn't taste anything that screamed best burger in Charlotte.  It's a decent burger.  Meat was moist.  Chili was hardly notable in the entire meal.  Especially shocking after everyone screamed how amazing it was.  Fries soggy and lacked flavor.  I can't fathom how this was voted best burger in all of Charlotte unless it just gets the hometown vote.  Service was quick.  Honestly, if you want to have a burger that truly tastes amazing there are several restaurants that will blow Brooks away.

If you consider the taste of their menu items and divide that by the price, you'll learn quickly that Brooks is one of the most valuable restaurants in Charlotte.

I got a single Patty with cheese, bacon, and the works. Delicious! Everything worked together to compliment each other, and the service was pretty fast. I was nervous that there would be a line out of the door, but I did go at 8 am (this place is perfect for my work schedule because I get off during breakfast time but never seem to want breakfast).  Rated individually:  Burger: 4/5 Fries: 2.5-3/5  The fries were my least favorite part of the meal just because I like medium to skinny fries. These fries were more like wedges, but they still got the job done.  I paid $8 for my burger and fries, which I think is pretty standard. I would definitely come here again!",

I love hole in the wall burger places and love to support local businesses, but this place does not deserve the hype.  The burger is not an actual patty, it's ground up meat that goes everywhere with little to no flavor or taste. I took a picture and it looked like something I found in a garbage. Not even worth showing, but trust me, save your $4.  The people working had as much personality as a mannequin. Pains me to say, but this place may be one of the most overrated in the Queen City.  You couldn't pay me to return.",

This is really a no frills hole in the wall place which I love.   We got their burger with cheese all the way (chili, onions, and mustard) which is what they're known for. We also tried a hot dog all the way and chili cheese fries. The burger was definitely my favorite. The hot dog was good, but you just can't top the burger. The fries were really good, the cheese was crispy and delicious.   This is definitely a must try in Charlotte. If I worked in the area, this would be a frequent lunch destination.",

I'm not a huge french fry person, so for me I order a burger with a side of chili dog. I do enjoy their fries though, they are more like potato wedges. You can also get them slathered in chili and cheese. There's a few other sandwich options like a BLT, livermush, bologna, fish filet, etc. You can get breakfast til 10:30am. There's also an option to order their chili and slaw by the pound.  There is no indoor seating. You order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. There's a few outdoor tables. If you're not down to sit outside, then plan to eat in your car (you'll see several people doing this) or take it to go.   Important things to note: they are open Monday through Friday 7am-3pm and closed on the weekends. They are cash only, but there is an ATM on the premises.",

I ordered the double cheese burger all the way, a hot dog all the way, as well, and fries.   The staff was awesome. They were fast, accurate, and friendly. With this being my first time I was unsure of where to stand while I waited for my order. I ended up holding up the wall by the ATM. In retrospect this wasn't a good idea because space is VERY limited inside.   It did not take very long before I received my food. It smelled wonderful. After a short drive home, it was time to partake. After unwrapping everything the burger and the hot dog looked delightfully messy. I tasted the burger first. It tasted a bit dry; even with the chili and mustard. Then I tried the hot dog. It was good but I wasn't wowed. Maybe my expectations were too high.  With this place being a Charlotte staple, definitely give them a try. My tastes aren't your tastes and this place has been around for a very long time. I think I will be back but this time I will try different toppings.",

Great selections of breakfast sandwiches and lunch sandwiches. You can also get can sodas and fries. During the morning they have hash browns as a side. I've visited this place for years. They are nestled in the corner of the North Davidson (NoDa) area of Charlotte. You order and can wait outside for your number to be called. The new light rail system is in walking distance along with other shops and restaurants. Brooks stands alone in a red brook building with the name Brooks on it.

If you're looking for a delicious messy burger, this is the place to go.   It's not hard to find, you just wouldn't think to look for it. They only take cash but they have an atm just inside the door. And they don't have seating. There's enough space inside for a handful of people to put in their orders then, you stand to eat outside. I believe there might be some benches but I didn't pay attention.   I will most likely return and tell my friends about it!",

    "text": "Finally  made it. Been on my \"to do\" list for years.  This place has always gotten excellent reviews on their Dogs, Burgers, and Sandwiches but I have never had an opportunity to try them. That is till today.  My problem is that they are only open 7 am to 3 pm, Monday through Friday and closed on weekends.  Not normally in Charlotte at these times and if I am, I'm on a tight schedule and with little reason to be in the same area as the restaurant.  Then we have today.  Had Hip Replacement Surgery on Wednesday and was discharged at around 1 pm. Elizabeth to NoDa is not that far so off we went.  Found out real quick there were some street closures and detours because of the Blue Line Lynx extension so pay attention and pay attention to signs.  Since I am on a walker and crutches, my wife went up to the window and ordered lunch. Not completely sure what she had but I had the Chili Dog and the Basic Cheeseburger.  Both were delicious.  The dog was plump and juicy and Chili full of meat and great flavor. By full of meat, I mean not as runny as most commercial chili you tend to get out of a can and they type that other dog places try to imitate  People like to think of a Gourmet Burger or Cheeseburger in terms of all the exotic things that can be added. They can be good but get away from what a Gourmet Cheeseburger Burger should be.  A Gourmet Cheeseburger should be as simple as possible with a good fresh pattie cooked properly and neither dry or greasy. Cheese should something that compliments the meat and does not distract, Then of course, you have you have the other topping of lettuce and tomatoes which should be a fresh as possible and tomatoes should be properly ripe. Bun should be fresh and condiments should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the simple tastes that each component contributes. Mayonnaise is good and a very mild mustard used sparingly are good choices.  Final potential topping is the onion. Some people like them, some don't. I like a slice of a good sweet onion to add a bit of texture to the burger so long as it's of the sweet type.  Brooks pulled it off.  The Chili Dog and the Cheeseburger were both worth their reputation and if I was to name a favorite, it would be the Cheeseburger.  Take note that the roads are messed up with Blue Line Extension but good news is that they are now only short walking distance to one of the stations",

    "text": "You know how long I've been wanting to try this place?!  LONG OVERDUE!  Finally I got to try the famous Brooks burger last week for lunch. My $3.50 cheeseburger all-the-way (onion, chili & mustard, I asked for slaw on top of it at no extra charge) was well worth every penny. The single pattie was grilled to a slight crisp on the outside but retained a good balance of juicy meat flavor with a hint of seasoning. Everything else added on made it a filling portion (at least for me). The menu board was short and sweet, the only side item was fries basically... which wasn't anything special.  The whole eating under the outdoor hut/shed structure standing up along a wood slab table with everyone added to the experience. There will be many Brooks lunch outing in the future... I may have to give other items a try.  Tips to eating at Brooks: 1.Don't wear white... or anything light color, especially if you doing all the way southern style. 2. Lettuce and tomato cost extra, but seriously, stick with chili and onion and slaw... you're in the South, enjoy the perk 3. May not be a bad idea to bring some wet naps 4. As you may know already, CASH only, so bring them",

Just a counter and great burgers served up Carolina style (chili, mustard, onions). The prices are amazing and you can't beat the taste. Don't worry about finding a seat because Brooks is take out only. There are some picnic areas to eat outside, but you will find many patrons taking in the great taste of the real Brooks brothers in their car. Don't miss one of Charlotte's best greasy landmarks.  Biggest tip is that it is cash only. If you didn't make a trip to the ATM machine, there is one in the ordering area.",

They have no where to sit, but they do have a table that you can stand up and eat at outside. Makes you feel like you're some sort of animal but I don't even care. I usually end up just eating in the car if it's particularly hot outside. Sweet tea is good. Don't even ask for unsweet tea.

Grab your cash (cash only) and make sure it's the middle of the afternoon on a weekday (limited operating hours) and call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait too long.   Brooks is a teeny tiny little spot - once you enter it almost reminds you of a under-the-tent church cookout or something along those lines. You will be squeezed in with a bunch of hungry patrons and be prepared to eat outside or take it to go as there is zero room to eat inside.   Now all of these stipulations to eating do not in fact make the experience more aggravating- in fact, it is quite the opposite. You can't help but feel the excitement in the air, and perhaps a bit of drool on your arm thanks to the guy smushed next to you. Regardless, your burger will be juicy, tasty, and cheap!  I recommend the cheeseburger all the way (onions, mustard, and chili)!",

I love that they shred their lettuce and onions so you never end up with one little thin slice of lettuce or a bite that only tastes like onion.

Bottom line is the food is out of sight. Southern style all the way. Get a burger and don't by any means miss the wedge fries served in their paper pocket with grains of salt clinging on. Ranks up there with the top 3 fries I've had, lots of flaky potato flavor to go along with you chili, mustard and slaw. Place your order, pay with cash and get out of the way and outside so you can cozy up next to lawyers, sanitation workers, hobos and railroad track gangs alike.

I found this out the hard way.....  - Seating: There are no seats inside or outside the restaurant. There are elevated communal wooden tables in the shade of trees.   - Parking: There is a generous amount of parking in their gravel lot.   - Conclusion: Their ATW burgers are SERIOUSLY good!   - PS: One time, after returning back to work, I took a ruler and measured the thickness of the hamburger patties, AFTER being cooked. One burger was fully one inch thick and the other burger was 7/8\" - amazing.   - PSS: Ordering their burger \"all the way,\" is the ONLY way to get the maximum goodness of mustard, chili, and onion atop their THICK, hand formed, never frozen, hamburger patties.   - PSSS: If Brooks would put CHILI CHEESE FRIES on their menu, they would make a fortune. Their fries are normally super crispy, skin on, and salty. Their homemade chili is out of this world. Top this with a liberal application of Velveeta  or Cheese Whiz melted cheese. You could sell these for $3 per container, as fast as you could make them.",

On the inside you'll find there's no seating, no \"real\" ordering line, no fancy decor, or anything else that resembles your average restaurant  Instead you walk in the front door and are immediately standing in the kitchen with only a counter between you and Brooks' World Famous Burgers.  After carefully considering what to get on our first trip and a little persuasion from the staff we decided to go for a bacon cheeseburger, a bacon cheeseburger \"all the way\", a hot dog \"all the way\", french fries, and a sweat tea. One of the things that Brooks' is best know for is their chili. Its pretty much considered an atrocity to dine at Brooks' without getting chili on something. Brooks' World Famous Chili is even being sold at your local Harris Teeter... that's how important this stuff is.   So after a few minutes of waiting and looking around, we realized just how much Brooks' reminded us of our favorite burger joint in Lynchburg \"Texas Inn\" aka the \"T\" Room. The rustic, authentic, local, anti-glamour type of foodie hangout that makes non-locals easy to point out. Then we got our food and headed outside to find out if Brooks' was all hype.. or whether or not locals had been on to something for the last few decades.  Brooks' lacks a lot of the creature comforts traditional to most restaurants but it doesn't seem to damper anybody's craving for their mouthwatering and handcrafted burgers. We walked outside and quickly realized we had four options  1- Bring the food home 2 - Eat in our car 3 - Eat on our car 4 - Eat at the long wooden table in the shade  It was an absolutely beautiful day so we chose to take full advantage of the quality lighting and setup on the hood of our super fancy Pontiac Grand Am.   To say the food looked too good to take pictures would be an understatement. All I could think of was how quickly I wanted to get the photos out of the way so my teeth could sink deep into the handcrafted and perfectly cooked hamburger patty topped with cheese, bacon, onions, chili, and mustard. Love at first bite is the best way to describe our experience at Brooks'. After a few minutes of the HOT.. HOT.. HOT sun beating down on us we sought out refuge in the shade and relocated our grub to the long wooden table behind the restaurant.  After consuming every last bite and taking a long hard look from an outsiders perspective of the restaurant and the claim of being \"Home of the World's Best Burger\"... we decided it fell a little shy of the high expectation we had at the beginning. It was love at first bite and we would definitely recommend it to any foodie looking to get a taste of Charlotte's history. But with that aside... it was not \"Home of the World's Best Burger\". Instead we found it to be home of a really good and fresh made piece of Charlotte burger bliss.",

    "text": "I'm kicking myself now that I found this place because I've been working in NoDa for 4 years and could've been eating these burgers all along...better late than never I guess!   I instantly fell in love with Brooks because I love Hole-in-the-wall type places and this is definitely one of those. From my experience, when you take away all the unnecessary frills, you are left with something delicious and cheap, and that is really all that matters in life. I've had their chicken sandwich, fries, and burgers, and the burgers are by far the star. I always get them with cheese all the way, which includes mustard, onions, and their homemade chili for $3.50. One of the things I love most about their burgers, other than the taste, is the fact that although they do pack a large amount of chili in there, it is not a complete disaster when you eat it and you can actually safely eat them while driving! (layer some napkins on your lap for extra insurance!)  It sucks that we can't eat their burgers 24/7, but I respect the fact that they're a family owned business and need to take some time for themselves.",

It is a tiny  walk up counter, pretty smoky from the exhaust.  Simple breakfast items, burgers and dogs. Everything is wrapped in that heavenly white paper.  No tables and chairs, only one long table outside. A very fun visit to fulfill the chowhound in you. Brooks is one of those special places that you need to go at least once.  Cash only, closes 2p in the afternoon.",

    "text": "A solid burger and fries at a decent price and nothing more here in my opinion.  I stopped in at around 11:30 hoping to be a little before the lunch rush (if there is any at Brooks- I'm not really sure), and I ordered the cheeseburger all the way combo with fries. I have to say that I was surprised at the location to begin with- I didn't expect a lot, but I didn't realize it's essentially a shack with no place to sit and eat (and barely enough space to stand in line). Despite only ordering a burger and fries, it took 8-10 minutes for the food to get done even though only 2 other orders were ahead of me, so I would recommend ordering ahead.  As for the burger, it was good but not great. It came with standard bun, pretty high quality beef patty, a slice of unheated American cheese, some chili, and LOTS of onions and mustard. I'm glad I really like mustard or it may have been too much, and the plethora of raw onions wasn't ideal but also wasn't bad. I would've prefer the onions grilled but they were still decent on the sandwich. The chili added no real flavor, however, and honestly I wouldn't have been able to distinguish it taste-wise from the beef patty. The single cheese slice was lost with all the onions and mustard and didn't provide much flavor either. Overall, it was a good, greasy burger for only $3.75 and was definitely a step up from fast food burgers. For a fairly long wait time (or the inconvenience of having to order ahead) I would probably rather go to a Five Guys and pay slightly more for a larger burger where I can get the toppings I want.",

    "text": "Small little hole-in-the-wall place that's right behind the Highland Mills Lofts in NoDa. No seating inside (there are some wooden tables outside to stand and eat) and CASH ONLY.   Had heard a lot about this place but never could find myself around the area when it was open until yesterday. There was a line when I came in around 12pm as well as people already eating outside. Ordered a cheeseburger all-the-way (chili, mustard, and onion) and added bacon with coleslaw. Since this was my first time and I wasn't sure when I'd be back, I splurged and ordered the chili cheese fries too.  The burger - delicious! I personally enjoy a burger the most when I feel like the patty is big enough to fill you (and the bun) up but not so big that you need to cut it in half. Was it nice and pretty? Definitely not but it tasted great. When I come back, I'll probably hold the bacon only because it added a salty taste which was good but took away from the flavoring of the burger, chili, mustard and slaw. Again, with the burger being a great size, the chili really complimented everything. It was barely messy at all and you could taste all the toppings.   Chili cheese fries - they were good, not great. Lots of grease from the chili and cheese which was expected. I could barely see any cheese on the fries though. If their chili wasn't so great, I would have probably docked a star but I would have been happy with just chili on the fries. I'm glad I got to experience first-hand how great this burger place does chili :)   I'm definitely coming back!",
