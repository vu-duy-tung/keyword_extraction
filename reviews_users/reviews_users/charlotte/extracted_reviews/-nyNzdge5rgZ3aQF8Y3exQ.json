    "text": "Wow.  I'm still surprised at how little transplants and visitors to Charlotte know about food.  Following stints living in San Francisco, Atlanta, Dallas and even Indianapolis, as well as frequent travels all over the US on both my own dime and my employer's (and a lot of cooking cuisine at home from around the world), I've found Yelp less useful for upfront reconnaissance here than anywhere else I have traveled or lived for precisely this reason.  After 2 years here, the overabundance of petty complaints and unfair assessments never ceases to amaze me.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but when a review starts with \"I've never had ____ food before, but this was awful...\", \"I get Thai 'cause I love spice...\" or \"I don't know anything about ___food...\" , that should tell the reader to scroll down.  But I digress.  This location of Thai Taste benefits from a small, cozy interior, comfortable outdoor seating and gracious service from both the staff and owner.  More importantly, the food is authentic (yes, Americanized, but not unduly so given its location), the ingredients are fresh and the menu is focused but complete.  You won't find the amateur-night, calling-it-in Thai flaws of oily beef, overcooked chicken, overused fish sauce, cornstarch sauces or gristle/gristle/gristle here. Just straightforward Thai cooking the way it should be served in most cities in the US.  Take a look at my other reviews for spots YOU also like before you take my word for it, though.  AND...peel back the onion of the reviewers who assigned few stars here - and anywhere else you're thinking of visiting.",

However, the last two times we went (it has been a while, hesitant to go back) we had lower quality food.  First, my husband bit on a plastic disk found in a mouthful of rice. When we told the manager (we had been there several times and she recognized us) she simply claimed that happens and made no reparations. The next time the chicken was tough and rubbery in the curry.  She blamed her cook who she said was Hispanic and therefore didn't know how to make Thai?  Think I will either make the trek to East for consistently good food and service or hit the local Thai in Blakeney for a quick bite.",

I frequently (once every 2 weeks at least) eat Thai food but I usually get the same few dishes.  I LOVE Pad Thai and Thai Taste has the best I have ever had.  I love the lunch special because for under $10 you get soup, one of the lunch specials (Pad Thai is always on the menu), and a spring roll.    I have also tried the Pad See Ew, Spring Roll appetizer, and several different hot pots of soup.  I have never had a problem with the service here.  The food, drinks, refills, and check delivery have always been quick.  I will continue to frequent Thai Taste any time I visit my parents/friends in Charlotte.",

I recently visited the Matthews location (across from Beantown Tavern and the public library) and I was filled and fulfilled with what I ate.  My friend and I began with the spring rolls. crispy and not saturated in oil.  Our waitress explained the different lunch specials and combinations of meats (4 meats and tofu) and curries (three of varying heat).  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special.  Unlike sesame chicken at Chinese restaurants, the sauce was not at all heavy and sweetened beyond recognition.  The chicken was white meat and lightly fried, covered with a spicy, sweet sauce and fresh broccoli florets, served with a large bowl of clumpy white rice.  I sipped on hot jasmine tea from a small kettle, which the waitress replaced twice and offered a third refill.  Who does that?  For $14, I think is a great place to get a \"catch up\" meal with a friend.  If you eat too much, you can always walk it off in downtown Matthews.  Kudos, Thai Taste!",

I asked for peanut sauce with my appetizer, which I've had before, but there was clearly something wrong with it. When I opened the container, it was congealed and looked really gross. I tried mixing it but nothing helped. When I turned the container upside down, it didn't even come out; it just stayed stuck to the bottom. I called the restaurant to let them know but they told me I needed to heat it up. I've never done this before but I decided to try it anyway. I will attach some pictures to show you what it looked like after I heated it up. I called the restaurant back and they were extremely rude and insisted there was nothing wrong with it. They basically told me that the next time I order my appetizer, just to take the sauce that comes with it instead of asking for the peanut sauce. Terrible food and awful customer service. Do not eat at this restaurant!!",

The way they cooked the egg is the way I would cook the egg for this dish or for Pad Thai or any stir-fried dish!  This was the best meal I have eaten at Thai Taste (the last one was shortly after they opened this location years ago).  The Pad Kee Mow carries the stars (4 yelp stars) for this dine!  The service was good though I usually do not add or subtract stars or even fractions of stars for service good or bad!  So good service does not increase their rating though the rest of the food could bring the rating down, I'm over looking it this time!  The Chicken Satay was A-OK close to 3 yelp stars.  The Peanut Sauce was better than most, though not as good as the best ones - 3.2 stars.  This means I would not order it again.   The soup and the spring roll were included in the meal and would NOT get 3 stars, maybe two, though I do not let \"throw-away\" items effect the overall rating of the meal most of the time including today!  Great Dinning Room, almost a Sun-room.  Glass around three sides shows off the outdoor patio! The Decor is Simple, not gaudy!  I like both Simple and gaudy, though I prefer Simple!  If I were giving stars for how the place looked I would say this place has potential and the stars would not effect today's dine rating!  Usually the way a place looks does not effect my yelp rating.",

    "text": "Practically born and raised in Thai restaurants because my family owns several in Chicago and Thailand  -- I hope that means something when I say I will never go back to this place. Worst Thai food ever. Sometimes when I walk into a place they immediately wonder if I am Thai and ask me if I want \"authentic Thai\".  Isn't that what I am here for?  Immediately I recognize that I might not have always have a good meal if I frequent the restaurant.  I walked in to Thai Taste and got several looks and stares but none of the owners or wait staff ever asked me.  I figure that this place has been around for years and it's busy so it must be decent, right?    This place just serves whatever they throw on a plate and calls it Thai food, maybe that's why the restaurant is called \"Taste of Thai\" because it sure don't taste like it!  I would be much happier eating Chinese and I don't even like Chinese food.  Just because it's the first restaurant of its kind in the area, does not mean that it's the best or any good.    So enough of my ranting.  Here's some useful information - our table had Satay, Mee Krob, Tod Mon Pla,  Panang, Pad Gra Pow, Pad Thai, and their \"specialty\" Thai Taste Fried Rice.  You know...basic Thai food that most Thais know how to cook. The equivalent difficulty in cooking a few of these dishes would be chicken wings, spaghetti, and beef stew.  I tasted everything (I chuckle now when I say \"taste\" simply because of the name of this restaurant) and did not enjoy a single thing. The meat was either dry or tough, the flavor was either lacking in one dish or foul in another.  It also seemed like the cook was trying to be \"creative\" but ended up tasting (haha, there's that word again) like a disaster.  This place is busy and I have heard good things about it from locals.  I have also heard that before this place opened, no one really has had Thai food before.  My experience with people and Asian food, actually food in general in NC, is that people don't know the difference or don't know any better. So readers....here is my recommendation - skip Thai Taste and go to Thai 1st Bistro @ Blakeney and get yourself some decent Thai food!  It's worth the drive.  A message to the Thai Taste owners: stick with simple basic Thai cooking.  Stay True to the flavors and ingredients of Thai food by keeping it authentic.",

Did not notice the sign that read \"The oldest Thai restaurant in Charlotte\" until leaving, but that was a good indication of longevity and the quality of their food.  Now the Matthew's location is pretty new - the staff is super friendly and the dining room is ultra clean.  Our food came out rather fast after ordering (a good thing!).  I had the \"C-2\" curry with chicken and it was delicious.  The amount of rice served with the dish was perfect..... I always have trouble with my rice to mean/sauce ratio.  I got a \"3\" heat for the spiciness and by the end of the meal, my mouth was good and warm - just the right amount.",

There are few options in Matthews-Mint Hill for Thai food, so Thai Taste Matthews serves to fill that void. A unique corner space in Matthews Station across from Town Hall, Thai taste is elegantly decorated and staffed by warm, welcoming employees.  For lunch, they are fantastic. A variety of menu items that arrive well executed. I find their lunch portions to be just the right size, too: not so small you find yourself snacking but not so egregiously large that you need a mid-afternoon nap. I'm not the biggest fan of heat, so you order your spice level using 1-5. Two is usually where I fall, especially if it's in a coconut sauce with a slight sweetness to cut the heat. Friends who are into hot and spicy are happy with a 3.  Dinner, on the other hand, has not been as kind to me. The prices are noticeably higher for many of the same dishes and the quality seems to lag. Maybe I've just been on bad nights, but it has happened more than once and worthy of noting.  For a quick Thai fix, especially when the mood strikes midday, Thai Taste will certainly fit the bill if you are in Matthews.",

It was a beautiful day and their were flowers decorating the outside area.  It was the perfect place to enjoy my food.  I ordered the Massaman curry and it was superb.  It was perfectly creamy and wasn't overly coconut-flavored.  The crunchy peanuts on top were the perfect complement to the generous portion of carrots and chicken in my dish.  It had a little bit of sweet, a hint of fruit, a tad bit of spicy, and a whole lot of flavor.  It's hard to describe it very well, but I think the word umami fits is perfectly.  It was so savory and delicious.  If there is any one small thing I was disappointed in, it'd be the level of spiciness.  I told my server I really like spice and asked for a little bit of heat, so he recommended a 3 out of 5 level of heat.  I barely got any heat in my 3, so I was a little let down there.  Next time I order there, (and I WILL definitely order there again), I will definitely try a 4!",

Somehow we managed to choke down a couple bites before calling over the server to have her take it away! It tasted like spoiled spaghetti--very tomatoey...after taking our still full plates, another person came over (we assumed was the manager) & told us we'd still have to pay because \"everyone loves their Pad Thai & nothing was wrong with it\".

In itself not a big deal but overcooked needle thin noodles, no ground peanuts, hardly any sprouts ... it was bland bland bland, had no flavor whatsoever other than...salt and sweetener, as in high fructose corn syrup.

The spring roll wasn't on the online menu so I figured $10.95 plus $2.  My meal was $16 and change.  I get home and I have 4 spring rolls with my meal.  My meal was bland.  It had a nice serving of veggies but not enough seasoning.  Back home they give a 16oz of highly seasoned and creamy green curry with thick pieces of bamboo shoots, green & red peppers.

    "text": "I met family here for dinner and was generally underwhelmed. Our party of five was seated quickly as we arrived on the earlier side of dinner.  The restaurant did fill up near the end of our meal though so consider dining early to avoid the wait.  We were asked for drink orders quickly, but it took some time for the drinks to arrive and actually place the order. I ordered a beer, but it never came.  By the time the sever remembered I was nearly finished with dinner so I didn't want it. Luckily, she remembered to remove it from the bill.   We split an appetizer of mi krop crispy noodles. This is a fun dish when it is prepared well - crispy, sweet from tamarind, and complimented by chicken, tofu, or other protein. Unfortunately, this version was dry and the little pieces of chicken were hard and basically inedible.   For the main course, my family ordered a mix of noodle, curry, and stir fried dishes. The food seemed to arrive as ready, which is good for temperature but one member of our party had to wait while others started. My mom ordered the pad thai and said it was really dry and extremely spicy for a medium order. She actually didn't eat very much, which was a bummer as I love nothing more than to treat my mom to a fantastic dinner. My sister was about half way through her panang curry when she found a hair in her meal. She was pretty grossed out!   The stir fry dishes were fine. Nothing great or horrible, except everyone seemed to find them very salty.",

Next we ordered the pad see ew and the pad gra prow.  The pad see ew was the better of the two, but was watery, the vegetables were still cold (soppy, possibly frozen), and was bland.  The pad gra prow (also known as Thai basil) was a disgrace to all thai food.  First off, it should be served with ground meat, and BASIL!  It looked exactly like the pad see ew (minus the noodles). Same frozen, soppy, vegetables, cheap chunks of meat and no flavor!  Wow, what a disappointment.",

Now firstly, the service was surprisingly commendable given I didn't expect much after I was told on the phone while ordering that I couldn't be told the total because they were busy. In restaurant, I was given my take out order quickly. That was perhaps aided by the fact I was wearing my work uniform complete with a name tag. Still it was good. The server was cordial and I have nothing at all to add that could have made me more comfortable.  On to the food! This was my first exposure to Thai food so I really don't have much of a basis for comparison. But you have to start somewhere and for me that somewhere was the most famous dish out there: Pud Thai. It was more flavorful than I expected as I'd always heard Thai cuisine placed an emphasis on balance. With the added sweet and spicy sauce however the only balance this dish had was the balance between delicious and tasty.",

Instead of unsweetened tea and a pitcher and a squeeze bottle of sugar syrup, they simply have sweet tea. Fewer condiments on the table.

The lunch specials \"menu card\" is the same with the same prices, but I found the Pad Thai with Chicken a little hotter (two star fresh here is equivalent to three star fresh in South End) and it was mixed up differently. Slightly different flavor and texture. Not better, not worse. Just different.",

This was the place I had Thai food for the first time and honestly I have not found a place I liked better since at the many other Thai places I have tried. The servers have always been friendly and still remember me even though I'm only able to come in when I'm in town. The food has always been delicious-- some favorites are pad see ew, massaman curry, and sesame chicken. Their sesame chicken is unparalleled and unique in its crispiness. Some other reviewers complained about the small lunch menu, but usually they are willing to make me something else if I ask for it.",

I was excited to try something new and was not disappointed! Here I ordered a red curry with chicken and pineapple. It was in the top 5 best meals of my life! It was so creamy and appetizing. At first it seemed like a small portion but after mixing bites with the jasmine rice I ended up having plenty of leftovers.   I loved the food so much I immediately went home and looked up a similar recipe I could make on my own. In no way does it compare but I was so happy to find a new food I loved so much.  The parking was easy enough. Inside was nice and low lighting for the evening.",

The Green Papaya salad was pathetic, it came with a wedge of brown iceberg lettuce, and it did not have Tofu.  It was very wet, seemingly like it was made earlier in day. The Tom Yum Soup ( which I specified Vegan broth) tasted like it was hot water with Kefir lime leaf in it and 2 pieces of dead tofu and barely any veg.  The sticky rice was not bad.

That isn't an issue because I love Thai foods, but it didn't give me a big wow factor. The service was prompt and friendly with a rather large staff which I just have to assume is family-based or closely associated. While they provided all the necessities and worked efficiently and diligently, there wasn't a feeling of pushiness.  The location itself felt like a nice neighborhood and the atmosphere is quiet and pleasant.  The food, as I said earlier, was decent and had good flavor. My only complain would be the amount of peanuts in the papaya salad.  The pad see yew was good with the traditional broccoli and egg flavors but it seemed to lack a strong noodle base.  The pork stir fry was good but it didn't really come with enough rice.  For me, each of these complaints are very minor issues as I think of myself as a bit more particular than the average person.",

Although,my favorite has to be the Gaeng Kua Curry with the pineapples. Chicken, Shrimp etc... all are great in the curries however, the ROASTED CRISPY DUCK really just stands out above them all. I have had duck many times at other Thai restaurants. I thought it was good at those, this doesn't even compare its so much better. Its heavenly. The roasted skin stays crispy the entire time its in the curry, while the inside is still super  tender. I cannot even express accurately how amazing this dish is. I was inspired to write haiku's about it after trying it for the first time. So good it inspires poetry! I find the portion sizes to be prefect, the ingredients are super fresh and the dishes have a good amount of spice heat to them. Although, i could very easily go wayyyy beyond the 5 rating.  The service is always very prompt and friendly. I'd also say the prices are very reasonable for the quality of dishes served. When food is this good i've got no problem shelling out the dough.",

    "text": "I am surprised that this place hasn't been reviewed by any yelpers. The decor is nice  and has plenty of seatings. We ordered some fried tofu, and spring rolls as starters and they were really good. For the meal, we got green curry, pad Thai, drunken noodles and some fried rice. Everything tasted really good, and the spice level was perfect. I ordered my drunken noodles spicy and they actually came spicy, not just hot like some other Thai restaurants do. Service was good as well, our server was polite and attentive and made us feel welcome. Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone.",

    "text": "Thai Taste is my husband and my favorite restaurant.  We always look forward to Friday night Thai food, and we let Wan-Pen tell us what's good each time we visit.  She never lets us down!  We've eaten at all the Thai restaurants in South Charlotte, and this is our favorite!  Fresh tasting, spicy hot dishes with Thai beer - doesn't get much better.  The staff is very friendly.  I disagree with the reviewer who said there are no lunch specials because there ARE!  Our favorite dish is the red or green curry with chicken, \"drunken noodles\" and the fish special with basil sauce.  Appetizers are yummy too (chicken satay and spring rolls and dumplings, oh my!)",

We have eaten here before, and the food is usually good, but after tonight's experience we won't be going back.",
