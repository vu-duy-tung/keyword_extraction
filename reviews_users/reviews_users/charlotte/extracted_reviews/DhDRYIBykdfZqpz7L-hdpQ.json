Once we sat down and was greeted by our server (which in turn, turned out to be one of the owners, a sense of comfort and eagerness was our next emotion. The food was great, our drinks were great and customer service was even better. I read some of the other negative reviews and it's sad people can be so critical or harsh of a new local owned restaurant that is really trying to put their stamp down. I did notice the young servers but I also saw them trying hard to please customers. I think it's awesome they give teenagers a place to work and GROW. The owner was very involved and even working with the rest of her team. (This you barely see.) of course they have some kinks to work out, but I will definitely return and I'm telling all my friends to come. Prices were ok but as soon as I got my food it was well worth it.",

I had salmon, grilled asparagus and smoked sweet potato which was delicious, not overly sweet.  They had a jazz duo  that started playing at 8:30pm.  This was a Saturday.  The restaurant allowed us to bring our own birthday cake.  They brought it out with candles and the jazz duo played the happy birthday song.  Very nice. Our wait person was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The owner was very personable.  Only drawback was their timing.  I ordered an appetizer which was delivered at the same time as the meals.  They were also a little slow with the meal deliveries.  But, that was the only drawback - not enough to keep me from coming back.  Definitely recommend.  Small restaurant with nice atmosphere.",

The shrimp were light and crispy. The egg rolls and sauce were delightful.  I wanted to take a bag home with me of the chips that came with the spinach/artichoke dip. And although I don't care for crab cakes I do know that a good one should be mostly crab, little filler and that's what the ladies that did order marveled about. We all couldn't get over the sweet tea and the lemonade. There were so many other apps I wanted to try plus I haven't even gotten to the entrees. I do wish they were a little closer to Charlotte but I won't let that stop me from coming again and again. Definitely on one of their live music nights!",

They rival Baltimore but the firecracker sauce puts them over the top.  We asked for extra firecracker sauce and we put that s@&! on everything.  For starters we had the Spinach dip awesome just spinach, good cheese and handmade chips.   My son who we had to drag in had what else; chicken fingers, which were not your standard \"kids chicken fingers\" these were freshly made, hand battered, crispy home made goodness.  Clearly this place takes pride in what comes out of the kitchen.   Which is rare to find in Charlotte.. well done Bella glad you chose Matthews to hang your shingle.  My only compliant would be the wine pours which were a little light.  Come on people \"give and you shall receive\"....Can I get Amen.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place today, it opened in October. It's a small, casual family owned restaurant, clean and more importantly the food is delicious, simple, very tasty it's got that homelike feel good food with some southern love. The menu has a small selection of items which I loved, all the options were well detailed and sounded very appetizing (there is something about those 3 page menus at the big chain restaurants that make me feel uneasy about how much food is sitting in their freezers and for how long).  We learned from the owner that they change up the menu every so often to keep it interesting. We ordered the Fire cracker Shrimp it was delicious just spicy enough. My husband ordered the Crab cake diner and it was full of real crab meat well seasoned no fillers and my recent favorite the delicious Fried Broccoli was so good it brought me back memories of my mothers cooking.  The service was great and the attention was very friendly I highly suggest you try this restaurant and support our local business owners, take a break from those big chain restaurants and their never ending never changing menus. Oh btw the owners mentioned the have some live music their schedules are available in Fb...got to find them",

    "text": "I truly do not understand how this establishment has 4.5 stars.  I can only assume that they are very old reviews and the place has since gone downhill.  My husband and I decided to come here for dinner based upon the 4.5 stars on Yelp on a recent Friday night.  We couldn't quite figure out what this place was supposed to be.  The decor and atmosphere is all over the place.  They have a dry erase whiteboard outside with daily drink specials and when you walk in, there is a bar with a tv to the left (giving the place a sports bar type vibe) but when you are greeted by the hostess they lead you back into the dining room which is decorated with more a lounge feel.  The service was friendly, but seemed extremely disorganized.  At one point while we were waiting for our server to get our drinks, another server came to our table and asked us if we had gotten served yet, it was very strange.  We ordered an appetizer of the Turkey ribs, which were very good. Again, the weird disorganization, we were given tea cup saucers as our appetizer plates, they weren't quite large enough for the ribs.  It just made it awkward to eat.  We went to order our entree's and there was another awkward moment.  They have two sides to their bifold menu, the menu on the left has a Lunch Plates title, the menu on the right has a Dinner Plates title.  Generally, when you have food being served during a specific time, it's mentioned somewhere on the menu, to let you know.  Literally, every single restaurant I've ever been to, if they have a specific time frame for certain menu items, it's mentioned, usually in bold type under the title.  Not here.  So when I went to order the Belle Burger, I was told that is only served at lunch (however, they don't specify exactly what time that is).  So, we took a few more minutes to make our selection.  There wasn't really anything on the dinner menu that interested me, so my husband got the chicken and waffles and I ordered a side of parmesan truffle fries (figuring we'd split his entree and my fries).  When our food came out, it was only his chicken and waffles that were delivered to our table, no fries.  Our server never came to our table after taking our order so we couldn't even ask about where my fries might be.  We started in on the chicken and waffles. I can deal with disorganized or slow service, I can deal with awkward moments, but only if the food is phenomenal.  This food was not even close.  The waffle tasted old.  It wasn't crisp on the outside and cakey on the inside.  It was chewy, tough, and flavorless.  We tried dipping it in the maple caramel dipping sauce to try to moisten it up a bit, but even the sauce was bland (it didn't even taste sweet, which was so weird).  The fried chicken was dry, and seemed overcooked.  The saving grace on the chicken was the gorgonzola sauce.  It at least imparted some flavor.  We didn't even finish the waffle nor the chicken.  We put our utensils and napkins on top of the plate to indicate we were done.  We probably sat there like that for 10 minutes, until I finally caught the eye of one of the servers (not ours, but I wasn't picky at this point) and said we'd like to get our check.  She asked me who our server was and we told her, and she said she would find her.  So we sat for a few more minutes.  At this point, my husband could not stop laughing at the absurdity of our situation.  So, we finally see our server come out of the kitchen door with food in her hands, she sees us, and immediately goes back into the kitchen. A few minutes later she comes out with a small bowl of fries and tries to give it to us.  I tell her I no longer want it as we were finished eating, and we are just looking for our check.  She then tells me \"They didn't tell you how long the fries would take so I'm sorry for that\".  It's nice that she's apologizing, but it seemed weird to me that fries would take longer to cook than fried chicken and a waffle, especially since we ordered them at the same time.  Also, she is the one that took my order, so I'm not sure if she meant that someone else was supposed to come to my table and tell me that the fires would take 3 times as long as an entree.  We finally got our check, paid, and got out of there.  We ended up going to another restaurant since this one had been so disappointing.  All in all, I would say our experience here was not a 4.5 stars experience, but that's how it works sometimes.  Maybe the night we went was a fluke, but we won't be back to find out.",

    "text": "Came here with a group for Black Restaurant Week. It's a hidden gem in a shopping center in Matthews. They had live music tonight to kick off Black Restaurant Week and they usually have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a fully stocked bar and the cocktails are super cheap. $6 for a Cosmo, you can't beat that. They offer lunch and dinner and they have a lot of different food options. I'm giving them 3 stars because the dish that I had was okay and becuase of the obvious markup of certain prices on their menu for Black Restaurant week. I started off with the fried broccoli. This was delicious, the batter is tempura like and it's served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce. The broccoli was very crisp on the inside of the batter and not mushy. The appetizer was great so I was expecting great things with the main dish and I was a bit disappointed. I ordered their signature chicken and waffle. The resents ton of the dish was great. The waffle was good, not too sweet and it was crispy on the outside like I like it. The chicken wasn't seasoned well. The outside of the beast was seasoned, but not the middle of the chicken. So you can taste the flavor only is you had some of the breading in your bite. If the chicken itself had been well seasoned, this would be an outstanding dish. Now on to the menu. We all know that it's no secret that sometimes restaurants may mark up prices for a special or a special week. My hangup is that it was so obvious. We received a Black Restaurant Week Menu and we received a regualr menu as well. Some items on the Black Restaurant Week menu had higher prices than the regular menu. The markup could've been anywhere from $.45 to $2. So this did turn me off a bit but not completely. The service was good and my app was good. I will be back to try some other things on the menu. My friend had the turkey ribs and she said they were good.",

When I got there I waited like 10 mins for my food , mind you I only order 2 things.. fried broccoli and Cajun chicken rolls .. so I paid and waited and waited thankfully a band was playing so I just mellowed out to their music which was a nice touch. So I got my food came home and everything was savory and delicious the sweet Thai chilly sauce was the bomb , the special seasoning for the chicken was finger licking good. The broccoli was yummy too but my only complaint on the food was the texture, for fried food both were soggy got me wondering why I waited I thought my food would be like crispy maybe they were firing it on the spot or like did they put it in the microwave idk ; they seemed a little busy a little , for a Friday night bar was full and they had a few guest sitting , everyone seemed to be taken care of with drinks and food so maybe it was just me who got the shorter end of the stick",

We started with the spinach dip which was the best I've ever had. The we ordered the chicken and waffles, the pork chops, and the shrimp alfredo. While I refused to share my chicken and waffles, I stole a fork full of the shrimp alfredo. I'm not a huge pasta guy, but that had to have been the best ever.

The team has a great work ethic and they are all so nice. We have been a few times and LOVE the fried broccoli appetizer and the salmon. Chicken and waffles are also yummy. They get fun music acts in to play and do a great job of engaging local community and entrepreneurs. They often have events going so check their Facebook page regularly. We have always felt welcomed.",

Served with sweet potato casserole and fresh sauteed veggies...the sides were also very good.   We glanced over at a plate of chicken fingers at another table...it was HUGE!  We ended the meal with homemade apple pie and ice cream.  All in all, a very satisfying meal and great service too!",

They both came with truffle fries which are wonderfully good with a dusting of Parmesan cheese. The shrimp and fish were both fried crispy and were not the least bit greasy. The shrimp came with a spicy dip; very delicious and the fish came with a homemade tartar sauce. Service was great and I can't wait to go back and try more of the different dishes offered. The fried broccoli is offered as a side or a starter and I want to definitely try it next. I highly recommend this neighborhood grill & restaurant and will be our next girls night out.

So, I took them and made a commitment to come to this little place that I'd had my eye on for quite some time. Little did my friends know, they didn't have a choice in the matter.  So, we stopped by before heading to a party. Everyone was so sweet and gracious, which already had me sold. The space is a little small but I feel like the tables are well-spaced. We happened to go on a night where there was a live saxophonist and it really added to the ambiance, along with the guest performer who belted out a tune or two (come to find out, she was also a patron lol). The food was awesome! Very well seasoned, but not salty. The chicken was tender (which surprised me, because I'm not a fan of breast due to the dryness), and the portions are plentiful. All three of us had enough for leftovers the next day.  I forgot to mention, we were also celebrating a birthday! The sax player played the Birthday song for our table and Chef Rob took extra special care in making my friend a birthday treat. It was beautiful and delicious!  All in all, I'd definitely go back. Rumor has it that the brunch is great.",

The highlight of the evening was this very talented band who I had seen performing before at Hickory Tavern.  A singer and a guitar player with a wide range of songs that made the experience worth it. Phenomenal vocalist.  The staff however was inattentive. I had to keep flagging them down for refills and other needs.   The diners in attendance were not friendly,  going out their way to avoid eye contact which made the experience more unsettling..

    "text": "Very disappointing- again. I wanted to go back for the broccoli but tonight it was cold and not brought right out of the kitchen. We ordered the sampler with the chicken, shrimp and broccoli and the chicken was the only hot item on the platter- manager came to ask about it and we told him that a couple items were cold but he never came back or seemed to care to fix or be accommodating at all. Also, none of the accompanying sauces came with the platter as advertised. Had to ask for them. And one arrived after the platter had been removed- really?? Ordered wine, which were the smallest glass pours of wine I have ever seen in a restaurant. I usually have 1 glass of wine at a restaurant which lasts me through apps and dinner- tonight I ordered 2 before dinner even arrived. Tried to order a third but it didn't arrive before I finished so I had to cancel it altogether. Waitress assured us manager would come over and speak 3 times but he was too busy socializing to worry about his other patrons. Needless to say, we will NEVER be back- marking this place off our list. And we were charged for that third glass of wine on our bill that never came to the table for dinner- total BS - don't waste your time or money on this place",

Upon recommendation, we started with the fried broccoli and the Berry Henny cocktail. Both were absolutely delicious. For the entrees, we had the Belle Alfredo (based on the recommendation of the manager) and the crab cakes. The Alfredo had blackened chicken and shrimp, and overall the entire dish was seasoned perfectly. My SO doesn't even like pasta and kept stealing bites from my plate. The crab cakes were moist and delicious and I will be back to eat an entire plate of that on my own. Please note that it is a small restaurant with max capacity at 66, so if you need to wait a little, you won't regret it!",

And because you are in a strip center, you have plenty of parking.  We tried the Belle sampler for our appetizer and each sample was tasty. The chicken a'liege (chicken and waffles) was really good.  Though the ribeye was flavorful, it was a bit grisley... would make a different choice next time.  But the ice cream-topped homemade apple pie was truly wonderful. This is a family-owned business. I hope you give them a try, I am certain you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I found this restaurant on Yelp when I typed in \"good food\" while using my current location in Matthews. I cannot believe what a hidden gem this place is!! First the cons ~ The location is in a strip mall and while that's lacking in appeal and initial perception...don't let that fool you for the cuisine they offer!!! The other lacking feature you'll notice when you enter is the huge bar that takes up more space than necessary. The internal decor is family style so don't expect plush seats and fancy interior designs. The pros ~ Exceptional customer service from entry to exit you'll not want to leave. Food is ready in minutes so if you go when you're hungry you won't feel starved before your food comes out. Food is tasty, seasoned well and is piping hot upon delivery. The turkey wings are soft, falls off the bone and is a pleasant option to find on a menu. The absolute best part of this restaurant is it's Friday karaoke night and live entertainment on Saturdays. A rarity in the South Charlotte restaurant landscape.",

    "text": "My first experience here and I was pleasantly surprised. One of my prior coworker's from NY had posted the last week she was going here and I asked how is this place?  From what I saw online the pics looked awesome.  She suggested we make plans for lunch.   The interior is exactly what I was anticipated, but I liked there was an out front eating area too.   The crab cake appetizer was spot on. Love mine not over cooked and not dry. Only thing I would do next time is ask for more of the sauce, it was scrumptious!  Even drizzled it over the veggies too, I'm old school and remember mom saying eat your veggies. Well I did .   My friend had these amazing broccoli that was nothing like I've had before. They seemed to be fried (not  sure) they had a chili sauce drizzled on them that I was mmmm so good.   Next for the entree, my friend is vegan and they made what I want to say is a special for her, I would just check prior to going to see if they can address your dietary needs as I tell people you should check ahead of time. All I can say she what is in-front of her was not all of it. She had another veggie medley. It looked like something I would settle for too if it wasn't I wanted one of the good southern meals I was hoping to taste.   To many choices but I've been drooling for some for a good chicken and waffle meal. I didn't need more than that to eat trust me!  The waffle was cooked to just the right texture to be able to hold the chicken and the maple syrup without getting that awful sogginess. The chicken I was just as I hoped! Thus the reason for 5 stars!  The chicken was crispy on the outside with the right crunch and the inside had that wow factor, which most chefs miss because they focus on the outside but not on the inside. It was juicy and moist, not over cooked or under cooked, both I so do not accept for chicken and make me not go patronize a establishment again. This place was spot on with all the food. I also hate, yes hate those who  go heavy handed on salt and pepper. There are hundreds of other spices and herbs to use while preparing foods and sadly, many places think that is the way to go.   Yes I love cooking and have helped Mom since I was 4-5 yrs old and majored in Home ec in high school and yes is still cook for people to this day, sorry I'm Italian Mom always said have food or staples in the house for unexpected visitors.   So if you're in the area, stop in and be pleasantly surprised and bring an appetite. Oh and they have jazz night so make sure to call and find out the dates.",

    "text": "Me and a friend had lunch at this little place today.  It was 12:30 on a Saturday and nobody else was there I was kinda surprised.  I had found it on yelp and added to my bookmarks to try one day based on other reviews.  The food was excellent, the service was excellent, the prices and portions were appropriate, I hope we just picked and off day or they do more dinner business because this place is very very good.  Menu wise they offer a little bit of everything wraps, burgers and sandwiches, seafood, chicken and waffles.  I ordered the lunch firecracker shrimp which comes with Parmesan truffle fries.  The fries were super crispy but tender in the middle and seasoned well, more Parmesan than truffle flavor which was fine by me, they were absolutely perfect I thought.  The shrimp we're also excellent, lightly breaded and fresh fried, seasoned well and the dipping sauce was solid.  My friend had the crab cake sandwich and substituted the fried broccoli for fries.  She was very happy with both items, I sampled them both the broccoli was excellent and the crab cake was also good.    The only negative for me and I'm being picky here was when the server asked us what we wanted to drink she said homemade lemonade and my eyes lit up I love lemonade.  Well it wasn't bad at all it's just different, there is pineapple in it and I'm not sure why, it was more a shock than anything else to me, I was just expecting lemonade I've never heard of anyone adding pineapple flavor to it.  Now I love pineapple to eat but not a big fan of its flavor being mixed with beverages.  However like I said the lemonade wasn't bad just different and unexpected.  My only criticism is maybe warn people it has pineapple.  I probably wouldn't have ordered it in that case, but again I'm being as picky as possible here.    I would like to go back and try the chicken and waffles, and the apple pie I saw in another yelp photo looked amazing too.",

It was late afternoon and the restaurant was empty so I ordered takeout from the bar.  I had the Belle wrap(grilled chicken, grilled onions and peppers, mushrooms, lettuce) which was good, but a tad much of the house sauce for me.  I also ordered the chicken alfredo, which came with garlic toast for my son and he loved it but again a little heavy with the sauce but that's just me.

    "text": "We tried Belle Grille for the first time on Friday night (Good Friday).  We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess but she should lose the gum. She walked around constantly twirling it around in her mouth .... not very professional.  The ambience of the place was nice.  We thought they did a great job with decorating and the table and chairs were comfortable.  The servers could use some uniformity as it seemed they could wear whatever. It was Karaoke Friday so the DJ was playing nice old school music which we really enjoyed for the most part....he would play questionable songs at times like the theme song from Frozen....which is a children's movie. However, at times the staff would gather at the back of the restaurant and engage in very LOUD conversations which was distracting.    Our server was good.... very attentive and kept us updated on when we would get our food.  I don't remember her full name but thought she said we could call her Deja. I ordered the Chicken Marsala with broccoli & mashed potatoes and husband ordered the Pork Chop with yellow rice & broccoli...the portions were nice but the food had absolutely NO Seasoning which was terribly disappointing.  We had to ask for salt & pepper shakers because none were on our table which was odd.     We will give them one more try as far as the food goes because maybe that was a fluke.  This place has great potential with some staff training and flavor consistency ( because again I'm hoping the no seasoning was a mishap and not the norm).",

If you are in the area and looking for a nice meal at a decent price you need to check them out. Full bar. Fried broccoli appetizer is really good. #golocal",

However, after watching the moves of our sweet waitress, I honestly believe that she was brand new and we will forgive that.  I think the bartender must have been doing double duty because it did take longer than expected to get our drinks.  Finally, the waitress delivered them, along with our first glasses of water.  Their food is absolutely delicious!  My Buffalo Parmesan Kick'n Chicken \"whole\" wings (and I mean whole - with tips attached) were very good and we totally killed them. Parmesan-truffle fries and Cajun chicken roll were great choices as well, and the sauce served with chicken roll is awesome.  The side salad was good, but the blue cheese dressing wasn't - a different brand would be better. The live entertainment was great, but keep in mind that in a restaurant this size, it can get loud.",

    "text": "I ate at Belle Grille a few months ago and I was blown away. I went with My family and everyone enjoyed their food to the fullest.  The service was great as well and it helped that they hand a band playing which was amazing.  Fast forward to 1/3/19. I needed to pick my husband up from work and coincidentally this place is a few miles away. Well after fighting traffic to pick up my little guy then my husband, I was famished with a horrible headache to go along with it.  I couldn't bare to sit in traffic another hour to get home so I suggested we find a place to eat and this place popped into my head.  When we arrived the place was pretty dead! Normally I'm weary of places that are pretty empty but I was starving and the food was delish last time.   We were seated and given menus. My husband ordered the Chicken Marsala, my little guy had the grilled cheese, fries and fruit and I ordered the fried pork chop, yellow rice and seasonal veggies which consisted of green beans, broccoli and mixed peppers.  When I tell you that this would be my last meal on earth if it came to that, I am not kidding. The pork chop was fried to PERFECTION! Perfection y'all! I don't know what the breading consisted of but good god almighty it was delish. The yellow rice tasted amazing and was perfectly seasoned. The veggies....let me just say I would will never skim on the greens when visiting here. Whatever sauce they tossed the veggies in that was combined with peppers was outstanding. Now I know anything tastes good when you're hungry but let this be my prison meal!!!!!  My husband scoffed down his chicken Marsala dish and had the same reaction to his veggies. My picky little guy ate everything which rarely happens!  The food was so good that I'm still thinking about it! Kudos to the owners who are actually from my husband's hometown of Cleveland Ohio!  I will definitely be back soon!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "We went with high hopes, but the experience didn't match expectations.  The first concern, we walked in and found someone sleeping on the bar.  I assume this was the bartender's child but it didn't set a good starting tone.  The second concern as our host/waiter talked to us was that he was not old enough to drink.  No other staff were visible other than the bartender and this person.   There was soft music playing - and two TV's with sports on them.  Not a great start for a romantic dinner.  One of the TV's volume competed with the music and both seemed to win from time to time.  The tables were set with chintzy paper placemats without any utensils set out.  When our host noticed we had none he brought us a pair - both wrapped in paper napkins - not expected at this price point.    Moving on.  Ordered a caramel apple martini - excellent.  Great start.  Ordered dinner.  The Belle Alfredo (Chicken and Shrimp in their signature alfredo sauce) and the Chicken A'Liege (Chicken Gorgonzola with a Waffle).  Neither main dish came with any sides.  Also we found that many of the prices listed on their website and menu online were different typically $1-3 more in person than claimed online.   The Chicken A'Liege came out.  The waffle was small perhaps the size of my open hand, and the boneless Gorgonzola Chicken was not large but was plump and juice and cooked to perfection.  The chicken I liked.  The waffle was odd.  Inside it were hard chunks of sugar that crunched when you chewed.  This was not expected and frankly not wanted.  The way I like a waffle is swimming in butter (none supplied) and with a little syrup (supplied warmed and yummy but overly sweet in combination with the sugar crystals).   The Belle Alfredo was yummy but it wasn't alfredo.  It was more of a garlic cream cajun sauce - it had a delightful amount of spice and yummy bell pepper and broccoli, but there was hardly any parmesan flavor.  Overall it was a neat dish but shouldn't be called an alfredo given the deviations from the norm.   As the meal wound down we I realized we were one of only two tables the entire time we were there.  Given their early closing on Sunday's (7 by the online information and 6 by the door) I wonder if they will continue to offer dinner on this day.   Food score - a shaky 3 of 5 for taste and 2 of 5 for portions and I'm being overly generous on the portions side honestly.  If traditional dishes are required then drop the score to 2 of 5 for taste since the alfredo is so far from normal as is the waffle. The host/waiter never asked if we needed dessert - a classic upsell moment lost.  He was pleasant but clearly not an expert in the ways of restaurants but he was nice and he tried.   Ambiance score - a weak 2 of 5 for a romantic cozy spot. Likelihood of a repeat visit - very low - I'm done unless someone I trust tells me I'm crazy.   For the record I WANTED to love this place and hoped for a great experience.  If the owners want unsolicited advice here it is:  1) No matter how tempting you need to be there to ensure thing are running well - you can't leave it in the hands of someone so young to be your public face.  2) Make sure your wait staff clearly tells diners about portion size so they know to order sides and extras if they are hungry.  3) Lose the sugar crystals in the waffles and serve with butter - the texture of sugar crystals isn't great and the pop of sweet is overwhelming - at least as a side to a savory dish.  4) Rename your alfredo to \"Belle's spicy garlic cream sauce\" - it's good but needs to be renamed due to the disconnect from the original flavor profile.",

The hostess was very friendly and gracious enough to answer my questions. I decided to return the following day with a few friends and to say we enjoyed the meal would be a huge understatement. We LOVED the meal and our waiter (William) was dee-lightful! William was full of energy, offered suggestions and very attentive. Thank you! I looked over the menu the previous day and my intent was to order chicken & waffles but instead opted for the spinach Florentine omelette, stone grits, and toast. The omelette was amazing and full of flavor! Not salty at all, and a robust flavor.  My friends ordered the Breakfast bowl and a side of pancakes. They were not disappointed.The pancakes were light and served with rich maple syrup. Sunday is \"mimosa\" day but we decided not to indulge (maybe next time). I will be returning to Belle Grille in the very near future, I have to try the chicken & waffles and also the shrimp & grits. #awesomeservice #awesomefood #awesomeplace",

The Belle Grille is one place that I swear I've been to, but not this particular incarnation - though I can't recall what it used to be (not that that is particularly important).  Upon arrival, the staff is friendly, and in fact so friendly that they can't figure out who will be helping you. That's both good and bad. But it works out. The options on the menu are very interesting, and we did not even make it out of the appetizers, just deciding to get a few of them and make a meal of it.  The most interesting was the turkey ribs. Do turkeys have ribs loaded with meat? If they do, I had not seen them previously, but these were easily the star of the show, and it's well worth visiting for this item alone. Plenty of meat, nicely pulling off of the bone and excellent flavor. Well played.",

One-off, family restaurants all have their quirks as mentioned in some other reviews. But, after seeing how passionate and hard working is this family, I gotta light up all that Yelp offers.  Even a 12 yr old asked how was our meal as he sauntered by towards the kitchen.  I like that.   Food?  Two words:  turkey ribs.  They are created from a unique butchering technique across the turkey breast that resembles a country-style pork rib with loads of meat.  A housemade BBQ sauce lathers up the rest of the goodness.  I gotta say, I was blown away.  So. Damn. Good.  I also added the fried broccoli.  I moaned so much at each bite my wife blushed with embarrassment (which is tough to do).  Me like a lot.  Turkey ribs and fried broccoli.  Understand?  Get in your car.  Go here.  Turkey ribs.  Fried brocolli.  Got my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter just a twirlin'.",

I had the Belle Fajita Omelet (grilled chicken and ribeye, 3 eggs, pepper jack cheese, green and yellow bell pepper, sour cream ... leave out the home fries and salsa). Hubby had the Belle Burger (6oz burger, 2 strips of applewood bacon, Asiago cheese, lettuce & tomato ... hold the bun and sub a Caesar salad for the fries). Keto friendly all the way.   Lots of great brunch specials (on Sunday), including bottomless mimosas.   Thanks to Keisha for being a great host, and for teaching is that Belle is really just a clever take on Belly. If your Belly is hungry, come to Belle- you're sure to be satisfied.",

    "text": "My wife and I finally dropped by this highly rated little eatery for a 2:00 Friday lunch and our initial impressions were mixed at best. Following the advice of fellow Yelpers, we started with the Fried Broccoli with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and had the Belle Salads as our meals. We also had iced teas that (EEK... sound the beverage gouging alarm!) ran $2.50 each.   The tempura battered Fried Broccoli was  golden brown and tasty, but things broke down a little when it came to the salads. The fried shrimp and sliced chicken breast that topped them were indeed crunchy, hot and savory and the accompanying sauces - one hot, one sweet - were the perfect complements. They were also beautifully presented and full of good veggies, however, we found the salads themselves to be disappointing. A stickler when it comes to fresh lettuce, we just had to pick out too many brown ended and slimey pieces to be totally satisfied. The cherry tomatoes were also tasteless and mushy, and the croutons and bread were just okay. At $14 each, we expected a lot better.  Our server, Keisha, was attentive and friendly, and was passionate in describing the menu choices. The dining area was comfortable and attractive, and the sanitation rating was an impressive 97.5.   After an $8 off coupon, our total lunch tab, including tip, ran right at $40. Our dining experience may have been an anomaly, however, as most of the other reviews have been very positive. We will give it at least one more shot though because we have to try the Chicken and Waffles (but not without a coupon).",

Thank god for Grubhub, helps lazy guys like myself get quality food.  How lazy you ask, well I could walk to this establishment in about 8 minutes.  I won't, and I never will walk to this place.  At some point I'm sure to actually visit this because it's so tasty.  I order about twice a month.  I have had a few different things and they are all amazing.  The firecracker shrimp is a must try.  The mozzarella sticks might be the best I have ever tired.  The crab cakes are super tasty, the sauce that's on the side is on the spicy side so if your not into spice done dump it all over the cakes.  Also check out the fried broccoli, it's crazy delicious.",

You will have to see for yourself what I mean.  I ordered the fish sandwich (tilapia) without the bread.  And I ordered fries to go with it. And iced tea.   The tilapia was fair; it was a bit undercooked for my taste. The fries were way too greasy and too salty, which for some, might be a good thing.  Not for me.  The star of the show here was the fried broccoli. It was simply outstanding. The iced tea seemed weak to me.  Many of their menu items were no longer available.  WTH?    I wanted the fried green beans, but they were not available.  There were many other things, like the salads, that were not available. The excuse given was the recent health scare with romaine lettuce. I wonder if they have heard of spinach or iceberg or arugula? There are ways around the romaine issue.   Anyway, I respect my fellow Yelpers, but I have to respectfully disagree on the greatness of this one. If you go, do it for the broccoli and the atmosphere.  There are other things that may entertain you there. Go find out for yourself.",

    "text": "I had ordered from here via Postmates and fell in love with their Belle Salad. So I told my mom about the place and we went one night after church. Small intimate setting. We were first greeted by a male waiter very nice and then our waitress came over. She had on leggings, short t shirt and tennis shoes. She literally looked like she just got off the couch. Very nice but compared to the male waiter who was appropriately dressed in all black it was odd.  Then a random woman who was also dressed down with a purse on her arm was walking around and spoke to us. Later on we were told she was the owner but she never introduced herself so we honestly thought she was a weird customer just taking to strangers.   They then brought out the wrong salad to my mom. They then brought her the right salad \"The cranberry salad\" and it had not 1 cranberry on it. By this time I was finished with my salad and we were ready to leave. We waited and waited but she and I were enjoying the music and though disappointed in the service not mad.  Finally after 20 min of the salad mixup the \"manager\" came over. She never apologized and just asked if we we ready for the checks. When I said my mom shouldn't have a check because...she quickly interrupted and said I took care of that. No apology. As if somehow it was our fault. She then came back with the checks and kneeled down and looked at me and said\"are you mad? Is that why you have that look in your face?\" I was stunned!! It was very passive aggressive and being a retail manager myself I couldn't imagine treating a customer like that. The whole experience was so odd.  Anyway good food though appetizer was cold. A little pricey for what it is but TERRIBLE service.",

The restaurant itself is in a nice location, kind of in the center of a shopping center. They have a nice little patio with outside setting. The inside is dimly lit and has a romantic feel. Friday & Saturday evening they have live music, we caught a little bit of it & the saxophonist was good. Started off with the fried broccoli, it was good but nothing special. Had a tempura batter and the broccoli itself was cooked perfectly, served with a side of sweet chili sauce which made the dish.  For my main dish I choose the turkey ribs which were perfect and I would highly recommend that dish, it comes with mashed sweet potato & a melody of vegetables. The ribs just fell off the bone & the bbq sauce was tasty.  The service was good. And the owner even came out and thanked us for coming.",

But I also want the restaurant to succeed, so, you should go. We found it thanks to Yelp and thought it sounded like a great new option to try. It is a bit hidden in a shopping center with a grocery store and other retail stores, but definitely worth finding! Staff was friendly (shout out to Walker for being patient with us and making menu recommendations) and the food was great. We had a sampler appetizer with kickin' chicken tenders, firecracker shrimp and the fried broccoli. Honestly, the fried broccoli was my least favorite, but it was still a fun, new thing to try. I prefer a crunchier crust if I'm going to eat a friend veggie. However, I will be ordering the firecracker shrimp as my meal the next time we go. They were fabulous! I ordered the chicken a'liege (chicken and waffle), and this was branching out for me, but I really enjoyed it crispy chicken with (I think) a Gorgonzola \"sauce\" on top and a sweet, crunchy waffle. I would definitely order it again. My husband had the crab cakes with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. He ate every bite. Apparently the owners used to operate a food truck and have moved into a restaurant. I'm so glad!!!",

Originally a Richmond native, we had been missing the great local restaurants that we had been used to. To me, Belle Grille wasn't all that it was made out to be. It's casual dining down to the paper napkins and the taste. I ordered the tilapia Alfredo for a main and the firecracker shrimp as an app. The tilapia had been seared a little too long on the grill leaving a burn taste all around. The firecracker shrimp had me thinking of a bang bang shrimp like item, but it was only fried shrimp with a spicy mayonnaise dip. No real beer selection other than miller and bud lite is what I was told. Overall, the restaurant has a nice ambiance and atmosphere, but the taste did not deliver as I had hoped.",

However, next time we stop for lunch or dinner I might just have to go \"out of the box\" and get more creative since everything at The Belle Grille is SOOOO very good!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!",

Drinks were standard cocktails and good.  The fried broccoli appetizer was unique and delicious.  The fried chicken was EXCELLENT in the chicken a'liege!  Will definitely return.",

It took about 10-15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them. We tried the fried broccoli per Yelp recommendations and thought it was pretty good. I ordered the chicken marsala for my entree and it was chicken with all cooked onions - no mushrooms at all (it was the weirdest thing, and super disappointing!) My husband ordered the crab cakes and thought they were great (they were recommended by waitress.) I guess I was a little disappointed by the ambiance as well - I knew it was in a strip mall so expected that \"feel\" but the wait staff were all in casual daytime outfits, jeans and casual tops, etc. I think having a dress code for wait staff would go a long way. It just felt super casual and not special. Food was average.",

    "text": "My husband, our 5 year old and I were looking for a lunch place after hitting the park and The Belle Grille came up in yelp with a 5-star rating. We had never heard of this place (only around for 3-4 months), so we figured we'd give it a shot. It was 12:20p and the restaurant was empty, but that didn't worry us. We checked out the menu and it looked pretty good. We ordered the appetizer sampler, which included the fried broccoli that the hostess said 'everyone loves', plus chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks. The broccoli was okay, but the fried mozzarella was not great and the chicken fingers were all crunch and very little chicken. The chicken that was encased in super-fried coating was very stringy and definitely not tender. My son got a grilled cheese and fruit cup, typical kid fare. I was surprised the fruit wasn't fresh . . . just one of those packaged cups of cubed peaches and pears in syrup. My husband ordered a salad and the Cajun (?) spring rolls. The salad was a good size and he said it was fresh, so that was a plus. The spring rolls were VERY greasy, with mushy red peppers and some sort of chicken in them. The flavor was gross and the oil dropped out when each of us took a bite. After our initial taste, we let the server know we didn't want any more. I ordered a turkey burger, with steamed broccoli as my side. It took about 10 minutes to get mustard after the burger arrived, but it didn't really matter. The brioche bun had been either buttered (or sprayed with oil?) on both sides and was soaked. I took a couple of bites, but it wasn't worth the calories (which I don't tend to count ever). I'm not certain the burger was turkey, possibly beef; either way it was over-cooked (fried) yet still greasy. Since I don't eat red meat, that was another reason not to eat any more.  This review may sound like I don't eat fried foods, but that is far from the truth. I would eat fried foods all day long (don't tell my doctor), but I don't want my fried foods to drip, ooze or sit in grease. Sadly, this is the first and last time we will go to The Belle Grille.  Both my husband and I felt like we could hear Robert Irvine (Restaurant Impossible) or Gordon Ramsay (Kitchen Nightmare) critiquing every aspect of the restaurant as if they were doing their shows. We got the feeling that the restaurant is a venture from someone who has no background in running a restaurant, but likes to cook (fry) a lot.  On the plus side, the spring rolls and my burger were taken off our bill. P.S. By the time we left, most of the 2 and 4 person tables were full, so maybe we just ordered all the wrong things.",

I looked at the menu, pics, and reviews and decided The Belle Grille was a must try. I was NOT disappointed. Actually WE were not disappointed. We both loved it. The atmosphere was amazing, the service was superb, and the food was great. This is my first 5-star review and it was well earned. We will definitely be back!",
