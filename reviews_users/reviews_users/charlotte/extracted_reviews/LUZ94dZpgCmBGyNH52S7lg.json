    "text": "I had been waiting anxiously for this place to open ever since construction started. Walking by everyday it seemed like there was something big on the way. Since it has opened, I have visited for lunch and drinks. For lunch, flatbreads,  fish tacos, and the banh mi sandwich were ordered. Everyone was very satisfied and found each dish quite flavorful. I myself ordered a side Greek salad which came out as the largest \"side\" I've ever had. Fresh feta was a great touch. As far as drinks, they have an extensive wine list that I love - you can order 1/2 glasses of wine! Makes it great to explore or just have enough. Also, the cocktails are very tasty and all syrups and mixers are made in house. A major plus!! Be sure to order the ginger smash. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes!",

    "text": "Kindly, I give Essex a 2 star rating - because I had eaten there 3 times and had EXCELLENT experiences. The Bang Bang Grouper is just like Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish, but BETTER. Then tonight I visited with a friend out of town, raved about it with my husband and left in complete disappointment. We will have to be dragged to go back. Let's dive right into my astounding experience - we ordered 2 appetizers, of which took an abnormally like time to receive...1 never came out and was still included on the bill. Excuse for the 2nd appetizer not being made was stated as \"the kitchen ran out of flatbread.\" Okay, I can understand the kitchen may run out of menu items, but why wait 20 minutes to tell us and not offer a replacement? Next came entrees - the Rib Eye, then Gnocchi. Then 10 minutes later the Buttered Chicken and Tuna Tartare still never arrived. My husband asked our waiter where the rest of the food was and he quickly asked back \"What did you get again?\". We spoke to the manager, he was prompt to bring out the Chicken, but offered it with the clock ticket to show the time it was submitted in the system. Tuner tartare finally came when we asked for the check. My review ends here. Goodluck to this restaurant surviving Charlotte much longer. This restaurant needs new management. Only visit if you want 1/2 your ordered food and have time to wait.",

The flavor superb and we always get extra naan to dip in the sauce. The Kalbi Beef is another favorite. The beef on the puree with the kimchi and sweet glaze has a wonderful flavor. The kalbi beef slider is another must. They are small tender lamb and beef patties with hummus with so much flavor. The pan seared scallops is another must served over cauliflower puree with fried cauliflower and curry. The scallops were seared perfectly. We also ordered the butter chicken. This is a tomato sauce littered with great spices and the chicken was tender and juicy making it that much better. This place is great for large groups or small. It can be a bit loud in there but is has been very busy since it open and I expect it to stay that way being one of the few good places we like in Uptown.",

I was hoping to be impressed; however, I was disturbed. I went with a group of 8 (6 of whom live in CLT). The service was horrible. Our waitress was rude and inconsiderate. Additionally, she forgot 3 people's drink orders and didn't deliver a ketchup when asked twice. When I ordered my drink and kindly asked and instructed her to please squeeze a lemon into it but throw the rind away, she acted as though I requested that she recite the Girl Scout Pledge on one foot with a blind fold on. Furthermore, the portions were inconsistent. A group of 12 could've shared the brioche French toast, yet the fish tacos I ordered would barely nourish a 6 month old. In terms of the drinks, I'd like to thank all the bartenders there who appear to be my new AA sponsors. Tighten up and give us a little more fuel. You guys gotta iron out the details. Regardless, the waffle fries were lovely.  P.S- Fix the plating of the Heuvos Rancheros. The black bean puree resembles what my hardwood floor looks like the morning after I drunkenly feed my lab a burrito.",

    "text": "Thank you Essex for a wonderful Thanksgiving.  We had friends in town and we spent the morning watching the parade and decided to go to Essex for Bloody Mary's and a light lunch as we had reservations at another local restaurant for dinner.  The service was AMAZING... Our server Jelani was extremely nice and very attentive.  If you go, you have to have the Brussels Sprout Salad... to die for.   They had a Thanksgiving dinner plate ($25) that had everything you could want on one plate (Turkey, ham, mashed potatoes with gravy, stuffing, sweet potatoes, green bean casserole and fresh/homemade cranberry sauce).  It looked delicious but as we wanted to save room for our dinner we stuck with a light lunch.  Over the course of the day, we kept talking about how we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the service at Essex that we decided to cancel our dinner reservations and go back to Essex to partake in their Thanksgiving dinner...which by the way was $15.00 cheaper then the other restaurant we planned on going.  We asked for Jelani and had even better service than the first time.  It was everything we expected and more.  We had the Brussels Sprout Salad...AGAIN, my husband and I shared the Thanksgiving Dinner (more than enough for 2) and desert.  I would highly recommend Essex for lunch or dinner!  We gave a rave review to the Service Manager Kevin Powell and even he was great to deal with.  HIGHLY recommend for lunch, dinner, special occasion!",

To keep it short, our appetizer was never delivered (kitchen problem per server), my guest had a hair in her meal, our drinks sat empty for 20 mins, we were told the manager would be coming to speak with us not once, but also reminded he would be out soon... he never arrived. We overplayed for the junk we had that was delivered and didn't have a hair in it. It is rare that I feel embarrassed for a restaurant... but it was genuine embarrassment.",

We ordered the shrimp and grits and a calamari dish. Both were amazing but the shrimp and grits were above and beyond. We sat at an area outside overlooking the street on the patio. The atmosphere was really amazing.....except my seat was facing the building and the area where the trays for bussing tables were held. We weren't able to move though, even though it was pretty empty when we visited. The waitress told us that since we were a party of two, most of the seats outside were for four people...or larger parties, and that some of the seats might be reserved. Overall though, food was good and service was great",

Tip- Request for seating further back. Not as noisy.  There were two waiters who provided service for nine people.  One waiter was taking an order and then skipped to another person before the person finished placing their order.  The waiter relayed that this was a tapas and the food was enough to share and should place two orders. I ordered the lamb slider which was two small pieces. How am I going to share this with 8 other people.   The Lamb sliders were so spicy that I needed water and had to flagged down the waiter for a refill. They were not attentive when it came to refilling water. Place was dark maybe hard to see?  I ended up enjoying the cookies from the exchange more so than the food.",

I ordered lobster tacos and it was laughable how small they were, at $20 you would expect a little more especially since they were really good. I also got their crusty crab sushi rolls, omg amazing. It's a cool spot to grab a bite for lunch but not if you expect to get a full coarse meal. The food does not come out at the same time, it came as its prepared. The birthday actually was last to receive her food after everyone else was done. I left disappointed because I didn't eat all day and was still hungry. Food was good just not filling",

The first problem we ran into was waiting over 20 minutes past our reservation time, which is one of my biggest peeves. A well run restaurant shouldn't make patrons with a reservation try to squeeze in at a full bar to chit chat and try to kill time. It was pretty crowded to stand with coats in hand trying not to spill on the people passing through.  After we were seated we were in a somewhat awkward spot along the hallway to the bathroom. Across from the wine wall which was nice decor but the constant stream of people and tight quarters to the table behind us was not the romantic date night atmosphere we had anticipated.  Food - we got the butter chicken again. Absolutely delicious a second time around. I love the huge loafs of naan that it comes with.  Short rib ravioli was also a win though it came in a smaller portion than I had anticipated. That was okay though because our next dish, the gambas al ajillo, was bigger (and a touch tarter) than I thought it would be. We also ordered the sashimi tacos which were spicy but overall I enjoyed them. We also got a random order of tacos left on our table, and sent them back after realizing they weren't the right tacos. Then after we had paid someone tried to drop off more sashimi tacos at our table.  I totally debated eating those but didn't want to deprive the person who ordered them so sent them back as well.  Drinks - the essex smash I had and the bacon old fashioned my boyfriend had were both delicious. Toward the end of dinner I was reviewing the drink menu and ordered a daiquiri since I hadn't had one in ages and thought it could double as dessert. At first the waitress said they didn't sell daiquiris then remember they have a new cocktail tap machine. The daiquiri on the rocks that came out was quite a disappointment.  None of the food was disappointing but the whole disorganized night, even though they opened months before, puts this in my lunch restaurants list rather than a tapas dinner or date night place.",

It took an hour to get our food for a group of only 11 - many of us had salads.  One person in my group had to leave because she had meetings.  When they brought the food out it was not all delivered at the same time so some people had to wait up to 20 minutes to start eating just staring at their food.  The wait staff was unapologetic and the manager never even came to our table to say anything.  When someone from our group found the manager to complain they took 25% off our bill and then added a 20% gratuity.",

The food has a lot to offer. I have had a few sharable items and enjoy them all. I really like the flatbread pizzas, the essex dip trio and their cheese & Charcuterie platter were great. The falafel was just ok. I found that the falafel itself (chickpeas) was over cooked. The drinks are really good too, especially their cocktails on tap!!!

    "text": "I'm going to refrain from using names until I have to.   On Wednesday, August 29 my friends and I dined at the Essex Bar & Bistro for the first time. Two of us arrived approximately 4ish and attempted to enjoy our dining experience. The  food was absolutely delicious. It was fresh, and presentation was lovely.  Meanwhile,  the discourteous mannerisms of our waitress resulted in a unfavorable experience. Her I'll-fated disposition and snappy attitude forced us to conclude our dining experience, leaving a tip that matched her customer service skills. We left the patio area of Essex & enjoyed the live music playing by a team of DJs just outside on the Bank of America platform.   This team of DJs were accompanied by the ASPCA, the host of this outside music event.   As a few of us enjoyed the musical dedication to Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin and a serious of House music, some went FACEBOOK \"LIVE\".  What I captured from the corner of a LIVE video was a white male waiter standing on the entrance steps of Essex with his 2 female coworkers. All 3 Essex employees (waiters) were  appearing to be engaged in the phenomenal musical selections played by the talented African American male DJ group.   Right before my eyes I watched the male toss a lemon, yes food, directly at the DJ booth.  Shocked, appalled and a tad bit confused I watched the 3 employees giggle until they noticed me watching.  The lemon actually rolled away from the DJ booth in my direction.  I picked it up and asked the male waiter who tossed it did he mean to; as if I didn't know any better.  All three Essex workers scurried back into the restaurant.  I immediately approach my other 2 friends who were on the patio eating to request the Manager.  The Manager didn't respond after 10 minutes so I went inside and asked for him.  Approximately 5 minutes later the manager arrived and I shared the disgraceful behavior of his employee.  While the Manager acknowledged my concern, and observed that the male waiter was nowhere in site. he confirmed he knew exactly who I was referring to indicating there was only 2 male waiters.  He walked inside said \"thank you I'll take care of it!\" 1. What happen to an apology, a sincere one? 2. Was this normal behavior patterns of the staff at ESSEX? 3. Is the inappropriate manner in which the food item was handled a habitual practice in ESSEX? 4. Why would he toss a food item at anyone? 5. What message and/or attack was this waiter trying to deliver? 6. When does the audacious belittling ignorant approaches and attacks stop? 7. Who will be responsible or take responsibility for people who show lack of respect for humans in the midst of a universal \"love\"....music!?  Although the food was pleasing to my palate recommending a dining experience at Essex is something I will refrain from doing!",

Below are more specific ratings..  Asian-style flash fried Grouper (think bang bang shrimp but on a whole other level). 10/10..crowd favorite!! Perfectly flavored, not soggy, nice crisp and a good portion.  -Brussel Sprouts Caesar salad...8/10..creamy, filling, great flavor..needed salt   -lamb sliders...8/10, very flavorful, comes with 2, cooked to order, crispy exterior for medium but very good.  -Curried fried cauliflower 7/10...tasty sauce, heavy dish, large portion. Good but gets old after a couple bites.  -calamari...8/10...classic, done well! Crispy and great flavor  -Kale and apple salad...9/10...predictable but so good!!  -Short rib ravioli..7/10...very good but primarily cheese..not a real strong indication of any meat. It's good but ravs are small and the sauce is heavy.   Nice atmosphere, decent service, pricey but normal...comparable to Good Food on Montford in my opinion.  A little tricky to find if u are depending on the gps. It's beside the Omni Hotel.  I will be back!!",

May have been due to the chilly night.  Menu has many good items to try. I wish we were with a larger group. Each item and drinks are around $15 each so it adds up quickly when trying several things. Most items are only enough for 2 people so you need to order a few to fill up. We were served super fast. Food came out way to fast and would have enjoyed if they staggered them to enjoy our meal better.  Brussel spout ceasar salad was ok Triple dip was delicious. Wonderful guacamole! Short Rib homemade ravioli was delicious! (and I'm not usually a short rib fan) Mahi bites were delicious. Didn't expect fried but sauce and fish was wonderful",

The ceviche and Brussels sprouts salad was pretty good but the shawarma pita had too much going on. Also for the size of the dishes it was a bit overpriced for Charlotte. Also our dear waitress wouldn't leave us alone for 5 minutes - she interrupted us so many times.

They have about 20-25 bar stools and two bartenders and they can't keep up. This is not isolated, but a nightly event. It's bad.   There is an arrogance in this restaurant. They think they are good simply by their location. The management does nothing. They are more concerned about how they look, and prancing around. They don't serve customers . Charlotte is too stupid to know good service in new restaurants, but they'll figure it out. This place will die.",

Highlights were short rib raviolis-(everyone at our table voted this their favorite of all our choices) spicy tuna tar tar and Essex dip trio.  The meatballs and Brussels sprouts were good too.  Would pass on charcuterie board.  Pros: location, ambiance, menu  Cons: location/BMX bikers jumping off of handicapped ramp past table",

We started with the waiter's 3 suggestions - the brussel sprout caesar, butter chicken, korean bbq shrimp tacos - all were delicious! Second course we did the veal meatballs, shawarma pita, and fried cauliflower. I would have gone without the shawarma and cauliflower, but all other dishes were excellent and flavorful. I would definitely return to try the rest of the menu items!",

We ordered the warm Brussels sprouts salad to share and each got an order of the Korean BBQ shrimp tacos with a side of waffle fries.

Next staff member more than balanced out that eye contact aspect though, as upon seeing us walk in she froze like a deer in headlights and just.... stayed like that. Seriously, I gave it about two minutes just to see if she was gonna do anything and just a statue staring right at us. I've never seen anything like it. Am I bothering you? Did you forget the line? It's \"hi.\" Weird. Long removed from the situation, I feel like if I was still standing there, she would be also. I almost want to say fear.  Bartender did at the end join in and also stare at us and do nothing. Left and went somewhere else. Strangest thing I've seen in quite some time. Menu looked pretty good, so, it's too bad. Does, however, explain why they had only one table at peak brunch hours on a Saturday. Really uncomfortable, and again, just weird.",

I am not sure if it all went down hill because it was the coldest night in charlotte and their building layout affects the ventilation carrying the air into the restaurant..... or the fact our server didn't have the slightest training or idea about their menu. Not only that, even the people delivering the food to the table didn't know what we were getting, this happened multiple times.   We ordered about twenty of their dishes. The lamb sliders were a bit dry. The potato gnocchi was undercooked. We had so many other things but I will just jump to the ones that stood out....this is what was actually delicious:   1) fried cauliflower 2)Butter chicken- it s their version of the tikka masala and it was wonderful. It is also served with their homemade bread which is absolutely fluffy and yummy!  3) cheese and charcuterie plate- chef selection also served w the bread  4) tuna poke tacos  5) for dessert the golden apple and the strawberry mousse.

Parking can be difficult to find but Essex validates parking at 205 S church St.  With reservations we were quickly seated and on a Tuesday night the restaurant was extremely crowded.  The restaurant was extremely loud and hard for my party of 6 to hear each other talk across the table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and nicely decorated. The patio is a great and is always crowded.  For restaurant week Essex offered a great deal, a soup or salad, 2 small plates and a dessert for $35. I started with a Greek salad which was ok. I ordered the butter chicken and the ham, sausage and bacon flat bread. The flat bread was good but I enjoyed the braised short rib flat bread that a friend ordered. The butter chicken was really good and tasted pretty authentic. The naan bread was great and I probably could've ate the naan bread by itself. For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which was really good.   Overall I enjoyed the dinner with friends and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I could see myself coming back for a happy hour or dinners with friends.",

The other servers were very attentive to the other tables and later on we noticed people getting acknowledged as soon as they were seated, so take from that what you want. I wanted to leave but my friend addressed the hostess about this issue and moments later our server came.   We both ordered passion fruit mimosas, which were overpriced and lacked champagne, but was very tasty. I ordered the huevos rancheros & my friend ordered the steak & eggs. The food came out fast and the presentation was great. I didn't like the sauce on my order and my egg was over cooked. They over cooked the egg on my friends dish as well (we both ordered over easy and got over hard) but she really liked her dish, even recommended it to this couple sitting across from us. I sent mine back and ordered their home fries and sauce (I tasted my friends dish and love that part of it, I didn't try the actual steak) I also ordered 2 over easy eggs, which were again over hard.   I'm hoping I caught them on a off day, but the ambience was great and I would go back again to give them another try.",

Server came quick for drink orders but that seemed to be the only time he was readily available. We were seated in a back area and that must have fostered us being out of sight and mind. Orders were straight forward salads, flatbread, tacos, and burgers...no allergies. They took an eternity. After a good 30-40 minutes, server came to let us know he would be checking on our meal with the kitchen (initiated by a colleague's leering stink-eye I found out). Miraculously he returned with our meal we had been anxious to receive. Since our mouths were watering we didn't notice until digging in that the items had likely been under heat lamps on the line for quite a while. The fries had a stale taste and the items that you would expect to be warm were barely such (and a big stretch from 'hot'). A new order of fries was requested but we weren't confident that they didn't just re-fry the current batch since the original set was removed. Some of my colleagues enjoyed their selections but none of us could overcome how terrible our service was. With meetings to hurry back to after lunch taking much longer than anticipated I didn't get the chance to speak with management about our issues; but nor did a manager or anyone else ever come to see how things were...",

We ordered a total of 11 plates of food to share amongst 7 people and it was a pretty good amount to fill us up. We got the Kalbi Beef Tacos, Korean BBQ Shrimp Tacos, Bang Bang Grouper, Shrimp and Grits, Butter Chicken, Potato Gnocchi, Stuffed Mushrooms(although we ordered a mushroom flatbread but it's all good), and the Essex Dip Trio.   It was good! I'm not WOWED, everything tasted great but nothing like pushed passed the IMPRESSIVE point. The tapas are pretty expensive, but that's expected for a place like this. I do recommend getting the Bang Bang Grouper, it was delicious. The Butter Chicken had a very distinctive curry flavor that wasn't a favorite for many of the people I came with. Their menu is really extensive, but I noticed there aren't a lot of chicken options. I would still like to come back and try the rest of the items though!",

I was so excited to finally try this place out because all my friends had been raving about the service and the amazing food, but unfortunately I had an awful experience. My group decides to arrive for a late brunch on Sunday with a rather big group, so because of it being a big group I didn't expect excellent service. Though we had a big group there was no reason for the type of service I received, we all order our food and it all comes out sporadically of course because we are in a big group. so I think nothing of it for my food to be taking so long. After 2 hours of being there though, I have had my limit of waiting because everyone else has gotten their food except for two other friends and I. The server April finally processed to walk up to the table and goes \"Oh who ordered the Bahn Mi chicken, I forgot to tell you we don't make that item anymore what can we get you?\"Oh may I add that I had ordered a warm Brussel sprout Cesar salad that still didn't come out either. She proceeds to give me the dinner menu now so that I could reorder because they don't have the brunch menu available anymore and tells me to order something that's equal amount to what I had ordered before. I finally get my meal and everything was delicious I got the beef short rib sliders and the warm Brussel sprouts Cesar salad with sweet potato waffle fries and they all were amazing. But the service overall was horrible. Maybe it was the size of my group or waitress i don't know but my experience was poor.  Oh and to add to my frustration while I was there, there was no heat in the building when it was 20 degrees outside that day.   I may give this place one more try just because the food was amazing despite the service.",

We were seated for 15 mins with no water no silverware no nothing. I finally flagged down the busboy and he gave us water. The waiter finally cane his name was Tyler. We placed our drink order that took another 15mins. Then we placed our food order It's restaurant week so i ordered the 3 course meal Greek salad... curry mussels mushroom flatbread and raspberry dessert. That took 27 mins! Several people who were seated around us had already gotten their food..one couple that sat behind us had ordered..ate and was now leaving! I group of 7 people ....2 adults and 5 kids had come in placed orders and still had their food before mine! By this time i was livid!! When it was time to do pay the check instead of asking..Tyler put both of our checks together. I told him that i had the $35 meal sand 1 drink and my friend had the rest. He still didn't split it right so he had to fix it again by then it was 6:07pm! I was almost late for my event but i won't come back ... No one waited an hour to two hours for food by my friend and I...i wonder why?",

    "text": "Loved the atmosphere and culture in Essex. It is very lively and happening, and is quite loud, so maybe not the best for an intimate, romantic setting. They have a lovely cockail menu, though it's always hard to justify spending $12.00 per drink.    I went for restaurant week. At most places, restaurant week isn't a great judge of quality or character (in my opinion), because either the menu is limited, or places are cooking in advance. I didn't feel that way about Essex. They had everything available on the menu and offered the option for TWO entrees. They did cut down on the appetizers and offered just a greek or kale salad for your starter. The menu is wide ranging, and delicious, with various seafood, meat and flatbread items. I went with a girlfriend and split things to try it all. We went with the short rib flatbread, the bang bang grouper, the shawarma pita, and the lamb sliders.  Of all, my favorite was the bang bang grouper. Our server told us it is one of their more popular menu items - it started as a special but has stayed on the menu due to popularity. It did not disappoint and had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy with fried batter. Yum! I also liked the braised short rib flatbread, though don't be mistaken - you don't get a ton of meat on there. It wasn't a crisp flatbread like I prefer, but the cheesiness and creaminess made up for it. The herb ricotta and caramelized onion puree was very good.   I wouldn't order the shawarma pita again - I found it to be VERY DRY and unappealing. I love tahini, but this pita was just not working. The lamb sliders were decent. What I liked about them was a charcoal taste that reminded you of cooking by the campfire. I would have liked them to be a little juicier though.  Overall, service was good, considering it was restaurant week and very busy. I wish it were a little quieter inside. It was difficult to have a conversation at our table. There's still much more I'd like to try on the menu if we ever return.",

Inside was reservation only, so we stuck with the outside patio and waited about 5 mins for a table to be available.   They are tapas style, so you want to order more than 1 thing to really eat. I got the chicken skewers and they were cooked perfectly. Super tasty. I know the second thing I ordered was sushi, but I can't remember which one. Possibly chicken sushi...anyway it was amazing. And I'm not huge on sushi, but I loved this.  My friends ordered the caesar brussel sprouts and another type of sushi that were both also delicious.  Service was a little slow but I attribute that to restaurant week. Will be back!",

Shrimp and lobster on the tacos taste like they are one and the same and I actually had to ask if they brought me the wrong taco. The shrimp is small, probably a 21/25 and taste iodiny. Not good.  Lobster Tacos? You sure it was lobster?? Asian Chicken Salad poses as an interesting entree and turns out to be no more that a chicken salad lunch special.   The Flatbread was good, but I can make it at home. Falafel, really?? Cheese board, can't mess that up. . Baked Alaska was too frozen. The Beignolis were the best thing there.  Overall, the place is pretty, cool date ambience, but the food is overpriced and just average. If you think the food is really good, you have no taste at all. I'm heading back to the Soul Gastrolounge,",

    "text": "As a \"hot and new\" restaurant in the heart of Uptown, Essex garners a solid 4 stars for: hip ambiance (4.5 stars); mediocre service (3 stars); delicious food (4.5 stars); and disappointing desserts (2.5 stars).  Overall, we really enjoyed the dining experience and due to its close proximity to where we live, we will definitely be back.  The small plates style cuisine is described as \"world food,\" meaning they have a little something from every country.    TIP:  parking can be an issue and if you want to sit on the patio,  I recommend making reservations.    Hip and trendy ambiance.  Essex is located on the corner of Tryon and Trade.  We came on a Thursday evening at 7 pm and it seemed that the seats were bountiful inside but the patio was at near capacity, which is where we sat.   The general vibe is hip and trendy with modernesque decor.   They don't have fans or heat lamps on the patios yet but they have only been open for 2 weeks.    Mediocre service.  Overall, the service was good but there is definitely room for improvement (I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since they are still in their nascent stage).  The staff is polite, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items.  However, they can improve in the following areas: __  wait time.  After our server dropped off our drinks, we waited an additional 5-7 minutes with our menus closed before he came back to take our food order. __  spilled drink.  Our server spilled our drink on his hand, onto my BFs plate and went to wipe off his hands but did not replace the plate.  If it were my plate, I would have said something, but my BF is much more forgiving. __  water refill.  Our server left the water pitcher on our table for a few minutes (leading us to believe this was our own refill pitcher, which is frequently done in other restaurants) but came back to retrieve it and used it to refill water on other tables.  For sanitary purposes, I would prefer only the waitstaff to handle or have access to the food and drinks that I'm going to be served. __  food delivery.  After we ordered, our food arrived extremely quickly -- all of it.  Granted, this is a small plates, tapas-style restaurant and the food is meant for sharing but we did order several items and they barely fit on our small two-top table.  Plus, it made us feel rushed to consume all of it because we didn't want the food to get cold.  Satiating drinks.  Kudos to the bartender for preparing delicious drinks, leaning heavy on the alcohol side.  Delicious food.  The food is delicious, complex and although small plates, filling.  We had: ---------DELICIOUS (must try): ++  kale and apple salad.  The creamy semi-sweet vinaigrette dressing is thoroughly mixed into every bite of the salad, which had cranberries for sweetness, nuts for crunch, apples for tartness, cabbage for texture and little bits of bacon for smokiness.  The portion is pretty large, enough for 4 to sample two spoonfuls.  This was my BFs favorite item (and he doesn't usually like kale). ++  ceviche.  I LOVE ceviche and the only disappointing thing was that the portion was very small.  It had the right blend of saltiness, onions, tomatoes, fish and cilantro with the perfect amount of lemon so that every bite had the same consistency and flavor.  I didn't want to share this. ----------VERY GOOD (tasty but I'd try something different next time): ++  rock shrimp.  I would personally put this in the must try category, but my BF didn't like it as much.  The shrimp are marinated in a lemon-based, garlic, butter and herb sauce, served with yummy garlic bread.  The sauce is much more tangy than your standard shrimp scampi, with chili peppers scattered throughout.  ++  short rib ravioli.  The ravioli is freshly made (soft texture) with a sauce that reminded me of beef stew, all served on top of mashed cauliflower (which gave it a sweetness unlike mashed potatoes).  Mixing all of it together melted in your mouth; a great comfort food presented in an unconventional way. ++  lobster tacos.  The lobster was a little on the tough side but had a nice blend of avocado, cabbage garnish and semi sweet and spicy aioli, served on a corn soft shell.  I would have liked it to be served with a lime garnish to add a little kick to it, to compliment the lobster.  Disappointing desserts.  We would usually only order 1 but wanted to try 2 different items.  We had the: ++  Baked Alaska, which was supposed to have layers of mango and strawberry gelato with cake, around a mousse.  The whole thing was too rich and tasted like cake that had been sitting in the freezer for too long. ++  creme brulee.  We love creme brulee, but this one had fruit infused into the vanilla custard, which detracted from and added a weird flavor to it.  Essex is definitely a hot new place to try, even if at least once.  It takes traditional cuisine and successfully adds a modern, unconventional yet complex spin to it so that you embark on a culinary journey.",

I have to say I did arrive \"late\" 9:30 pm and it is Charlotte on a Tuesday night so it was ghost town but the restaurant was not to close until 11pm . In walking in we were told the kitchen was closing in 15min. So we ordered as rushed as we could had the mushroom appetizer it was great and different. I had the churro  skirt steak and deconstructed scallop potatoes. Great concept but my food was at best room temp. So don't want to wonder why the last meal out of the kitchen was cold  but it was taken off the check .  Great glass wear for drinks that was a treat. So maybe go for drinks but to many places in Charlotte for food not saying I wouldn't go back but just not past 7 for dinner.",

    "text": "So excited about all the new bars and restaurants in uptown, and by far most excited about Essex right now! It's been open for not too long and i've already been there enough times to have tried 80% of their menu! The best part about this place is the vibe & ambiance, followed by the food and drinks! I've only ever been here on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always packed and lively. It's a good place for a small group or a large group.. as long as you're not looking for a quiet and serene restaurant experience :) my favorite drink - simply sage martini! The G & T is nice too, and so is the margarita. If you're looking for a sweeter cocktail, try the Mediterranean mojito. I've noticed they have a pretty neat red wine offering too. Let's talk about the food, shall we! I haven't had anything yet I didn't like.. but if I had to recommend some of my faves - the warm Brussels Caesar, Korean BBQ shrimp tacos, gambas, calamari, lamp chop lollipops! The butter chicken is pretty good too, and the garlic naan - well that's really good... it's more garlic bread than naan, but it tastes great with the butter chicken!! :) If you're in the mood for flatbreads, you can't go wrong with any of their choices. Here's to hoping that they continue to maintain the quality of their food and drinks and fab atmosphere!",

I have a new fave drink the Fall Blossom.  I had to try the Korean Bbq Shrimp tacos and they did not disappoint. How the pack so much flavor in a small taco. They are really messy to eat but I enjoyed every bite.  The best was the Apple Kale salad.  It was hands down the best salad I have ever had. Don't expect a bitter bite from the kale this salad almost tasted like a slaw. Glad I followed reviews and tried this place.",

Service was great... they seem to work like a well-oiled machine, despite being so new.  We both really liked the atmosphere. They have a pretty nice wine selection, and enough enticing menu choices that we had a tough time deciding. Yirleana was very helping answering questions that we had. We chose the Tuna Poke Tacos, the Beef Sopecitos, Korean BBQ Shrimp Tacos, and the Chorizo Stuffed Fried Olives.   The Tuna Poke Tacos and Beef Sopecitos were my favorites (fabulous!), but everything was also very good. I would have liked a crisp, rather than soft, taco texture for the Shrimp Tacos, but that's just a personal choice and I still really enjoyed them. Next time I will attempt to try something new, but the Tuna and Beef were so good that it may be a challenge not to order them again!",

However, after placing our drink order, we waited 35 minutes to receive them. 35 minutes to make a few gin and tonics and  2 dirty martinis. We didn't even get so much as an update from our server until we asked him what the deal was when he came around to fill our waters for the 3rd time.  There was no visit from management and all we were told was the \"bar was backed up\". The restaurant was not at full capacity and the tables around us were not sat. This was completely unacceptable and unfortunately, the second time something like this has happened. I will not be returning. Apparently I should have made a reservation for my drink to make it to the table as well.",

    "text": "I rarely ever post reviews, but I feel strongly this one is necessary. I waited tables for many years and understand that every experience isn't perfect, things get busy/stressful and that it's hard work. With that being said, I know bad service, training and poor overall organization of an establishment when I see it.  My family and I dined at Essex last night for dinner (table of 8). I've eaten at Essex 3 different times and sat at the bar w/one person during 'off hours'. My experiences all three times were good, hence the family dinner reservation. Last night's dining experience was sub-par at best. After being sat, we waited ~ 20 minutes before anyone took our drink orders or even came to the table. The waitress didn't address the whole table once...hi, I'm your server, has anyone been here before, here are recommendations, etc. It took another 20 minutes to receive our drinks or have anyone come back to the table. The waitress then brought a wrong drink order after I watched it being said correctly to her. Two more were made/entered incorrectly.   Because of how long we'd already been sat and the long amount of time it took to just receive our drinks, we decided to order everything at the same time. We specified 3 appetizer orders to be placed first (this should be obvious when you state, 'We'd like to start with these 3 appetizer orders before our dinner.'). We followed with our dinner orders. I would expect the waitstaff to mention here if the system for delivering food is different than that.   This is where lack of organization and poorly run 'system' became horribly apparent. The food started coming out in terrible sequence. Two people got their dinners first after people/runners shouted out what the meal was to the table. Then a long lag time...no other plates delivered for ~10-15 min. This continued in 3-4 more phases with 1-2 people getting their meal followed by a longer than acceptable wait time between each. The appetizers were delivered dispersed throughout the dinner orders arriving to the table...one coming next to last. My dad's dinner was finally delivered at the very, very end after the whole table had their food for some time. After all this, the waitress never came back to check in, see how the meals were, if we needed anything else. This is basic etiquette no matter where you are waiting.   We had to waive her down to place additional drink orders. Then, she only checked with half the table. I had to stop her as she walked away & before she disappeared for another 20 min to ask that she take orders from the other half of the table! We originally planned to get desserts & after-dinner drinks. After this ridiculously disappointing experience, we got the check and moved to a different restaurant instead hoping to have a more positive experience to end the night.  I will also note that it's 'restaurant week' and dining out during this week is busy. I am still unaware, however, if Essex even participates in this week?? If so, we certainly weren't told that at the beginning of our night at Essex. If so, we also never saw a 'restaurant week' menu or were informed of the menu/deals specific to that.   Very, very disappointing experience for an anticipated fun, relaxing and rare night out for the whole family. ***************************  Ashley, in response to your comment below...we dined at Essex on Saturday, Jan. 21st. Our reservations were for 8 people at 8pm.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner last night and unfortunately, we were very disappointed in the experience. After taking our order of two starters (hummus and falafel), our server disappeared for 30 minutes during which time we sat with empty drinks and plates. Finally, a different waitress came over and tried to drop the check at our table (not her fault- obviously a miscommunication on our original servers part). We told her we hadn't even ordered our dinner yet and we wanted another round of drinks. The drinks then took at least 10 minutes to come out and it was not a busy night, but having worked in a restaurant before, we decided not to make a big deal of it. THEN the vegetable samosas came out and the vegetables were ice cold and still frozen! At that point, we were done and just wanted to leave. We asked to see the manager; he apologized and took the frozen vegetable samosas off the bill, and my husband's lamb which he didn't even get to eat. Somehow, our bill was still over $100 (2 rounds of drinks, hummus and falafel), and we left starving. As I mentioned, I was a waitress for many years and understand that things happen, but it's the manager's job to make things right. Taking only 2 items off our bill- the two things we weren't able to eat- is not an acceptable solution. A round of drinks would have gone a long way. We won't be back and will certainly not recommend this restaurant to family or friends.",

    "text": "I have been debating since Saturday on this rating and came to the conclusion that my Essex experience was A-OK. Since I work next door, I was hoping to really really love this place. I think we will be back for drinks at the bar, but may pass on dining next time (for a bit atleast).  My husband and I came for dinner with another couple on Saturday after doing the 4th Ward Holiday Home Tour. Probably was around 8pm and we were seated immediately. The setup and decorations are so cute. I love the Edison light bulb look for lighting. I passed this former fountain space every day before Essex was built and am just shocked with what they were able to do with this corner space!  I have heard that the mixed drinks here were outstanding and I can not wait to go back to try some. However, after looking at the bottled wine prices, both couples decided to go with a bottle of wine. I appreciate restaurants that have retail prices for wine bottles! My husband and I decided on a Sangiovese, which was delish.  We started with the Mediterranean trio dip and the gnocchi. The dip was nicely presented. The hummus and babaganoush were just ok but the tomato dip was absolutely fantastic. The gnocchi was pretty good as well.....I am a slightly harsh critic of Italian dishes, as my large Italian family makes pasta from scratch. Thought the gnocchi held up to standards :). After these starters, we ordered the following: -Short rib ravioli - Pretty good. Nothing stellar. Weirdly enough, i liked the veggies in this dish better than the ravioli -Tuna tartar- Winner! I love tuna tartar and this one was super tasty. A bit spicy but the chips cut that spice some.  -Asian steak - Good flavor in the steak. The best part of this dish was the puree under the steak! Amazing flavors -Shrimp and grits - This was pretty good. I liked that their was also sausage in it. Grits were very creamy  While we had some decent food, here are some areas that changed this review from a 4/5 star to a 3: -Service- Basically non-existent. I am not a needy customer. However, our waiter forgot to put in our first two items. Thus, we waited about 45 minutes from when we got wine to when we got food. Normally, that would have been ok, but this girl was hangry major and it was just a dip we ordered! He thought we were perusing the menu and we thought he was just waiting for our food. Didn't really apologize for forgetting to put the food in. Once the food started coming out, it was steady and as expected for a tapas place. It was fairly bare minimum service.  -Noise level- I recognize they are trying to go for a hip restaurant vibe but it was so freaking loud in there that I couldn't hear across the table, much less beside me. Between the loud music and all the people, it was just insane. I'm totally great with that loud atmosphere vibe but this felt above and beyond the normal loudness. I know this sounds whiny to complain about but if I can't even hear you from right across from me, that's a problem. -Price to Value- Been to many tapas restaurants in this city and I thought that everything was priced a bit higher than others. I am totally great with paying higher prices, if I think it is worth the value. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the value matches the price.   Maybe my expectations were a bit higher. Regardless, I think this is a place in Uptown that everyone should check out cause I feel that, once some kinks are worked out, this place will shine.",

    "text": "Ok, I'm disappointed to have to write yet another disappointing review for a new spot. C'mon Charlotte, please don't make me stay home all the time.  It's been awhile since I went out. Heard about this place, so my friend and I went for food and drinks. It was late (maybe 10ish). We sat at a high top by the bar. We were greeted by waiter - he was enthusiastic if anything. Hear me out... if I have to pay $10+ for a drink, $30+ for entree, and $10-17 for a small plate, I will come with a level of expectation on BOTH service & food. I will expect my server to know Patron XO is NOT to be used as a liquor choice if my mixer is club soda (lucky for me, it wasn't my drink). and I will expect to be informed BEFORE the kitchen closes in case I want more food (instead of that the kitchen has closed, and hope for us to tab out).  Food was actually pretty good. We had the rock shrimp ($15) and the churrasco ($15). The shrimp dish was really good, especially the naan which was great to soak up the garlic olive oil. The beef dish was tiny and an odd use of alfredo sauce on potato. And that was it, that's all we got to eat. I would have ordered more dishes upfront if I knew... and trust me, it led to an epic downfall as alcohol kept flowing.   So here goes another new \"hip\" place that deliver a lukewarm experience on a night out.",

We asked to sit on the patio (not sure if we just got there at a good time, but there were plenty of seats outside) and we were immediately seated.   The drinks were strong (major plus), and the food truly was delicious. Our favorites were the veal meatballs (the best and most tender meatballs I've ever had), and the lamb sliders (this was extremely delicious, you won't go to many burger places that serve a burger as flavorful and perfectly cooked as this one).  The service was quite slow at the beginning, and our waiter assured us that it was busier inside. However a drunk driver had been pulled over next to the restaurant and it seemed every single waiter kept coming outside to stand and watch (that really affected my experience and it was extremely unprofessional). I guess they weren't as busy as or waiter said if they all had time to do this?  Overall it was a great experience, I think they just need to train their staff better.",

    "text": "Six of us ladies went to the Essex Bar and Bistro in uptown Charlotte before a concert in the arena.  We arrived at 5:50 pm and were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress, Sapphire, introduced herself and took our drink order.  Nice, BUT it was downhill from there.   The food was decent but they ran out of three items we wanted to order and their sushi chef was out for the evening???  So no sushi.  We ordered several flatbreads, lobster mac and cheese, calamari and Essex dip trio.  Again, all good but nothing to write home about.  Noise level was extremely high, not so much from people talking, but from the music that they were piping in.  Asked if the music could be turned down....no, the owner likes it that way.  The wait for our dinners was longer than usual and when we told the manager that we were trying to make a concert at the arena, he said with an attitude, \"so is everyone else\".  Not the answer I expected.  Our waitress came over and gave us the impression that the manager was buying us a second round of drinks (4 of us understood and heard her) because of the delay with our food.   We thought that was a nice gesture.  However, when the bill came, the second round was charged and when we questioned that, we received a blank stare and the bill was not adjusted.   So bottom line, with so many restaurants to chose from, we won't be going back.",

That is the day I made my reservation for the brunch to be at 5 pm. I'm never coming back here. There are other restaurants in charlotte with great buffets and better service.

Unfortunate as we were introducing this restaurant to friends of ours who were celebrating anniversary. The service was just not good. After our first order of tapas came out our server did not visit us one time to ask how the food was, not did she ask us if we wanted to order more food or drinks or deserts. Our waters were completely dry and never got a refill.  It took us multiple times to flag her down to ask for check.  And one more thing. We made reservations on open table and it asks if you are celebrating anything special. Don't ask if you aren't going to acknowledge it in any way.  Food was still great but unfortunately a terrible server experience can make a lasting impression.",

The beef in the steamed buns was extremely chewy and tough, and the short rib sliders had the densest, dryers buns imaginable. They would be better off with softer brioche buns. The charcuterie needs more variety in texture such as Brie & blue cheese. Not just a couple of different hard, dry cheese cubes.",

    "text": "I've been to Essex twice now, and really enjoyed both experiences.  The first time, I went with a group of ladies from my book club for our holiday dinner.  The second, my husband and I went during Restaurant Week.  I've tried many of their dishes and some are absolutely repeatable.  Let me try to summarize the highlights -   Favorites * Butter chicken - Their chicken is tender, and the sauce is rich and delicious.  Plus, the bread they serve with it is AMAZING. * Warm brussel sprout caesar salad - Gosh, this salad is good!  I daresay it's my favorite version of a caesar salad EVER. * Asian style skirt steak - Our server recommended this, and I'm glad we tried it!  I don't typically like steak, but this preparation was tasty, and it melted in your mouth.     Other impressions   * Gambas Al Ajillo - This dish is served with plenty of rock shrimp.  The sauce was good, but in comparison to the skirt steak and butter chicken, I'd probably forgo this the next time.  Psst - it's also served with their delicious bread. * Lobster tacos - This was my biggest (really, the ONLY)  disappointment.  The tacos needed more sauce, and the lobster was overcooked.   * Bang Bang Grouper - This was similar to Bonefish's version.  My husband liked this better than me.  I just found it a bit too saucy for my liking. * Kale and Apple Salad - Normally, this would be my go-to salad.  But after having the brussel caesar, I'd always choose the latter over this one. * Essex dip trio and Mediterranean dip trio - Both were good, and perfect for sharing.  I do want to try the tuna poke tacos and shrimp and grits on our next visit.  It's going to be so hard determining which of our favorites to forgo though!  I did find the drink menu to be a bit lacking.  I prefer martinis and cocktails with vodka, and there weren't many options.  The drinks I tried on both occasions (I honestly cannot remember them) were just ok.  Service was great on both occasions.  Especially considering we had a big table during one of the visits.  In terms of atmosphere, Essex has many areas for seating, but the restaurant is both lively and loud.  Keep this in mind if you are looking to have an intimate conversation.    The food and service were so good that  I'll definitely be back!",

Food: I have tried quite a few dishes on the menu and have enjoyed all of them. The dip trio is a bit underwhelming as a starter though, and the guac isn't that fresh. However, the churrasco (steak and potatoes with alfredo sauce and chimichurri) is always a favorite! The butter chicken is also very well done. The rock shrimp is pretty good but I was hoping for more from the dish. The bang bang grouper is awesome.  Drinks: I can't remember the specific drinks I've had but I remember them all being tasty. They also have some mainstream cocktails (like a moscow mule) on tap which I think is a cool feature.  Service: Here's the not so great part. The first time we went I remember having great service. Second two times - not as much. The second time we were celebrating our engagement with a group of friends and we had reservations. The server literally couldn't get my drink order right and I ended up with 3 drinks (I mean... not a bad thing but also bad service) in front of me. The third time, I was with 3 other people and we almost missed a concert because of how slow it was (and we gave ourselves plenty of time).  I guess my conclusion would be that maybe the experience would be better on an off-night, and that the food is good but not \"blow you away\" good.",

As a result, the service was extremely spotty throughout the entire meal.  Essex is a beautiful space with a large, open patio and interior dining area. I met up with a group of fellow Yelp elites as we had a reservation (six in total). We each placed our orders and waited for the food to arrive. While waiting, I took note of how extremely loud it was. We were seated at the very front and I had to shout across the table and ask for things to be repeated because of the high noise level. When I got up to use the bathroom, I noticed how much quieter it is/was, the further you go back.  The orders were brought out in a staggered fashion. We all ordered salads as the first course, however, they didn't all come out at the same time. Then our second courses came, one by one, not all at once, and so on.  As for my choice of food:  First course - greek salad. Nothing really of note about the salad. I asked the waitress for no feta, and after waiting around, the salad came out with, you guessed it, feta. I ate around it.  Second courses - shrimp and scallop ceviche and lobster tacos. The ceviche was beautifully presented and tasted very light and fresh. The lobster tacos were extremely small and fried a little too hard. I was not a fan of those. Not much flavor and not at all worth their normal menu price of $19.  Dessert - tiramisu. Not a typical tiramisu, in that no real layers of ladyfingers were to be found and not much coffee-flavoring either. This was more of a tiramisu pudding and I don't believe it's on their normal dessert menu which should tell you something.  It's always disappointing when a meal you've been looking forward to is marred by unsatisfactory service and subpar food. Restaurant Week is always a great time to find out how efficiently a restaurant can run things and the Essex staff seemed quite overwhelmed and confusingly unprepared. The place is located right in the heart of Uptown, I'm sure Friday/Saturday nights are a nightmare. Essex promotes itself as a 'premium craft bar\" but I couldn't find anything premium about the food nor service.  Major tip about parking - park in the Auto Park parking deck on 260 S Church St and the host/hostess will validate your parking. That little thing was the best part of my Essex experience.  Like I said, I plan to go back and will hopefully be able to report back differently.",

It was SO delicious that everyone wanted to eat all of my remaining sauce with the naan bread they give you.   It was a great night but, unfortunately, we didn't get the best service. Two Shrimp & Grits needed to go out our table but the server decided one out of the two Shrimp & Grits plates he was holding was going to another table. Our server apologized but she didn't do much about it. We were all done eating our plates when the last Shrimp & Grits finally got to our table. I believe the service could've been way better at Essex but I am willing to give it another chance since their food was so incredible.",

But, turns out that the menu was pre-selected. We were a good sized group - but they shoved us in a tiny room with loud music, which made it pretty much impossible to hear anything. We ordered drinks and it seemed to take forever for the salad course to arrive. There was no bread delivered. The main course was two huge hunks if chicken cooked in chopsticks. Served alongside two slices of potato, some sliced peppers and onions. No grains to be found anywhere. I left hungry, care back to my room and ate some left over pizza. I'm sure the food isn't half bad - but what they prepared for our group was just a few small steps above overpriced wedding food.",

We sat outside which was perfect for our group-but inside looked large and beautiful as well.   Ordered the Essex dip trio, kalbi beef, churrasco, and Asian style skirt steak-all of which were amazing. Small tapas style plates but flavor was on point.   Our waiter, Robert, was very friendly and very helpful. Brought us out extra bread to try with our dips, different samples of new wines to try, etc. He went above and beyond and we really enjoyed having him as our waiter.",

Service was super friendly, but just a tad slow (and not crazy busy).. But I would definitely recommend this place to someone who is thinking of trying it!

    "text": "Slowest service ever and subpar food! Had to go to bar to order a glass of vodka for the Bloody Mary bar since the waiter wasn't interested in getting us a  second round. Both bartenders found this to be a difficult task. It literally took 3 people involved and three eye rolls (one of which was the manager we found out later). First entree brought to the table was a breakfast pizza. The next entree was French toast which came about 10 min later. Another 15 minutes go by before any other entrees came out. We asked for the manager who was also in no hurry to come out ....shocker, it was one of the bartenders who had just rolled his eyes in the back of his head. We complained about how long it was taking and the manager responded very harshly with \"we only ordered 45 minutes ago\" I then responded with it would have been nice to have everything at once. Manager then said that he could have left the two items that had already come out in the window (keep in mind these items came out about 15 min apart from each other). There were a total of 6 tables in the restaurant at the time. Even worse than the slow service was the ridiculous response of the manager who never apologized and had such an unprofessional attitude. Still another 10 minutes after complaining we had one person who had not received their French toast and another that had not received their waffle fries. At this point we had a couple that had been finished for quite some time, several that were finishing up and still a couple that were waiting for an entree and a side.  By the time we finished paying we were still waiting on the waffle fries. They finally come out in their to go container and low and behold they were potatoes, not waffle fries. We told the waiter right away and he said they don't have waffle fries. This was so bad it was almost comical had it not ruined our day. We pointed out to him on the menu where one of the side dishes listed as clear as can be is waffle fries. At this point we just wanted out of this dump as soon as we could get out.  Not one apology, not one item removed from the bill- just crappy food with unbelievably horrible service l.  Awful way to end all star weekend and our visit to Charlotte.",

I believe this restaurant is on my top 4 favorite restaurants in Charlotte that include Soul, Workman's Friend and The Fig Tree.   The short rib ravioli is very rich but great to split between a few people.  Calamari was tasty along with the butter chicken and the churrasco (chimichuri steak skewer).  Flavors were very nice and great atmosphere.",

The service was good but my friend and I felt very rushed towards the end of our meal. One plus was that the hostess was able to hold our table bc we were trying to find parking--major annoyance--tip: Park at the First Citizens garage bc at some point is free--we left around 11pm and it was free and. A short walk.  We ordered the Churrasco and it was ok, the kale and Ceasar was not good, and lobster taco was messy and lobster that was tempura fried was soggy. The best thing we had was butter chicken and ironically it tasted very authentic. Safe to say most of the food we had was not that great and I would not come back. The cocktail menu was meh...some of their drinks had egg white as an ingredient and I think they should have better cocktail choices than what they include on menu.  Give it a try and see what you think but I don't plan to be back. I've had better tapas/drinks than this place. Hopefully they will change out some items and turn up the air--and side note we saw two couples leave after they sat down for 5 mins bc it was soooooo damn warm in there.",

It was one of my friends 30th birthday and we had the worst experience ever. The first mistake was the fact It took about 25 mins to get a class of Pinot Grigio while others got there complex cocktails. Next was the fact they ran out of the item that I ordered but handled the issue absolutely horrible. Everyone had got there meal and TWENTY MINUTES later they tell us they ran out. I understand this happens but you could've told us immediately after running out rather than us waiting and  twiddling our thumbs for the ONE item we always come to get. The third issue was the fact that we told the waiter it was my friends 30th birthday and then they said they don't do anything for birthdays and the fact that they are going to charge someone for it. After the previous issues, the LEAST you could do is comp and desert. It is pathetic that this happened and you have ruined my experience with this restaurant.

We ordered drinks and appetizers. Another 15 minutes went by before we had our drinks. We ordered as soon as the drinks arrived. There was dirty silverware found on the table. The appetizers came out rather quickly. The next batch of food came out and the appetizer plates were not cleared. Everything was left on the table, including the menus. We had to ask to see a desert menu, the huge happy 40th birthday balloon must not have been a good indicator. The desert arrived along with a stack of plates and spoons. Some of the plates were chipped and dirty. I went to throw the plate away and a male server grabbed it from me, before I could explain it was dirty & chipped. He was rather rude in his demeanor and grabbed it from my hands.  We sat for another 20 minutes waiting for the server and we asked for our checks. I've been writing this review while waiting for our server to return so I can give her my credit card.  The food was okay, it was  a bit over-seasoned. It was also over priced. The restaurant was very loud and it was hard to hear each other talk.  I will not return to Essex.

Granted most of them were appetizers but after ordering a few I was full! Their service was awesome as well.  Kim V did a great job in keeping the order as requested.  I can't have parmesan cheese since it contains animal rennet and its not suitable for vegetarians. Luckily their stuffed mushrooms arent pre-made so I was able to have the mushrooms without parmesan cheese. The first order came out with the cheese but she sent it back to have it remade without it. I couldn't have asked for a better waitress! I look forward to coming back to enjoy Essex again.",

    "text": "Four stars for the food, decor, and atmosphere at dinner. As a vegetarian, I'm not generally a huge fan of tapas style as it tends to be very meat heavy, and I don't particularly like splitting a large bill when I've had a salad and a side dish. Essex has plenty of options though; I particularly liked the gnocchi and the brussels sprout caesar. The fried cauliflower was pretty good, but too much curry for my taste (I would prefer a sweet & sour) and was missing the candied pecans. The brussels sprouts dish was also missing the home made croutons. The dip trio was also good, but it was a little odd to eat guacamole on a buttery baguette, and the menu did say that it was to be served with naan bread. The short rib ravioli seemed to be a hit. On the downside, a lot of the dishes, as well as the cocktails, are overpriced. The zucchini chips sound good, but am I really going to pay $14 for a small plate of fried zucchini? Or $12 for a side of hummus? The cocktails were fairly tasty, but also fairly weak. And at $14, I expect a little more. The ingredients currently on offer are a little pedestrian. The cocktail list displayed online is not reflective of what they are currently making; I would be much more interested in the old menu.",

My girlfriend and I get there to find out the menu we wanted to try won't be being served, instead because of the Easter holiday it's a breakfast buffet. Besides the fact we were disappointed, the food on the buffet just wasn't very good. Leaving two stars just because of how friendly and attentive our waitress was. Maybe one day I can update this review. It would have been nice to have seen anything online about an Easter Sunday buffet. Quite a bit of money spent for lousy food.",

For lunch I was told the Indian Butter chicken was awesome. I ordered that. It comes with a piece of Naan bread shaped (and almost the size of) a baseball bat! So great. The dish is just a large helping of chicken in sauce. Perfect lunch size. And the sauce...well...I used the entire baseball bat of naan and a couple of extra pita slices to mop up all of the sauce. Many at the table got the Brussells Sprout salad and we thrilled with their choice. Looked awesome.",

I was very surprised because typically when you're located in the heart of downtown, you don't have to be amazing to have a full house, it's the location that will keep the people flowing in. But with Essex, I would find my way there: beautiful atmosphere, food presentation and great flavor. It's small plates from around the world, you can't classify it as only Mediterranean because they really do have an almost odd assortment of dishes.   We ordered the butter chicken curry which is served with a bread-stick looking piece of naan and is delicious, creamy and flavorful. We also ordered the brussels sprout salad, a very large portion and served warm not chilled. Tuna tartar tacos come with a side of seaweed/cilantro slaw and of course the bang bang shrimp which packs a powerful punch of heat. We even ordered dessert because everything was so delicious and were not disappointed with the strawberry, mango, vanilla tort [wasn't a \"must get dessert good\" but I'm much more of a salty than sweet person]. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Essex, it was truly delicious and they're really doing it right in multiple ways. I'd definitely recommend it for a group of people (it's easy to make a reservation on Open Table) or for a date.",

Warm Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad. This dish is amazing and I am always craving it. The Brussels Sprouts are shredded and dressed with their amazing dressing. This is a must try for sure! 2. Essex Burger as well. This comes with pork belly on top of the burger meat. The flavors are so delicious together.  3. Kalbi Beef. The combinations and flavors of this dish are a perfect combination. The parsnip puree brought the dish together.  4. Fried Cauliflower. The sauce for this dish is mesmerizing and compliments the food very well!  5. Coconut Curry Mussels. The sauce was creamy and delicious!",

Don't leave without ordering the Warm Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad or the Butter Chicken. For lunch, the Blackened Fish Tacos were delicious. This is mostly a small plates restaurant, which I've found can be pricy, but in this case completely worth it. The menu has a mix of Mediterranean and Indian foods. Again, the Butter Chicken is incredible, (you'll want to drink the sauce). Hummus and naan are also great if you're not too adventurous.

The front patio is a perfect setup for prime people watching.   The ambiance was very charming, kind of rustic, and warm. Not overly done...just enough.  I placed reservations for 10:30 on a Friday night via the OpenTable app. However, it wasn't really packed. Not really sure if this turnout is typical or if the chilly, breezy evening had anything to do with it.  Onto one of my biggest pet peeves with public establishments...questionable bathrooms!!! Essex's restrooms were clean and orderly, thank god! Public restrooms kind of gross me out...and it was a long evening...that would have been a tough, long ride home...just saying  My female waitress was very friendly and attentive. She had knowledge of the menu and was able to provide great recommendations. The bar and food orders were accurate and timely for both my company and I.  The Drinks? :  My company had a bottle of Yuengling. Not really the daring type just yet...he's getting there. However, I had ordered a Queen Scarlett. I'm glad that I did. That drink was absolutely delicious!!! The flavors blended very well together. You can feel the flavors on the front of your tongue, as well as the back. I had to take my time with this cocktail. Take a sip, look at the glass in astonishment, and take another sip. Kudos to the mixologists!!!  What I ordered: Korean BBQ Shrimp BBQ Tacos. If you are not familiar with that \"tapas style\" life, you will get your feelings hurt. But there wasn't any need to supersize these 3 delectable babies, because they were full of flavor and texture. Tapas is not meant to be scarfed down.  What my company ordered: Al Pastor Tacos w/o Guacumole. He enjoyed them as well. First time tapas eater...He still reverted back to his typical simple palate and asked for the homemade waffle fries. Another standout! And dare I say better than Chick-fil-A?! Just enough crunch, perfectly golden, fresh...  The price: The total bill came to $50.88, with tax. Little on the pricey side for some, but you're paying for the culinary experience. Personally, I found my life in the Queen Scarlett cocktail alone! To make a drink taste that good takes talent! lol  I am definitely plotting on my next Essex cocktail/food adventure. Next review, more pictures!",

Essex has one of the best deals for restaurant week in charlotte: soup or salad, two small plates and a dessert for $35. I started with the Greek salad which was pretty standard but good, and for my small plates I had the butter chicken and the pork buns.   The butter chicken had very good flavor and the \"naan\" breadstick was amazing! The chicken was a little drier than I would like but the sauce made up for it. The pork buns were also good with very thick cut pork belly and pickled vegetables, but I wasn't overly impressed with the actual buns (they were definitely not homemade, probably purchase frozen). The tiramisu was also very good! The perfect way to finish the meal. Some other favorites in the group were the poke tacos, bang bang grouper and the short rib ravioli.   Essex was a great choice for girls night and is probably even better when it's not restaurant week!  I will definitely be back.",

Went here this evening with the girl. Asked to be seated somewhere quiet. That apparently meant by the bathroom. Lovely. Zero ambience, all the sounds of the kitchen and the staff in the back room doing their side work. So not quiet and not pleasant. Ordered two signature drinks and the Essex Trio appetizer. Waitress asked if we wanted \"carrot and celery sticks and naan instead of just naan\". I said sure. She never mentioned an up-charge for the six pathetic sticks of celery and carrots, nor is it mentioned on the menu that it's an up-charge. The bill comes and sure enough it's $2 more. Clearly they're trying to be sneaky about this as it rings as a single line instead of the item on the menu with an extra charge added. When I brought it up our waitress said it was correct. I pointed out that she hadn't mentioned this and it's not in the menu. She then took my menu and looked at it in front of me. I'm not sure if that means she thinks I'm a liar or she doesn't know the menu, not good either way.   Moral of the story, if you want to pay $50 for two ok drinks and an appetizer and have the staff try to sneak extra charges onto your bill then go here. If you want value for your money and appreciate not being deceived then take your $$ elsewhere.",

    "text": "If you're looking for some of the most DELICIOUS tapas in town, THIS is the place to be.  I came here for the first time with a couple of my friends and we ordered a few plates to share. I've wanted to try this place for the LONGEST so I was really excited to finally get the chance.  Our server was really nice and attentive. She was able to accommodate our needs, answer our questions and give us some recommendations.  The Kale and Apple salad was SO crisp and delicious! The kale was tender and easy to chew, the candied nuts added a sweet crunch in addition to the apple, and the dressing cut through the bitterness of the greens so perfectly. I could eat a bowl of that salad <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fevery.freaking.day&s=3688007562661844c17a1f517b1e32ce796774128f5c17e16d42330818d42157\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">every.freaking.day</a>.  The calamari was very flavorful. The sauce that they toss the calamari in reminded us of buffalo sauce. Not sure if that was the goal but we definitely tore it up!!  The lamb kefta sliders were okay. I thought they were dry and needed a bit more seasoning. I think a yogurt sauce would pair better than the chopped onions and tomatoes.   The short rib flatbread was the FIRST plate that we finished! From the time it touched the table we wasted no time digging in. The ricotta was light, the meat was tender and the overall composition of flavors was harmonious. I don't think I've ever had a flatbread so delicious in my life.  The butter chicken was nice- very tender and juicy, and we liked how the \"naan\" was made like a baguette. If you're a fan of  curry then this will be right up your alley.  The Pork Buns were good, but once you dip them in that schechuan sauce??? PERFECTION. The pork belly was tender, the bun was soft and it surprisingly didn't get soggy because we left them sitting there for a while before we started eating them.  Our least favorite was the Gambas al ajillo(rock shrimp). It looked beautiful, but it was lacking flavor. A little bit more salt would've been good and maybe even some more garlic. The oil had little-to-no flavor at all, but the shrimp was cooked nice and the bread was good.  ORDER THE KALBI BEEF.  This dish is so absolutely tender and harmonious you'll be fiending for the last bite! The kimchi was okay-it wasn't  traditional kimchi so that threw us for a loop, but the parsnip puree was smooth and FULL of flavor. It got to the point where  we were literally scraping the plate clean!  All in all, I will definitely be coming back  with more friends to indulge in another deliciously satisfying tapas feast.",

When she brought this up to management, they told her something to the effect of \"No one in the kitchen has hair like this - and it looks like your friend's.\"  Really?  First of all, I know the character of my friend and they would never do something so shady.  Secondly, is this really the way an \"upscale\" restaurant should handle this type of situation?  No.  The proper way is to say you're sorry, take the food back, get another hairless plate and comp it and some drinks.  I had enjoyed Essex in the past, but can assure you I won't be back and will recommend that anyone I know avoids this place in the future.",

She just needs to be more attentive. If she's not when it's not even busy at all, I can't imagine how she is when it is busy. I read other reviews about service being bad and I thought since they weren't busy then there's no way it can be slow but proved me wrong. Like I said food was tasty, but the portion isn't worth the money. I'll only maybe come back for restaurant week where the portion would be worth the price.",

We ordered drinks from the bar and an appetizer & 15 minutes later our appetizer appeared but still no drinks. We are then told that the dinner menu is tapas style & to order 2 entrees per person. We ordered Korean Shrimp BBQ tacos which I had at lunch and they were good, the Al Pastor tacos, Shmarma Pita & chicken salad. After waiting, we were told they were sold out of the Shmarma Pita. The tacos arrived and there were 3 tiny tiny not even taco sized items. They were basically two bites per taco and priced at $13-$15 per entree. At lunch, it's $11.95 for 3 tacos and a generous side Greek salad which is very filling. After spending almost $30 for 6 tiny tacos, I'm thinking we won't return for dinner. The chicken salad was a larger portion and very tasty. All in all, we spent $92 including tip for dinner & it definitely wasn't worth the money spent! There are plenty of better dining spots in downtown!!",

We barely got the second round before it was time for the check. We also realized halfway thru the game that we never got the shrimp dish that we ordered and I'm pretty sure we paid for it.

Service was a tiny bit slow but I won't knock them for that because of the volume of people eating on V-day at 7 pm.  Tables were super close together and it was hard to sit without touching someone from another table, let alone getting out to go to the restroom.  Portions are meant to be shared, so they're not huge.  I split an appetizer (Mediterranean dip trio) and bottle of wine with a friend, plus the Asian style skirt steak entree and I left perfectly satsified, not stuffed.  Throughout the night, staff attempted to deliver an order to our table that none of us ordered (no fewer than 5 times).  They may not have their table numbers memorized but it was a weird mixup that kept happening.  The dips weren't the best I've had and I probably wouldn't spend $13 on it again, but the naan it came with was delicious and it staved off my hunger while waiting for the main course.  Also had a bite of the Churrasco which was delicious and another friend got the Korean BBQ shrimp tacos (super small portion).  Pretty place and probably really good service on a normal night.  I would come back but keep in mind you probably won't spend less than $40-50 a person to fill your stomach.",

Didn't say anything, ask how the food was--nothing. Just slammed it and walked away. The remainder of the time, she was pretty curt. Expected a lot more from my once favorite place in charlotte.

I am fairly certain they have a discus driven British bull dog wall art next to the bar, but some folks in my friend circle are not as sure on that part!! The menu has some definite British favorites for indian food. The butter chicken is excellent with a unique twist on Naan bread. The best way I can describe the bread is a ciabatta texture that tastes like Garlic Naan but is shaped like a long baguette. The coconut curry mussels are absolutely fantastic. Perfect blend of tangy spicy curry meets the mild sweetness of coconut with the  nice savory flavor of mussels. The Pablo crusted samosas are just the right level of spicy for even someone who enjoys mild indian flavors to savor. The drinks are pretty good, the Essex Smash is unique. I could do with a more bold bitters flavor, but that might make the drink too specific and probably closer to one deep toned Old Fashioned. Now here comes the reason I rank this place 4 stars. We were in a relatively large group of 15. However folks were ordering in waves and would have expected a reasonable cadence of order fulfillment, especially for drinks. The staff were super friendly and that helps. However, this place could have probably made about 400-500 bucks more from our table if they were more attentive to the drinks. I will be back for more of the mussels and butter chicken for sure!",

We had a pleasant dining experience, sitting at the tables directly in front of the bar, and had a waiter who handled our large party of ladies with discriminating palates fairly well. I actually fell in love with the lamb sliders and the sophisticated atmosphere, even though the restaurant is a bit loud. Several days later, I called and inquired about availability for space to book a party of 20+ ladies for a return visit in Dec. The lady who answered the phone, and responded to my questions was pleasant and friendly, and informed me that she would pass the message on to the appropriate person, and that they could call me back in 2-3 days with details. I told her that I was excited to hear back, as we really enjoyed the restaurant, and were looking forward to returning and bringing more of our girlfriends. Fast forward over a week later-guess what, no return call! Either the communications within the organization are lacking, or there is little regard for paying customers who are interested in returning, and bringing MORE customers in. Without the negative experience after my phone call, with no follow up, I would have given a top star rating.",

    "text": "We ate at Essex pre Justin Timberlake concert and it was super crowded. We had a reservation and sat right away, but it took a little while for a server to approach us. Honestly, the restaurant was completely overbooked so service was slow. Hostesses were seating very large tables (two separate tables of 12 and another of 8 right next to us) so we felt really bad for our poor server trying to handle all of it. It truly wasn't his fault.  Despite being crazy crowded, the food came out very quickly and was delicious. The bang bang grouper was hands down our fave along with the brussel caesar. The flatbread also delicious and the lobster tacos.   Plenty of food with those 4 dishes for two girls to be full. Great cocktail menu and wine list. Very reasonable for a nice, quick bite pre concert and steps away from the spectrum.   I'd go back!",

Our waiter brought out waters and recommended some different items on the menu.  After ordering we waited a while for our food.  For some reason all of the entree salads were brought out but no one else's meals were brought out.  This was REALLLLLYYYYYY awkward for a work lunch because those of us with our entree salads waited to eat.  I had to talk to the hostess to find our waiter to bring out the rest of our food .  It sucked and was really embarrassing because I set up the reservations and picked the place.   Someone came to our table and said \"sorry we split your ticket up and our kitchen is backed up.\"  They didn't offer any appetizers for those waiting forever for their food.    The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because my Brussel sprout Caesar salad was delicious even after sitting for 15 minutes waiting for everyone else to get their food.",

We recently had a LATE night dinner here after an Ugly Sweater Party where there where no Vegan/Vegetarian friendly dishes and I was starved. Since switching over to Vegan it's been hard to go out to enjoy dinner as a lot of restaurants in Charlotte aren't vegan friendly. I find joy in cooking and meal prepping but who doesn't want to go out once in a while. I personally due to this fact would just provide 2 stars since there are only like 2-3 options I could indulge with modifications from the menu. However my husband isn't Vegan and he highly recommends this place as he always enjoy his land and sea dishes so I averaged out the Stars to 4.  My husband FAV dishes so far  - Beef sliders  - Bang Bang Grouper  - Shrimp in Garlic and butter   Items I've had that were yummy  - Beet and Kale salad  - Vegetable Samosa   I'll say give them a try plus they are on OpenTable which we LIVE BY for reservations. The scenery here is also very Trendy and nice. There is plenty of seating and comfy booths which we opt for each visit. The bartenders make the Non-Alcoholic Ginger Beer from scratch and it's always yummy.  Parking is the interesting part, with the cold temps the parking that is validated by Essex is pretty far which at the lot next to Ink and Ivy which is about 2-3 blocks away. If your lucky which we were our LATE night visit you can get street parking on Tryon and walk to the entry.",

    "text": "This is likely the most challenging review to write. My opinions differ on the quality of the food and the service. While the food is exceptional, the service needs some serious work. As such, I am going to go with 3 stars.   My sister picked this restaurant to have my grandmothers 98th birthday dinner. The number of people attending was between 20-30., as such, we were seated in a semi- private room in the front of the restaurant. The reservation was set for 7pm. Admittedly, people continued to stroll in until about 8pm.  Of note, the majority of the patrons were coming from out of town, and had a difficult time with finding the location of this restaurant. I too struggled with finding parking. I ended up parking about 3 blocks away.   Since we did have a large group, the expectation was that we would have at least two servers. There was one male who was working our room. He appeared to be frazzled by the work he would have to do  for our group. He started out with taking drink orders. This took longer than it should have. It also was not done with errors. Several drinks were forgotten or took an extended amount of time to arrive. He proceeded with taking food orders. Another male did come in to assist with this effort. The food did come out fairly quickly.   Regarding the food, I enjoyed the dip trio and the eggplant flatbread, both exceeded my expectation. If the review was simply based on the taste of the food- it would be 5 stars! Everyone noted that they enjoyed their meal. I think the prices are fair given the portion sizes that you receive.  I must also mention that the server made a number of mistakes when bringing out tabs. Not to mention, gratuity in the amount of 22% was added to each bill. For the server to not be that efficient, he made out like a bandit on gratuity!!   The last area of concern was for the cake. I  purchased two cakes for my grandmothers celebration. The waiter brought out each cake separately, then the plates, then the knife to cut the cake. I just feel that if he had assistance, everything could have been done in one run.  It's as if staff lack any sense of urgency. As I was waiting on to go boxes, I saw at least 4 staff in the back just having general conversation. I guess that's why there was a delay in just about every service area.    Based on my experience, I do not feel that this restaurant is good for large groups. Due to the fact that the food was good,I will give them another try. likely with just one or two other people.",

The location is very cool in the middle of Uptown. The restaurant is covered in glass. The interior is quite dark and decorated in a typical upscale restaurant fashion.   We both ordered two plates. Our food came out so fast that it actually beat our drinks. I had the warm Brussels sprout Caesar salad and a flatbread. Both were absolutely delicious. The salad in particular blew my mind. Shaved Brussels ( I think steamed then broiled? Unclear how it is prepared) with a fantastically creamy dressing. And not a tiny portion! And, as expected, the flatbread was delicious.   We followed dinner with pumpkin cheesecake that was also great. Didn't QUITE have the crust-to-cheesecake ratio that I like, but I'm very picky about that so I'll let it slide.  This is a VERY busy spot. You definitely need a reservation. Your waiter may disappear for a bit (the space is larger than you might think) but other than a mistake on our bill, I don't really have complaints. Essex is a definitely an experience, so you should go for a special occasion (and make sure your wallet is ready for it, too).",

    "text": "I went in with a few friends on a week night. Apparently it was the same night as a concert at the Epicenter. It was the most horrific experience I've ever had at a restaurant in uptown Charlotte! The bartenders were extremely rude and only sat at the corner of the bar talking to one another; they decided my check wasn't high enough to get any type of service once I mentioned I was just grabbing a drink and waiting for friends before probably moving to a table. Once we sat down at a table on the patio, it took a full 11 minutes for a server to even greet us, and she was only picking up the table to help out, it wasn't even hers! She was extremely sweet and wonderful but obviously very over extended. The food took over 47 minutes to come out and all came out within about 8-13 minutes of each other. There were only 3 in my party. Two of the dishes were appetizers, so why it could take so long is beyond me. They tried to tell us that \"\"it's tapas, just order a bunch to share for the table\" and it would come out when ready, normally I'd be completely cool with that but 13 minutes between all three??? They were all put in together and I got my entree grouper dish before the other young lady in my party got her flatbread. Sounds like a poor excuse not to have any accountability in the kitchen and not have an expo on! Food was cold, greasy, and over saturated in tasteless sauces. Oh, did I mention the deceased BUG we found in the food as well?! By the time we left we were so disgusted we had to go somewhere else to eat and we're just completely done with the experience! Worst restaurant in uptown Charlotte, don't waste your time!",

Bottom line, this place had great food but I was specifically looking for a less expensive option for a random Wednesday night and wasn't thrilled that it wasn't made clear on the restaurant's website or Yelp description.",

For a 5:30 reservation started out by telling us there were out of a number of dishes. We got to my fourth selection on the wine list before we found something they had available. Food came out, no serving utensils, no one checked if we needed anything, no one came to ask if we wanted to order more dishes (it's all tapas style). Again, food was pretty good but the service is going to be the downfall. Oh, and on top of that, they added an automatic 20% tip...good thing because I wouldn't have left that much.",

Quick but dismissive and stood at the head of a long table to get everyone's order (annoying for those of us who had to yell at the server so he could hear us.  Hummus was good but what they call Naan isn't naan at all.  Shawarma Tacos were incredibly dry and too small to be considered a meal.  Greek salad was over dressed.  Chicken Bahn Mi was nothing like a Bahn Mi, it was a barbecue chicken sandwich with kimchee on it. Really terrible.  This was my second time giving this place a shot with very similar results. I will not be back. As a Chef, I can say that whoever is creating the dishes and menu has no idea what they're doing.",

Our favorites were the butter chicken and samosas! Did an awesome job on the curry side. The cauliflower was good but needed more sauce as the actual pieces didn't have much flavor. The short rib ravioli was pretty good and could be a small meal in itself. We ordered the pork buns but they didn't come out in steamed buns like the menu said, the server was nice and took them back since it's not what we were looking for. Also got the steak with the chimi. A few others got the mussels and the Brussels which they loved but I did not try. Overall i would come back but probably order less! 3 max 4 are needed for a couple.",

Last night my friends and I went in to dine and were sat by the hostess but waited over 15 minutes before we were served or ever greeted by our server. What makes it even worse is that I had to get up from my table, fine the hostess and inform her that we had not yet been greeted at all. A few minutes after letting the hostess know our server came to our table and began to serve us. I was honestly a little upset that it took me having to get up and say something to be served. I'm very curious how much longer we would've waited if I had not gotten up to say anything. So because of the service I am rating Essex a 2. My expectations were not fully met at all.",

I was just there for the weekend, so I'm not familiar with the nightlife, but I'm assuming most people are going to a club or going to a much fancier place, I'm not sure.

The vibe is nice, but the decor is kind of douchey, with the tattoo artwork and the artfully cropped photo of some beardy gentleman. The lighting is pleasant, and the patio is exceptional, but the furnishings seem strangely curated.   For me, Essex is typically a work lunch destination. I've found myself ordering the same thing on each of my visits -- the brussels sprout caesar salad -- because it's delicious, but it's also all I seem to be left with that's gluten free (omitting the croutons).   On my last visit, we ordered the hummus to share. I asked if we could get something GF to dip instead of pita. The hummus was brought out alone, and our server mentioned that some vegetables were on their way out for us to enjoy alongside. The hummus sat untouched in the center of the table for over ten minutes, only to have our vegetables handed over after our entrees were delivered. It made for very awkward pacing for our meal. While we were eating, our server dropped back by our table, presumably to check on our dishes, but instead shared with us that she was going on break, and that if we needed anything else we should tell her now. Another strange interaction.   I'd really like to rate Essex higher, but with so few GF options and questionable service, I have to land on three stars. But really, the caesar is delightful.",

    "text": "NOTE: THIS IS A LUNCH REVIEW, NOT A DINNER REVIEW  Today, I went with a group of colleagues from work for a lunch celebration today. One colleague was celebrating his 20th work anniversary so it was a special lunch and we chose Essex for the occasion.   Disappointment 1: I happily announced this momentous reason we were out to lunch to our server and it went completely unacknowledged. Was disappointed given just a little, \"Hey, that's great! Congratulations!\" would help make the experience something special for our colleague. Minor nit but the sign of a good server vs a not so good server...I was a server in my college days (a good one I might add).   Disappointment 2: When I ordered the salmon I specifically asked for it to be rare or medium rare at the most as I don't like it dry. Although fairly flavorful, it was dry when I received it. I ate 2/3 of it anyway as we did not have time to wait for another one to be cooked and I was hungry. I would have eaten all of it if prepared properly because I love salmon but I got tired of how dry it was so left a good amount on my plate. I shared my disappointment with the server and asked if he specifically told the kitchen I wanted rare to medium rare to which he responded with a simple, \"yes\". He also advised that the lunch kitchen staff was the \"B-Team\" and dinners were better than lunches generally. To that I told him, \"if I were the manager I would like to know that a customer did not get their lunch prepared how they asked it to be prepared, so please let the manager know.\" As I see it, this is an opportunity to improve the restaurant, after all.  Disappointment 3: When we got the check, there was no consideration (discount) given for the inadequate food preparation, nor did a manager stop by the table to \"make it right\" by simply apologizing or even acknowledging the complaint. I asked the server if he informed the manager and he said he had. I picked up the tab for the entire group and was not personally affected by the fact that no discount was offered since it was a celebratory event paid for by my company, but nonetheless I felt this was a missed opportunity for management to recover and make this group or each person in the group want to return. I shared that with the server as well. His reaction was to simply look at me. There was no acknowledgement or response.   With each of these interchanges, I was very respectful and conversant not demanding or rude in any way. This was an all around failure from a customer service perspective from the server, to the kitchen, to the management.   I will say this though, the ambience was cool. :=/",

With the tapas style dishes we were able to try many different items and it was delicious. We did the Mediterranean sauce plate with the naan which was very good. I was disappointed with the amount of naan compared to the sauces and then having to pay an extra $2 for each additional serving. We also had a dish from each of the additional sections of the menu and everything was tasty.   The wine selection is very good and they have decent wines that are not excruciatingly marked up. We did not ask but were put in a booth off to the side of the restaurant and it was the perfect spot for a date night. I highly recommend asking for a spot by the window or a booth.   We saw a small party of 8 celebrating an engagement at the table next to us and it seemed like the perfect spot for such an occasion. I would suggest this place for birthday dinners (with relatively small parties) or even small celebrations. I am definitely looking forward to the next time we go back.",

I see people sippin' on a glass of wine while enjoying their food. They have very, and I mean VERY dim lightning here. It gives it a very nice ambience though.. just don't take your grandparents like we did oops lol!! So we didn't realize that it was Tapas style here, ahh yasss another Tapas style restaurant. We ordered 10 dishes, yes 10 I know we can eat. Everything was good, my favorite would be the bang bang grouper. The shrimp taco had a very interesting flavor, and my only issue is that some of the dishes were over salted. Bring yo money when you come here because it's a little on the $$ side!! (:",

When we arrived, it was not busy at all, but it took a really long time to get anything done once it did get busy.  Just do better. Y'all tryna ruin my pride!",

I was there on business and dining alone. Had a great beverage and two dishes. One was a fried grouper dish with a spicy sauce, and the second shrimp and grits. Both were tasty but I didn't think they warranted the ~$15 price tag. Shrimp and grits was way too salty but otherwise had great rich flavors.  Super nice waiter. Good atmosphere.",

    "text": "Went to dinner this past Saturday night for a friends birthday.  We had been sitting for about 10 minutes when we were informed the bathrooms are now out of order due to a water issue and the restaurant would be closing soon (guests were being sat the entire time we were eating, still sitting people when we left).  They gave us an option to stay or leave.  We decided to stay considering it was 8-830 on a Saturday night and it would be impossible to get a reservation somewhere else.  About 15-20 minutes later we were told they were no longer serving cocktails, only beer and wine.  We were a little confused why they were not serving cocktails especially because later we saw the table beside us receiving cocktails.  We were definitely a little annoyed with how our dinner experience was going but never once complained about it or voiced our opinion about it to our server, having worked in the food industry we understood this was out of our servers hands and didn't reflect her service.  That changed when the server, Amber M, dropped our checks off, didn't say one thing when she dropped them off just placed them on the table.  After taking a look we were confused on why we were being charged a 20% service gratuity, there was only 4 of us at the table.  We asked the manager about the gratuity charge and he said she should have not done that and he will have a talk with her.  With all of the inconveniences going on with the restaurant that night never once did a manager come up to our table to apologize or even apologize about the server trying to charge us a service gratuity.  We have all worked in the food industry and we know things happen that you cannot control but this was absolutely ridiculous.  And I have never worked or been in a restaurant where the manager doesn't at least check in with tables or even walk around on the floor for that matter.  Food was okay, service was terrible.",

We had a baby with us who we bring to Disney and everywhere so the noise level didn't bother him but we could barely hear each other speak. In terms of value, the prices for what you receive aren't really that great. We eat everywhere and do not care for prices but the portions were small. We understand the tapas and small plates concept. The surf and turf sushi was the highlight of the meal. Short rib ravioli was just ok. Under seasoned and just average in terms of flavor. We also had the stuffed mushrooms. They were unnecessarily fried which it doesn't mention on the menu. A lot of people around us were enjoying the naan bread with the spreads so we probably should have tried that. The service was great. I had a great passion fruit vodka cocktail. We probably wouldn't go back with so many other better places we have tried. Worth going to once though! Maybe you'll find a favorite on the menu that is jam packed with items from across the globe.",

Ordinarily I visit La Shish Kebab or Kebab Je Rotisserie for authentic lebonese falafel. At both establishments I pay $6-$7 for a falafel that is wrapped in pita and features lots of veg. At Essex, I received 6 half-dollar sized falafel balls on a plate of tahini/hummus, with some chopped tomatoes and onions. It was tasty, but ridiculously overpriced. At most they should charge $6...or since they are charging $13, at least provide a small salad with the teeny portion of falafel. It tasted meh, compared to Le Shish or Kebab Je.   Also, the server seemed a) annoyed we were there b) cleaned our table before we left (most places wait until you leave c) she was bothered by our order which was not excessive.   The service left a lot to be desired, as well as the food. Many other places in Uptown that are fine dining, good quality & service.",

This last time I ordered a cocktail recommended by our waitress and I had the seafood tacos. They have several taco options but I ordered Ocean Prime Seafood tacos. They were very good. Remembering it's a tapas bar, you get three small tacos, I probably could've used six. But that's just me!

Great service by our waitress had drinks and food at the table in short order. It was described as a \"small plates\" sort of place but really the small plates were as large as what you would see elsewhere. Which was also reflected in the price. Not a complaint but that should have been my first clue!   That said the butter chicken and fish and chips were very nice. The butter chicken was basically in the Indian genre - very tasty curried sauce. Not sure where the \"butter\" label comes from but don't let that throw you. And it came with a massive bread loaf that was delicious in its own but perfect for sopping up the sauce.   The stuffed mushrooms were a little bland. Generous portions and Cooked well enough but still needed SOMETHING. My Bulleit Bourbon was a generous pour. Thank you! And the selection of other spirits at the bar was well chosen. Might need further exploration....  I saw other things on the menu that I expect would be very good - including a Churrasco dish, a Short Rib Ravioli AND a warm Brussels Sprouts Caesar Salad. Good spot. Definitely check this place out if you're in downtown Charlotte!",

No I weren't there with my man, but definitely a place I would come back to for date night.  This is a tapas bar, but I was in the mood for some shrimp and grits because I'm a good ole southern gal. For some reason the shrimp and grits took a while to come out, not sure why. My friends that I came with got the Ocean Prime Seafood tacos and they came out waaaay before I got my food. I did not order a cocktail because I was driving. Next time I will be sure to try one out.  This is a place I would definitely like to revisit with friends maybe for a birthday dinner or brunch. Not even sure if they do brunch but I'm sure it would be worth trying!",

We had a ninja sushi roll, bang bang grouper, chicken skewers, and veal meatballs. Everything was very good, but the grouper was especially great!   The only draw back to this restaurant was that it was a little expensive for what you got. I'd still recommend going, but it's about $15 per plate, so with drinks it's definitely a more expensive night out.",

There are thousands of people and sometimes things get a bit chaotic. This restaurant is strictly based off of reservations. If you do not have a reservation, they offer you there outside patio, with limited heating lamps. Or you can always sit at the bar which has about a good 10to12 seats. After surviving the epic center in downtown Charlotte, we were able to make our way away from all of the festivities to insure us a seat and one of the nearby restaurants. Essex bar appeared to be empty inside, that was before  we stepped in. And unfortunately  we had to sit in the outside patio, unfortunate the restaurant was not efficient  in  providing adequate heating for the Area. We complained that it was extremely cold, the waiter apologized. Luckily, I have smart and crafty friends who made an online reservation once we sat. We informed the waitress that we were only there in that area for a cocktail and an appetizer just to hold us over. Once our names were called for the reservation, we honestly thought that they were going to put us in the main area with the other bourgeoisie customers. Wrong! They threw us in another  back area where it was even colder! That is when I expressed my frustrations to the manager. I did not understand why they were not seating us in the main area. I didn't want to go as far to say that we were stereotyped as sports tourists, but clearly we did not look like the normal locals that were able to sit inside of the main dining area. But then I would be lying! My male friends had on blazers and casual dress shoes..... I had on stiletto boots. The food was amazing, but because of the confusion of seating, and how we actually felt as patrons, I have to give this place a three. My friends and I are military service members, and world travelers. We pay for good service and great food, and most of all great times. I'm a little bit disappointed this place fell below the expectation of what was given.",

Was probably my favorite of the four tapas because all of the flavors worked well together and there was a fair amount of tuna.  Bang bang grouper: 3.5/5. This was interesting. I wasn't sure what to expect, even though I was sure I had tried grouper before. I enjoyed it in this dish, especially the way it was prepared (slightly crispy).  Potato gnocchi: 3/5. This was my least favorite. The flavor was just okay and I kind of got sick of the gnocchi after a few bites.   Fried cauliflower: 4/5. This came with a nice curry sauce and had lots of Indian spices, which (for me) is always a plus.   Overall, just a good meal. Nothing extraordinary, but no regrets in choosing to dine here.

The bar is gorgeous with some of the most comfortable bar seats I've experienced to date. I imagine that the atmosphere is great on a busier night. They offer an outdoor patio which is easily accessible from the sidewalk. During my visit, they were under construction but seem to be making the best out of the situation.  I had the Gambas Al Ajillo. The shrimp seemed a bit over cooked and the broth needed a bit more salt. However, the garlic naan served on the side added much needed flavor. Underwhelming at most.   I also had the espresso cocktail. I like the idea that the cocktail menu changes often. The bartender recommended this cocktail. Underwhelmed yet again.   I plan to visit again and update my review. Hopefully, I will have a better experience.",

    "text": "Essex has been a favorite restaurant in Charlotte hands down since our first visit. We have had the coconut curry mussels, brussel sprouts caesar salad, butter chicken, and other dishes numerous times and today was the first time that the meal was underwhelming. And unfortunately we brought friends there this time after raving to them about how good it was.  The sauce on the coconut curry mussels we had tonight was very spicy; I equate it to a Red Thai curry rather than a curried dish. It was very unbalanced flavor-wise versus what I've had many times coming to Essex. Also the butter chicken was literally half the portion size as every other time that we've had it and was not creamy at all. It had a harsh curry/cumin flavor not tempered by any cream like it was in the past. Then it comes to the brussel sprout salad, which didn't come out till after we had finished our meal (in spite of our server checking on it multiple times during our meal). The flavor was off/one-dimensional and just didn't taste at all what I have come to expect from Essex standards. We also got the Kolbe beef steam buns, that were over cooked/chewy and just something about them that tasted off, or like something was missing.  The only item that was consistent with our previous visits was the bang bang grouper.   Overall, the quality of the food preparation was a sub-par 3 star experience and am wondering if this is the new state of this restaurant. If this was my first time coming, I really doubt I would ever come back. We did have great service from our waiter Hayley. She was very attentive and personable.   I very much hope tonight was just a (bad) fluke, but if the food is as underwhelming next time we come, that will probably be our last time. There are just too many great restaurants in Charlotte to waste time or money on sub-par food.",

This place also has a great drink list with a wide variety so you can find something for everyone.  The location of Essex is also great. It isn't difficult to find and it has a small outside area you can enjoy on the warm nights.

Found out once we were there it's mostly a tapas place. The three of us decided to split the brussels sprouts Caesar salad. It was humongous and even had enough left over to take home! Very delicious and unique! Considering I only eat seafood, no meat, my friend and I split the Korean barbecue shrimp tacos. Although tiny, they were absolutely wonderful! Then my two friends split pork bun rolls and short ribs with pureed parsnips. They said both were delicious.   Our only disappointment was the fact that our waiter didn't even offer a dessert menu. I'm not big on desserts and was completely stuffed, but one of my friends is a big dessert fan and always wants to check out the list. After we asked for it he brought it, but nothing jumped out at her.   Definitely would try Essex again! Another complaint is the restaurant is extremely loud!",

I wasn't aware when choosing it that the plates are served tapas style however, they are absolutely sufficient for about three people per plate. Our server, Haley, was sure to offer many wonderful suggestions and with every bite, the food was absolutely amazing. Granted we dined right after work, so the wait time was non-existent and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Dark woods, dark leathers with a splash of modern art and lights. This a a great place for after work drinks or a special celebration. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Once in a while, I'll make it into Uptown to check out a new restaurant.  I'm rarely disappointed, and Essex was no exception.  If I had one take-away from this restaurant, it's that the food tasted just as good as it was described on the menu.  I made a reservation earlier that day.  I didn't know how busy it would be on a Thursday, but when I got there, it was packed.  They have a pretty good-sized covered outdoor patio, perfect for people watching after work.  The inside was modern industrial.  I was lucky to get a booth with a window in the back to get a bit of a view without the chilly weather that night.  The waiter and staff was incredibly friendly.  They were attentive and provided some great food and drink recommendations.  I ended up with the Essex Gin and Tonic (YUM).  So we may have gone overboard with the food.  Everything is served tapas style, so it felt like the food just kept coming and coming and coming.  Waiter recommends about 4 dishes per person (we did 6). Trio dip was a big hit for an app, and I highly recommend the Churrasco (favorite of the night).  Four Cheese Flatbread was a really good size and was just as good as a leftover the next day.  Warning, this place can get a little loud, but if you're looking for a cool \"scene\", this is the place for you!  Great place for a group of co-workers or friends to go for just a fun dinner with great drinks if you don't mind the noise.",

I was not able to ask any questions about the valet. Once inside, we were greeted nicely but was placed at a table that was dirty. So we stood beside the table until someone finally noticed and swept off the table with their hand. I asked to be seated at another table to get a server that didn't understand what vegan was and could not answer any questions I had about what might be dairy and meat free. I do understand that this is not a vegan specialty restaurant but any server should be able to know that yogurt is dairy. After getting someone else to answer our questions we placed the orders but still had to send things back that were sprinkled with cheese. After the ordeal, the food was good but I believe our issues were more about servers that weren't really prepared.",

They charge $90 for a Macallen 18 without even pricing it on their menu and when you order they don't tell you the price, and you'd assume it wouldn't cost more than average, which is less than $40 in all the other places in Charlotte. So when you have 8 of those with friends, your bill is $800. This place is a fraud. Don't go there unless you want to get ripped off.",

They could've put the game sound on but oh well. Now for the food...  We had the Korean steak and eggs and the lamb burger with a Greek salad.

If it were nicer outside, I'd say try the patio instead. The corner of trade and tryon is the center of the city, and finally, someone is utilizing the prime real estate.   I ordered the Italian Old Fashioned. Not exactly what a traditional old fashioned is suppose to be, a bit too sweet with a large amount of ice.   The Short Rib Ravioli was excellent, the short rib itself was seasoned and tender, it had mouth watering flavor. The only thing I would recommend changing is the mash potatoes. They tasted light and fluffy but had a hint of something unappetizing.   We asked the waiter for a dessert menu and was disappointed to hear there was no dessert for the night. That was a bit of a surprise. A few minutes later he did return and gave us a menu from the Chef himself. What saved the night was the perfect Creme brulee.   Our waiter was uninformed with most questions, but I label that with they're in the learning phases of a new restaurant.   Overall: great location, excellent decor, and the meals are pricey but above average quality.",

We had no idea what was on the menu and  were pleasantly surprised by what we ordered - shirt steak with pureed parsnips, flat bread with steak and the most delicious calamari in tomato sauce - that was the best and most tender calamari I had since moving south.

    "text": "First, I was surprised that a 20% gratuity was automatically charged for my party of two for a buffet with no prior notice, written or spoken, as I was told was the restaurant's policy when I asked about it.  Second, the desserts were delicious!  An assortment of pastries, chocolates and cakes that looked as though they came from a French bakery.  I suspect they weren't made in-house.  Third, the vegetarian dishes and salads were very good, although none of the items were labeled so I'm not sure what was in some of them or what they were called.  Unfortunately, none of the breakfast items were good.  The French toast, scrambled eggs, link and patty sausages, hash browns and other potatoes, etc. were all surprisingly bland.  It was a huge disappointment.  The bagels were dry with no opportunity to toast them, the salmon was dry...  However, the coffee was good.  The restaurant can improve its service by letting customers know it's a buffet upon their arrival (particularly since the restaurant is located near major hotels and presumably many of their customers are from out of town).  We were seated and waited about five minutes until we caught the attention of a waiter to ask for menus and were then told it was a buffet brunch.  When we went for a second course I told twaiter we were going for seconds, assuming they would remove our first plates, but upon our return they were still on the small table.  We put the used plates on the table next to us and a waiter removed them a few minutes later.  BTW, there were only two other occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  With, on average, mediocre food and mediocre service I was very surprised about their policy of automatically adding a 20% gratuity for a party two for a buffet.  We won't be back.  I appreciate that Lauren of Essex Bar & Grill replied with considerations regarding my comments.  She didn't challenge my complaints about some of the food, which showed respect for my opinion.  Customer service is as important to me as the food, with atmosphere coming in next.  Lauren's response tells me that Essex strives to make their customers happy and that there will be improvements, so when I return to Charlotte I will visit Essex again.    I did not email Lauren because I am not looking for any kind of concession or financial inducement to return.  Her response is sufficient  inducement.  Thank you.  We will be back.",

All other stuffs we ordered including fried cauliflowers (in curry sauce), Szechuan shishito peppers and Brussels sprouts, kale and apple salad, skirt steak, etc. were all covered with way too much sauce/dressing and tasted salty and/or very sweet.

They recently received a laundry list of violations and it is not the first time that the restaurant received low scores based on some pretty absurd violations. I regret that I used to like this place as I am now unsure how safe the food was for consumption. I would sincerely recommend that all interested patrons look at the many other sanitary, delicious, and plentiful options that the city of Charlotte has to offer. I would not want to feed my family or myself anything that comes from this establishment.",

Although from start to finish, it did take an hour or so plus, so just know if you are looking for a moderately quick sit down bite, this is not the place.  I ordered the CHICKEN BRIE L'T - grilled chicken breast, candied bacon, brie spread, roasted tomato, arugula, on brioche bread.  This sandwich was great, even as leftovers the next day.  The waffle fries with it were awful.  They were thin and too crispy of a texture for them to be good fries.  Overall not a bad option, but I would think of other places before coming back.",

The best thing on the menu really is the Butter Chicken. If you're struggling to figure out what to order, that's surely what you'd want to get. If you've got transportation and time though, you could do a lot better at other places in the city. Just my two cents.",

I ordered the Lamb Lollipops, they were seasoned to perfection, the Mussels were tasty(not too much juice like I like) but still delicious. I also had a Greek salad(can't remember the name...something with an F), but I know when I return, which I will, that salad will be a definite menu selection. There's also a full bar, great view of the street and super spacious dining. I didn't try any specialty cocktails just stuck with the good old Whisky Sour",

    "text": "Honestly not sure how this place has less than 4.5 stars. I am NOT a foodie, but enjoy trying new places. Essex is one of a handful of places I've been to more than twice. I bring out of town guests, friends, date night, restaurant week -- pretty much any occasion. I imagine the star rating is because of service? Maybe. But...slow service is KEY to a tapas restaurant. You want time to enjoy each plate without the overwhelming feeling of too much food; not enough plate. It's truly worth a slow pace -- you choose this place to enjoy the food; NOT get a quick bite.   I can't speak highly enough about the food. The only change I'd make is smaller portions (which I realize is a ridiculous statement). Smaller portions would mean I wouldn't get the chance to overeat whatever comes out first - a real problem considering I've never had something I didn't want more of.   The cocktail menu and wine list are extensive. The drinks are made to order with signature touches to make them unique. Wines aren't extravagantly priced but are sourced from around the world.   THE MENU: Without a doubt I ALWAYS order the coconut curry mussels. Hands down best restaurant curry I've had. And I have a Thai aunt that makes bomb curry.   The scallops are seared perfectly and cut like butter with a warm knife. Cliche, but True.  The dip trays are a great crowd pleaser. They're not unique, but ZOMG the Essex bread (a heavenly bread loaf that's the perfect combo of naan and ciabatta with a garlic brushed butter) is worth. Every. Bite.  The fish and chips is a hidden gym -- doesn't stand out on the menu, but WOW it's good. Only better I've had is from the English chef himself, Gordon Ramsay.   Charcutiere is great; changes time to time and has a great assortment. The explanation of what cheese and where from is great.  Tuna Poke Tacos are delicious. They are exactly what you're imagining. Poke tuna wrapped up in a taco to make the experience melt in your mouth. Wonderful flavor, but not overly seasoned so as to taste the tuna.  Short-rib ravioli exceeded any expectations you could set. Who thought to combine the two? I thank them!  Lastly, the flatbreads alone are good enough to establish them as a respectable restaurant. I could imagine them opening a second restaurant selling just these. The bread is that same amazing loaf (see above!). The toppings are whatever sounds good to you. If you like what you see on the menu -- it WILL taste phenomenal.  Go here. You will not regret it. The only thing I have left here to try is the SUNDAY BRUNCH BUFFET. Honestly, can't wait.",

We ordered our drinks about 15 minutes after we sat down. After that the service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.   After about an HOUR of waiting for the rest of our meal, our food slowly began to arrive, but only two people at a time, every 30 minutes. Again, we had a party of 10. We had to ask for someone to come check on us to explain where the rest of our food was. We did not receive an apology as to why we were neglected. Another bridal party sat across from us and had the same TERRIBLE service. Several other large parties complained about the service.   By the time we left, it was 10pm. Out of our complete party of 10, 3 people actually received their full meal. We left hungry, upset and extremely disappointed. I would NOT RECOMMEND coming here, especially if it's during a busy week or if you have a large party.",

With a dead fly.  Yum!  And, shocker, there was a hullabaloo between the hostess and the waitress who showed up late and had to take her waitressing duties back from the hostess who had started to care for us.  Workplace drama, please stay away from the customers.  Especially on a casual Sunday!   Came for a work lunch.  Came EARLY for a work lunch.  Still took an hour an a half to get in and out.  Started off with the wonderful experience of having a waitress stare straight over my shoulder for three minutes while I looked her in the face as she refused to even acknowledge my presence or say something like, \"The hostess will be right with you.\"  The waiter standing right beside her kept looking back and forth between us trying to figure out what was going on, but he didn't say anything either.  Is this what passes for customer service these days?  I finally did the warm Brussels sprouts Caesar salad that Charlotte raves about.  It was nothing special.  Another in my party had it as well and concluded the same.  It was fine, just... not really worth yelping about except to dispel the myth of being at all deserving of hype.    Three strikes, Essex; you and I are through.  I won't be back for brunch, I won't be back for casual drinks or light afternoon/evening fare, and I won't be back for work lunches.  I am going to be that annoying person that makes everyone else accommodate them and change plans, just to avoid you.  Consider us broken up.",

Butter chicken with naan was very delicious in a creamy sauce with excellent naan bread. It was the best dish.  Brussel Sprout Caesar salad was good, very different but good.

Our Kale and Apple Salad came out first and was fresh and tasty. We also had the Rock Shrimp dish which was like a scampy. The warm bread was great for dipping. The Kalbi Beef was cooked nicely but our portion size seemed on the smaller side than others and wasn't hot. For my entree I had the Scallops, they we perfect and had a great flavor combination. The hubby had the steak dish but asked for it without the sauce and it was served with it. Bummer. They \"cleaned it up\" as our server said and brought it back out. I'm pretty sure they just rinsed it off and replated it.   Although nice, our server was not very knowledgeable and service was slow. We sat on the patio but they were finishing up construction next door so it wasn't the best atmosphere that evening but has potential. Maybe I'll have to give it another try.",

Their menu is expansive of dishes influenced from all corners of the globe.  Therefore, there is something for everyone.    Yummy takeaways from my experience are the following: Anything served with their house made garlic naan bread, butter chicken dish,  prime rib with pureed cauliflower, and the poke tuna tacos.  There were at least a handful more items on the menu I will be going back to try.  Price wise, you're uptown, it is not the cheapest meal you'll find but you can tell the quality is worth it.  The vibe is swanky and can be a great spot for after work drinks or a romantic date night.     They take reservations using open table.",

The atmosphere is somewhat loud but still feels alive and exciting. The food was great in areas and ok in others. If you chose to order the salmon note that they heavily seer this. This is not my preference but it is their standard. Their side dish with potatoes, carrots and creamed spinach is a winner. I also ordered the chicken curry. This is a yellow curry and it's spot on. Moderate heat and perfect taste. The other dish we ordered was the steak which was also charred. This seemed to be their technique and would recommend sharing how you like your food. Worth a visit and enjoyed it overall.",

    "text": "THE GOOD: Great location, food, and atmosphere.   THE BAD: The service could improve. I had a large party(10 ppl). We sat in front of the bar on a Saturday night. Our server seemed overwhelmed. He had to be reminded more than a few times of food orders, drinks, and extras(fork, extra wine glass, etc). It started to get a little annoying after the first couple of times. It took exactly 23 mins to get a bottle of wine I ordered. I started a timer on my phone when I placed the order because at this point the pattern of behavior(forgetfulness, slow service) was already noticed by the group. He was friendly and apologetic each time but simple requests for an extra wine glass or olives should not need reminders. I'm sure the poor service is the exception and not the rule. I'm almost certain this is the case.   MORE GOOD: The food is amazing. This is a small/medium plate atmosphere where the food is meant to be shared. We ordered different plates and passed them around so we could try a little bit of everything. Try the 4 cheese flat bread, lobster tacos, and churrasco (my favs of the night). The peppers with the calamari were a nice mix. The veal meatballs were good but cold(they sat on the table for about 10 mins because we did not receive a serving spoon and had to wait for one to be provided). I didn't like the brussel sprout salad only because I'm not a fan of the vegetable; others raved about it. The creme brulee was decent. They torch it in the kitchen, not table side. I'm not sure how I feel about that...a part of the appeal of the desert is watching it be created...(IMO).  Overall, I def.recommend and will return.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review in hopes of not receiving the blanket \"I'm sorry\" response like the others on here.   I was with a group of 15 gals last night for a Bachelorette dinner. The bride chose your location because she had never been. I, however, have been many times as a resident of uptown and was likewise excited. We had a reservation for 8:00pm and were seated right away-but it all rolled downhill after that. We ordered drinks right away, and the waitress came back multiple times telling us that they had 1 bartender on hand that night! (What?? On a Saturday night?) they finally came 30 minutes later. I started keeping track of the timeline in hopes it was just the bar. It wasn't-because we then ordered our food about the same time and the first dish (of at least 15) came out at 9:07, then the SECOND dish at 9:26. This is when I finally had had enough and went to find a manger, who was at the hostess station. Now, if I'm the manager, and we are THAT backed up at the bar and apparently in the kitchen wouldn't you be running drinks or food? After about a 5 minute heated conversation of how our service was going, he said \"Fine I will go see why it's taking so long\" I took my seat and the waitress proceeded to come back to our table-stand directly behind the bride and shout out \"I just wanted to check on everyone because someone is complaining about my service???\" Completely appalled I raised my hand to try and have her discretely come over by me so that the Bride didn't get upset. How on earth did she think this was appropriate????? As I explained to her that it wasn't her personally it was service in general our food finally started to arrive in obnoxious fashion as if the flood gates opened. At 9:45. An Hour and 15 minutes after we placed the order. We were Still missing the made of honors dinner and 1 other dish. After all was said and done, the manager came over and offered a discount on our food and a bottle of prosecco to smooth things over. While we appreciated the gestures, the overall experience was just terrible. After about another 20 minutes or so we waited for our bills, which I the waitress correct again because the bill had not been discounted it was only off 1 check. Finally, at 10:45 we paid our bills and left. 2:45 worth of dinner cut into half of our nights celebration. This place would be a complete mistake for your large group because they obviously can not accommodate properly.",

The food was still oh so on point i had the calamari, mushroom flatbread,a mule, and the Gambas Al Ajillo .If youre not of fan of spicy don't bother to order the calamari or the gambas al ajilio  they were both spicy hot and im a fan of spicy so i was fine with that and they were both so good people were eating off my plate lol.Only thing this time around my grandmother turned 98 this was her birthday dinner i feel like the wait staff could have been a little more on point. Im not sure if they were super busy or not but we had to constantly remind them to bring menus out, drinks,numerous of times they had forgotten someone had even ordered a drink a couple of the parties checks were messed up they had other people from the party on one check it was just very unorganized and frustrating to some.Oh and one other thing Kevin the manager i had been speaking to prior to this party and reservations had mentioned he would be sending out a baked alasaka for my grannys birthday nothing was ever sent out good thing we werent depent on that we were prepared and my sister from atlanta had 2 custom cake made and brought them there.I was a little disappointed kevin never came and made hiself known since i had spoken with him on many occasions over the phone. I did not see him until the end as we were walking out of the door. Again the food was great as per usual but the service/staff  was a little unorganized.",

We started with the Mediterranean trio (hummus, tomato-bisque type sauce, & baba ganoush served with flat bread) - wow, something to kick your tastebuds into high gear! We split the lamb sliders (holy-moly savory luscious lamb!!) and the brussel sprout cesar salad (of which I really refused to share - it's impressive!! I'd recommend ordering your own).

I don't mean music, just the voices and conversations of other customer. It felt like a loud late night bar. The restaurant design is nice, but no sound absorbing materials, resulting in me yelling across the table at lunch and struggling hearing others. It got better towards the end of lunch as people left, so I know it's just poor design planning. It was bad enough where I am not sure if I'd go again with others/customers, but I would go alone since the food and service is good. It's too bad that this takes away so much from otherwise a great place.",

FOOD The menu is mostly Mediterranean cuisine served as small plates and they definitely where on the smaller side for the price paid. I had the calamari and margherita flat bread. She had one of the salads and she asked for chicken to be added on top. The food was decent- she liked her salad, but my calamari and flatbread was just ok. We shared the baked Alaska dessert (see picture) which looked cool and tasted decent, but for $9 should have been twice the size it was. A traditional basked Alaska where they do a flambe at the table, but NC laws restrict that so no fire show at your seat!   ATMOSPHERE It's a cool atmosphere inside and they have a nice patio. We were there on a Thursday night and they had a decent crowd, but it was way too hot to side outside. The inside isn't huge, but you want a booth by a window. We were seated at the long banquette where they are all tables for 2 in the bar section. It was ok, but now knowing the layout, my preference would be a booth with window. It's a great place for a date or girl's night.    SERVICE Our server was Enrique and he was excellent. My friend was 15 minutes late and he was very nice and we never felt rushed.",

And I've had the flatbreads, pitas, and sandwiches there....never disappointed. However, every single time I'm there the service is below average. Servers don't come back to the table until you're nearly done with your meal. I had to chase someone down to refill my water (twice) and he acted like it was an inconvenience. Smh. The service isn't terrible so I'm still giving it three stars. I just think it's something to be aware of so you aren't surprised.",

I love coming here during happy hour for some drinks with the boys and their shrimp entrees. Their seafood and Asian dishes are very good (although I have only my own experience a limited sample size). My friends have also said their lamb chops are good. I think the people who have left negative reviews are people who have set their expectations too high or feel very entitled when it comes to the service they get. This is a great Bar & Bistro in a wonderful venue. Just trust me and get the shrimp and you will not be disappointed!",

Between the 2 of us, we ordered 4 plates to share: the Essex dip trio, veal meatballs, tuna poke tacos, and churrasco. The first item to arrive was the meatballs, which were room temperature covered with COLD sauce.  We then received the remaining 3, almost all at once. The naan with the dip trio was good; however, all of the dips seemed store bought and were mediocre at best.  The hanger steak was extremely overcooked.  The tuna poke tacos were good, but not worth a return visit.  One star because our server (unfortunately, I do not recall her name) was gracious and attentive.  I did appreciate that management did not charge us for the cold plate.  We, however, will definitely not return.",

Beef was cooked well on the sopresitas and tuna tartare outstanding.  Great menu, food was fantastic!  Only four stars because the Shwarma meat was a hair dry, but server was quick to suggest a sauce to help. Service was good, nothing over the top, but good.  Would absolutely go back.

We sat in a comfortable leather and houndstooth booth, which wrapped around us and made it feel like we had some privacy, which we liked. The butcher-block table was impressive. The music was too loud and not necessarily good. We read reviews on Yelp and decided to order Butter Chicken as it was raved about on the app. There was nothing special about it. We also ordered the Hummus, which was delicious with the addition of Harissa which added flavor. The naan breadsticks were fresh out of the oven and a highlight. The Huevos Ranchos were good with the addition of homemade corn tortillas, a signature of the restaurant. There was not a vegan option which is unusual. We wanted dessert, but Saturday at lunch is not dessert time for them and most people probably don't eat dessert then anyways, but we were still bummed a little. The service was friendly but slow even though it wasn't crowded. They left our dirty dishes on the table for an inordinate amount of time, which is one of my pet peeves. It was pricy- lunch being $55 for 2 people and the Health department rating is a 93.5- yuck. Not a place for a foodie, but good location. We paid for the location and decor, not the food. A Hot Spot can be hit or miss and this was a miss for us.",

We loved the patio!  We ordered 3 things and split them all because we couldn't decide what we wanted.  We got the Warm Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad, Short Rib Tacos, and the Butter Chicken.

Our server explained their tapas style menu and my fiance and I both ordered two plates and a dessert and were stuffed by the end of it with some really delicious food. Their menu is very unique and full of lots of interesting dishes. I absolutely loved the Tuna Poke Tacos and the plate actually filled me up quite a bit despite being one of their smaller ones. I ended up having my Mediterranean Dip Trio packed up to take home (which I completely forgot and left at the restaurant!). My fiance really enjoyed the Stuffed Mushroom plate (which was probably the smallest of the plates we ordered) and the Kalbi Beef Tacos. We both saved room for dessert and enjoyed the Baked Alaska and Beignoli which were both amazing. All in all, this was a great choice of restaurant, it was very nice with very attentive staff members, our waiter came by to check on us every 5-10 minutes and I know he had a bunch of other tables around us too, and we never had to ask for refills or anything, and the other staff that were maybe between things to do would even come by and take an empty plate, so it really felt like all of them were very attentive to every customer in the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice new restaurant to try with an excellent menu and great staff, and it's not too pricey at all. We will definitely be visiting again!",

The food was just as good as the first night we were there...that wasn't the issue.  This time, the service was so poor it is worth mentioning in hopes that we could maybe come back to the place we loved the first time we visited.  We had a party of 8 dining.  (3 of whom had never been to Essex and likely won't be back after last night).  We sat in a private area in the back which was great as we told our server we were celebrating the engagement of my daughter and her fiance and also a birthday of one of the people in our party.  The waitress was not helpful when asked questions about food and champagne selections (the favorite champagne she recommended was from the red wine section!) We knew that the food came out as it was prepared which was fine...we ordered a bunch of starters and then we each ordered a dinner as well.  Our waitress never came to see if all of our food was received and we couldn't find her to let her know that we had everything but one dish.  After watching her chat in the hall with another server for a bit, we finally called her over to ask where that last dinner was.  She said she would check on it and then said all the other dishes we ordered were prepped ahead of time and that one wasn't which is why it was taking so much longer.  I truly think it was more likely that she didn't put the order in!  The bang bang grouper should not take 20 minutes longer than the Prime Ribeye! We had brought a cake and she told she would get a candle so we could sing happy birthday to celebrate.  After waiting and waiting for her to return (and she did without it) we just ate the cake.  She brought our bill which was paid.  We sat around enjoying our cake for at least another 20 minutes after the bill was paid and never saw her again.  After we left the restaurant and were saying our goodbyes, she came running outside the restaurant and told us there was another $66 in charges that weren't on the bill and could we pay for them now.  We have no problem paying for what we ate, but the way this was done was rude and clearly she had no idea what she was doing after we paid the bill the first time.  She had plenty of time to catch her error.  Doing it after we left and chasing us down making us feel like we did something wrong was horrible!!!  We were two families getting together to celebrate our children.  We certainly weren't make to feel special in anyway by Essex or our waitress!  This was a favorite restaurant of the engaged couple and we went there to have a great night.  The food was on point but the service was the worst I have had in a very very long time!  There are lots of great food options in Charlotte.  We will definitely eat elsewhere.",

Our server Charlie was awesome, he provided detailed recommendations for both food and wine, and pretty much chose what we ate and drank. All of which was amazing.

I got there at 8:00 on the dot for my 8:00 reservation and asked if we could sit outside (there were 3 open tables).  The hostesses looked confused and said to take a seat and they would see what they could do.  15 minutes later people came in who the hostesses knew and the hostesses beamed at them and told them that they had been saving 3 tables outside so that their friends could have their pick. Ummm... ok... at this point i'm a little annoyed but assume I will be seated next and so I get over it. I then wait a few more minutes and another friend of the hostesses comes in and they are given a choice of the other two tables outside.   Finally...8:25 I am seated. Around 8:40 a server finallyyyy comes by and puts water on the table and asks what we would like to drink, etc.  another 15 min go by, we order dinner, then we are told that they dont have the wine we ordered, so we order a different wine. The food comes...still no wine...FINALLY after we are halfway through the first food item the wine comes. If you are going to have bad service, at least get the drinks to the table.  That is serving 101! We left never wanting to go back which is sad because the short rib ravioli was delicious and the pizza was good and so were the shrimp tacos.   I was talking to people about it at work today and two other groups had the same bad service we had!  They really need to fix this because there are just too many places in Charlotte that have good food and way better service for anyone to put up with this.",

A little overpriced for the quality/quantity of the food but I guess you're paying for the location as well.  The drink prices are ridiculous...seriously way overpriced.  $16 for a Hendrix gin and tonic is not appropriate.  The first one was completely flat as well but server took care of it (2nd one was average).  Maybe try this place for lunch or if you're planning on a fun night on the town with lots of money to spend.",

My Friday night experience was cool. the place was packed and very energetic. my party was a little late and the hostess asked me if I wanted a drink while I waited. I thought that was so sweet. most restaurants are hounding you for the test of your party to show up.  I ordered the shawarma tacos or pita (can't remember the name). Super good, however the sauce was too spicy for me. If you like spice though, dig in. hubby ordered the butter chicken which he raved about (and got the following Sunday we went. lol). we didn't do dessert on our first visit, but got some last night. I had the golden apple (and so did 3 other people at my table). It was TO DIE FOR!! SO YUMMY!!!  I'm 7 months pregnant so I couldn't drink but everyone at our table got a drink and said they were good! we basically shut the place down on the Sunday evening we went...although we weren't rushed out. it was such a pleasant experience and I can't wait to go back!",

Service was great, with helpful suggestions and recommendations. They were busy due to restaurant week but they did a good job of making sure that you didn't feel rushed. All of the food that I had was spectacular. I'm not normally a fan of curry or indian food, but I was very impressed. I had the coconut curry mussels, which were delicious. A bit of spice, but a great coconut and curry taste. They also provided a giant loaf (yes, loaf) of bread which was soft and warm. Great for dipping in the broth. I also got the kale salad with apples, big fan. I'm not a huge kale person, but the salad wasn't bitter, which is sometimes uncommon with kale. Perfect portion of food with lots of great flavor. I had the chimichurri steak which was perfectly cooked medium with a great chimichurri sauce with some potatoes. Last but not least, I had the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I was pretty stuffed, but the couple bites I had were creamy and well balanced with the chocolate and raspberry.  Overall, I was impressed. It's definitely a little more on the pricey side, but it would be a fun date night or night out. Everyone else I went with got something different and they were really happy with their choices!",

It's really kinda unbelievable considering their reputation, location, we had reservations, etc.  Unacceptable.  Will tell everyone I know not to go there.

There is a large patio that sits on the square - we didn't eat out there, but it looked great.  The interior has a nice mix of textures - wood, brick and fabrics that are very pleasing.    The service was impeccable - fast, friendly and helpful.  The menu at Essex is very unique with flavors from all over the world - surely something to suit everyone.  I had the warm brussel sprout chicken caesar salad.  The brussel sprouts had the perfect amount of crunch, the asiago caesar dressing was very flavorful and the chicken was perfectly moist.  My friend had the blackenened grouper tacos with a side salad.  The tacos were stuffed full of tasty grouper and the side salad was crisp and quite large.  Overall, our experience was wonderful.

    "text": "I want to like this place, I really do, but after two visits, I just can't.   First, I get that it's a \"tapas\" place, but there is zero consistency on what food comes out when. Some hot food comes out ASAP, but cold items take an obscene amount of time. I get it, things are made to order, but there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason. Additionally, both times I have gone, the couple with us have received all their ordered items (usually 2 or 3) before we have received any of our food items. Both times, I feel like our server used the \"tapas\" concept as an excuse.   Secondly, the food itself is inconsistent. The first visit, we were given three lamb sliders (this was in January). When we returned this past weekend, there were only 2, and they were much more spicy than the last time. Same with the crispy stuffed olives. First time, they were perfectly fried and there had to be 8 or more olives. This time, there were 5, and they were so fried and hard that I could have used them to break a window.   Finally, this last visit, I was overly perturbed by a situation that occurred. Our server shared with us a special that sounded delicious, and we ordered it. When it arrived, she placed it on the table and we looked at it. The looks on our faces prompted her to say, \"oh did I forget to say the meat was raw?\", to which we replied yes. I further shared that myself and the other girl at the table were both pregnant, so we can't eat anything raw, and if she would have told us, we wouldn't have ordered the $19 special. Our servers response was \"just try it, I didn't know it was raw when we sampled it but I liked it\" and then walked away. So we were then stuck with a dish that we couldn't eat because of her lack of explaination (and it wasn't that we didn't want to eat it, but raw meat falls under the no category when your pregnant). I wanted to bring this to a managers attention, but after waiting for our food for as long as we had, we had very little time before our show began. Needless to say, this was really the third strike on two sub-par meals at this place.",

    "text": "Went here with some coworkers. The Butter Chicken was amazing! The Calamari was also very good as well as the Kung Pao Shrimp. And we also enjoyed the Brussels Sprouts Caesar salad. Now for the issues... we didn't really care for the Pad Thai we ordered both a version with Chicken and another version with Shrimp. Both were fairly dry and lacked flavor. The sauce & noodles they used were both lacking. The reason I took away two stars was the service. Our waitress was \"interesting\" she wasn't friendly and was actually rude at one point. My manager and I both ordered a Coke cola. What we received was \"flat\" I told our waitress this and she said \"that's impossible.\" My boss agreed that his was terrible as well... she said well it's Pepsi not Coke... after going back & forth with her she said it came from a 2-Liter bottle... no wonder it tasted bad. She said their soda taps weren't working. They could at least use cans or individual glass bottles if their machine is down. She was a weirdo, very aloof & didn't even acknowledge us when we requested something. I wish I knew her name. And she got 20% that was included in the bill cause it was 6 of us. We would have probably left 15% on our own and she didn't even deserve that. Cool place with good food but they need to hire or train their servers better.",

Paid the same price as everyone else did but did not get to eat several dishes as once they were gone, they did not refill  - if that is the case, they should have stopped taking reservations at a certain point. (I Missed out on salad and frenchtoast among others..)   The serving utensils for the buffet were so gross/unkempt- sticky with various food all up and down the stem of the utensils . They did not keep the area clean even though I saw plenty of staff there.   Food was so-so but the service and above complaints overrode any pleasurable experience.   I'm guessing most people might simply like the ambiance for the nightlife?? Again, I went during brunch hours. Very disappointed  I don't like paying for a bad experience.",

I would also say this place could Be an option for after work drinks with coworkers!! Can't wait to give that a try!  But for now I only went for lunch.  Arrived at 12:00, place was not too terribly busy and was able to score a table on the cool patio.  Ordered the fish tacos that came with a side Greek salad or sweet potato fries and chose the Greek salad.  Both were excellent and the right amount of food! Service was friendly and inviting, decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was just perfect.  Got the bill and spent a whopping $11.39.  I couldn't believe it.  For the quality and the nice portion size it's a steal!! I can't remember the last time I received  good quality food for less than $20.    Looking forward to the dinner experience whenever I make the trek into uptown at night.  ONEEEEE tiny design dislike.  Whoever thought that placing black toilets in the woman's bathroom was chic or a good idea...it was not.  Black toilets are never ok IMHO. *shudders* But good job on the round teal mirrors! *thumbs up*",

I enjoyed the beet salad, and the freshness of the shrimp used in the gambas ajillo, and the quality of all ingredients was exceptionally high.  Portion sizes were actually massively generous, befitting the price but unexpected coming from Chicago and San Francisco where \"shared\" sometimes feels like a sophisticated-but-cruel joke. I would have preferred more flavor a less quantity though. Still, quality is super high so there's promise here - I think they could pare down the menu to a few truly exceptional options and have a winner.   I may have not ordered the best things on the menu and am happy to give the Essex another try.",

I Made a 7:30 reservation at Essex for a birthday party for 16 people after the restaurant at merchant and trade accidentally double booked and cancelled our reservation.  I was grateful that they allowed me to make a reservation at Essex last minute as merchant and trade told us two days before the party.  When we arrived we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. We started dinner pretty frustrated due to the long wait. They do not valet parking so those who paid a cab to bring them here or paid to park nearby would be out of the cost if we relocate. Not to mention the venue is Uptown so the odds of us finding another place to accommodate us last minute nearby is slim.   They definitely redeemed themselves later. The food was good and they staff was very attentive once we were seated. The manager brought the table a dish for our trouble.  I recommend coming but prepared if you have a large party reservation, there may be a wait on a busy night.",

Complaints from those visits include lousy seating (chair height wrong for tables, weak service, inept hostesses).  Food isn't fantastic but pretty good.   Last evening, 5pm, I arrived with an out of town friend traveling on biz.  Just bad all around; service non-existent (had to get our drinks at the bar), bland bordering on rude staff, plenty of 'workers' standing around hostess stand socializing, incomplete menu given us.   Conclusion: You, Essex, must only be reliant on out of towners/one time only visitors because no one who cares about good service will revisit you.  Me?  I made the mistake three times to let my guests choose the spot.  Not anymore!!  No Essex!",

I know mistakes happen but this was blatant. I had reservations on Saturday evening for 7 people. When we arrived we were seated and the restaurant wasn't busy. It took over 15 minutes to be greeted and when we went to let the hosts know they replied \"well we only sat you 5 minutes ago but okay.\" What!?! Who says that to a paying guest. While others around us who were sat after us, were being greeted. When our server finally did arrive he said \"sorry I was waiting on change for another table.\" Everyone sitting at this table has worked in the service industry, and we are understanding if we can see that someone is very busy and doing their best. But we saw this guy just walking around talking to coworkers. That's the least of it though because the entire time we were ordering the server would make snide remarks under his breath. He at one time under his breath said \"damn I'm just trying to help this b**** out\"   I didn't have time to ask to speak to someone because we were on a time restraint heading to a concert.   Food was good but experience sucked.  Obviously will not be back.",

We then went to him to ask that he make it to go since the game was ending and we didn't want to wait. Another 10 minutes until the food came. We wound up paying early to save time. $41.

There were no special ingredients in it... and I'm pretty sure it's not bottled up, so not sure how they could just run out of a hand made cocktail entirely.  She ultimately came back and said, oh they have it today, but I found it to be a weird situation.  My friend ordered the Korean steamed bun... and the server said, \"oh that's no longer a steamed bun, it's going to be made in a slider roll, hope that's okay.\" Umm, that's not really okay.  The churrasca was okay... but the Alfredo sauce on the chewy, burnt potatoes didn't seem to pair well with the chimichurri sauce. The beef was also over cooked.  They brought out shrimp and grits, even though we ordered Korean bbq shrimp tacos. We sent that back.  At the end of the night, she ran my card on a different table's check.

I ordered a lemon martini and I did not know what to expect because although I DO love lemons and I Do love martinis, there was only ever one other place that was amazing. Now Essex Bar takes the lead on my choice of martinis with   Yum!   Next, I ordered a cranberry and vodka  and Sprite and asked for a touch of grenadine for pink's sake!! For foo foo appeal I suppose.  They did not disappoint! I forget the mixologist's name but I will be going back as soon as I get back!",

    "text": "I've been to Essex several times by now, and here's my take on this hot spot.  I'll start by saying I've always liked their spacious layout with cool, contemporary ambience.  They offer a variety of tables, from booths and stand-alones, to several long tables...so it's good for dates, as well as bigger group outings.  However, prepare to repeat yourself if you're dining with a group on a weekend night...as it tends to get very busy...and very loud.  Also, given that it's an uptown restaurant, parking is a bit pesky...and you should prepare to walk at least one block, on the most part.  In the past, they validated your parking ticket if you chose Autopark 2 blocks away, but no longer.  All that aside, I've always been impressed with their eclectic menu of fusion-style foods.  Since most plates are tapas-style, with smaller portions, I'd recommend ordering 2 plates per person.  On my latest occasion, I tried their Short Rib Ravioli and Fried Cauliflower.  Both were unusual chef-inspired creations and beautifully presented, so extra points right there...and as expected, delicious!  By now, I've tried a good variety of plates...and so far, I haven't been disappointed.  I especially enjoyed their Shrimp & Grits, Kalbi Beef Steam Buns and BBQ Shrimp Tacos, but most items on the menu are unique, and worth trying.  If you enjoy taking pictures of your foods, you won't be disappointed either.  Just know that your bill will most definitely rack up, given that you may be ordering more than 1 plate per person, with approximately $14-$19 per plate.  Despite a few possible pesky factors (mostly the noise level on weekend nights), I've always found the dining experience here to be highly rewarding...and I will most likely return again!",

It was reasonably priced compared to other mothers day brunches in Charlotte. The French toast was my favorite and my brother really liked it as well. My brother and I also really really liked the butter chicken it reminded me of the Indian chicken masala. My mom fell in love with the cheese selections they provided as well as the Macrons.  The buffet was full of food the grits were amazing I mean we really couldn't complain it was a great Sunday and the day was beautiful.",

We were a party of 5 so that always presents a challenge... not for these guys and gals.  We were promptly seated and our last minute request for a booth was granted.  Let's get to the food...  The stuffed mushrooms... YAAAZZZ. I was knocked off my feet with the flavor explosion from these guys.  We then has the cauliflower and boy oh boy were we pleased either the curry explosion of flavor.    We also had the ravioli short rib and it was extremely satisfying.  I cannot complain about the quality of food.  But it is always awkward when you don't want to share food and the waiter makes it very obvious that you should share.  Not everyone wants to share.  Sometimes you want all the yummy food all for yourself.    The decoration was modern with interesting accents of chains hanging from the ceiling and photography in frames hanging over tables with tattooed men and women's feet.  I'm not sure exactly what they were doing there, especially with Edison bulbs everywhere, but hey... to each their own.    I will definitely be back and look forward to not sharing anymore food again.",

The service was superb and the food was even better! This is definitely a place you come to share your food with everyone so you can try it all. Everything is amazing. I had a great glass of Chardonnay and the the \"Harvest Moon\" I believe it was called( a bourbon cider drink)... yum! We ate things like carpaccio, tuna tacos, dip trio, skirt steak, mussels... all to die for. Anything with short rib in it was amazing! Per usual we scarfed the food down so fast I couldn't get a picture.   The only down side was the mojito. We had just had one from BLT down the street and this one couldn't compare.   I will continue recommending this place though! Can't wait to go back!",

The inside was pretty dark. I would say the inside ambiance is good for drinks after work or date night. Outside was good for me and my peoples. We were doing some heavy people watching.   I feel like this should be a tapas place because the portions were lacking. I thought my homies dish was tacos but it was small shrimps in olive oil sauce with some naan. I had really small Lobster tacos which were good, but thank God for the bread, or I would have had to stop at a Burger joint.   The brussel sprouts were pretty tasty. I'd definitely recommend that if you decide to venture here.   Also our server was on point. He was patient and all up in our convo (in a good way). I appreciate a little banter with my food.   Will I go back? Nah.   This is just one of the spots I can, \"Yea, been there done that.\"",

Two of us decided to split three different items: Caesar brussel sprouts (I really liked this), lobster tacos (decent), and gambas al ajillo (the flavor, while a little too lemony, was good but the shrimp were tiny, popcorn shrimp sized).   I do feel like it was too expensive so for that and the mostly just okay food, I give this place three stars. Not terrible. Not stellar.",

I got the sweet potato for my side but it was cold when I got it. Since the service was slow, I opted to not get new sweet potato because it would have taken long to get it. My friend had the Butter chicken flatbread but she didn't really like it because it had curry in it which was not in the description on the menu.

The manager is a waste of space and doesn't seem to care about feedback. Basically just said \"it is what it is and he doesn't make the decisions\"! If you want to have a great drink and wonderful food, there is every other place in charlotte and this probably ranks at the bottom of my list now. Nobody from my entire team will ever be going back to this place. My advise to you is if you do decide to waste an evening of your life dining here, make sure you ask the price of any drink you order that is not listed on the menu. They have a tendency to make up prices that are outrageous!",

So after a couple times I informed our waitor about it and his response was \"sounds like their problem\". On top of that, he didn't refill my water towards the later end of our meal. Overall, I would rather spend my money somewhere else because you are just paying for the atmosphere and location.",

Incredibly horrible service the last time I was here (i would give this one star, had I not had 2 other decent experiences here.)  $19 for a Manhattan? Served incorrectly and not comped - too high. Then the server said the drink tasted off because the dishwasher was broken, so we were probably drinking dish soap residue. It was served \"straight up\" but over ice, then brought back to me 30 seconds later after it was strained into a half full coupe. Ten minutes after having ordered the drink (after taking my order) the waiter introduced himself (again) and asked if he could bring me anything only to realize we had been there/his table the whole time.   Expect a wait on cocktails, usually about 10 minutes even for a cocktail on tap. Great location for Charlotte, but I will not be returning.",

I'm not normally a fan of tapas restaurants- usually that just means the restaurant is going to give you tiny portions at 80% of the cost of a full meal, and you end up ordering 3!  Not here, the portions are BIG.  Yes, smaller than a full meal but still bigger than average tapas.   I went for restaurant week- it was a salad, 2 plates and a dessert and that was waaaaay too much food. If I went on an average day, I'd split 3 plates with my husband and that would be plenty.   I got the grouper- it was in a sweet and spicy sauce- so tasty.  I also got the tuna tacos, also delicious!  I would definitely go back since there was a lot on the menu I wanted to try.    The only negatives I have: The waiter was not friendly- but that's pretty much how restaurant week always is.  And second, it's really loud- but that's also how all new restaurants are now.

By far the best I've had in Charlotte!  The mussels were good quality and the curry sauce had the perfect amount of heat.  They came with a little loaf of bread for dipping and we probably could have gone through another 2 or 3 loafs with the sauce easily.  On another note - I found the drink menu very disappointing for a place advertised as a cocktail bar.  My boyfriend and I both ordered tequila beverages - His was very sweet and my margarita tasted like straight sours.  All in all - I look forward to trying some other food options, but I would suggest sticking to beer or wine.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Essex last weekend.  The service was wonderful and so was the ambience.  Essex has balanced an upbeat vibe with its music and art and an intimate vibe with lighting and beautiful accents.  The wine selection was great with a wide price point and our dinner was lovely.  While our waitress suggested two small plates each we were actually overwhelmed by the amount of food for the table when we did so.  The portion sizes were wonderful and we had plenty of food to take with us to enjoy again later.  The ravioli was incredible. Whatever you do... Order that.  The only thing I could even remotely complain about was the gnocci because it was really salty and a few of our party didn't enjoy it. Which could have just been a fluke.  Clearly Essex takes its food and dining experience very seriously and we can't wait to go back!",
