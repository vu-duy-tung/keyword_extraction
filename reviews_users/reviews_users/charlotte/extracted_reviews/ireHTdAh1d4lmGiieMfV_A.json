Pool is very reasonably cheap they have bout 7 full size table and i think 3 - 4 smaller ones, but the also got Darts,  Foosball, Corn holes and even a Punching Bag Machine (which im not a big fan personally)  they have differen't pool rate per hour according the day of the week that ur playing, ranging from $5-10 an hour,   They do have drink specials or even a meal special which is good, people always wants a deal lol.   i have to say the place has undergo some big changes in the last 5- 6 years, things on the menu,  staff, the atmosphere, i have to say now its much better than before, except the food cause they dont have my God Father Melt no more ='(   PS their chicken fingers were really tender and juicy tho....

UFC Fights are shown with a $5 cover. If you are a fan of Fox and Hound and their food, you will live this place as they are from the same group.  We experienced very good service on my most recent trip. Does this place have something that will make me want to become a regular? No, but it's a nice spot to watch a special sports event or share a few drinks as there isn't a plethora of bar options in the Ballantyne area. I'm giving it 3 stars because I wasn't wowed or found myself clamoring to come back.",

    "text": "Inconsistency is the only consistent thing about Bailey's.  I'm giving it 4 Stars because we have had far more good experiences than bad ones but you don't know quite what you're going to get when you go.  Food is generally good but it can be slow.  If you're hungry be sure to order some starters as soon as you arrive. They still might take 20+ minutes.  Wings, nachos, and other bar food is usually pretty consistent though there are exceptions.  Usually their chicken tenders are outstanding--among the best I have ever had.  However, sometimes they serve a substitute which are among the worst I have ever had.  Service is also hit and miss.  Even with a good waitress we find that they are \"gone\" far more than they are circulating.  They tend to congregate at the bar, particularly when things are slow.  Some are good at their job and seem to be competent and happy that they are in food service.  Others act like they despise being in food service and seem like they'd rather be doing ANYTHING other than waiting on the general public.  The place does need a really good clean-up and re-fresh.  The men's restroom is worse than any bowling alley or bus station I've ever been to.  It's the worst of any restaurant I've ever been to and has been for years.  It needs major repairs and cleaning.  Ideally it should be completely overhauled with completely new facilities, improved ventilation and some sort of deodorizer.  It seems to be undersized for the place and between that and apparent vandalism, it's always in poor shape.    I like the good experiences I have had at Baileys.  If they could fix and maintain the restroom and improve wait staff service they'd have a consistent 4 Star place on their hands.",

One of my friends suggested Bailey's. I've never been, but was pretty excited to play pool again. I haven't played in years!  Bailey's was PACKED! I didn't expect such a big crowd, but it was pretty saturated with what looked like college students. It kinda made me feel old and out of place lol Nonetheless the environment was very relaxed with open mic for karaoke and corn hole outside. The location is very spacious so despite the crowd, the wait for a pool table was not long at all. The food was pretty decent. We ordered wings, chicken tenders and fries (typical bar food) while we played. Prices for drinks/beer were reasonable. They have daily specials so check them out!  Overall, a great hangout place.. especially when everything else closes at 9.",

I was trying to shoot pool the last time we went and they had the back part of the place doing some kind of painting class.  It was very distracting.  I wanted to play pool, drink beer and listen to music.  Instead, I had to hear instructions on painting mixed in with the bar's ambient music and then the music the painting class brought along. We ended the night early that time.  As far as food, we liked it better a few months ago when it was owned by a different company I believe?  Food seems to have changed a bit but is still good.  Wings are not as good - they started lightly dusting the wings with flour I think.  Chicken wings should have no flour!!!  They have great chicken fingers, pretzle dippers, burgers..   I love to shoot pool and they always have the beer I like. Food is decent. It's also just a real casual place. I think those things make it deserving of 4 stars.",

My side salad had a half frozen tomato and the Italian dressing looked like a giant snot ball(yummy) the tenders were ok and the buffalo sauce tasted great but very spicy. My girlfriend said the burger was just ok and the Parmesan fries not very good. When getting the check of course it was wrong, they tried to charge me for the drunken tender entree.

It wasn't overly crowded, but it wasn't dead either. At exactly 10pm the lights above our table turned off. That was different. Dealt with it .... and then the DJ appeared.  This dude was BLASTING what I would describe as club music.  The bass vibrated my unmentionable areas.  I had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard.  Bro, it's PINEVILLE not uptown Charlotte.  If I wanted to have music vibrate my insides I'd haul myself to an actual club. What made it especially awkward - NO ONE was breaking it down. A few head bobs, the occasional arm wave,  but no one seemed to enjoy it.  One woman actually plugged her ears and looked like she wanted to die.  Seriously,  lose the thumping music and remember what you are, a low key bar/restaurant with pool tables.  Don't try to pretend you're something else.

It took at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged, and once our waitress took our drink orders, it took her quite some time to come back. I had to get up from the table and ask her to take our orders, because at this point it was already at least 30-40 minutes into our 1 hour lunch break. We never got water refills. We had to ask for straws. One burger came without mayo. It was never mentioned that sides were an extra charge, and she put all 7 of our orders on one check. So as we're already late to get to back to work, she comes back and asks us all again what we ordered. Our waitress might have been in over her head, but for only having 6 full tables and maybe 5 visible staff, they should know how to turn tables during the lunch hour within 30 minutes. Again, the food was enjoyable, but I definitely won't return again to this location for lunch because it will take 1.5 hours. Very disappointing service.",

    "text": "Ahh Bailey's. What was once a solid neighborhood bar for my friends and I to have a few beers, shoot some pool, and socialize has turned into something far different. The drinks haven't changed much, the pool tables are still plentiful, and the servers are still friendly (for the most part). So, you're probably wondering why the sudden change of heart about this place. Well, Bailey's recently underwent a change of management due to the former one getting transferred. Things sure went downhill after that! They are simply trying WAY too hard to lure in customers now. DJs, bands, unnecessary events, most of which nobody cares about are a regular occurrence here. This wouldn't be too big of an issue, but you have to pay a cover for these! And that is just annoying. Bailey's, you just need to keep it simple! Stick with alcohol and pool, ditch the new frills, and I'll be back then.",

I was invited out for some pool and drinks, and I was already curious about the place so here is my review.  For those who love to shoot pool and have some drinks, this is a great bar.  They have 7 full size tables (maybe more), along with a punching bag game, ping pong, darts.  The pool cues were straight (made of fiberglass I think, but felt ok).  There were TVs everywhere, so I am sure its great for games also, and the night I went they had singers getting judged.  Some better than others.  The food was typical fare for any bar, and the beer selection was also typical.  Service was great, with our server walking by just enough to make sure we didn't need anything.",

I quickly changed my order to buffalo wings. the sauce was mediocre and one wing (boneless) was actually just breading.  my debit card had been deactivated due to fraudulent activity and I was unaware. the waitress came back and handed my friend their check to sign and then turned to me and said 'and yours has been declined, so like, what do you plan on doing?' luckily I have multiple methods of payment but this server just lacked tact or sensitivity.",

But the good news is that they do have a pretty decent selection of  sauces to chose from!   There's plenty of tv's if you're there for a sporting event and pool tables and dart boards in the back.

Next the people that I was with ordered fish and chips, 15 minutes later they come back saying they do not have any fish and chips. So me and a friend ordered a burger. When it finally came the fries were old and cold. So I sent the fries back and my friend sent back the whole meal because it was cold. 15 minutes later they bring me some hot fries and bring my friend the same fries from earlier. He asked for the manager and when he came the manger just the food doesn't get any hotter than what it was. I will never come back here and I suggest that no one does.",

Then, after she took it back and the manager brought out the re-cook, I had almost finished my food before she came over to ask how it was and to offer me another Guiness. I had an empty glass for at least 15 min... She hasn't even told us her name but, she has maybe 3 tables. I watched her walk to-and-from one of her other tables 4 times before she came to check on us after I got the re-cook. Not too sure about coming back here again.  After writing this review, the server completely changed within less than 5 min and both managers were on the floor. Complete 180 of how it was before. Still not sure about this place if it takes posting a review before getting proper service.",

It reminds me of the \"TOILET\" in Trainspotting.  There are two urinals that are six inches apart.  Two people cannot use them at the same time because they're too close together, and there is no divider.

As far as music and drinks it's very mediocre, the service from the \"servers\" is extremely horrible. God for bid they'd actually have to pay attention to their customers.  I rarely do  reviews for bars but i feel like I'd have to get it out some way because it was obvious that my server being rude and inattentive was not going to get noticed by the manager. After getting a pool table and waiting a good 30 mins to get food and drink order our server finally came. Placed our drink and food order and completely rushed it out of us as if she had a time limit to get the order in \"10 pm on Friday\". When we finally got our food we realized she forgot our nachos after finishing all of our food. We told her she forgot our nachos thinking maybe it was already made and she can just run it to us but she just went and put the order in. And before that i asked for  simple glass of water she looked at me dead in the eye and said \"sure I'll grab that\", but then continued to go sit at her own table with co workers to eat and dance to the god awful music they had playing. I really wanted to like this place because of the amount of pool tables they have but the servers could use a whole lot of common sense and training.",

My buddies and I typically stop by on Tuesday nights since the draft beers only cost a crisp two dollar bill. The food is pretty good. One friend had a bit of an issue with the bacon on his burger not being cooked well enough, that was disappointing... The shredded chicken tacos I had recently were pretty tasty.  Not a fan of the bathroom, sort of a mess. The outside facade was done well by the complex, but the inside still seems like the same ol dingy Bailey's.",

Teki is fantastic and always goes out of her way to make sure my husband and I have an excellent time! The food is not your typical bar food but acceptable for any foodie palate because the food is made up to par. I just can't explain how much I love this place! Great food, staff, and bar games! Highly recommend this location!",

    "text": "Went to Fox & Hound on Friday night for Paint Nite, a canvas-painting class that travels to different locations around Charlotte. There was plenty of parking, so I had no trouble getting parked and inside. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a staff member who directed me to the area where Paint Nite was set up. This was great!  The restaurant itself is huge, but the bar area is pretty small. Once I got situated for Paint Nite, I went to the bar to order a drink and it was a solid 7 minutes before anyone was able to help up. The designated Paint Nite server approached us and took our drink order so we could take our seats and start painting. I appreciated that. But it was about 20 minutes until we got our drinks, and they actually lost my drink order so I had to reorder and wait another 10 minutes for my beverage.   When I did get my strawberry watermelon margarita (that was only $6, BTW), it was delicious and refreshing and not too sweet (thumbs up). They were much more efficient with bringing our checks and closing our tabs. I did not try any of the food, but it looked and smelled really good.",

An hour goes by and the restaurant fills. Still no food. Table that ce after us got served 1st. Half our meals, table of 6, got bad tasting food or just blah.

I've been here 3 times in the past 6 months and all three times I have had to go find a waitress to take my order. That's a direct reflection on the management (or lack thereof). I paid a $5 cover each for my wife and I on May 5 to be served above average food with almost non-existent service. I liked this place when it was Bailey's. And other Fox and Hound's have been pretty good. Definitely need a change in management at this location and the wait staff needs to be completely retrained on what good customer service is.",

Not impressed at all. Food came out in decent time and we ate. A little later the waitress wanted to leave which was okay (I've waitressed before so I totally understand), but she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her. In reality, we were waiting for our checks for over 30 minutes. After her saying she wanted to leave, we continued to wait 30 min for her to come back with our actual checks so she wasn't in a big hurry. Most of the time she was absent and unable to flag down.",

A customer on her way out actually stopped and said \"I m pretty sure they would tell u to just sit any where\" . So we wandered around dodging the construction and found a table. A male server finally came up to us and said someone will b right with you.  About 10 mins later a female came over to take our drink orders.  She was friendly. I took the opportunity to go ahead and or an appetizer. Thank goodness!  It took longer than I would have expected to get our drinks considering the place wasn't busy.    Our appetizer and waitress took forever to reappear. I almost went looking for her. She did finally come back and dropped off our ap and then ran away without taking our order.  My husband was not happy but I told him maybe we should take this as a sign and just get the check and leave.  She finally came back once we were done with the ap and at that point I just asked for the check. Again it took longer than it should have for the place to be empty. We almost left cash and walked out.  Not sure what was going on so after we paid and left we found another restaurant to actually have lunch at..We had much better service.",

In that time period the whole staff was ooing and awing over a small puppy in the office. Um aren't pets not allowed in restaurants/bars? I know service animals are but a small puppy that can't even be put down to walk on their own is a service dog?   The food took awhile and according to my boyfriend it was sitting in the window for a very long time.  The last straw was waiting to leave. It took the longest time to get our waitress attention to get the check and then once we did have he check I noticed her at a pool table checking out a male guests tattoos on his back. He had his shirt off and she was touching his back tattoo. I guess he was more important then her guests?   Absolutely horrible. If you like Fox and Hound go to the one in Ballentyne instead.",

At this point we were happy with the resolution and decided to stay. Then we made the mistake of ordering the chocolate chip cookie. After waiting for 15+ minutes for it to come out, we were informed that the kitchen had burned the first one. Okay, I guess that happens. But then when the second one came out it was RAW.

Im giving it 4 stars because of the purpose it served for a UFC fight. TVs everywhere. Stools everywhere. I dont know any where that televised the fight where you could walk in at 10pm and get a seat. But this place is so large that is exactly what we were able to do.    The hostesses or i should call them the girls at the entrance standing around chatting need to go. Im not sure what thwir intended purpose was but they disnt greet us and when I asked if there was a spoke for to she told me we could look around. So the result was me being annoyed from the get go. Mind you as i mentioned before there was plenty of open seats in the next room. I wonder how many people just walk out beause of them. And it seems like several people have posted on here about it and nothing is being done.   Now that my rants over once we were able to find seats our actual waitress was very attentive and worked the entire large room extremely well.  We werent hungry being there so late but flipped through the menu which seemed pricey for pub food but the beers were priced where I would expect them.   We will def be back for a fight night.",

    "text": "Stopped by Saturday night with 2 friends to watch the UFC fights. We got there around 9:15. When we walked in, we were told by the hostess that we could sit wherever. A plus is that this place has a bunch of TVs. It did take a little while before we were acknowledged by a server. First, we had ordered waters and asked if they had any drink specials, which were $3.50 select tall boys, some fireball shot special, and one other shot special that I can't remember. Two of us wound up ordering 20oz draft beers (one sour and one IPA) and my other friend ordered some sort of cider in a bottle.   We agreed to get an order of hot honey boneless wings as an appetizer and our own entrees. Typically, I'm more of a traditional wings type of girl, but these were pretty good. Our server said that a small size is about 8 pieces, but some of our pieces looked like they had ran out of wings and cut up chicken tenders instead.  Our entrees came at the same exact time as the appetizer, which is pretty annoying considering my entree was cold by the time I got to eating it. I had ordered a Cheeseburger with pickle fries, my friend ordered The Dilemma with pickle fries, and my other friend ordered the Voodoo Burger with pickles fries. My friends said their sandwiches/burgers were good but nothing to rave about. I wound up not getting a cheeseburger and got a hamburger because they forgot to put the cheese on it.   After we were done eating, my friend and I decided to grab another beer (same as we had ordered earlier). When the waitress handed me my beer, I noticed the color was a little off and it was pretty foamy at the top. After taking a few sips, I then realized I was given the incorrect beer. Our server was not very apologetic, but took it back and got me the correct beer.    Overall, this experience was mediocre and I don't really see myself ever coming back.",

The service was decent and it was a great atmosphere to go hang out and watch a game or shoot some pool.  The food was....pretty basic bar food. Although the burgers were all very noticing visually, and the ingredients they had SHOULD have been great, both my burger and one of my friends were basically flavorless. They tasted like burger meat with no flavoring whatsoever. It wasn't a bad burger, but it was pretty bland aside from the fresh jalapenos on it. The nachos and other appetizers we ordered were pretty good, although the boneless wings were similar to stuff you find in the frozen foods, again not bad - but not great.  Anywho I would still come back here to try something else, grab a beer (selection was good) and watch a game.",

    "text": "Subpar food, drinks and service..... at its best. There's literally no real reason to go back. We wanted somewhere close to watch the fight at. Upon arrival it smelled like old bleach water lol. There were several available tables but some reserved ones as well. We were able to snag a table just in time before an influx of people came in. I had no idea the fight would bring such a large crowd to this side of town . I'm thinking everybody had the same thought process as us to go somewhere a little more low key and avoid the hassle of uptown . Thanks to Yelp we had a coupon for free wings. Nothing super special but good enough. The fries were eh. I did enjoy my quesadilla. He ordered a burger that was just ok.... it was nothing to order again. Our waitress really moved slowed... like literally , she just looked in slow motion all night lol even prior to the crowd. She took a drink that wasn't even finished and tried to reason with us that it was gone.... eventually she went and refilled his drink.  I really think they should do some renovations. This place looks dingy. lol. I wasn't a fan and I doubt I'll be back to that location.",

I reserved a table and they looked at me like I can't help ya, Sorry. I was like Damn.   There's no hostess and u pretty much gotta find yo own table. And flag down a waitress if u need something. With that being said I'm still giving this place a 3 because they don't cover charge for PPV events unless it's somebody like Mayweather or something. And the food is decent. The chicken quesadillas were pretty filling. So I can't just slam the place. Good place to go to if u wanna check out a good fight and have a few drinks.",

    "text": "Been to many Fox & Hounds.   This one is very disappointing.  New to the area thought I'd give it a try.   Outside looks very appealing. I get inside my initial thought was do they allow smoking inside.  After standing at the entry for awhile debating to leave the bartender yells to me sit wherever.  Normally I sit at the bar but this bar was very small and already full.   Plus at the bar the rest of the restaurant is behind you.   I sat down at a table, they had one server, one bar tender and one girl just walking around.   Ordered a draft beer and the buffalo chicken sandwich.   Beer tasted like the lines need cleaned.   And the buffalo chicken that was described as marinated in buffalo sauce was just a chicken breast that was barely dressed with buffalo sauce.   I will not be returning and the only reason I'd say anyone would return is they had nice looking billiards.",

I ordered a patron margarita from the bar and it tasted like straight sour mix.  I returned it. My fiance ordered fish and chips. The fries were suppose to have garlic parm.  We had to send them back and they just sprinkled parm on one side of the chips.  Just not a good place to for food.  Maybe pool only.",

    "text": "It sadden's me to bump my 5 star review down today, we are frequent customers of Fox and Hound as my bf loves to come here for Thursday poker nights. The food is good and the drinks are priced ok for a place like this. What really brings my update down is the service.. or lack there of. We've been coming here for months now I'd say and its always the same story (excluding the first experience I wrote about). I sit down to do some work and have a beer while the bf goes for the poker tables. It takes MORE THAN 30 MINUTES for someone to even acknowledge my existence! Simultaneously, there are about 3-4 servers weaving around my table to help their other customers. Is it a crime to come in as a single customer?... I'm ordering drinks and food here for myself and my bf people. Cmon...    Today, I finally got sick of this recurring treatment and called the manager out. She understood and was apologetic about it, which was nice. She sent out a server right away who kind of joked it off like.. I'm not sure what happened here. But, there server put my order in right away and everything came out in a prompt manner following the confrontation. They put forward awesome service afterwards but, its not cool if it comes after all this trouble.   I hope this is a wake up call for Fox and Hound. Maybe have a meeting to enforce seating arrangements between servers or something.. The ball can't be dropped this many times. We will be returning for Poker nights but, I hope the service improves after this. I hate to be the Negative Nancy here, I really do.",

I stopped by to grab some wings and catch the end of the playoff game and was half greeted by a hostess(if that's what she was) while she was on the phone and she silently mouthed that she needed my id. Then she said have fun so I just went off to seat myself. A waitress came over and took my wing order. I asked if they could do all drums and would even be fine paying an upcharge but she said they couldn't do that. They only had 2 wing size options: small and shareable. I got the shareable and received 12 smaller sized wings so just a heads up that you won't be sharing these with many people. Really surprised 12 wings costed me almost $17 so I was a bit disappointed. The Caribbean Jerk wings were good. The parm garlic wings had no flavor so I just requested some additional Jerk sauce and made them jerk wings as well. If I visit again, it'll probably be just for beer and watching games.",
