    "text": "A gem of a dive bar for True football fans. Steamers has taken a step above most bars and has dedicated rooms and areas for game fans. The main teams that Steamers has dedicated areas for are the Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, and the Cleveland Browns. On game day you can not find a better atmosphere other than being at the actual game. They have great drink specials, particularly on buckets of beer. Their quesadillas, fried green beans, and open face roast beef sandwiches are just a few of my favorite menu items, on a side note it always tastes the same great consistency. However, even if you don't like football or if it is the offseason they have plenty of pool tables, darts, corn-hole, karaoke, and trivia to keep you busy.",

Bartender asked how many he had and he accurately responded with \"two\" so she served him one... the second time around she refused to serve him stating he was over served... bad taste in my mouth and we will surely not be going back... we literally traveled 40 minutes to come back to one of our \"favorite bars\" and we surely won't be returning... the uber money isn't worth it for this trash!!!!!!!! I will say I noticed it was new staff and it was terrible... surely losing them lots of money! RIP steamers... it was sure great knowing ya",

    "text": "Last night was my first and last time going there. The food was subpar to say the very least. We came only intending to watch Game 7 of the World Series. We ordered an appetizer, loaded nachos or something, and it was literally a handful of nachos with microwaved cheese on the top, and sprinkled with shredded lettuce and a tablespoon of salsa. On the side was an ounce of sour cream and jalapenos. It looked disgusting. We ate 1-2 nachos and ordered the \"sampler tray appetizer\" hoping it would be better. It was not. The manager accused us of eating all of the nachos before sending them back and still charged us for \"half of the nachos\". The only upside of this place was the secluded back room specifically for those who wanted to watch the world series. Food was horrible, service was \"ok\", management was horrible. Just Horrible. This bar needs John Taffer from Bar Rescue immediately. They are also RACIST.! Is it ironic that the only 2 African American groups in the bar that night had an unsatisfactory experience. A separate and unrelated couple had a similar experience to us as far as how we were treated that night (We spoke outside the building while leaving). I was also told by a random employee that I could not wear my hoodie (black nike hoodie with big red NIKE word across the front) inside the building. Others at the table beside us even debated that this wasn't True because they are frequent goers of the establishment and never had that issue themselves. Our waiter also kept standing near our table for about 20 minutes after we received the tab; as if she was monitoring us to make sure we do not leave without paying (keep in mind that we came to watch the world series which had an hour left in the game).  I will never go here again. I felt targeted and uncomfortable. I had to finish the last inning of the baseball game at home.. WHERE I FELT MORE WELCOMED!",

We wanted a nice, friendly place with food where we could watch the Carolina/Duke game and Steamers was our first pick!  We arrived at game time, our orders were quickly taken and drinks arrived very quickly.  The food is decent bar food.  We had the homemade chips for an appetizer and sandwiches.  There was a nice rivalry going in the bar but everyone was having fun with it.  People were friendly, staff was quick.  I loved that they offer free trivia games at your table so during breaks in the game action I played a little trivia.  Overall, we had a lovely evening out and really enjoyed watching the big game in such a fun atmosphere.  I can't believe any reviewer would think this place was overpriced - we had full dinner for two complete with appetizer and drinks and the bill was less than $25.00 including tip!",

    "text": "Well, Steamers is alright. I've been told it's a little bit of a Yesteryears 2.0 (I never got to enjoy the original, but I feel like I would have) and a few of the regulars have made this their new spot - but this will definitely just be a once in a while bar for me.   It's oddly laid out with multiple doorways, breaking it down into a game room (pool tables etc), more of a bar space, and then lots of tables - with 103 TVs lining the ceiling (no I didn't count, our server informed us of this). They even have TVs in the smoking area outside. The whole place was ridiculously clean, I was really quite surprised. They have karaoke on the weekends (why we were there), and although it took them a while to start calling our group's songs, it didn't seem like an unreasonable wait.   Service was pretty good, our server started out a little rough around the edges but by the end of the night I think he warmed up to us. The drinks were maybe slightly more expensive than anticipated (but they did have an okay beer special), but nothing was on the weak side, and he and the rest of the bar staff catered to our odd shot requests.   Other than the location, the fact that I can't wrap my head around the set-up is keeping me from really liking it. I'm sure during the day with different lighting and as more of a restaurant it probably has a completely different feeling, but for a random karaoke night - it's not too bad either (or if you need to watch twenty things at the same time).",

I have attended Weddings ,Receptions,Birthday Parties,Baby Shower's etc... and the staff always gives 100% to be sure the events are everything u want.  There is a closed in outside area for smoking w/TVs so u dont miss a thing.  Our favorite food choices are ,Wings,Chicken Salad,Macaroni Salad,Chicken Finger's and homemade Chips.

The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is fun.  The food isn't amazing... But it is a bar so you get what you would expect.

I have had great service the staff is very friendly, On my second visit the bartender already remembered my name...(and trust me I gave her no reason too the first time I visited lol)- but this place is True to what it is a neighborhood bar, serving it's regulars, tons of activities including darts, , karaoke, fooseball, as well as staples like cheap beer, and jello shots.

I said I had just talked to someone literally two minutes ago about to take my order but I needed to read the menu first.. then he proceeds to tell me I can make an order but I'd have to come in and place it.. for Togo!? What's the difference if I place it over the phone or go in and place it and then leave w the food. Either way I was gonna take the food home and it would have been easier to order over the phone and have it ready by the time I got there, then get there order it and then have to wait for them to prepare it and then go...

My first time in and within five minutes I met TJ, Beth, Renee' & David and they were all friendly and welcoming.  Everyone of them made sure I was in front of the TV I needed to be in front of with sound!  Yay!  They have at least 3 separate areas for Pittsburgh fans, Philadelphia Fans and I think Miami, too.    I think they have a fairly nice patio also with plenty of tv's.  That's where the smokers are, so I didn't make it out there.  They also have free wi-fi, which is great!  The food was good, too.  Crinkle Cut French fries came with my Rueben Wrap.  The wrap was on the small side, but the flavor was big!  The Popcorn Shrimp were well-cooked and came to the table without being gooey with residual oil.  They were yummy.  They have drink & food special every day.  They also do trivia, karaoke and other fun things throughout the week.  I don't think it was very expensive, maybe a little high for a small sandwich, but not unusually priced for Charlotte.  I hope I can get back in for the CrabLeg Special - that's an awesome deal.  I'm definitely glad to have met this great group of people in a great place to go and hang for some sports!",

So grab your favorite jersey and head on over to Steamers!!!",

    "text": "I came to Steamers once before for a job, and I told myself if I ever needed to watch a game this is where I'm coming. This place is right around the corner from my house and well, lets say they have a lot of TV's. It's a sports pub, I didn't expect less. So I came here to watch the Knicks play because of an Asian American player Jeremy Lin play and I didn't receive the game at home.  I ate the Philly Cheese Steak. The waiter came and asked me if I wanted tomatoes and lettuce, and I did however when they came back they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce and they brought it out on a plate instead. The tomatoes were fine, but the lettuce looked a little old. I drank a couple of beers and watched the game. The place had some pretty good 90's music and a good amount of country.   My roommate who went with me ordered a burger and said it was juicy and well cooked, so I can't really comment on what his thoughts were. (However, he does have the credentials because he's a student at Johnson and Wales and works in a kitchen) After we ate our entree, we ordered the nacho supreme. It wasn't bad. the lettuce still wasn't that fresh, but the portion size was okay. At 10 every weekend they have karaoke night.  Overall, if I come back here, I would just order a beer watch the game (as they had so many TV's just ask what you want to watch and they'll get your own TV) and then go home. Maybe get some nachos as it's not expensive at all. I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about with the prices were expensive. I didn't think it was expensive at all, but actually not priced badly at all.",

    "text": "I've honestly been looking for this place for the past 9 years living here in Charlotte. God bless Al Gore's internet and Yelp for this find.  I consider myself a mediocre social butterfly, so if there is a better dive bar in town I really do not know of it. Big fan dives. The coziness of the interior, along with bar food selection, and drink specials are phenominal.  TV's ALL OVER. You come here for football, I'd say you have a good chance of catching whatever game your looking to watch.  The food is good, not gastropub quality by any means. Drink specials seem more than decent.   That said, my favorite aspect to this bar- Friggin'. Eagles. Room. Love it. So yes, it would be accurate to say I'm an avid Eagles fan. This room was jampacked this past Saturday night for the Eagles loss against the Saints. (What's new, they blow it every year). But I did meet some real great people here, and we got to talk a little Eagles history. Not bad. You definitely won't find this anywhere else in the city, so if your an Eagles fan, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!  Other information:  They also have a Steelers room.  Eagles room is actually fairly kid friendly.",

    "text": "Before I begin, I have to say that five star reviews aren't something that I dole out like candy on October 31st, as I am very particular about granting an establishment the elusive five stars as there is nothing worse than going to a restaurant with five stars and soon thereafter you begin to wonder if you are actually in the right place (one of those \"maybe there is another location somewhere?\" type of moments).    Well, I am excited to say that Steamers has earned every single one of the five stars I am handing out and I can't believe I have actually found a sports bar to \"call home\"...  Last weekend, my 6 year old son and I were having some quality father/son time so we decided on the spur of the moment to find somewhere new to catch the Tarheels football game that was slated to kickoff at 12:30pm.    Now, we definitely enjoy the quality of life down in our neck of the woods in South Charlotte, but the sports bar options are mediocre at best and downright lame at worst, as sometimes it seems to take an act of congress to get a place to actually turn on a particular game (even if a place is practically empty), let alone play sound (why do they always seem to act shocked that people actually want to hear the game they are watching???).  So, now I always make sure to call a place beforehand to ask if they will be playing sound (although I have found that the response given is almost always yes, but then when we get there the sound is almost never turned on) as it drives me crazy to sit staring at a game with no sound (or even closed captioning), or even worse, with music playing in the background on a Saturday afternoon in a \"sports bar\".  Ok...now that I have that out of the way, let's get to the review of Steamers...  First, let me say that the drive wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be.  Smooth sailing all the way, no sitting in traffic, so the time flew by and we were there in no time.  It is actually set back a bit off the main road so if you weren't looking for it, you probably wouldn't even notice it, but believe me when I tell you it is definitely a place worth going out of your way to check out!  Walking in we were greeted by one of the managers and we felt right at home from the moment we walked in the front door.  I know this may sound cliche, but it had that Cheers vibe as everyone who worked there was very friendly and personable (without being intrusive or annoying).  Kinda felt like we were over at a friends house to catch a game, except none of my friends have close to 100 TV's!!!  Yes, you heard me...100 TV's...it was crazy and my 6 year old son was amazed at the sight (this is a great place for kids by the way as they were awesome with my little guy the entire time we were there and he gave it two thumbs up at the end of the day).   The coolest part was that they had different sections in the restaurant where you could have sound playing for one game and then in the section over there was sound playing for another game and you would never know it.    Yes, you heard me...THEY HAD SOUND!!!  In fact, they asked me what game I wanted to watch, pumped up the sound to the level I wanted and asked what games I wanted on around me too, it was awesome!  This place is everything a sports bar should be!  The manager said it doesn't matter what part of the country you are from and what team you are rooting for, he has enough TV's to make sure your game will be put on for you and he will get you SOUND!   This place has alumni viewing party central written all over it, as what more could you ask for???  And if that wasn't enough, they had plenty of pool tables, 3 Foosball tables, various video games (my son loves the putt putt golf game and actually scored a -2 for 18 holes!), lots of dart boards, and TV's...did I mention the 100 TVs??!!??!!  And believe it or not, they actually serve some pretty good food too!  We tried the nachos, quesadilla, wings, Philly cheese steak, and the cheesecake (hey, it was a guys day so we did it Cliff Huxtable style - token obscure TV reference often found in my reviews...this one refers to the episodes when he would pig out on the hoagies and chocolate soda when Claire was out of town) and all the food was definitely above average and priced very reasonably with better than average quality both in taste, promptness of service and overall experience.  The servers did a fantastic job from start to finish, always making sure my water was refilled without me having to ask and I never had to do the \"where is my server\" neck workout that many of us are all too familiar with.  The manager came by to check on us multiple times and even took the time to ask us for feedback which I thought was a nice touch.    This place was everything we could ask for in a sports bar...tons of TV's, family friendly atmosphere, great food, excellent service and a welcoming vibe that made us feel right at home...Welcome to the 5 star club Steamers..you definitely earned it!",

They have plenty of space and I think they are a watch area for many other teams as well. There's plenty of space and many groups can co-exist. I've seen karaoke set up here before, too, so there's something for everyone at Steamers.  Staff is wonderful and they are always very accommodating to our group. They purchased and display our team's banner. We always reserve a side room that has TV's everywhere so everyone gets a good view of the game. And one time when we were pretty far in a tournament, they brought out red jello shots for us to celebrate. We've had our watches at other places, but Steamers is only place that seems like they enjoy having us there.   If I'm going to be honest, food is okay. It's your typical bar food. Most of the time, I get wings and a veggie plate appetizer. The fried green beans though are one of the best I've had. My latest visit, I got a blackened chicken salad which was again just okay. Chicken was a little dry and salad was pretty basic. Prices for food seem to be a little high for what you get. Also, when my hubby comes, he doesn't drink alcohol and will go through several rounds of diet Coke. After the first refill, they always charge for additional refills. Most places give DDs a break on this.   Other than that, a pretty fun place, especially if you enjoy sports.",

There's a whole separate room with lots of tvs & Eagles decor including our SuperBowl Banner. The room gets packed early so you usually have to get here at least an half hour to an hour before the game starts just depends who they are playing. Eagle fans that have never been will love it, feels like being at a game, singing the fight song for touchdowns and all.  The service is pretty good especially with how packed it gets but I have seen & heard some rude servers luckily I never had one. They check on you regularly and your drinks and food comes out at a pretty normal speed. Only been a few times that I have had to waved down a server and they were really busy days. The food is regular bar food, a bit pricey but I've seen worst. I haven't had anything I didn't like yet, nothing to ring home about but overall good food. They do have good drink prices though.",

Don't waste the time to get dressy...come relax inside and karaoke from Wed-Sat, or walk to the back part of the spread out footprint to play some pool.  There is also trivia on the TV's 24/7, just ask the staff for a game board.  There is also a large patio for smokers, or those of us with DOGGOS!  The food here is really quite tasty, believe it or not....and you really can't ask for much more from a small, low key, dive sports bar.  Their French Dip sammie is BOMB, and their Potato Soup is nothing to be trifled with!  I've had the chicken quesadilla too and it is also pretty tasty!!!!  One of my favorite things here is the staff though.   Everyone is super laid back, and very removed from any type of BS.  This is NOT the spot to come if you're trying to party or dance the night away ... this is the spot for a quick late night bite...or the late night spot for service industry to catch a beverage after a long shift.  I miss Dan - best server ever.  And it's pretty great when Thomas is behind the bar.  But honestly, I've not had any bad experiences here due to the waitstaff.   I just wish they carried more spirits brands from the RNDC line.",

I went for the Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys game last week, when the Eagles defeated the Cowboys 37 to 9, and I must say they weren't prepared for such a big crowd.    It was very busy, I mean very, VERY busy. - The fan area was packed, and the waitresses weren't nice with an attitude.  - The bar had only one bartender. - I ordered grilled chicken teriyaki wrap. I got it after more than 75 min, and it was ok.  Steamers is a typical bro sports bar, with probably over 100 TV, and few drinks specials. But I don't I'll be returning.

We have gone past this place a few times and weren't really sure what it was all about. So we decided to stop by on a Friday for date night. The restaurant itself is huge and has a few separate rooms which is awesome! There are pool tables, dart boards, a million TVs, some video game like games, and much more! So there is plenty to do when just hanging out for the night. Plus they have karaoke!!! Yes please!  The food was typical bar food, nothing outstanding but good enough. And the drink prices were pretty reasonable as well which I definitely didn't mind! They have specials daily so be sure to check those out as well.

    "text": "Great dive bar find in Charlotte. Tons of TVs to watch all types of sports, but you definitely need to come here if you're an Eagles fan. The atmosphere here is unmatched to anything outside of Philadelphia.   They have a lot of great specials. Every night there's different drink and food specials and different activities like trivia or karaoke. It's definitely a fun place to come.   I don't necessarily ever come here for the food, but it gets the job done after having a few drinks.",

    "text": "This is still one of my favorite dives in Charlotte. Such an underrated sports bar. I love to come up here to watch playoff hockey. They have over 100 TVs, a ton of great specials throughout the week, and pretty solid bar food.   My order here is always different depending on my mood. I'm a sucker for any menu that offers fried mushrooms. I love the sweet & spicy wing sauce. The stuffed baked potatoes are great.   There is always something going on here. Cornhole, pool and darts leagues, foosball tournaments. Karaoke on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays. Trivia on Wednesday nights, bingo on Thursdays.   Shelbi and the entire staff do a great job here. You'll see a ton of regulars. Everyone is so nice, so friendly. If you end up on the patio, you'll find yourself in a conversation with strangers. Makes sense, their tag line on the website is \"Where Old Friends Make New Friends.\"",

They have great drink specials and the food isn't half bad either!   If you're an Eagles fan, this is your bar on game days--but they have like 100 TV's in there so regardless, you can watch whatever team you'd like to route for.   The staff is friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is fun. It's a nice laid-back spot to have a cheap beer and watch some football!",

    "text": "I wasn't really sure what to give steamers as far as a rating goes. I wasn't in love with it, but I also can't say really anything bad about it either. I really only had two small complaints about the restaurant. Number one, I felt the food was a little expensive for what you got.  All the food was good, just a little pricey in my opinion for standard bar food.  Number two, I felt the crowd was 40 and up. Not necessarily a bad thing just wasn't my cup of tea.  Other than that though, this is a really cool bar. They have a little bit of everything. If you love pool and darts this is your Macha! They have endless dartboards and four or five pool tables throughout the bar. Countless amounts of TVs so it's perfect for game day also.",

    "text": "I've been here multiple times and always left with an unsure feeling. Tonight it took me all of 5 minutes to be lividly anger. Our server has told us that tonight because it is game night we are unable to have tap water and have to buy bottled water. Been here before and they serve tap water... hello this is the US not Europe! Don't be so desperate for money that you do that to guests on the ONE NIGHT you are busy. Also serving water to guest that are drinking keeps them buying more drinks, hello common sense!   Then there is the service... I have been here for 10 mins and our witness (EllenF) was so rude to us about waters, the table next to us said they ordered boneless wings and the witness said \"I wrote it down as you said it and that's not what you said so I guess I'll just take that out of my tip!\" Then she comes to take our order and I asked for the tater tot seasoning on the side and she told me \"man the kitchen is going to hate you\" WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU WOMAN! If you hate your job so much then change it but you can't talk to guest like that!!    We ordered 15 wings and tater tots with seasoning on the side. Our order came out with 11 wings. Mhm... interesting. They fixed this quickly but we also paid for 3 flavors and they did a combo of the 3 flavors on all the wings. Not good esp when someone is paying for extra flavors.   After our dinner we had a patron tell us they charge for waters on game day because some visitor team fans were coming in and ordering nothing but waters. Don't punish your locals for poor judgement on visitors.",

I googled and this place came up with good reviews. It didn't disappoint. Dave greeted everyone that came in and introduced himself and remembered names. He accommodated us by having the audio on for the game. We ordered the veggie tray, garlic parm wings, and the mac and cheese bites. Everything was delicious. Ladies, the restroom is clean. That's always huge for me. This place seemed really spacious with multiple rooms, though we just stayed at our table. If we lived in the area, I know we would visit frequently!",

There are many tvs in different areas of the bar.    The service is good.  The bartenders are friendly and attentive.  They are talkative and willing to make different drinks to your individual liking.  They have daily specials on drinks and shots, which are pretty good and fairly strong.    Overall this is a good place to come, especially if you like sports and pool.  There is plenty of room to spread out, play a good game of pool, listen to music, and watch sports.  There is an outside area that I haven't got to try out due to the cigarette smoking.  Just not my thing.",
