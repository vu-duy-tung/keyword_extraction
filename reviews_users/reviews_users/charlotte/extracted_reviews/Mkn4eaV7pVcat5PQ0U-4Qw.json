    "text": "A slight step up from your typical greasy spoon breakfast place. Portions are huge, even for sides! The menu is also quite large and all items are served all day.  I ordered the farmers wrap with a side of grits and hash browns. Wrap was OK and the hash browns were alright, but both suffered from a lack of seasoning. Next time, I will order the farmer's omelet which was a bit tastier. I will also be sure to request the hash browns be served crispy. Husband also ordered a side of turnip greens which seemed to be just thawed frozen greens stuck in a bowl with no seasoning.  Even with these \"notes for next time,\" I still feel that this is a banging breakfast spot to which I would enthusiastically return to. Our table mates ordered the French toast which looked amazing and I was impressed by the cook and portion size of the side of bacon. Also, fresh squeezed juice will get you brownie points every time. Coffee was good too!",

It's pretty inexpensive for the quality of the food that you get as well. The only downside is the wait since it gets pretty crowded, especially on weekends. I'd say on average at least 20 mins of wait time on Saturday/Sunday and maybe 10 mins on weekdays.",

I don't know about you but that's the last thing I want to smell while eating.  I recommend a stronger exhaust fan in both!!!!!  With that being said, the food was great and so was the service.

My wife and I were searching for a place to go to breakfast, because we've really been trying to pay attention to what we eat and work on losing a few pounds. We decided to give this place a try, and I ordered the egg white omelet with cheese and sausage, and my wife ordered a garden omelette that was with egg whites too. The food was really great, and the service was good. I look forward to trying some more stuff on the menu, including some of the baked goods which were in great abundance at the front and look very tasty.",

The biscuit would have been a hockey puck if it was black. Sent it back and the replacement wasn't much better (1:00pm. Not sure how many days ago the biscuit was made).  Waitress was nice, and she brought the food out quickly. She checked back once to see if everything was alright. I kinda beat the biscuit on the table a couple of times without saying a word. She grabbed it and went back to the kitchen with it.  Typical Greek restaurant, and crowded for lunch. I want to try their other dishes that looked good on the menu and that other diners were having. I have had their breakfast, which was average. Price is right for their food.",

We got a cup of chicken noodle soup for $2.25. We also got the caramel mocha Belgium waffle ($5.25) and that was AMAZING. It was very different and the waffle was light and fluffy just the way I like it. I am definitely coming back for this! (I think it's only served on Saturdays). I RECOMMEND. We got the 3 berry chocolate chip pancake ($7.95). These pancakes are large. We couldn't finish it but it was delicious. The service was nice. Everyone made sure we got what we needed and treated us respectfully. I don't really remember our server's name (I think Vivian or something...), but she was super kind and helped clean our mess. I would definitely recommend. Prices are fair and portions are good to share.",

There menu is huge and everything is made fresh to order, expect a crowd because it's always busy. They are only open 6am till 3pm you can get breakfast all day.  My mom got a cheeseburger and french fries it, she fully enjoyed it, had to get a to go box it was a massive burger. I had the western skillet ham, green peppers onion hash browns, eggs and cheese it was scrumptious. And the grits were creamy, perfectly cooked deliciousness! The only 2 small issues I had were our waitress had a hard time understanding questions we asked because of a language barrier. And the driveway is CRAZY hard to get into the restaurant sits up on a hill crossing Monroe road is dangerous and then the dip on the way up can cause serious drag on the bottom of your car. I still highly recommend eating here you will be happy you did!",

    "text": "This is my second (and last visit) to Stacks.  My first visit was fantastic a few months ago.  This visit should have really gotten zero stars.....because from start to finish it bombed.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars this go around is because the food actually tasted good.  We arrived at 10:08 on a Saturday morning.  Put our names on the list and were told that it would be a 25 minute wait.  (We waited outside...and they were calling parties from the wait list outside too). 40 minutes later, after not being called....i walked in and looked at the wait list at the hostess stand.  Our name had already been marked off....and so had the next 7 or 8 people after us.  When I said something....the waitress admitted that she forgot to call us and take us to the table.  We were then seated immediately.  When we were seated...it took a other 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a waitress who seemed dazed and confused.  We heard her apologize to several tables around us....and I thought to myself \"this can't be good\".   She got our drink order and eventually showed up with that....then made us wait another 5 minutes or so (after disappearing) to come take our order.  Something told me that I should ask her not to forget to put our order in....but I didnt.  That was a BAD CALL......because, guess what?.   SHE FORGOT TO PUT OUR ORDER IN.  People seated after us had already gotten food and eaten and ready to go.  Not us.  I asked to speak to the manager and shared our experience with him.  He listened and was polite enough.....and he said \"hold on for a minute and let me go check on something\".   That took a while....i was wondering if he left to check the back door so he could run away.  He returned to our table with a plate of Greek goodies and some dried bagel chips to help smooth things over with us.  To me, that was not enough.    I am a hairstylist. .. and if anyone has ever had a bad experience or complained....i would take care of a portion of their ticket.  What he offered me was like the equavalent of offering my clients a few salon magazines and some K-Cups for them to take when they left.  Kinda insulting.  When we got to the cash register to pay....we had to wait again.  No cashier to be seen anywhere.  When she asked \"How was everything?\"  She seemed shocked at my reply of \"You asked the wrong person that question this morning....cause it bombed from start to finish.\"       By the time we left it was 11:55.  Almost 2 hours later.  That's too long for any breakfast service  I am sorry that my second experience was so dumpy....because I really liked the food.....but I would never subject myself to this type of experience ever again.",

    "text": "I told the parents of one of my students that I love to eat and try new places so they recommended Stacks, so we gave it a try this past Saturday. I had the caramel mocha waffle, which was supposed to be a cappuccino waffle with chocolate chips on top with a caramel drizzle and whipped cream. I think they may have forgotten the caramel on mine because I had eaten about a quarter of the waffle and realized I hadn't tasted any. But overall, it was a good waffle, it didn't knock off my socks, but I ate it all along with the turkey sausage patties. My son had a burger with bacon and steak fries...I love steak fries and theirs didn't disappoint. He said the burger was good. My Love ordered and omelette and it was also very good. The wait staff was extremely pleasant, and someone came around with a tray of samples while we waited to be seated...and I wasn't mad! Whatever it was, it was moist and yummy. Their dessert display looked amazing as well. I'd definitely give this place another shot in the future, and so should you!",

I was worried that I'd end up with a dry piece of chicken but thankfully it was really juicy and good. Hubby had a lamb gyro which he liked as well. He wanted a side of coleslaw which he usually prefers to be mayonnaisey/vinegary, but the waitress mentioned it was more sweet because the chef put his own twist on it. He was hoping to be able to try a bit before deciding whether to order it which she did she could do, but would put fries in just in case. He ended up liking it and switched to the cole slaw. Would definitely come back again and try the breakfast menu next time.",

We waited over 30 minutes for our food, which we believe was related to our server, Renne, who was very inattentive. We watched as she stood around talking to people while our food was most likely in the kitchen. Another server delivered it when she was in middle of a conversation. Not to mention that we had waited quite a while for her to come and take our order in the first place.  It's too bad because I've just moved her from NY and am looking for great places to eat. I most likely will not return.",

We were amazed at the traffic coming through this place from the time you pull into the parking lot, the place is congested so be patient because you will probably circle the parking lot a few times to find a spot. We waited about 30min for 2 people for breakfast on a Saturday and it was worth it...it's probably wise to have someone from your party hop out and put your name on the list while you're circling the lot!   Okay on to the food...I had a basic breakfast with grits, hash browns, sausage and a biscuit. Of course I didn't finish it all because they definitely give you diner sized portions but it was solid. My friend had the corned beef hash with grits and she LOVED it so it's definitely a must for hash lovers! My advice is to share a meal of you and your party have the same taste otherwise enjoy!",

The bananas were freshly sliced and not brown or overly ripe. The pecans were toasted and lightly covered with brown sugar and cinnamon. I would definitely order this again. My friend had the short Stacks pancakes, one egg and a turkey sausage. The eggs looked a little too hard but maybe she liked them that way. The pancakes were medium side and she seems to enjoy eating them. She couldn't finish all three so she took half home. My son had a chicken wrap, of which I tasted, and it was soooo good. He and I both said it was one of the best chicken wraps we have had at all the restaurants we have eaten. The chicken was well seasoned, baked and tender. It was huge! He ordered a large glass of freshly squeezed O.J., which I had to at least taste it! lol. Another win!  Can't wait to take my husband when we are back in Charlotte and my other friend. I know they will both enjoy the food.  We had to wait about 30-40 minutes but it was worth the wait.",

I just arrived home after trying Stacks for the second time. The first time I went with two friends and had one of their day's specials, a Cajun shrimp wrap. It was to die for. It was so good, I had to bring my husband back to check this place out. The hostess seemed nice, but confused or maybe overwhelmed. We we told there would be a ten-minute wait. No big deal, whatever. Packed place. A couple minutes later, the man that I have been assuming is the owner (friendly dark-haired hype man with an accent?) comes by, says \"just to two of you?\" in a surprised manner, and seats us. It was almost as if he was wondering why she had us waiting. Strange. On the way to our seats, he asked if we had ever tried the french toast. He recommended their special of Cannoli cream french toast, and I thought to myself, \"Sure, it's made out of yesterday's bread. Why would you not push it?\" However, the longer I thought about it the more it made sense. I had already tried and loved the savory-lunch route here. Why not go sweet-breakfast route this time? Plus he just seems so nice, and like he genuinely cares about your experience. I figured he wouldn't lead me wrong. Yeah, he didn't lead me wrong. My cannoli french toast was ah-mazing. It was the most delicious sweet breakfast I have ever tasted. The cream inside was perfectly sweet and had a lot of substance, sticking well between the toast layers and adding a great textural element to the just-firm-enough toast. The strawberries on top were tart and a smart touch, the tartness really cutting through the cream. Refreshing. My husband ordered shrimp and grits which were also some of the best we have tasted outside of our own kitchen. The like sauce topping the grits tasted meaty and homey, like a red eye gravy. He was pleased, and he is a picky shrimp and gritter. A lot of reviews mention the lacking service. I have to say, it's not the best i've had but it's far from the worst. Our waitress did forget our order and have to come back. When our waitress forgot to return to re-fill our drinks, the owner noticed and came to do it himself. A really sweet touch- not something an owner has to do. I like Stacks Kitchen a whole lot. I've already agreed with a few friends that this will be out go-to meet up spot in Matthews. They deserve our regular business.",

Chose harvest salad with huge piece of chicken breast, cranberries,  pecans and a bit of goat cheese.  Left off the bacon and had dressing on the side.  Good size portion, super service, nice atmosphere was quiet enough to converse and not so quiet you could hear any other conversations.  Cannot believe I have driven by a hundred times and never stopped.  Bonus....saw a high school friend from Ohio having lunch with a friend. We caught up and chatted for a bit.",

    "text": "This place is not all that it's cracked up to be.  We saw the good ratings and decided to try it today.  We first started by going to the rest room.  Both the men's and the women's were nasty.  We walked to the table and the floors were sticky and had napkins and food on them.  Yuck!  The table and the chairs were sticky as well.  The waiter was great!  Great attitude and very attentive.  The guy who brought out our food was also great.  The guy who sold us the pastries we purchased after the meal was great.  The only reason we give this place a three star rating is because of the service because the food was not good.  I had the BLT salad.  Very little bacon.  The salad dressing really didn't have any flavor.  How does one mess up a salad?  Hmmm? SMH!  My son had the gyro.  Why make a gyro if you're not going to \"make a gyro\"?  It was bland and it was the kind of gyro with the precut meat slices so it wasn't really authentic.  My mom had a cheeseburger.  It was only ok.  Both of them had fries which were nothing special.  The lemon meringue pie was abysmal.  I mean just not right.  The consistency of the lemon part of the pie wasn't even right not to mention the flavor.  Tossed that right in the trash!  Needless to say we will not be returning.",

We've gone back and forth on thumbs up and thumbs down and after our last visit have decided that in the future we'll be less picky about the table location and more picky about which waiter/waitress we have. There are two, one woman and one man, who are amazing and get it right and are on top of things. There are others who, let's just be nice and say they are NOT on top of things.   My husband was in the mood for traditional breakfast food at 7:30 in the morning...but when I saw they had pastitsio...nothing else was going to fit the bill. So that's what I got and wowza...it was amazing...featured in future dreams level of amazing. The custardy bechamel sauce was blanketed over perfectly seasoned beef and a layer of pasta without it being a heavy pasta dish. It was hot without being a volcano in my mouth and enough for two meals. Served with a Greek side salad and that was dressed perfectly!  The eggs and sausage my husband ordered were spot on. The kitchen knows how to craft eggs over medium...to many let them sit on the flat top too long. Not Stacks...they were both fabulously done!  His meal came with bread and he opted for rye. Thick cut, double toasted and seeded perfection. You can buy loaves of their amazing breads to take home as well.   The owners are very nice and personable and active participants, not just observing and barking to the staff.   While the location may not scream out quality food and fabulous menu......what comes out on the plate surely does!  Give them a try and be prepared to wait....but it's well worth the time!",

The place is really warm and inviting.  The staff is friendly and the menu has something for everyone.  My wife had the banana nut waffle and a side of bacon.  I had a special on this Wednesday, the Southwest Chicken & Waffle.  So look, I realize I'm a New England guy moving to the south and I might be punched for saying this but I'm not a big sausage gravy fan.  That said, the chicken and waffles I had was really different.  The chicken was smothered in a chorizo sausage gravy topped with dried cranberries.  It was INCREDIBLE.  I love chorizo anyway and the spice complimented the waffle and syrup really well.  The waffle itself was simple and well executed.  My wife is typically a slow eater and she demolished her waffle and bacon in record time.  We'll be back, possibly as early as tomorrow for cinnamon buns to go.  They're the size of a your head!  There's a local diner we love in our hometown, and Stacks might be our new go-to in our new city.",

Place is small, cozy and practical.  The wait is a bit long considering the food is great and eventhough the location is lowkey you still get lots of clientele.  This place is always clean the the staff - although busy, are friendly and courteous as well as efficient and patient .  I love the banter between the staff and the regulars.  They will always find time for you even though the place is packed.  This is a rare place that does fresh squeezed orange juice.  It is done by a machine, but you can watch the process up-close since the juicer is displayed as soon as you walk in.  Along with a great display case of desserts and treats. Overall I fell in love with this place and look forward to coming here for a memorable experience every time.",

    "text": "We went to Stacks Kitchen one Sunday morning for breakfast, with low expectations.  It's in what barely constitutes a strip mall in a so-so part of town.  The restaurant always seemed like it had a lot of cars out front, though, and the reviews were pretty good on Yelp.    Upon first entry into the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was much cleaner and nicer than I anticipated.  We were a party of five, so we had to wait a little longer than others.  The tables and booths in the sunlit front (and, in my opinion, much nicer) dining room all only seat four people.  Unfortunately, that not only extended our wait time, but also limited our dining room options.  We were seated in the back dining room, which is ok, but doesn't have the cheerful ambiance that the main dining room has.  It felt more like a church basement that's been set up for an event than an actual diner/restaurant like the main dining room in front.    As one can see from the menu (and the HUGE dessert display case as you walk in), it's a Greek-owned diner/restaurant.  The menu was pretty extensive; there were lots of entrees I wanted to try (which makes it good for repeat business).  I opted for the Florentine Omelette with spinach, tomatoes and feta.  It was made with four (!!) eggs; the portions were definitely a good size, so no one should leave hungry.    We'll definitely come back.  I just need to come next time with at least one less person.",

I always eat my share of pancakes and will certainly drink my share of coffee.  I am granting 4 stars because the food is good.    I will note that the seat cushions in the booths (maybe all) are in dire need of an upgrade.  They are well worn.  In addition, when someone sits in the neighboring booth (behind you), you feel every movement.  This became aggravating during my recent visit.  I switched sides with my daughter only to have someone come in 5 minutes later and sit behind me.    I would love it if they would small plate breakfasts on the weekends like they do during the week.  I really can't--and don't want to--eat all the food they bring.  And I hope they learn to keep the biscuits fresh even if it is one hour before closing.",

They opened at 7:00, and we got there at 7:15 - good thing since the lines can be long based on the other reviews. There were 3 cop cars in the parking lot, and I figured the cops must know what's up, so we were excited.  It's definitely a down home kitchen sort of feel, and our waitress was sweet and fantastic. Our food came out fast, too. We both got the traditional breakfast with basic meat ($5.95 each) but did it totally different - I got bacon, scrambled eggs, wheat toast, and hash browns, and he got sausage patties (they have links, too), over-medium eggs, a biscuit, and grits. He said everything was just as you'd expect, about average. My bacon was so tough that I didn't even eat all 3 strips, which is a rarity for me, and the hash browns didn't have much taste to them. The eggs and toast were good, but it's pretty hard to mess up eggs and toast.",

I ordered the Athenian skillet and pancakes and my husband ordered the south or the border omelette with French toast. The skillet was amazing 5 stars. My only True complaint is that the pancakes were tasteless. I believe if they were thinner then they would have taste better and my husband said the same about the French toast. I do believe this place is worth the drive if you live in the Charlotte area.  I just feel that if an establishment is going to serve breakfast all day then their pancakes and French toast have to improve.",

Most dishes come with a choice of hash browns, oatmeal or grits, as well as toast or biscuit. The omelette fillings were fresh, the poached eggs perfectly poached.

There was a bit of a wait when we came in around 11:30am on a Sat, but we circumvented the 20-30min wait by going to the counter which is open seating.   The waitress we had was nice and came to get our drink orders quickly, but then it took a while for her to come back and take our food orders. It took a ridiculously long time for us to get our food! Seriously, over 30mins...and this was after I asked our waitress twice to check on our food. The first time she just forgot, which was after about 20mins, the second time, which was just at 30mins, she said it would still be a few more mins. These were not complicated orders, so the wait time for the food was disappointing. I hate waiting for food, especially when there is no reason for the exorbitant wait time. This is breakfast, not steaks or souffles.   As for the quality, it was fine. Nothing amazing. I had the florentine benedict and the hollandaise was decent. I will say, you do get a lot of food with your breakfast order. With my benedict I got a side of grits and english muffins. The grits were pretty tasty, but I think it is a felony if you mess up grits this far into the South.  It also took a ridiculously long time for the waitress to process our payment. The card was sitting on the counter a full 10mins before we finally had to tell the waitress it was there, even though she literally passed by it a number of times. Even then, she had someone else process it...so they may need to work on their time management for food delivery & payment processing. Because even if the food were exemplary, the time it took to get it and pay for it was ridiculous and definitely affected the enjoyment of the meal.",

It was all cooked to order and the whole experience came off without a hitch.  They do diner good (yes, I know poor grammar).  My preference for a great diner, however, is for something with that extra kick.  Zada Jane's has some quirky ideas on omelets, Flying Biscuit rips some slammin' riffs on eggs, and Midnite Diner simply kicks butt as an extraordinary diner.  Nobody beats their sausage gravy, but Stacks, well, you came close.  Super clean.  Super friendly.  Super prices.  Great local family restaurant.  Just arrive early  (or late) to beat the crowds.",

The links were chode links, not the regular grocery store links(check pictures). It was impressive. Granted it was a dollar or two more expensive than other breakfast joints, but it was worth it for the quality meats. Service was great people kept stopping by to make sure we were taken care of. There may be a wait for breakfast and brunch. Get there early. Would recommend it.",

Salads... fruits.... pot pies, shrimp & grits, then fresh baked desserts to blow your diet. The staff is very friendly and personable. You get the feeling everyone comes here once a week and they'll know you on a first name basis in no time. The food was delicious. Everyone at my table was full and pleased with their food, especially my mom who loved her fruit bowl. It's difficult to discern from the picture, but the bowl was deep.

We put our names on a list and waited patiently, the nice man that greeted us up front told us we were able to sit at the bar if we wanted to because there were two seats available. We sat there for about 15 minutes without being greeted or given a menu. A server randomly gave us some waters and said we'd be greeted soon. Another 5-10 minutes pass by and still no server... a server finally asks us if we're ready to order and we were let her know we still didn't have our menus. She gets us menus and returns to take our orders, the food came out quickly but we didn't have any silverware so we had to wait 5 more minutes for our server to come by and give us some.  My friend ordered the French toast and she said it tasted like some type of meat .. maybe because of where they cook it, I'm not sure. But I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and some hash browns. The bagel was great and fluffy I could tell it was fresh and the hash browns were good as well (huge portion for a great price). The service was terrible (from the server) but after getting our food we were out of there quickly and my bagel sort of made up for it. The cashier and the man that greeted us when we first walked in were very nice.",

Call me goofy but this is a pet peeve of mine when dining at lunch by myself. I want to get in and get out. Please fix to make this the perfect breakfast lunch spot!",

They have delicious looking desserts too, but we haven't tried any of them.  We take all of our visiting guests here and they love it too.  The portions are quite large, sometimes we take home leftovers yummmm.  The prices are reasonable and the owners are incredibly kind and welcoming.  The waitstaff is punctual and will recommend dishes to you if you can't decide.  I love their little high top bar, they list specials on board above it which is really nice.  It gets really and I mean REALLY busy on the weekends, so you have to beat the rush of weekend crowds.  I love the skillets and the french toast.  My cousin had the eggs Benedict and  she ate the entire thing, and she is tiny.  So she definitely loved it.  It's a hidden gem in the Matthews area.",

I ordered the egg Benedict and I have never had a hollandise sauce that tasted this good. They also had their own fresh made bread for sale. My husbands patty melt was wonderful.

The fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome I love pulp so if you don't, stay away from the fresh squeezed. My daughter and mother ordered the pancakes and they loved them. They were light and fluffy very homemade. My other daughter ordered fresh toast it wasn't as good as the pancakes and nothing like New Jersey dinners. There are other places with better french toast. The egg batter wasn't soaked in enough by the bread. I ordered the two eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The bacon was very good a little salty but good. The eggs wasn't nothing exciting they were eggs. The hash hashbrown however is a different story I will never order them again. Our overall experience was awesome I would recommend this place I will just order something different the next time.",

Honestly from the outside or street it doesn't look like my hand givens the name could easily be mistaken for a strip club... There are no windows.  They offer typical diner fare and an abundance of pastries and fresh squeezed juice.  The juice is sweet... Almost suspiciously sweet.  The service was fast like you would expect in a diner.  The food was ok... What you would expect in a diner but nothing mind blowing.  I'm guessing the long lines are more because there aren't any other diner type places in the area but again, it wasn't bad.  I personally wouldn't wait in line to go there but if you are into diners with ok food and LARGE portions, Stacks is a go to.",

The \"meat\" loaf barely qualified as meat. It had the consistency of mush and absolutely no meat, onion or any flavor except maybe condensed milk??? Odd flavor and texture. The mashed potatoes and gravy had the same odd flavor. As I said the closest flavor may have been canned condensed milk. She didn't finish it and sent it back. The fried okra was ok. My hash browns and eggs were fine. Pretty hard to mess up! The corned beef hash looked ok, but the only thing I could taste was onion. I like onion, but it had NO corned beef flavor at all. I will say that the service was good and the did take the meatloaf off the bill. I may try them again, but .... not sure.",

They give you very generous portions, the food is delicious, and the staff is great. If it's Saturday or Sunday, you should consider getting there before 9 because the wait can get really long!! There is always most definitely going to be a wait if you come on the weekend during breakfast/brunch time. They make pastries and fresh squeezed orange juice also. Pancakes and waffles are huge, fluffy and delicious. The Nova Scotia platter is one of my favorites (similar to lox bagel, only more like a deconstructed one with salad). The salmon eggs Benedict is also delicious! I feel like you just need to try everything. Prices are very reasonable too, majority of dishes are under $10!",

The corned beef hash was the best hash that I have ever had and the pancakes were delicious and tasted like homemade pancakes. The whole meal just tasted like delicious comfort food. The service was great and the atmosphere was great too. The place was full of friendly people and great smelling food. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who wants a good meal for a great price! Will definitely be back with friends.",

There is a pastry case in the front of the restaurant with freshly made cookies, muffins, bagels, breads and other treats.   They offer seasonal pancakes and waffles that will stimulate your salivary glands just the same as Pavlov's Dog just by reading the description on the menu.   You must order the orange juice. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and made to order!    My go-to order is the Stacks French Toast. How is it made?  Fresh Hallah bread is slice 2 inches thick and then dredged through an egg mixture and cooked. Whatever flavor you order, it always comes served hot and with fresh whipped cream.",

I tell the waitress to check and she tells me it's coming out \"soon\"   Then she spends the next 20 minutes going back and forth to check in the kitchen and repeating to me soon, soon soon  - meaning they hadn't even started my order yet.

    "text": "We had a week day off and wanted to enjoy a nice breakfast without the kids. Usually we go to Cracker Barrel which is always good food and customer service! However, my wife talked me into trying Stacks because she and her girlfriend ate at Stacks before and had a decent experience.     The wait time was minimal.  When we got seated we ordered water with lemons. Our waitress Maglena, I think is how you spell her name, brought us water, but no lemons. I understand that waiters/waitresses have other people to wait on as well, so no biggie. However,  when asked a second time for a simple request like lemons, you need to expeditiously get that customers needs taken care of!  Customer service 101.   After taking our order, still no lemons,  a few minutes later the manager (George) came around to see how things are going, I stated we've asked for lemons twice with no success, he apologized and immediately went and got us lemons which is what should've happend earlier.    When the food came out, which required syrup, we waited for a few more minutes hoping our waitress Maglena or the person who brought the food out would bring some syrup back...common sense right, but no one did...Maglena's attitude was not pleasant from the beginning and just got worse!  Once again the manager (George) came to check on us and to see if we needed anything.  I told him it would be nice to have syrup with my pancakes and my wife's French toast.  He apologized again and immediately went to get us some syrup. At this point I was ready to leave.   Anyway, Maglena brought our check and after reviewing the check there were charges that she failed to mention when we ordered.  At checkout the cashier went to get her so she could explain the details of our check and at that point she mentioned what the extra charges were for.  I told her/them you may want to explain ANY extra charges prior to completing the order going forward, because you never told us.  The food was equivalent to the special price, not much flavor.     The only reason why I didn't rate them 0 stars was because of George, trying to make things right. Unfortunately, the damage was done. Hopefully, she will learn that each customer is very valuable, especially in the restaurant industry and personal feelings have nothing to with business!  YOU and I know exactly what I mean.",

My husband called at 10 am on Sunday told them we would be coming at 12:30 with 6 people and asked if they took reservations.  The hostess said they did not take reservations but we didn't need to call-ahead since there would not be a long wait at 12:30.    So after church we drove the 20 minutes there and found a 40 minute wait.  I said to the hostess we were told there would be hardly any wait at 12:30 so we didn't need to call-ahead and she turned to the other hostess and said, \"Did you tell them that?\"  The other hostess shrugged and said, \"Yes\".  The first hostess said, \"I don't know why she said that since it's Sunday.\"  They offered no apologies.  Unfortunately my children were very hungry and there was not a safe place for them to wait 40 minutes (inside was full of people standing and waiting and outside full of the same, only spot to stand would have been a busy parking lot).   At this point we decided to just eat something at home, much to everyone's disappointment.    I do not fault them for being busy.  It is good for them that they are busy.  But they need to be honest with customers.  I would not have driven over there with hungry children if they had told me from the beginning the wait would be long.   They also need to have better customer service manners when they have made a mistake.",

My absolute favorite meal is their French toast. It has a little bit of \"you'll come back for more\" seasoning in it, but my goodness you'll think you're in French toast heaven whilst dining on these delicious slices of magic. The wait time can be a bit extreme on  the weekends but I mean, it's Stacks, so yeah, You deal. If you're a resident of the Matthews area and have not yet been here. Shame on you. Go now.",

    "text": "Well, we went back and I asked the waitress if I could order something special and she said I could. I wanted the corned beef hash and eggs but I wanted the corned beef hash smothered over the rye toast and the two eggs I wanted poached on top of that and all of it smothered I m hollandaise sauce. It came out with such a small amount of corned beef hash and hollandaise sauce that it looked very dry with all the bread hanging out around the sides. I asked why I got so little as my wife had much more as she ordered the same thing minus the hollandaise sauce so I asked for a little more. The waitress got the manager and he said that it was a eggs benedict and that they weigh out the amount of corned beef. When I said that I did not order an eggs benedict he wanted to argue with me. I said listen, I ordered the exact same thing as did my wife only I wanted it stacked on top of my toast with some hollandaise sauce. I would have more than been willing to pay the extra for the hollandaise sauce but instead he sent me a plate of corned beef on the side and to my amazement they charged me another $5.95. Now the food was good and I ate almost all that was laid out before me but still. I know what I ordered and to have a manager stand and argue over that with a resturant full of patrons to me is beyond reproach. To me it is a great example of when a bussiness is enjoying enough success that if and when anyone has an issue they are treated with reproach and somewhat hostility. It took close to 20 minutes just to get our check. And then it was all but throwed at us. My worst experience at any Charlotte area restaurant to date. Sorry for the book but felt compelled to write this as no customer should ever be treaded in such a manner nor charged extra for the restaurants mistake.",

Explained owner told me last year after waiting an hour for a table, giving up was OUR LOSS.

I rarely get to enjoy an early morning sit down meal on my days off, because I detest getting up early when I don't need to. That means I can only look at other people's brunch pics and say to myself, \"One day.\"  That day finally came. And I was presented with the more glorious pieces of French Toast you could imagine. Word of advice, go with the small stack. I was not only hungry, but a bit greedy, and I still couldn't finish it off. One of the slices had to be 2 inches high. This is the real deal. The place is packed, and there is no surprise as to why that is. All I had was French toast, but my friend had other breakfast options like eggs, grits, sausage, etc. You can't go wrong. Because of that French Toast, next month I'll actually set my alarm to get up instead of sleeping in.",

They also offer waffles, pancakes and breakfast sandwich $4.99 specials until 11AM. On top of all that, service is exceptional and sanitation score was a 98. The dining room was packed from the time we arrived at 9:30 until we left an hour later.  I do recommend the sunny front dining area however, as the back room is a little drab.

They definitely didn't skimp on the berries which was great!  Eggs Benedict was good. Sauce was good and hash browns were a nice compliment. There were a ton of menu items to choose from.  Will definitely go back for more!",

Everything you order is perfectly delicious and consistently good. We've come here many times and will always be returning.",

They have a bakery counter where you can buy cookies, pastries, cake and breads as well as jams and dough. After looking at the menu, I decided to try the stuffed french toast and the skillet. The skillet was a fairly large portion so I didn't have much room for the french toast, but both of which were delicious. The potatoes were piping hot and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The french toast was stuffed and topped with a mixture of berries. The bread was soft and had a good consistency. Whenever I go to bunch, I often think about this skillet and wish it was an option. Will definitely come back if I return to Charlotte.",

Nicole sat us and she got the ball rolling on our amazing experience. She guided us through the menu, because EVERYTHING LOOKED SO AMAZING.   My mom and I finally decided: stuffed French toast, Popeyes Skillet, a side of the homemade grits and toast.  Now...we live for a skillet. And this did NOT disappoint. The spinach, baby portabellas, and eggs were cooked to perfect. Even the potato's had a perfectly crispy outside with a soft, delish inside. The toast was the same way- crispy crust, then perfectly done center.  The stuffed French toast is super decadent and perfect to share. Challah bread, with cream cheese and berries. SO. EPIC.  And all I'll say is...get the grits. Homemade and like the rest of their food...not over salted.  If you're near the area, the food, hospitality, and prices can't be beat.",

It's all home made btw! Yummy!!! There were these Texas Pete's peppers on the table that were a great addition to the dish!  Hubby had the stuffed French toast at my request. It was so delicious!

I had the Popeye Skillet with my eggs scrambled ($7.75). The scramble was mixed with sauteed spinach, sliced mushrooms, and melted jack cheese and sat on a huge mound of hash browns, far more hash browns than I could consume. Funny thing is, the menu listed \"potatoes\" instead of hash browns, so I was under the impression that it would come with home fries and almost ordered a side of hash browns (good thing I didn't!). My meal was hearty and delicious! It came with a soft, warm biscuit (or toast or english muffin) and whipped butter that easily melts and tastes like popcorn butter. My boyfriend had the Big Daddy Skillet ($9.50). His was significantly larger in size in comparison to mine, and mine was already a mountain! His order was a scramble with bacon, country sausage, Virginia ham, and cheddar cheese, also served on top of tons of hash browns. He also ordered a short stack of Basic Pancakes (2 pancakes for $3.95). These pancakes were also no joke in size! Our waiter was very attentive and well-mannered. He did, however, bring us 2 coffees (which tasted great) when we only wanted 1 cup. If you come here, make sure you come starving! You'll get both quantity AND quality!",

It was hideous looking and terrible tasting.  Wow- bad.  My pile of hash browns were dry and tasteless.  The \"toast\" was actually a slice of rigid bread, toasted with no butter; I had to apply that myself.    This is the 2nd time I've tried this place and neither visit felt like a value for my money.

They desperately needed more bussers - there were a bunch of tables that just needed to be cleared off to alleviate the waiting parties. Also, we saw them seat 1 person (\"party of 1\") at a 4-person table... which helps explain the wait I guess. After we were finally seated, we gave the waiter our drink orders, and waited, and waited, and after almost 10 minutes (of watching him run around and do everything from serve food, to take orders, to even bussing a table) we finally caught his eye to ask about our drinks. He apologized and said he'd forgotten, and brought them out to us a minute later. When the food finally arrived, it was...underwhelming. Despite my \"special\" skillet dish having chorizo, onion, and peppers among other normally bold flavors, it was incredibly bland and overpowered by the hashbrowns. Another person in our group got the breakfast burrito, and he said it was actually pretty good and filling but the hash browns it came with were not very good. The other person did a customized omelete (with many of the same fillings as mine), and he described it as fine, but not something he would order again either. While there were many appealing things on the menu, our experience did not make it seem it would be worth the ordeal.",

We figured that my order old take a little longer because mostly everyone there was ordering breakfast items. When our meals came out, his eggs were done perfectly.

No Pickle they ran out. As my granddaughter had a skillet loaded with hash browns.   Getting the chicken orzo soup to go for the wife.   No napkins  other than the ones wrapping the silverware.  Today I am not really pleased with everything.    Be a while before I return.   Update better service and food. Waitress great owner great came along way.

This is a classic diner the food is amazing the bread and cookies are all homemade on site and worth a trip from Raleigh to bring some home. The burger was probably one of the five best burgers I've ever had.  You can tell that the people who own this place really care about making good food and making their customers happy. I bought a coffee mug just so I can think about it when I'm sipping my coffee back here in Raleigh with no restaurant whatsoever like this.",

The bakery inside is better than 95% of stand-alone bakeries and is cheap, too!  The people there are so sweet! They have a live on the Sunday mornings (you can't give them a bad review for that - it means the place is worth trying!

We got subpar service at the bar. I had to flag someone down to refill my coffee and she rolled her eyes at me even though I apologized 3 times. The food took a little longer than I thought it would but it wasn't an unreasonable amount of time. The other waitresses coming through the bar area were very nice. I didn't like looking at their messy drink station but oh well. The food was DELICIOUS. They give you a lot of food for sure. My florentine eggs Benedict was so good. I loved the mushrooms at the bottom. The hollandaise sauce wasn't the best but the rest of it made up for it. We got two meals and a coffee and spent around $20. I'm sure if we sat somewhere else I would have been more happy with the service, but we were too hungry to wait.",

The salads are full of greens and an assortment of vegetables. The service is friendly, quick and spot on always. They never seem frazzled even though they're almost always busy.

We were seated in the side room which didn't have the vibe the rest of the diner had. It had old chairs and an ugly brown wall.   We ordered food immediately after being seated. I got a burger, my mom a salad, and my dad breakfast. Food came out fairly quickly, and here's where it all fell apart for me. My burger was downright mediocre. The cheese tasted (and looked) so processed and it killed the whole burger. The patty was nothing special. The fries were average. Mom and dad reported liking theirs, so maybe I just picked a bad item on the menu (although a diner should not mess burgers up).  Service was good. The waitresses called everybody honey just like you'd expect in the South. Nothing else was notable about lunch. I would give this place 2 stars, but I'll add the third for 2/3 of our meals being good.",

My husband got the garden omelet and said it was delicious. One of the better omelets he has had. The grits were good. Cooked nicely . The hash browns were kind of bland but add a bit of salt and you are good to go. It was a bit expensive. For both of us to eat breakfast it was $23 which is expensive for breakfast.

The patrons looked confused & she came back & picked up the plates. Made a circle round through the kitchen & then to my table. When I told her, she suddenly couldn't speak good English. We told lady when we pd she said that I was seeing things & My order came from the kitchen. She said the waitresses wouldn't do that. Never confronted the waitresses - just told me I was wrong.    Breakfast is hot & fresh. Pancakes are a little bland. They have ham & cheese club at lunchtime - YUM!!  We always share - its huge. Just know service is going to be mediocre at best.",

We were unaware it was cold until AFTER my boyfriend drenched the cakes in the syrup.    His omelette had waaaayyyy too much raw green pepper in it ; so much so he was immediately sick after.  My biscuits were light and fluffy and the sausage gravy was peppery, and not overly so.  Definitely would recommend the food but go to the Waxhaw  location.  Maybe the service is better.

    "text": "I can't rave enough about Stacks. It's a family owned diner with breakfast and lunch. It's usually pretty busy, but I've never had an unreasonable wait time. I first moved to Charlotte in August and my mom and I had breakfast before she headed back home from helping me settle in. We had coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, pancakes and the eggs Benedict. We were full and satisfied!  Now when anyone comes to visit me from out of town, I make sure to squeeze in a breakfast at Stacks. I have since ordered the traditional breakfast meal (super cheap), the low fat wrap, and the big daddy skillet- ALL DELISH. You've got to give it a try.",

    "text": "We finally checked out Stacks this weekend for a late breakfast. They were on a pretty long wait (45 minutes I believe) but they said the bar was first come, first served. We didn't score a seat up there, so we waited quite a while. The hostess brought around pound cake and offered to get us drinks while we were waiting; I thought that was a nice extra.   The inside is really nice and bright - we went to one of the previous restaurants here  years ago and it is totally different inside. They even had some nice Charlotte artwork!  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive - told us about how great everything on the menu was and how all the breads and most of the sweets are made in house (a couple items are brought in from Carnegie Deli in NY!).   Both of our meals were delicious and GIANT! We tried one of the skillets and an omelette (or is it omelet?) - seriously, they were both huge. I couldn't even finish mine!   Overall, this is a great spot to get breakfast and potentially lunch! Just don't go in starving, the place is very popular and you will most likely have to wait.",

    "text": "About a year back, I happened to drive through Waxhaw stopped for breakfast at the original Stacks Kitchen.  Now here was a reason to move to Waxhaw: a good menu, breakfast all day, fair prices, and a bakery case!  I was hooked and from that point on, if I was in Waxhaw around breakfast or lunch, Stacks is where I'd grab a meal.    So when I drove down Monroe Road and saw their coming soon banner, I was pretty excited.  Matthews doesn't have a good diner.  You might say what about have cracker-barrel and IHOP but eat a breakfast at Stacks and you'll never go back to those chains.    The inside is a mix of booths, tables, and even a bar to eat at.  The bar is first-come basis and with the exception of peak times on the weekend, there's always a spot available.  Service is great but like any great cult-eatery, they get busy so things do slow down.  I'd rather have slower service and good food than the trash on a plate found at the chains.  The food is incredible.  The baked goods and desserts are made in-house as well as their fresh-squeezed juicer.  They are fantastic and many of the breakfast meals come with their bread as toast.  Breakfast is my favorite whether its a large fluffy omelets or the waffle piled high with fruit.  Plus it's served all day...(which ends at 3pm for them).  The sandwiches (BLT, Turkey and Ham, etc) are stacked high like they're challenging you to take it all in one big food-coma inducing bite.  Make sure you save room for dessert as you're forced to stroll by their display case filled with cakes, cheesecakes, cookies, and canoli's - which is cruel and unusual punishment if you're stuffed up to your eyeballs.  That's ok - get it and take it home.",

Now the food, I ordered the chocolate waffle with biscuits and gravy. The waffle was really good fluffy not overcooked.  Sausage gravy and biscuits were my favorite, delicious. Definitely have to get them.  My boyfriend ordered the stacks Lumberjack with French toast with sausage patty. The sausage patty really yummy and I don't like sausage.

This place is always super clean the the staff - although running around, are super super nice.  I love the banter between the staff and the regulars.  They will always find time for you even though the place is slammed.  Props to a place that does fresh squeezed orange juice.  It is done by a machine, but you can watch the process up-close-and-personal since the juicer is displayed as soon as you walk in.  Along with a great display case of desserts and treats.",

Their food is reasonably priced and delicious.  They have a yogurt crunch bowl with fresh fruit, granola, honey, and greek yogurt. It is soooo good! They also have some great breakfast specials for under 6 dollars that come with a drink and either sausage or bacon.   My only complaint is the booths.  So uncomfortable, especially if someone is sitting in the booth behind you.  The backs must be loose or something because every time the person behind you moves you get knocked forward. They really should fix the seating.",
