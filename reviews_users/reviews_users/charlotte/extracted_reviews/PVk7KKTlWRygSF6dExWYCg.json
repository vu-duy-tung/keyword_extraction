Cute, signature eclectic decor with French flair.    I had the seasonal caramel apple petit gateaux....so nice to look at and nice to eat!  Can't go without an Amelie's latte.  I don't know how they do it but they have the best lattes I have ever had. It's like rediscovering coffee all over again.",

However, upon getting in line I was greeted unpleasantly by the woman behind the glass case saying \"listen up because I'm not saying these macaron flavors again.\" After only catching Half of the macaron flavors, I pointed to a flavor asking to purchase it. Her response was \"you're going to have to name the flavor I cant tell what you're pointing to\". I feel that going to a restaurant is not only about the food, but about the experience. And customers should not be made to feel as though they are burden. I will not be returning to this locations.",

After dinner yesterday we went to the Park Road location. Their dessert case isn't as robust as others but that didn't bother me because whatever I taste I care about the quality. We ordered two macaroons, a petite four, and slice of cake. The cake was good, the macaroons were okay, but my hazelnut petite four truly tasted like it had freezer burn (kind of like if cardboard had a taste). To me, if I pay $2.15 for a dessert it should be worth it's wait because baking is such a unique skill.  The atmosphere was fine, it's an open floor plan and a bit noisey but you can comfortably have a conversation. I wouldn't be able to study at this location though or read a book.",

    "text": "So, I'm on the hunt for an eclair made the way my favorite bakery back in San Diego made them: a long, wide generous size filled with a sweet, light vanilla pastry cream (as in not pudding-heavy and not whipped cream-light) with a rich, glossy decadent chocolate glaze. It definitely took more than four bites to eat. While I do like the traditional thin French ones, I find I need more than one to satisfy me and they often have a high pastry shell to cream ratio. So, when I was considering relocating to Charlotte, I was excited to hear that a popular place was a French bakery called Amelie's. I eagerly tried their eclair and was sad it wasn't like my old favorite. But that's not to say it isn't good. It's just different.  I tried both their vanilla and chocolate version. While good, I found their filling dense and heavier than I would have liked. I didn't give up on them though. Their vanilla cream puff is closer to what I was hoping for. The glaze is rich, soft and glossy and balances the pastry shell and vanilla cream filling nicely. I do find the filling a tad too light than I would like, but it's pretty good. There's no suffering involved eating 2-3 to equal my old favorite eclair size. I'm still on the hunt, so read my other reviews to see if I've found the \"one.\"  I've also had their salted caramel brownie. It's a moist fudge-like brownie as opposed to a cakey brownie. Very tasty and yummy with a cup of their cafe au lait. Their twice-baked croissant was delicious. They were serving a chocolate hazelnut version when I ordered. It made a delicious snack along my drive to Arlington, VA that day.  While they didn't match my favorite eclair style, they're a delicious and solid bakery option and still deserve 5 stars.",

I tried their mini cake bouchee which was good except for the chocolate one that tasted like dirt+sugar, but no offense that's just cause I hate chocolate. My bad-I guess I was hoping that place would change that but oh well..!  The staff it feels wanted to be nice, I mean the effort was there but wasn't fooling anyone.  -So the third time I went, the mixed berry tart was good! But the macaroons I had to throw away except the cotton candy one.. That time the staff seemed to me that they just didnt want to be there..  It's unfortunate to see a place with such great potential can be sooo careless about their guests' satisfaction. For a bakery to be selling \"sweets\", well the staff is just bitter! Or maybe it's my fault for having greater expectations... and they shld start warming up these quiches to a higher degree btw!!!",

Most times have been a jump in and jump out to grab sweets to go, but the most recent was with my wife and we ended up grabbing a glass of wine in addition of the treats to go. This location has a ton of seating and the decorations certainly can keep you entertained for a while. We also have had great service here. A neat example is where my wife wanted a gluten free caramel salted brownie and the server asked if she needed to grab new gloves to prevent cross contamination. Talk about attention to detail! They are also always on point when I ask them to do a full run down of all of the macaroon flavors. The net takeaway is don't pass on Amelies if you are looking for a great dessert!",

I tried several different things at several different visits, and nothing was phenomenal. The macaroons were especially a disappointment as the  shell was very grainy and honestly the whole thing tasted somewhat stale. I have also tried the eclair, which also tasted a little dry. It's a cute atmosphere to do work in or chat with friends, but in my opinion, there are much better desserts.",

Croissant was burnt/overcooked and crumbled. No condiments on the blt. The soup was mediocre and I ate it since I was starving. The ice tea cups are tiny and no real good way to get refills, especially when the line is long. Desserts are okay, nothing special.  The interior is smaller than other spaces they have, but it's clean and comfortable seating. I also like the coffee bar type seating they have on the upper level so if you come alone you don't feel like you are taking up the whole table. There also not a spectate ordering line for food/coffee and dessert so the line readily backed up during lunch. I really want to like Amelie's again, but quality just plummeted since 2013.

Also, I was happy to learn that it is only about 2 miles from my son's home.  The interior is done very nicely, but I think The Davidson location had more of an older, eclectic decor.   Although, it was very busy, the line moved quickly.  The staff was very friendly in spite of so many people coming in after church or stopping in for brunch.  We got our pastries and we're lucky enough to find an empty table inside.  There is a nice small patio  with seating, too.   I choose a mixed berry fruit tart and hot chocolate for my beverage.  There was a bit of a wait for the beverages and coffees.  The staff did an awesome job keeping up with so many orders.  Everything I had was very good.  The sandwiches and salads of other customers looked delicious.    I have no hesitation on returning here.  Great place.",

These places are all pretty equal in terms of service, quality of food, and witnessing way too many people on laptops at odd hours of the day (do you guys not pay for internet at home?). They have an interesting spread with some items being notably delicious (I.e. the salted caramel brownie and their muffins).   Prices are pretty steep for some things. I walked out $15 poorer with a brownie, a muffin, and cup of black coffee. Maybe some things are worth going often for, but I have yet to discover those. 3/5 as I have yet to have anything that's just mind blowing and the service is fair.",

I am a True fan of Amelie's and the eccentric decorations delighted me. They have a macaron chandelier!  One of 42 chandeliers hanging there in the restaurant.  And I love the chai drinks with almond milk.  They face the back side of Park Rd shopping center by the garden store from Blackhawk and across from Midwood. There's plenty of parking in the back lot.  The entrance is down the stairs like a basement but it's like a fun East Village vibe. The patio looks cozy when it's cool in the fall.

    "text": "We've always gone to the original Amelie's in NoDa, but it's always a \"special trip,\" as we don't live near there.  So when they started to branch out to other locations around Charlotte, we were able to make a few other unplanned visits when out and about.  We've tried the one near Pineville and the one in Uptown.  Both were MEH.  It didn't seem like they cared or tried as hard as the NoDa location and employees.  And neither seemed to have a good selection of items, no matter what time of day it was. So when the Park Road Shopping Center one opened up, we were a little hesitant.  This is the closest one to us yet, though, so we went.  I'm happy to report that we've been twice so far now!    They had a good selection of items (even at night, which is when we usually go for dessert).  We picked up two chocolate croissants to bring home to enjoy while watching a movie.  However, the macarons (not to be confused with a macaroon) looked tempting and looked small enough to enjoy there quickly before heading home with the croissants.  Surprisingly, it was my first time ever having a French macaron.  There were so many flavors to choose from.  Unfortunately, they're not labeled, though, so I have to make the employee give me the run down on the flavors each and every time.  It must get old for them, but hey -- slap some labels on them.  I chose the raspberry one.  After that first bite, I realized I'm never going back to croissants.  This was now and will forever be my Amelie's dessert of choice.  It was just so amazing.  It looks like, but doesn't taste like a whoopie pie.  It's got a unique texture -- a little crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside.  It was pure heaven.  I took several small bites to make it last.    The next time we went, I skipped the croissant and just went straight for the macarons.  This time, I ordered two -- a raspberry one again and a key lime one.  Again: freaking amazing.  I can't wait to try more and more.  And kudos to this location for being worthy of the original Amelie's name.",

In our last visit the puff pastry in a Napoleon wasn't flaky (more soggy than anything else - which in my mind meant it was at least a day old), a pair of different tea cakes were greasy (leaving a lot of buttery residue on the plate) and macaroons we got to go were tasteless and had an incorrect texture (you could feel clumped sugar).  In my opinion, compared to authentic French pastries, Amelie's pastries typically fall well short of the mark.  On the flip side, the coffee is usually very good.",

But it's not so much so that I don't occasionally pop in on break from work. Going into the Park Rd location, I figured I'd have a similar experience at the least: maybe the service would lack but the food and coffee were bound to be good.  Luckily, I was right on the latter and wrong in the former. The ladies working the front line were super friendly and helpful. My friend and I became paralyzed with indecision at all the choices. The girls working there made recommendations, joked with us, and generally made me feel welcome. They even pointed out my friend would get a free eclair for his birthday, something I had no idea Amelie's did.   Sadly, this location is not at all conveniently located to me, especially with the Uptown and NoDa locations. But I occasionally find myself this way and I'm glad to have this as an option for a coffee or afternoon sweet treat.",

Yellow and Blue Herbal Tea \"The Au Lait\" style: this one I will grab when it's late night and I'm going straight to bed after wards. It's a mixture of chamomile, lavender and other ingredients and the milk and honey tops it off so well. (It's a weird combo but I love it!)

I'm sitting there waiting for the vanilla to kick in but nothing, very flat. The eclair had a good chocolate topping and the filling did have a good vanilla flavor but the crust was bland.  We didn't ha e anything else to go by and we did see quite a few people eating there so maybe we just had a few deserts that weren't as good this time.

It's like you really stepped into a cafe in France somewhere.  Again, I'm a huge fan.

    "text": "Bonjour!!  In my book, the ultimate Charlotte weekend would be to take a long walk through the Sugar Creek Greenway, watch a Panthers Home Game, stroll through one of the many art museums, and enjoy a divine snack at Amelie's. Fortunately with the growing number of locations, the latter is becoming more and more convenient!  Most of you will know of the Park Road Shopping Center but may be surprised to find that the backlot behind the main strip is really starting to develop. Right across from Rocksalt is Amelie's newest location. I think the concept I like most about the design for any of their bakeries is that you walk in and their thoughtful decor gives the illusion that they've been there forever. Tables made from reclaimed wood complement the ornate chandeliers throughout. All of the artwork fits the old-world French Bakery theme that really immerses you into a transfixion where time seems to slow down, you can really enjoy whatever you're nibbling on.  So speaking on nibbling, as a near decade-long patron of the 'original' Amelie's in NoDa,  I hadn't ordered the Napoleon until a couple of days ago. It is the ultimate pastry showstopper that they serve in the most traditional fashion of alternating layers of puff pastry and creme, topped with an elegant icing pattern. It's baffling to be such a work of art, yet able to be ordered any time you want. Such an incredibly technical pastry at the drop of a hat is reason enough to stop by. Bravo Amelie's, you've dazzled me dozens of times in the past but this one 'takes the cake!'  If you're looking for more savory refreshments then you're in luck. I think the prominent case of sweets makes the sandwich menu take a bit of a back seat, but you should definitely give it a go. Most of their sandwiches are served on either a croissant or a baguette, but they will gladly swap one out for the other. I'm always debating between the Roast Beef & Manchego  Croissant or the Chicken Salad Croissant. You won't be disappointed by either but don't take my word for it! Be sure to check the menu for seasonal additions and especially the rotating soups that are always just marvelous; perfectly seasoned and wholesome, what more could you ask for?  One day I'm hoping for one of those 'work from home' jobs where I can work on my laptop, sip on Russian Tea, and munch on morsel after morsel at the coffee bar here. Until then, the visits to Amelie's are the feature of my mornings.  Au revoir!",

Their breakfast sandwiches are big portions and customizable. I don't think I've had the same combo twice. Their Turkey and Brie is delicious and always leaves me wanting a second one because it's so good. One of my favorite sandwiches in the city. I do wish they had some more comfortable sitting locations to be able to sit and read. It seems like their other locations do. A line just for a cup of coffee could move things along on a Saturday morning. But then, how could they entice you with contents they show of fin their case?",

I got the chicken salad on a croissant, and while I thought it was a high quality sandwich, I was bummed that the chicken salad contained raw onion. I realize that raw onion is not an unusual ingredient in a chicken salad, but raw onion is kind of a controversial ingredient, right? It should have been listed as an ingredient.  I mean, people who don't like raw onion REALLYYYYY don't like it. I am one of those people. I just don't want to eat anything with raw onion because I don't like the flavor and find it very overpowering.  All of the other chicken salad ingredients were listed on the menu board, but not the onion. Whatever. My husband ate it, lol.  I'll maybe stick with the egg sandwich in the future. Like all of the Amelie's locations, Park Rd is super cute and the staff is very friendly.  There are several tables outdoors, but the layout is a bit awkward, and there's not a lot of shade.  Still a great place to eat/hang out.",

I've gotten to know Bill Lamb, one of the owners, and have visited Cafe des Deux Moulin's, where the film Amelie was filmed in Paris.  So, this new place was a little challenging to accept when she first opened.    She reminds of the NoDa original but now she's all grown up.  The Myers Park location is in the Back Lot of Park Road Shopping Center.  Lexus, Mercedes, and Land Rover grace the lot instead of working vans, VW's, and transients.  The place teams with kids and dogs on the weekends.  It is very nice, but somehow not the same.  It was like when I fell in love with this cute girl in high school who would skip school with me, skied with me in Vermont, and wore halter tops and very short cut-offs in the summer.  Now, she returns after graduating from college with her master's degree.  She's the same girl underneath, but no longer a child: refined, elegant, and confident--like a bottle of wine from Bordeaux.  And she's here to stay, serving rich pastries, deep coffee, and flavorful soups and sandwiches--just like NoDa--but with her delicate touch of maturity.    So, why only 4 stars?  I'm still in love with my high school sweetheart--she's a 5 in my book!  Bon appetit, Amelie!",

They sound delicious, and have somewhat of a disappointment. I had a pumpkin spice cream puff, which lacked pumpkin flavor.

I tried the salted caramel brownie as well, which was delicious, but very sweet. The chocolate croissant looked good on the outside but was sadly barely filled with chocolate on the inside. Tragic.",

This place is enormous, and it was packed mid-day mid-week.  There was even a video blogger doing some filming inside while I was there.  The patrons were young and old, including what appeared to be a group of about 12 having a business meeting in one area.  The vibe is cool, chic French, with lots of eclectic seating and decor.  The music is fitting but not obtrusive.  The pastry case is huge, and the simple chocolate croissant and latte I had were perfect.  My only wish is that they had more outdoor seating, and that is was shaded.  On a sunny day, this is the only thing they don't offer much of.  But, the inside...c'est vraiment magnifique!",

The location is behind the shopping center (as an FYI) since the GPS kept taking me to the bakery in the front. There's plenty of parking and this location has lots of seating indoors and outdoors.   The decor is just as eclectic as the other location and every little detail makes this a magical experience. There are plenty of sweets to choose from and, honestly, I have yet to try anything that I don't like. Of course, I'm more on the fruitier side but I'm sure the chocolatey delicacies are amazing as well.   Their turkey & brie sandwich is definitely my favorite since it has a homemade seasonal jam. The lemonade is also delicious. I really like that this location has a bar and you can also enjoy drinks there. There's a little bit for everyone to enjoy with family and friends!

Ohhhh the convenience of being able to walk to everything.    Amelie's is located in the back lot of the shopping center - you have to walk behind Michaels past rock salt and it will be on the left.  There is a cute little patio out back and you walk down the stairs from the patio to get to the entrance.  Ordered a small tart, the salted caramel brownie (if you've never been here, please just get this is mine blowing), and a macaroon.  We checked out and then ordered two glasses of wine at the bar and sat on the patio.  This was a nice night cap to my evening!",

Believe me, I've tried a bunch of places and have concluded that Bojangles' is the clear winner.  Sad.  And then Amelie's showed up in the back lot of Park Road Shopping Center.  My first thought was \"Ok let's give this place a shot.\"  I walked in and saw a typical Amelie's decor...mismatched furniture, blue walls comfortable seating.  This location was a bit different, with the wide open space and a nice looking bar next to the coffee machines.  Perfect spot to sit if you're just hanging out by yourself.  The staff is always walking around cleaning and checking in on people, so it's nice to see a place where the employees care.  I saw a breakfast sandwich on the menu...great, we're on the right track!  The menu is simple...start with an egg, pick a bread, choose a protein and select a cheese.  I'm a big ham/egg/cheese sandwich on a croissant sandwich kind of girl, so that's what I got.  Croissant was a little greasy, but the sandwich was great!  Real egg that was freshly cooked with a good portion of warm ham.  YUM!!!  I'm so happy I found my new go-to, to-go breakfast sandwich place.  Not only do I have another great dessert place to pick up some sweets for friends, but I have a place to treat myself on a weekend morning!",

We stopped in around 9am on opening Saturday to enjoy some breakfast and experienced a fast-moving line and plenty of smiles.   You know the drill: salted caramel brownies, mouth-watering flaky croissants, and traditional cafe drinks. This visit I enjoyed a raspberry streusel muffin and we got back in line to grab three more croissants to save us a trip for the next morning.   The funky decor permeates throughout three different seating areas, including a large main floor, some elevated seating on the right when you walk in, and a large patio that will certainly get more use once the dog days of summer depart.   I'm glad I tried the lavender + honey soda, as it was a refreshing way to start the day. This Charlotte staple is now more easily accessible for the Myers Park crowd and certainly will stay busy, so I wonder how much the nearby Caribou Coffee will take a hit in business? With Dot Dot Dot speakeasy-style bar and Midwood Smokehouse BBQ, you could spend a whole day eating and drinking around the backlot of Park Road Shopping Center!",

Settled in for my favorite menu items : macaroons and a hot tea. Lots of space and lots of outlets to charge devices. Great for meet-ups, homework, people watching....maybe a little loud for homework on the weekends though. I always try to bring family here when they come to Charlotte, because the food is always good, and the location is always unique. It's French, but not in an intimidating way. There's something for everyone here.",

Its spacious open late till midnight with free wifi good coffee shop. Coming to the food this definitely overrated not what you expect. I tried the creme brulee and spinach & asiago quiche. Creme brulee had no flavor big no and it had black dots in between I was quite doubtful about it and I asked the staff they said that it was vanilla bean. Nah !!! big no to the creme brulee. Spinach & asiago quiche which was served after 15 minutes I understand that no one can make quiche right then but if they warm up well and serve it would be appreciated. If I take a bite it had too hot warm and cold temperatures at once I really couldn't take this worst thing anymore we just threw it and left that place. I would never suggest this place for their bakery items.",

    "text": "Great Amelie's location. Since it was on the way back home, we decided to \"skip the line\" that is always present at the original location in NoDa and head over this way. It's crammed into the back of a shopping center on Park that has just about everything in it you could ever need or want.  But Amelie's is the focus here. They've got almost everything you can get at the main location and they're probably about the same size inside. They get sufficiently packed here too. I joked with my girlfriend that when a new Amelie's opens the local thrift stores must run out of stock - because they furnish the places with only mix-matched furniture and random paintings. They've got the sandwiches menu, the tea and coffee, the cakes, macarons, tarts, salted caramel brownies, petit fours, etc. etc. On this visit I even saw entire macaron cakes.  Lots of seating. It was a rainy day but there's seating outside for when it's not. And the neighborhood is not as sketchy as NoDa - that's certainly a win in my opinion. Closer to home too. The quality isn't even with all Amelie's locations though. Maybe it's a side effect of being so popular that quality is starting to fall. That's the only reason I can't afford them 5 stars because I otherwise love me some Amelie's.",

    "text": "As much as I actually love Amelie's, I must say it almost never fails to disappoint.   Today we got a big bowl of the soup du jour, called chicken pesto.  No chicken was in the bowl, but the nice folks at the counter dished up a fresh one so that fixed it.  Perhaps they should let the rest of their staff know how to stir the soup before serving.   The sandwiches are also disappointing.  The roast beef had two very thin slices of beef and a dab of manchego, the croissant overtoasted but cold.  The lovely turkey and Brie is also tres petit.  I don't expect American-sized portions but if they downsize their portions they should downsize their prices accordingly.   My side salad had challengingly large chunks of unpeeled regular cucumber.  Even the rural French would scoff at this overly clumsy attempt at country cuisine.    We did not get any cake this time but I have to say I no longer get any cake at Amelie's.  There is little cake in their cake; it is mostly unappetizingly stiff, mostly flavorless butter cream.  The cake that is there must be made from unpleasantly flavorless foam, not a proper sponge.  Today's peche tatin had better delicate flavor, but the bottom of the short crust was too hard to cut with a fork without leaving red marks on my hand.   The cafe glace was a bit too bitter.  They should choose a different brewing method for their iced coffee.   Perhaps the management would do well to have their bakers and chefs taste and critique their work thoroughly every day before serving it to the public.  And ship in some real French pastries, at least the ones that the local staff haven't yet mastered, for them to taste.  I hope Amelie's won't rest on their laurels and will work to improve their offerings.",

    "text": "This was the first breakfast place I visited when I came to visit my folks in Charlotte for the first time. My mom had seen them in a Charlotte magazine and suggested we all check it out because they made French macaron.   The location was very quiet when I came in - I had come off a red eye flight from LAX and we went around the time it opened, which is why there weren't many people there. The gals behind the counter were friendly and prompt with taking the orders for the breakfast sandwiches (the first time I ordered one, the gal offered to have double bacon put on mine because I didn't want to add any greens to the sandwich).   Food came out pretty quickly - I'd say it took 7 minutes tops the first time I came. (They've tried to ensure that food comes out in a timely manner whenever I've gone.) I like how crisp their bread is for their sandwiches and the eggs are never brown or rubbery. (I've had that struggle with places where egg sandwiches usually come with slightly browned eggs or eggs that have a rubbery texture to them.)  The pastries behind the displays are beautiful and their macarons are great.   The atmosphere is pleasant and a bit quirky - you can easily sit and enjoy your food and a cup of something hot to drink while soaking up the decor. You get French cafe vibes with some punny humor like the Bach joke by the door, the height ruler showing the heights of famous people, etc.   Prices are fair on the items and I always enjoy coming back here for breakfast and some macaron to go.",

I always appreciate their recommendations. Overall this cafe is clean and tidy.   There's a lot to choose from if you're interested in pastry and desserts, soups, salads and more. I'm truly obsessed with the macarons, the flavors change each season. I had the pleasure of trying the NEW Lavender Lemon Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich! The Lemon sorbet was zesty and refreshing. I would recommend sharing this dessert with a friend(it's huge). Naturally, I couldn't leave without purchasing a few other Macarons, I tried three new flavors (Passionfruit, Key lime, and blackberry basil). FYI the blackberry basil is DELISH!",

Basking in the glow of MLB's smile I missed another photo op... Really like the \"Provence Trailer Park\" decorating scheme: furniture collage, odd accents, bright lighting, and some of the finest bad art pieces I've seen this side of Arkansas. Someone went to a great deal of trouble to get it set up like this so spend a few minutes to soak in it and get over yourself.

Some catching up with old friends, others working on their computers.   We were promptly assisted at the counter by the kind young lady.  She answered our questions on the pastry options and flavors.  Plenty of staff on duty to ensure a speedy checkout.  Everyone in our group was super satisfied with our selections.

I have no idea why the lady who handed me my sandwich said they are swamped when there are literally a dozen people in the cafe. Ridiculous",

Starting off the decor and way the place is designed is beyond interesting and beautiful. It is also way larger than one would expect for a bakery/cafe combo, it may be one of the largest I've ever been in.   The menu was very easy to read and almost everything sounded great. I will admit that most of my time was spent drooling while looking through the display for desserts and macaroons. I ended up going with a Strawberry Lemonade Macaroon and then one of their strawberry and lemon based drinks (are you starting to see a theme here, it's literally my favorite flavor of most things). Let me tell you...Amelie's did not disappoint, oh my goodness I am now in a bad mood because I don't have one of these in my hometown.",

The pastries are dry and overly sweet, specifically the Carmel brownie. The quality of the macaroons reflect grocery store mass produced, and sadly, they are not melt in your mouth delectable. Why come so many times? It's closer than the downtown store and we keep thinking the quality will be that of the flagship store.   It's ok here..the baguettes are good, the coffee is good quality and we like a few other things. But it's just three star tasty",

    "text": "We had heard positive things about Amelie's from local friends, but aside from the positive experience of dealing with incredibly friendly staff, the atmosphere was too crazy, and the tarts that we had were simply \"okay.\"   The space is massive inside, ornately-decorated to a fault. I'm sure it's meant to be part of their gimmick, but it just added to the perceived chaos of the place. We were there at a lull, so without others sort of leading the way, I wasn't 100% sure of the ordering location or process. It was also pretty loud, despite it not being too full. Regardless, the staff were very friendly, answering any questions that I had, and the checkout process was pretty smooth. Since we had two ready-made items, I didn't have to wait, which was nice! There's a sizable outdoor patio, as well, which is where we went because we had our pup with us.  Sure, the atmosphere wasn't my style, but the main reason that I can only give 3 stars is simply the tarts being pretty average. They're not the worst tarts I've had, but lacked the richness in their crust that I'm used to at some of the other French bakeries that we frequent. The texture wasn't there, either. The crust was very soft and bland, and their filling was essentially the same. Perhaps they had been sitting for too long, but even if the texture was there, there just wasn't enough flavor.  Overall, I'll admit that this is purely a subjective rating. We had higher expectations, otherwise, I'd have graded on a friendly curve. Would I return and try some of their sandwiches or baked goods? Sure, but if I'm craving pastries, Amelie's isn't going to be the first spot that comes to mind, unfortunately.",

    "text": "So I've been meaning to check out this new location for a while now, but I usually end up going to either Uptown or the original NoDa location whenever I think of going to Amelies.  I'm glad I finally got around to checking out this location, it's just as unique when you put them all side-by-side.  Located behind Park Rd Shopping center, I always knew this \"back alley\" had so much potential and a bit of \"hidden mystery\" so adding an Amelies here makes so much sense.  The space is almost sunken into the basement of whatever resides on top of the structure in the front (bikesource maybe?)  You walk through the outdoor patio, which will be nice when the weather warms up, and descend down some stairs to the entrance.  You get immediately hit by all things Amelie between the signature blue stripped wall covering and all the chandeliers.  Make your way to the Pastry Case and the lovely staff will help make your selections and either box the up or present them on a plate for you to enjoy there.  If you want something more savory, order at the counter and you are given a number while your food is prepared.  The bar is located in the back left and your coffees and drinks are prepared there.  I noticed a ton of tables and two different levels- one loft-ish level and then a large open space in the middle.  Given that the space is in \"the basement\" it is very cozy... I'm not that y'all, but there are a lot of ducts and vents to avoid, but the space is wonderfully done.    Sad there isn't a window to watch bakers make treats like Uptown, but it captures the original NoDa  location fairly well.   The back of PRSC is full especially with the opening of Midwood's other location, but there is plenty of parking which makes this Amelies a great/convenient place to meet up.  On my first visit there was a large group of 20 ladies and their grandkids meeting up- they took up a lot of the front of the store, but there were plenty of other tables to accommodate everyone.",

    "text": "After two visits to Charlotte and Amelie, I figure its time to craft a review! This most recent visit, we counted on Amelie to kick our butts into gear with some caffeine and quiche before a long day of traveling on the road. Note to self: Charlotte has few options open on Sunday mornings. We opted for a breve latte, a seasonal chai/cranberry espresso drink and two slices of the quiche. The seasonal cranberry chai espresso drink was a little sweet for my taste but I enjoyed the chicken lorraine quiche.   The space is very Alice in Wonderland meets French tea party with whimsical lighting, wall decorations and charming mismatching tables and chairs. If you're looking to meet up with a large group, this spot is for you. It's fairly large on the coffee shop/bakery scale. Parking is very easy and I appreciated that they also had bike parking and ADA accessible entrance clearly marked. The staff was very friendly during our recent visit. My only hesitation in the fifth star is that we were the only ones there and it took a solid 15-20 minutes for our grab and go quiche to be heated up before hitting the road which seemed slow given that it was just us.",

The shop is below grade and has a lot of hard surfaces. It's quite noisy, I cannot understand how people use this place for studying. If you sit across someone you have to almost yell. I typically get my order to go, because it is so damn good.   I recommend: - Napoleon - Twice baked croissant - any tart (the minis are my fave) - Croque Monsieur - Almond croissant  anything is good....those were just my go-tos.  The location is at the back of the Park Rd shopping mall. So you won't actually see it from the main parking lot.",

    "text": "Some hits, some misses.  We ordered 2 cinnamon chocolate macaroons, 1 eclair, 1 salted caramel brownie, 1 chocolate and 1 Strawberry vanilla Petit gateau. Total came to about $24.  Cinnamon chocolate macaroons had good texture, nice chew, but tasted like what I imagine eating potpourri would be like.. the cinnamon was so powerful it caused a mild burning sensation in my mouth, also the pairing with the chocolate is an off combo, I'd advise not choosing that flavor. Wife loved the eclair, said the salted caramel brownie was strange yet ate the whole thing... The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchocolate.petit.gateau.is.good.af&s=6687dd7bec7ee106ee5c73f9884eb5cdb5a914d6a754b223d4304c280d1383c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chocolate.petit.gateau.i...</a>.. air-y, chocolate-y, moist, rich-but-not-too-rich little cake. Easily the star of the visit. Unfortunately it's brother from another mother, the vanilla strawberry, was kinda meh.. icing had a flat taste. Best described as tasting like butter with a pinch of sugar and vanilla hiding somewhere inside it. The cake was about an hour away from being extremely dried out and while the strawberry icing inside was good, it couldn't save the cakes shortcomings.  Would I make a second visit? I would be hesitant to return for anything except that chocolate Petit gateau.",

    "text": "In the course of meeting a friend for coffee, I had the opportunity to visit Amelie's not once, but twice within a week.  Being a caffeine addict, I was totally down for both experiences!  Finding Amelie's can be a bit of a challenge because the cafe is located BEHIND the Park Road Shopping Center.  So let me just take a moment here to caution you not to follow the signs pointing to the front.  I'm not sure why those signs exist but I will tell you that they are confusing and unhelpful to the caffeine-deprived.  So ignore them, drive to the back and you can't miss the place.  I was blown away when I walked in!  This place is huge with so many seating options:  tons small cafe tables with intentionally mismatched chairs, cushioned booths, and even longer tables for groups.  You will find an appealing place to sit, I promise!  There is even outdoor seating if that's the sort of environment you prefer, but it's July here so indoor seating was the better option for me.  The decor here is on pointe for a French bakery.  The beverage menu is extensive:  lots of hot and cold coffees and teas, Italian sodas, and Mimosas -- YES!  So many kinds of Mimosas.  I could come here just to day-drink and munch on French pastries, but for these two visits, I stuck to coffee and iced tea.  The coffee was rich with undertones of cherry.  The iced tea beverage I tried was a green tea/blueberry concoction that was absolutely perfect for a hot July day.   I also tried a couple of coconut macaroons which were fabulous.  I will definitely be going back to try out other pastries... and day-drink because 1) I'm up for the challenge and 2) Mimosas!",

We had dinner at the backlot so we decided to walk over for some dessert.   It's a pretty nice space. It's pretty big and very open. There's a patio outside, but there's no food or drink allowed out there which is interesting.   We got a few macarons (birthday cake, caramel apple, and smores), a pumpkin macaron ice cream sandwich, and a spiced pumpkin and cream cheese entrement. Everything was delicious, but the ice cream sandwich was my favorite!  If you've never been to Amelie's before, it's definitely a must try!",

First off creme brulee is my favorite dessert of all time so I was shocked to realize they would do Togo. They asked if I'd like it brulee'd which made me laugh because what do you call un brulee'd,  creme brulee?! lol. Anyway then they had a variety of macaroons. Instead of having the counter guy name them all, I felt bad, I said \"what are your most unique\"?! I'm also a fan of odd flavors. He named like 6 which I'm forgetting of now(that's how boring the flavors were) before he mentioned rose water/flower? Idk but I was intrigued. I was so excited To get these home. How cool that a dessert shop was open so late!!! Well I'm so let down. My brulee was burnt and too bitter to eat, and my beautifully flavored macaroon was stale and not at all crunchy. I tried to eat around the burnt sugar and just eat the custard... just as disappointing. No flavor and all gelatin. Worst \"creme brulee\" I've ever had. Crushed with disappointment, I think I'll stick with a McFlurry next time.",

This location has a lot of room, yet is made so quaint and comfy. There are many sections with couches, small and a couple bigger tables, a fireplace. The pastry selection is wonderful and SO yummy.

I have seen bible study, women meeting, and girls hanging out, People with dyed hair, no hair, and wings, pre-med Student studying and groups catching up. This is an inclusive space and more importantly a safe one. I am actually a fan of their pastries although my friends would beg to differ. They love the savory soups and sandwiches. I started my Amelie affection based on the tart (hazelnut was my fav) but have shifted to their palmers, macrons and recently sticky buns. They have an eclectic variety of options made fresh daily and with that being said it can be hit or miss on the available options. Be open-minded while going as the prices are not for the faint of heart. The decor is cute and Parisian inspired which is a cute homage. Now that they have branched out I have found that there are more locations in and around charlotte and can always sneak in for a quite bite, download, coffee or chat with friends. I highly suggest you give it a try. Don't be surprised if you being to plan your next vacay to Paris. Bonjour!",

It totally over powers the taste of the entire macaron. Taste more like jelly filled cookies or a jelly roll than a macaron. The iced sticky bun was disappointing as well as it was burnt around the edges. As of matter of fact, All of them in the display were burnt. I still decided to try it tearing off the burnt edges of the bun. They definitely shouldn't have served them. The bun taste ok but drier than what I'm used to having at NoDa's location. The salted caramel brownie was good & same taste/quality as the other location. Overall, It's worth the drive to NoDa instead of this location next time...",

The coffee is from an excellent Charlotte-area roaster who does it right.    I got a box of mixed macarons as a gift... they were quite tasty!  They have some service issues, but I'm betting that will settle out as they employees settle in to the new joint.  EDIT:  I've gone back several times and their service has smoothed out a bit now that they have had some time to smooth out the rough edges.  5-stars.  The Croissant breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites and the coffee is really something special (probably in my top 2-3 Charlotte cups).  The pecan tarts and anything with fresh fruit on top are stellar.",

While the main entrance has awnings and decorations, the one that has a ramp instead of stairs is hidden out of view on the other side of the building with a much smaller sign that only indicates that Amelie's is in that space, not that there is an entrance there. There is a total of one accessible parking space in that section of the lot, and it is all the way over by Rocksalt. Brownies or no brownies, I'm going to keep looking for a place where I'm a customer and not just a grudging legal requirement.",

One very polite guy taking orders and packing up treats in the appropriate size box. One cashier trying to work fast but was simple overwhelmed by the constant flow of people. One guy stocking the case with more tasty treats. Heard him say \"make sure you tell people these are still frozen\". Wait? What?  Seemed like an odd thing for me to hear but I am sure with the volume they do, making ahead isn't far from what probably happens. Not a huge deal just caught me off guard. The treats I got were great which were a salted caramel brownie and mini key lime tart. I really felt another person or two working would have made my visit 5 stars.",

Either way, the pastries, service and variety are all winners.",

It's called a Russian Tea. It is steamed orange juice with cinnamon clove simple syrup and topped with cinnamon. Though it's not really tea, it tastes wonderful and better than I imagined.",

    "text": "Well to some up the latest location the phrase \"soccer mom\" comes to mind.  All of the eclectic charm of the NODA Amelie's is gone and replaced with a franchised version.  The staff is ok, more of an order taker than of a locally owned shop.  The desserts are amazing as always so at least that hasn't changed.  The Key Lime tart is our new favorite!  I've been twice and will continue to go as I love their food, but the atmosphere of the NODA location cannot be duplicated and maybe they shouldn't have tried as it's a miss.",
