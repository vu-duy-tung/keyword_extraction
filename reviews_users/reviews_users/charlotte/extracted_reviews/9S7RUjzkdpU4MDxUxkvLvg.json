    "text": "FALSE AND MISLEADING ADVERTIZING!!  I came here one evening and asked about the $3 14 oz. drafts as advertised.  The sign says Crafts, Domestics and Imports.  When I tried to order the first 2 beers I asked for were not eligible of the offer.  Then I asked what beers were eligible and I was told only Bud Light.  In no way would I ever consider Bud Light as a \"craft\" beer and it is for sure not an import!  I was annoyed.  That is definitely False advertising.  I then ordered the BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza which was also running as a special for $5.  I was charged full price and had to ask her to adjust the check.  I think this is wrong and I would never trust any thing they say.  This is obviously an attempt to lure people in and not give them what was advertised or an attempt to run up my bill so I tip more.  Either way, I feel this is unethical and I would warn anyone coming in to turn around and go to Chili's next door or TMAC. Save yourself some aggravation, some money and most likely better food as mine as fairly bland.",

    "text": "This was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a TGI Fridays. It was a Saturday evening visit, and it was one of those days... First off, I've been to this Friday's before, and it was decent. This time, it went bad. Starting off, the atmosphere was awfully loud with a few drunks at the bar, @ 530?!? The food however started ok, and progressively got bad. We ordered two appetizers and our main courses. Apps were ok, not great, but our fried green beans were luke warm at best and our dip was ice cold. We got Ribs and Chicken, and the Ribs were tough and very meatless for the cost of the dish. The chicken was soggy, and tasteless. Our waiter, he was very attentive, but too attentive, coming back every 2-3 minutes asking if everything was ok. It seemed like he knew there was a bigger problem than we thought.. It was a disaster on date night, and very disappointing.",

Not only that but the waitress was very helpful in sharing some of her favorite dishes (i like doing this to see how much they know about the food they serve!). I got the 8oz stake which I wanted MORE of (it was soooo good) with a side of Stake Fries. The wife loved her shrimp & ribs combo plate (which I of course \"tasted\" as well) and it was very good. The shrimp had a tasteful seasoning to it that when they breaded it, it stayed juicy... The baby raved about the mash potatoes... She said it was \"hmmoowerasommmmm....\" lol. Oh and before I forget, their Jack Daniel sauce was interesting and would go back to get more... Thanks for looking!",

    "text": "Tonight was horrible! I've been here a few times with friends, but this was the worst experience I've had. We were seated immediately, however our server was not a good one. I believe his name is Chris... He took our drink order and didn't ask if we wanted any apps or wanted to put in any orders. Once we got it drinks, it took him a while to come back to take the order. He never came to check on us once we got our food or asked if anybody wanted to order another drink. Before he brought the checks I asked for 2 of the Tennessee whiskey cakes. He then brought the checks and didn't add the cakes in. My total was $19.52, so I paid with a $20 and we were all going to leave a tip collectivity. I was the only person that paid cash. When he returned to the table, he brung everyone else their cards back, kept my change and receipt, and didn't return with my cake. He said y'all have a good night. I then asked him where my cake was because at that point I wasn't worried about the change. He says \"oh, damn... I didn't put it in. You still want it?\" DUH! That was the purpose of me telling you I wanted it! He put the order in, brung the cakes, then says y'all have a good night. I'm thinking that because he had such horrible service, the cakes were free because he didn't bring a check. He watched us get up and leave out. Next thing i know...He chased us to the car to get me to pay for them. Never again!",

But, the restaurant was busy and I always hesitate to return food to the kitchen. I was also hungry and ate it anyhow. Six hours later I was sick on the floor of the bathroom, weak, cold chills, sweating profusely from every pore in my body and wondering if I should call 911 before I passed out. After several trips to the bathroom, I was able to sleep again, and was weak most of the day but the food poisoning had passed apparently. It was the only meal that I had the entire day that I visited the restaurant.  I went in the location the next afternoon to speak with manager to explain what happened. He was unapologetic, rude and a condescending. He patronizingly said, \"You can do whatever you want\" about situation, as if I needed his permission complain elsewhere. He refused to refund to my credit card for the meal which only would have helped slightly because I would rather have not endured the ordeal. The only thing that visibly got his attention was the phrase \"social media\". I would never return to a Fridays and I would advise others to do the same.",

I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered, ohhhh yea, this place is soooo loud. I'm not talking a little loud, I'm talking scream to place an order or ask your wife sitting next to you what the waiter said. Yep, that loud.  It took us about 15 minutes to get seated was what they had advised. The waiter was good and provided really good service (Once we could hear each other). It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party.  So I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time. Fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me, fool me three times.......",

Little or no working heat (or so it seems) on a cold day is another turnoff.   If you long for the Friday's experience of the 1980s, don't go to this one. The Friday's at Concord Mills Mall gets about three stars compared to this location.  At the same time, this chain is past its prime. With so many great restaurants in this area, the only reason someone would stop here is the expectation of name recognition.  Sorry, but this site may disappoint.",

Overweight single men on one side of the bar, groups of women in tight, revealing clothes on the other. Groups of very drunk patrons in booths. At the end of our meal I asked our waiter what was going on, and he confirmed the worst. He started his description with, \"Have you ever read Dante's Inferno?\" He said the other parts of the restaurant were okay, but that were were seated in was around the eighth level of hell. Great waiter, average food (hey, it's a Friday's, that's all we were expecting) but NOT a family place.",

I order one of the stacked burgers without onions he told me that i couldn't alter the burger so by this time I was really aggravated so i just said ok. My boyfriend ordered a burger also. The food came out in about 30 minutes, the burgers were ok, the fries were lukewarm. He didnt come back for another 13 or so minutes with the check. No refills or anything. We will definitely not be back at this location. A manager was not seen. I hope they start to improve on customer service soon.",

    "text": "I sincerly love Fridays, have for a really long time.  And since the one on Independence was taken from me a while ago I always frequent the one on Harris.  So that's where I found my self last night, I got there right before it got really crowded so I thought.  Any who we got seated pretty fast being that it was pretty crowded, our waitress was nice.  We ordered I food pretty fast, so there should have been no reason for us to get it after we had been there almost an hour.  I do understand that it was busy and I do also understand that people order food at the same time being that it's a restaurant that tends to happen.  So when I asked our waitress what the hold up was that was her response every one ordered at the same time.  So any way, we finally got our apps and waited for our food, finally got the food by now I was ready to go irratated by the atmosphere and the fact we got our food pretty late.  The manager made his way to my table and apologized for the slowness and gave us dessert for free which I thought was nice.  Our waitress only refilled our drinks once which I thought was a no no.  But me being me amazingly I didn't complain I just let it be (amazing I know....lol)  So I got some food to go, I didn't look at just for some reason trust that it was correct.  Got home looked at it, and it was missing a key ingredient.  I ordered a grilled chicken balsamic glazed cobb salad, and well I was missing the chicken can you believe that?  So being that it's a good 20 minutes away from me I didn't make the trip back to complain I just called instead.  I talked to the same manager I'm sure that fixed the first problem and he said sorry and is supposed to send me a gift certificate.  Apparently this happens more often than not because he didn't find it strange at all.  Moral is and I know that I don't need to tell you this but always check your food.  I normally do but for some reason I just didn't last night.  Like I said I really love Fridays and I can't say that I will not be back, but I just wish that they would get it together.",

The majority of people seems to know each other and we're having conversations across the whole bar.    There was a person at the bar who was a regular and - without judging - apparently has a mental disorder.   She was arguing with the staff over her \"to go\" order and eventually tried to leave without paying.  This caused a major scene.   Everyone in the restaurant saw the whole situation.    Ok.  So, this was just one day.  But according to the bartender, it's something that happens frequently.    You can judge for yourself.  But with half-dozen other chains nearby, I'm skipping this place.",

My daughter order was completely wrong and they did nothing to accommodate it i ordered extra shrimp with mine didn't seem like it. The only thing that was great was the drinks and the waitets on the floor, they were excellent and helpful..Mgmt sucks here they don't give a shit about the customer or their employees so they can fuck off",

I went out to eat with my friends for her birthday, we had to wait 30 minutes after they said we didn't have a reservation ( we did ). Then they proceed to tell us we did and they didn't see it, they never apologized and sat us quickly. We waited for about 45 minutes and within this time period we ha multiple servers walk by and say our server will be with us soon. My friends ordered their drinks and one soda came out flat. We asked to get a new one, and it was replaced. Some of the guests with us don't eat pork and asked for them off, when they brought the plates there was pork on the plate and when we brought it up, they took it back and just picked the pork out and there was still pork in the appetizers. After all said and done, we asked to get a discount due to all the troubles, they said they would give us a free dessert which we were told we get a free dessert due to her birthday, the server then told security that one of the guests was not going to pay and they used physical force to remove the guest from the table, ripped her shirt as well. All in all very unprofessional establishment, managers were no where to be found, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else.",

Great sports bar NOT for for True dining customers.

We were enjoying our salads and about 1/3 into the salad, I uncovered the top half of a grasshopper.  I was mortified, screamed and nearly threw up all over the table.  The manager on duty came over and apologized and said the salad comes prepacked from a distributor and the severed grasshopper must have been in one of those bags.  Disgusting.  I was imagining that I must have eaten the other half and was barely holding on.  We asked that a member of the executive team contact us....and of course no one called.  Its been several weeks now.  I can't bring myself to eat a salad now unless I prepare it myself.  I wish there was some way to post the pic....Never ever visiting any of their establishments again.  I managed to post the pic to their main page....check it out if you have a strong stomach.  ugh",

We were pretty disappointed to be seated and told this location does not honor this deal. Instead we settled for a happy hour special blue moon and spinach dip. They were alright, nothing special. I gave a star because our server was good, not great.   I also called in a couple of days ago to see if they offered the updated promotion where you can mix and match unlimited apps for $12. Still a no. To be honest, I'm not sure how this place is still standing. This is a huge promotion that should bring in a lot of business, this location is passing up a good opportunity if you ask me.   Won't be coming back here without an exceptional happy hour or the unlimited app deal.",

So just FYI - if u are a customer here u might want to rethink as you are a liar! Please share so others liars are in the know.  Now mind you- this manager treated me this way all over $6.00.",

We asked what the drink specials were because we sat at the bar, and this night they were Long Island Ice Tea's....if you ask me there really is no other way to drink iced tea! But they were as expected, delicious!  For appetizers we got the pot stickers and the spicy queso beef dip and for our meals we both tried the Jack Daniels Chicken Duo- which has grilled chicken on a skewer over jasmine rice and then sesame style chicken with a side of Jack Daniels glaze. YUM!  The pot stickers were wonderful, I absolutely love the schezwan  dipping sauce! The spicy queso dip was good too...it's a little weird because it comes with topped with half a taco shell...but once you take that off it's full of yummy queso and jalapenos and spices for a nice kick!   The Chicken duo was delicious! I loved the grilled chicken especially which over the rice with the glaze was a perfect pairing.   Love that they have this deal, and hope it stays around longer!",

Our sever didn't come to our table for 15 mins and when she did it took another 10 to get our drink orders-  all sodas no alcohol so there was no waiting for the bartender.  We ordered our meals-  all ordered a different  burgers and when she brought them out she said, \"I don't know which one is which and put all three down and said y'all can figure it out\".  Things didn't get any better from there-- our receipts came- two of us paid with cards and one with cash-- everything was brought back to our table- person that paid with cash wasn't given any change (should have been $3.38 back) and myself and my friend signed our receipts.  Service has been so bad we took pics of our signed receipts.  Today checking my bank account I was over charged on my card by over $9 and my friend by over $3.  I called the restaurant 5x and let it ring and ring with no answer.  Called again and asked for the manager and was hung up on.  Called back and person answered and I asked for the manager and she said you are speaking to her.  Explained being overcharged and she did apologize but said she needed to look for the actual signed rcpts bc a machine was down and would call me right back.  That was over 3 hrs ago.  I also asked for a call from the GM as I am concerned about how many other people the sever has stolen from.   Beware and check your receipts!",

The server took our drink orders, I got a water and a frozen drink from the bar and my husband got some slush drink that he got maybe 4 minutes before the food came out. When the food finally came out I still had not received my water. I had to ask the server again for the water and at this point I wasn't even worried about my mixed drink. My husbands steak was over cooked, they left off the whiskey sauce AND the shrimp. When he told the server about it he brought the saints and fried shrimp even tho my husband wanted grilled shrimp. You could tell the server clearly didn't care about his tables. We would have asked to speak with the manager, however the table beside us had asked for the manager several minutes earlier and the manager never came. Their Ofer was incorrect too and the lady h Sri track down the server to get a box. When another severe was found she told her the manager said \"well they will just have to wait and I'll get there when I get there.\" Needless to say both our tables grabbed boxes and left and never got to speak to the manager. Thank goodness I'm an honest person because we truly thought about leaving without paying... something we have never done and never thought that the thought would ever even cross our minds. Oh yeah my frozen drink did finally come out.. AFTeR we asked another server I flagged down and got boxes from. Worst customer service ever. I know we won't be returning and sounded like the couple seated across from us won't be either.",

    "text": "Called in one to-go order of chicken tenders and mashed potatoes at 5:29 PM on 11/26/18. The gal on the phone had all the personality that I imagine a non-mashed potato might have, and she informed me that it would be about 15 minutes until my food would be ready. I walked into the restaurant to get my to-go order at 5:50 (20 minutes after placing my order) and didn't receive my food until 6:10 - no exaggeration. The place was very empty for it being dinnertime on W.T. Harris, and it didn't take long to understand why (though I had plenty of time to observe). It took a moment for the hostess to get to the stand when I walked in, but I figured maybe they were short-staffed and she was helping someone in the back. I informed her that I was there for a to-go order, and she said, \"yeah, at the bar.\" I went to the bar and was greeted warmly by a young blonde woman who asked for my name, and for the name of another girl who had walked in at the same time as I did for a to-go order. The blonde bartender is absolutely the only staff member worth keeping. I've seen livelier movie zombies than the staff in this joint. In the twenty minutes that I sat at the bar waiting for my one order of chicken tenders and mashed potatoes, there were about three staff members standing at the entrance to the kitchen at any given time. It seemed that the issue with my wait was that the girl who had initially taken my order had heard my name as Brittany instead of Whitney. Still inexcusable as again, the place was dead and I highly doubt there were hordes of Brittany's that ordered the same thing at the same time as I did. All they had to do was ask what my order was. By the time I got to the cash register to pay for my meal, which had apparently taken upwards of 40 minutes to prepare, I ran into the gal who had come in at the same time as I did for her to go order, and who had gotten her food about five minutes before I did. I asked her what she was doing back, and she stated that she had come back in because they forgot her fries and sauce, and she recommended that I check my order. The young lady who took my payment was not apologetic whatsoever for my wait (the only person who apologized was the bartender) and I was offered no kind of discount for my wait. The entire time that myself and the other girl were waiting for Peppy McSmiles to help us get out of this godforsaken restaurant, it appeared that upper management were just standing around listlessly by the kitchen door which was close by. One of them should have taken over for the gal at the register and allowed her to do something that wasn't direct customer interface if she was having a bad day. I get that there are hard days in customer service, but it was clear that the vibe of this particular place was off. Not sure if it's a management issue, but I would literally recommend cleaning house and keeping only the bartender who was working. I probably saw upwards of 8 staff members in that very dead restaurant, so there should have been no reason that someone who called ahead for literally one meal should have had to wait upwards of 40 minutes. I live five minutes from this location and regardless of convenience, I won't be spending another dime here.",

The last 4 times I've been in this place, I've waited almost 10 minutes to be greeted and the ONLY reason I WAS greeted was because I physically got up to speak with a manager about NOT being greeted after 10 minutes. Food is shit too. Everything tastes like I bought the TGI frozen apps from the grocery store. Piss poor service, managers are half ass apologetic and it's a disappointment bc it's so close to me but I will NEVER repeat EVER give this place my time or money again.",

It is now 8:05 pm and I still have not been given my drink and we are now almost 2hrs here still with no drinks or food.. I've asked for actually waiting on manager to come out now. Fortunately the manager -Mike was professional and apologetic for the service or lack there of due them being short staffed. We asked why didn't the hostess tell us they had a major service delay oppose to 15 min wait. I would not recommend this location for anyone who has a life to live and not be held hostage waiting on service. It has been 10mins since the manager was out. Still no drink and my order finally came and the order is wrong. I don't even want a discount. I could've cooked my own dinner for how long this has taken .  Im going to Applebee's.",

I have frequented this location so this review of staff is based on 10+ visits. The kitchen tonight wasn't executing on quality. Not only was my medium steak well done it was cut numerous times and overly drenched in sauce. My husband had to slice his own chicken and peppers in the pasta which was plopped on top of a bed of noodles and sauce when it arrived at our table... Minus 1.5 stars for that.  They must have ran out of glasses so our fountain beverages came out in bar glasses that weren't clean minus .5 star. The floor looked as if a 5 year old took to it...food, sticky substances you name it so .5 of a star loss. I get that its Sunday and it was busy and they were short staffed so .5 star gained for effort.   All in all it seemed chaotic and wasn't worth the 45 minute wait so for experience I subtracted 1 more star. I would visit this location again for convenience but not by choice.",

At that point we realized we needed to place our food order then to insure we would actually eat the same day. 25 mins later 3 of our partie's 18 orders came. 10 mins later the power goes out. After 10 mins, 0% chance of getting any food. Then my friend, they have the balls to bring us a check for all the drinks and the 3 meals. So 3 people get 25% done with their food eating in the dark, the other 15 people look on starving, and THEY GIVE US THE WHOLE BILL, without a penny taken off. Then the kitchen starts smoking and fire trucks come, yet we are in there trying to settle our bill. Needless to say, won't EVER go back there again.",

As for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat.   To top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there.   Eating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon",

If you are looking for this place to be \"family-friendly\", than do not sit in the bar area or do not bring children there after 9pm.  I frequent this particular TGIF's a lot, but I only sit in the bar area because I usually plan to only have drinks and appetizers and to enjoy the excitement of the bartenders and the numerous new people I meet there while in the bar.    I went with a friend on this particular visit to have a girls' night out, have some drinks and have fun! And boy did we definitely have some fun! We ordered the pretzels with the craft beer cheese dipping sauce and chips and salsa as our appetizers. The pretzel appetizer is my favorite and I always get it when I go to TGIF's, the craft beer cheese dipping sauce is very good and is mixed with green onions and bacon pieces. So to wash down the pretzels and chips and salsa we had to order tasty and refreshing drinks. TGIF's has a full service bar and the bar is fully stocked with the best alcohol and they have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, from the traditional drinks to their signature ones. My friend had an Appletini and I had their signature drink, the Captain Morgan Island Rum Punch. The bartenders there on this night stuck their feet in these drinks, because they were AMAZING! The drinks were not watered down, I could taste the alcohol, and we got our money's worth.  After sitting at the bar for awhile, we started to get hungry again, so we ordered an entree and both got the salmon with maison butter, mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley (zucchini, squash and red peppers). It did not take long for our food to come out, our food was hot and very tasty. We ate all of it!  I recommend their bar service to everyone, but do be prepared for it to be crowded, loud and busy, so sit back, grab a drink and have a good time!",

When my party walked in, it didn't seem like the five people at the hostess stand really wanted to greet us and were more concerned with mingling amongst themselves.  We told them we had a table of five, and one of the hostess' informed us it was going to be an hour wait.  Since we were hungry, we walked out of the restaurant, and one of the workers started waving us down because they had an opened table.  The sad part?  The opened table that was already clean was RIGHT BEHIND them.  Five people couldn't see an opened table clearly behind them?  Wow.  After we sat down, we were greeted by a nice waitress, but her service was not all that great.  Through out the night, it was hard to find her or get her attention because she would pass by our table.  She also didn't seem as concerned when I informed her that my appletini glass had a lipstick mark on it.  My friend was able to spot it across from the round table we were sitting at, and she didn't even see it before she handed it to me.    The food was good, but took way too long to receive.  I think that we waited a good 30 minutes for our appetizers.  I don't even know how long we were waiting for our entree as I started getting cranky and moody like I always do when I'm hungry.  I feel that I probably won't be going back to this location again.",

From the time we walked in, we waited about 5 mins for a host to come seat us. He asked if we wanted a table. When we requested a booth it seemed to irritate him. After getting to the table, it took another 10 mins or so for a waitress to assist us. She took the drink order, and the drink my wife ordered came AFTER she was done with her meal. This after they brought her the absolute wrong order. Then it was loud, due to people, and the bartenders.  To end it all the waitress, took a cash tip, and over charged my girl's card  an extra $10, which we found out the next day. Waiting on a call back from the manager till this day. No call back=no going back.",

I wasnt too upset because I was there to enjoy time with my friend.

    "text": "So this is my second night at this location (tonight is Wednesday, showed up Monday night and couldn't get seated because there was not a host and the server seemed incapable of putting us at a table). Tonight I showed up and sat myself in the bar area, though not at the proper location apparently (the server Erin got an attitude about us seating ourselves, even though there was no host or hostess present).   After almost 10 minutes we finally got drinks, and she sent the manager over without our requesting him to try and \"understand why we seated ourselves.\" (I assume that's what the server said)  I informed him about the situation with the host stand both evenings, and then he apologized and took our food order.   During the small meal, the server never stopped at the table. She would only ask \"you doing okay\" as she was walking quickly by. She then came to our table when the meal was almost over and asked if we were done. As we said no, we were still working on the food, she tried to pull the plate away. I then informed her again that we were not done but we would definitely be needing our check.   She walked away and actually hollered loudly to the manager and told him to take us our check while she disappeared into the back.   The manager came over and apologized again, letting us know that she should not be acting that way. Additionally, another server came over and apologized to us, saying she saw the horrid service and felt bad that we had to experience that.   The manager also let us know that he was working on getting the restaurant up to the standard it should be, so I truly hope he evaluates Erin and helps her get better or move on to other opportunities outside TGIFriday's.   You know the service is bad when other servers come over to you and apologize.",

We decided we only wanted to grab a seat at the bar which the hostess rudely said: \"Don't sit in any of the tables near the bar, or in the booths\" (there is definitely a better way to say that to walk-in customers).  The bartenders were barely noticeable. To draw a picture, there were 2 other customers sitting at the bar, and 2 bartenders working. It took a while before one even acknowledged us. They made us a few drinks, but their attitude showed that they didn't really want to be here.   The average 2-star rating says a lot about this place.

The only reason I've had the one enjoyable dine in experience is because of my server Ally who did her very best to correct the wrongs of her staff such as bringing me a burger with the toppings that are advertised on the menu, the utensils that the host is supposed to provide upon seating, and the delay in my party's food being served. I took my mother here for mother's day and she accidently left the card I gave her. She called to see if anyone retrieved it and had to call back 3 more times because the same woman she was speaking to hung up on her when she tried to get an answer on each call back!

You sit at the bar, the bartenders ignore you, no one is EVER at the host stand, and I even had a server tell me they didn't know about the food or if there were any food specials going on that day because they were new. The last and final visit that made me feel the need to post this review was around a week ago. I sat at the bar and ordered NY Strip. The bartender stated that they no longer have it on the menu, so I ordered a filet mignon. I ate my lunch, proceeded to use my rewards (Because I have been a frequent customer of Friday's all over for many years). I noticed the filet was not an option so I waited to ask which to use. The bartender called the manager over to key in my rewards, I handed her  my phone because the option for filet mignon was not listed. I tried to tell her that, but she pretty much ignored me and proceeded to redeem whatever she THOUGHT was OK. After standing there for a couple minutes at the register keying in a code that obviously wasn't working she handed me my phone and said that what I ordered was not available to use my rewards points. And that she took off $12 from my bill to compensate for the cost of the meal. And that I now have 30 days to use the rewards that SHE REDEEMED on my account. First off, the meal was $25, so she only took off half... Secondly, now I am currently rushed to use my rewards in order not to lose them? Her demeanor and tone were not approachable at all, so I paid my bill and left. This location needs a total re-haul of staff all the way up to management level. I've posted so much I don't even have the keystrokes left to talk about a manager that I witnessed pouring liquor into her personal cup, and another talking a child into the kitchen area. These were other times I visited this location. I'm surprised they still have any business coming in.",

They apparently were very short-staffed and our wait times definitely reflected that.   I ordered the New York Sour Crush and the husband ordered a draft beer. We waited almost 45 minutes. I can understand a limited wait time for a cocktail that has to be made, but a beer? Additionally, three members of our party each ordered one of their drinks that has cotton candy and comes with its own shaker. The server came over with a single shaker and tried to split it between all three of them. Only one glass was filled, the other wasn't even halfway and the last didn't see a drop. Once we spoke with management, they came over and the issue was cleared up (i.e. all three people received their drinks), but by this time, I was still waiting for my cocktail, another person had ordered, received and finished their cocktail, my husband was still waiting for his beer and I was just over it. I told the manager she could cancel my drink, but she showed up with it in hand a few minutes after that. I don't know if she didn't hear me or just decided to bring it anyway. For what it's worth, the drink was good. Not good enough to wait for almost an hour, but good all the same.   The food was merely okay as well. I ordered their $14.99 special with the salmon and ribs. The ribs were nicely charred, but incredibly tough. The salmon was moist and had decent flavors. The mashed potatoes were good and the Brussels were okay. This is after I had to send the food back to be reheated, though. It clearly was one of the first meals prepared, but was sitting nowhere near a heat lamp or a warmer. It was barely warm when they brought it out to me.  Eh. I mean, it's TGI Fridays, so it's not like I was expecting to be blown away or whatever, but hot food and drinks in a timely manner really isn't hoping for too much and they did not deliver on that at all.",

Not because of crowds because we were seated immediately but because the service was sooooooo slow. We didn't even get greeted by a waitress until at least 20min after being seated. The waitress although nice seemed to speak in a whispered tone so could never understand her. My friend ordered a side of fried shrimp with her meal, it comes out along with her entree and they're grilled so she sends it back. Few minutes later they come back out with her side of fried shrimp but no main entree. The waitress said they accidentally threw away her main entree so now she has to wait to get another one. By this time she's full from the appetizer and side of shrimp so when the entree came out just asked for a to go box. I don't go here often but the few times I have the experience is always subpar as best. We should have been here an hour and a half at best but because of slow service was there much longer than needed to be. Probably will be a good long few months before I go back. On a good side note the lil mini bundt cake was delish but don't get why it came out in such a huge pan lol",

Entrees came out at 11:20, food was cold and steak that was supposed to be medium was completely burned. and the kitchen was closed meaning no other additional appetizers could be ordered. This could have been avoided if our waiter had checked on the table more than 2x to put in additional ENDLESS orders. Spoke to a manager about the experience and she did not apologize once and instead informed us that she could not discount the endless apps due to it already being at a discounted price (??).

With 2 customers seated at the bar and 4 customers seated at the booth and 4 customers seated outside after 10 minutes no one came to my table to acknowledge me or take an order. However, one server emerged from the back popping fingers and saying with a loud voice to turn the music up. Still no one came to the table so me and my guest left. FIRE THAT WHOLE STAFF. Customer service is important. BYE FRIDAY'S. W. Harris st. Charolette.",

I think it was bad wine I'm weary of this type of chain restaurant. And for good reason.   I came with a group of gals to watch game 4, so it was packed. We were sat in an area where there were no tvs. So I had to squint from afar. Service was decent. I don't think I saw my waitress crack a smile. She wasn't rude, just seemed overwhelmed.  Food was about the same quality as their frozen options in the store. I thought my skins were decent. What I make at home is much better. Salads were served with dressing, which some folks don't like. I just can't get with Fridays. It's one of those places where I can always think of a better option.",

Luckily, we found seats at the bar and were able to enjoy drinks while waiting. I understand a long wait when a place is packed, but they weren't that packed! They had at least 10 tables empty, most that were waiting to be bussed. TGI Friday's tends to become the club after a certain hour so I wasn't surprised to see a cop there starting around 10:30. Once seated, I enjoyed some fries while my friends ordered steak and chicken. The food is decent at Friday's, but the fries have too much seasoning.  I would return to this Friday's for drinks, but wouldn't plan on dining.",

Oh wait, forgot to mention, seems as if the kitchen dropped the pepper on my whole plate. My magician of a server decided to charge me for the replacement fries.

Service - The service is mediocre, the servers really don't seem like they want to be there at all, and the friendliness is forced.   Atmosphere - Causal, the table was clean, though the menu was sticky and dirty. Trash was left on my table the whole meal.   Food - I'm a little upset with my food. I got a new menu item, the shrimp and lobster pasta. The lobster was tough and tasted a weird \"dirty\" taste, not flaky and light like it should be. The pasta sauce was so heavy I felt sick after eating a few bites. I'm sad I spent $19 on that meal. That's all I had besides a water and a coke.",

It literally took 15-20mins for our waters to arrive and we had no silverware. There were other people bringing our waters and silverware(totally fine) and we didn't see a sign of our waitress, so when someone asked: \"are you guys being helped\"? I immediately asked for another waiter. My friend stated before she was aware that the young lady was our waitress, she saw her in the bathroom on the phone. Hint: that's why you didn't know our table was yours!   Once the 2nd waitress came, she made certain we had what we needed. I was hesitant to order anything because it took 20mins for water and this place was not packed. When the bill arrived the waitress gave us 30% off. Because of the experience we received, we still have a good tip because it wasn't her fault.",

When I finally cornered one of them into helping me she said, \"I'll go check on that\" and then proceeded to spend the next 6 minutes shuckin' and jivin' with the bartender before walking the opposite direction of the kitchen.  The next server also agreed to check on my take out order \"as soon as I get done putting in this other order.\"  After a few minutes of that she promptly forgot to go check.  A third server begrudgingly went to go check on it.  It was ready and had been ready for quite some time.  Nothing like stone cold steak with soggy vegetables after a hard days work.  A first-world problem to be sure, but a problem nonetheless.  It had been about 8 years since I last ate at a TGIFridays.  Here's to another 8 years.",

The table stayed dirty full of dishes and beer bottles the entire time we were there. That's disgusting!! The manager on duty walked passed that table several times and it didn't phase her. She never asked us how our food was nor did she speak. This place is no good. Our waitress Brittney took 40 minutes to come by to check on us. This is our last visit  here. Very poor service, by the way, the place was not busy.",

How ever our server was good, she gave us discounts and gave us chips and salsa. Which it was very appreciated. I feel this Friday's people are so scatted brain, not once no one came to our table and asked us are we ok. Our poor waitress was running around. I just wish I had a better time there.",

I sat at the bar and the service was gruesome. Not much better this time. Food is consistently Friday's standard, but these people make an effort to ignore you. Good bartenders sweep the bar to check each customer. Not sure what these guys are doing.  Only gave two stars cause the food was what I expected and it showed up hot. No one asked if it was ok or if I needed anything else......",

She tells me to contact door dash and have them get a cup of jack daniels whiskey. So I guess the cook does not have to glaze anything and it's on the customer to get a cup of glaze sauce.

Meanwhile, we had to wait at the entrance -- which is beside the bar. At the bar were *seriously* the loudest, most obnoxious people in a 6-person cluster. At the 30- minute interval, the hostess -- who showed nothing but indifference -- indicated they were going to seat us at the bar-- even closer to the obnoxious patrons. They finally sat us at a table on the opposite side of the bar....and the noise level was still unbearable  I got my order to go....that's how obnoxious they were. They wouldn't take kale out of my salad - which All the salads contain...so settled on the French dip. Got back to the hotel only to discover they hadn't included the jus. THE JUS! What was I going to dip my French DIP in? The watered-down Manhattan I ordered? Avoid at all costs!  BTW... Someone needs to tell them kale is so 5 years ago.",

By the time we got the food the order was wrong and the waitress was no where to be found. When we ask someone if they can find our waitress another 15 minutes went by. At that time my aunt decided she's going to eat it anyways since it took forever. Then we over heard the table next to us asked her about their food. She told them she forgot to put in their order.

    "text": "Tonight was by far the most horrible dining experience of my life. I ordered a cocktail from the bar and as I was sipping away something poked me in my gum and when I closed my mouth all of the way I realized there was glass in my mouth. That's right glass from a broken glass. I pulled at least 3 pieces of glass from my mouth. I know accidents happen but as far as customer service no one had any urgency around helping me. I don't know if I swallowed any and all I was asked was if I wanted another drink. Ummm. No ma'am. I asked for the manager 3 different times and after 45 minutes he came. The staff including the manager was really nice but not trained at all to deal with this issue. As a customer that frequently visits that chain of restaurant I expected customer service and I did not receive that. I expected the manager to offer at minimum a discount on my food but I was not offered any type of customer service. I had to ask for the cocktail to be removed from my ticket and I had to ask to fill out an incident report. I took a picture of everything because this staff is not trustworthy at all. Not to mention outside of that we had to wait 44 mins for 2 appetizers. They even gave us small plastic cups to drink out of because the waitress said and I quote\"they broke all of the glasses last night\" so now I'm thinking did they break them at the bar??? Am I the only customer that had to chew on glass? I work in customer service so I know things can get out of hand but I also expect exceptional customer service. And I for one will never visit that location on WT Harris again. I actually told them a couple times that they may want to check the sugar at the bar because I'm not sure if that's where the glass came from and it took me saying that 3 times to say that for someone to actually check it. I am highly upset and disappointed at the service I received.",

I took my daughter to eat and this was the second Fridays we went to because of wait time.  Server was nice however she was so busy to check on us as much as I would've liked.  I did however enjoy my food, I had the Grilled Salmon, which was great.  Platter was a bit small but I can't complain because I was there because I redeemed points,  so my meal was free.  I did tell the server before hand that I had the coupon but she still rang it up incorrectly and it took about 7 minutes for her to come back to correct the issue.  I'm glad that I didn't have any immediate needs to leave because I would've been more upset for waiting even longer.  I am just glad that my daughter enjoyed her meal. I will try again during non peak times to see if I change my mind about service.",

    "text": "We visited TGI Friday's during our lunch break from work.  The place was pretty dead and we were promptly seated.  Normally, I would love a table by a lot of windows.  However, it was winter and it was almost as cold inside as it was outside.  If I wasn't afraid of spilling my lunch down my leather jacket and scarf, I would have worn both of them during my entire meal.  Trying to eat a healthy, lightish lunch, I ordered a Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad because it sounded the best of all the salads.  It had an \"RPRP\" label next to it (Right Portion, Right Price) and was cheaper than the other salads, though, so I was afraid it was going to be a tiny salad and I'd still be hungry.  Thankfully, it was pretty huge and, therefore, filling.  I really enjoyed it and everything on it looked very fresh.    We only chose Friday's for lunch because I had a buy one get one free coupon.  Otherwise, I would have gone somewhere else because Friday's DOES NOT HAVE ANY LUNCH SPECIALS.  You heard me.  I think they're the only restaurant I've ever been to that does not have a differentiation between lunch and dinner options and prices.  Do I want to spend dinner prices at lunch?  Hell no.  So while we had really good meals and great service for our lunch, dinner prices at lunchtime and a freezing cold dining room deserve the removal of two stars from this review.  Shame on Friday's for not offering lunch specials to its dining guests.",

However, even though the place was mostly empty, she took a very long time to get us refills. I suppose some of that was due to the Panther's game going on on the TV (they won another game!). The mozeralla sticks we got as an appetizer were good. The harvest apple salad I got was okay. But, the chicken tenders my friend got were terrible, and chicken tenders aren't hard to make decent.",

The service was nice, but on a Wednesday night (and it was actually fairly busy at the bar), you would have thought that they'd be a little more attentive.   Those on the other side of the bar that the bartender had their backs to were serviced less unless you happened to be friends with the bartenders.   At least so it seemed.  Didn't bother me as much since I was just having dinner and as long as my Coke was refilled, I was good.  I had a Jack Daniels Flatiron steak (medium rare).   They might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak.   When you cut into it, there were two different \"red colors\" which basically means that the darker red is \"raw\" while the other red was \"cooked\".   Not a good sign if you can't cook steaks at the right temperature.   And with meat, it's always better to be more conservative with the timing.  Everything else was fine, but being that it's a chain, I expected at least average ratings which the food part didn't induce.",

    "text": "Oh TGIF Friday's, how could you get some many things wrong with one simple order? My boyfriend and I placed an online order on a late Thursday night (it was around 10:15pm). He ordered the buffalo wingman's burger without the tomato and I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich -- No substitutions, except that he did not want tomatoes in his burger. Once we placed the order, we were instructed that it'd be ready for pickup in the next 20 minutes. When we arrived in approximately 20 minutes, we ended up waiting for an additional 15 minutes. Mind you, it was a Thursday night, so it wasn't that crowded. We left once we got our food and drove about 10 minutes home. We settled in and were about to enjoy our food, but then realized that his buffalo wingman's burger did not have buffalo wings....instead, his beef patty was topped with a chicken patty (Please refer to the pictures). Sorry, but how could you get a simple order so wrong??? So we ended up driving back to the restaurant. It took about 15 minutes for them to make a new burger and we left, again. When we got back to our place, he had a tomato in his burger, although he had asked for it to be left out. And I didn't get a chance to inspect my food closely the first time, but I realized too late that the Cajun onions in my chicken sandwich were nowhere to be found. (Remember, it's supposed to come with my sandwich - I made no substitutions.) My food was also cold at this point. We just don't understand how they could have screwed up a small and simple online order so badly. We will not be returning.",

There is plenty of room in the handicapped bathroom to put in a changing table. There is also not enough room on the counter because the sinks take up every bit of room. I think it should be a law that restaurants have baby changing tables in every bathroom; men's and women's. I honestly don't want to patronize a restaurant that doesn't meet my needs. I love the food at TGI Friday's but it's not worth the inconvenience. My choice is change the baby in the car or on the table. I hope someone in management will see this review and talk to corporate about making the necessary changes. Until then I will no longer eat here.",

Shortly after she hung up told us she was sorry & the wait would be 5mins.   The phone kept ringing & she kept picking up & immediately hanging the calls up on the restaurant phone.   We got seated & the waiter took about 10mins to come greet us. She finally came took our order for drinks & appetizer & walked away. She was a friendly girl but it took her forever to come back with our drinks & I didn't understand because it wasn't as busy as it usually is when I come.   We asked for water with our drinks & my boyfriend had to remind her 15mins later by calling her to our table. The appetizer finally came before we got our water. We got the mild boneless chicken bites & they were okay. They were a little on the crispy side & my vegetables wasn't that fresh.    30 mins after we got our appetizers the waitress FINALLY brought our food mind you she never came to check on us nor did she even serve or appetizers another lady did & that lady didn't even know witch table to serve.  When the food arrived, m fries looked burnt & chicken sandwich looked really burnt. I can be dramatic sometimes so I tasted both & they were disgusting ! They were tasteless & burnt !   I was very upset because we already waited so long to get our food & it wasn't right ! Plus I had to wait 10mins more for her to come back ! Not to mention they messed up on my bf order too. He ordered chicken, shrimp, & loaded potatoes. He got chicken, regular Mashed potatoes & no shrimp !   At this point I wasn't hungry any more so I waited 5more minutes for the waitress to come back & 15 more because my bf wanted his food to go.   Horrible Chief, horrible customer service I wouldn't recommend this Friday's there is something always going on with them & the wait is way too long !",

My biggest issue was with the service we received from Staci. Now for the record I was a server/bartender and manager of a restaurant for over 4 years. There was now greeting at all. Like hi my name is Staci what can I get you to drink. Instead we got a what do you want to drink. I had the endless appetizer and my fiance had the flat iron steak. The appetizers for one took forever to come out of the kitchen and this did not seem to be tho kitchens fault as the food was warm at this point and that's due to it sitting in a window for longer than it should (again I would know managed a restaurant for 4+ years). Every time she would ask what I would like next for my endless appetizer it came out as follows \"what do you want next\". She never once asked us how the meal tasted or checked in with us. The only time our server ever stopped at the table was to drop something we asked for off or when we ordered, no other times. The other issues is neither her nor any other server, bus boy, manager no one else asked if everything was ok either. One of my biggest issues was no one taking the plates we were done with out of our way. I had 3 app plates and my fiance plate were all sitting on our table even when we left. My fiance had finished his meal about 15-20 mins before my final appetizer came out and still no one too the plate even though we put the napkins and everything overtop of the plate. Every server should know the proper steps to serving especially in a decent restaurant.  All in all not sure if we will be back to this location and if we do probably will just do Togo because again the food was just fine.",

    "text": "Advice to Service Manager: Don't put new-hires alone on a Saturday night shift Advise to New-hire server:  Don't blame the kitchen and bar for your incompetence  We arrived on a Saturday night and were seated right away.  We didn't wait too long for initial server visit, and I could tell by her fumbling through notes that she was probably new.  When she couldn't tell me what the seasonal draft was, but quickly told me that they only had bottles, I should have asked for another table.  We ordered our appetizer and boys' food first, then our entrees.    The food came out in a timely manner, but then we didn't see the waitress for a while.  We were all hoping for a refill and I kept looking around, but never saw her even walking near the registers.  All the other wait staff were moving around, checking on tables, but ten minutes goes by before even see her, and had to flag her down.    I asked for refills on sodas and water, and for a draft of another brew, then another ten minutes goes by before she returns with refills and news that all the draft beers were back in bottles.    What?   \"They don't have any more drafts.\"  Fine, another bottle.  Still no entrees.  Five minutes later she returns with a bottle, puts it on the table, walks on.  We have empty plates and cups sitting on the edge of the table, and start looking around for her again.  No sign.    Finally, after flagging her down again and ASKING about our food, she goes into the back, then comes out and tells us that our food has been delivered to another table, and would we like the kitchen to start plates for us to eat in or take-out.    Blank stare.    I asked if the kitchen almost had ours ready since there was a mix-up.  No, she says, she has to tell them if we are taking it out. I ask \"What did the manager on duty say?\"  She said \"He's in the kitchen.\"  Blood begins to boil: \"We will Not be eating in OR take-out, please just give us our check.\"  Comes back a few minutes later, bill is $49+ and she walks off.  I look over the ticket: double charged for drinks, charged for draft brews that apparently didn't even exist, and No response from the manager.    I ask the nearest server if she could could kindly summon the manager for me.  He was out in less than a minute, very courteous, and asks what is wrong.  I explain, in this much detail, what had happened.  He informs me that he has no knowledge of any misdirected food NOR has he taken anything off our ticket.  He then took the ticket and cleared it out except for the two bottles of re-bottled draft.  I left a minimal gratuity based on charged beverages alone; I hate being lied to.  Will not be returning to this location. We MAY try another franchise, but with so many other restaurants that actually TRY, why should I bother?  The chain as a whole has lowered standards too much to be taken seriously as a restaurant.  They are pretty much a bar with extra tables nowadays.",
