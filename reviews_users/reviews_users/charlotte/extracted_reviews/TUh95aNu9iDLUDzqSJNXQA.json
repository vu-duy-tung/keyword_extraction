Nevertheless, I have visited twice in two weeks. The first time I had the bake chicken, black eye-peas, and mac-n-cheese (dinner roll). My plate was delicious and filling. The next time I had Thursday's special, the \"Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes\" and for my side I had the lima beans with a piece of corn bread. I was once again impressed and satisfied by the quality and size of the portions on the plate and with the taste. I will be back and continue to support family businesses and African American entrepreneurship in the city! Grace & Peace!",

We had the fried whiting, fried chicken, yams, macaroni, and cornbread. They were all excellent. The seasoning used in the batter is perfect...not too salty, not too much pepper. The fish and chicken wasn't greasy! Thank goodness! Macaroni and yams were perfect. The cornbread was a little dry but was fixed with the addition of butter. They also offer custom lemonades. You can add a flavor shot: watermelon, blueberry, pineapple, mango, and strawberry. Although tasty the price was steep at $3 each 16oz cup. There are no refills with the lemonades and way too much ice (they have a sign that says they do not offer a light ice option) They were out of sweet tea, they cost $2 and if you want a refill it's $0.50. The staff was amazingly nice and accommodating. We will eat here again but next time it will be pick up and we will not purchase drinks.  Thanks ERD and we wish you much success!!!!",

The catfish and shrimp were delish, all the sides were delicious especially the green beans. We've been back twice since then.",

I don't have to drive all over town searching as they are close to my neighborhood, and they're always on point.  I tend to visit mostly on Sunday's because I love the baked chicken and dressing special.  During the week, I usually get a veggie plate (lima beans, green beans, black eyed peas, and collards).  For dessert, it begins and ends with the banana pudding.....love it!  The owners are always super friendly and treat everyone like family.",

Also fried schrimp is to die for (10 large schrimps). The only thing is that they are out of stuff easily, so make sure to call before coming to check availability of dishes you want to avoid a waste of your time. Also, don't order online with this one, I over heard them saying that they tried to cancel their online delivery account but couldn't get it done. If you order online, the restaurant will not see it nor process it. This poor girl drove all the way only to find out her order was never even put through the system. Please pick up your phone instead of relying on internet with this one!",

I thought maybe they closed at 6 but the sign said they closed at 8. We weren't really in the mood for what seemed like would be left over food. The staff suggested that we come the next day but we had driven up from Columbia to try the food so that was not an option. I would suggest getting there early if you want a good selection.

I love that they don't make their sides with meat!  The collards had a good flavor on them, but were a little salty.  However, I still smashed them with some vinegar!  The potato salad was a little more soupy than I prefer, and was sweeter than normal, but still very good.  I guess I would suggest making it a little chunkier because the potato salad was more like mashed potato salad.   The whiting was delicious, not too greasy, super fresh,  not too much breading, and well seasoned.  It tasted fresh too and had a decent amount of meat on the pieces.    I had the sweet tea to drink, and that was super sweet. I'm guessing the chef loves sugar lol.  I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a free refill.  At least one, but each refill is 50 cents I believe.  It was a little pricey for the whole meal + drink + tip, but I would come back here, and maybe not order as much and just get water. The service was great though, the people were nice and relaxed, I got a good vibe from this place.  It is quite quaint so I see it being more of a takeout place than dining in.",

I especially love the way that the story of the restaurant's namesake and the family is told on the menu and wall decorations.  I was also impressed that the owner (Cynthia Davenport) came out from the kitchen to greet me personally and help me select my take-out order from the menu. She mentioned that they were promoting their new restaurant by leaving Flyers around the neighborhood and graciously allowed me to use the same coupon that she was passing out even though I had not received the flyer yet (free tea with purchase.)  Even though the mac and cheese was mediocre, the Fried Chicken was much better than I expected and the banana pudding won my heart forever. I am looking forward to trying their other meats and sides and desserts . . .",

I placed my order and waited about 40 mins for my food. I didn't mind. I wasn't in a rush, I understand the difference with small business operations, and cooking with love takes time. While waiting I read other reviews and saw people complaining about the wait time. But if you went to a chain restaurant and sat down, it would be the same. I understand when you order to go, you expect it to be 15-20 mins max. But there is only one person in the kitchen cooking here and quality takes time. So just come with the mindset it will be a little bit of a wait, but know it will be well worth it. When I got my food, she personally thanked my for my patience. The customer service was great from beginning to end. Even the way the food was packaged was done perfectly.  Now the food. It. Was. Amazing!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. This is what I'm looking for when I want soul food! It's not \"southern cooking\" like the other restaurants. This was from the soul! I was so excited while eating that I could barely wait to review. This is the first time I've ever ordered soul food and it actually tasted like home cooking that came right out of my grandma's kitchen. Most other places don't taste as authentic. I will definitely come back. And I'll wait an hour if I have to lol. You can't rush greatness and I'm glad she doesn't compromise her quality for time. This is now the only place in Charlotte that I will go to for soul food.  I wouldn't change a thing about my experience today and would highly recommend!",

Unfortunately, they were about to close (it was almost 3pm) so did not have too many options left. They cook everything for the day and once they run out, they are out. But I was able to get chicken, mac and cheese, candied yams and the mango lemonade. While I usually eat white meat, I tend to find it dry and lacking in flavor at most places. For white meat, the chicken was surprisingly flavorful. The candied yams were really good, a little too sweet for me but I enjoyed them. Definitely recommend the mango lemonade if you enjoy mango. Also, staff was super friendly.   I'm not sure how busy it gets but their parking lot is on the smaller side which may be a challenge during lunch time rush.   I would definitely go back. Hopefully, I'll be in the area again and able to go earlier.",

Chef Cynthia was awesome.  She was super cool and treated me like family. When i got my order, it looked like a work of art.  Let me tell you... that was the longest ride home EVER!   Everything tasted amazing. There's no other way to describe it. I give ERDS a 5/5. I highly recommend them. Please have patience, it will be worth it.",

The mac & cheese that was to take 45 minutes was done. The fish I ordered had not been dropped. Had they told me they wanted to ensure it was hot, I would have accepted the explanation. However, it was was not dropped until I had been there for more than 5 minutes. The moral of this review is to be ready to wait for your order to be prepared. It did not appear that any call-in orders would be ready upon arrival.",

    "text": "I'll echo Vic's review: All the YES! This is what Yelp is all about. I don't know why else I'd find myself in this particular strip mall except for the fact that one of my fellow Yelp-a-holics just happened to post a raving review. Three days later, here I am ready for lunch.  You walk in and are immediately immersed in the True family feel. The wall on the left has a large \"Family Tree\" collection of pictures. There are only about six tables and the few people in the restaurant were taking their food to go. I got a sick S.O. at home and thinking that Soul Food would make her feel a bit better, I was taking mine on the road as well. Robert (who I later learned was the chef's son) took my order and was very warm and welcoming.  While waiting on my order Robert asked how I heard about them and I told him that my pal Vic raved about the place. Smiles and hollers in the kitchen all around began as apparently Vic made a great impression on the whole staff. It's wonderful to see that they genuinely care about their customers and appreciate them even from the first visit. After about 10 minutes, I got my food in hand and goin' home.  I got the Chicken & Catfish, along with Mac & Cheese and Green Beans. Chicken was moist, breaded perfectly, and simply seasoned. Dark meat done right, the fry was outstanding. I don't have a ton of experience with catfish but the breading was light and the fish moist, flaky, and had a simple yet satisfyingly meaty flavor. I was expecting a lot of grease from my past encounters with Soul Food but everything was respectably balanced as far as the fat goes.  Mac & Cheese, man oh man. First of all, the portions are HUGE. The seasoning was on point, from the cheese 'sauce' to the pasta itself. The green beans had a depth of flavor that is easily overlooked. Cooked with bits of (I'm assuming) pork that translate to subtle smokiness, I'm in heaven.  One more thing to note: The CORNBREAD. Offered often, noted seldom. It's so easy to grab a piece of the crumbly stuff and forget all about it. This was some of the best cornbread I've ever had. Granny, I love you, but your cornbread got nothing on ERD! Great coarse texture, sweet, moist, insert bliss here.  At this point I'm not sure which I liked better, the meat or the sides! Like I said, who'da thought some of the best chicken around would be here? You could blink and miss it!  Krissy and I split a peach cobbler and it was great as well. A lot of places go wayyy too sweet with cobblers but ERD took a different route and upped the spices. Either cloves or allspice, very unique warm & spicy profile that complimented the breading of the cobbler nicely.  My food-loving dudes, show this place some love. Love, love, LOVE, is the only description that does this place justice. A lot of LOVE going into this food and a loving family running the place. Next time I'll dine in just to be around these folks. Hopefully they got a wheelbarrow to cart me back to the car!",

We used to come often and we expressed our concerns over a year ago. We tried to order again today and our food wasn't ready after an hour per usual. I called in my order at 4:10, they called back 3 minutes later to say that the macaroni and cheese was not ready and it would be 45 minutes instead of 25 minutes. At this point, I knew they were up to their usual antics. We got to the restaurant at 5:15 and the food still needed another 10 minutes. I told her to cancel The order, it's not like it was ready anyway. I was speaking with a customer in front of me and the owner felt the need to come to the front for whatever reason, even though I wasn't speaking to her. She got defensive because I told her that it's ridiculous that the food is never ready when customers arrive, and that her business practices were awful. She got defensive per usual. They should just shut back down. The customer in front of me was also pissed because she called in her order and still had to wait another 15 minutes. She said she wouldn't be back.  and obviously neither will we. Instead of apologizing for your role in not having an effective business plan, you huff and puff with an attitude. Oh well. Good luck.",

Collectively, we had sides of collard greens, rice and gravy, and cornbread. It was a to-go order. We all enjoyed our food. I was a little disappointed that we couldn't order what we really wanted because they were out of a lot of items since it was about an hour before closing when we got there.  But it's understandable since things are pretty much made to order.  Nevertheless, our food was tasty and we will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Soul food, by definition, is making something great out of something down market.  And it's not easy to do, especially consistently.  Like the crack of the bat that signals a home run, ERD's hits it out of the park with their execution of \"low\" ingredients.  Pow.  My lunch order was pretty straightforward:  fried fish, collard greens, and corn bread with a can of soda.  Price came in around $12 which seems a little high, and I waited about 15 minutes for my order to arrive at my table.  While those accustomed to quick and cheap might decide otherwise, I'm willing to pay up while waiting for what's happening in the kitchen.  Goodness simmered with pride.  I struggle to communicate just how well the flavors played off each other.  Balanced, constrained, and tight is the best I come up with. The fish was piping hot, perfectly seasoned, and flaky.  I dabbed some Louisiana Hot Sauce on it just for variety, but it didn't need any help.  The collards were deep in flavor, not overly salted, and \"to the tooth\" tender.  It's like they had a story to tell if you had time to listen. Wow.  If you're in the mood for some of the area's best soul food, cooked to order, then ERD's is way, way up on my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter.  For my 300th review I heartily say, \"Go here.\"",

The fish was excellently seasoned and fried, honestly didn't even need a condiment though I do like some hot sauce. The mac was cheesy and buttery and the green beans also full of flavor. For me, every bite was the epitome of my memories of these southern foods as a child. Lots of restaurants serve southern food that lacks the depth of flavor that the real dishes have, but not ERD's. I'd say its like having dinner at your grandmother's, but it might just be better. Even the cornbread (a food I have never loved) was tasty. My only critique would be to add homemade condiments, but this is a growing family business so you can't expect everything.   The best part, however, is how welcoming the people are to new and returning guests. Not only did we get a full explanation of the menu, but lots of tips for future visits. It wasn't crazy busy the night my bf and I were there, but we were warned that other times can be much more hectic. We'll def be calling ahead to try some of the Sunday specials soon and hopefully get our hands on some fried okra. Yum.",

We tried the shrimp platters and you can tell the food was fresh and hot. Dirty rice and shrimp really made this place a 5 star. Many of the items were sold out that day but that is a good sign for a small business. I would rather you sell out of something that carry over and try to reconstituted the next day. This is not fast food but the wait while they cook to order it is pleasant. Ambiance is like a comfortable kitchen table with pleasant Cookout music in the background. Prices are reasonable as you have family history and experience cooking the food. If you blink you miss the location but the food is larger in quality than any chain.    Stop by and try the fish or chicken and dirty rice you will be sure to leave with a smile.   Bonus - They cater and I would suggest if on your lunch break call ahead they will take good care of you.",

I got the flounder (that was the only thing they had left out of the fish). It was okay. I was not wowed. I got the Mac and cheese as the side because that was the only thing they had left besides butterbeans. The Mac and cheese was not good. I didn't get cornbread but a cold roll instead. The cashier was friendly. I don't think I would eat here again....unless I got when they first open at 12 and have everything available. Also I felt like my food was overpriced.

The young man behind the counter was all smiles and great to interact with both in ordering and in just shooting the breeze as they were not busy while I waited on my order.    There was so much that I wanted to try but I settled on fried chicken, yams and mac n cheese.  I was a little early for the quarter or half fried chicken but he let me know they could hook me up with some fried wings and that was good enough for me.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and I have to say that it was hard not to tear into it on the drive home given how good it smelled.  However, I waited and can say that it tasted as good as it smelled.  It was clear that the food, especially the two sides, were made with love and that goes for the cornbread that came with it too.  It was a perfect blend of moist, sweet, savory.  Can't wait to get back for some flounder or catfish or really, most anything else I read on the menu.  Nice job ERD's!",

We stopped by on a Sunday night to quell our fried chicken needs and we left with some new friends who make some killer food.  The grub: SO good! I could eat those green beans by the gallon. But don't just shove these babies down your throat!!! Let the after-taste just simmer on your tongue for a while. Take your time, it took a while to make and should take a while to eat. The mac and cheese was on point and so was the chicken. I can honestly say (as well my wife) that the skin off the thighs was just a little bit (or slightly larger bit) of pure heaven. Cannot what to try the shrimp and fish next time.  The joint: Like walking into a friends house. The young man at the counter is the son of the chef. His brother also works in the kitchen. So it's all single family run. He was so gregariously friendly when we walked in that I thought he already knew me and that I had forgotten how! The soul of the soul food joint is not just the food, it's in it's people. This place has it all in buckets! Before it we walked out with our spoils, we had taken pics and sat to chat about how the place came to be. This was not normal! And for all the best reasons.   Going back? You bet your butts! I may have to run a monthly tab! Love this place, love these folks!   (PS: I read several reviews that mention that they run out of stuff. They do. They will. Chef Cynt runs fresh food rather than just churning out tons of food. It's a risky business model because you may cheese off a customer or two, but that's how it is at ERD and you should go ahead and expect that maybe you will have to change you order a bit. They sell out that amazing chicken like mad! Change your order to fish or shrimp or baked or whathaveyou. Roll with the tide and you may find a new favorite!",

    "text": "I visited back in April and wrote the review in my phone while I was dining but never posted it, so here it goes:  This was my first trip here for a meal. They were out of meats with the exception of shrimp, flounder and catfish. So no chicken, pork chops, etc. Many of the sides were sold out. Apparently this was due to Easter and a brunch they had earlier in the day which is not a normal occurrence. I have to say it was a bit disappointing to not have those options at a soul food restaurant.. I went in at 5 and they close at 8. Makes me wonder what they'd even be able to offer as the evening progressed. I have never been in this area but the restaurant was easy to find with GPS.  Honestly, I wanted to love it but didn't. In my opinion, my fish had a frozen taste and the yams seemed like they were canned. I wanted to share my first experience but also intend to go back. Maybe I just caught them on a bad day.   On another note, you can call ahead for food that you won't pick up until later to not risk missing out on whatever it is you would like to eat.  That's what I was told by the young man that works there since what I wanted was not available. I will say however that I got a little extra fish on my plate because they were out of chicken. The staff was extremely friendly.   ERD has a 99.5 sanitation rating at the time of my visit.   Location: Next to AGR Merchants Group and across the street from PRAXAIR Surface Technologies",

    "text": "I have to first say that it has been over a week since my experience here. I waited to write this review because I didn't want my emotions to control the direction of this. A yelper friend of mine gave this place a great review so I felt confident that I would not be let down. I REALLY was hoping to have a wonderful experience and although it was not what I was expecting I MIGHT give them another chance. I went on a Sunday which I will NEVER do again. But let me start with a positive- Staff: VERY friendly and attentive. That is a plus for me and the only reason I will consider giving them another chance. The negative is I waited OVER an HOUR to get my to go order. When it was finally ready, I was advised that they threw an extra chicken wing in for my wait...seriously?  Well the problem with that is that the wings were pre cooked so they were not very good anyway. I also ordered fried shrimp, macaroni and cheese and candied yams. The shrimp were mediocre, also did not seem freshly fried either. They were a bit salty and fishy flavored for my taste. So I'm wondering what took an hour? Fresh chicken wings take 20 minutes max. Fresh shrimp even less time than that.  The yams were ok. The macaroni and cheese was GREAT. Perhaps I should have just gotten macaroni and cheese. Nevertheless like I said I MIGHT try them again.  Tip for the owners: if you want to throw something in, make it something that is worthwhile like a dessert or a voucher to come back for a free side or something. It would have made waiting an hour less painful.",

    "text": "Had excellent service here at ERD.  I ordered the fried chicken (there were out of dark meat and had to serve wingettes instead), macaroni and cheese, green beans and a blueberry lemonade.  The chicken was seasoned well enough, although it could've had a crispier skin. Mac and cheese was good but a bit over salted. Green beans were good, kinda hard to mess those up. I really enjoyed the blueberry lemonade, but for $3.00, I expected a bigger cup.   All in all, a solid 3.  I would return to try other dishes.",
