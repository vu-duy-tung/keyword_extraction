I enjoyed some great wine with outstanding service.  Out waiter was patient and friendly he gave us some great recommendations and we really enjoyed our food. The menu has lots to offer from traditional Spanish tapas to paella.  Next time I am going to try one of their paella's they take about 35 minutes to make since they are made to order they all sounded fantastic.  There is a great selection of spanish meats and cheeses as well as several grilled octopus dishes.  This place is truly unique I can't wait to go back.",

I love how small it is inside, it goes with the small plates and gives a more personalized feel, and if it is nice ouside please sit on their patio, the music from the Hearst area is always different and talk about a date night spot, this is it.

    "text": "We've walked by Malabar, the red-roofed Spanish tapas restaurant on Tryon, many nights and have always wanted to try it out.  This past Saturday, we finally decided to make reservations and stop in for a late supper.  We were easily able to hold a place for 5 on Open Table (props to the Yelp app for making that so simple) and were pleasantly surprised that Charlotte Restaurant Week began the night before.   One of the most obvious and notable characteristics of Malabar is the authenticity they are striving to achieve with the Spanish tapas experience...to the point that the menus had to be explained to us more than one time.  Now I didn't view this as a negative.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable of the items served on the menu and made excellent recommendations, both on food and wine.  They brought out fresh bread with high quality olive oil for dipping before the first course began.   During the menu de-brief, our server explained that the Restaurant Week menu featured 2 small tapas plates, 1 entree, and 1 dessert.  The only difference he pointed out between that and the normal menu was the portion sizes, of course the Restaurant Week menu's would be smaller due to the amount included in the overall meal.  I went for the Vaca Frita (slow cooked beef that is slightly fried for crispness with caramelized onions) and the Champinones (sauteed wild mushrooms) for the first course.  Both of these were recommended by our server and turned out to be absolutely delicious.  The serving of mushrooms was so large the entire table each had some with their tapas choices.  Everyone around the table was also extremely satisfied with their choices, from the Canelones (rolled pasta with chicken and covered in cheese) to the Pulpo (grilled octopus with olives).  By the time we finished the first round, no one was quite sure how we would begin to finish the 2nd, much less the desserts.   I was completely shocked by the portion brought out for our entree.  I ordered the Gambas al Ajo (sauteed garlic shrimp) and they were probably some of the largest shrimp I've ever seen...and there were 5 of them.  Plus potatoes with chili powder on them...with 2 types of sauces.  There was so much food I had 2 shrimp left over.  I tried to pass them off to my fellow diners but they were just as full from their entrees.  Two others ordered the Churrasco (grilled skirt steak with Chimichurri) and also raved about how delicious everything came out.    Throw in the red sangria and multiple glasses of Spanish red wine that we had with our huge meal and everyone was ready to go to bed.  And then...the dessert came out.  I ordered the Cafe Chocolate.  Man o man. It was absurdly delicious.  I could've eaten an entire tub of that for dinner and been equally happy with the experience.  In a glass there was a layer of chocolate mousse, topped with a layer of coffee mousse, and topped with these lovely dark chocolate curls.  It was to die for. Incredibly delicious. I cannot rave enough about that dessert. It was obscene. Stop what you are doing and go right now to get one. You will thank me later.   Overall, the food at Malabar was absolutely excellent.  The only reason I did not award 5 stars was due to the amount of time it took for each round of food to come out.  I'm sure this was just a classic Saturday night in Uptown, but by the time checks were signed and we were ready to go the entire evening took over 2 and a half hours.    Despite the somewhat slow dinner experience, Malabar is an absolute must try next time you dine out in Charlotte.  Take the recommendations from the servers (they know what they are talking about) and don't you dare leave without trying the Cafe Chocolate....so good.",

The rice was very well cooked (fluffy) but entirely lacked seasoning. The paella only had shrimp (as opposed to a mix of seafood). The sandwiches heavily favored bread in their bread to meat ratio. The papas bravas were average - the potatoes had obviously been reheated and the aioli was WAY too garlicky (not balanced). The tiramisu was the highlight of my meal, but on par with what you could get at the grocery store. The churros were over cooked and biscotti texture, just oily. I went with a group of 11 and approximately 4 in the group would go back.",

My BF and I arrived & the host immediately asked if we had reservations, we did not, but she sat us anyway with ONE menu, promising she'd bring a 2nd one when it became avail. The restaurant was full when we sat down, maybe about 4 open tables.  About 2 min later a bus lady came and filled our water in silence.... That was it... For about 10 min. I looked at my watch and I tell the BF \"If we have to wait 10 more min. we are walking out.\" 5 minutes later, the bus lady brings out bread & fills our water.. Again in COMPLETE silence.   At this point, no one has said a word to us, not even a \"Hey someone will be right with you.\"  But by this time, half the restaurant was gone and 4 new tables sat. No one brings our 2nd menu, and there is one server that keeps looking at us but continues to walk right by us and says nothing.   15 minutes have passed from the time the bus lady brought bread which my BF has almost finished, he looks at me and says \"ready?\" I grab my purse when the same host finally comes up and plainly says \"Do you know what you want to drink?\" At this point my blood started to boil.   Not a \"sorry you've been waiting 25 min.\" Not a \"Hey! Hope the bread was ok, we've been swamped.\" Nope. NOTHING.   I look at her and say -  \"You know we have been sitting here more than 25 minutes and no one has said a word to us.\" She stops and thinks for 2 seconds & replies with \"we are short staffed today and are doing the best we can.\"  Me- \"I totally get that, but that's no reason not to even acknowledge someone is sitting here.\" I tell her I've been a server over 7 years & what she just said was no excuse. And finish with \"I think we are going to go.\" The BF grabs the last piece of bread as we get up (I thought it was quite funny!!) and we walk out.   I wanted so badly to like this place... But I will NEVER be back here. I've been in the restaurant industry 7 years and I know what being busy is and how EASY it is to acknowledge someone. Because of that I always tip well, even when I have shitty service. But there was no way I'd spend my money here. Neither should you.",

    "text": "Had a business meeting today uptown and both of us had been dying to try out Malabar, so we decided to talk over lunch! We arrived pretty early, at 11:45am, and were the only ones in the restaurant for the first 30 minutes.  Everything from the atmosphere to the service and the food to the prices was right on point. The two of us decided to skip the entrees and just order several tapas so we could try more of the items on the menu, and as far as I'm concerned, this is the only way to go at a Tapas/Small Plates restaurant.   We ordered the ham and manchego croquetas, pan con tomate (tomato bread), tortilla Espanola, and Pimentones Rellenos (stuffed peppers). Everything was delicious, but the croquetas and tomato bread were the real highlights. The croquetas were rich yet light and fluffy and just melted in your mouth, we ended up ordering a second helping after we finished all of our food! The tomato bread is a Spanish mystery to me, to be able to take 3 such simple ingredients (bread, tomatoes, and olive oil) and combine them into something so incredibly flavorful and delicious takes real skill and very high quality ingredients.   We ended up ordering 5 tapas (plus the free bread and olive oil that they bring to each table) and it was more than enough food for two people. We were shocked when our bill came out to $23; definitely can't do much better than that for a lunch of this caliber uptown!  I will 100% visit Malabar again to try out the rest of their tapas and some of their desserts!",

    "text": "Visited Malabar today to try their tapas selection and was pleased overall with everything. We had a reservation and arrived early so it wasn't too crowded at the beginning, but the small seating area filled up as the evening went on!  The food overall was solid with some dishes that were excellent and some that were just okay. My date and I tried six items total. -Clams: the clams themselves were okay and the broth was very flavorful; the chorizo in the broth was the real star here though surprisingly and was outstanding! -Stuffed peppers: the peppers were delicious and filled with a delicious cheese and rice mixture; highly recommended especially for vegetarians.  -Lamb chops: very strong lemon flavor, not bad overall but 3 chops not worth the $17 price -Beef Empanadas: crispy coating and pretty flavorful beef filling. They were a solid option but only getting 2 to an order I would recommend trying other choices instead -Croquetas: AMAZING! The ham, cheese and potato filling is ridiculously good and these were definitely the favorite item. -Tres leches cake: we didn't order this but one of the servers brought it out to us FOR FREE just for coming in and ordering food.   Overall the food was good and the service was outstanding! Our waters were constantly refilled and the food came out pretty quickly. The free cake we received was just a bonus of the impeccable service here. The prices are a little high for the portions (as with all tapas places in my opinion) but I'd highly recommend Malabar if you're looking to try a tapas experience in Charlotte.",

When we have eaten tapas in the past (at many different restaurants) the server or host host has spent time going over the menu. Suggested pairings and explained dishes.   Last night at Malabar we were on our own. No friendly chit chat, no menu assistance. Frankly we did not know who our server was. One took out drink order another took the order and yet another brought the food.   No one asked if we wanted a second round of drinks (we did). No one asked how the food was prepared (competently but not great - don't get the scallops - grossly over cooked) and we were rushed out.",

I am not sure if this was because of restaurant week or what. The conejo was ok as well. The gambas were great. I would go back for the tapas (especially the  grilled calamari).",

    "text": "I occassionally go to malabar because i love spanish tapas and there arent many options for that in charlotte. however, i dont think i can quite put it in four star territory both because ive had higher quality tapas in other cities and because of some customer service issues.   i think it is best to go to Malabar at lunchtime. You save money this way and although the food is good, its not good enough to pay big money for. Save the big money for tapas places in larger cities (The Iberian Pig in Atlanta and Amada in Philly come to mind). Also, the best item on Malabar's menu is only served at lunch-the torta sandwich. It has albondigas,avocado, manchego cheese, and a spicy paprika sauce on it and the combination of these ingredients is amazing. the papas braves that come on the side are fantastic as well especially with the aforementioned paparika sauce. The various cured meats are usually very good and are on both the lunch and dinner menu.   On the dinner menu, there are both tapas and larger entrees but I would urge people to stay away from the entrees because theyre priced a bit unfairly. The name 'entree' is very misleading. Many of their entrees arent much bigger than the small plate options yet cost at least twice as much!   Unfortunately, Ive had some bad experiences with customer service at Malabar. When i went a few days ago, my server was very rude and couldnt answer even basic questions about the menu. Two of the cheeses on their cheese plate werent familiar to me so I asked him about what sort of cheeses they were. He looked at me as if I was a complete idiot and said 'uh cheese. what do you mean what kind of cheeses?\". Im sorry but thats just inexcusable. If you work at a Spanish tapas place, you should be able to give a brief description of the cheeses since thats a pretty important part of the tapas experience! Even though he couldnt tell me much about the cheeses, I took the risk and ordered the cheese plate anyway. Two of the cheeses were good, one tasted like plastic. The service also tends to be slow.  The bottom line: This place works to satisfy my fix when Im craving tapas but if Charlotte had more tapas options, it likely wouldnt be at the top of my list",

    "text": "Tapas, nothing less!  I always enjoy going to tapas restaurants because given the miniscule size of each dish, chefs tend to go the extra mile to make the food stand out. In many ways, these Spanish style dishes are among the most powerful because you can clearly taste the flavors that are baked, grilled or fried right into the main protein or ingredient (smaller serving dishes implies more concentrated flavors).  Malabar has a few great instances of this, namely their Paella and Croquetas. Paella takes ~35 min to make, but if you're looking for something fresh, this is the only place that's going to do it for you in uptown. A fresh paella takes awhile and when you receive the finished product (photo), you'll understand why. I tried the Paella Royale, which came with a wide assortment of fish, chorizo and chicken. It was a generous portion and very very delicious. The waiters claim this is what they eat back home, but obviously take that with a grain of salt (no pun). The croquetas are rich, velvety and savory. Nice flecks of jamon serrano.   The Vaca Frita was somewhat average to me. It definitely sounded amazing and used two ingredients that I love together: beef and onions...then they fry it. The actual product was a little tougher than I would have liked and a little under seasoned - but I won't hold it against them.   All in all, if you've had really good Spanish/Tapas before, then you're probably not going to be too impressed here, though it will be enjoyable. For newcomers, this is a great place to start developing your tapas palate.  4/5",

    "text": "Came here on Saturday evening with my husband and a friend. We had reservations for 8pm.   This place is soooo tiny but a great atmosphere in side! Our table wasn't ready yet, but they gave us complimentary glasses of sangria while we waited.   Once we sat down, we ordered the pitcher of sangria, which was about two glasses of sangria for each of us.   We decided to stick with all tapas for the night and ordered 6 different tapas (We ordered them two at a time so they came out in intervals). Probably could have done with only 5 because we were all crazy full at the end of it all. Note: you receive olive oil and dipping bread complimentary. -Croquettas- I read online that these were delish....didnt let us down! The order came with 3, so we each got one.....Though, arguably I could have eaten 20!!! Warm, ham-cheese-potato mix inside! These may have been the highlight of the night. -Pan de Tomate- The serving for this was 4 pieces of bread with a tomato spread on top. We probably could have skipped this....it was good but nothing amazing. -Stuffed Peppers- These were stuffed red peppers. Not sure what the filling inside was but I know it was in the vegetarian section of the menu. Very good and I recommend. There were 3 peppers. -Chorizo with onions- This was my friend and husband's favorite dish. Super caramalized onions with perfectly cooked slices of chorizo. Very good. There was plenty for the three of us. -Eggplant Bruschetta-  Very good.....super garlicy! There were either 3 or 4 of these....keep in mind I was 3 glasses of sangria in (plus the cosmo from earlier!!!)! -Clams in red sauce- Perfect end. The claims were cooked perfectly. We actually kept taking the bread from the table and dipping it in the sauce because it was that good. This portion size was very large for tapas.   Will absolutely return. Great food and good atmosphere. Just make a reservation because it isn't a large venue",

I figured the baby green salad was the same salad on the regular menu also called baby green salad that had goat cheese, almonds, and tomatoes, but it wasn't. It was just lettuce and light dressing. Service was pretty slow around 1:00. We were the only table in there. The staff definitely outnumbered the guests. I think the manager ended up taking over since the server was M.I.A.

    "text": "I chose to dine at Malabar on our last night here in Charlotte. I trusted the reviews and decided to give this place a shot. First off, let me start by saying that the service is bare minimum and our waitress barely spoke english. The complimentary bread that was given to us was not warm and neither was it fresh. It honestly tasted like I was eating 5 day old baguette with olive oil. As we were browsing through the menu, we realized that the paella had some fine print to it ( a minimum order of 2 ), $18 dollars per pax. Why would you state that pricing on your menu if it is basically required to order 2 portions, and of the same flavor? It almost seems like a scheme trying to make you order the Paella for $36.   Since we were in the mood for some paella anyway, we decided to order 2 portions of the Paella de Pescado. Wow. I'm no paella connoisseur, but this was by far the worst paella I have ever had. The only thing I'll at least credit them for is the generosity of seafood. There were at least 8 clams, 8 mussels, 2 huge shrimps along with many other seafoods. However, the seafood wasn't fresh and all I tasted was literally the sea. The sangria that I ordered was fine but the presentation could be improved. A solid 3/5 stars for that. At the end of our meal, we were given a complimentary chocolate mousse cake. That was nice surprise but I was really expecting better food at a restaurant with such a great reputation. An absolute let down.",

They were all flavorful, fresh, and well made.   They offer a fair amount of vegetarian dishes too and one of my faves was this potato dish in a tomato marinate. Soooo good I can still taste it.   For dessert I ordered the flan, and I really looooove flan. This one was good but I've had better flan. Overall good food, good service but nothing too special in my opinion.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Malabar more. I've had my eye on the place since it opened (I used to love Coco Osteria), but I never managed to make it there til Saturday night. The fella and I decided to go for dinner and made reservations for 6:30. As others have noted, it's a pretty small place, so reservations are highly recommended.  I usually don't like such cramped quarters because I feel like everyone around me is listening to my conversation, but at Malabar, the music and people are so lively that I didn't mind at all. Our service was impeccable.  So, why only 3 stars? The food. Sigh. We made it a night of tapas and tried the croquetas (ham, potato), albondigas (beet meatballs in tomato sauce), vaca frita (crispy beef with pickled onion on top), and romesco (eggplant bruschetta). While it was all fine, it was all just fine. Nothing stood out, nothing had much spice... it was all just, well, fine. I had hoped that out of four tapas, surely one of them would be delicious! But no. I also got the sangria after reading other reviews of how good it was; it was good, but can you really mess up sangria OR make it super great? It was fine, too.  We did try the tres leches cake for dessert (after asking out waitress to pick between that and the churros), and it was good - small but the perfect size for not gorging, moist, and creamy.  Thankfully, the atmosphere and service made up for the food, but I don't think we'll make it a point to stop by Malabar again.",

The dinner menu includes a nice selection of meat-, veggie- and fish-based tapas dishes, as well as paella (allow ~30 minutes for these gems) and desserts (hello, tres leches cake). I've found that three to five dishes comprise a filling meal for two. The croquetas, pimientos rellenos and tortilla de esparragos have been standouts for me, and the seafood paella beckons for when I return. The list of Spanish wines has a good number of by-the-glass options, with some bottle options being reasonably priced. Specialty cocktails also are for the sipping. (Caipirinha? Siiii.)  On each of my visits I've been greeted warmly at the door by the host/manager and seated in the cozy-chic, low-lit dining room. Patio seating is great when the weather cooperates. The staff is friendly and super-quick in my experience. On one visit we let our server take the wheel and select our dishes; we weren't disappointed.

Before I got there my friend ordered me a cosmo, took a while to get there for only have 3 customers.  It tasted okay so that is the 2 stars.  My friends sangria was disgusting and was spiced with something awful, they did not charge us for it.  He then went to look over the wine list, as the manager just stood there and stared at him waiting for his reply.  Super uncomfortable, it wasn't like we were in a rush!  We ordered the cod fritters and 2 cheeses to start.  I didn't care for any of it, the presentation was bad and the flavor was worse.  We figured we were in for a night of disappointments if we stayed, so we opted to pay the check and head somewhere else.  I was really hoping for some great Spanish tapas since they are few and far between here.  But it just was bad and awkward and made me question how the same people who own and run Luce could possibly be involved with this place.",

We're big fans of tapas so we couldn't resist checking out this spot just a few blocks from our Uptown hotel.  Had a reservation, so we were seated promptly upon arrival.  The space is small but cozy and well appointed.  It can be a tight squeeze with the servers moving around, but we weren't bothered by it, as we were situated in a corner.  We ordered up everything at once for our table, sharing a cheese plate, cured meat board, Canelones, Empanadas, Patatas Bravas, and then finishing off with a meat paella.  On the whole, we found the food to be good, but not great.  Didn't care for the presentation of the patatas bravas, with the sauces served on the side rather than being integrated into the dish.  The rest of the dishes were fine, but without the depth of flavor I've come to expect at other Spanish tapas spots I've visited.  Service was marginal at best.  Our server provided pretty curt responses to our inquiries about the menu; it almost seemed like we were somewhat of an inconvenience by coming out for dinner that evening.  I was particularly disappointed in the staff's inability to explain more about the dishes we ordered, especially when it came to the meat and cheese plates.  The staff was unable to give us any insights on the cheeses or meats, such as where they came from and the flavor characteristics of the cheese.  We ordered some churros for dessert, which took nearly 25 minutes to arrive at the table, leading me to believe that our order was forgotten somewhere along the way.  The tapas game in Charlotte is not strong, so Malabar may satisfy your cravings if you're jonesing for a few traditional Spanish dishes.  However, should another Spanish tapas spot open up, I feel like the competition would be pretty stiff without having to try too hard.",

Took and incredible amount of time to get drinks and appetizers (30 plus minutes for apps ) . Appetizer were delicious ( tried 6 different things at table, all were great).  But nothing came out to the right person which is noted in another review also.  Dinner took another 45 minutes after this to come out- horrible . Ordered the skirt steak....extremely fatty and un enjoyable . I pushed this aside it was so bad.   To make matters worse it was another 25 minutes after we had to remind our server of desserts. I was ready to just forget the dessert and get my check. The checkout was a disaster.   Two wrong charges posted to my debit card the following day which totaled almost 400 dollars of WRONG charges. This is on top of drinks that were not mine being incorrectly added to my bill. What a nightmare to resolve....when I attempted to resolve I was told that they would \" do me a favor this time\" and refund the alcohol charges for the drinks that were incorrectly added. I don't even drink alcohol, only had water during this visit. Still waiting for the money to be returned as of 48 hrs later and multiple follow ups with restaurant.   This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant  and its a shame because the place looks like it could be great ( nice location, nice ambiance, unique menu) .  Would never return",

A couple of clicks and I had a table for 2 reserved for Tuesday, July 5th at 7:45pm. Arrived at 7:35pm and greeted with a sign in the window that said the restaurant was closed on July 5th and to visit their sister restaurant. Not that we went hungry given the choices downtown Charlotte, but missed the opportunity to get a reservation at another restaurant we were going to try.  Not sure whether the blame here lies with Malabar or Yelp, but I presume with an electronic reservation system you can indicate days on which the restaurant is closed.",

On a white dinner plate, no garnishment, just the beef with nothing.  Presentation was a zero, and it was not seasoned, just tasted like fried meat. Could have been skirt steak or any cut of beef, tasted blah. Had Pulpo, served sliced into pieces, no tentacles, again not what one expects at a tapas place.   We also ordered Gambas. Supposed to be grilled shrimp, like the ones with tails on them. We got a bowl if the tiny bay shrimp which in a grocery store is $1.99 a pound. Never in a million years would any Tapas restaurant served these as Gambas. $15 for that dish!  Spent  $100, left hungry. We do Tapas all over including Barcelona (visiting from out of town here in CLT) this was not a great experience.",

I sit at the bar when I am alone so that I can hopefully have a conversation with someone, like the bartender, but everyone who worked there was huddling in the corner chatting with each other when they weren't taking care of their customers.

    "text": "Malabar is a tremendous let down for anyone who has experienced good service. The menu is interesting enough and the food perfectly acceptable, but my companion and I never said \"this is good\" more than once and certainly will not be adding the restaurant to our regular list.   I made a reservation via Yelp for New Year's Eve. We were seated promptly but waited for 15 minutes or more before -- long enough that we began looking for a server -- as no one indicated that he or she was our server or had even come to take our drink orders. As some others have indicated our bread tasted stale instead of appropriately chewy and crunchy. Once I finally made eye contact with a man behind the bar, he came over and seemed nervous rather than welcoming. I ordered a half carafe of wine, and since we had been waiting so long indicated we wanted to order our meal as well. There was no apology for the delay, and the server seemed disinterested in providing any real service other than jotting down our six tapas. I stated that the orders could be brought out as the kitchen recommended.   Each dish arrived in sets of twos. They were placed on the table with no words, no inquiry as to how we were enjoying the meal and if we needed anything else. Again the food was good -- not great -- which made me sad because I had wanted a lovely experience for my companion who hasn't had the joy of eating at some of the amazing places I have. How I wish I'd chosen somewhere else!   We ordered flan and tres leches for dessert. The presentation on the tres leches was tacky -- a bowl with a canned spiral of whipped cream and a cherry.   The check was settled quickly, and I felt remiss to even leave a tip.   I imagine Malabar stays open due to its location and reasonable prices, but it is hardly a dining destination.",

There isn't a True waiting area except for the entry way and as people started to come in behind us we had truly no where to go. Not even really sure if this place even has a host... Eventually we caught the attention of who I think may have been a bartender/waiter/possibly host to let him know we were waiting for a table and is if we were bothering him told us someone would eventually get to us. At this point the 2 couples who had walked in after us said \"there's tons of restaurant's around here let's find another one!\" and literally walked out. Having driven around for almost 30 min looking for one on the other side and having already waited almost 1/2 an hour on a day when most businesses had closed to show solidarity for Immigrant workers. I'm not going to lie I was starving and feeling kind of vested to see this experience through. The place was extremely crowded but eventually we were seated. We had croquetas, mussels, the stuffed ravioli and eggs with ham & fries which were super tasty. Price point was fairly inexpensive with nothing over $20 on the menu. Quite honestly I would have given this place 5 stars had the customer service not been lacking so. Wish everyone knew you only get one chance to make a first impression.",

    "text": "We came here on a Friday evening and were pretty disappointed in the food. Spanish cuisine is our absolute favorite and we had high hopes and expectations for this restaurant. However, they were not met and the three stars I'm giving are for the good service. To start, my sangria was very watered down. Not a big issue, but at $8 a glass, they could've put a little more wine and less ice.  For tapas, we ordered the stuffed peppers, shrimp, churrasco, and empanadas. The stuffed peppers were decent and the churrasco was tender and delicious. However, the remaining plates were not up to standard. The shrimp we were served were tiny and tasted incredibly fishy. Definitely not fresh. I've had this specific plate in various other Spanish restaurants and was really excited when I ordered it. We ended up leaving the entire plate practically untouched, in fear of food poisoning. As for the empanadas, the pastry was crisp and yummy but the filling ruined the dish. The meat was way too sweet and it left a bad aftertaste. We honestly could have overlooked the two downright horrible tapas plates if it weren't for the disappointing desserts that followed. I ordered churros and my boyfriend ordered the creme catalan. My churros arrived cold, and the chocolate sauce  they were served with was goopy. This made it impossible to dip the churros into the chocolate. I had to practically scoop it up with a fork. My boyfriend's creme catalan was mediocre and lacked flavor (We've actually visited this restaurant once prior for desserts and coffee and had a much better experience, so it's possible that this time was just a bad night for them). Also, the espresso machine was broken, so we were only able to order regular coffee. A cappuccino certainly would have put me in a better mood!  Overall, although the service was good and the ambience was romantic, the food failed to impress. We paid $130 and left hungry and unsatisfied so we probably won't be coming here again, at least anytime soon.",

I threw back a couple of the Brazilian beers and then switched to Sangria to be a little more in the Spanish mood.  I started with the mussels.  I had a ton of mussels in Belgium so I was excited to give Spanish mussels a try.  They were great.  I had the chicken as my main dish pretty much because everyone else got the steak with chimichurri and I wanted to have something to barter.  Both the steak and chicken were good.  For dessert my group made an even split between tres leches and the chocolate mousse.  Both were excellent.  The service was right on the whole evening clearing plates promptly and keeping our beverages refreshed.    The restaurant is quite small so I would strongly suggest having a reservation.

    "text": "I ventured to this cozy little establishment to meet a visiting friend for a catch up dinner. As per usual I was chronically early for our 7pm reservation but the host was kind enough to seat me at one of the many open tables early. He even asked if I had a preference, which was an appreciated touch.   During my wait for my friend someone came to fill our water glasses and ordered a glass of wine (sorry folks no Wednesday night drink specials - which surprised me). I did not see my usual pinot noir on the menu so I selected a syrah which was a decent substitution.   When my friend arrived and we were ready to order we selected Pimientos Rellenos (stuffed roasted peppers) and Pulpo (octopus) to share and she also got a salad. Both were delicious and hearty enough that I felt full just splitting the two options. They also brought bread which was okay. The bread was the only strange part of the experience - they waited until my dining companion arrived to serve it even though it didn't come out warm. I would have appreciated the snack while I reviewed the menu but perhaps they only give out one per table and didn't want me to hog it all before my companion arrived?  This quiet intimate restaurant looks like a great place for date night and I will happily return to try more of their menu.",

There was a 30 minute wait when we arrived with no reservation, but we sat at the little bar and had coconut mojitos and chatted - no worries... then we were seated on time at a nice table. What i love about this location is that you are in Uptown and you can see Uptown - you can people watch and enjoy the city atmosphere from inside.  I have reviewed this place for lunch and gave it 4 stars - now i am reviewing it for dinner and its up to 5. I really love this little spot (and yes, it is little). It's so cozy though. The entire staff is very Spanish and they play Spanish music and have amazing Spanish Tapas...  I love the patatas bravas, Croquetas, Churrasco, the meat platter oh and my favorite from lunch is the same at dinner Gambas al Ajo. (Garlicy Shrimp )  Really good cappuccinos for after dinner, a great coconut mojito for pre-dinner and really yummy flan and empanadas... YUM YUM YUM...  How do you say YUM in Spanish???",

I also think they do 1/2 priced bottles of wine on some nights--can't beat that!!!!!",

I am not sure if there is new management, a new chef or just a menu change, but the restaurant is no longer the Malabar we knew and loved. The menu is a major departure from traditional Spanish food. The tapas were extremely bland or incorrectly seasoned based on the dish. The patatas bravas are now just French fries- very floral seasoned ones at that. Very disappointing experience.",

We dined recently with another couple and after waiting a few minutes for our table were welcomed with water/ bread with olive oil. While the menu sounded delicious the food came out super quickly - dessert before my husband had finished his entree for example.  We loved our visit to Curate in Asheville, and this meal couldn't have been more different.   Nothing was stand out good or bad. Everything felt like it was pre-portioned (a little small) and waiting for the next restaurant week guest to order. I like to use restaurant week to find new favorite spots for our dining out rotation and Malabar didn't pass this litmus test. So many places do restaurant week well and if you aren't interested in providing the same level of quality during this time, then opt out.",

    "text": "We had a wonderful experience at Malabar.  We decided to visit Malabar before heading next door to the Blumenthal.  It's literally a 2-minute walk to the Blumenthal entrance.  We arrived at 6:15 pm for a 6:15 pm reservation.  There were two other 6:15 reservations ahead of us, and we ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated.  No worries, it was a Saturday night, and the place was really busy.  The place is small and intimate.  It is well decorated, cozy.  The tables are kind of close to one another, but I think it adds to the experience making it a nice, social atmosphere.  Great for tapas-style eating.  Upon being seated, we were greeted quickly and placed drink orders.  The wine was served quickly and we placed our initial food order a few minutes later.  We started with the croquetas, stuffed peppers, and artichokes with lemon.  They were all wonderful, but the croquetas were out of this world.  They came out warm, crisp and stuffed with ham and cheese.  We wound up ordering two more later in the meal.  The stuffed peppers were really nice.  I could take or leave the artichokes, but they were nicely prepared.  I'm not a huge artichoke lover, but wanted to try them so we weren't just ordering meats.  The second round of ordering, we had steak empanadas, vegetable and chicken kabobs, more croquetas, and a potato omelet.  The empanadas were excellent.  The crust was flaky and the carnitas inside were perfectly seasoned and tender.  The potato omelet was also great; light and fluffy eggs with tender potatos.  It was very filling.  The veggie and chicken kabobs were nice, with the grilled chicken having the best flavor.  We were ready for the check when we were surprised with the coconut gelato given to us on the house.  It was so delicious!  The coconut flavor was the perfect ending to our meal at Malabars.",

The food is generally fine and the menu akin to traditional tapas. The meat dishes have generally been enjoyable and I do like the variety of dishes and specials on their menu. However, I would not recommend the mussels at all, they did not taste fresh and were definitely veering towards questionable territory. The meatballs have also been fairly bland and lukewarm. The kicker in our last experience was dessert. This was the first dessert I had ordered at Malabar and we went with one tres leches for three people. We didn't finish it and the tres leches enthusiast at the table sincerely thought that we had been served the wrong dish initially. We truly wanted to send it back, but didn't want to seem difficult or have an extended conversation about it so we settled for finishing the coffee and paying.   That being said, the ambiance is rather fun. The close together tables and hectic tapas atmosphere lead to a buzzy feeling when Malabar is full. Staff have always been helpful and courteous. I am hoping to give Malabar another chance, but will not be doing so with out of town guests.",

The beef empanadas were fantastic! Very very flavorful! The clams were so-so. I definitely enjoyed the spinach, which had a very unique flavor, and you must cap off your dinner with a dessert. I had the Crema Catalina (I think that was what it is called) which was very similar to a creme brulee but with the cinnamon taste.  The staff was wonderful, with many of them coming from Europe which lends to an authenticity most Tapas places don't. I wish this place were in my town!",

There were several large parties at the restaurant and they seemed to be sucking the wait and cook staff away from attending to us. It took at least 10 minutes for someone to take a drink order, although the support staff filled our water very regularly and were easily the most attentive staff there.  Beyond the service, the Spanish tapas were disappointingly mediocre. Having lived in Spain previously, I was really hoping to find a high quality tapas restaurant in Charlotte and thought the food was very average and definitely overpriced. The pimientos rellenos were the only truly outstanding dish out of the twelve we tried. The classic tapas like croquetas and patatas bravas were fine but nothing great. DO NOT order the espinaca catalana - very disappointing.  I will say that my group of six each ordered two tapas and had plenty of food to go around. I enjoy the sharing style and it worked well at Malabar. We were all quite full at the end, I just did not feel like the quality matched the price here.",

    "text": "Malabar is a great option for dining in downtown Charlotte.  We all hear the word \"tapas\" thrown around these days to pretty much describe any place that features small plates.  But Malabar truly offers tapas, True Spanish tapas.    I tried to make a reservation for Malabar online but there were absolutely no reservations open for my planned Saturday night dinner.  However I called Malabar and had no problems making a 7pm reservation.    The restaurant was very full and running on a wait but we were greeted warmly and immediately.  We were seated very soon after our reservation time.    For a cocktail I tried their red sangria which was very good.  They also have a white sangria option.  For tapas, my friend and I ordered several different tapas.  Our favorite tapas were the Pulpo (octopus) and the vegetarian Pimientos Rellenos.  The only thing we tried that truly disappointed us was the flan.  I have had flan many times and it is one of my favorite desserts.  But our flan was almost inedible.  The sauce was very bitter and the custard didn't have the firm yet creamy texture it should.  I'm guessing it was a fluke and hopefully they usually have a good flan.    The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  It's a small space but with a very tall ceiling featuring a large modern chandelier, it feels spacious and elegant.  We had a little confusion with who was our server.  It never felt like we had a dedicated person and everyone appeared kind of in the weeds so it was hard to know who to ask when we wanted to order more tapas, get our bill, et cetera.  Everything on the menu looks amazing.  We were oohing and ahhing at our neighbors' food.  One table had the paella for two and another had empanadas that looked equally delicious.  l will definitely be back to Malabar and look forward to trying more of the tapas and that paella!",

    "text": "Phenomenal....yup that pretty much sums this place up. I am shocked to see some mixed reviews on here for Malabar. I went here last night with a group of friends for restaurant week and I can not say one bad thing about the place. Everything from the service to the food was amazing. The great part about there menu for restaurant week is that you can try out a lot of there foods. They gave a choice of two tapas to start, one entree, and one dessert. As far as the entree you had an option with their Paella. If you chose, it was for your standard two people. My girlfriend and I decided that we wanted to try as many tapas as possible and ordered four different tapas. We  got the grilled octopus, calamari, croquetas, and clams with chorizo. All of them were great. The croquetas, clams, and calamari were out of this world. The grilled octopus was good but not on the same level as the other dishes. The sauce from the clams with chorizo were to die for. I used up all the bread on the table to soak up that stuff. We both wanted the Seafood Paella. It was extremely flavorful and came with a good amount of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari and monk fish. All of the ingredients were perfectly cooked. For dessert we split the flan and the tres leches. I do not a very big sweet tooth but I thought both were really good. The tres leches was super moist.  All of that paired with a nice bottle of Granacha and good friends. Truly a nice evening at Malabar.",

We had the grilled octopus, the stuffed pepers, that both were very good. The patatas bravas were the worst potatoes ever. They were the hardest potatoes to chew. We ate 1/6 of the papatas bravas. We had also one paella. When they brought the paella, we could smell a strong smell of something burned. When we served ourselves we could see also that it was burned. We informed the waiter about it; he said this is normal for a paella and we should try avoid scooping hard the pot. He never offered us the chance to replace it or order something else. We could not eat either the paella, since it was more black-burned rice inside. The waiter saw that we did not eat most of the food. We explained him that it is dangerous to eat burned food-coal. He never apologised, brought us the full check without any discount. He just brought us desserts for free, although we answered to him that we did not want any dessert. Lack of customer management and care is very bad for a restaurant. We would never recommend this place to anyone.",

The Marinated White Anchovies were very fresh and perfect. If you've never tried real, fresh anchovies, you should treat yourself to this. Even the sauteed baby spinach tapas was exemplary.  Prices are very reasonable. Street parking is ample at dinner time or you can park in Hearst Tower for next to nothing after 5. The Sangria could have been stronger, but was still very tasty.",

One of the tapas I had was the asparagus omelet and I cannot get the taste out of my mind - it was that good. One thing I will say, is that I feel like I have already tasted the whole menu for what is available for vegetarians - would be good to have special tapas to get me to come back and try something new!",

No. We do not have rice here. No rice here.\" Really? No rice? Half the menu consists of paella options (cooked to order, 2-person order minimum). I guess he meant to say no rice on the side or something like that, but he was literally barking back to me \"No rice here\" over and over again. Not sure if he was offended somehow by the question, but anyway other than this negative interaction, the kitchen is doing a good job and I had a tasty meal. btw, tres leches dessert hit the spot.",

Anyone who has been to Europe would know what the service is like there but if not I would not recommend this place if the most important thing to you is very attentive service. Things moved a little slower than most resteraunts in the US but it made it seem like a more authentic experience.   However the food was delicious! Several in our group had been to Spain before and was reminded of it with the food. For everyone else the food was just overall really good! I love tapas and they had a very good variety! My favorite by far was the Croquettes, which are basically fried cheese balls with ham, and are so good!   The paella was also well liked in our group but note that is does take at least 35 minutes to make. We had some people in our group not happy about how long it took but it is made fresh and the menu does mention it on top so when it takes a while it should not be a surprise.",

This place blew us away! Our group of 4 ordered around 11-15 tapas and shared them family-style.   Y'all. We had churrasco steak, spicy mussels, grilled octopus, anchovies, sangria, and tres leches.....just to name a few. I can't remember the rest. All of them were delicious. No, I'm serious. The portions were generous, in my opinion......or maybe it's because I ate some many potatoes......anyway, I enjoyed myself greatly and decided that I now need to visit Spain.....like now.  The prices weren't bad at all. Since all four of us shared everything, we decided to split the bill evenly. Y'all. Guess how much I paid (with tip)? $40! For more than 10 different dishes, flavors, and mouth experiences.....that's an an amazing deal. We all left stuffed and extremely satisfied.",

You have the options of potatoes or fried yuca with your entree and I did the yuca - it was great, it was paired with a couple really flavorful sauces too.   The location of Malabar is perfect for the uptown crowd, and they have outside sitting if you're wanting to enjoy the weather.

Both were great examples of fine customer service.  We started with some signature drinks that were lovely. Our appetizer was very fresh calamari. Dinner for me was chorizo, espresso rubbed ribs and tres leches cake. All were great in my opinion. My wife had shrimp ceviche, Mahi mahi and churros for dessert. She enjoyed every bite.  Alberto paired a couple of glasses of wine with our dinner. The perfect compliment. We will definitely be back when the temperatures rise to have the signature sangria and paella. Well done malabar",

I ordered ala cart, starting with the tablas mixtas- Traditional Spanish meats and cheeses. I especially love manchego . The dish paired well with my wine and the delicious table bread. Our waiter was nice, too. We didn't get any suggestions, so I just  started ordering things that sounded good. I ordered a malbec (Chilean) with my first course then ordered some tapas. I will be back to share an order of the sangria pitcher ($20). Note: This is a traditional Spanish restaurant, so the dinner plates are small. I ordered the spinach and 2 croquetas. Although I planned to order at least another tapa, I was so full! Next time I would like to order the paella to share. They had a lot of dishes that I thought would be unusual to Spain, like ceviche and pasteles tres leches, but everything else did remind me of my trip to Barcelona. My friend had churros as a part of her dessert. She shared with me, and I ordered another a glass of wine. By now, the waiter had become very friendly with us and made sure I had a generous pour. Dessert was excellent. Both of us were very satisfied and plan to return FREQUENTLY. Since there were so many tapas options, this would be especially fun for a date night or to share with a large group of friends.",

I've been here a few times and there are a lot of good things in the menu. The chiles rellenos (stuffed peppers), croquettes, churrasco (skirt steak), and the crispy beef dishes are some of my favorites. The empanadas and garlic shrimp are also very good. This time they had a chorizo special that I was really disappointed by. I'm used to it being juicy and flavorful, but it was a link and very dry.   The service is really good. They are attentive and food comes out as it is ready. They take reservations, but there's usually not a wait when I'm there. It's a pretty small, cute little place. Being tapas style, the price can start to add up, but it's worth it for a special occasion.   This is a great place to go for dinner before a play or show. It's less than a block away from Belk Theater. If you're in the area, I would recommend checking it out!",

    "text": "It's quite a challenge to review Malabar... the restaurant seems to be trapped between its current Spanish incarnation and its former self as Coco Osteria. Killer location on Tryon Street in front of the Hearst Tower, and they have outdoor seating as well. Great ambience too; I really wanted this place to be spectacular, and they're trying, but still seem to be working out the kinks. The manager is very friendly and did his best to accommodate our party of three quickly before Opera Carolina, but the first two wines we ordered- Spanish, naturally- couldn't be found and seemed to cause some confusion; apparently the wine list is still in flux and everything isn't stocked yet. He finally brought us a bottle of Prosecco to keep things moving, which I appreciated, but not exactly what I'd expect at a tapas spot.   The food was good- lamb chops, suckling pig, meatballs, and stuffed dates- and they worked to accommodate our schedule, which we appreciated. We were offered dessert to make up for the wine list no-shows, and out came... tiramisu??? It was great tiramisu, definitely some of the better I've had in Charlotte, but again not what I'd expect from a Spanish restaurant. Overall, I will definitely give Malabar another shot or two, based mostly on the friendliness of the manager and the great location, but I hope they work out what kind of restaurant it wants to be- Italian, Spanish, fusion- and stick with it. Definitely going back for another try.",

    "text": "Malabar is definitely our go to spot for tapas in Charlotte. It's so cozy and located right on Tryon St. My husband and I generally grab a couple of seats at the bar (only about 6 seats total) or outside on the patio. The service is always excellent and they almost always have a special or something new on the menu. I also love that they offer a large selection of Spanish wines by the glass and by the bottle. Dishes worth trying- pan con tomate (so good that we almost always order two), churrasco with chimichurri, garlic shrimp, asparagus and mushrooms dish, and the empanadas. This is a great spot for date night or for a birthday dinner with friends, but be sure to make a reservation beforehand as the restaurant does not have many tables. Lastly, the tiramisu does not disappoint!",

    "text": "Went for a mid-week dinner and ended up on the \"patio\" area in the courtyard.  It was nicely protected from the wind and was beautifully set up and lit.  We had a lovely, funny security guard \"protecting\" us all evening.    The menu warns that the paella takes 35 minutes to prepare.  We ordered the Royale (everything) anyway.  It was worth the wait.  It was moist and flavorful, steaming upon delivery with succulent meats, juicy seafood, and a good sprinkling of colorful vegetables.  Between two of us, we got through a quarter of the pan.  Why did we manage to feast so little?  Because we had appetizers and a pitcher of sangria while we waited.  Turns out, they make sangria here exactly the same whether they're using red wine or white--including the fruit and the brandy (yes, they make it with brandy; heck yeah!).  The only difference is the color of the wine.  We went with red this time, but you better believe we'll be back again as it warms up more and we'll be trying the white, too.  The red was delish.  It accompanied our lightly toasted bread and three tapas: wilted spinach with raisins and pine nuts, sauteed asparagus and mushrooms atop what seemed like a roasted red pepper spread, and honey balsamic drizzled eggplant chips.  We loved them.    Because we knew we'd be heavy on the meat and seafood for the paella, the veggie tapas were perfect (PERFECT!) precursurs.  We'd thought about a couple of others, but as I saw neighboring tables order them, although they looked great, I think we made a good choice to stay strictly veggie and avoid any additional cheese or cream.  In the future I'll definitely flip the switch at some point and try meat and cheese tapas with a veggie paella.  So looking forward to future visits!  Malabar, you might end up being my summer love.",

    "text": "We came, we ate, we conquered Charlotte's Spanish tapas scene at Malabar... and likely won't come back. I'm giving our experience three stars because it's deserving of an \"A-OK\" description, but we aren't lining up our next trip any time soon.   First and foremost, our seat was in the very back corner of the small, one-room restaurant. Normally I think a smaller restaurant can give off a very intimate feel, but this was a little TOO intimate. I had to stand on my tip-toes to squeeze through to my seat in the corner booth, muttering an apology to the couple next to us as my rear end hovered likely much-to-close to their appetizer (oops, so sorry, that's not very appetizing).   We visited during Queen's Feast so had a more limited menu, and I really wasn't impressed or even intrigued by many of the first course options. We ended up choosing the lentils, which tasted as I had imagined my lentils would taste (and would typically not be a preference for an app), but they were nicely balanced with delicious ham and chicken croquettes (HIGHLY recommend these as a starter!).   My husband ordered the lomo de cerdo asado (i.e. the pork loin) for his main course, later admitting that the pork was dry without a sauce and the vegetables on the side were cold. Pretty disappointing.   I, on the other hand, had a fantastic main course. I chose the Zarzuela (i.e. the Spanish-style fish stew), and it was filled to the brim with delicious seafood. The side of fried yuka was pretty awful (tasted like freezer-burnt french fries), but again, the Zarzuela literally saved my entire dining experience. SO GOOD.  For dessert, my husband chose the flan, and I had the Tres Leches, which was mouth-wateringly tasty.   One last recommendation if you choose Malabar for your dining experience - go for the red wine sangria. It was very flavorful, a decent-sized pour, and helps you look past some not-so-palatable moments.",

The high ceilings and fabulous chandelier make the space very relevant and modern.  Malabar offers True Spanish tapas--exactly what you would find at a restaurant in Spain. I went with a group of girlfriends so we were able to try quite of a few options.  The croquettes con jamon y queso were wonderful: creamy, fried pillows with great flavor. The order of patatas bravas, french fries with a spicy red sauce and a creamy aioli, was generous. Pimientos rellenos were the star of the show--red bell peppers stuffed with rice and other delicious morsels. The churrasco, beef with a chimichurri sauce was great. Don't miss the tortilla! Made out of potatoes and eggs, it's truly delicious!! I would skip the mussels as they were gritty and the broth was too salty.   My friends said the white sangria was awesome, and the drink menu was extensive. Malabar is sneakily pricey though, so be cautious. Each tapa is $10-12 and the portions aren't that big. Malabar is perfect for happy hour noshing, or a drink and snack after a show in Uptown.",

In addition to the small plates, Malabar offers entrees and a selection of paella.  We sat outside and each ordered three plates from the menu. The tapas menu offers categories of meat, vegetables, cheese.and seafood.  Standouts were the Vaca Frita, (crispy beef with pickled onions) Croquetas, (ham, potato and manchego cheese) and the Lenteja, (lentils, ham and sofrito) from the Carne menu. Tigres (mussles in spicy red sauce), Pulpo (grilled octopus with potatoes and green and olives and the Calamar a la Plancha (Grilled Calamari) on the Seafood menu.  From the Vegetable menu we had the Patatas Brava (spicy potatoes), Tortilla Espanola (potato, onion omelette) and Championes (sauteed wild mushrooms).  With 9 dishes ordered, the waitress asked how we wanted them served. I said to leave it up to the kitchen and just bring them out three at a time. Great pairings of dishes on each \"course\".",

The food was not really that great, we ordered the Churrasco which was the suggestion from the waiter, over the special of the night, although it was very tasty was a very small portion, Tapas basic, and bread cold no olive oil or butter to go along with, surely not worth over $100, I think I will have to pass next time.",

    "text": "I recently tried out this Tapas establishment expecting to be hungry 15mins. after I ate.  This was not the case.  I am not usually a fan of Tapas for this reason, too little food too much money.     We started out with an Artichoke appetizer which was really just one little square of an Artichoke mix atop a slice of bread.  I ordered a nice Malbec but tried the Red Sangria and wish I had ordered that for the entire meal, it was delightful.   For our entree we had the Paella Royal, Sliced chorizo, Croquettes and Fiery Potatoes.  This was my first Paella but I know how the dish is made so it wasn't a total surprise.  I have to say, I avoided the baby Octopus and Prawns because they just freaked me out.  I'm used to my Octopus wrapped in sushi rice so there's a bit of a disconnect and I don't like beheading my meal before eating it.   Overall, the Paella was delicious but again, this is my first order of it.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly as was the various meat in the dish.  The pork rib in the meal did lack some actual Pork so that was a slight disappointment.  The sliced Chorizo tapa was smaller and sliced thinner that what I was expecting, think Prosciutto. It was good and we still didn't finish it so I suppose it doesn't matter that it was so thin.  I do highly recommend the Fiery potatoes (potatoes Brava!).  They came with a white sauce drizzled on top and just enough seasoning to have flavor without really being \"Fiery\".  The Croquettes were a little gooey but to be fair, they did only contain potatoes and manchego.     By accident, our server brought an order of what I believe to be Albondigas (beef meatballs).  Now, we were too involved in our conversation to really remember what we ordered so we did eat one meatball a piece before the server realized that it wasn't our order.  The meatballs were very good and I would recommend ordering them if you're into that sort of thing (meatballs without pasta or a bun).   This brings me to the service.  I'd like to point out that the place was slammed packed.  I was asked for my drink order within a few moments of seating but it took a long time to actually receive my wine.  I noticed that we weren't the only table that received the wrong food.  The table next to us also got an extra order of something along with the Sangria that I ordered.  I'd like to point out that it took a LOOOONG time for me to actually get my Sangria and our server never came around to make sure we were ok.  I did see other servers circling the restaurant so I don't know what the deal was with our side of the room.     For better service, try to dine here Mon-Wed. nights as it is insane on a Thursday (you know,pre-weekend).  With all the Tapas restaurants in Charlotte, this one didn't hold my taste buds enough to bring me back but instead to try other places.",

I wanted to start my meal with a cocktail. I was expecting to see a different variety of Rums, some Cachaca, something Spanish inspired. If memory serves me correct, a few of the drinks had Malibu Coconut rum and of course the Pisco Sour. I started my meal with the Gambas (shrimp). To put a long story short...they tasted rotten. Strangely, rotten. For my main course I had the Red Snapper (a La Plancha) with Wilted Spinnach. It was really amazing. Probably some of the best tasting Spinach I've had and the Snapper was cooked to perfection. Something I would try to recreate at home. For dessert I had the Tres Leches cake. It had a mild coconut flavor and it was good, nothing really outstanding. I really like the atmosphere at Malabar and the food is okay. Would I go back? Probably some time in the Spring to have cocktails al fresco and watch the people on the street.",

I highly recommend the creamy ham, potato, and manchego croquetas and the grilled baby octopus. The paella was really good and had lots of seafood and meat along with crispy rice! We were too full for dessert but had to order a tres leches to go... Midnite snack! Cool place to go for date night but i would sit at the bar next time as it gets pretty loud!

I like the decor of traditional mixed with art deco.  The full wall of mirrors makes the restaurant look very large.  So...the lunch menu offered great appetizers, tapas, sandwiches and more.  Appetizer was eggplant bruschetta.  Very good.  Followed by a great salad of mixed greens...that included a goat cheese croquette...yummy!  The small basket of bread with side of EVOO was a nice touch.  The chicken croquettes served on a small plate with a nice sauce was very good.  The chicken empanadas were just so good.  You could see and taste the red peppers as you bit into them.  Service was amazing for someone that had just started that day!  Very impressed. Looking forward to a return visit at night when the restaurant will be full of people!!!",

    "text": "Despite it being a Friday night in Uptown Charlotte, there were no crowds busting at the doors - the atmosphere was the perfect balance of relaxed and upscale. Along with the great ambience came great food.   For starters, our server brought us complimentary Spanish flatbread covered with a light tomato sauce. It was very refreshing and made me excited for the rest of the meal. My friend and I ordered three tapas:  - Pimientos Rellenos, stuffed roasted peppers -Tigres, mussels in spicy red sauce. My friend who doesn't even like seafood enjoyed them, so I would say they are pretty special.  -Albondigas, beef meatballs with tomato sauce. This is the dish I would recommend to anyone who comes to Malabar. Not only were the meatballs exceptional in texture and taste, but the sauce was what really what blew me away. It was all at once rich, light and creamy that it became the main part of our meal because we couldn't stop dipping our bread in it.   While I didn't order it this time, I will be stopping by Malabar soon to try their paella. I hear that they are made to order and would take 35 minutes to prepare. I will keep you posted and find out if it is as good as it sounds!",

    "text": "We decided that being a Tapas joint, Malabar would be a big hit during Restaurant Week. I'm a fan of sampling a bunch of different bites, and with the menu offering two Tapas, an entree and dessert this was a no-brainer to try. While nothing really blew us away it was still a very good meal.  We ate outside at Malabar, which was a good choice. My brief glimpse at the interior made me think of a cramped, dark, loud restaurant. On the other hand, the outdoor area had about ten tables there ran along a single line, so there were no strangers to do battle with for elbow space or to be inadvertently eavesdropping on each others conversations.   Our server was very friendly, though a bit needy. She popped by a bit too often, which isn't a bad thing at all...I'd rather the server come by too many times then not enough. The wine menu was interesting and offered some wines I was not familiar with, and the prices were reasonable. After delivering the wine some fresh bread and olive oil was brought over. I was surprised at how good the olive oil was...this is definitely the real deal they serve to dip your bread in, and not some cheap stuff they buy at Sam's Club or something in bulk.   For my Tapas I went with the Croquetas and the Pulpo. The Croquetas consisted of two mashed potato, ham and manchego cheese logs all deep fried to perfection. It was very tasty, and I loved how the potato and cheese melded together. However it got heavier with each bite, and I eventually got sick of it before finishing. It wasn't bad tasting at all, but just very heavy and rich, and too much was not good. The Pulpo was a generous portion of grilled octopus, potatoes and olives on a plate with some paprika or some other red seasoning/sauce. While I love calamari I was not a fan of the octopus. I don't think it was anything Malabar did wrong, but I just don't think I personally like the taste of octopus. It was very tender (which I wasn't expecting) but had a strange taste I did not care for.   The missus ordered the Garbanzo and Tigres. The Garbanzo is just what it sounds like...a heaping pile of chick peas. They were cooked pretty well and had some spinach mixed in with them, and they made for a nice, light appetizer. The Tigres are mussels that were cooked in a slightly spicy tomato sauce. The missus is a mussel fiend and she enjoyed both the shellfish themselves as well as the sauce. The Tigres came with one lone hunk of toasted bread to dip in the sauce, and once that was consumed the two of us finished off the table service bread with that delicious sauce.  For an entree (they call platos) I got the Churrasco. This is a grilled flank steak (at least that's my educated guess on the cut of meat) that is marinated in a chimichurri sauce. The steak was cooked to order (medium rare) but was still a touch tough. The sauce was done very well, though there was waaaaaay too much garlic in it. My plate was covered with probably over a hundred small chips of garlic, and that's just too much. It was served with some yucca fries and cilantro sauce that was good. The yucca was cooked good and had a simple taste, but the cook definitely had a heavy hand with the cilantro when it came to the sauce.  The missus went with Gambas al Ajo, which was a bowl of about eight jumbo shrimp. The shrimp were cooked in a tasty garlic sauce and had a nice, fresh bite to them. For a side she was given an order of patatas bravas which we both loved. These little potato wedges were cooked with a slight spice and served with a garlicy creamy sauce that was pretty tasty.  For dessert we both split an order of the Tres Leches cake and Empanadas Dulces. The Tres Leches cake was a super moist cake topped with whipped cream and caramel drizzle. This thing was SOAKED, and was almost like a sponge with all the sweet, sweet sugary milk it absorbed inside. I really enjoyed this dessert and recommend it, so long as you have a sweet tooth. The Empanadas Dulces were kind of like homemade Pop Tarts. The two pastries came out piping hot on the outside, and molten on the inside. The exterior pastry was flaky and had a decent taste to it, though I found it to be slightly bland. The interior was some kind of strawberry jam that was like lava. It was scorching hot and thick, and oozed out as you took each bite and erupted all over the table. I wasn't too crazy about it, and definitely preferred the Tres Leches.  Malabar has some pretty good eats in a nice location. I'm a sucka for Tapas so I'm sure we will be coming back to try more of these little bites.",

We started with the spanish meatball and the croquetas. The croquetas were awesome. Very flavorful. The Spanish meatballs were just ok. The flavor was good but it could have used a little salt. Then we  tried the rellenos (stuffed peppers). This was AMAZING. The cheese was great, the flavor and texture were spot on. After that we both had desserts. I had the chocolate mousse which came out in a cool little glass and was so decadent. My husband had tres leches. I am not a fan so didn't even bother trying it, but he thought it was great. The only thing I did find disappointing was the sangria. It had a little bit of a cocnutty flavor in it and wasn't very strong. I can't wait to go back here again to try some more tapas.",

We started with mojitos which are all made fresh, so it takes a little longer than pouring a glass of wine, so order as soon as you sit down.  Some of my favorite tapas: clams, mussels, crispy marinated beef, grilled calamari -so good - (it's the whole calamari, may not be what you are expecting, but so good!).  For the entrees we ordered paella, grilled skirt steak with chimichurri sauce and monkfish.  All very good.  We ordered too much paella - we had 6 of us and we should have gone for one more entree and ordered one less paella.  So, that would have been 4 entrees and 1 paella and that would have been enough. Lastly was dessert and we love the Tres Leches!  If you like chocolate the Chocolate & Cafe Mousse was good too!  The service, as usual, was great.  Very attentive.  We also got there right as at our reservation time and we able to sit down right away, which was very nice.  Great time and good food!",

We decided just to order lots of tapas for the whole table to share and I'm so glad we went this route. The croquetas were moist and the sauce they lay on was absolutely delicious. The favorite at the table was the almejas a la mancha which were clams and chorizo in a red sauce.  I could have made this my whole meal. We loved the Jamon Serrano!  Enough that we ordered two. We also devoured two of the Tortilla Espanola, a potato and onion omelet.  The great thing about tapas is that I usually have room left for dessert and I'm so glad I did in this case. The churros were served hot and with a delicious melted chocolate sauce! I'm not a huge flan fan but my husband absolutely loved it. The tres leche was superb but my favorite was the empanadas dulces which was berries and bananas in a pastry crust.  Lastly I must mention the sangria was excellent!  They chop their fruit up in tiny bite size pieces which we found genius.  I can't wait to do this next time I make Sangria at home.  Really looking forward to returning to this great establishment. Try it and you won't be disappointed!",

That place was a good Italian restaurant, but with a second Italian white table cloth restaurant by the same owner less than 100 feet away, trying something different was a great idea.  Now you find Malabar in it's rightful place.  Small but suitable patio for outside eating, great staff that warmingly greets you, a lot of wonderful options in food, and if you're willing to be a little daring, you can venture out with some new options.  They have a great mix of Spanish cuisine.  There's a healthy mix of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and some Mexican dishes around.  My favorite is the lamb by far.  I try to avoid meat when I can but it's quite irresistible here.  A close second would be the stuffed peppers and the potato dishes.  Really good stuff.  On top of that, fore being such a small place, they have a great bar and an excellent wine selection.  The manager Angelo always has me pushing my boundaries and trying something new.  I'll be damned if he's not right most of the time.    Check it out, try it out and if nothing else you'll come away with a great experience.  Or you'll be like me and coming back for more and more and more...",

    "text": "I can't tell you how excited I am that Malabar opened in Charlotte. After living in Spain for a year, this is as close as it gets to Spanish food. Mind you the waiters are not all from Spain and some of the food like canelones is italian and yukka is central/south american.   Came here for my friend's birthday. They were so great that they catered to all 15ish of us on separate checks, bless their heart, it's not the norm, but they were nice enough to accomodate us. And take a million pictures of us on our iphones.   I'd recommend getting a whole bunch of tapas split between everyone as opposed to one tapa or entree for yourself. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I was in a painful food coma after dinner bc I attempted a full course meal: 1 tapa, 1 churrasco, and the tres leches cake. Too many good tapa options here: patatas bravas, canelones, albondigas, croquetas, lomo, tortilla patata, jamon serrano, the list goes on...).   I can't wait to go back...I'd like to try the paella but be aware that you must call ahead because it takes 35 minutes to prepare.",

    "text": "So I'm completely confused as to why a Spanish tapas restaurant is called \"Malabar\" when that word usually refers to an area of India, but no one consulted me when they (mis)named the eatery.   What I'm not confused about is how delicious the food was, and how impressed I was with our unflappable server. Even when he was confronted with a table of seven raucous blogger type ladies in town for a blog convention, he suggested dishes to share which suited the vegetarians and two of us who have shellfish allergies. As our Friday night dinner hour went on, however, he appeared to be oversat, and that affected his timing on refreshing drink orders.   We were sucking down the red and white Sangria like we knew what we were doing. He needed back up, and if you drink enough of that light and refreshing Sangria on a hot summer evening, you will, too.   The Paellas were excellent and served in the pans in which they are cooked, and two orders were enough for all of us to share along with several small plates. The Croquetas, Pimientos Rellenos and the Manchego were among my favorites, and I wish now that I had ordered the Yuccas Fritas.   It filled up pretty quickly during our visit, so I would definitely suggest a reservation at this taste of Spain in uptown Charlotte.",

My personal favorite was the paella which was great since I had actually been hunting around town for some for a while now.

Couple things to consider: this place is tiny. I would call ahead for a reservation. There is outdoor seating (limited) The service was slow.

    "text": "We've paid several visits to Malabar, the first was amazing and the others that followed were just so-so.  We have always enjoyed Toscana, our favorite Conti restaurant so we expected our continued visits to hold up at Malabar. During our first stop, the bartender helped us choose a nice red wine, there were vegetarian items included in the specials, and the chef treated us to a few more off the menu. It was truly a great experience.  During our next visit, about a week later, that bartender didn't work there anymore,we had few meatless options, and the staff seemed very disorganized. They changed our waiter midway through our meal, the wine list had already changed, the experience was clearly not as pleasant as the first. We visited another time or two and felt the same inconsistency with the wine and the staff.  We came back the last time with friends, only because it was prearranged, hoping for a better experience. The staff still seemed to be a little disorganized and the food not nearly as wonderful as our first visit, when the chef had time to treat us.  We may give Malabar another try, but it's already been a few months.",

    "text": "Four of us checked out Malabar during Restaurant Week. None of us had visited before so we were all excited to see what we've been missing. We were immediately impressed with the warm but modern decor but felt a little bit squeezed into our table in the middle of the room.   Our options from the Restaurant Week menu were incredible. We could pick 2 tapas, 1 entree, and 1 dessert. Because there were 4 of us, we tried to order 8 different tapas - brilliant. They were delicious. The seafood tapas options were the highlights... We didn't hit it out of the ballpark, however, for our entree. Both couples decided to order paella. 2 people must order & share - FYI! Silly us, there were other entree options we liked but we felt like we HAD to order paella. It was ok. Just ok. I am glad I tried it - I was able to recreate a similar version at home after our visit - but, truly, I wasn't overjoyed. I wouldn't order it again - next time I might just stick with the tapas menu.   Our one issue... We brought our own wine ($15 corkage fee - no problem) and our server gladly opened our bottles for us. After realizing we were pressed for space, we probably shouldn't have requested 2 wine glasses apiece - but we did. In an attempt to make room before our food came, our server combined glasses of wine - without asking! Ugh. Other than that, our server was excellent, the secondary staff helping with bread & water were hit  or miss - mainly due to language barriers.   Check out Malabar - Charlotte is lucky to have this delicious, Spanish restaurant in uptown.",

The host, who doubles up as the guy who takes your order is warm and welcoming. Once seated, we ordered a round of drinks, including a pitcher of sangria. I thought the sangria was a bit insipid and not-so-great but not horrible.  We ordered an assortment of tapas to share across the table, and we all thought the food was pretty good. I was a bit underwhelmed by the lamb chops. I would have liked them to have more flavor. The churrasco was REALLY good, as were the shrimp. The chicken empanadas were very tasty, but could use a bit more chicken :(  The few vegetarian items we ordered were pretty decent as well, but nothing to write home about.  I strongly recommend the churrasco and the shrimp. Overall, I would like to come back and try this place again and hopefully agree with all the 4-star reviewers!",

They open up all these available times on OpenTable, but when your party shows up, the whole restaurant is full, and they have no available tables for at least 30-45 min from when you reserved.

    "text": "I came to this restaurant with really high expectations given the reviews and comments from a few friends.   The restaurant is nice inside and has outdoor seating which is a plus.   Once we got seated, a gentlemen which I assume was the manager served us. He was very reserved, even slightly awkward. Although he did everything he needed to, I didn't get any hospitality from him. No welcome, suggestion, or presentation from the menu.   People like this make it seem as if they don't want to be there. Enthusiasm even if faked can make patrons feel more at home.  My date and I ordered the seafood paella. I was really hoping it would taste similar to the paella I've hadin Barcelona, Madrid, and Andalucia...but it fell quite short.   The patella is I think $16 or $18 per person and a paella for two had the following: two jumbo shrimp, two scallops, lots of mussels a few clams and calamari and sofrito.  The scallops were cooked perfectly nice and soft but the fact there was only two was a big disappointment. The shrimp were decent but again only two. The clams and mussels were good but those are hard to screw up on.   The calamari was WAY overcooked to the point it was rubbery. Ew. It also tasted very bland.   Overall the dish just lacked protein. It's as if they load you up on the cheap stuff (calamari and mussels) and give you just a teasing amount of the really good stuff (shrimp and scallops). If you are gonna charge a premium for a quintessential Spanish dish, at least give it more value or at a minimum a picture showing what to expect.   If I would have known it was just two shrimp and two scallops plus cheap seafood i would have gotten something else.   I will be back to try the seafood stew and perhaps a tapa or two. Hopefully my opinion of this restaurant will change then.",

We tried the croquettes, sauteed mushrooms, and beef empanadas. The croquettes and empanadas were awesome-full of flavor! I liked that the empanadas featured shredded beef-they reminded me of ropa vieja in an empanada shell. The ham and cheese croquettes were also really good-crispy outside with a creamy center. Several other reviews had suggested the mushrooms, saying they are really good paired with the bread but I found the bread to be a bit dense and almost stale and the mushrooms to be just okay. I can make better sauteed mushrooms at home. The atmosphere was also just okay, decent outside seating, nice to be downtown, but nothing overly impressive. Overall, good experience. I would go back for the croquettes if I were in Charlotte again, but I wouldn't make a special trip just to try Malabar. If you've been to Mateo in Durham, it's 1,000x better for a tapas night and worth a special day trip any day of the week. Was hoping I would feel the same about Malabar but it just didn't leave me with the same impression.",

We waited for a good 30 minutes before getting our dishes and they all came at the same time, which resulted in some being cold.  Secondly, the dishes were under-flavored.

Just plain old crappy Popov.  And the drink was $9.  So, I refused it and she very willingly swapped it out for a different drink.  Again, it is a nice place to go to one time.  That's all.",

    "text": "I had family in town during restaurant week and my mom suggested we try Malabar because the menu for restaurant week provided a lot of choices.  Everything we ate was delicious. In particular the croquetas and gambas al ajillo from the tapas menu were bigger than I expected.  For entrees our party of 4 tried 3 of the 5 offerings: Suquet de Mariscos, Albondigas con arroz, Mixed grill. Everything was delicious. The rice almost out-shined the albondigas. Definitely inspired me to return to try their paella.  Desserts were good- light but sweet- however, definitely not as memorable as the tapas and platos.  Music was not too loud and well-selected, playing one of my favorites from Barcelona, who had just been to CLT recently, Jarabe de Palo.  Beer selection also included a little taste of Cataluna including the more difficult to find in the States, Estrella Damm.  To sum up, the food and drinks (including an affordable wine selection by glass) would definitely bring me back for a second try.  My only negative, which may speak more to restaurant week than to Malabar, was that I did feel rushed. There definitely wasn't \"sobremesa\" time. The wait staff was attentive, maybe overly so. At one point the waitress tried to take my plate with my pan con tomate (which we ordered extra off the regular menu and was worth it) even before I was finished and my sangria glass when I still had some left in my glass. Not huge criticisms, but for me, one of the best parts of Spanish eating- besides the flavors- is the sharing and relaxing over delicious food without worry for time or pace.  Overall it was a great meal.",

    "text": "Went here for New Year's Eve. This was our second visit and was just as good as the first. Started with a nice bottle of Spanish wine and then the crispy croquettes and a mushroom tapas recommended by the waitress. Both were delish!  I ordered the nightly special with red snapper and clams and mussels. Great dish. Fresh fish and a light sauce. Wife had the monk fish dish with tomatoes and chick beans. She loves this dish and has had it before. Both were super tasty. For dessert we went with tres leches and that was wonderful.   Great place with reasonable prices in uptown. Check it out.",
