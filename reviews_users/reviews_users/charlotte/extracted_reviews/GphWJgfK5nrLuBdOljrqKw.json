We ordered the calamari as an appetizer (it was amazing! But has onions in it which is not described on the menu). The crunchy  caterpillar was good but the volcano was amazing. Overall this restaurant was pretty average but a great price. The food was good and the area was clean and the staff was nice.",

    "text": "They delivered dinner right to my hotel room door.  With a $20 minimum dinner order they'll deliver for free.  When it comes to sushi it's easy to spend that much.  I ordered a serving of won ton soup, the tempura roll, the lobster roll, and a bottle of water for a total of $25 before tip.  The won ton soup hit the spot.  The broth with scallions was delicous with a hint of ginger without being spicy.  It was only two or three won tons, but it was enough of a serving.  The tempura roll was average and fine.  The lobster roll was a huge disappointment.  The menu description was boiled lobter with cucumber.  And it was just that, but the lobster was hard, like cardboard, and hard to chew.  It came with duck sauce and soy sauce, but that didn't help.  I couldn't eat it all, and I love lobster.  I would try them again, especially since they deliver, but I would order different rolls.",

It's a good spot for lunch or dinner and I say that because I have been here for lunch as well as dinner. What I have noticed is that this place gets crowded pretty quickly in lunch time compare to dinner. The service is pretty standard to what you would expect from Chinese place however you get little more attention during dinner since it's not that crowded and I think the waitress is cute for dinner time LOL   The food is good for my taste where I tried to get anything cooked in garlic sauce and it just comes out to my taste :D I am big fan of veg lo mein and this place just hit the spot.   They also have small bar area. I think there is a patio area  if you prefer outdoor but make sure it's not windy because the one time we decided to seat out, it was pretty windy and we ended up moving inside.   Oh the other thing I noticed is that I think their price is pretty reasonable considering it's in uptown :D",

    "text": "I applaud the look of this place and the artistry of the setup at the sushi bar. My primary goal was to relax for half an hour or so between professional obligations and grab an appetizer and a beer, and Fujo definitely accommodated those needs in a timely fashion.  Being in the Carolinas and craving something with a bit of heat, I opted for the Cajun Roll which featured crayfish with shrimp and crab. It was nothing mind-blowing, but neither was it repulsive. Since moving the South I've learned that one was must accept, I've learned to be thankful for what I can get in the sushi department. However, I was really not a particularly big fan of the hot-and-sour soup. The ingredients were not particularly fresh, and the un-nuanced broth was just on the verge of being genuinely unpleasant  to get down.  This place still has a certain charm to it, but it's probably not Charlotte's best work from a culinary standpoint.",

In fact, it might be the best sushi place I've been to in Charlotte, competing with my evergreen love for Cowfish.  I took the recommendations of others and opted for the Godzilla Roll. Absolutely freaking delicious; 10/10. The tempura was divine, as was the sauce, as was the filling. All of it. Their fried pork dumplings were tasty too - I prefer mine to be crunchier than the ones they served, but they were delightfully flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Spicy Eel and Spicy Yellowtail rolls. I thought they seemed a bit skimpy on the rice and not spicy at all, but the fish and eel themselves were tender and plentiful. The food did come out quickly, so we were pleased with that. And the hot sake was pretty good, even though I don't like sake all that much.  Really my only [minor] complaint was the service. The manager (I assume) was quite nice, but our server was not very attentive. It was enough to knock off one star, but not enough to keep me from going back.",

This one is rated with two $$.  Truthfully some of the best sushi I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  They were not skimpy by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give up, so the man happily picked up the slack.    I'm only on town for the weekend, so I have no idea if they run specials throughout the week.

When I questioned their signs, they reiterated that 10 was for takeout only and that they stopped serving in the restaurant at 9:30. Again, this was at exactly 9:31. What a joke. Restaurants like this that don't understand the meaning of customer service and don't deserve to remain in business.

We split a salmon roll, a spicy tuna roll and a Godzilla roll. The salmon was too tough to be chewed. The spicy tuna roll had tempura flakes on the outside that tasted horribly stale and like they'd been cooked in extremely rancid oil. The Godzilla roll was yummy but not amazing - it was the most redeeming part of the meal for sure though. We also tried the sesame tofu and it was a huge disappointment - the tofu was so hard it was difficult to chew and it came with almost no veggies (4 tiny broccoli florets don't count). Our server was friendly and attentive and that's what's keeping this review from being a lower one. I didn't send anything back or complain to the server because it was a week night, we were tired, and we knew we wouldn't be back again.   All in all, it was def not my best groupon date night.

Food is very good and the plating is nice. My only complaint is that we went twice and both servers were not good. First one was a little cocky and arrogant. Second server really didn't care about his job. He literally walked up to us and didn't greet us but said \"Want anything besides water?\" Not a lot of other tables were there but he was super slack. Drinks were low and the manager/owner actually walked out of his office to give us refills. Server then asked if we wanted dessert and we declined. You would of thought he would bring the check out to us after that. No, he didn't. We waited there for over 10 minutes and didn't see him. He finally walked by us and looked dumbfounded and asked \"Oh, did you want your check or something?\" Overall, manager is nice and food is good. Also nice they will stamp your parking pass if you park in the Wells Fargo garage.",

Purchased a Groupon and no where in the fine print (which I always read to avoid situations EXACTLY like this one) did it say DINE-IN Only. Many do however, which is why I specifically purchased it so I could do a to-go order. I walk in and there is literally NO ONE in the entire restaurant besides the guy behind the sushi bar. No cashier, no waiters, no one. So I wait for a few minutes, and finally a guy (really wish I had gotten his name) comes out and ask if he can help me. I tell him I made an order online to go and I have a Groupon. He replies that they don't accept Groupon for to-do orders. Now he could've stopped there, but then he follows it up with \"It says it clearly on the Groupon\". Like most people would do, I open the app and recheck it and NO WHERE, I repeat, NO WHERE does it say anything along the lines of \"reservation only\" or \"dine-in only\" nothing. What it does say is this: \"May be repurchased every 90 days. Limit 1 per person, may buy 1 additional as gift. Limit 1 per visit. Limit 1 per table.\" I read this to him and instead of attempting to be accommodating, he (I kid you not) rolls his eyes and says \"You can either dine-in or pay full price \". ALRIGHT. I try to keep my cool and stay polite and go sit at a table (what difference it made, made zero sense to me). He's claimed at this point his manager won't allow it or make any exceptions. I just wanted to get my food, pay and leave at this point.  So he brings my food and I ask for the check immediately. He says \"if you don't attempt to eat it here then we still won't accept it.\" At this point I'm over it, so I tell them to keep the food, and walk out. As I do, I trade in the Groupon for another restaurant and go later that night. Never going back!",

The wine glass I got was dirty but the prices were reasonable. I ordered an eel roll and a shrimp roll. The eel was too fishy and crunchy and the shrimp was very bland. Overall wasn't overly enthused and paid and left. Wouldn't go back for sushi.",

Service was quick and attentive....even though I was the first to order and had to wait about 5 extra minutes AFTER everyone else got their order.....Strike 1.  I got the Malay Sauce dish with chicken and shrimp. They give you LOTS of fried rice (or any rice you order) which makes the plate look deceivingly large, but in reality it is NOT that big of a portion....whic is OK for lunch. But the chicken and shrimp portions were unusually SMALL (i.e., not that much of it) and they were definitely skimpy on the Malay Sauce. Strike 2.  The flavors were.....somewhat BLAND. Not bad, but compared to something like Hasaki Grill, they just cannot compete. Strike 3.  Not horrible but given the Uptown choices (Room 112, Hasaki, Enzo, etc.) there are FAR better choices than Fujo.",

    "text": "I don't recommend this place for sushi.  I had the Godzilla roll, ikura (salmon roe) nigiri and saba (mackerel) nigiri.  The sushi rice for the nigiri is not correctly prepared, and the taste and texture are wrong.  For the ikura, the roe itself is fine and perfectly tasty, but the odd rice, and the fact that there is too much rice in proportion to the roe, makes this a chewy, imbalanced sushi.  The saba is acceptable, although a bit fishy as commercially-pickled mackerel tends to be.  The Godzilla roll is a travesty.  Utterly flavorless.  The cream cheese part of the filling seems to be mixed with spicy mayo, which still manages to taste like nothing.  The only flavor comes from the drizzle of teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo sauce (ick).  It's crunchy on the outside, yes, but even that has no flavor.  Uninspired.  Service was slow at 12:30 on a Monday afternoon, even though the place was not jammed.  Somewhat disappointing.  This place serves Chinese food also, and what I saw and smelled of that on other tables seemed appetizing, so perhaps this place is better for Chinese food.",

I ordered enough to honor the groupon (which was 3 sushi rolls and green tea). When the check arrived, the waiter told me I could not use my groupon. I then stated that the hostess assured me that I could when I first arrived. The owner came out and demanded I pay full price because it was not dinner time. I told the owner that the hostess said I could use the groupon, to which the hostess denied to the owner of ever saying that. She then left the restaurant or hid in the kitchen where I couldn't confront her. The owner told me that she was new and therefore didn't know anything about groupon, So \"I WAS AT FAULT\" and therefore demanded I pay full price. I also offered to pay a dinner price (if there was one, to which he said my sushi would be $20 dollars EACH, however, their menus online state they are only $10 at lunch/dinner time - so he was only trying to get money out of me). 15 minutes of arguing, me vs. the owner with all the employees watching, I started crying. The owner then stopped demanding and took the groupon, stating that I am never to come back and never to buy their groupon again.   WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I told the hostess about the groupon the moment I walked in and this is how I'm treated!   Only positive was the waiter who served me was sympathetic when I was leaving and apologized for the matter.   Please take my advice and don't support this kind of behavior.",

They sat me at the bar area and were very attentive as I mentioned I was looking to be in and out as quickly as possible.   When it comes to sushi I'm a big shrimp tempura fan, so I asked if they could specifically make that roll for me with just shrimp and asparagus. They were very accommodating and had the roll made within 10 minutes during what was a pretty busy lunch period. The roll was good, but definitely nothing special compared to other sushi places. The service was great though and they have a great lunch menu that's everything under 10 dollars.   Solid place with good sushi but nothing mind blowing.",

As the other reviewers have mentioned, it's a good idea to get there before (or after) peak lunch time, as the speedy service is wiped out when you have to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The food is good, not great, and is a bit benign on the creativity scale.  It's a fairly straightforward asian fusion place that offers americanized versions of Chinese and other Asian cuisine.  It's really not that special, and some dishes (Singapore noodles) you wonder why they're charging $9 for them.  It's a safe place to go for the less-than-adventurous lunch crowd that's looking to \"try something new\".  It won't knock your socks off, but it's not going to be bad either.",

From the menu online I was a little disappointed to not see Sushi Lunch Options, like a few others in Uptown offer.  I ordered the miso soup, ginger salad and the Charlotte Delight Roll (tuna, steamed shrimp and avocado inside; white tuna, tuna and avocado on top). By the time I arrived I paid at the counter and my order was just coming out of the kitchen, perfect timing.  The miso was good, but definitely needed to be reheated in the microwave, I like my soup hot, not just warm.  The salad, just okay. The ginger dressing was a little runny then others I have enjoyed. Good flavor, but not my favorite. As for the Charlotte Roll, awesome.  The amount of fish was great and it was very fresh. The rice was perfectly cooked and not too much either, just the right amount.  Overall I was very satisfied, but would love a few sushi lunch options. And, one thing to note, although I did not dine in, the restaurant was packed, with a wait list, at 10 and 12.  Something to remember if you are headed that way.",

After my son ate his egg roll he complained about his throat feeling weird. We asked server again and he asked the manager. Manager said there was peanut butter in egg rolls. My wife ran out with son and luckily found benedryl.  No discount for almost sending my son to the hospital. Don't trust going back there again.",

Walk in and I hear a voice yell \"can I help you?\" It took me a while to figure out who was speaking and if they were speaking to me. Hostess never bothered to get up and greet the customers coming in as she was sitting at a table folding napkins yelling at each one that walked through the door.   After I located the person speaking to me I was a little confused as to her questioning, how about \"Hello, welcome to Fujo would this be dine-in or carry out?\" Not \"CAN I HELP YOU\" obviously I'm here to eat, show me a menu or help me find a seat.   There were about 10-15 people in the restaurant and service was extremely slow.   As you can see I have NEVER written a review but I felt the inadequate service I received today called for one.",

From sushi to general Tao chicken... The service is also not bad. However this is considered on par given its prime location. The reason why I shed two stars is that first, the food quality isn't consistent. Appetizer in general is not bad. The crispy roll, seaweed salad, dumplings... you can't go wrong. The entree sometimes can't make me eat half of it; Sometimes it is good. it's like a lottery. Another star shed because they got my order wrong.... twice... considering I've dined here about less than 7 times, it is pretty bad.",

I started sampling a few crab rangoons, a bite of the fried tofu, and some egg drop soup. Not even 30-40 minutes after consuming the food I began to vomit uncontrollably which lasted for hours into the night. Needless to say I tossed the food out so my boyfriend wouldn't get sick.   I called Fujo the following day after I got home from work and talked to what sounded like a hostess. I explained my story and asked if I could have a refund for the $30 of food I ordered. She said because I did not call that night when it happened that that would not be possible but that she would have the owner call me back. It has been a few days and I have yet to hear anything.  I am a college graduate of the local Culinary school hear in Charlotte and I am extremely displeased in how unprofessional this restaurant has handled their poor sanitation issue regarding a customer. I will not be returning, and I will be sure to warn my friends.",

    "text": "Overall, I find Fujo to be fairly average, but it's convenient and if you know what to order you can get a good meal.    You can ask for all white meat in your chicken dish, so if you have a problem with weird, inedible black pieces of meat in your GENERAL's or SESAME CHICKEN, specify all white meat and that problem goes away.    I've ordered GENERAL's and SESAME TOFU many times in varying ways, but finally realized that this dish is not going to work for me here.  They cut the tofu into very large triangles and fry (without any breading).  So you get a tough, extremely hard edged piece of tofu to try to chew.  Inevitably you will not be able to chew it properly, sobeware of throat lacerations if you try to swallow it.  I've tried to order it in smaller pieces (didn't work), and less fried (also a fail).    I recently discovered their EGGPLANT with GARLIC SAUCE.  It's actually very good, as long as the eggplant pieces are cut small enough.  The sauce is very flavorful, and they'll even make it with less oil upon request.    I know several people who love the noodle dishes, and it does seem to be a lot of food for a decent price.  The service here is quick and efficient.  You can get in and out at lunch time in 30 minutes or less.  If you get your order to go, check the bag to see if you have enough soy or other sauces.  I find that 2 packets of soy aren't enough for me, so I always have to ask for extra.",

Went to Fujo on Friday night for dinner cause we had a Groupon. The place was very empty and we decided to sit outside since it was nice out! The outside basically looks out onto a huge fountain, so it was nice.   Ordered a couple of bottled beers. They dont have any draft beers and their bottle selections werent really that great.  We got the steamed dumplings as an appetizer and split 3 rolls: Godzilla, Sunset, and the Charlotte Delight Roll. All three were very good. The Sunset roll was my favorite cause I loved that garlic sauce on top. The Godzilla roll was my husbands favorite.....though, I thought it was just too much going on! I thought everything was well priced (all three rolls under $10 each) and we will definitely return for a casual dinner date.",

The location is great as far as views but you will probably have to pay for parking as it is in downtown Charlotte.

Portion sizes were generous especially on the sushi. Usually you don't get enough sushi to fill you up but this place really delivered! The service was a little slow and impersonal so that's why I gave it four stars instead of five. All in all, I would definitely go back!

    "text": "In an attempt to rid myself of the bad taste left by some dreadful airport sushi I had the other day, I was eager to get back to my favorite sushi place in Charlotte. I played it safe and went with my two favorite specialty rolls: the Philly Melt and the Hot Lava.  Fujo's Philly Melt is my favorite cream cheese roll I've ever had...it just melts in your mouth. Still, my very favorite overall is the Hot Lava roll. I swear, I would bath in the hot lava sauce if I could. Although not quite big enough to accommodate an adult male body, it is pretty huge and I've been known to dip other rolls in what's left over.   I always tell myself to try some of the other specialty rolls but I can't bring myself to pass on my two faves...It might require me to develop a new allergy to shrimp or cream cheese.  UPDATE: Dined in for the first time yesterday. I arrived around 6:00 and there were only two couples there. Needless to say, I was seated immediately and was waited on by like 3 different people. The service was very good and very fast...I think they refilled my water like 5 times in the half hour I was there.   I wanted to try some rolls I've never had, so I ordered the Tokyo, Godzilla, and Sunset rolls. The Tokyo roll was unique in that it was fried and then re-rolled in rice. The Godzilla roll was delicious but it was pretty similar to the Philly Melt, which I prefer because of the cream cheese. The Sunset roll was my favorite because of the yummy garlic sauce. By using a Groupon, I got all three rolls for less than $20 after tax and tip. Not bad at all!  UPDATE: Ordered the Magician's Roll, Cajun Roll, and the Panther Roll. Of the three, the Panther Roll was my favorite, which is hard for me to admit given that I'm a Giants fan and I hate Cam Newton. My least favorite was the Magician's Roll, although it did look pretty amazing with all the colorful caviar. I ordered the Cajun Roll because I've never had crawfish in sushi and the cajun spice sounded intriguing, but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.",

The tempura smelled and tasted like it was made with onion ring batter. So heavy and greasy. Nothing like tempura.   The avocado on top of the crunchy caterpillar roll was completely brown, I couldn't even bring myself to eat it, I took it off and ate the roll without it. Well, the few pieces I could stomach, it wasn't good at all.   The Singapore noodles were just ok. They only have chicken (no pork or shrimp like usual) and after the tempura and roll, I was frankly too scared to even try the chicken. The noodles were either the wrong noodles or overcooked (thicker than they usually are). The flavor wasn't bad.   Definitely will not order from this place again.",

We started with the calamari, that was served with a spicy mayo with fried onions and peppers. It was good, but more fried than I prefer. However, the portion was huge and it was only $7.   For our meal we opted for sushi: spicy tuna ($4.95), California roll ($4.95), spider ($7.95) and the hot lava roll ($11.85). The hot lava roll was shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and avocado rolled in a soybean wrap, which cause the roll to have a pink appearance. All of the rolls were good, but the hot lava roll was not spicy. I think they forgot to add the \"hotness\" to it ;-) however everything was delicious.   The quality of the sushi was also a plus for the price. There are a lot of sushi places in Charlotte and I think Fujo was a great value for the money. I will definitely return again.",

All were absolutely delicious and perfect for sharing.   I ordered sushi, others fried rice, noodle dishes, or entrees. The food all came out so fast! Except the sushi. That took the longest by far, and I was the only one at the table waiting on my food. It looked like there was only one sushi chef, so that's probably why there was a bit of delay. However the restaurant wasn't terribly busy when we were there. Waiting for the sushi wasn't a huge deal for me, but figured I'd mention it anyway.   All of the food we ordered was so good. The portions were really big, you could probably share a dish between two people. We all left with takeout boxes full of leftovers. I'd come back here for sure!",

Just understaffed and it was clear after waiting 20 minutes that I needed to leave if I wanted food.    Here, I was seated immediately.  I ordered the crab Rangoon which was some of the best I've ever had.  It was hot and fresh.  The sushi was really good but not great.  I loved the Volcano Roll but the Shrimp Tempura roll is were my meal fell short.  The roll had so much breading that it was not enjoyable.  I chose to fill up on the other parts of my meal and leave that roll behind.  Overall, great and quick option.  I'd be interested to see if the Chinese dishes are better than the sushi.",

It was not too busy which made it even better.   Now let's get to the important stuff and that is the food. We started of with the steam dumplings which were cooked perfectly. The dumplings were tender, fluffy, and savory.   I ordered the Hawaiian fried rice which was prepared with soy sauce. (Server suggested the soy sauce). The dish was well balanced and the pineapples added a different touch (sweet & salty). However, my only suggestion is that the pineapples should be cut in smaller pieces.  My wife ordered sushi rolls (Godzilla & Magician) these were fresh and savory. The caviar on the magician roll had a sweet and beautiful touch to the dish.   This was a great spot and we will be coming back again.",

My girlfriends and I celebrated my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some good and reasonably priced sushi!   We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  And there's really just no need to go on and on about just how happy that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.  But let's get to what everyone wants to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite it's officially my \"go to\" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a \"must try\" on the menu. It's packed with spicy tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. My goodness. How could you go wrong with that combination?    Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely worth a try!",

I come here every time I am in Charlotte and I'm in Charlotte at least every two months...in any case my long overdue review is a rave one. I suppose that is a \"given\" since I come every trip but thought clarification might be necessary. I have to say that Fujo is consistently great across all my criteria. I have yet to encounter someone who hasn't greeted me with a smile when I've come in. They clearly get a lot of carry out and delivery orders (via DoorDash), but the restaurant is nice and allows for indulgence in Sake...something perfect with my sushi after a long workday! I've tried a variety of the menu but have to say my absolute favorite is the Bonsai roll. I have sampled others I enjoy but Bonsai remains my favorite hands down. Colleagues I've brought to Fujo quickly have agreed that has a distinct flavor and kick they can't get enough of!  Honestly, in my opinion, it would be difficult to go wrong with any menu selection...but sushi fans must try the Bonsai! If you're in the area I encourage you to make sure and check out Fujo!",

The most recent trip, I ordered to go. I originally came up this way for a food truck, but the line was crazy so I decided to get Fujo. They have great lunch specials for both Chinese and sushi combos. And our food was ready pretty fast. In the past I've dined in and service was really slow, so I was glad to go was quicker.   This trip I ordered the two roll combo with a spicy tuna roll, avocado roll and side salad. The salad was okay. Sometimes I get a craving for ginger dressing. This one seemed a little more on the sweet side which I didn't like. The sushi rolls we're okay. The avocado had just avocado and was heavy on rice and the spicy tuna had a lot of crunch inside and wasn't very spicy. I was hoping for a drizzle of spicy mayo and it wasn't there. I do like they give you a cup for the soy sauce so I was able to easily dip my sushi. I've just had better sushi.   I'd be willing to give the Chinese dishes another try or the sushi rolls not on special. It seems to be a popular place and suits any Asian food cravings.",

The atmosphere was great and i'll definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Every city has a place like this.  It's a semi-upscale Chinese restaurant that also serves sushi.  While in Charlotte on a trip, I found Fujo on the ground floor of the hotel/office building complex I was staying at.  Luckily, I also found a Groupon for a slightly cheaper meal option. While Fujo isn't outrageously expensive, the discount definitely made it worth trying.   Suprisingly, Fujo wasn't busy at all early Friday evening.  As such, the service was attentive and the food came out quickly.  Of course, the food is the key here, so let's review and discuss.  Pan fried pork dumplings? Ok.  They were slightly oily coming out of the fryer and the sauce with it could've benefited from a touch of spice. The General Tso's Chicken was of high quality, but had way too much citrus taste and not enough spice.  Heck, to be honest, it had no spice.  In short.  Neat location.  Great service.  Food needs some improvement.",

I recommend getting there before 11:45 or you might have to wait.  Fujos packs up their to-go orders really well too, for those in a rush.  Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and everything is delicious.  I usually go with the sushi roll lunch special with a side salad.  The spicy tuna is my choice.  Today I switched it up and went with the hot lava roll.  I've also had the Godzilla roll.  Both rolls are really incredible!!!!!    Be on the look out for Groupons or living social coupons for Fujos!",

    "text": "I came here on the $15 for $30 of food deal from Groupon.  This is a well-hidden little spot located on the inside of the Wells Fargo building. Needless to say, it took me and my GPS a good 5 mins trying to figure out where it was and how to get in (the entrance is right across the street from Amelie's uptown).  The inside is small, dimly lit for ambience with a good sized sushi bar area. I came about an hour before close and I was sat immediately since they weren't too busy. My server was patient with me as I took forever and a day trying to calculate how many rolls I could get with my $30 deal and I finally decided to get the rainbow roll, the lobster roll and the crab rangoon appetizer  The rainbow roll was delicious and fresh, but I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce that it came with.   The lobster roll was HORRIBLE. Horrible, horrible, horrible! Aside from the countless amount of SHELL that was still on the meat (I'm assuming it was tail meat because the shell wasn't very hard), it was SO bland- even when I drowned it in soy sauce it tasted like salted nothing.  I had high hopes for it and was horribly let down. I should've sent it back, but it was late and I didn't want to be a burden since I was the last person to come in before they closed so I picked through what I could and moved on with my meal.  On the upside, the crab rangoons were BOMB. Crunchy wantons filled with soft, gooey crabby goodness. They were a little more sweet than I'm used to, but I still enjoyed them. I TRIED not to eat all of them by myself, but....  All in all, this place was okay. Not that great, but definitely not the worst. I may come back and give it another shot, but I rebuke that lobster roll in the name of Jesus.",

Warm, welcoming, friendly; it made the dining experience that much more memorable and helped to ease any anxieties I had about a new sushi spot.  And the food.  My goodness the food was good. Hardly a gourmand myself, for the price, the taste and the quantities were perfect - and I must admit the chef surprised me with the Tokyo roll with bits of caviar dusted on top.

For the lunch rush you need to be prepared!!!    They do have daily sushi specials (the Tsunami roll recently....uh a little 'tongue in cheek' guys?) and the Volcano Roll.  They will run you about 8 or 9 bucks per roll.  The rolls were put together so fast that they were sploppy and loose so it was hard to pick them up and dip them but overall not bad tasting....    The stir fry dishes are your MSG delight, portion sizes are ok and they come with an egg roll.",

We arrived at 930 to eat and were told the kitchen was closed and even though we had walked out of the way to eat there that they won't honor the groupon to go. Already I am completely discussed by the service and business all together.",

Fujo is tucked away in the Wachovia building downtown. The menu is huge you can try anything from one of their more exotic sushi rolls like the Cajun Roll - (Shrimp & Crawfish Inside: Topped w/ Spicy Crab and Cajun Spice) to authentic and tasty Chinese dishes like chicken with garlic sauce. The hardest part is choosing what to eat.   Did I mention that they serve my favorite wine here I haven't seen it in any other restaurant around yet...Sophia Coppola's sparkling white wine it's served in a little pink can. That just makes the experience that much better.   You never have to wait for a table and its a great place for a group dinner before heading out for some drinks uptown.",

Lots of office workers call in orders and then wait in the lobby for pickup.  This can cause the bar seating to feel a bit cramped, but normally its not bad.  The sushi chef is quiet and doesn't interact with customers much.  They always have plenty of staff on hand and they are friendly.  The lunch special rolls are small, but tasty.  The specialty maki rolls are much better (size and quality).  The pineapple fried rice is also very good.",

Being from the Bay Area, I was very nervous ordering Sushi here in the South, but there's only so much fried food you can eat before you want a bit of a lighter fare.    Now before you jump on me about all the awesome places with great healthy food, let me say that we had my 1 year old along for the trip and most restaurants don't particularly appreciate shrieking kids.   Our options were mostly limited to delivery, room service, and to go in the general vicinity of the Hilton Tower since we didn't have a car either...  *Anyway*, back to Fujo...   I ordered some Unagi Nigiri, a Magician Roll, a Philly Roll and a Spicy Salmon Roll.   That was tons of food and I came nowhere close to finishing it all (though damn if I didn't try really hard!) and it all tasted quite good.  My wife went with the Pad Thai since she's not a sushi lover... She very much enjoyed the food too.  Fujo's is a nice place to eat or pick up food, especially if you're staying at the Hilton Hotel in Uptown Charlotte.   You don't get more convenient than that!",

    "text": "What to say... Fujo is a \"historical\" uptown Charlotte restaurant now. Certainly that is a testament to their location and they must be doing something well. That said, I remember 10 years ago, their prices were better and their food was better. Over the years, I felt it has been a steady decline and it got to the point where I didn't eat there for almost two years, until today (2/29/2012). There are just so many \"pan-asian\", let me take some crap out of a bag, stir fry it, and charge you $10 for lunch places now in Charlotte, that Fujo doesn't distinguish itself.  I had the lo-mein, couldn't tell the difference from any other lo-mein. Someone in our party of 4 ordered the fried rice and it looked alot better than what I ordered. To be honest, if I wasn't so adverse to paying for fried \"leftover\" rice at \"Chinese\" restaurants, I would've gotten that, because it looked authentic.  FYI, fried rice is usually made from cooled / cold cooked rice. Some Chinese restaurants will use left over white rice to make fried rice, not sure what Fujo does, but I am always weary of ordering fried rice. Also, if the white rice that comes out doesn't look fresh and well cooked, what hope is there that your fried rice is remotely decent? Maybe I'm just snobby, but who goes to restaurants to pay for a meal of leftovers?  Anyways, ok food, nothing to write home about... forgettable pan-asian restaurant that you can find all over Charlotte now.",

    "text": "I have been a regular at Fujo's for lunch for several months now, dinner a couple of times.  I can say that they have consistently provided me with the best sushi experience in Uptown CLT.  First impressions; I've always been skeptical when a restaurant attempts to cross dress their cusine amongst several different cultures, and this place features Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc.  Places that do this will typically fall short of expectations in all categories when they don't specialize in just one.  This is not the case with Fujos!    Their sushi is fantastic...their lunch specials are reasonably priced for what you get.  I sat at the bar the other day and ordered the lunch special \"C\" (Cali roll, 3 salmon sashimi, 4 nigiri, chefs choice).  I fully expected the chef to pull a pre-made california roll out of the fridge; this seems to be common practice for other sushi joints who feature specials during lunch...they will pre-make rolls in anticipation of the lunch rush.  Not here.  The chef, who was flying solo during a busy lunch hour I might add, made every roll as it was ordered....a plus in my book, and something I will be glad to wait an extra couple of minutes for.    From the kitchen, might I suggest the Crab Fu Rong?  Delicious...of course, it is hard to screw up a crab!  Service is militarily efficient as well...if I ever had to wait in this place (which is seldom), it was on the kitchen, not on the waitstaff.  This place does fill up quickly during peak times...good news about the quality of the food, bad news for those of us with precious little free time during the workday.  Go a little before 12, or a little after 1, and you should be fine.",
