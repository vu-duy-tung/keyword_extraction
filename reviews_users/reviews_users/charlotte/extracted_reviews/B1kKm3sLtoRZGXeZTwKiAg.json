    "text": "I'm a native to the Ballantyne, Stonecrest and Blakeney area as decided to get a group of friends together for drinks last night. My group was late 20's early 30's, diverse, classy and well connected within the community. We showed up at about 9ish and the placed was rather crowded, found a table close to the bar by a Pillar and began to wait on drinks. We were met by a New Castle beer rep Shannon first which was, in complete honesty, much nicer than our waitress who took 30 minute before getting to us. She also immediately scolded the New Castle beer rep publicly for handing us free full-size samples since she won't be getting a tip for that. As more of my group began to show, the bouncers said we were too big and needed us to squeeze in as to not interrupt the wait staff from getting to their tables. Okay, I understand but the problem wasn't our group size, it was their location of the table we selected. If they properly placed tables, we wouldn't have blocked their staff. It is completely unacceptable to approach new customers in such a way as a new business in the area. We were hustled additionally 2 to 3 times to squeeze before I had to explain to the bouncer this is getting ridiculous, speaking to brand new customers like this..... Our waitress was slow, completely disoriented and really upset about having to remember our entire groups drink orders. I would suggest they invest in new staff training for larger customer groups. She was also clearly complaining to others on staff, enough that our entire group could tell and became uncomfortable, which is terrible for a business.  I want to be clear, I was embarrassed after gathering my friends to come out to this establishment and to be treated to way we were. My Review is solely based on service as that was my primary take away from the experience.",

The employees dont seem to care as long as they get tips. ALE has been there numerous times so be weary of when you are leaving the parking lot if you are intoxicated. Food is borderline disgusting, as I noticed my marinara sauce was cold and the steak tips were dangerously undercooked. Overall a trashy bar that was cool when it opened. Now it's full of rich white kids and their moms who hit on the kids friends. Check out char bar or hickory tavern. Won't be back.",

We did not like people standing around our table.  While we were there someone decided to raise the garage door type doors that opens one side of the bar up to the outside. This will be a nice feature when it is cooler outside but not when it is 95 degrees outside.  Immediately the entire place became so hot. We all had 1 drink and an appetizer then left.  Just a little too crowded, loud and hot for what we wanted that evening.  We will try this place again but definitely request a booth. Hoping to see this place do well.",

The crowd was definitely more men than women but makes sense as it has a sports bar feel. I have no problem with it has I enjoy watching sports. Prices seemed reasonable for beers and good daily specials. I had wings which were pretty good and really enjoyed their fries. My husband had the French dip which was delicious! The only thing was our bartender seemed a little absent but then again she had a large bar to deal with. All in all it was good experience and we can't wait to come check out the live music.",

    "text": "I was here last night for the last of a handful of times. It is not a big place, and on any given night it is pretty cluttered with tables. On Saturday, they not only have a cluttered, difficult-to-navigate bar, but then they add a band to the small space that they have, making it impossible to walk around, talk to anyone, or even order food or drinks because it's so loud. After a 20minute attempt to walk around the bar, we decided to just go out to the patio. We sat at an empty table and asked for menus. The girl brought them promptly back where we sat for nearly 20minutes with empty glasses and no one had come to find out what we wanted. The girl who brought us the menus sat, all the while, at the table next to us flirting with a pair of guys. It wasn't until we LITERALLY flagged someone down, that we finally got someone to take our order. We were told that management apparently leaves at 10 and the head bartender takes over controlling the restaurant after that. Well, they don't do a good job. She only made the excuse that \"oh, it's not her section, someone else should have helped you.\" That wasn't our problem. We ordered 2 appetizers, which came out quickly and tasted good, but still had to flag down the same girl every time we needed anything. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this bar, having never had a \"great\" experience to begin with. I won't be returning.",

C) My empty water cup sat there for a good 10 min while the bartender and server are hanging it with their friends bouncing a ball around gossiping and texting away on their phones.

One immediate turnoff was all of the cigarette smoking directly outside of the opened garage style doors that led to the inside of the joint. All of that secondhand smoke was just foul, and the worst part was watching the owner out there supporting it. The next issue I has was with the number of beers not available that evening. There were six beers that were on the menu, yet not available. As for the menu...it's typical bar food. That said, who pays $12 for wings?? The prices in this place are high. I'm not sure why the owner wouldn't have the insight to realize that when your appetizers (aka \"shared plates\") are the same price as your meals....they're too expensive!  I paid $9 for a plate of potato chips sprinkled with bleu cheese and bacon pieces. Nothing kept the toppings on the chips, so all I was doing was eating a plate of over-priced chips and spooning up the cheese and bacon. A bit of a loser, friends.",

    "text": "This review was originally posted 6/29/2013 but was somehow removed: Went early on a Tuesday night and felt like I was prepared for a casual bar type atmosphere with quality food.  Staff was very friendly and attentive, from the hostess to the waitress.  Cool design, however it becomes very loud as the entire place is made of concrete, metal, and stone.  Huge bar but a surprisingly small list of \"house\" drinks.  Now for the bad.  Order the shrimp quesadilla which had a few large shrimp with a very dry cheese, peppers, and onions. The filling was ok but should have used some kind of a \"melty\" cheese.  The problem was that instead of using a soft flour type of tortilla they used a hard shell type of tortilla.  Not good at all.  My wife had the spinach salad which was ok but the spinach wilted rapidly and the dressing was really thin.  The biggest problem was the \"deluxe burger\" for $13 I was expecting a juicy decent sized burger with bacon and cheese.  The roll was excellent however despite ordering my burger medium it came out very well which was strange as it had no sign of it being on a grill or flat top.  Just cool and grey.  Originally they brought out the burger with only a piece of lettuce on it and nothing else.  I told them it was not what I ordered and they brought back the same burger with just a squirt of mayo on it and lettuce.  Again I explained this is not what I ordered.  She brought back the same burger with a tiny piece of unmelted hard cheese and some sort of chopped up bacon topping.  They should have at least offered to make a new burger vs carrying the same cold overcooked burger back and forth three times.  It was maybe a quarter of an inch thick and clearly was not hand made.  School lunch burger on a great roll. I hope they figure it out but I doubt we will be back.",

    "text": "10 months from my original review.  Yes they have great beer selections.  NO they are not in stock (I'm not kidding - I went through 7 beer requests, only 4 were available and subpar - but more on that later). Plenty of TVs but almost all are playing the exact same thing.  Great cover bands - would love to see them anywhere else but here.  The food is still Eh. It's still Cougartown.  Still can't get a seat after 9pm.  Here's something new- my waitress to the shared table (thanks nice ladies for letting us sit with you) is a monster bitch with pupils the size of saucers and claims the beers are the same if made by the same brewery. When the heck is a Abbey Ale the same as an IPA? And why would would ask that I got 2 of them before realizing something was wrong?? Because the first few beers I asked for were drafts and the lines are dirty - which changes the flavor and makes everything sour. When I brought this to her attention, she gave me an attitude. Look sweetie, I get you're working hard to have your tables not to the bar but if you were more attentive and available to order from people would actually use your service.  Moving right along, since she was no help I went to the bar where a very nice bartender basically agreed the beer lines are dirty and that's the end of that. Fine - on to the manager. Nope not one of staff. But I did get to speak to a VERY Young looking \"owner\" who apologized for his staff being rude and asked what he could BUY ME after I explained 7 beers, only a few actually in stock and the drafts were nasty.  I don't want free stuff - I want a good tasting beer!!!! 3 attempts at this bar near my home and it's it. Not going back. I can find better beer and nicer service near my home elsewhere.  2 stars for the 2 bartenders who have tried to be helpful and apologetic who can't fix the problem but were nice, attentive and professional.",

    "text": "I like the place but I'm afraid to go back in a way which is sad. I used to go to that area a lot to salsa dance at Cosmos bc I am a professional dancer and instructor but Cosmos has long since closed down. The bouncers at Bradshaws were really nice and professional and so were the bartenders. However, I don't like to go to places where people try to start trouble with me for no reason. I went here last night to meet a friend and we were at the bar. One of the bartenders had her back turned towards us as she was performing her closing duties and counting money and so I politely said \"excuse me miss, can we order some drinks from you, well whenever you're done doing that bc I see your counting money so take your time.\" The bartender said \"sure!\" She finished that part of her duties and made us drinks and I thought all was good. However, a few mins later a guy comes right behind me and asks me how I got the bartender's attention. He asked me if I said \"excuse me miss or excuse me bitch\" smh, i immediately thought he was joking bc it just sounded funny, \"excuse me..bitch? Can we order drinks from you...\" so I laughed and made a DMX reference that I got from Kat Williams which is kind of popular like \"I'm Rick James bitch\" from the Chappelle Show. Little did I realize this guy was serious and was the bartender's bf and was trying to pick a fight with me in front of his friends to show he was tough or something. I get it, he was trying to defend her honor bc he thought I said \"excuse me bitch\" but the bouncer vouched for me and told him that I'm not the kind of guy that would say anything like that and his girlfriend even told him that I was very respectful in how I spoke to her and apologized to me. Yet this guy was still giving me evil looks and not trying to let it go. I was trying to appeal to his common sense like who says \"excuse me bitch\" to a bartender and expects to get service after that not to mention \"excuse me bitch, can we order some drinks from you, well whenever you're done doing that bc I see you're counting money right now so take your time.\" Smh lol..But this guy was really trying to be tough and didn't want to apologize for misunderstanding or anything. All I could think of was what happened in Greece recently, where I grew up where an African American from the USA was beaten to death for talking to a white bartender there and my guard was up and I was wondering if he and his friends were trying to do the same thing so I was thinking about trying to get to the trunk of my car in order to protect myself if need be. But yeah, I like the place but I'm guessing since he is her bf, he will be there a lot and I don't want to be places where there are people of that nature trying to start something with me for being polite and respectful and I end up getting hurt or hurting someone else bc I'm too old for that kind of drama. I've been telling my coworkers and students and friends about this incident and they are saying they don't want to ever go there now which is very unfortunate. But the bouncer that was there trying to diffuse the situation is the real MVP and I appreciate and commend him greatly.",

Not only was the Cucumber Martini the worse I've ever had - tasting like pure rubbing alcohol, the girl who served it was the nastiest person I've ever met! Not once was I checked on as I sat here for over an hour. I was given food with no offer of water to go along with it. After my bill was given to me and I expressed my concern - although my drank sat at the bar untouched for the entire hour - only then was it taken off my bill. Hate to say it but 2 thumbs down from.",

It took a little bit to get a waitress to take our order but once she did she was attentive for the rest of the night. Beers were good and reasonably priced.  Why am I writing this review? Because this is the first place from Ballantyne South on Rea (that whole corridor including Blakeney and Weddington) that actually has a vibe worth going to check out. Can you open another in the Fountains (corner of Tom Short and Audrey Kell)? Hint: The Stadium just closed its doors for good. (and I do mean \"for good\"). I enjoyed it - I felt like it was a happening place. I didn't feel it was an exclusive crowd (like Cosmos at night). I felt all ages of adults could hang out and enjoy the place.    We didn't order food so I can't comment. It was nice to get some quality tap beers and to have OMB Amber for $3.50 a pint is a nice option as well.  Finally ! An owner who understands what a sports bar is supposed to be. Now if only they could open another location that I can walk to.",

However, throughout the service things slowed down more than desired (the restaurant good busy).   My daughter got the chicken tenders, which were really good. However the fries had a odd flavor to them.   I ordered a French dip that was pretty good.   My wife ordered skillet melt without a bun. Unfortunately, we we received it there was now fried green tomato or aioli  we wanted this addressed, but our server didn't come by for another 30 minutes (see slow service above).   Lastly, my daughter asked for more lemonade which the server asked that we remove the lid and he'll come back and refill. That never occurred again because of the busy restaurant.    Overall, we likely will return only if we're in the area.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place since it's right down the street and nothing else like it is that close.  I really wanted to like it more but after our experience it was just a miss.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday night.  The main reason they aren't getting a better rating from me is their wait system.  They ask for your phone number and when your table is ready they call you.  This is a big problem since the place is so loud and unless you are looking at your phone constantly, you are going to miss the call just like I did.  We had a party of 6 so this added an hour to the hour we had already been waiting, which is why I'm giving this rating.  I would advise them to invest in some pagers like other places or any other system that makes better sense than phone calls you can't hear.  We were also standing right in front of the hostess desk so it wouldn't have been hard for them to see the 6 of us and ask if we were such and such party.  They were also not very apologetic once I mentioned the issue to them.    When we finally did get seated our waitress was very nice and attentive and the food was decent but nothing to write home about.  As another reviewer posted, most of the tables are the high ones and only some of them have backs.  It was also very loud and I barely had a voice once we left.  I think this would be a decent place for a couple of people to go and have a drink and not interested in carrying on a conversation, but not sure I would go back for dinner.  There are other places in Ballantyne (sports bars) that I would go to before going here again.",

The reason for the 1 star review was the \"industry standard burger\" I ordered.  A 14 dollar bison burger that came cooked to the wrong temperature and was heavily salted to the point it was inedible.  The person I was dining with also had the same problem with their burger.  We didn't finish our meals ands sent both back.  To make the experience even less enjoyable the now rude waitress informed us that no salt had been added and the would not be comped, but hey we got 5 bucks back.  Of course it took 20 minutes to finally get the check and leave.  Will not return.  Save yourself the trouble and go to Duckworth`s instead better beer and food.",

I get it -it's slow - but if you have a table, I really recommend refilling drinks and asking how the food is before engaging in chatter with your coworkers & bouncing balls around.   We were one of two tables - the other table seemed to be somewhat attended to. We waited ten minutes to get water refilled and am currently waiting for my check. Funny how this place is less than a mile from my office but I can't see to squeeze in lunch without racing back to the office because my hour long break has only three minutes left.

Located at Village at Robinson Farm just past the intersection of Rea Rd and Ballantyne Commons (same strip as The Meat House, Cosmos and Hawthorne's), this is definitely one-of-a-kind in the area for local places.  Lots of TV's, mostly high top tables and a large bar with LOTS of beer choices, this is a place for games and to hang out.  Finished concrete floors and high ceilings give this an unfinished vibe, but it's quite nice.  There is quite a bit of outdoor seating and 2 large roll-up doors for when it's not blazing hot out with summer storms rolling through.    If you have a fat ass, the low tables with metal chairs are not going to be comfortable (the chairs are comfy to sit in, but the arms will squeeze your booty).  The hostess tried to steer me to a high top table, which 80% of the restaurant is, but I had on a skirt and I hate high top tables.  They have a few booths as well, but those look like they are for larger parties, and I hate taking those up when it's just me.  For food, after looking at their menu on their Facebook page (they only opened up last week and their website is still under construction), I wanted the Skillet Melt, but the friendly, lovely young lady that was waiting on me said that was one of the 2 things they didn't have today (because that's how I roll).  I asked what she liked and she said the Prime Rib Dip ($11), so we went with that with a side of sweet potato fries.  I read somewhere, either on their FB page or one of the write-ups, that they use bread from Nova's Bakery - it's always nice to see locally sourced stuff on a menu.  The sammich was fine.  It was a little light on meat, the onions were cooked well on it, and the cheese was barely noticeable. The bread was good, but the way it is domed makes the middle of the sandwich thick with bread - so with the combo of little meat and thick bread, it was like I was eating a bread sandwich.  But the meat was flavored well.  The sweet potato fries were a little bigger than shoestring and were fine, again nothing unusual.    The restaurant itself is a very neat concept, well needed in this area.  Great execution.  There were a lot of smiling faces - the waitresses were lovely and there were a few young buff gentlemen pitching in as well, so everyone should be happy with the scenery.  If you are drinker, I am thinking you need to get over here ASAP to try it out.  I may have ordered the wrong thing, so I will be back to try it again once they are open for a bit and get in the groove.",

As my group was sitting outside, we witnessed someone get taken away in an ambulance. They either drank too much or got into a fight, I honestly have no idea what happened to them.  After we watched this person get taken away, one of the \"victims\" friends came to our table and go off on a person in our group.   Apparently she didn't like they were watching.  It was a pretty strange/awkward/unnerving situation.  I hadn't seen something like this since college, and this wasn't a college crowd. Security was required to remove this individual from our table. She wasn't kicked out and just moved to another spot in the bar, which was pretty close to us still and began to talk to others in bar about us. She may have been a regular, I don't know. Again, awkward. My wife and I left the bar immediately at this point.   Again, it's doubtful we will ever be back.    The food is solid and they have decent beers, but the majority of people that frequent the bar are very far from my preferred crowd.  No thanks.",

The Turkey with avocado was so blend and tasteless, dry as my hair, and in desperate need of some kind of sauce to hide the earthy taste of the sprouts on it. My Asian sesame salad was boring, and not a sesame seed in sight, as it says on menu. The dressing was typical Asian, almost teriyaki-ish and salty as hell, which now started the swelling of my fingers. I miss the usual bar menu of chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks.

This place on a Wednesday, Thursday for live band kareoke, Friday or Saturday night with honestly fantastic live music, I'm talking after 9, 10 pm turns into an awesome night club atmosphere for the over 30+(Might be more toward 40+) crowd.

The pretzel was obviously warmed up in the microwave and tasted a week old. I will not be going back for any type of food. Wait staff so super awesome and friendly.  If you want a good pretzel and beer cheese, head to Old Mecklenburg  Brewery. None better!!!",

    "text": "Tried out this new and already very popular restaurant last Friday. We went in early-ish  (6 to me is early) and found the place packed. We got the last seats in the house before they went on a wait.  As others have noted, there are a lot of tall tops, but we sat at one of the few tables behind the wall at the entrance. I will agree that any of us who find we carry weight in our hips/thighs could find these seats pretty uncomfortable. I was good to go, thankfully, but I can see where if I were up just another size or two it would be painful, and that would be embarrassing. I wonder how long they'll keep those chairs.  Our server was incredibly attentive, professional and helpful. Five stars for service. I didn't see anyone wanting/waiting for anything while we were there.  The food was okay. Not fantastic, but it's a bar essentially, so you get decent quality bar food. As it was still Happy Hour we ordered half price appetizers - chips and salsa and hummus. The chips and salsa were just sad. A tiny cup of salsa, and a handful or so of chips on a plate. Not worth the money, even at half price, certainly nothing special. The hummus was delicious and served with pita, carrots and celery.  My husband ordered the steak tips, and was disappointed by the blandness of the rice. It would be better served with mashed potatoes rather than just a formed mound of white rice with no flavor. (I don't like rice, to me it has no flavor anyway, but my husband fixes and devours a lot of it and even he pronounced it \"incredibly bland\" as he reached for the salt shaker.)   Oh, a word about the shakers... Pour the salt in your hands first. They have a ton of holes and you'll get a bucket of salt dumped on your meal if you just shake from it.  I tried the fish sandwich and pretty much just ate it like fish and chips, because it was less food and cheaper than the fish and chips and I didn't have a huge appetite after the appetizers. My meal was solid.  The biggest problem we have with this restaurant is visiting during the heat of the summer. It was 85+ degrees outside, and with that awesome cool garage door set up opened, it was very hot and stuffy inside. There were no fans anywhere near our tables. I saw one small set of fans over the bar area, but that's it.   Here in Charlotte, in the summer, you can either go for cool air conditioning or sweltering \"ambiance\" you can't have both. They need to keep that door closed and the restaurant air conditioned in the summer.  It sounds like I hate this place. Really, I don't. The restaurant is new, but it has great potential. Clearly they hired good servers, and they're trying this whole menu for the first time so I'm sure there will be changes.  We will be back to BSH sometime, but with those garage doors and the heat issues inside the restaurant, we probably won't return until the fall.",

The last time I brought her we sat ourselves, were given menus and the waiter came up right away and kind of grunted at us \"what do you want?\". It was obviously off-putting and I asked for a minute with the drink menu and he pointed at the menu in front of us. When he came back he seemed to be slightly more enthusiastic. I tried to ordered the blended drink on the menu but he said the blender was broken which everyone knows means nobody feels like washing the blender. I ordered a well drink and my friend ordered the mule. The menu says it comes in a copper mug but he brought it in glass. When asked why the waiter told us they stopped using them because they were getting stolen. The menu also had a bunch of fall beers listed in the draft list but it was May. Checking out took a really long time too. Something else that bothers me about this place is that nobody ever writes down your order and we've had mistakes in the past. Very disappointing :( it feels like literally nobody in there cares.",

Awesome service by the way and she was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations on food and drinks. Our food was excellent and we definitely got our money's worth!      Now comes the beer! HUGE disappointment! While they have a great selection of draft beer, their tap or cooling system needs some major work. Beer was barely cold and on the verge of being room temperature.

Twenty minutes later she brought our appetizer out. We could see our main order was up but she decided to wait so we could enjoy our barely warm fried pickles. We had to flag down another server to get our drinks refilled. So another ten minutes go by and she brings our food over which also was barely warm. Fries got soggy and were not eatable. We could see her most of the time with her face buried in her phone. It was the middle of the day and they were not busy. We probably won't be back after the lackluster service.",

The waitress, Rachel, was very polite and accommodating to turn on the game prior to tip off. Comfortable seats. Nice TV angles from any location.  We ordered the barbecue wings bourbon style. They had a nice char on them. The french fries were average. The nachos could've used more toppings, very little salsa and lettuce and tomato.  They had decent beer specials. Running about $2.50 for cans, and $3.50 for local drafts The pretzel bread had good cheese, but the bread itself was only ordinary.  There was a band scheduled to play at 10 PM, but nice to see the management decided to complete the Hornets game prior to letting them start up.  I know the reviews here were hit or mess. This is a nice unique place if you want a break from Hickory Tavern or other said sports bars. It's  more of an upscale crowd I would say. A lot of cougars coming in after 10 PM.",

He handed us free membership cards explaining next time to show it as we entered. The bar looked very nice, we had one drink and left. We were put off by an establishment taking our information, wonder who they will sell it to.",

I honestly couldn't tell much difference between the two; they were just so.. bland. We then ordered the pretzels with beer cheese because how could you mess that up? Congeal the cheese, that's how.  As we left at 7:30, they were setting up for live music. We were the youngest people in there by a good 10 years, and we're in our mid-30s, so I'd say it's a big of an older, cougar-ish clientele, at least on a Monday night. At least our service was good.  I've given it the old college try, but I'm done trying.",

    "text": "If it wasn't for the bartender acting bothered that we came in on a very slow afternoon (there were maybe 10 people in the place) I would give more stars. I like the atmosphere - great place to hang out with friends, watch games. Bartendress was busy unloading a shipment that was dropped off and chatting with other staff who seemed to be off duty. Had to wait and wait for her to come around our side of the bar after the food was dropped to request a couple items. Really no excuse for poor service and an attitude to boot. Hopefully management reads the many reviews echoing this sentiment and cleans house a bit.   The food was unimpressive. I had a \"quinoa\" veggie burger that is reportedly made in-house. I couldn't identify any quinoa in it, but rather it had the texture of a bean burger - mushy and cat food-like. Fries are amazing - hand cut, cooked perfectly. Hubs had chicken wings finished on the grill. He said not bad, but wasn't raving.  There was nobody on the patio, as it was mid afternoon and cold outside, so I can't speak to that. What I've read says they allow smoking out there so that would be a no-go for me. It's a pet peeve having lived in Las Vegas most of my life when bars/restaurants in other States allow smoking anywhere near the establishment. Personally,I find the smell extremely offensive and do not wish to be subjected to smoke in order to enjoy the outdoors. I can't think of any reason why smokers can't have a designated smoking area away from patrons who are drinking and eating and trying to breath oxygen. I guess places like this are hoping to attract smokers? Maybe they drink more? Idk.",

We had the dozen wings (typical bar food that tasted just fine) / cheese steak egg rolls (first time I has them anywhere and loved it. It has a nice balance of cheese and meat wrapped by the standard egg roll wrap) / Ribs were amazing! Our waitress described it as a specialty since the chefs used to own a BBQ place. I can see why she called it out.  I will certainly come back again.",

    "text": "As a restaurant manager... I would never step foot back in this establishment. The children's beverages came after bar drinks. The \"no tomato with an allergy\" was ignored... Macaroni side was hard and cold. All of these things were pushed aside because as restaurant managers we understand that things do happen especially with a later crowd. But in 15 years of the industry I have never been disappointed enough to write a bad review....   Ashley, the manager, so I was told did not leave behind the bar. Liz... Our server... Should not be. And i fully regret the tip we left her. She brought our tab which I gave her a debit card for... 20 dollar cash tip which I informed her the cash was hers and the card was for the tip. Our friends decided to have one more beer and I kindly asked if we could have one beer and one shot seperate from the prior transaction and gave her a 20. She tried to keep 40 and charged our card 78...   As a manager... I fully understand confusions... Stupid comps... If you're in the weeds... If you just don't know. Or if you had given even half of an apology when we asked about our check once you attempted to pocket 40 dollars on a 78 dollar check... Which should not have even been 78 on the card. If you were a decent honest employee... Our table would have easily left you 100 percent of the bill altogether. We still left 50 percent and we should not have.   Also... I'm sure your managers are fully aware that the 5 of us will tell how awful our experience was tonight... And everyone we tell... will tell multiple other people. So there will be 2 restaurants with 80 plus employees and 5 guests of your restaurant that will not step foot in there because you have one employee who tried to pocket 40 dollars when she was already tipped 20 on a 67 dollar check and 17 on a 60 dollar check...",

I've been 3 times and the same group of older guys are there at the bar (patrons) and if you're within an earshot, one or all of them will make comments about what you're ordering or eating or watching, etc. I didn't go to the bathroom because I thought one of them would ask me how it went. I'm not kidding. They mean no harm, but jeez, they take \"social house\" to an all-time annoying level. This is not the place to go for a quick, decent meal and a drink. It's trying too hard versus just doing the basics extremely well. And, tell those guys at the bar to quit it.",

We politely rejected in giving that info so they said it would be a $2.00 cover charge. I was like WTF! All we wanted to do is go to the bar to drink but they would not let us enter. It's really not the $2.00,  Now I had been to this spot at least 2 times prior a year or so ago.

Sometimes you just gotta humble yourself and enjoy the flavor without the fuss..You can't expect Chick-fil-a service at McDonald's right?  Right!

What I got, when I opened the food at home was a burger with tots and fried wings. No stupid hot sauce, no blue cheese, no celery which comes automatically. Not sure what the hell happens between the order, the kitchen and the bartender's delivery of the order, but validating order fulfillment is not part of the process.
