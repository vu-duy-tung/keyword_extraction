    "text": "People- All nice, friendly and courteous.  Jumbo Cheeseburger (Same as Superboy, but w/cheese). For the money, it was what I expected. Far better then any 'fast food burger', yet not as good as burger from True sit down restaurant. However, it's quality and price go hand in hand with the above comparison. While better then any fast food burger, its also accordingly/justifiably more expensive. While not as good as a sit down/non fast food restaurant burger, its according/justifiably cheaper. Very good burger for the price. Not worth a long drive/go out of your way type burger, as plenty of others are as good or better likely close by wherever you are. If your close by, go grab one, you should enjoy it.  Hot dog- with Chili slaw and mustard. Not the best, not the worst, but a very good dog at a very reasonable $2.   Fried Chicken - Was expecting more based on the reviews. I was not impressed however. Pretty bland tasting. But for me, the big downer was it was quite dry. I didn't try the dark meat, dark meat is always more tender/juicier, so perhaps it is better. The white meat was far too dry and tasteless.  Grilled Cheese - Big disappointment. Most 'normal' Grilled Cheese have 2 slices. While I didn't see them cook it and didn't count the slices, it was pretty obvious it was only 1 slice. It was basically mostly 2 pieces of toast with very little cheese. So little, the only thing you tasted was the toast. For a little less then $3, its not worth it unless you want to pay that much for 2 pieces of toast. Furthermore, right off the grill, its put on to a Styrofoam plate that melted. C'mon guys, why not a small paper plate instead?  Hamburger Steak and Fries. Enjoyed them both. Again, nothing earth shattering or worth going out of your way for, but good and tasty at a reasonable price.  Onion Rings - My biggest disappointment, especially seeing the reviews. The portion size was extremely small. Very small, and not cheap by any means. I could live with that however if they were as good as the reviews suggest. I can't argue much since I am in the obvious minority, as the majority of reviewers, love them. My experience was they were way overpriced for such a small portion & they had no taste at all. Added salt, no help. Completely tasteless. The batter was bland and if I closed my eyes and didn't know what I was eating, I would never guess 'onion rings'. I will however say, they were the crunchiest rings I've ever had, almost too crunchy. Additionally, they were the 'least greasy' rings I've ever had. Normally that would be a very good thing as its hard to find onion rings that are not overly greasy and sort of soft. In this case, I would rather have them be a bit more greasy with a bit less crunch if it added to the taste.  Lastly, I've never eaten inside. Always takeout. I do like the separate area for 'To Go' orders. I've never called in an order as I prefer to ensure I'm getting my food hot and fresh. Each order has been about the same. Maybe 5-7 minutes at the most before your out the door with everything in nice sturdy boxes. Upon getting home and eating, everything was still nice and warm.  In conclusion, if your in the area, stop in and give it a try. I will be back myself. I will stick with the very good fries over the onion rings next time and will try the dark meat chicken as well. Furthermore, I would happily eat the Burgers, Hot Dogs and Hamburger Steak but will avoid the grilled cheese unless they decide to actually put some cheese on it and considering they have been around awhile I am a tad confused how a place that specializes in hot fried food is using Styrofoam to put the hot fried foods in, but in the future I will ask for specific foods to either be put in to a different container if that's an option, if not, then I'm sure they can use a piece of the opaque paper wraps on the bottom to separate the hot fried food from the Styrofoam, and are a little baffled why they don't already do this.  All in all, good, fresh, reasonably priced food, nice people. Most would enjoy South 21 so give it a try next time your close by.",

    "text": "We love the fried chicken here as I can't say I have had any better at any other restaurant. No, it's not seasoned to the gills like some are. They have salt and pepper on the table if that is what you want and hot sauce if you ask. The chicken though is so well cooked and wasn't dripping in grease as so many other places are. It was allowed to drain properly. Also, I can't even begin to explain just how juicy the chicken was. As soon as you bit into it the juices would just flow. So tender and delectable. The sweet ice tea was just right. Not to sweet but right on the money made with that type of crushed ice that most just love to crunch on.The fries are just fries and the slaw, well, slaw but they ain't what everybody is there for. It's all about the chicken Ya'll.   ;-)",

    "text": "I'm a big cheeseburger fan.  I am always seeking out a great burger.  South 21's Super Boy fits that bill for me.    When you first walk into this place, you're thrown back to the good old days.  The checkered floor, red seats and chrome accents all add to the appeal, IMO.  I've only ever had the Super Boy here, and to me it lives up to it's name.  Two nice beef patties, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onions on a nice fresh bun with a side of golden fries.  Wash it down with a nice cold Coke and it's hard to beat for a $6 lunch.   I'm sorry I can't review anything else on the menu, I've been to South 21 5 or 6 times and love the Super Boy so much that I can't order anything else!  (I have actually tasted the onion rings here and they're quite good too!)  I recommend that if you like a good old fashioned American classic cheeseburger and you're in the area, give South 21 a try.  You won't likely be disappointed!",

Food is consistently good and did I tell you about the onion rings? I've tried just about everything on the menu and never been disappointed and always order the onion rings with ever meal. They have a 50-60s car theme going on and this location used to have a classic car meet that they had to end for some reason (I'm assuming because of the mega church that takes over the entire parking lot and they are mega jerks about it too). If you wish to eat here on a Friday or Saturday night be warned you need to get here before 6pm or you will have a heck of a time trying to find a seat. They do offer carry out service that is very fast and you get it in a snazzy box, along with carry out they have call ahead that you can pick up from a drive-thru window (you must call ahead to use the drive-thru)  I have 2 cons 1. The coleslaw is not sweet it is vinegar based, I was shocked since this is the south and they love their sugar down here. 2. They are open till 9 but shut the grill off at 7:45. I've actually been quite upset about this one. There is absolutely no reason to shut a grill down an hour before you close. If you want to be open till 9 your grill should be running until at least 20mins before close otherwise you might as well close at 8.",

It's essentially a 50's diner before folks got into the low-fat, no trans fat, reduced fat hoopla.  But did I mention the food is made to order?    The burgers are thin, but charbroiled.  Get the Superboy for $4.  Its double meat, cheese, and toppings. Also, they have daily specials for $5, like fried chicken, trout, hamburger steak with fries/onion rings, and a drink.  You can't go wrong with their specials.    I highly recommended  South 21 for residents and visitors in Charlotte/Matthews.  The cashiers are friendly, service is fast, and its family friendly.  Distinctly Southern in service, vintage in decor, and top-notch in flavor.  Ya'll go get check it out, ya hear?",

I ordered the Super Boy with cheese and French fries, and I'd have to say, this is probably the best burger that I've had so far in my life. The meat was juicy and tasteful, the bun was toasted, I asked for grilled onions, which were cooked perfectly and topped it off with lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mustard. The French fries that come with it, were cooked perfectly. I ordered a sweet tea to wash everything down, and the tea was perfectly sweetened. I considers ordering the onions rings, but I didn't, since I didn't know if I would eat everything, and I'm glad that I didn't, becayse I was FULL after the burger and French fries. Lol. Overall, this is a place that you should try at least once if you're ever in Charlotte, NC. You may end up becoming a regular, like I plan to. No complaints at all!",

There just isn't many good options, however South 21 has become one of my favorites for lunch!  Imagine greasy, old diner with a very local feel.  It's cheap and yummy which is all you need to know!  Oh, and they also have pellet ice which who doesn't love that?!  If you hit the lunch rush, you may end up waiting for a table so plan accordingly.  I recommend onion rings over fries.  Their lettuce is crisp and tomatoes are red.  I AM OBSESSED.  Anytime I am craving a traditional good ole burger, I go here.  If you need to take a break from the burger, the BLT is a classic choice as well.  Family owned and a Charlotte staple.  Worth a stop, always.",

They said it would take 10-15 minutes. I got there right on time and started eating in the car. The burgers were already cold. The lettuce was watery and tomato was bad. The lettuce water made the bun wet and mushy. The meat was cold. They forgot to put mustard on them too. The fries were cold and soggy. The potato salad was awful. The milkshakes weren't very good either. I prefer 5 guys, bad daddy's or zacks hamburgers.",

It's your stereotypical burger joint with all of the American fare you can find yourself wanting.  Known for their trademarked \"Super Boy,\" I had to oblige on my first visit. Sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomato, two flat-grilled beef patties, onions, mustard, and pickles. No cockamamie or gimmicky \"special sauce.\" Just mustard. It's a True, blue American style burger. I can't say it's the best burger I've ever had, but for what South 21 stands for, chalk me up as a believer. I'll drink the kool aid any day when it comes to the super boy.   The rest of the  menu is plain. Simple. Great for kids.  Now, this location isn't my favorite. It's on the other side of the earth off of Independence....which is never anyone's favorite road to traverse. I'd definitely come back if we were to visit with friends, children in tow, and in the area. Would I drive all the way from Uptown for a Super Boy? Probably not. I'll hit the drive-in closer to town.   Glad I got to check out this location!",

Seating is a bit different situation - I felt like the new kid in the middle school cafeteria with everyone looking at me as I panic to find a non existent open table for my family.  Table area inside is small considering the large amount of business that they get.  Outside tables are available too, but who wants to sit outside during a muggy July evening?   I ordered the fried trout platter for my meal.  Ive had burgers here before and they are good.  However,  I cant believe more people don't rave about this option.  DELICIOUSNESS is not enough of a description for this wonderful dish. Fish was fried but batter was not overbearing and the fish tastes fresh, served with homemade tartar sauce that was good.  Meal comes with a vinegar based cole slaw (not my favorite), fries were good, also served with a roll.    Food came out very fast.  This is the place to come for diner-esque, comfort, good food!",

Mr T had the Chef Salad - and what a great salad it was. I'm upset with myself because I forgot to order my must-have side of their awesome Greek-style slaw.  As a side note, noticeably missing was the young man that has worked there for years, and recently moved away from the area. What an asset he was to South 21, and he is greatly missed.  Update 7/18/18: National Hot Dog day, and I had to get one at South-21.  They have one of the best hot dogs around. While there, I picked up a to-go order of fried chicken with their wonderful vinegar-based slaw and onion rings instead of fries.",

Three Greek immigrant brothers put the original location together on South Boulevard in about 1955 and opened this Independence Boulevard location later.    Good food, reasonable prices, clean with good service the only problem is finding it along the insane bustle of Independence Blvd.  It is back from the road and easy to miss, so keep your eyes peeled.  Good parking lot.  We rarely go into businesses on Independence, but when I take my car to the BMW dealer this is a place for breakfast and/or lunch.  Burgers, sandwiches, plates, fried chicken, fried shrimp and even trout!  A surprise.  All the food is quality and good portions.  Fries are made to order and are burn your mouth hot when you get your plate.  I like the Super Boy double burger that comes with fries.  Wife had fried chicken and really liked it.  She was hesitant to come with me, but ended up saying that she would come back.  I, also.",

I dont think I have gone there once when their wasnt a line. The cool thing about that though is that they move people pretty fast through the line once you get there. The atmosphere immediately give you an old diner feel. The menu isn't complicated and does not try to be something that it isnt. Im sure if you asked around you could probably find people who have been coming there since it opened. It is a bit of a staple for Matthews although I feel like it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The food is great on multiple occasions I have had their burgers but started trying their chicken sandwich and it is equally as good. My only suggestion would be to get longer fries or crinkle cuts.

The lady saw it, then wanted to be rude as can be and ask my order 1000 times after asking me what my problem was. You looked me in my face when they did it. You just wanted to add to my horrible experience with this place. I was waiting on togo the bus boy wouldn't stop staring at me, so i said where am I supposed to stand then. The tall darker guy said you can go have a seat. Im on my lunch break i replied, with him saying well you cant stand right here go have a seat maam. I will never be back here again, you gave me no ketchup utensils or any napkins. And the three onion rings I got were ice cold. Thanks for a really crappy lumch.",

    "text": "South 21 is pretty much an institution in this area.  If you've been once, you know what you're going to get, because it's one of the most consistent restaurant experiences around. Whether you go to this location in Matthews, the original drive-in, or South 21 Jr. on Tryon, your favorite will be the same each and every time.   My personal favorites are the Jumbo Cheeseburger and the Fried Trout, and I get one of the two 99% of the time. But when I've branched out in the past, I've also really enjoyed the chicken, both fried and grilled, as well as the ribeye steak sandwich.   This past visit I decided to try the chicken tenders, hoping and kinda assuming they would use the same breading that they use for the trout or the fried chicken. It isn't the same, and it almost seemed like they may have come in frozen. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't majorly disappointing. But after I got past that, they were still pretty tasty, and I think they were even better cold the next day. Overall, I'd skip them if you want the best South 21 has to offer, but they're fine if you have a little one who's a fan of tenders.   Onion rings! So good, they get their own section. They leave the seasoning up to you, so they might seem bland at first if you don't hit em with a little salt. But the truth is, it's all about that breading. So thick, so crunchy. I don't know exactly what they use, but they are some of the only rings I know that keep their crunch completely even after sitting in the fridge all night long. If you only try one thing, make it the rings.   So to sum up: Jumbo Cheeseburger. Trout. Onion Rings! Yum.",
