    "text": "Pinky's has awesome food, great prices and unprofessional, unpleasant service. Ive been embarrassed to bring my friends and family here because the service  is some of the worst I've ever experienced. And it's consistent. I'll get to the positive first. The food is fantastic, it's simple and humble but everything I've had is delicious. Especially as a vegetarian, Pinky's has tons of options that you can't usually find at other restaurants. Their veggie burger is great but my go to is the Stray Dog, a sweet potato hot dog with vegetarian chili, onions and slaw. It is SO good, it's been a long time since I've had a real hot dog but I'm pretty sure the Stray Dog tastes just like the real thing. Also for sides, their red potato salad is great, so are their potato chips. The entire menu is really affordable as well, with a meal with sides usually coming to around $10. But all is not well. I've been coming to Pinky's to eat for a couple years now, ignoring the subpar and unfriendly service that I just deemed to be expected from Pinky's. The food and atmosphere made up for it. But I just can't do it anymore. I'm sure I'll eat Pinkys again in the future but it will have to be To-go. The servers are so consistently rude and inefficient that I just don't want to leave another lunch or dinner feeling worse than when I came in. It's as if it's an employment requirement that you must appear disinterested and annoyed at all times. Servers have a permanent scowl and they make the dining experience uncomfortable for me and my party time and time again. Just today I was having lunch with my sister when a larger, older, red haired female server brought our fried pickles out. We had just ordered and finished another order of fried pickles previously but ordered a second. When she put it down I asked if we could please get another two ranches for the pickles. She LITERALLY rolled her eyes and cut me off to say \"they're .75\" i politely explained to her that I never received any ranch to go with my second order and she walked off while I was talking I was slightly stunned because she was so abrasively rude when I was just making a simple request. I have been a server myself for years and the way the majority of the servers here are is laughable. Lastly, I dropped my debit card on the ground and my sister put it on the table for me. a waiter walked by and interrupted my conversation to say \"is that you prompting me to take my payment??\" And pointed at my card. I was SO shocked and embarrassed that he would be so confrontational to me. I said \"no, I just dropped it on the floor and picked it up but I'm ready for the check now if it's convenient\" and he walked away with out saying anything. As a server if my table had a card out on their table i would simply ask \"are you ready for your check?\" He was so nasty and unfriendly for NO reason. It's maddening the way that no care is paid to service here at pinky's, napkins and sauces are often forgotten as well and drinks are left to go empty. I wish I could just not be a patron of theirs at all but the food is just too good.",

The Westside randy was the best of the bunch.    The beer list was completely off on my most recent visit.  Why have a laminated beer list if you're out of everything on the list?  Seems like a waste of money to me when just a regular paper list would be easier to reprint and cheaper. But oh well.    Service is ok here. Nothing exceptional. They take your order, tell you they are out of the first 3 beers you selected, and they bring your food out.    At the lack of parking doesn't make this place somewhere I want to visit often.  I actually preferred the Huntersville location which I also visited recently.",

She came to the table and said \"was something wrong with the veggie dog?\" And I said I'm sorry I just didn't care for it.

I debated only writing that because any place that serves this delicious dish always has my heart.... so naturally I'm going to tell you to order fried pickles...but wait there's more!!!  Pinky's is an awesome little burger joint and you can't go wrong with any thing you order. The white trash burger is golden and of course it has fried pickles on it!!!!!!!   If you're trying to be healthier go for the tahini salad. It's delicious and the falafel is cooked perfect.   Also this is a great little late night place to avoid the uptown rush- cocktails are $5-7 and they're huge. Most of them are served in a mason jar. You can also upgrade to a double for a few bucks extra. Ps. The Squirrely temple is great!!!!",

Still one of my favorite places...the husband, kiddo and I usually hit it up sometime on Sunday (we call it \"the Holy Church of Pinky's\", since we usually make it here instead of church - ha!).   We've had some rough experiences lately though...bringing a toddler out anywhere is super stressful at times and the wait staff can make or break it. The wait staff has been in transition lately and we had stopped going in lieu of a chain restaurant with an extensive kids menu and wait staff that liked our kid.   When the little man first started eating solid foods, the wait staff gave their recommendations on how to order stuff to get the best deal on a smaller portion, because he's two and two year old's just don't eat all that much.  But, then, that staff left and the newbies didn't know what we were talking about when we asked for a \"side of fried chicken\" or a \"kids burger\". They'd let us wait just a little too long for food/drinks, or not bring little man's food in a timely manner (gotta expedite the kids meals), plus weren't friendly...it was too much and we stopped going.  Decided to give our favorite place another try this last week and had a GREAT experience. Still got our least favorite waitress, but she has really picked up the pace and gave us a much, much better level of service than we had come to expect from her.  The service makes such a big difference.  Looking forward to an even better experience next week!",

Only minor complaint: I ordered fries and the waitress forgot but she later gave them to me to go and didn't charge. So Win Win!    My second visit was the next day because I forgot my credit card and had to go back to get it.  It was around noon again so very crowded but I got a seat at the bar and had the mammoth burger and fried squash.  The burger WAS mammoth and delicious.  Not greasy but very moist.  Excellent burger and I consider myself a burger aficionado so when I say it's excellent we're talking top 10 burger here.    But the best thing was the fried squash.    Each one was like a little piece of southern culinary heaven.  Golden fried and crisp with a slightly sweet salty taste.  And there were so many that try as I might (and believe me did) I could not finish them all.    If you have never been to Pinky's get yourself there.  I envy you your first taste of Pinky's deliciousness.",

    "text": "Really excellent burger and a 5 star corn dog.  Really outstanding corn dog!  I'm saying it twice because I would not have expected it to be so dang good based on corn dogs sampled at other restaurants.  Did not have the french fries, so no comment on them.  Onion rings while ok, were not in the same league as the burger or cd.  I think a thicker ring would have worked much better.  I should have had a 2nd corn dog instead of the rings.  Burger was a single because of the addition of the corn dog.  The doubles and triples looked outstanding and I would expect just that much more delish-i-ness (?) by adding more patties and cheese.  Hats off to the cooks!  Bartenders are attentive and I was never thirsty.  Muchas gracias!  I may have been the only non-tattooed person in the place, but no issue with that whatsoever.  Everyone seems like really nice peeps.  Great music.  Too many IPA's for my taste and would have liked a nice micro-brewed lager, but ended up drinking PBR's which were just fine with the excellent burgers and cd's.  Only 4 stars due to the onion rings, but y'all are doing great things...",

This place is super unique - decor is funky and fun - the outside patio is perfect for a tasty meal on an nice day.  The service is fantastic.They wait on you as a group so you always have someone the to constantly check in. You'll never have to ask for a refill - the fill you up before you can even realize what's going on.  The \"Westside\" burger is delicious - mustard, chili, slaw & onion!? \"I put that sh** on everything\"  The Grilled Greek Pita w/ chicken is my go to sandwich. I almost wish there was more chicken put into it, with it being so good.  Nonetheless, the food is very good, the atmosphere is fun and it is always completely packed during lunch hours (always a good sign).  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Like Jules, I'm glad I waited to give a review for Pinky's.  My boyfriend & I had gotten take out, I'd say early last year & I got some kind of burger and the slaw.  I was not happy at all. I ended up feeling sick on my stomach afterwards.    Fast forward to yesterday, when I was in an extreme rush, hurrying from one appointment to another.  It was after 1 PM & the lunch rush had died down, thank goodness. I needed the order to go & was immediately helped by a friendly waitress. Like Dion alluded to, the decor inside is fun & hip, & they had some jamming music playing.  Everything looked clean.  I got the Pterodactyl burger with \"everything\" - mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickles, along with the (waffle) french fries & a sprite. Luckily, my food came out in about five minutes & I was on my way.  I nommed away on my fries along Morehead and onto South Blvd. They were tasty! They were lightly salted & light - they weren't heavy like Chic-Fil-a's waffle fries.  Once I got to my second appointment, I dove into my hamburger. OH M GEE, it was delicious! It didn't seem heavy either! The toppings were fresh & thankfully, the onion wasn't too overpowering. The burger was juicy & cooked to perfection.  The cons: parking is limited on site. You're probably going to end up parking across the street where the tattoo parlor is - & even there, parking isn't great.  The restaurant  itself isn't too big either, so seating could be an issue. Ha! I have to agree with Jimmy - this IS NOT the place for the health concious!",

However, I have been four times hoping for a different outcome, but leaving with food poisoning every single time.   I always enjoy the food when I am there but hours later, not so much. I love burgers and I love fries and the menu looks so great and I want pinky's to be good so badly. I hear people talk and I dream about having a delicious burger but every single time, without fail, I have gotten sick. What from? I am not sure. The last time our entire table got sick so I can't be going crazy.   The restaurants appeal and staff are great so If you head that way, maybe just ask for a well cooked burger. Let me know how it goes.",

The atmosphere was inviting with music and good conversation with other customers and employees. The food was quick to the table and so good. We shared the waffle cut chilli & pimento cheese fries. The fries were crisp, the chilli was just the right consistency with a light spice & kiss of sweet which complements the creamy sharp cheddar bite of the pimento cheese. My wife had the patty melt; it was cooked perfectly with a good crisp crust from the flat top and gooey melting cheese. For her side she had the black beans and I must say these are a must have. Fresh, tender and sweet with a light spice, so good. My son had the popcorn chicken tossed in Buffalo sauce. The chicken was served in a very generous portion, big plump , juicy white meat with a light breading. He had enough for lunch after church the next day. I had the \"pinky dog\" which is an all beef dog served on a toasted bun with chilli and pimento cheese (refer to earlier in this post for details in chilli & cheese). With fountain drinks and tip we spent just under $50 so not bad. Was a great experience and excellent food, we definitely recommend it and will go back.",

My fiance ordered buffalo wings, but there was a heavy presence of garlic in the sauce. It didn't even taste similar to buffalo sauce. Not that we don't like garlic, but when we order buffalo wings we would like it to at the very least resemble it. Lastly the practice of \"team servers\" where every server shares every table is so inefficient. We felt like we were waiting around for long periods before we could get help. We didn't feel taken care of as customers.  This practice needs to get kicked to the curb.",

    "text": "Pinky's is a good spot to head when you're hungover on New Year's Day.  There was about a 20 minute wait since I guess everyone else had the same idea, but the tantalizing smells made it all worth it.  We were both hungry so we ordered a large basket of fried pickles.  Because it was so busy, we were seated next to another couple at a table that could hold a 4-top.  However, they ordered a small basket of fried pickles, and our orders were delivered to one another.  Luckily, the small basket wasn't small at all, so we were fine with it.  Any more would have been too many fried pickles, anyway.  They were perfectly fried, the batter was nice and crispy, and the pickles were juicy and salty.  I had requested a side of spicy ranch, which worked perfectly with them, but they otherwise came unadorned.  I think they should at least be served with some kind of dipping sauce.  For my meal, I got a Mammoth burger (two patties) with everything (mayo, LTO, pickles), cheddar cheese, and some fresh jalapenos.  The menu states that all burgers are cooked to medium well, a shade above the medium I normally like my burgers, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  They absolutely nailed it - this was the best burger I'd had in years.  The patties were perfectly seasoned, and they must use a lot of fat in their grind because even cooked to medium well, they were very very juicy.  The jalapenos lightened the burger and added some welcome kick.  I would eat one of these burgers every day if it wouldn't give me heart disease.  For my side I got onion rings, which the server warned were \"cut really thin\", which I was fine with.  The problem here is that they weren't onion rings...they were onion straws.  No rings to be found.  The onions were cut so thinly that it was mostly batter, and after sitting in the container for a few minutes while I enjoyed my burger, they kind of steamed to a soft consistency and weren't terribly enjoyable so I only ate about half of them.  I'd recommend either renaming them onion straws on the menu to avoid misleading the clientele, or adjusting the recipe so they're actually rings of onion.  Remember how our pickles order got messed up with the other couple at our table?  The same exact thing happened with our entrees as well.  Luckily we easily resolved it, but it was still a slight misstep.  Overall, this was a very encouraging first trip and I will definitely be back.  Aside from a couple bumps in the road for the service, and the underwhelming onion straws, the burger was so amazingly good that it was enough to earn them four stars.  Iron out the other issues and I'd gladly award all five.",

Now I'll be honest the burgers lack a lot of flavor and I don't understand how this is a \"top ranked\" burger. The burgers have no taste to them. I should have known better but I wanted to see what the hype is about. I now know for a fact Guy will co-sign anything. Still four stars because I do love this place but the burgers fall short.",

I could have eaten just those as my meal and been fine with it!! I had the 'The Patsy Melt' and sweet potato fries as my meal, both were great! My husband had the Pterodactyl Burger and added pimento cheese and bacon. I tried it and honestly liked it a good bit better than my Patsy Melt. Also would 100% suggest the Corn Dog Shrimp Basket!! It is very unique and very VERY good. Atmosphere is awesome as well. Would definitely suggest this restaurant!",

    "text": "You do have to dig deep and find local institutions to dine at while visiting another city. Stay away from those chains!  Pinky's was recommended to us by a nice guy who was working at the Manifest Records. So, yes, listen to the locals. Then, while looking through the local paper, Pinky's made the top 5 for best dinners in Charlotte! And yes, it made more than an appearance in Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\".   So, we kept the best for the last and stopped at Pinky's on the way to the airport, hoping for the best. The outside decor, a cute VW bug on top of the building didn't disappoint. Same with the cool, funky decor. If you're into music, movies, comics, this place is a little paradise decor wise. You'll keep looking around while listening to their fun tunes they're playing. Not a boring minute in there.  As you can imagine, this joint doesn't specialize in health food, although they have decent salads, wraps, a few Middle-Eastern dishes. Otherwise it's American diner food, with a Southern influence, pushed to it its limits.  We started with a basked of fried pickles, my first ever, and they were good. Greasy with goodness.  My husband tried their Korean Pork BBQ tacos and they were very tasty, with a nice slaw, the Tahini Salad was decent, fresh,  so was the White Trash burger (reading the menu in this place was a hoot).We got waffle fries for the table.   I saw their burger of the month while checking their menu on line (in November they had a Greek burger), the photo made me drool and that's all I kept thinking about. We went there in December, during the X-mas holidays, so the burger of the month was different, but the Greek one turned into a personal obsession for me (I love burgers and Greek food, so this was a perfect heavenly combination in my book). I usually don't go divaesque on anyone, but since the servers were super nice, I asked about the Greek burger and they offered to ask the chef to make one for me, with pita bread instead of buns and they did, and they made this girl super happy. The Greek burger didn't disappoint, it came with fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, Kalamata olives. Opa! Thanks for indulging me! It melted in my mouth, full of goodness.  What else can you drink with this type of food? We got a pitcher of local beer (the pitcher was our server's idea, it made it for a better deal, $15), tried the Lenny Boy de la Witt, a bit amber, I wish it was a bit stronger, but decent overall.  And no, we didn't stop here. We went big, so we ordered the desserts, the biggest banana pudding we've ever seen and the Cheerwine pound cake, nice, moist and fun.  Decent prices, good service, free parking to the right, once you pass the restaurant, cool, funky decor.  Once again, you don't go to Pinky's for health food, you indulge, dive in, experience a cool, fun, local institution.",

    "text": "Fresh of the plane at CLT, I just HAD to eat before I made the drive back to WNC.  Yelp suggested a cool little spot called Pinky's.  I immediately dug the atmosphere and the funky vibe.  Grabbed a seat at the bar in a small(er) booth built for two (sort of).  Booth could have used a bit more elbow room but I didn't get knocked into, so I guess it was alright.  I wanted to grab a quick bite and head out, so instead of scouring the large menu, I opted for the Mammoth burger (two 5oz patties) with cheese and bacon (can never pass up bacon!) on a gluten-free bun (rejoice!).  At first, I was second-guessing the 5oz patty size, but when you want more than 8oz and less than 16oz (standard \"big burger\" size nowadays), 10oz is a pretty good compromise.  I chucked on a size of sweet potato fries for good measure.  Food came very quick, and I was off to the races.  Fries were tasty, with just the right amount of crisp vs bend. I enjoyed them with a touch of salt.  The burger looked stout thanks to the smaller and taller patties, but the crowning (no pun intended) glory was that bun.  I haven't ran into a non-plain, non-sucky gluten free bun yet - but this was interesting.  Poppy and sesame seed buns encased this burger, and I was very intrigued.  The burger was cooked well with a good amount of season, but could have used a bit more pizzaz.  I guess with all the options, the plain burgers are plain.  The bun broke apart like a GF bun should so I definitely don't fault them for that - but it was tasty.  I really thought Pinky's shined i the service department.  It felt as if I had the whole staff waiting on me, and was helped by no less than 5 or 6 of the waitstaff.  Great teamwork, and I never had to wait for anything (even though I didn't need much).   Price was very reasonable for the food offered.  Would definitely return to again when in the CLT area.  Only downside, seems as if the parking lot was a bit small, and there seemed to be some remodeling going on - not sure if that cut the spaces down or not, but hey, new improvements are awesome!",

It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste at all! And all the wait staff have gross piercings and weird hair. The host had a huge nose ring that made him look like a cow or some other farm animal. The waffle fries were okay, and they only have waffle shaped fries, no other options. The seating inside is really cramped. You're basically shoulder to shoulder with the table next to you.  If you do go just don't get the patty melt. The banana pudding is pretty good though.",

I was torn between the White Trash burger and the Corn Dog shrimp, but ended up getting the burger with a side of fries. Honestly, I thought the burger was average, but it was tasty. Next time, I'll try the shrimp.   What I did thought was exceptional was the attentive service I received from the entire staff.   Also, they have great drink specials. On Saturday's, any cocktail that has Absolut vodka in it is only $5. I settled on the Wedding Punch and it was delicious.  I would recommend parking in the back, just keep driving past the entrance and you'll see the lot for parking.  I saw a yelper complaining about the walk, but it's nothing to worry about.   Overall, it's a fun place with a funky vibe. I'll be back, for sure!",

To top it off my uber driver raved about it so I went in feeling pretty confident.    To start, they had Firefly vodka, one of my favorites!  You don't find many places where I'm from serving it.  So I got one of the $5 cocktails with it, yum tasted like summer!    Also, pimento cheese isn't super prominent where I live so I took every chance I could to have it on just about anything while I was in town.  I zeroed in on the Pimp'n Fries and there was no turning back, melted pimento cheese over waffle fries, just the comfort food I needed!  Since it was just me and I was towards the end of my stay I knew getting one of their raved about burgers would be a waste since I was pretty content with my Firefly and Pimento Cheese fries for dinner.  BUT in the effort of being a little bit of a responsible adult I ordered the chicken tacos.  I was actually pleasantly surprised, the meat was very tender and the toppings were all really fresh, a nice compliment to the very decadent fries I was inhaling.   Atmosphere is fun and funky (True of most Triple D stops) and the service was great.  Everyone was super friendly and very accommodating.  A great way to round out my stay!",

Not much of a smile but good. Guy Fieri from the Food Network must have been here quite a bit and have autograph pictures and other items displayed in the place. I had The White Trash burger! Yeah the name of the burger made it sound like I got it from a trailer park BBQ right... Lol. It was juicy and fresh but not as flavorful as I would like it. The fries were, well FRIES! Nothing special about them. The food came out fast. Obviously the place is a local favorite because it filled up very fast. All in all I might try it again.",

The fries were average, but the honey mustard was amazing! It is apparently house made, so I highly recommend getting it with whatever you order.   She didn't come back to see what else I wanted, but someone else did. I ordered the chicken tacos and waited for about 30-45 minutes. The second server  checked on me several times, so she was very attentive and I appreciated that. When the food finally came, she said she would give me a 50% employee discount due to the wait and I was thrilled! I wasn't in a rush to be anywhere so I didn't mind the wait and didn't ask for a discount, but this was really wonderful customer service! (Especially because my most recent dining experience was the complete opposite.. see my review for hillside farmacy in Austin tx if you're curious).   Overall, this is a pretty solid 4/5 star review because the food wasn't extraordinary, but the customer service made up for it. I wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in town to try something else.",

The Shrimp Dogs (corn dog breaded shrimp) were uneventful, mostly breaded, and non seasoned below market shrimp.   Popcorn Chicken weren't crispy at all, basically just small grilled balls of small chicken pieces. It also costs an extra .75 to toss it in buffalo sauce that tasted like it came straight from a bottle of Frank's Red Hot (okayyyy make your money I guess).   Only plus side were the waffle fries. Not too crispy, not soggy, lightly salted.   Food presentation is paper plates, boats, and napkins which is fine being its kind of a divey place with cooky but fun decorations- and that fits the theme they're trying to achieve.   The service itself was nice, friendly, and prompt. Can't complain there.   I dunno for $30 with tip included, this place was over priced for the quality they serve. I probably won't be back and will let this one disappear into the back of my head, along with the other mediocre places to eat in Charlotte.",

I have never had to wait to eat here, but I've seen it busy even though it's a bit out of the way. Crane machine and photo booth are in the lobby area, which is always fun. I haven't had their desserts, but they always have fun cakes as options. Go, but don't go too much so I can keep getting sat quickly.",

    "text": "Having lived in Charlotte for a little over a year now, this was a place my husband and I had been wanting to visit. We are amateur burger connoisseurs, and we have heard great things about Pinky's, so, needless to say, we were pretty pumped for some Pinky's! We went on a Saturday night, so it was kind of busy. This does not bode well for customers because their parking lot holds approximately 8 cars (give or take a few). We lucked out and got a spot, but it was a hot mess when we were trying to leave! Next, the ambiance. The staff is very friendly, and the establishment itself is fun. It had that diner feel (I think it is a converted garage??), but while some diners can be antiquated and kind of dirty, this one was trendy and almost \"hipsterish\".   I am an avid hot-dog fan (trashy, I know), and the Pinky Dog looked MIGHTY yummy, but I was feeling a burger this evening. I ordered the White Trash Burger (burger patty with fried onion rings, fried pickles, and spicy ranch) because it is so highly regarded by fellow yelpers, and my husband got a mammoth burger \"Ding-Dong Style\" (includes crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro coleslaw, and Siracha hot sauce). We also split the Pimp Fries (waffle fries smothered with homemade pimento cheese and bacon). They looked like they had some really good cocktails, but we weren't there for drinks, so perhaps another time (and I will get that hot dog!).  The verdict: it was OKAY. My burger itself was not very good and a little over cooked (we were not given a cook-to-order option). The fried pickles and onion rings were good (how can you go wrong with fried food?), but there could have definitely been a little more spicy ranch on it; I couldn't really taste it at all. My husband's burger was about the same. The burger itself did not impress, but the toppings were unique and pretty good. He also felt that they skimped a bit on the Siracha. The fries, however, were the star of the meal. Their homemade pimento cheese is pretty delicious. I could probably have just eaten that with a spoon and been satisfied (remember what I said about being trashy?).  Thus, there are way better burgers in Charlotte, so I will not be going back for those, but there were some redeeming things that might have me paying them another visit in the future.",

When I went to the door, it was locked, and they had a chair wedged underneath it.  I pulled on the door and waited for them to open it.  When they did, I went in, they didn't greet me, smile, nothing.  They just turned their back to me and went about their business.  I walked past them and stood where a person normally would if they were waiting to be seated.  I turned to look back at the same staff that were annoyed that I was their first customer of the day, and said \"Can I just sit anywhere\"?  The beardy one mumbled \"yeah\", and I went to sit down at a 4 top table.  I was the only one in the restaurant.  Five seconds later, he ran over to say \"This place fills up fast, do you wanna sit at one of the smaller tables\"?  Ugh.  Not really, I don't want you to cram a party of four in beside me.  That's what I thought you meant by SIT ANYWHERE.  I got a Tyrannosaurus burger and fries.  Both were delicious, but the burger was smaller than I expected.  I got banana pudding for dessert to finish, and it was delicious and definitely homemade.  I had 4 or 5 different people visit my table to refill my drink, while I ate, so I never knew who my actual server was, and how to base my tip.  The beardy one that first greeted me helped the most, but he never smiled, nor said have a nice day.  Basic niceties, that's what this place is devoid of.  I will go back, because the food made up for the service, but if I am treated the same way, that'll be the last time.  I don't care if you're trying to be hipster, you come off like an a** in the process.",

On the other hand the burgers and the not quite fried turkey sandwiches are excellent if a little large.  The limeade/ginger drink is a tall cup of wellness that can heal what ails you. Not sure why I feel better when I have it but I do. The place is noisy but the food is worth it. I'd give more stars if there were more gluten free options especially dessert.",

I always order the fries smothered with pimento cheese and I'm always disappointed, though. The cheese is always overcooked, as if it was fried in the microwave too long. Note to self: stop ordering that!  In news other than pimento cheese, the corn dog shrimp are delicious. It's basically what you'd think: Corn dog batter wrapped around jumbo shrimp. I order it with blue cheese and buffalo dips. Speaking of dips, they are amazing, and so is the ranch. Very nicely done.   NOT good for large groups, as they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. As I tend to hang with people that simply cannot show up on time, it makes for a tough venue. But with 2-3 people, it's a great experience and I always love enjoying my cheat meal here!",

I would eat here once a week if my jeans didn't protest so loudly.  Great place for kids, or just grabbing dinner and beer with friends.",

The portion is generous and the seasoning tasted a little spicy but tasty.   We didn't have drinks but they had good beers listed. Parking is easier down the road in the dirt lot.

The restaurant inside and out has all kinds of signs and decorations on the wall making the restaurant quite interesting.  Rock music was played loudly inside which was not the most relaxing  conditions to eat lunch in my opinion. The menus features soup of the day , lots of fried food such as fried pickles ,fried Buffalo wings  , crab hush puppies. Some healtier foods like white bean and rosemary hummus, salads to choose from spinach salad , chicken salad  tuna salad ,turkey salad . Fried baskets: popcorn chicken baskets , corn dog shrimp baskets, different kinds of tacos , hot dogs, and of course their famous burgers plus all kinds of sandwiches and sides like southern slaw, fried squash onion rings ,  black beans, potato salad, hush puppies and sweet potato fries etc . My dining mate and  I tried the white trash burger which we heard was one of the most popular burger choices.( burger with provolone, fried pickles, fried onion rings). Burgers offered as doubles ( an extra burger on the bun ). All burgers are cooked medium well. Staff are friendly and accommodating, prices average, plated on paper, comes out hot, average portions. We liked our burgers, waffle and sweet potato fries and tasty honey mustard sauce. Tasty food, catchy names on menu. However we found nothing extraordinary with our burger and fries. However if you are into burgers dogs and fried food; all good with interesting combos. And oh yes, vegetarian burgers and hot dogs on the menu too. Desserts , banana pudding, cake etc. We would return and try something else.",

If you lived close, it would definitely be in the rotation, because it is a nice place.   Warning! If you are visiting and you have limited meals to try great food, this is not the place. Do not waste a meal here. The burger is nothing special, the taste of the actual patty is blend. The Chili Chese Fries are good, but nothing to write home about. Again, this place is not great, I would not recommend for an out of towner.",

My husband really wanted to try the crab hush puppies and I am glad he ordered them - they are super good! He ordered a white trash burger which he liked a lot, there is something about the meat that makes their burgers very tasty. Even the non-meat  (aka vegetarian) nature boy was seriously very good, though!  My order was right up my alley, a ding-dong style burger. This creation includes slaw, crunchy peanut butter and sriracha..and it really works. I did add some extra sriracha to cut thru the sweetness of the pb a bit, but I also really love spicy things.   I knew the pb/spice combo would work and be delicious because it's super similar to my staple breakfast; a toasted English muffin with pb, chili paste and cucumber.  Try it if you like this burger!",

There is something for everyone from a good old fashion burger to the more unique ding dong chicken (grilled chicken with PB, slaw, and sriracha -- trust me, it works); all types of salads, sandwiches, and apps in between.   I've tried almost everything on the menu but my standard meal here always starts with crab puppies -- hush puppies with crab meat. Good drink specials and a fun cocktail menu top it all off. Oh, and friendly service to boot!  Parking isn't so great. There is hardly any in the front but they have a full dirt lot in back. No big deal, other than it's a few extra steps but that never hurt anyone. I would also give a word of caution to parents taking their kids here: they play all kinds of music, some with non-kid-friendly language. I personally don't give a BLEEEEEP because that's part of what makes the place so charming for me. But I know others might be turned off by it.   Otherwise, definitely check the place out, I think almost anyone can enjoy it!",

My wife had the taco salad and it was huge with big chunks of chicken. She took some home and had enough for another whole meal. The prices were average. My biggest disappointment was the service.

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a place that appeared on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, to Pinky's Westside Grill in Charlotte.  Dora here. Don't be alarmed not to find a spot directly in front of the diner. Just at the end of the strip, you'll find ample parking, a plus for any business near downtown. The inside was jammed for a Sunday lunch.  For my lunch, I ordered the White Trash Burger, which includes provolone, fried pickles, and onion rings with a spicy ranch sauce and a side of onion rings (straws). For some reason, the burger that arrived had raw pickles and onions with mayonnaise. The burger was OK, a little over cooked for my taste, but served on a soft bun. Maybe if it would have been served as advertised on the menu, I would have been more impressed. The onion rings were good, but a little greasy.  Dora here. Check out the popcorn chicken, little nuggets of breaded and fried white meat, served atop waffle fries with a side of slaw. I'm a huge fan of chicken, fried or grilled, so when I saw this on the menu, I couldn't convince myself to go with something more adventuresome. Like Pimp'n Fries (waffle fries topped with chili and melted pimento) or the Asian-inspired Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich, marinated chicken slathered with peanut butter, hot sauce and slaw. I probably should've worked up the courage because the chicken could've used less time in the fryer; the outside was a bit dry and brittle. Awesome waffle fries, though, light on the seasoning and not too-potatoey as some tend to be.  Still Dora. Pinky's tag-team friendly servers ensure that your cup never runs dry. And if the crowd hanging around outside on a Sunday afternoon and the awesome reviews are any indication, we might've caught them on an off day.   We rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

My only complaint about the restaurant itself is that the music is really loud, and given the theme and the \"feel\" of the place, it's understandable. But we were sitting at a table for 2, not very far apart from each other, and we were practically yelling. The other small issue I had was....who was our server? We had 4 different people come to our table refilling our drinks, taking our orders, and giving us the bill. I appreciate not having to wait, but when it came time for them to take my card, no one was around. So I ended up leaving cash and we left. But the food was delicious. I ordered the buffalo shrimp tacos w/ arugula & Gorgonzola and a salad instead of black beans. The salad was a huge portion (not a problem) and reasonably priced, as were the (2) tacos I got. There was also the option of getting (3) tacos for a small up-charge. My friend got the (2) fish tacos and they were huge! So overall, we were very impressed with everything and would definitely go back again.",

The atmosphere is very welcoming and a little more intimate than a general sports bar, though it retains many of those qualities. We first split a large basket of fried pickles, which were excellent, but unless you're really into that sort of thing, the portion might be a little too large. We ended up boxing the leftovers. My roommate got a White Trash burger, which looked pretty great, and I got a double-pattied West Side burger, which had chili and mustard. We also each got waffle fries on the side, which were great. The burger's patties were slightly on the dry side, but the chili more than made up for that. Not having salt and pepper at the outdoor table was a bit of a challenge, but that too was easily fixed. All told, it was a great meal for a solid price, especially given the portions. We'll be back soon.",

    "text": "Decisions, decisions! You will want to comeback to this grill several times just to try all the tempting items on the menu. My favorite is the White Trash burger which is a 5 oz. burger served with provolone cheese, onion rings, pickles and spicy ranch sauce on it. I'm not a pickle guy so I leave those off and it is still delicious. The Big John is also tasty. Popcorn chicken salad is wonderful. I also recommend the Mammoth burger. I like mine with cheddar cheese and hot sirracha sauce with a side of honey cilantro slaw. The best appetizer is the crab puppies (sweet crab meat folded into golden hush puppies). Each time I walk into Pinky's I tell myself to try a different app but I always get the crab pups. Next time I visit I plan to try the Buffalo shrimp tacos. The young woman seated next to me got these and they looked good! She said if you like blue cheese this is for you. The staff is very attentive and friendly and the ambiance is unique and fun in a pulp fiction sort of way. Pinky's also has a full compliment of beers on tap and liquor. The only thing I'm not fond of is the way the serve your food in these cheap looking paper boxes. It's not very appealing to the eyes. Parking is limited but there are designated spaces available across the street at Duncan D.  This is a great place to take a date, friends, family or dine alone at the bar.",

    "text": "We finally had a chance this past Sunday evening to give Pinky's a try.  Luckily, we got there before the crowd, got one of the eight parking spaces in front, and were seated immediately.    The decor inside is playful and fun.  It's a very casual place, but not in a bad way.  We were a little confused by the service because we had no less than five servers visit our table, but I guess everyone just pitches in with every table and shares the tips at the end of the night?  You've gotta really like your co-workers for that, otherwise there's bound to be some hostility if someone's not pulling their weight.  Pinky's has a large drink menu (with great regular prices), as well as more non-alcoholic choices that restaurants typically offer.    The prices are also excellent on their food menu.  Items are a la carte, but they're so affordable that you don't feel ripped off ordering them that way.  We split the Pimp'n Fries (pimento cheese melted over waffle fries) appetizer (big enough for two) for $5.95 and then each ordered a sandwich for an additional $5.  The appetizer was AMAZING.  I probably could have used more cheese, though, for the naked fries at the bottom of the pile.    I ordered the Green Chile Pork sandwich.  Having been to Santa Fe recently, I was imagining those types of spicy flavors, since Green Chile is a big thing there.  The sandwich ended up being more Hawaiian to me, though, with the pineapple on top and other sweet flavors.  No spiciness here.  It still tasted delicious, though, and was just the right size.    Everyone was super-friendly and we enjoyed the meal.  The only problem was that because everyone just pitches in, it's kind of like \"the left hand not knowing what the right is doing.\"  It took awhile for us to get our fries appetizer and then when one of the servers picked up the empty basket, she asked, \"Are you waiting on anything else?\"  Uh yeah...our actual meal.  We waited quite awhile longer (and three drink refills) before our sandwiches were finally prepared and brought to us.  Then awhile after that for our check.  Luckily, we were still able to make our movie showtime, having budgeted some additional time.    All in all, we had a great time, and would return.  It's a great casual place to hang with friends, bring the family, or even out-of-town visitors.",

I came here the other day with some friends and was shocked I waited so long to try this place that is not even a mile away! We walked in and were sat immediately with nice staff and met by our server instantly. We ordered the fried pickles and shrimp puppies. The shrimp puppies dipped in tartar sauce was so tasty and good I could eat five orders and be fine with that. The fried pickles were good as well. For our entrees we ordered the fish tacos, white trash burger and the popcorn chicken salad. I had no idea the small five ounce burger with a fried green tomato would be so filling and tasty. The popcorn chicken salad must have weighed five pounds! It was delicious. The fried tilapia fish tacos were also a winner. We had onion rings and fries which you cant go wrong with anywhere. The service here was great. I think the servers must split tips because everyone comes and checks on you to make sure you are happy at all times. I love the rock style atmosphere they have as well. You don't go to places and here some good old metal or rock anymore. For the price and quality service and food you cannot beat this place.",

The Greek Pita sandwich tasted primarily of feta & I was able to see that there were tomatoes & olives I couldn't taste them.  Waffle fries were limp - not crisp.

The fried pickles were light and out of this world and the wasabi ranch that comes with it was great.   I ordered the green chili pork and my wife ordered the stray dog (veggie dog). Neither of us were impressed with our choices. At first bite the pork  and pineapple seemed to go well, but I was struggling to finish it. And my wife said she'd had better veggie dogs before, but she really liked the veggie chili on the dog. They seem to have a decent beer menu and some good craft brews (I had the Red Oak Amber Ale). Their cocktail list was exhaustive and I really enjoyed the $5 Bloody Mary.",

We were complete fatties that day. I got the White Trash burger and a side of potato salad while my friend got the green chile pork with a side of fried zucchini.  My burger was absolutely delicious and was not too huge that I could not fit it in my mouth. Also, I am generally pretty picky about my potato salad, but this was red potato salad with a slight kick to it. It had celery in it as well as another green herb of some sort. It tasted great, i took some home for later! My friend also very much enjoyed her sandwich - and who doesnt like fried zucchini - dipped in ranch they were even better?! I had asked our waiter, which btw the waitstaff was also great but more about that later, which was the most popular item. He then said that fried pickles were first, and the white trash burger was second. Well, lucky for me - fried pickles come on the white trash burger. Knocked out two birds with one stone! Saturday was also $4 any Absolute drink. I got a Madras which turned out to be really strong for only $4.  What i really liked about this place, was that all of the waiters helped eachother out. We didnt just have one waiter, we had 3. We werent harassed every two minutes but we also were not forgotten about. The service was excellent. The restaurant is kind of on the brim of a not so good area - but i would definitely go here again!",

The decor is busy and keeps your eyes wandering. The drink menu suggests it's a cool place to have a cocktail.  Shared server service not really blown away by this idea.  Felt uncertain whom to communicate, odd down here in the south.  Food all seemed interesting.  I'm swayed ( by the group) to try fried pickles again.  Bad idea.  Salt salt and more salt. Crisp but salty.  Generous portion but salty.  Wasabi dipping sauce helped a lot.  I had the Paddy Melt, well seasoned but not memorable.  I tried the hush puppy shrimp, interesting but I thought a little too much soft texture.  Oh wait, send in that wasabi sauce again.  Better.  I think you can bounce around the menu and find something that flips your hair back but even so, it's a great hangout spot.  Great place to sit, in or out and pass the time.  I'll go back for sure.",

They have come away a clear winner and a fixture on my rotating cravings list.",

It took 15 minutes to get the menu, the bartenders could not have been ruder!!!  When i asked for a beer they didnt have she threw the beer list at me and didnt come back for another 15 minutes.

I had some delicious fried fish tacos that lulled me close to food narcolepsy.  Atmosphere is casual and personable, with good service - I felt like I was in a neighborhood hangout (though this little section of town is more of a crossroads than a neighborhood).  The bar area is great, with some nice selections on tap.  Pricing is affordable as well - on both the food and drinks.  I was amused that the food was served with plastic utensils and disposable trays and would have liked to see something more solid - but I guess it adds to the atmosphere and savings on a dishwasher?  Brilliant place for casual dining and relaxing.",

However, I will write this review not as a comparison but as an honest review. First, the service is very quick and the food delivers. The fried pickles are very delicious as are the burgers. The fried Chicken sandwich is also very good. I really like the fact that they have waffle fries but they do come with a little Cajun seasoning that I feel isn't enough. I wouldn't have even noticed it was there until I actually saw it. Their jukebox needs some work as it contains mostly mid to late 90's music. It's a great place to stop in for a good greasy meal but the decor is a bit flashy for me and lacks that certain down home dive restaurant feel that makes you want to linger ( I'm sure the music also plays a part).  I say that if you find that you are lacking a good burger and fried pickles then this is the place to go.",

Relying on super greasy, fried foods and a full bar, Pinkies is located in West Charlotte, which is frankly kind of a bad place to be considering that all there is in this area of West Charlotte is hamburger joints.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is the fried pickles. Those fried pickles just have a way of making things better. I had the chicken tenders and my mom had a hamburger (I guess I should've been a little more creative, but I thought it would be difficult to mess up chicken tenders...guess not). Her hamburger came with nothing but well...a greasy hamburger in a basket. My chicken tenders were a bit burned, but the fries were great. We had 3 different waitresses checking up on us, but getting the check took a long time. A group came in (we went on a Monday afternoon...a teacher workday) and wanted to be seated, and getting enough tables together took about 10 minutes and space was very crammed. I'd like to think that this was because it was at prime lunchtime, but how in the world do they handle Saturday night crowds, especially when the parking lot has about 6 spots? Guess I'll have to go back someday and see.  Overall, this is no Penguin, so don't go in looking for that. The food was eh, the service was eh, the location is eh, it just wasn't what I hoped it would be. I guess if I were old enough to drink I would've enjoyed it more...",

Pinky's is on the corner of Morehead and Freedom Drive.  Across from The Burger Company and a Tattoo Parlor.  The exterior is actually pretty cool looking.  There is an old VW bug on the roof, a triceratops statue outside, and the building looks like an old garage converted to a restaurant.  Inside has some interesting decor, seems they're trying to be a little unique and they are.  Parking... wow.  There are about 6 parking spots, don't even bother pulling in.  Just park across the street and walk.  Seriously, traffic can be bad and the one way in one way out can be a pain when there are 6 cars in the lot.  I hate to give a bad review and I will come back, but my experience wasn't the greatest.  Walking in you'll have a small waiting area with a hostess stand with a hostess present most of the time.  To your right you'll have the dining area and bar.  The night I went there were two servers, and a bartender.  To place an order you go to the bar which is typical, but be careful waiting in the waiting area.  You'll have to check on your order.  There were two men in Pinky's uniform in addition to the women working the floor and bar.  I asked one for some help or if he could check on my order and was told \"I'm not working I'm just making sure things go ok here.\"  Yea well 20 minutes after being told 10 minutes and I still dont have my order, things aren't ok.  Turns out it was just sitting behind the bar.  I guess I should have asked more often.  I ordered the Ding Dong Chick and crab puppies.  I'm not sure where they get Thai style  with the chicken, tasted exactly like it sounds.  Is that even possible? For sound to taste?  Anyways you know what I mean.  Ding Dong Chicken:  Grilled chicken breast, crunchy peanut butter, cole slaw.  Just didn't do my palette justice.  But hey they say not to try it first so its hard to knock it.  I just expected a little more spice or flavor in the chicken.  The Crab puppies... think hush puppies with crab meat in them.  Thats what the description says, what they lack is actual crab meat.  They were big deep fried hush puppy balls, I tore every one up and had others try them.  No taste of crab what so ever nor site of any meat.  Pourina tried them too and his elite taste buds could not sense any crab either.  Needless to say, sounds like growing pains.  I will try again but my lord if your going to offer crab puppies put some damn crab meat in them!!!",

The awesome color-changing specials board behind the bar is fun to look at, and my friend and I were seated immediately at the bar in the middle of the afternoon, past people who were also there in 2's but who apparently had something against immediate gratification.  Oh well, all the better for us!    Since I love anything with crab in it, we ordered the crab hush puppies.  They came piping hot, with tasty, tangy remoulade sauce accompanying.  After my friend and I had each tried one, our food came immediately...pretty much turning them into another side.  The waitress did apologize, saying that sometimes they came out early and sometimes it all came out at the same time.  Well, ok.  That's not really how the appetizer/entree system works, but they're in early days and CRAB HUSH PUPPIES HOW COULD I EVER BE MAD???  They were delicious, decadent and rich.    I also had the embarrassingly named 'Da Pimp' sandwich, which was my first ever time eating pimento cheese (I'm a terrible southerner, sorry guys!) and it was alright.  I guess I'm just not crazy about pimento cheese.  But, but, but, BUT!  As my side I ordered the beer battered fried squash, and, you guys.  They were.  So good.  Not totally smothered in batter, just a light, yet crispy coating, which allowed the squash flavor to shine along with the delicious crispiness.    It was only my first visit but I'll definitely be back.  I have to see how the burgers are and of course the fried pickles.  As far as the whole this vs. the Penguin thing, I intentionally didn't order anything that was the same from both menus, and what I had was delish.  So I suggest going there with no preconceived notions in your head and just enjoy good food and good beer.  (p.s. park across the street by the head shop...it is decidedly very penguin-esque in it's parking situation...)",

They have a large selection of \"more healthy\" eats for those who don't want a burger and waffle fries. Lots of great salads. The food here is very close to the Penguins, but dare I say it, I like the menu a lot better. Way more options, and I can't think of anything thats missing.

    "text": "Sooooo normally this place is phenomal. However had to go glutten free and per the website they say it's accomidating we came. Got the gluten free mammoth burger in a lettuce wrap. Wrap being the noticeable word. When it came out it was a burger on a piece (burger sized ) of lettuce. Not wrapped not where I could eat it with my hands. I did manage to get a fork and a knife however because I was stuck eating a burger without the bun it started eating through the little paper thing in the boat. Had to flag down another waiter (ours actually hasn't returned for a while) who when asked if everything was okay said she'd go get the manager.  Eventually the manager did come out although I didn't ever get her name and took care of the \"lettuce wrap\" prepare yourself if you order that.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on our way to see \"The Toxic Avenger\" at the new location of Actor's Theatre of Charlotte and we needed a quick bite and cocktail before the show. I did a search on Yelp and came across Pinky's Westside Grill. What a great find! We found a parking spot in the small front lot and although there were people waiting for a table, the hostess told us the bar was first come, first serve. We grabbed two stools and checked out the menu. I ordered a pterodactyl burger \"ding dong style\" (peanut butter, slaw and sriracha sauce, which I had on the side). My husband ordered the pterodactyl burger \"westside style\" which had chili and coleslaw. Both were delicious and the side of sweet potato fries with honey mustard sauce were tasty as well. The burgers are all cooked to medium-well, which is not how we usually order but they were not dry and had a lot of flavor. The drink special for Thursday was any flavored Absolute vodka drink for $5. My favorite was the unicorn tears and my husband's was the Swedish Mule. Our bartenders were friendly and helpful, and the guy who brought out our order was professional and pleasant. We loved the funky atmosphere and the low prices on the menu were great. So great that we ordered two slices of lemon cake to go. Pinky's is a fun, tasty \"dive\" that we will be bringing our teenage daughters to!",

Arrived around 12:30 and did not have to wait, which was suprising,because the place is usually packed.  I dig the decor,and the inked up wait staff who are always friendly, attentive and quick with the refills.The fried pickles were spot on on today.  I had the white trash burger, which was as always delish!  The service is fast, the food hot, plentiful and consistent.  The drink menu is very imaginative, although I always go for lunch, so I haven't had the pleasure of trying anything on it.  I'll have go for dinner to give something a try.  Parking is usually a bit of a challenge, as the parking lot is very tiny (there's additional parking directly across the street and to the right of the building, but this inconvenience is worth it for the treat that you will get inside.",

We started with the Pimpin Fries, waffle fries much like Chick Fila's with homemade pimento cheese melted on top. My hubby doesn't even like pimento cheese and was raving about them. He got a Mammoth burger (double) and couldn't finish it all, it was huge! I had the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich at the suggestion of our server who said nothing on the menu was as good as it. Chicken breast, some yummy sweet cole slaw, siracha, and crunchy peanut butter made for a delicious sandwich. Whoever thought of putting peanut butter on a chicken sandwich is genius! My daughter had the basic chicken sandwich ad said it was good. We all topped the stay off with a single bowl of banana pudding, which was excellent and fed all three of us. I will definitely make this a regular in Charlotte!",

    "text": "This place is a blast!  It's the kind of joint that makes you wonder why there aren't more like it.  They're not reinventing the wheel.  The menu is low priced and fun.  Very fun.  Check out the names and ingredients.  These are people who don't take themselves too seriously and it shows.  The bar is cool with quality people behind it.  I love that they have microbrew roulette which for $3 they blindly pick a random bottle of craft beer and that's what you get.  So simple but so much fun!  Parking sucks but most urban joints I've been to coast to coast have that problem.  The burgers are very, very good and I got what has to be the best $3.50 item I've ever bought in a dive.  It's a chili dog with pimento cheese spread under the chili.....Why didn't I think of that?!  If I get a little scratch and can open a place in my adopted hometown of Sanford, FL I will blatantly steal some of the great ideas this place exhibits.  If one can voice any complaint it's that nothing on this menu begins to approach healthy and after a bout with many beers, liquor and a mother load of calories one can feel like a tick.  So very stuffed and bloated that not even a nap can help.  Well my visits were on a three day vacation weekend so moderation wasn't on the menu.  Great little joint!",

It doesn't involve unicorns making love to heart shaped clouds, or cupid shooting arrows at Cleopatra, but  something similarly fantastic. It wasn't  When Harry met Sally but  rather when Corndog met Shrimpy. Something incredible happened that day, It was kismet I tell you.   A plump sweet corn-dog coating on top of succulent shrimp with an array of dipping sauces for your consumptive pleasure. All of this nestled in bed with crisp waffle fries galore ...they were just begging for it (malt vinegar that is). Wash it all down with a refreshing Crispin cider on tap...and you have one banging meal. That's right, I said it...this meal is not for Pinky's virgins!   But alas I was until this day, and rest assured I'll be back...because you never forget your first!  Yours Truly,  One Satisfied Yelper!",

My mom and I proceeded to order and we have both had better. Their burgers and overly battered and fried toppings were unimpressive. I would rather have Wendy's. It may be a good place for 2 am munchies, but I recommend saving your money and grabbing a burger elsewhere.",

    "text": "Pinky's is one of those places that I have been to so many times and just never got around to reviewing. I think that part of the reason for that is that there is no way to do it justice. This is probably my favorite burger spot in Charlotte. It used to be the Penguin, but that is no longer the case (a different story entirely).   Pinky's serves up a great burger at a great price. It also has a funky/eclectic atmosphere that keeps things interesting. I've tried just about every combination of the burger here and they all have their merits. My normal go to is the \"White Trash Burger\" which comes with fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch. Another good option is getting a burger \"ding dong\" style. This style consists of crunchy peanut butter, honey cilantro slaw and sriracha. I know this sounds odd, but this combination of flavors just works. I could go on and on about the burger, but I don't want to write a book here.   The appetizers/sides are just as good as the burgers. I would highly recommend the fried pickles, which are lightly breaded dill pickles that come with ranch. They come out hot and their is a big pile of them for just a couple of dollars. I would also recommend the Pimpin' Fries which are waffle fries smothered in pimento cheese. You can also add chili which just makes them all the more delicious. I know all of these things sound greasy and they are, but they are delicious. If you are looking for a healthier option, I've heard from many that their veggie dogs are some of the best.   The service at Pinky's is always friendly and efficient. I've never had too much of a problem with slow service, but they do tend to get very crowded. That being said, there is a good amount of seating, especially during the summer when the outside space can be utilized.   Pinky's is a great price and they run some good specials throughout the week. One that comes to mind is their craft beer special on Tuesdays that offer all drafts for $2.50. They have a pretty good beer selection, and they always have some local Charlotte brews on tap.   Parking is nearly impossible in their main lot, but there is overflow parking available across the street at the Dunkin' Donuts.   Pinky's is a funky local place that is great for residents and a great place to bring visitors to the area. The food is delicious, interesting, and cheap. It is a great place to grab lunch or a beer after work. I highly recommend.",

Most featured eateries I have been to are lack luster. Pinky's is fun, colorful, and so so yummy. If you're calorie conscious, give that up for one night, it will be worth it. Pinky's not only has a variety of delicious burgers, but they have amazing drinks. Their drinks have fun clever names, like Unicorn Tears. I have had their veggie burger and their meat options, and I wish I had a second stomach so I could eat more. They also have scrumptious sides and an addicting was ranch to dip things in. I always say I am going to order their banana pudding for dessert, but I stuff myself on the other yummies beforehand and fill myself up. One day, it will happen. I don't just recommend Pinky's, I say it is a MUST try.",

I got the white trash burger and it was like heaven in my mouth! I am a big burger person and this definitely hit the spot. We also got the hush puppies and cheese fries with pimento cheese for sides/appetizers which also did not disappoint. I love that the menu has so many options, so really whatever you are in the mood for you can get at Pinky's, including vegetarian options! The cocktails are fantastic as well, I got a mojito and it was refreshing and strong!

If you like ginger, this margar is for you! Cool and refreshing like a margar should be with the perfect hint of ginger. I need one now... but it's snowing.  ANYWAY, they do have really good burgers with unique toppings (ahem, ding dong style). I've ordered the chicken tacos before, which were great. I also love their Camp Green House Salad. They serve high quality greens and offer a variety of house-made, unique dressings.   During my most recent visit, the service was excellent. We had full glasses and everything we needed.   I'm really looking forward to their new porch and I will definitely be back soon!",

I would say that anything on this menu could easily be cooked by anyone with any small amount of skill in the kitchen and taste at least the same if not only slightly worse. corn dog, was.. a corn dog. hot dog had a very low quality, bleh, chili. Hushpuppies were very grainy   and bland, probably would have held up better with a bbq sauce dip or something like that. fried pickles were good.  wouldnt come back here or advise anyone to visit unless theyre a fan of subpar american food.",

My beer arrived in a snifter glass and when I said something to the waiter he said that's just the way it's served. I showed him it's listed under the menu section for pints and then he had the nerve to say if you pour it in a pint glass then they're roughly equal amounts. Face palm. Not even close, but I let it go. Next, the crab meat hush puppies have so little meat in them that the taste is indistinguishable from the same regular hush puppies given out for free at bbq joints. Waste. Lastly, the asian pork burger had almost no flavor to it. This was a very disappointing experience all around.",

There's a Giant Triceratops dinosaur out front and a VW bug on top of the building. It was an awesome day so we got to sit outside and enjoy the shaded patio spot.   The wait staff was helpful but all had a stand off-ish rock n roll vibe. Good at they job but not bubbly. I think it kinda fit the atmosphere and they all work together to help your table.   The food was GREAT. There tons of different options - tacos, burgers, hot dogs, salads and we all had a hard time choosing. I love the large number of vegetarian options- even veggie dogs!   My parents loved the hot dog and I loved the buffalo shrimp tacos. The tacos had arugula and Gorgonzola and were so fresh, not too spicy. The sweet potato fries and waffle fries were nice n crispy with great dipping sauces - get BOTH Wasabi Ranch and Honey Mustard!! The famous shrimp corn dogs were tasty - battered whole shrimps with dipping sauce and slaw. Also the black beans side dish BLEW US AWAY. I was not excited about them but the flavor was so dang good we fought over them.   The drink menu is fun and huge- the cocktails all looked strong and tasty. We kept saying we'll be back soon!",

They were full of crab and they came with some fantastic tartar sauce.  Another appetizer we got, which was the best thing we got was the Pimp'n Fries.  One of the best things I have ever have.  Waffle fries drenched in a pimento cheese mix.  Just fantastic.  Worth the calories and guilt when they are gone.  Get them!!!  We had burgers, chili dogs and a salad.  They were above average.  Not the best ever but good.  This place is legit because of all the comfort food options and the price is so cheap.  What a reasonable price for great food and beer.  The happy hour specials which are always going are fantastic.  This place will become a regular for me. Go and indulge !",

    "text": "Our party of six came in here on a cold, rainy Sunday evening.  The place was busy and we were told about a 15-20 minute wait, which turned into 50 minutes.  Meanwhile, smaller parties of 4 were being seated immediately.  The host kept apologizing but that didn't get us seated any sooner.  I saw two tables empty and they could have been pushed together for six people but it didn't happen.  They were given to people who came in after us.  Eventually, we were seated and the waitress did immediately come to take our drink order.  During our wait to be given a table, we had already memorized the menu and decided what we wanted, so she took our food order also.    I ordered the popcorn chicken and husband wanted the corn dog shrimp. I ordered the mixed drink called Unicorn's tears.  Everyone's drinks came but mine.  I had to ask about it and there was another wait because the waitress forgot to put the drink order in.  She apologized and eventually, our food and my drink arrived.  The food was good and husband was pleased with his shrimp.  I didn't like the Southern slaw, but my chicken and waffle fries were fine.  Others in our group were happy with their food also.    I think I would have enjoyed the evening more if it had gone smoother with the seating issue.  I was ready to go somewhere else after the 20 minute mark had passed and seeing others be given a table ahead of us.  I liked the atmosphere, loud music, eclectic people...but it will be awhile before I return.",

It's one of those spots that I hope never goes out of style but is beginning to be more and more well known, which is probably a good thing.   I've had sandwiches and burgers that are delicious here, and their sweet potato fries are perfect, as well as the fried pickles.  Also recently tried a salad option which was great.  It was a hefty salad - order the buffalo shrimp but asked for grilled chicken instead of the shrimp and they give you a healthy portion of the chicken on top!   They have a perfect patio for those nice weather days, and a huge bar selection with many local beers on tap and plenty to choose from! It's definitely a must try for any charlottean.",

Well that didn't go as planned. They don't allow dogs on their patio. I definitely understand this rule and I don't have a problem with it but I do have a problem with them not stating it on their site or Facebook. The majority of restaurants in Charlotte allow dogs and I was really surprised they didn't and didn't even have a sign posted on the door saying so. I'm giving two stars for lack of communication.

We ordered the fried pickles and crab hush puppies. The fried pickles were good, but the crab hush puppies were awesome. I do not eat hush puppies often, as I live in the Northeast, so to have such things with the addition of crab was just fantastic.   Wanting to do the South right, I ordered the grilled bologna sandwich \"westside,\" with chili, slaw, mustard, onion, and then some pimento cheese. My cousins ordered the white trash burger (provolone, fried pickles, ranch) and a patty melt, respectively. Both of them had nothing but good things to say about their sandwiches.   I wasn't thrilled with the bologna sandwich, but I ate it anyway. The roll was a little too soft, which made things very sloppy - although that was probably to be part of the experience. The bologna didn't have much taste; I think I was expecting something more like Taylor ham. But it was prepared well, because my Southern cousins approved when I let them try it. As a result, I can't criticize the kitchen; it just wasn't to my personal taste. You win some, you lose some... unless we're talking about weight, which I'm sure I wouldn't lose if I lived near Pinky's.  The service was great and the prices were fair. I would like to come back and try some of their fun mixed drinks one night, as well as the Cheerwine and Sun Drop pound cake.",

While the crab puppies were tasty, nothing was memorable.  I probably won't return.",

Their crab puppies are pretty unique and love eating a few of those. The drink menu is diverse and offers quite a few fun drinks. It's a small restaurant, so wait times can be long, but all of the waiters/waitresses work as a team, so service is pretty quick once you're seated!",

The menu was easy to read and featured different food offerings (Burgers in 3 sizes, Hot Dogs -Corn Dog or Rueben styled, Chicken or Burger Sandwiches with crunchy peanut butter topping)!   The three of us had 2 \"The Jive Turkey Burgers, a White Trash Burger and a Reuben Hot Dog (minus 1000 Island dressing & swiss cheese) and Sweet Potato Fries. It was $5 ABSOLUTE Night, so we had a few alcohol drinks too. The food was good tasting and we were pleased, but the best was saved for last....the dessert. We chosed the Banana Pudding over the \"Cherry Lemon Sundrop, Almond Confettie or Chocolate Swirl Cupcakes\" and we were DELIGHTED!!! The pudding was great and had a very homemade cold pudding taste (made with whopped cream) served in a stryfoam bowl.  Oh, I forgot to mention that all the plates, utensils or cups were either paper, stryfoam or plastic. No diswasher needed at this place, well at least not for the food unless it for the pots and pans!! Lol  I would come back, if only for the \"Banana Pudding\"!!! Smh/lol",

I'm pretty sure that I was waited on by every server working tonight, and each one was efficient and friendly.  The service was awesome.  My fitbit exploded as I finished my meal, since I picked probably the least healthy (but most delicious) options.  I had what was supposed to be a bakers dozen crab fritters, but there were 15 total.  I ate every one.  The crab was sweet, and the fritters a perfect golden color.  The tartar sauce they came with for dunking was more than mayo and relish...it had a vinegary bite that was an awesome compliment to the sweet.  Then I had ginormous corn bread shrimp.  The batter was thick, but not greasy.  Again, the bite of some cocktail sauce perfectly offset the sweet of the corn batter.  I don't like fries, and usually skip them, but the waffle fries that came with the shrimp were crispy, and had the right amount of salt.  The only reason I didn't eat them all was because I was stuffed.  I'll be back.",

Hardly any parking, but if you determine to get inside somehow, you're gonna love it! We started with the waffle fries that comes with pimento cheese and added bacon to that for a scrumptious result! The fries were crispy, the pimento cheese was excellent, and the bacon was real! Next, I got the White Trash Burger that was simply amazing! A nicely cooked burger with cheese, fried pickles, fried onion strings, and a spicy ranch mayo! Seems as though they have a very creative drink menu with specials every day! What kept me from giving them a five star rating was simply, the service! The servers all seemed disinterested. We struggled to get refills, waited nearly 10 minutes for a glass of wine, and the ticket was just kinda tossed on the table! This southern gentleman will certainly be back, at least for the food.",

We ended up stopping at an off time so we could make sure we got a table. When we walked in, the atmosphere was so fun and casual. They have so many cool things on the walls that you could probably go 100 times and find a new thing every time.  It was so hard to choose because everything looked so amazing, most of the items on the menu were very interesting because its hard to imagine what a corndog shrimp looks like. We ended up ordering a bunch of things; we got the Pinky Dog, Pimp'N Fries, and the White Trash Burger. If you couldn't tell we got a little excited about Chili. The White Trash Burger was probably my favorite because I loved the fried pickles on top. The drink I had was the Wedding punch, it had Absolut Citron, Amaretto, Melon Liquor, House Made Sour & Pineapple Juice. It was a very light refreshing drink to go with all that heavy Chili. I recommend if you are ever in the area to try out Pinky's. It will definitely be a place I will go again!",

She always raves about the food here! So when I was planning my trip here, she insisted on me making Pinky's one of my stops.  The food was pretty good. I love any place that actually serves good fried pickles. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad as my meal, though I'm not quite sure why as I'm not a big fan of spicy food at all. But aside from that, the food was really good. I would have wished I ordered something else just because it was very spicy.  It's a small restaurant, and you're in very close proximity with your table neighbors. You can hear a lot of conversations outside of your own this way.",

The message was very passive-aggressive and I expected more from the top of the company. Really liked your establishment. Seriously. Ruined it for me,man. Integrity shot. Didn't deserve this treatment.  Terrible manager - Ran into manager on duty who was terrible at customer service. Came to hang a poster for a show and get a bite to eat. While this might have been the first time I did not have tape on me to hang the poster, usually I do have it. I asked a server on hand if they might have some tape. The server tells the manager who comes out and tells me \"Sorry you can't hang your poster. We don't sell supplies we sell burgers\". Thing is I always come here so I'm well aware of what they sell there. Let her know it's not ever cool to talk to a customer the way she did and she tells me she thought what she said was funny. No remorse and no apology. Gotta do better on the front,Pinky's.",

The hostess was really friendly, but the rest of the staff was OK.  I understand it was Friday around 8ish or 9ish and they were slammed.  Loved the set up of this little spot.  Got the crab puppies and they were Fantastic.  The white trash burger was okay, just need some season on the patty.  Overall it was good.  Not from Charlotte, but will come back for those crabpuppies.",

I appreciated the very quick and collective service that Pinkys provides, in which  all servers take care of all tables. The only issue I had with this is at one point I wasn't quite sure which person to track down to receive a fork for my food.   We ordered the crab puppies for an appetizer and man oh man oh man we're they good. I think I ate half of them instead of my meal. The tartar sauce that came with them was very rich and sour creamy which was a different but delicious offering. For dinner, I got the pinky dog which was very good but heavy and kind of hard to eat with it being topped so heavily with chili and cheese. My boyfriend had the Korean pork tacos which were really good and we shared a side of waffle fries that were cooked perfectly. Everything was really good but I still left a little disappointed. Maybe everyone has just talked it up way too much.   I did really really enjoy the atmosphere and decor in the restaurant and would recommend their very quick service! I would come back but try something new (except for the crab puppies, I will need those again)",

Get an extra side of spicy ranch on the side because you're gonna love it. Staff is super friendly and knows the menu well.

I couldn't believe she didn't offer to pay for my drinks or offer me one.   I actually asked jokingly and she was like oh ok I guess you can have a free drink.   I was like can you take one off that was on my tab.   She said ok.   She then took my friends drinks off that were on special for $3 not mine!!   I was the one sprayed!!!!!

Great suggestion especially since this is another spot that has been featured on one of my favorite food show Diners Drive Inn and Dives.  The place is a great dive bar with a really cool patio! There are all types of cool artifacts on the walls. Are bartender also was really great and made sure my friends and I got our orders in before the kitchen closed!  I got the 5 ounce PTERODACTYL burger with everything on it. All burgers are cooked medium well and my burger was juicy something I look for when eating a good burger. Unfortunately the burgers don't come with fries so I had to order them as a side. They give you a good amount of waffle fries which was a good thing because u shared them with my friend.  I had my burger prepared with everything on it just one of the various ways you can get. They also have other menu items including crab puppies (hush puppies with crab in them) and corn dog shrimp! Can't wait to go back and try both of them on my next visit. They have a great drink menu and even a section for those who don't drink alcohol. Make sure you check the pinks painted Volkswagen bug!",

We had burgers, a hot dog, drinks, the southern coleslaw, and the pimento cheese fries.   All were very good in their own right. I wouldn't say spectacular, but the atmosphere and very kind staff definitely made up for it.  I WILL say though, their pimento cheese fries I could eat all day, every day and not get tired of it. You don't just get a small glob of cheese that only touches a few fries. This thing COVERS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PRECIOUS WAFFLE FRY ANGELS - and that cheese leaves such a great twang at the back of your tongue that you just want more.   Also...we had the wedding cake cocktail and the white chocolate cocktail. YES LAWD. So good!  We'll be back for the drinks & fries for sure!!",

We initially ordered the crab puppies and Greg's fried pickles. Those came out and the pickles were just ok but the crab puppies were awesome!!! For our main meal I ordered the mammoth burger with everything. A short time later it arrived and it was truly mammoth! See attached picture.   Beer selection was good. I would have liked to see some more IPA's but what they had was ok.   Overall I gave Pinky's 5 stars for the overall atmosphere, food, and drinks. Parking is ok just have to walk around the front, which was needed after eating all that food.  We will definitely go back next time we are in town.",

The service is slow, and while people will try to explain that \"it's worth the wait!\"  I have not found that to be True.    Waiting 20 minutes to sit down at a table at 1pm seemed crazy when I saw open tables inside and out.  My last waitress seemed too busy for us, and just hurried to get our order.  Our burgers looked like they came from Five Guys - they were fine, just nothing to write home about, nor were they worth the wait.  It was a medium sized patty, plenty greasy, and a cheap bun.  The price is OK - total cost was only a few dollars lower than getting a cheeseburger from Firebirds though - and took just as long without the flavor and ability to order it Medium versus Pinky's standard Medium-well ONLY.    I won't go out of my way to go here.",

We did have to wait approximately 15 minutes before we got a table. The atmosphere is super relaxed but not so much that you are ignored and the service lacks. I was super thrown back by the taste of the ancho wings. Those things were amazing with some blue cheese dressing. My husband had the pinky dog sub vegetarian dog (doesn't eat pork). I had the big John which was super big and enough food to feed two people. I had a side of onion rings and my husband had fries. Everything was great. I have also ordered pick up before and they were quick and everything was hot. I will continue to come here and so should you.",

Recently, becoming a vegetarian in the past year (May 2017) it has been so annoying trying to eat out without eating the same stuff over and over and over again. There are not many restaurants that go out of there way to get creative and serve awesome and delicious food like Pinkys. They sure know how to make a carnivore and a vegetarian/ vegan happy while eating out together. My vegan chili dog was amazing its been three weeks and I still can taste it! It taste just like any other chili dog! I promise, I know this. The hush puppies are so good and they serve a ton! The beer selection was very good too! Very disappointed I was too stuffed to try dessert. But, when in Charlotte I will make sure to always stop at Pinkys.   Awesome decor and music selection by the way! Hey, would you consider opening a location in Atlanta, GA? ( Very big smile)",

Especially the crab puppies! If you're on the fence about what to try...get these! I also really enjoy all the sauces that came with the food. I can't remember them all but I know they were yummy!

But if you slice them like chips, and fry them, somehow I've found love.  These were perfectly done and crispy. And they came with a side of ranch.  The small is plenty for 2 people, trust me.  I got the pterodactyl burger with pimento cheese and my mom got the white trash burger.  Everything was fresh, quick and delicious. I'll definitely come back here.

The employees were very cool, and very helpful on the menu. I've had many things on there menu, but the best things I've had was the white trash burger! Nothing beats a juicey burger with provalone, fried pickles (YES FRIED PICKLES), crispy onion straws and spicey ranch! It was one of the tastiest burgers I've had.

I've been back here at least 4 times for the said \"one and only\" and it's on point perfect every single time!  Recently, I have re-tried the Pimpin' Fries (waffle fries smothered in pimento cheese) and I loved them.  My boyfriend and I ordered the White Bean & Rosemary Hummus appetizer last week. This app is a steal for $6.75! The basket they bring it in is chocked full of fresh goodies. An ample scoop of the creamy, yummy hummus; nestled by artichokes, tomatoes, chopped calamata olives, red onion, and plenty of fresh pita.  Boyfriend ordered the Uptown Tuna Melt, which he liked, but said it paled in comparison to the hummus and my veggie corn dog, ha!   Also, I give Da PImp grilled pimento cheese 4 stars.",

    "text": "Oh, the joy of fried food!  Pinky's delivers taste in a big way in a cool and funky package.  We decided to try them one Saturday evening.  About parking...don't even try to park in the small lot in front of the restaurant.  Head across the street to the larger lot available for Pinky's customers.   The decor in this place is funky and cool.  Similar to Bad Daddy's, Pinky's plays awesome music and has neat stuff all over the walls.  Even at only 6pm, this place was in full swing.  We (luckily) got a small booth near the bar and proceeded to salivate over the menu, trying to pick the best options.  Since we had heard so many good things about the crab pups, it was no question we had to try them as our appetizer.  For our entrees, my hubby got the mammoth burger - basically a double cheeseburger - with waffle fries on the side.  I got the pinky dog, topped with melty pimento cheese and chili, and homemade chips on the side.  As everyone else has stated, the pups are the BOMB.  Crispy on the outside, with a soft, crabby puppy center.  I'm not usually a fan of tartar sauce, but theirs is worth a try.  While we were initially disappointed they only cook burgers well done, my hubby's burger was pretty darned good.  Juicy, plenty of cheese, and just the right amount of toppings.  Yum!  The waffle fries could have been cooked a tad longer for added crispiness, and they needed a little salt.  My hot dog packed a punch.  It was so tasty!  And I honestly think their dogs are better than Bad Daddy's, even though they are smaller.  The homemade chips were good, but I would have liked them a little crispier, too.  The ranch dip they serve with them is divine though!  Service was really quick, even though they were slammed.  I liked that multiple servers assisted with our table, like they all pitch in to help each other filling drinks, clearing empty plates, etc.    Their prices are really reasonable, too.  We can afford to come back often!  In a nutshell, there's a lot to love about Pinky's, and we will absolutely be back.",

Packed full of personalities, tattoos, the beer flows like wine, and tons of cardiac inducing treasures to be had.   The small parking lot directly in front of the restaurant can be a bit wonky. Especially if traffic is bad. There is additional parking across the street, so keep that in mind.   I'm a huge proponent of a great greasy burger, baskets o' fries, and an ice cold PBR. Pinky's delivered on multiple fronts and the 5 stars goes to show for a slew of positives.   Vegetarian options. Holy crap, this place has it all. Veggie chili, veggie burgers, dogs....They know how to make it on the map with Charlotte's veggie pride. I was blown away by Ding Dong style. Peanut butter (crunchy), sriracha and honey-cilantro slaw? Might as well be a bulls eye. The textures and flavors make it into a faux Indian/Thai wonderland of flavor. Each bite was better than the last.   Pimp'n Fries. Whoa. You can customize these in so many ways. The ubiquitous pimento cheese reigns supreme on these bad boys. Pimpin my taste buds like it's their job.   White Trash Burger. Duuuuude. Onion rings on a burger? Sign me up. Messy, greasy, piping hot and perfect rep for the dive bar world. I'm going for the double next time.   Tons of goofy stuff on the walls, awesome booths for two, plenty of space and a vast menu of dive-y greatness. What more could a hipster ask for?",

    "text": "This quaint restaurant at the corner of Morehead and Freedom Drive appears to be a dive bar that caters to the \"non dive bar\" crowd.  Littered with bumper stickers on the ice cooler, kitchen door, and beverage cooler is home to an energy-filled staff dressed in Pinky's t-shirts but showing off their individual style south of the t-shirt.  The restaurant has posters and signs from local events covering every open space of wall real estate and the wooden furniture proves to be an inviting touch.  In here you can yell, laugh, and order filling portions of bar food designed to intrigue you enough so that you read every description on the menu (i.e White Trash burger, Pterodactyl burger, Camp Green House Salad).   Because I love seafood, I went with the Corn Dog Shrimp.  Although I usually don't have any expectations, I was surprised when my meal choice did not work out.  As I waited for my order to come to the table, I observed many plates of food passing me on middle school plastic cafeteria trays (another cool and funky style of Pinky's).  The burgers were huge, smelled sinful, and the hot dogs, corn dogs, soups, and salads I saw made me want to eat everything that passed me.    I munched down on my Shrimp Corn Dogs and realized the combination was a bad mix. The sweet corn dog batter wrapped around shrimp did not work.  I did not know if the honey mustard worked best or the tarter sauce, so I used both.  I ended up removing the bread from the shrimp and eating them separately with the condiments (shrimp and tater sauce, bread and honey mustard).  Needless to say, it left a harsh after taste in my mouth and the potato salad was not my friend.  It has a gritty look to it and an herbal taste.  If you are looking for something with crunch (red onions or celery) and herbs, try the potato salad.    Will I eat here again?  Yes, but I have to try their burgers and leave the cute, unconventional food parings listed on the menu to the more daring crowd.   BTW:  I will sit outside next time.",

I ordered the Southern 500 and she ordered The Stray Dog with the slaw on the side and cheddar cheese added. We also got an order of waffle fries and onion rings.  Ok. They were SLAMMED. It was truly unbelievable. Totally understandable to expect slower service, but even still we were waiting for food until 4:36pm. To me, it seemed there was a shift change which perhaps contributed to the delay. The kitchen guys were busting their humps and the hard-working wait staff seemed unable to keep up completely. Not their fault, really, it just seems like they could have used several more hands.  The food: My wife's soy dog was the most revolting \"hotdog\" either of us have ever tasted. I mean honestly. Barfaroni. Her slaw was forgotten and the cheddar they added was laughable. Not enough to justify asking.  The waffle fries and onion rings are awesome. Waffle fries could come in a larger portion for cost, but the same cannot be said of the onion rings. Plenty of them and deliciously fried.  My dog was awesome. Truly delicious from start to finish. The slaw is reminiscent of tartar sauce, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but definitely not what I expected.  The place has an amazing ambience. Powered by a jukebox, we were treated to lots of Slayer, Jay-Z and The Cure to name a few. Oh, and Kiss pinball. It's pretty loud inside which doesn't bother me, but you will want to speak loud and clear to be sure your unsweet tea doesn't get mixed up with sweet as mine did.  Again, I'll be back. Lots of menu items to check out. With a congenial staff and great atmosphere, it's most definitely worth a return visit.",

    "text": "When I moved here a couple of months ago, I was told to try The Penguin. I went and had a horrible experience, and the reason is that many of those people who'd made the Penguin what it was are no longer there, but at this awesome place instead.   As we drove up to street and heard our GPS yelling at us, \"location is on the left!\" we started looking around because we didn't know what to expect. I can honestly tell you, I loved it as soon as I saw it. There is an old VW Beetle parked, on the roof. Naturally, and a concrete Triceratops waiting to greet you as you park.   I gave it cool points as soon as we got parked and I could see all the small little rubber dinosaurs standing on or under Mr.Concrete Dino in the grass. Yeah I'm like a short big kid, so what??? At least I admit it. :P  We walk in to the place and it's broken into two sections. The main section is a bunch of booths and the bar, and the other side is like a tiki room of sorts with a large garage door that opens to the outside. I bet that's awesome on a nice cool day. I ordered the Herb Roasted Turkey sandwich, and I cannot remember the real name of it now dangit!! But OMG was it DELICIOUS!!!  Our waitress was very prompt, and the staff were all running around helping each other out. The food came out in no time flat, and when they brought it over my eyes had to be the size of saucers. That turkey sandwich was GIGANTIC!!! Maybe that's why the dinosaur is outside. It represents the size of the portions?   When I took that first bite I was in L-O-V-E. So, now I can't even say I like Pinky's. I have to say LOVE because anything less would be lying. I also got a Shirley Temple...short big kid, I told ya... and it too was amazing. They put a spin on it, and make it look all pretty. It's got the standard sprite and grenadine but they add in pineapple juice! YUMMO!!!  My only complaint is the parking. We got lucky and were able to grab a spot in the lot, but if we weren't that fortunate I think there is extra parking across the street? I want to go back again very soon. Or right now.. I could probably run out of work unnoticed temporarily to go there.... hmmmm....  ;P",

    "text": "After hearing so much about Pinkys from different locals and seeing it on triple d, we were in the mood for some thick juicy burgers and we're headed to another spot but we finally decided to give Pinkys a try.  We were not disappointed at all, there's very limited parking in the front so we had to park in the overflow lot just up the street. It was really loud and crowded but in a good way. The one major thing I liked is how cool the hostess, the waiters and waitresses are. It's funny because one server gave us the menu, another server took our order and a completely different server bought our food, whilst a different server refilled our drinks. The same with the cleanup, To me that just showed teamwork.. Now the food, ordered the Crabmeat hushpuppies since they came highly recommended, those are by far the absolute best hushppies I've eaten. Sweet, crunchy and golden with hints of crabmeat throughout each one. I really only wanted a simple burger with globs of onion (yeah I know), so that's what I opted for, with provolone cheese. Needless to say the burger was darn near perfect. They do have several different burger choices though. My son had the patty melt he says it was extremely good and for him to say that, it had to be good.  Overall I'd give this place a 10 and would recommend coming with your girls or a cute and wild lil date night for something different. This is not the spot if you're trying to be romantic and go home and listen to some Luther Vandross or Marvin Gay....sorry Again, I'd give it a 10 and will be back again!",

    "text": "When we travel, we like visiting local dives, so when my husband and I were in Charlotte for the Thunder Road Marathon, we hit Pinky's for some pre-race grub. I asked a bunch of friends where to eat locally, and whoever suggested Pinky's had the right idea. We usually don't go for big chains, etc.   Plus, it was convenient to downtown and had a parking lot- plus very little wait. Score!   I had the Nature Boy, which was a veggie burger. The burger was topped with cheese and roasted red peppers (interesting burger topping), and I got them to add spinach as well instead of iceberg lettuce. It was served on a sesame seed bun and pretty delicious- very large burger and filling, but I didn't leave overly stuffed.   There is an entirely vegetarian and vegan menu, you may need to ask for it, but it's *huge*. Anyone from a vegan to a carnivore can find something to eat at Pinky's and enjoy it.   Hubs had some wings and the \"white trash burger\" and seemed to enjoy it. Make sure to try the sirarcha ranch sauce- it's great. Also the prices here are incredibly cheap. It's really a steal, both of us ate for just over $20 and that almost never happens. The entrees do not come with sides but you can easily order and split some.   My only gripe was that everything was disposable, not the best for the environment. I'm sort of a hippie, but I really wish I had my burger on a plate rather than in a disposable basket. The cups/bar glasses were the only non-disposable things.   Pinky's decor is pretty amazing too- a fun VW bug outside and one on the roof, plus neat stickers and signs inside. All your senses get fed here, not just your tastebuds. Definitely check it out if you're in Downtown Charlotte.",

The food was really good pub grub style food but the main reason for the 5 stars is the service, it was outstanding!  Wasn't just one server, it was like everyone who worked in the restaurant worked together, if someone came by and saw your drink low they got you a refill.  If they saw and empty food tray they took it.  I think we had at least 4 different people work our table at one time or another.  Also highly recommend the Pimp'N Fries appetizer.",

    "text": "To the server with the red hair and bow tie tattoos: you're the worst server I have ever met in my life and I hope you quit your job and go work something else, because you're not going to cut it in the food industry. The fact that You took my order and my appetizer came out but my BOTTLED COORS LIGHT never came out really bothers me. It took me 38 minutes of sitting there just to finally get up and say something to a manager about how terrible you are. The bartender decided to walk over and tell me how she ran out of paper and never got the ticket. Lies. The manager told me the reason my food still hadn't come out was because you were down a cook. More lies. The final straw was when I informed the manager that you haven't been to my table since you took the order 38 minutes ago and she said \"Well we all work as a team here so it's everyone responsibility.\" Guess what! I'm a server! Guess what else! I work in a tip share restaurant where we ALSO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONES TABLES.  If I ever took someone's order and didn't check on them in 38 minutes, I would have been lit up by every other server on the floor + the manager. Wait wait wait, cook didn't show up and/or you ran out of printer paper? Don't give bs excuses to someone that has heard them all. It wasn't until after I said something to the manager about waiting for 38 minutes for a single beer and a burger that my stuff finally came out. Guess what! No cheese on my girlfriends \"cheeseburger\", no 3rd party on my \"Triple g\", And my waffle fries came out as an app and not my entree. Oh, and to top it all off: MY SERVER NEVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE SINCE SHE TOOK MY ORDER AND I WAS THERE OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF! Terrible service, and terrible excuses by terrible managers for a restaurant that I went to solely based off of Yelp reviews.",

Cons: Nothing too negative - food was alright.   We had the White Trash Burger, which was alright, but I was expecting something a little more \"wow\" worthy from the reviews. The pimp'n fries were a treat especially with some ranch, and I do want to come back to try the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich! It sounds delicious!  I'll give it another shot, but I have plenty more places I want to check out in Charlotte before I make my way back.",

    "text": "Pinky's Westside Grill opened a little over a year ago just outside of Uptown Charlotte.  This is a fun and casual bar and grill that occupies the former space of a Volkswagen garage on the corner of Freedom and Morehead.  The old \"Triple 'G' Automotive\" sign remains outside and the owners left an old school VW Beetle on the roof of the building.  The Beetle has been painted over with a design of the American flag.  Pinky's serves bar food (hamburgers, hot dogs, salads, sandwiches, etc.) with a creative flair.  For example, you can order a burger \"Ding Dong Style\" with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and spicy Sriracha sauce.  They've also got \"Crab Puppies\" (like hush puppies, except made out of crab) and a falafel wrap, so there's some variety.  Prices are very reasonable here with most entrees under $8 each.  I tried one of Pinky's most popular burgers, the White Trash Burger ($4.50).  It comes with a 5 oz. patty topped with provolone cheese, fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch.  While the burger is not ginormous, it is pretty satisfying.  I noticed the server didn't ask me how I'd like my burger cooked, just like my experience at Kickstand earlier this year.  I guess it's a Charlotte thing.  Regardless, the beef is good.  The bun is flat and small.  The waffle fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries are Pinky's most popular sides.  I tried an order of their onion rings plus an order of their honey-cilantro slaw.  The rings and slaw are served in BBQ take-out-style paper trays.  The onion rings are long and stringy.  The batter is a little inconsistent throughout (both crisp and soggy).  When you get to the end of the tray, it's mostly large crumbs of batter.  The honey-cilantro slaw is very good.  While there isn't as much cilantro as I like (I *love* cilantro), the slaw is fresh and crisp.  The lettuce, onion, etc. are cut shredded into several long strands and the honey-mayo (or whatever sauce they use) is applied in just the right amount so the side isn't too strong.  I'd like to try this with a hot dog next time.  While I haven't had them, my friends really like the crab puppies, falafel wrap, and \"Stray Dog\" (vegetarian hot dog), so those are other dishes that have a seal of approval.  Inside the restaurant, many tall windows give you a nice view of the Uptown skyline.  The decor is an entertaining mishmash of all sorts of things including a Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinet.  The servers are cool, the food comes out fast, and service is great.  When the check comes, they have no problems separating the bill between couples and singles.  There is limited parking available in front of the restaurant.  Your best bet is to park in the free lot across Morehead St.",

I thought that it may get a little annoying because that means that you would constantly have someone interrupting, right? Well they did an amazing job of giving us our distance as well as making sure that we had everything that we needed. I truly appreciate the service, the uniqueness of the menu, and the reasonable prices.",

Upon walking in, we were greeted and seated in a pretty quick turnaround, with minimal wait.  The parking was extremely limited, but there's a lot nearby that expands it to a few more spaces.  I went with the crowd and ordered the White Trash burger with the sweet potato fries.  The burger was flavorful, but was underwhelming in terms of portion and really, flavor.  It was good, but certainly not the knockout I had read about.  The sweet potato fries were served with a wasabi-ranch that was incredibly watery, and really was offputting in terms of consistency.  The entire meal was sort of lukewarm and just....not outstanding.    Overall, I had a good dining experience at Pinky's, but for the price charged and the outstanding reviews, came away expecting more.  Maybe worth a try to see what it's all about, but not somewhere I'd go again.",

I love the fact that you have multiple waiters for the simple fact that they all make the experience a great one. I ordered the white trash burger which was super juicy & cooked to perfection. The waffle fries are good also but next time I will skip them just for the simple fact that I was full from the  Burger & ended up leaving them behind. I also ordered a banana pudding to go which is super delicious, is not overly sweet which I personally prefer it not be. If you're just visiting Charlotte or live in the area you definitely should go try them out!",

Parking is very limited in front but there's a parking lot up the block. It was an unpaved gravel lot that was packed with cars. So first thoughts, this place must be good! Small waiting area but plenty of seating inside, outside partially covered, and patio. They maximize space by sitting you fairly close together. We ate at the bar to limit our wait time. I offered the chicken cheesesteak & waffle fries. Fries were hot & crispy! But I wasn't impressed by the chicken cheesesteak. It was OVERLY loaded with onions, peppers, and mushrooms. The bread was saggy so I couldn't pick it up to be a handheld sub. I had to use a fork. And the chicken was large chunks & not shredded. Ordered the crab hush puppies & they were good. My friend had the shrimp corn dogs were ok. There were flies but the door to the outside section was constantly being opened/closed. Maybe I'll try it again & order something different. Oh ... their alcoholic drinks looked good but I didn't partake.",

Everything was cooked to perfection. All the servers help each other out which we found cool, and they all did a great job and were very friendly. Great beer selection and a great mixed drink menu, we had a couple of local beers but they mixed drinks we saw served to other tables looking awesome.

Our waiter was attentive, but almost gave the impression that we were being rushed so the table could be flipped. All-in-all, I guess I would rather feel a little rushed than be forgotten about, so I don't hold this against them.   The food was a bit disappointing. The pimp'n fries (waffle fries covered in pimento cheese and I added chili) were the star of the meal. One of the better iterations of chili cheese fries I've ever had. After this, the meal went downhill. I got the white trash burger and felt that it was dry and lacked flavor. The waiter emphatically recommended sweet potato fries, which I felt were average at best.   The restaurant decor is eclectic and unique. There's plenty of parking around back, which is nice. It is a little loud, but not unbearable.   Overall, it wasn't necessarily a bad experience, but I doubt I will go back.",

No hostess at the front (I waited 10 minutes before going to the to go area), the to go pick area had numerous staff members arguing at the stand, and to top it all off I saw a customer get up from their table and request their check after being visibly frustrated (as were other tables) after the check was printed the waitress walked away. The customer could not believe what was going on and took her check from the printer  to the table signed it then exited.   I have no idea what's going on here but I won't be back after the way I saw the staff treat their team and customers.",

We waited maybe 10 minutes and were then seated outside. Beautiful day demanded an outdoor setting.   The menu has lots to offer, from unique burger and dig combinations, to substantial vegetarian substitutes. Usually I go for burgers, but this time I did the natures boy, a delicious, homemade veggie patty. I got it Westside, one of several topping combinations. We also ordered hush puppies and vegetarian cheddar chili fries. It was all awesome. The hush puppies are about twice the size of golf balls, the chili was well seasoned, and a perfect amount of cheese. The \"burger\" was perfectly prepared.   Given how busy they were, our service was excellent as was the food delivery time.   Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended if you're in the area.",

When walking in, it's eclectic and a little wild but clean and cute. The restaurant isn't that big and fills up fast so you might need to call ahead or get there before the dinner rush. The prices are extremely reasonable and the flavors that come with the food with knock your tastebuds out of this world! The crab puppies are a must !!!!! The crab puppies will make you feel like your are sitting on the Maryland Harbor living it up! It is filled, i mean really really filled, with sweet crab meat that they don't hold back on. The puppies are big and just amazing! And the homemade tartar sauce is out of this world. Finally- the grilled chicken salad with crispy onions is MORE THAN AMAZING it is more than OUT OF THIS WORLD, it is heaven sent!!!!!! Although there is more chicken and onions than salad it's just too good to care! I would recommend, unless you really truly honestly love onions to leave the red onions out because the fried onions do a great job. Oh and the HOMEMADE RANCHHH! A True Southern just has a special place in their heart for well done homemade ranch and this one takes the cake. Overall, this is place you must stop and try and take extra socks because the food here will knock them off! Easily! Quickly! Truly and Honestly!",

    "text": "Delicious menu, well trained allergy-friendly staff & good service are why I'm in love with Pinky's.  I went to Pinky's pretty early on, and have been a fan all along. Everything I had there was tasty from my burgers to the crazy good hummus appetizer that was more of a meal.  Then, in September '10, I was diagnosed with crazy allergies.   Which meant giving up restaurants for a while. Then, in December, after moving into the neighborhood I tried Pinky's again in the hope they could accommodate me.   Andy, one of the owners, came and talked to me about the menu and helped me pick out a meal I could safely eat, which essentially meant custom creating a salad and salad dressing for me. They were happy to do it, took extra precautions in the kitchen, have remained helpful and cautious about my meals since. Finding a restaurant, especially of the diner variety, willing to accommodate like this is always a treat - especially when it's just down the street.  If you have allergies, be prepared (as always when eating out) to have a chat with the owner/manager on duty, the servers sometimes say \"I'm not sure we can do this.\" They can - just be patient and ask. It's worth it for tasty yums!   I take all my out of town friends and family here, in part so I don't have to cook dinner one night, and partly to get everyone to try fried pickles (how I miss thee!) and to get the brave to try a sandwich Ding-Dong style.   Service can be tight, so I recommend going on off hours, especially if you have allergies - your food is more likely to get special, focused attention then. The place is *packed* Thurs/Friday/Saturday lunch and dinners, so I never go then, but love it on Tuesdays when I don't feel like cooking. Parking is limited out front, so if you don't have a handicap tag, be prepared to park across the street.",

Our food took a long time to come out. When it did two of the three things we ordered were ice cold. We had to go look for someone to get to fix this because no one ever came back to check on us. They did remake our food which was then good. When wr were done again no server. We wound up having to go walk up to the bar to pay our bill. Ridiculous. Service was horrible.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since we randomly stumbled across it while exploring a side of the city we had never been to. I have since heard many good things and checked out the menu online. I knew this was my chance to try a burger with peanut butter on it and I reserved that experience for Pinky's.  First things first, the parking lot is kind of a mess. We were lucky enough to find a spot on a busy night, but trying to get out was more difficult. There were a lot of people waiting, but having only two in our party, we sat immediately. (I wouldn't recommend for large groups on busy nights.) I got a burger Ding Dong Style and my wife got the White Trash Burger - we also split the \"Pimp'n Fries\" (pimento cheese, bacon waffle fries). The Ding Dong Burger had honey cole slaw, crunchy peanut butter, and siracha hot sauce. It was ok, I could have used a touch more hot sauce. The wife felt the same about hers. I like my burgers medium - we weren't asked and both came out well-done. The star was the fries. The pimento cheese is delicious. There are a few things that I might go back for, but the location (far from my apartment) means it probably won't be for a while.",

Went here today and had the hummus appetizer, which was surprisingly indulgent. It has some very tasty hummus, an artichoke salad, black olives (that tasted like green olives), chopped tomato and sliced red onions. This appetizer could easily be a full meal in itself. I ordered my usual falafel wrap, which was awesome as always. In the past, I have also had the vegetarian hot dog, which is also pretty delicious.   Two downsides to this place: the music selection is not to my liking (mostly pop/hip hop) and the parking is so limited, you must park across the street or way in back. For now, we are lucky that many other places nearby are out of business, so we can park in their old lots.   My sister was with me today and asked why I had kept this place a secret. It's no secret, I just don't get enough opportunities to go to Pinky's as much as I would like.  Go to Pinky's. You won't be disappointed.",

So here are the pros:  Nice atmosphere Friendly and accommodating staff Some of the food was good. Fish tacos were good. My husbands burger was over cooked and they didn't ask how he wanted it cooked. He had a good beer.  Cons: We never know who our waiter/waitress is. We have so many people who wait on our table.   The tiny little baskets that the food arrives in. I hate them. They give you absolutely no room to grub. The food a lot of the time is messy. My husbands sandwich was falling apart and there was no room in the paper basket to catch all the filling. I got fish tacos and had to ask for an additional basket to eat out of.   Plastic silverware. I can't believe it. I need a sturdy knife to cut my toddlers corn dog up and they bring me a plastic knife. Not even a well made plastic knife. And she has a little paper basket big enough to hold only a single corn dog. I asked for an additional plate to put her cut up corn dog on and they bring me a styrofoam mini plate that could fall to the floor if you blow on it.   Last time I went I got a salad. They delivered it to me and asked if there was anything else I needed it. I asked for salad dressing and a fork! Geez",

    "text": "It's always a coin flip whenever I'm in Charlotte looking for a burger, and fried pickles between Pinky's and Diamond since the whole Penguin fiasco happened.   The things I like about Pinky's is that it is easy to get to. Simple exit off of I-77 onto Morehead St. and look for the Volkswagen bug on the roof.  It is conveniently located near Bank of America Stadium, and a short drive to Time Warner Cable Arena.  The crab puppies here are a must if you're not in the mood for fried pickles, or onion rings. The sauce works perfectly with the flavor of the puppies. It is a taste that'll have you coming back. The fried pickles are just as delicious as ever, crisp and the breading doesn't fall over everywhere. The burgers come in different sizes and combinations of toppings. (I prefer the mammoth with bacon, cheese, and mayo)  If you're not in the mood for burgers, the hot dogs are a hit too, so my wife says and she's hard to please! I haven't had many drinks, only one actually and it was a bloody mary and it was really garlicy. Not complaining, I love garlic. The wait staff in all the times I have been have been nice, and kept my drink full. Can't complain. Usual meal for myself is around $12-$15 tip included.  What keeps Pinky's from a 5 star is one thing. Parking, not enough parking. I don't like having to park across the street which is sometimes full as well during lunch rush. Besides that the place is a must visit.",

There is not much parking at the actual restaurant itself, but just around the corner is a large dirt parking lot. Walking up this place just reminds me of something from the beach, back from many years ago. Super colorful and a smell of food floating through the air says come in and eat now! The menu is 1 large page on 2 sides. There are a lot of things on this menu, so be sure to check it close, you dont want to miss anything. Service was fast and friendly with help on the menu and recommendations. Nice beer list and mixed drinks too. The burgers are a thing of beauty. Huge, well crafted. The single is enough for most people. The double is certain to put you in a food coma, and the triple may put you in a real coma!! The waffle fries as an app with pimento cheese and bacon are amazing. I got the double burger, it was fresh tasting, cooked perfectly and tasted down right awesome. The slaw and chili are good southern classics. Fried squash on the side was cooked up just right, not too greasy and definitely delicious. Cool artwork on every corner. Nice outdoor seating. Nothing to dislike here. 5 stars all the way around. Vibrant.",

We (2 adults and 1 preteen boy) ordered these as an appetizer with pimento cheese and chili and we all loved them! My husband got the Pinky Dog and our son got popcorn chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. I got the Patti Melt and it was really good but our son's popcorn chicken was so good that I was a little envious. I got black beans as my side and they were SO good!",

It's smaller than I expected and there was a 20 minute wait but as soon as we sat down we were greeted and had our drinks quickly. We didn't have one server, instead whoever was nearby came over to ask us if we needed anything. The service was excellent! We got the popcorn chicken salad, regular burger, and waffle fries. The popcorn chicken is really good and their honey mustard is homemade and one of the best I've ever had! My fiance really enjoyed his burger as well. We decided to have the banana pudding for dessert and it definitely stole the show. The serving was ENORMOUS!! Definitely enough for 4 people. It was soooooo good! It's a must try if you visit!",

    "text": "After looking at restaurants to take my sister to after landing in Charlotte, we decided upon Pinky's. My sister specifically stated wanting yummy greasy food to feel like she was back home in the states so this restaurant seemed like a great option. Upon entering, we loved the punk vibe of the restaurant and the awesome music playlist. The hostess was very sweet and got us seated quickly. We then had a friendly waitress quickly take our order. We ordered drinks which were all really good and fairly priced.   The low ratings are for the actual meal. I don't know if I came here on a bad day or if I just have superior taste buds but the food here was terrible. I ordered a white trash burger and it tasted like a middle school cafeteria burger. The beef was low quality, dry and lacked any flavor. I only took 3 bites and was over it. My sister had the chili dog and that too had a terrible quality of meat and lacked any great flavor. The pimento cheese fries were good but didn't have enough cheese so many of the fries were dry. The fish taco also was mediocre. The wings were like any standard wings, nothing special.  Overall, if you want a cool vibe with good drinks and friendly service, give this place a try. If you're actually trying to eat some decent food, find another restaurant.",

I can't tell the difference between theirs and Chick-fil-a's (that's a good thing). If you like patty melts, definitely try the Maddy Paddy Melt. It's standard, but it's done extremely well. My buddy got the corn dog shrimp, which is basically a hushpuppy/corn dog bite with a shrimp in the middle.

Be prepared that it is usually loud in the restaurant, but there are things all over the walls and plenty to look at while waiting for your food. You also don't have a set \"server\" they all kind of work every table - meaning you can grab any tattoo'ed or pierced person and ask for a beer. They have some awesome drink specials and a good variety of drinks/beer. I usually take my out of town friends here if they ever visit Charlotte for the first time, it never disappoints.

Great beer selection too I cannot stress enough how good the corn dog shrimp were. The combo of the shrimp in corn dog batter is genius. I had the white trash burger and it was amazing. I didn't put it down. My only complaint is the 'medium well' patty. It was still very good and juicy but I prefer medium to medium rare and it erks me when a place doesn't allow for preference. Needless to say the wife had the patty melt and daughter got the chicken Sammy with peanut butter. I get it now. The Thai food flavors. Wasn't a fan of the Cole slaw and the shoe string onion rings aren't my cup of tea either. I thought I was getting real onion rings.  Those negatives are so minor though. I loved stopping here for lunch. The food was awesome and the best for last, the service was outstanding. Very friendly staff. Btw, that ghost busters pinball machine is the bomb!",

Immediately I wish that I had come here in a cab as they offered a variety of delicious sounding alcoholic beverages. My girlfriend and I were in and out of this place in about a half hour, which was a plus seeing that we had to catch a flight. The service was great and the food was pretty good for the type of grub they were serving.  It is hard to give an accurate review of this place on the first try seeing that we only tried their wraps and hush puppies (very good...but of course who can screw up hush puppies?). There was nothing really memorable about this place, but we will definitely be back to check-out the drinks and other food items.  Lastly, I'm not quite sure if this place knows exactly what type of establishment they are. I would love to see them in the south end side of town and open until 2:00a.m. I would also recommend this place have one side as the eating joint and the other side a bar, since it does seem to be a bit confused what kind of crowd they are looking for. Overall a \"B\" grade for PINKY'S!",

This place is about atmosphere, ambiance, and a bit of grit.  Come here to relax and tip a couple of cold ones.  Some people like to get concert t-shirts and autographs...I just want to stain my old PBR shirt with fried pickle juice and pimento cheese grease.    The food here is atypical bar fare mingled with some traditional grub.  I personally love the buffalo shrimp tacos.  The fried pickles are also a must...and they'll be sure to let you know that if you used to go to that \"other\" unscrupulous joint, that those pickles are now residing at Pinky's.  You know what I'm saying (winky face).  Sorry...couldn't picture myself typing a semi-colon and a parentheses to make a winky face.    Try this place...then come back!",

    "text": "Pinky's is kind of-sort of a local legend in Charlotte.  First of all, how many restaurants have an old school Volkswagon bug on the roof? When I was a kid, the building used to be an auto shop. My brother and I had our little fists ready whenever we drove by (remember \"punch bug, no punch back!\").  Second, Pinky's is kind of the successor to The (original) Penguin. The Penguin is a restaurant located not far away and is famous. No, really. I'm talking Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives famous. The owner of Pinky's was a co-owner of the Penguin and a chef there. The Penguin changed hands in 2010 (not really sure exactly what happened, but loyal patrons of The Penguin were LIVID) and judging by the fact that Pinky's is ALWAYS packed, they all came along with the owner & some of their menu items.  Despite the same ownership, the similarities end there. The Penguin was a hole in the wall burger joint. Pinky's is much more diverse. The menu includes fried pickles, hummus, some fabulous salads, a variety of burgers & hot dogs, tacos, corn dog shrimp (my absolute FAVORITE), and so on. Everything I've had there has been amazing, and this visit did not disappoint.  I strayed from my usual (and absolute favorite corn dog shrimp) and had one of their specials. It was a spicy chicken burrito with Caesar dressing, tomatoes, crisp romaine lettuce & loads of Parmesan cheese. It came with a side of their delicious black beans and tortilla chips. I wasn't in the mood for chips, so I ordered a side of waffle fries as well.  The wrap was delicious, but not as spicy as I would have liked. The chunks of chicken were huge & delicious. The dressing was delicious and the flavors came together well. This thing was HUGE though. I ate half at that moment and ate the other half for dinner and it was still just as good.  Graham had one of the other specials, the flounder plate. He gave me one of his hush puppies, and a bite of his fish. Everything was so good! The fish was perfectly cooked, the hush puppies were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. His portion was just as generous as mine and just as good.  Pinky's is one of the places we stop at every time we make a trip home. The food is always good, and the service is always excellent. I LOVE that I see the exact same faces every time I'm there.   Stop by and try a white trash burger, or a Spaugh burger (named after a nearby middle school) or their famous fried pickles, You absolutely will not regret it.",

They were everything we hoped they would be and will be back when the craving strikes.   This place was much smaller than expected but had a very fun relaxed decor. Prices were very reasonable and consistent with the plastic plates and cutlery. I had the vegetarian burger and it was alright, kind of lacking in flavor. My fiance had the kinda fried turkey sandwich and really enjoyed it. We also had the honey cilantro slaw which was delicious. Next time I might just have to get an order of fries and slaw all to my self and call it a meal!",

That's the negative of Pinky's barnone.  And even with that, Pinky's is, without a doubt, fan-freaking-five-star-tastic. Easily the best burger in Charlotte, one of my top-five burger joints across the East Coast, and just plain good, it has everything a fattie could live for.  The best thing you can do is get the White Trash burger, which, I've more than once, called the Redneck burger. .But try anything else. Falafel is great, the chicken variations (Ding Dong chicken, peanut butter and chicken? Say what!?) are brilliant, and the fried pickles, augh.   I think everyone else has covered what I would otherwise say. This place is a must-have, no matter what you like. It has everything, and it's a gem of Charlotte that's a must-go for anyone.

    "text": "I stopped by this place for lunch because I'd good things about it, especially about the crab hush puppies! Finding a parking spot was much harder than expected during the lunch rush. Even with the parking lot across the street there are not enough spots for everyone to park, along with trying to run across the street once you finally get a spot.  Walked inside and even though it was really busy, I got a seat at the bar pretty fast. Looking at the menu this is definitely not the place to go for the health conscious! Of course that's never deterred me before so I proceeded to order the crab puppies and a veggie dog. The hush puppies are amazing! Moist inside with big chunks of crab and a hot crisp layer of fried goodness on the outside that soaks up the wonderful tartar sauce. I could not get enough of these things! The veggie dog was also much better than I expected, it came with vegetarian chili and slaw and tasted almost like the real thing.  The crowd here is very friendly as well drawing in a nice variety of people from business men to bikers and families. The waiters and host were very nice and accommodating, one even opened the door for me when I was walking in. Sitting at the bar I had a fun conversation with an eclectic gentleman about how he thought we were too connected to each other these days with our fancy cell phones and gadgets.  You'll probably get a heart attack if you eat here too often, but you'll be happy doing it! As for me I'll have to plan visits here around trips to the gym so I can have some guilt free crab hush puppies.",

Instead of waiting for a table we were told the bar area is first come first serve. We glanced over and saw they had room for all of us to sit. We walked over to the bar and before we sat down, a female employee literally KICKED one of the bar chairs towards my co-worker and shouted at us you can SIT DOWN! she also threw her arms up like a umpire does in baseball when someone is safe. I was in shock she not only Yelled but Kicked a chair at us!  I was so embarrassed my customers had to witness this. What also makes me upset the fact I called in later that day around 7pm or so to voice my concern abut how Rude and Ugly your employee treated us. I gave my name and number and was told  this would be addressed/ made up to me. Still yet to receive that call.  Heads up if you go during lunch...you might get a chair kicked at you!",

    "text": "Native Charlotteans know any place that names a burger after Ric Flair (Woooo!) is going to be good. If getting into a figure four leg lock with The Nature Boy (Woooo!) isn't your top choice of culinary entertainment, consider taking your baby to a bar with the White Trash Burger. Either way, do it right and get any of the burgers \"Ding Dong Style\": topped with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. Pure taste bud debauchery.  The nods to Charlotte icons continue with the Pterodactyl Burger, an homage to the now razed, but well-loved by Charlotte's underage citizens, alternative music nightclub which stood directly across from Pinky's Westside Grill on Freedom Drive in the late '80s and '90s.  Owners Greg Auten, Andy Cauble and Dave Rhames are former managing chefs at The Penguin, and they've brought the ever popular Greg's Pickles (nee Fried), Hushpuppies and Corn Dogs with them. They also fought to keep the Volkswagen Beetle on top of their building, which was formerly home to Triple \"G\" Automotive, as the remaining sign in the parking lot attests.  Choices from the menu are served up primarily by heavily inked, friendly, but way cooler than you staff. Selections from the jukebox, some of them local bands, accompany the consumption of Pimento Cheese Waffle Fries, daily specials and desserts like Cheerwine Pound Cake and specialty drinks. Framed photos of the Four Horsemen, one of whom is The Nature Boy himself (Woooo!), and NASCAR memorabilia watch over it all, reminding diners to remember their Charlotte roots.  Additional parking for Pinky's is located across the street from the location at 1600 West Morehead Street in Charlotte. (Woooo!)",

I've definitely used that before.  Now their food is amazing!  Yes, a lot of friend unhealthy stuff, but the tasty goodness in your mouth is worth not counting those calories.  I always order the crab puppies, everyone should at least try it out!  Their fried squash is also amazing.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first ordered it, but I'm glad that I did because I kept wanting more.  The only burger that I order there is the White Trash Burger that has provolone, fried pickles and onion rings, and a spicy ranch sauce.  Sounds delish right?  Go and get this burger now!",

They have a great mixed drink selection and beer selection. I had the Tahini Salad and quite literally bottom less coffee since I had about 4 by the end of the meal.  The meal was quite filling and the falafel was great!! My family also was very impressed with their meals. I am definitely looking forward to the next time I go in. My only complaint about Pinky's and this could be the hippy in me. Yet, I really would rather have my food served on real plates not paper/plastic and some real silverware would be great too.  It's really hard for me to review a place that serves PBR tallboys and has a good vegan//vegetarian selection in the South.",

    "text": "Solid! My son J and I ate here for lunch today, after sending my wife to NY for a business trip.   As we walked in, I noticed this place has the ambience of a great American burger bar, with a Frankenstein poster on one wall, some Nascar remnants and a top of a beer making vat on the wall, and JBL speakers blasting some fine music at just the right level. A couple of muted monitors over the bar ran ESPN2 and some sports equipment infomercials.  Sitting down, we noticed the menu is varied enough to satisfy anyone. The beer list is great, the mixed drink list is intriguing, and I'd love to come here with a group of adults in search of a good time.   The smiling, artfully tattooed and nose-ringed waitress brought me a fresh cup of really fine coffee. My son had a Dr. Brown's Root Beer.   We shared a small order of fried dill pickles before our sandwiches arrived. They were piping hot, lightly breaded, and served with a cool ranch dip. I ate so many I had a stomach ache later. They were better than I remembered them from the old Penguin.  I had the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich, a Thai-inspired concoction of grilled chicken, peanuts, lettuce, tomato, mayo, Sriracha, and other goodies on a sandwich bun. It was hot, tasty, and satisfying.   J. had a Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich. He was stuffed and happy, having washed it down with his root beer.  The restaurant is a remodeled service station that was obviously around for a long, long, time, but it has been tastefully rebuilt, attractively furnished, and turned into a really cool, if small bar/restaurant. It was packed at noon this Sunday, with a mix of tattooed biker types, preppies, fashionable couples, and family types like us.   We'll be back with the rest of the family to sample other things on the menu. I noticed enough vegetarian-friendly food on the menu to satisfy my daughter, a very picky eater with high expectations.",

    "text": "So I went to PWG with high hopes due to the average 4 star rating out of 5. While the experience was good, it unfortunately didn't merit the enthusiasm I felt going in.   What I liked:  - Prices. The majority of the entrees are at a $7-9 range and they are generous with portion sizes. - Atmosphere. It is laid back and comfortable. They play rock music in the background and the vibe is completely unpretentious.  - Indoor & Outdoor seating is available. If my friend didn't have such bad allergies I would've asked for a patio table.   What I didn't like:  - The waitress was very unknowledgeable about veganism. I mean they are one of the few Charlotte restaurants that actually offer a decent vegetarian and vegan selection so for her not to answer basic vegan questions on the food was a bit poor reflection on the restaurant.  - The quality of the food was mediocre. I asked for the white bean & rosemary hummus for an appetizer and it was just alright. My entree was the nature boy burger and it was on the bland side. It could be salvaged with different condiments though, it just lacked some kick.  - They messed up on a bill for two. We asked for the check to be split and specified twice to our waitress on who to bill what. She came back in minutes and gave us incorrect checks. Fortunately a manager was close by and fixed it for us very quickly.   Overall, I would go back here and give it another try. My friend had the falafel wrap sandwich and said it was really good. He also liked his basked of waffle fries. From the looks of his wrap, it did look pretty tasty. I think PWG has some pretty loyal locals so I doubt my review will make a dent in their business but thought I would share my two cents anyway.",

    "text": "Whenever I feel the need to punish my cardiovascular system, Pinky's is the one place I'll go to. What's surprising and pleasant about Pinky's is that for all of the heart-attacks-on-a-bun they offer, there's quite a few healthier options to choose from. I always enjoy the Green Chile Pork sandwich, marinated pork grilled with pineapple slices, melted swiss cheese, arugula and jamaican mayonnaise on a seeded bun. Delicious! And I chase that burger down with some chili fries and a PBR. I did say \"healthy,\" right? Oh, screw it. My personal trainer can get pissed off at me all she wants.   Pinky's satisfies my craving for greasy delights, ever since the demise of the original Penguin - I still miss that joint. In fact, some of the staff from the former Penguin have made their way to Pinky's, so it's nice to see them there.   So whenever I feel the need to tell my body to go get bent, and load myself up on dripping grease and stupidly hot fried pickles, we make a bee line for Pinky's, and gladly wait for a table. It does stay crowded - seriously, I waited 30 minutes for a table at 3PM! - so get there early. Pinky's will not disappoint.",

FOOD: Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich is amazing, flavorful, delicious,  and huge. Also, the sweet potato fries are great, and you get a laaaarge amount. They really do have an extensive menu, and there were so many things I wanted to try, and vow to try in the future.  ATMOSPHERE: Hipster and awesome, but still comfortable enough for a bunch of business men to get drunk on their lunch break (gotta love those close-knit tables). Only downside? Shittah parking.  SERVICE: As attentive as she could be, considering the place was packed to the gills. Had to flag her down a few times, but that was to be expected. The ladies I was with did not appreciate her holding their bowls of soup by the lip, but that's not something I particularly care about in general.  PRICE: Very decent. I am appreciative.

We had a tables worth of people there already and were more than happy to sit down and start ordering drinks and snacks while waiting for the rest of our party to show since we were expecting to be spread out through a bunch of tables anyways but apparently that's totally not cool. And after everybody showed up and there were tables free where they could've fit all of us she separated us anyways. I don't even know what was going on there.  Now anyways, onwards to the food and drinks. I was very appreciative that they had delicious, delicious Blenheim available. The crab puppies were amazing, and I had to stop myself from eating more than was fair from my foursome's shared appetizer order. For my main I chose the corndog shrimp and they were made with huge and delicious shrimp, although I'm still not entirely convinced that slightly sweet corndog batter goes well with shrimp. Waffle fries and southern slaw were good. So overall I'd probably go again if I could make sure I'd never encounter that hostess again.",

    "text": "I have waited to post a review of Pinky's to give it a fair shake.  I'm a Westside townie, so I wanted to let them work out some kinks and try some stuff before I posted.   I'm glad I did because the first couple things I ordered were not as good as expected but I persevered and found some stuff that is crave-worthy. My hubs loves the Green Chile Pork sandwich and Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich with slaw, PB and Sriracha (and the burgers).  I like the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos a lot, though I can't get the honey cilantro slaw because I'm allergic. Usually they will cut up some cabbage and throw it in for me plain, which is nice.  The fish is fried perfectly and rivals (gasp!) Cabo Fish Taco. Way better prepared than Cantina.  The Pterodactyl burger is good and juicy and definitely outdoes neighbor Burger Co's plain burger, but inversely, Pinky's turkey burger falls short and is a bit bland. There are lots of unique ways to order your burgers/dogs so I think you'll have happy taste buds.  Greg's Pickles are exactly what you'd expect.  Lots of people LOVE the crab puppies (hushpuppies with a tiny bit of crab) but we were underwhelmed. Stick w/ the pickles or other apps.  I would suggest steering clear of the falafel. The flavor was off for me- perhaps too much coriander or similar spice? I couldn't finish it.    Service is usually friendly, but food delivery is almost always slow. Don't go here if you have a tight lunch break because they are almost always slammed. Don't assume you'll get a table right away, but it's easier if it's party of 2.  Luckily I can walk, so I don't have to deal with tough parking. Within the last couple months they opened their outdoor patio, so there's even more seating under a shade sail. I think you'll find it's worth it though with some unique menu items.",

Of course they do offer more healthy options like salads, and vegetarian sandwiches, but let's not kid ourselves, you go here for the YUMMY food... the not so good for you food.  My first trip I ordered the fried pickles, and the Tony Baloney.  I ordered it westside with chili, slaw, onions, and mustard.  It was decadent. I enjoyed every bite. The bologna is thick and meaty an the chili is made just right.  Of course, I had to eat it with a fork and knife becasue it was so messy.  The fried pickles, to me, were better than The Penguins. And, their ranch-- SO GOOD!!!  Our next trip we ordered the crab puppies- think moist, sweet hushpuppies wtih a slight crab taste. They were also cooked very well and delicious.  I ordered a hot dog all the way and a corn dog.  The hot dog was good, but the CORN DOG-- OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! It's not your typical pull out of the freezer corn dog. Its' hand breaded, and fried so that the hot dog and the breading are juicy and cooked perfectly golden.    We took a few friends, and they loved it so much, that they returned 3 days later with their whole office for a lunch.  If you haven't been, you must go! It's a crowd pleaser for sure.",

    "text": "Ahh, Pinky's.   Upon moving to the Charlotte area for the summer, my roommates and I set out to find a one-of-a-kind restaurant in the area to try out. After doing a little searching online, we settled on Pinky's and headed over to try it out.  Before I delve any deeper into this review, I have a bone to pick. There are those of you who claim that the food here is \"too fried\" or leaves you feeling sick after. This is not a healthy restaurant. You don't come to Pinky's to get a little foo-foo salad with your foo-foo strawberry balsalmic dressing and a side of foo-foo fruit. And Pinky's doesn't try to sell themselves as that kind of restaurant. With that being said, here we go.  Pinky's is terrific. You would be hard pressed to find a restaurant in Charlotte that has the kind of character and atmosphere as Pinky's. My favorite time to visit is later in the night during the summer, when it's cool enough to sit outside. It's the perfect place to sit down and enjoy a few beers and laughs with friends.  Every time I come, we always start out with an order of the pimento cheese fries to share. Yes, you heard me correctly. These are greasy, pipin' hot french fries smothered in that scrumptious pimento cheese Southerners die for. Now, I have some health conscious friends, but let me tell you that everytime we order these, it's a full-out brawl as people fight to get the last few bites. These are a must-try appetizer, and if you're feeling extra ambitious, you can add bacon and chilli.   After gorging myself with the pimento fries, I ordered the White Trash Burger. Loaded with fried pickles, onion rings, and provolone cheese, and topped off with spicy ranch, this burger isn't for the faint of heart. Just a warning...your waiter might try to persuade you into adding another patty to your burger. One patty is MORE than enough, and unless you want to induce a heart attack on  your drive home, I would advise you to steer clear of this. My roommate ordered the Tahini Salad, which far exceeded her expectations. Who knew Pinky's could also make a mean falafel? The other roommate ordered a corndog and stated that it was \"the best corndog she's ever had.\"   The servers here are great; always making sure that your glass is filled up, and never hesitate to offer their recommendations on what to get. Prices are great, and portion sizes are huge.  Pinky's is definitely worth a visit at least once during your time in Charlotte, and I think you'll find you'll be happy you came...although I'm not sure your scale will be as appreciative.",

    "text": "So I've been here twice since my move to NC. I originally tastes and enjoyed the 'old\" Penguin and heard of the transformations... So Pinky's I headed... And not to mention my father gave me the nickname Pinky since I was born.   The first visit I was starving and seeking grease to satisfy my belly. I was visiting from San Diego making my mind up whether or not to move the QC. San Diego doesn't have fried pickles and other greasy yummy morsels.   So I ordered the hush puppies, pimento cheese burger, regular coleslaw and fries... yes it was a major pig out... but I knew I'd have left overs to share later.   I really, really enjoyed that first meal...I mean really. I also had a beer and it all only come to $17 and then plus tip.   Okay... so then I return with my folks about two weeks later... and was really let down. The hamburger meat wasn't seasoned, the fries tasted like they had been double fried... the hush puppies... meh. And I know it's not a place to take my mom back to when she starts to 'play\" with her food... Moms (who we call Snoopy) is an incredible, if not outstanding cook... I mean absolutely amazing -- I won't even cook for her because I never want to see her \"playing\" with the food I made. So that is a sign too.... inconsistency seems to be a problem plagued with so many restaurants.    Not sure if I will go back... but who knows. When my sister comes down from NYC I'm sure we will go-- she's the one that originally turned us on to Penguin YEARS ago... She loves them fried pickles - me not so much as I find them salty... but that's just me. And she loves the vegetarian items....",

(he almost ordered delivery through foodie call aka he was willing to eat the $20 delivery cost, as we live in university nowhere near either location.) The fried pickles are some of the best we've ever had. The ranch dip is exceptional, and usually ranch makes me gag.  Burger meat is soooo juicy, so delicious, so so good.  Waffle fries are basically Chick fil a's. I could live on them.  Sweet potato fries are satisfying.  Don't order the onion rings, unless you're interested in eating a pound of those weird crunchy onion straw things that go on top of green bean cassarole (not saying I've never done that) Corn dogs. What an underappreciated piece of heaven on a stick. My favorite.  We love the Craft beer roulet. They basically stick their hand in an ice bucket and for $3, you get whatever beer they pull out. Great way to venture out of your comfort zone.  Just come check it out.",

We sat at the bar and shared crab puppies as an appetizer. They were so tasty and definitely a new favorite of mkne.  I ordered their soup of the day, minestrone. It was more of a southwest chili soup and I'm thinking they got the bowls mixed up. That doesn't take away from how good it was, but no way that was minestrone soup. For my entre, I ordered a shrimp salad with a side of honey mustard. Pinky's had a fun and hip environment, with lots of signs, art, and old-school games around. They have healthy food and fried food all in one.",

The falafel is great, the ding dong chicken is tasty, the West Side Randy with Grilled Chicken is really delish!!  I have also now tried the onion rings and the crab hush puppies.   Honestly, all of my entrees have been outstanding, but the sides were not quite at the same level.  The onion rings were freshly made, but not the most delicious onion rings I have ever had. (A little too skinny & stringy for my preference.)   The crab puppies were just a tiny bit disappointing - I had really high hopes for them, but on my visit, they were just a bit on the bland side and didn't have much crab in them. (I might give them another try on another visit in case it was just an off day.)  On my last couple of visits, I had really good service and was overall very pleased with Pinky's. Keep up the good work guys!",

Both were really good though I didn't taste a lot of crab in the hushpuppies, they seemed to be more bread. For dinner, I ordered the Corn Dog Shrimp basket. That's jumbo shrimp fried in corn dog batter which is just as tasty as it sounds. It came with waffle fries and a cup of slaw. The slaw was pretty good but it was a little sharper in taste than I would have preferred.   The restaurant decor is really fun and funky. Lots of tiki and retro horror kitsch stuff. They have an extensive menu of cocktails and over $2.50 drafts on Tuesdays.",

Pinky's is heading for success, it already has a comfortable feel, I can't believe they have only been open for a week, already feels established.   I sat at the bar waiting for friends and this nice guy beside me shared his pimento cheese, seasoned waffle fries. He has a friend for life now. Sharing is caring. Guess what?  They passed my french fry barometer. Need I say more?  My hot dog was delish, I tried a bite of a corndog- soooooooo good. The outer heavenly shell was sweet, light and a little bit of crunch. Corndogs are sent from heaven. Pinky's had a nice mix of customers, single fun drinkers, the child slingers and nice men who sit at bars and share their food with the ladies. P.S. I told him to start Yelping.  Our check average was $13 without tip -food and adult beverage. I think that is flippin' fantastic.  I can see we are heading for a beautiful relationship.

Friday, lunch time, ya know.   Anyways last time I went with some pimpin fries, and as an anniversary since the last time I was here I got it again with my parents. But the new thing I got instead of the mammoth burger was suggested by my fellow friend and yelper Mike. The Kinda Fried Turkey.  Ohhhhh Mike were you right!! That sandwich hit the spot. What the twist and makes this sandwich different was that basil. I think that's what made this sandwich for me. That fresh taste of that leaf mixed with the cheese and tomatoes, oh man! Good suggestion sir, good suggestion indeed.  The Pimpin Fries. It was a little different from the last time I had it. And boy was it better! It's now waffle fries as before it wasn't. Load that baby up with some chili and some bacon and you've got yourself a nice little artery blocking, but an amazing party in your mouth.   I'm definitely coming back to this place and trying some other menu items. But, definitely my default is going to be that Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich.",

I got two buffalo shrimp tacos and my mother in law got a chicken sandwich.  The fries came up fast and were just great. Sandwiches were out promptly and all of the food was top notch.  Your bill is about the same as Applebee's, but the food is thrice as good and the atmosphere makes for the kinda place you want to have extra beers at.  Great music, friendly staff, real rock music.  F#*% that's delicious.",

I rated four stars based on this experience alone.  It was Monday, and they were out of lots of beers and some drink making products. I guess it's better to run out than hold inventory? (I'm sure there are theories to support either strategy) As I hadn't been there before, I assumed the dirt lot with no signage behind the building was fair fame for parking but was a little concerned about being towed.  A sign reading it's okay to park there would be welcome to newcomers.  I'll be back.",

The atmosphere is relax and good to hang out with friends. I went with my friends and we started with the crab puppies for our appetizer. They were decent for how much they cost (13 of them for $5.50)   My friend had the Mammoth, which came with 5 oz. patties plus cheese. You can choose any kind of cheese you want for a dollar a piece. The burger was pretty bland and bad. We were super disappointed. We were warned before they cook burger well done here, but never thought it would be so dry and no flavors at all like this.   Everything they serve to you is on plastic or paper like other people said. Be aware of that.  We were really disappointed at their service as well. The service was horrible and their staffs weren't attentive at all. We came for lunch at 11.30 and got seated after 20 of waiting. Then, another 20-30 minutes of asking what would you like to drink. Another 30 minutes of food coming out. We were done at that point.  I'm sorry Pinky's but this is not for us. Not sure if I wanted to go back.",

    "text": "Visiting from out of town and found this place very easily. The parking lot was full: always a good sign! Not a whole lot of seating in the \"lobby\" if you have to wait long, but luckily they got us seated pretty quickly. Had to check out the pickle chips as I'm a fan, and they didn't disappoint. Good balance of seasoning and crispiness for the breading; although, we had to ask for the ranch dressing that's supposed to come with it. This did lead to some confusion because by this time we had seen three different servers, and I wasn't quite sure who to ask: the one who took our beverage, the one who brought it, or the one who took our food order, or the one who brought our appetizer. I see someone else commented on this, and I gather by connecting the dots that the restaurant does not have servers assigned to sections. This does make it a little confusing for the customer when you are trying to figure out who to ask for things or for that matter who you are tipping. The burgers were juicy and tasty, albeit they were lacking in the presentation. The food baskets they come in are so small that you really can't get a good look at them. Oh well, just pick them up and bite in! Ordered the White Trash and a Cheeseburger Ding Dong Style. Have to say I favored the latter. The White Trash was a little bland and really couldn't taste the sauce, but the flavor of the Ding Dong is banging: peanut butter and honey-cilantro slaw. Who would have thought!?!  We ordered onion rings as a side, and I would certainly suggest to pass on those. They're not really onion rings, more like onion straws, and even that is a stretch. The breading was falling off of them, and they were difficult to pick up. There were very few \"rings\" in the basket, too. Wish they had a description on the menu because if I knew I was not ordering onion rings we certainly would have ordered something different. One last thing to be aware of...no kids menu. I realize it's not a family joint per se, but we weren't the only ones with kids in the joint. Certainly able to find something they would enjoy, but the portion size and price for kids was a bit much.",

    "text": "Right after our big honeymoon trip (more on that soon) and after a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner the day before, Calvin, my dad and I decided to check out Pinky's Westside Grill in Charlotte on West Morehead Avenue. This neighborhood is undergoing a pretty significant awakening and I'm excited to try some of the other newbies in the neighborhood also.  Pinky's serves a good burger and offers several eclectic twists, both on their burgers and other menu items that make it stand out as a causal dining joint. In addition to the tasty beef burgers, Pinky's serves hot dogs, falafel, veggie/turkey burgers and various baskets, salads and sandwiches as well. I look forward to returning to try the corn dog shrimp, the falafel and the \"kinda fried turkey\" sandwich.  We all tried the basic burger (the Pterodactyl), which is only available one temperature (per NC law a burger cannot be prepared rare anyway). At $3.75 (without a side but including generous toppings) it is a good value. We each tried a different topping style. Topping styles include Everything (mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickle), Westside (mustard, chili, slaw and onion) and Ding-Dong Style (crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce). I tried the Ding-Dong Style and loved it! Of course, having come from Thailand it was rather ironic that the waiter described it as their \"Thai style\" burger. We also shared some crab puppies as an appetizer - sweet crabmeat folded into large hush puppies and side orders of southern slaw, onion rings (more like straws) and fried squash. The sides didn't really stand out - the onion rings and squash were sliced too thin for my taste but maybe others like them this way. I preferred the cilantro-honey slaw on the burger to the southern style slaw. The only other negative is that the place is rather loud, although not as bad as some. I look forward to dining here again on the patio when the weather warms up in the spring!",

I have tried some of this cities craziest fried foods...that being said, I know if something has been cooked properly. Would you eat a steak that was a chard nugget of flesh? Well of course not! You would ask for your money back.  I was with a group of about 9 people. Each one ordered a different type of fried item from the menu. So it is fair to say we sampled everything available.  I'm not sure who was in the kitchen that day, but I'm sure they had to have never seen a how to cook anything in oil.  At the bottom of each of our baskets there was a pool of burned old oil. Literally a pool! Not just a couple drips, but tablespoons of it.  Each item had a funky taste due to the use of the old oil.  One of the most basic things a greasy spoon style establishment should have on hand is fresh cooking oil. If you can't get that right, who is to say the tap lines for the beer aren't cleaned properly?  Save your money here and head back to The Penguin or The Diamond.",

It would be nice if it was a little larger, but hey, we're just happy to be outta' the trailer.  The chips are nice and crispy, but quite bland; perhaps this explains the pissed off cretaceous period in the parking lot.   The fries are good as are the fried pickles.

    "text": "This was actually my third attempt to eat here. The last few times I came in a group, and we left because we didn't feel like waiting for a table where we could all sit together.  I came with a pretty good group from work, and as before we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table. We ended up getting split into two groups, but whatever. We were sat at a table outside, which was perfect since it was a nice day.  Disclaimer: since I am apparently the only person in Charlotte who never hung out at the Penguin, across from Thomas Street Tavern, I went in without any baggage of nostalgia for the old days.   Once seated, service was prompt. Most of our table started by ordering beer. I have very specific taste in beer, and am not particularly drawn to craft brews, so I didn't really find anything for me. Ended up going with a coke. It was quite refreshing. I noticed that everything seemed fairly cheap. I ordered the \"white trash burger\" based on a recommendation from one of my friends. This was when I realized why the food seemed cheap: no sides are included. I took this as a sign and decided to skip the side today.  The food arrived fairly quickly, I assumed. I didn't really pay attention, really, but it got there before I got annoyed, so it couldn't have been long. Looking at the burger I was relieved I didn't go with a side. It was pretty greasy. Soggy greasy, to be perfectly honest. Also, I thought the bun looked a little sad. Pretty much looked like a cheapo supermarket hamburger bun. It did turn out to taste pretty good, if not a bit undistinguished. I think all the ingredients kind of blended together, so nothing really stood out. It was generally good but not particularly good.   I am sure I'll be back to Pinky's because it's close to work and has decent food. I'm not sure I would personally go out of my way to go there otherwise.",

The servers had a team game plan so someone was always asking if we needed anything but it wasn't over whelming.  We had the ancho chile wings and they were really good, a little heat but not too much and the wings themselves were well cooked.  We also had the crab pups which are hush puppies made out of crab cake type stuff and they were ok buT I'm not a huge fan of fried stuff.  We also got the Greek pita with chicken, Maybe the highlight of the meal.  All of the food was better than your typical bar food and very reasonably priced.  The only flaw I had was their beer selection was a little ho hum.  A few craft beers but nothing stood out.  I would had given five stars but they needed a bigger variety.    We would go back for sure to try a burger.",

    "text": "Man, did I want to love this place. It has a cool atmosphere, friendly service, good beer selection, and a menu that had me wanting way more than I could eat. This is just a fun place to be.  As an appetizer, we had Jalapinkies, which were quite delicious and imaginative. Jalapenos stuffed with pimento cheese, dipped in corn dog batter and fried. They were huge, but I managed to eat more than one because they good. The crab hush puppies and fried pickles we ordered were popular too.  So this seems like a fairly glowing review so far, why did I only give it 3 stars? The burger. I'm a burger fanatic and I'm always looking for new and fun burger flavors. I'm not picky, I'm not a snob, but I do have some standards.  I ordered a Triple G burger Ding Dong style. That's a 3 patty burger with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. It sounded amazing, but there's a snag, they only cook the burger patties to a particular doneness. OVERdone.   The dry burger patties overpowered the toppings on the burger that originally made it sound so appealing in the first place. I decided to remove a patty to see if I had less meat, would the other flavors come thru? Nope. Maybe one patty. Not much better.  I did have a bite of the bun and found the combination of runchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce to be a great idea. It's too bad the overcooked meat was the most dominant flavor. I was disappointed.  If this place fixes how it cooks it's burgers, it would definitely be a must stop whenever I'm in Charlotte.",

For those that haven't been, Pinky's occupies a restored car repair garage - has kind of a retro-Americana vibe but is also quite bright due to the lage windows. Seating is a bit tight, but overall it's a fun place.   The back story of Pinky's is the old chef from the Penguin (Greg) moved across town and opened Pinky's. As a result, some of the menu is a carryover from the beloved Penguin while other items are net new (especially the salads!). For example, the out-of-this-world friend pickles are here, as are the tasty burgers.   However, what sets Pinky's apart are the new food options - the funky burger combo's, the excellent hot dogs, and the cool vegan options (Falafel and Veggie Chili). On this visit I had a double Ding Dong burger - two 5 oz patties topped with chunky peanut butter, cole slaw and Sriracha sauce. Yes, it sounds like a weird combo, but is exceptionally tasty (think Pad Thai sauce on a burger).   My buddy had the Southern Chicken sandwich and gave it a thumbs up. Service was good, not fast but also not as inconsistent as others have found.   Overall this is a good option for those looking for a good burger, great sides and some solid items for the non-burger lover.",

Went after work Monday around six, parked and as I opened my car door I heard the beautiful music of Megadeth coming from the restaurant BIG PLUS. Was with a group and we ordered a few appetizers: Fried pickles, sweet potato fried, onion strings and fried green tomatoes. Which were all great, my favorite being the fried green tomatoes they came with an awesome horseradish dipping sauce. Knowing that one of the guys from the original Penguin opened Pinky's I had to get a burger, so I went with the White Trash burger...the name grabbed me. At 4.50 it may have been the best burger for its price I have had, it had fried pickles, fried onion strings, provolone cheese and I believe there was some bacon in there too. The flavor punched me in the mouth and I loved it.   The food was flavorful and affordable. The restaurant is very hip and the music played here is GREAT. Which means a lot to me, being able to enjoy a meal to Public Image Limited opposed to Katy Perry is such a relief.",

The size is big but not massive, perfect for not feeling like a worthless sloth afterwards.  I paired it with waffle fries which were perfect for collecting up pimento cheese that had squirted out of the burger.  As far as burgers go in the area, it's difficult to beat out Pinky's Westside.    The location is in an airy space with quirky decorations, but more importantly, they had a great beer list of craft brews.  So now, you're pairing great burgers with high ABV craft beers?  That's a recipe for success if you ask me.  I'm eager to return to sample the \"Weiner Wonderland\" menu of unique hot dogs, as well as gorge myself on a burger ding dong style (because like pimento cheese and bacon, sriracha makes everything better).",

    "text": "Pinky's is one of my go-to spots to eat in Charlotte. We usually hit this place after blowing quarters on House of the Dead and pinball at Abari. The food and service is just always very good, and we've been there three times.  I would say the best thing to get is their wings; get them extra hot if you dare! I recently tried a double cheeseburger, \"ding dong style\". The flavor was definitely unique, but for a more filling stomach, I would recommend you get the wings and waffle fries -- they have good flavor and aren't very pricey.  It can be ultra crowded at times, but Pinky's is a really fun place to eat while in the Queen City, especially for the wings alone.",

    "text": "So I asked my fiance to pick me up my fav salad, (Popcorn Chicken Salad), from Pinky's. As I was eating it,I noticed that it didn't taste the same and wasn't as good. The last time couple of times  I had it they used, fresh Romaine lettuce and had fresh onions and fresh chicken. This time they used a soggy Spring mix lettuce (which I hate) and it only had one piece of onion that wasn't fresh. Being that I was hungry, I decided to keep eating it, only to chew on something that scratched my tongue. I spit it out and it was a piece of friggin plastic. I'm so livid right now. Although Pinky's has been one of my favs, I don't think I will be able to go back because of this. Not sure if they have new cooks and or staff but that is totally unacceptable.",

It's located on a busy 4 way stop corner there is very little parking in the front, but a massive gravel/dirt lot in the back of the restaurant. When you walk in you immediately notice the slightly grungy look. I personally love it - it has a lot of character. The restaurant used to be a car repair shop and the old bones are visible from the outdoor space that has the original garage doors. The outdoor patio area is my favorite place to sit when it is busy. My husband likes to order the pterodactyl which is a burger ding dong style - which is a fresh burger patty with crunchy peanut butter , honey cilantro and siracha - sounds strange, but he says it's delicious! I love the falafel sandwich and I order it with homemade chips on the side and it comes with the most amazing homemade ranch dressing.  The food is inexpensive, delicious, and the whole restaurant is an experience worth checking out!",

I got the kickin-chicken tacos and I can honestly say I have never had anything better!  I ordered 2 and could only eat one!

Hubs got the hot dog with chili and pimento cheese- guess the fries weren't enough! ;) Food is top notch but they don't stop there! The service is like none other- you don't have just one server- you have the whole service team! Extreme attentiveness without being obnoxious! Atmosphere is laid back and upbeat!

    "text": "I know I am in the minority on this one, but I would be lying to myself if I didn't say that this has to be one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a very long time. It really is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to eating here.   It all started with the service. We put our name down and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We asked if the outside was shaded etc. she told us that they had a gorgeous patio with fans shade umbrellas etc. so we said outside would be fine. After 15 mins she took us to a patio with no fans, no shade and a bunch of smokers. We told her that would not work and she accommodated us elsewhere. (After another 15 minute wait.)   The food was beyond subpar. It was downright nasty. I ordered their chicken sandwich. (Supposed to be one of their most popular with peanut butter, slaw, siracha and so on.) When I got my sandwich the grilled chicken was chewy and tasted like what you would get at the school cafeteria. My bun was most likely made by wonder bread. My fries were undercooked and soggy.   To top off the bad food we didn't have good table side service. It was like they wanted to flip our table so fast we had a different waitress asking us every 30 seconds what we wanted to eat before we ordered. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND TO LOOK AT THE MENU!    To top that off I went home feeling sick and got mild food poisoning. I will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone.",

They have all sorts of art, pictures, and random trinkets and such which adorn the walls, a pinball machine and claw grab game up front, and a great porch seating area which was just recently extended!  For food I will usually stick to something like a hot dog or burger, but you absolutely MUST get it \"ding-dong style\". Ding-dong style is adding crunchy peanut butter and a sriracha slaw. **MIND BLOWN**. They also have vegetarian options, if that's your thing. The Pimp'n fries are a good appetizer (waffle fries covered in pimento cheese) and they have killer sides from waffle fries and sweet potato fries to onion rings and cilantro-honey slaw.  As far as drinks so, I usually stick with the beer specials (I want to say $2 16oz-PBRs every day), but my wife and all my friends swear by the ginger margarita.  A definite must if you're looking for a place that pretty uniquely Charlotte.",

Their wings are super flavorful, the popcorn shrimp batter is beyond delicious, and the kind of fried turkey is something you just can't get anywhere else. You honestly can't go wrong with anything here.   They have different drink specials every night of the week and the blackboard always has some cool concoction to try on the board. Even their soups are out of this world! I think my husband and I would eat here once a week if we could. I highly recommend the kind of fried turkey sandwich and either go for the fried pickles or the fried squash. As for dressings/dips....the wasabi ranch is hands down the best on the menu (in my opinion).   Do yourself a favor and if you're thinking about checking this place out, just do it. Park in the dirt lot behind it on morehead street and enjoy!!",

    "text": "So after only being in North Carolina for a few hours, we had been told to visit Pinky's as a good lunch spot several times. So of course, we had to try it out. The reviews online were all good and the food (mostly bar food) looked pretty good. Upon arrival, there was about a 20 minute wait, and the restaurant was packed which is always a good sign, right?   After being seated outside in the patio area we had our orders taken by some friendly servers, which made the experience even better. After order apps and our entrees - we had about a 10 minute wait and out came our food. I want to say that it was decent. It wasn't overly amazing but it wasn't bad either.  I guess it's something you have to try at least once but honestly nothing really stood out to me about the food.",

They can't crank out food any faster.  Even with an expediter and two food runners, if you come during lunch rush you're on lock-down due to their bandwidth limitations.    It's chaos but we tried to be patient.  It was a 20 minute wait in the lobby.  Fried pickles made it to the table about 30 minutes after ordering. Another 10 and got our burgers.  Maybe I'm missing the point but to get in and out for a burger and under seasoned, undercooked fries an hour and a half is extravagant.  With the rock and roll decor I wasn't expecting 90's booty music and pop to be played so loud.  It's weird watching families eating burgers with their kids while \"Let Me See That Tootsie Roll\" is blaring.  I must be getting old because I hate walking out of lunch completely deaf from the music.    The whole experience was lost on me so I'll get my burgers elsewhere and leave this place for the tourists who saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and the diehard local fans who can see something I can't.",

There are a lot of stickers everywhere, lots of eye candy to explore while waiting for your food.  The service was fast and efficient.  No complaints there.  Our food was good, but I've yet to have \"the\" dish that helps me understand why this place is always so wrapped up.  I had a Carolina style cheeseburger, and it was good!  A friend had the shrimp corndogs and they were way too bready for her.  My daughter got the shrimp tacos and they were really good.  I think if you are really craving greasy food, this is a great choice, but be warned, it can be heavy.",

I was pleasantly surprised that the most expensive burger was around $8!  This is a cool restaurant - decorated with all sorts of funky art (some for sale) and other cool items.  We opted to sit outside and I was happy that the outside seating had a canopy to protect from the sun. We both ordered the white trash burger which is a 5 oz burger with provolone, fried pickles (which were delicious), very thin onion rings and a spicy ranch sauce which was just enough for you to taste but not enough to drown out the other ingredients.  The waffle fries are amazing with just the right amount of salt to make them go well with the burger.   I will definitely visit again to try other items on the menu. Very glad to see they had turkey burgers and Vegan burgers on the menu as well.",

After seeing it on the side of the road, it did not take much research to discover they have some serious street cred and rock-solid reviews. The Guy Fieri poster hanging inside solidified my intuition that this place was worth checking out. If it is good enough for a TV show, who am I to argue that? Anyhow, I asked the bartender what their best selling burger was and ordered that, which was the White Trash Burger. A juicy, five-ounce patty with provolone, fried pickles & onion rings, and spicy ranch sauce, you know, all the essential food groups. Since they serve their burgers without a side, I opted for a full ginger tuna salad, since I'm a growing boy and need my veggies. And there were a lot of veggies! It was an enormous salad. The person who cleared my empty containers even congratulated me on finishing everything. I took it as a compliment, but maybe I should have asked for a t-shirt. Check them out! Mighty tasty and well worth the trip.",

We had trouble getting service for some reason, very slow. When our drinks came the beer was warm, as if it had been sitting in wait to be brought to us. I actually had to get up and ask someone to exchange it for a cold one.   Nobody came to check on us after our salads were delivered, to ensure we were happy, or to see if we wanted anything else (would have been nice to grab another drink).   We expressed our discontent to our server and word was promptly communicated to the manager and seemingly all of the other wait staff. The manager explained that they group manage tables (and share tips), and she usually makes rounds in the dining room to ensure quality, but the air conditioner had gone out which prevented regular rounds.   She totally redeemed herself and the establishment by apologizing and explaining things, and covering our drinks (she wanted to cover the entire meal but I insisted to pay for the particularly delicious Tahini Falafel Salads - they were unbelievable). Most of the wait staff also visited the table at some point to apologize as well, much to our surprise. Really genuine people.",

Kids liked the corndog's and the wife liked her patsy melt.  2 star review is due to the terrible service. We placed our order and never saw our waitress again...No one came to check on if our food was good (which it wasn't) or see if we needed more water. Brother-in -law's sandwich was wrong, ordered drinks that just never came, multiple people sat with an empty water, even tho we asked for a refill when our food came.  The waitress that we were able to flag down was nice enough to take all the wrong or items we didn't receive off our bill, and bring us our corrected check. Mix the terrible service with the ok/ warmish food and add that the bill still came out to almost $100, I won't be returning. It's a disappointment that is for sure, really wanted to like this place seeing it is in our new neighborhood.",

    "text": "Food: 4/5- It is worth mentioning that this place DOES offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options. I'm always on the lookout for these kinds of establishments due personal health issues so it's great that they offer a variety here.    So I've had the veggie burger twice before and the sauce the last time was a bit much for my taste but I also never eat spicy food at all. Other than that, I ate a perfect veggie burger with a gluten-free bun. As far as the bun goes, if you can live with eating gluten, eat a normal bun. If you have much experience with trying to find good gluten-free bread, you'll know what I mean when I say these buns are udi's shelf brand; aka dry as all get out. I will applaud the effort to make them less dry though because they put some butter (or something like that) and heated it up so it's not too terrible.    I guess I shouldn't complain much about this but I ordered a house margarita and it's pretty bad; it didn't have enough ice, it was really bitter (even more so than margaritas at a mexican restaurant), and I tried to put the salt around the rim in to make it better and that was a horrible idea, it got worse.  Venue: 3/5- Small, good for groups of 1-4. Pretty cool, punk rock atmosphere. The only issue I have is that the seats aren't super cozy to sit on and don't wear open-toed shoes; as soon as I tried to sit down I had a painful encounter with the metal, pointy table-stand.     *dress for the temperature outside as they don't have a ton of a/c (or heat for winter, if I'm remembering correctly).  Service: 5/5- I have never been unhappy when coming here. This is my third time in the restaurant and the waitors/waitresses are always just so nice, so friendly, and quite helpful.",

There are maybe 5 people in the whole place, two tables in use on their huge new patio. We like to take our dog with us to places that have outdoor seating so we didn't think it would be an issue. My husband goes inside to ask for an outside table and he is told they don't allow dogs on their patio. This really annoyed me. Like I said large new patio, Sunday morning with only two tables in use, but I'm not allowed to have a member of my family out there when she is a very well behaved dog. Sadly this will greatly affect my desire to return here even to come for lunch or dinner in the future, which is annoying since this is one of the few restaurants on west end.",

(I haven't had the Ding Dong burger but have heard it's pretty dang good as well. I might be adventurous enough to try that someday... Maybe.)  Cheese fries: Yes, get those also. But again, gut bomb.  Corn dogs of any sort: Hell yeah. Get those too.  Atmosphere: Super laid back, hipster, casual and diner-ish. I went there today after not showering for 2 days and no one seemed to care. (Let the judging commence...)  Pricing: Average, affordable diner food pricing. ($22 for 2 meals and 2 soft drinks)  Service: Spot on! Did not have to ask for anything at all as our server was seriously on top of everything. Also, on our way out the door today after lunch, we were told \"Have a good one!\" and \"Thanks again!\" by several of the employees. That really goes a long way for me.  And lastly... Why are the \"Shrimp Corn Dogs\" not called \"Shrimp Puppies\"??!! It is just beyond me. It would be such a cute little name for those delicious morsels of fried battered shrimpness. It just makes sense. (Yeah, go ahead and get those too.)  **Oh! Almost forgot... park behind the building in the gravel lot or else you won't be parking anywhere.",

Burger was awesome and fresh. Corn dog shrimp was amazing. Waffle fries were made from frozen of course and just warm, but overall the food is what will make me possibly come back.

I enjoyed they wide variety of music playing (I heard everything from Michael Jackson to Iron Maiden to Jay-Z).  There was a pretty good Friday beer special called the \"Craft Beer Roulette\" where you get a randomly selected craft bottle for $3.  I paired that up with a pterodactyl burger.  I got it ding dong style, which includes slaw and crunchy peanut butter.  I was intrigued by the idea of a burger with peanut butter on it, and was not let down.  It was awesome!  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars was the service.  We had no fewer than 4 of the wait staff stop by at various times during the meal so it was really unclear who was our primary server, and there were a few instances where we needed things and couldn't get the attention of any of them.  But the shaky service one this one occasion is not enough to keep me from going back.  All in all, it was a great experience and I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, greasy, delicious burger.",

But Pinky's stands up to the comparison and... dare I say it... may even be better.  Penguin regulars will see many old friends on Pinky's menu, which includes fried pickles and \"Pinky's Westside,\" aka a small block southern style. Tastewise, they hold their own. But Pinky's is striking out on its own, too. There are waffle fries on the menu, which are always welcome, and there are even--GASP!--some healthy options. The \"kinda fried turkey\" sandwich is delicious, with flavorful, perfectly poached turkey and bacon. The Nature Boy, Pinky's version of a veggie burger, is clearly housemade, a nice alternative to the Boca burger afterthoughts most restaurants throw at the vegetarians in the room. There's something for everyone on the menu without feeling like they threw everything on there.  I'll always have a soft spot for the Penguin, but with more options, air conditioning and *almost* enough room for the hungry customers, I think it's safe to say Pinky's will do just fine on its own.",

    "text": "Weird experience! I was excited to try Pinky's after seeing them on triple D. I went with a friend today and the experience was very strange! We were seated at an end booth, which dead-ended against a wall.  In other words, you could not walk past the table, you had to walk down and turn around to go back. After taking our order, our server disappeared. After that, a procession of people who worked there kept walking down to our table, looking at us, and then walking away. Some would stop and take things from the table, but most just looked. They came so often I finally asked one of them what time they closed as I felt they must want us out of there (it was 1:30 in the afternoon, but I thought perhaps they only serve breakfast and lunch). She said they closed at 11:00 p.m. A guy, one of the looky-loo's, asked if we were going to have anything else before I was even done with my burger. When we said no, he brought the check. Definitely felt like we were being rushed out of the place. I don't know why. There wasn't a wait and there were plenty of empty tables. The burger was o.k. I had the White Trash Burger. The fried pickles and onions rings on top were cold. The burger itself was juicy and tasty. Overall, it was just o.k. The constant stream of people walking down to our table was uncomfortable and ruined our lunch.",

A great eatery and the prices are very very decent and it was nice to see the menu has expanded and offers some new creations but keeps it very american with a twist of fun.",

    "text": "Bah humbug, here comes the Grinch. I hate to always rain on the parade, but Public Enemy said it best; \"Don't believe the hype\"! I wasn't caught up in the allure of what happened with the whole \"Happy Feet\" fiasco. So I'm judging it for what it is; unadulterated and raw.  Pinky's is a fine example of what happens with a clone or franchise. It's never as good as the original. I live across the street, but Pinky's is not the neighborhood locale. I love the decor, appreciate how they restored the original building, love the ambiance, hip crowd, pin up, rockabilly style that the employees rock but that's about as far as it goes.   Good beer selection with great prices don't get me wrong, but as far as food, just your average run of the mill bar. The best item I had was the pimp'n pimento fries. The chicken wings were nothing special, a little soggy actually. While they were very meaty, they weren't the least bit crispy. The fish tacos were even worse, a little too fishy tasting.   In a nutshell, Pinky's is a really cool spot to hang out at though. A good place to grab a drink, but not necessarily a prime spot to grab some grub. I guess that might be why it's classified as a diner on Yelp. Definitely worth checking out though. They really do have some unique menu items that will appeal to almost everyone.",

Very cool, and yet a little too cold inside maybe the heat wasn't working all that well but still I can see the appeal to sitting here on a nice day/night out!!   We started with the Waffle fries with Pimento- Soo Good!! The fries were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of cheese on top!! I then moved on and had the Pterodactyl Burger with Cheese and Bacon- Meh it was good but the one at the Penquin was better (could've been the grease from all the years)!! I also had the Hotdog with just Sauerkraut-Good!  My Man Friend had the Buffalo Shrimp Tacos- Also Good!   The service was just like it was at the Penguin and Im glad! It wasn't like some restaurants you go to and your server really hasn't a clue as to whats going on, so I was happy that everyone felt at ease with this new place just as much as I did. I will be back soon and look forward to trying other things on the menu!",

Because we had a child and needed to seat her at the end of the booth due to limited seating, we were seated in the back area near the old garage doors, where there was a draft. We all kept our puffy winter coats on as we ate our dinner.  We ordered fried pickles and burgers. The staff was attentive and kind, very on top of things so at the very least they deserve props for that, howeverThe food was not that good, way too greasy (It messed my stomach up and thats hard to do) the burgers tasted a bit off and the fried pickels were insanly greasy. The places wasn't really enjoyable enough for me to return.  The one other positve thing I can say is that they had a great beer selection, something for everyone.",

I was born and raised in the south so i love my sweet tea but tonight it was so sweet you couldnt swallow it. Trying to be nice we ask the waiter to bring us 1 glass of unsweet so we could mix in with our glasses he acted like he was bothered kinda had an attitude the whole time with us uhhhhh. Then to top if off sat behind a group of yuppies who thought it was cool to cuss every other word and talk as loud as possible. Some people actually do bring there children in there to eat but not pinkeys fault just the kind of people they attract sometimes. Hopefully just an off night love places like this I will give them another shot",

    "text": "What a treasure this place is.  If you've tried fried pickles, maybe at a county fair or similar cultural event, this is the best place in Charlotte I've found thus far for them.  And it's not just those - sweet potato fries, waffle fries, huge glistening chicken breast filets on a sandwich bun...  It's comfort food in all its greasy fried goodness, open late, with great - I mean great - wait staff.  Managing lots of tables with ease, refilling your drinks on or ahead of time, and not making a peep when you come in 15 minutes before the official closing time.    Prices are very affordable, some even surprising.  It's got a definite vibe to it, with tattoos aplenty, oddball music choices, college kids tossed in, and food names and descriptions that hold nothing back.  It's an experience, and a good one.  They even offer vegetarian choices, and quite a few of them - odd for the greasy menu, but still a welcomed attribute.    It does leave you wanting a bit less grease - you might feel sick if you consume more than half of a large fried pickle, for instance - but you know it's worth it.  Could use a few more 'normal' menu options, but I can't complain - they do what they do, and they do it very well.    Find it, stop in, and enjoy.",

    "text": "So I dropped in here for lunch this week with the wife to see what all the fuss was about.  Having followed all the drama in the paper about what this place to become and how it almost became the \"new\" Penguin, I figured it was time for a taste test of my own.  First of all, the parking is an afterthought that should have been a first thought as the location is not \"neighborhood friendly.\"  The corner of Freedom and Morehead is not exactly the place you want to be darting across the street.  With only 6 real parking spots in front of Pinky's, the logistics of parking is something to keep in mind.  I found parking in a grassy lot off Morehead, just past the restaurant.  This space seemed like a go to for others as well.  I have no idea if this is 'legal' parking space, but my car was still there when I got back and there were no nasty-grams on the windshield, so...  Moving on to the actual space, I quite liked the interior decor.  It was a mix between a bar, a man-cave and a tiki hut, all stuffed into a garage-type space with a juke box thrown in for good measure.  Where you sit will actually determine which theme you get.  My favorite were the two-seater booths adjacent to the bar, small and compact, but just enough space for a cozy lunch with non-stranger.  I was glad to see a hostess station at the front door, something needed at more of the popular dives in town.  We were seated right away, being only a party of two.  I'd be leary of going here with a much larger party, not only did they have to wait, but pushing tables together here would be a little like one of those puzzle mazes- move the pieces around until the picture is formed.  Service is attentive but very casual, most of the servers wear their body and facial piercings proudly along with their black t-shrts with Pinky's logo.  Just part of the local color as far as I am concerned.  I am very glad to see servers use the team approach- as in the person who took your drink order may not take your food order and also may not be the person who brings the food to the table.  This always makes me feel very \"taken care of\" and ensures drinks are refilled and food is served as soon as it comes from the kitchen.  The menu is broken down into sections- apps, salads, burgers, dogs, and other sandwiches.  There is no consistent theme to the menu- from fresh falafel to a thai-style melange of toppings for your burger or dog.  This is not to say it's bad, just know that the options are plentiful and different.    I had the Falafel wrap and it was a little wimpy for me.  Falafel patties were a bit too mushy and the wrap was too big for the contents of the sandwich.  Slathering in too much tahini sauce did not help fill the void either- it just overpowered the other tastes.  I did not finish mine.    Now my wife had a burger and it was quite good.  Cooked nicely and the bun was a perfect mix of soft and chewy without being a total mess.  Did not try the Ding-Dong style , so I have no comments for this.  Something about peanut butter on a beef burger just didn't do it for me.    Sandwiches do not come with a side- you need to order separately.  Waffle fries were nice and crispy.  Note that a single order is enough for two to share- and they should be at a price of about $4.  Another tempting option was sweet potato fries- they will have to wait for another trip.  Do not skip appetizers, though.  Seriously good friend pickles with a proper ranch sauce should be a must for most.  Thin-sliced pickle chips in a crispy friend batter, they way the should be.  No pickle spears, no wimpy breading.  This is a highlight for Pinky's.  I might just agree with others: these are an improvement over The Penguin's version (sacrilege, I know).    The bar has quite the selection of beers, including PBR tall boys.  Many micro draft selections abound too.  Had it not been a business day lunch, I'd have definitely had a beer with the pickles.  However, I do give Pinky's props for serving the huge glasses of tea or soda.  No frequent refills needed.  So yeah, there are some issues here.  But I also found quite a bit to like.  Now as you might can piece together from our meal selections, this is not a place to be calorie-conscious- though you might could make it work with their salad selections (but then you'd miss all the really good stuff).  But sometimes you just have to follow the flavor, and Pinky's definitely has the start of something good there.",

When it comes to what to get, let's not forget about the Deep Fried Pickles, the Ding Dong Burgers, Waffle Fries that are through the roof in flavor and crunch, Corn Dog Battered Jumbo Shrimp, Banana Pudding, Southern 500 Dog, Da Pimp, White Trash Burger, Pimento Cheese Fries and more! just sit back and enjoy the fun and cool atmosphere when you get here and enjoy some great classic food, this place rocks!",

I understand wanting the entire party to be present but felt he was extremely rude about the whole situation. So we decided to sit at the bar so we could start having drinks while we waited. The bar tender was even worse! She had a complete attitude to us the entire time for no good reason. We are paying customers and did not deserve to be treated so rudely. She slammed our condiments on the bar, seemed annoyed the entire time by our presence and was in general completely unpleasant. Her bad attitude completely ruined the mood and how good the food was. Pinkys should consider training their staff on customer service. That is a huge downfall of this potentially great restaurant.",

Aww man, imma telling you, if y haven't, just go to Pinky's!   (This guy proceeded to tell me how fabulous the restaurant is for a good 5 minutes. Damn. I better go...I didn't want to let him down!)  Pinky's is like a traditional diner...but so much more! Loud, eclectic music, tattoos friendly servers, nice retro tiki infused decor, lots of drinks and cheap, delicious grub.   The crab hush puppies are just what everyone says they are. Deliciously soft and tender on the inside, with plenty of crab bits, nicely crisp exterior. The batter and crab is slightly sweet, and the tartar has a nice creamy tang. Big portion for the price.   Veggie chili dog: dios mio! The soy dog is dee-lonk-u-lous. I'm a meat eater, but didn't feel like the heaviness of a meat dog. The soy is slightly smoky, the chili flavorful and the slaw sweet and crunch. I like their buns, steamed and sort and perfectly squishy.   Squash Chips: my only criticism is I'd like the slices to be a bit thicker for squash taste...but other than that, also delicious. Not too much batter to weigh things down. Comes with a cool ranch.   Falafel sandwich: can run with the best of em. Flavorful, lots of depth from hummus and pickled veggies.   Banana Pudding: this is the super creamy kind-- not too yellow, lots of banana slices and vanilla wafers. The bananas were a bit too brown in some spots...but that's what bananas do when exposed to air. Delicious and rich.   The servers are efficient and friendly, will make suggestions if asked. Liked the plastic disposable plates, which made things easy and super casual.  The bathroom is super clean and surprisingly upscale.   Our bill was less than $26 including a sweet tea. We left stuffed and happy and planning our next visit and what to order!",

If you find yourself in the uptown area, this is a no-brainer for a great lunch/dinner whatever.  My recommendations: White Trash Burger, Pickle Chips, Da Pimp, or if you are feeling extra southern - a double westside style (Chili, slaw, mustard, add cheese, boom goes the dynamite).  I'll be back time and time again.",

I don't believe they have the vegan options designated on the regular menu, but make sure to ask for the secret vegan menu. I had been to Pinky's several times before and then finally on one occasion my waiter realized I was ordering all vegan food so he brought this magical vegan menu from the kitchen that included tofu meals that aren't on the regular menu. The tofu concoction I had that day was delicious. Their chili is also amazing (and vegan) and has a good kick to it. This place gets packed right at noon so be prepared to wait in line. They have some good beers to choose from and I love their outdoor/indoor patio. Overall a solid place to hang out and grab a bite.",

My husband got the double \"white trash\" burger and it was HUGE! The pimento cheese waffle fries were not what we expected and AMAZING! My son loved the popcorn chicken.

During our weekend trip to Charlotte, we decided to try Pinky's after seeing all the pictures of the pimpin' cheese fries on yelp. It also didn't hurt that this restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. We arrived around 12PM on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. But the place was pretty full.  All the food we had was really good. I was dying to try the pimpin' fries and the crab puppies more than anything else. And since we knew those 2 appetizers were going to be a lot of food already, we opted to getting just one of the Pinky's dogs and sharing the 3 dishes between the 2 of us. We added the bacon to the pimpin' fries and these were sooooo delicious. You get your money's worth with the bacon and surprisingly, the waffle fries never got soggy despite the amount of cheese and bacon on them. The crab puppies were also amazing and came out really fresh. These will fill you up super fast though and we couldn't finish all of them. The Pinky Dog was good, but honestly I couldn't taste much of the pimento cheese since the chili overpowered it a bit. But it is still a really good dog!   As for the service, they were amazing! We had a handful of different people serving us. They all made sure our water was refilled before it even got halfway empty. And the food also came out really fast. It seems like this would be a good place to come have a few drinks and just nosh on some killer appetizers. They have a pretty cool bar and the decor gives it a great  vibe. I will definitely come back, because I want to try the corn dog battered shrimp that was featured on DDD!  Tip: Parking is behind/to the side of the restaurant. So don't freak out if you don't see an empty spot right in front.",

Of all the ones I've been to, this by far lives up to its reputation. The service was interesting because you aren't assigned one server, everyone helps which was confusing at first but ended up being great as it is round the clock service. The atmosphere is that of a diner and appears to be in an old garage/shop which is cool! The price was great, some things seemed a little pricey (like seafood) but I grew up at the beach, so I forget seafood costs more the further you are from where it comes from! The food was so so yummy! We started with the loaded fries which were waffle fries (genius, as they don't get soggy!) topped with pimento cheese and chili (drooling thinking of them). And I got the ding dong single patty burger which if you love PB and hot sauce (my favorite condiments) is a MUST TRY. And my man got \"guys pick\" of the triple G westside burger - which he stated \"Guy knows what he's talking about\".",

They come with a honey mustard sauce which I ended up putting on...well everything.  My friends swear by the crab hushpuppies but I don't care for crab myself so I sat that one out. I got to try a bite or two of the cornbread-battered shrimp. THOSE were GOOD! Again, dipped 'em in that honey mustard. I read that those are what brought Pinky's to TV fame.  Food aside, this place kicks ass inside. Sorry for the profanity kids, but I can think of no better descriptive word that really does it justice. Signs and stickers galore line the walls, doors, frames, appliances...basically anywhere with a surface. Seriously cool looks back into the history of Charlotte. And really, when you take in the location of Pinky's it's a wonder that it has lasted. It's sort of like a beacon in the middle of not-a-whole-lot. Sure there's some stuff that's sprung up around it. It's just hard to put in words but the place feels like it belongs and always has belonged. It's a moniker you only earn over time.  The staff here has been usually very helpful and friendly, especially for a perpetual noob like myself with a billion questions and a penchant for pointless conversation. They have banana pudding on the dessert menu. It's a great way to honor southern cooking and charm in one. And of course an even better way to round out a delicious, and affordable, meal.",

We sat at the bar and our server really went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. This is a bar I would frequent regularly if I lived in the area. We got the corn dog shrimp, the crab hush puppies, and the Asian burger. The tarter sauce that came with the seafood items was so good I wish they would bottle it for retail sale. Oh and don't forget to get the Banana pudding! So if you are in the area make sure to stop here! Lives up to the hype!",

I have bypassed this place for years and never thought not even once to step foot in.Yesterday myself and some friends wen't here for a quick bite to eat for lunch. The menu itself was very interesting catchy and funny style names of the burgers and meals,as well everything was super cheap. I was going to be extra and order the nature boy just because im a fan of the great Rick Flair. But instead i ordered the ding dong chicken which i was a little skeptical of ordering when i noticed a crunchy peanut butter spread present on the sandwich, but then i said to myself what the hay YOLO (you only live once) and decided i was going to take a chance if i die i die! To my surprise the burger was tasty and not at all what i was expecting and it was a nice touch with the honey cilantro slaw. My friends ordered the white trash burger, fried squash, and the highly recommended corn dog shrimp with waffle fries. Of coarse i had to taste test their food since this was  my first time and they both been before. Everything was definitely very consistent and up to par in my opinion. If you just want a cheat day and just want something out of control good with everything you can imagine,well Pinky's is the place to be.Oh how can i forget that banana pudding all i going to say is its sinful you don't want to visit and not get any point,blank,period.",

Order was partially taken by 3 different girls as they work in a \"team\" Now I'm waiting here for ANYBODY to bring the check now that we've been done for 15 minutes. Wings were not what we thought. Cooked the same way everyone else cooks them. Skin was not crispy at all. The corndog shrimp was pretty good. Nice big shrimp in a corndog crust but the batter wasn't too heavy. Burger was cooked medium well( no other option) I like mine medium rare but it was delicious with a nice grilled over charcoal taste.",

This is the most laid back you can possibly be without grabbing a pillow. The servers share the load, so you get fantastically attentive service since you won't get ignored by someone walking by just because they aren't invested in trying to get a good tip from you. The food is deceptively high quality. This is a book you can't judge by the cover. The menu items sound like typical bar food fare, but when you take your first bite you realize that what they're serving up is undeniably gourmet. Try the Asian Pork BBQ Tacos, and get some sweet potato fries while you're at it. The honey mustard they serve with the fries is stupid good.",

Food: I've been here 3 times now, the food is a solid 3, when cooked right. They're known for the pimento cheese fries, burgers and dogs.  I settled on the chicken philly, sub shrimp. Along with the infamous cheese fries.  It took 3 attempts to get hot food. The mgr got so mad he comp'd the bill, and apologized.   Service: This is the kinda place where everyone is your server.

It was really creepy driving there but got normal after looking at the bright neon lights and the crazy VW ladybird parked on top of the neon sign.  Don't be let down by the limited parking infront of the store. Those are just for the pickup customers. There is a huge parking behind the restaurant and you would find no problem finding a parking spot. And hey it's free parking!  The restaurant has a lot of hand made arts hanging all around. You can keep your eyes busy by looking at the various paintings, art work and light bulbs hanging around. The menu is quite something. It has lots of options. Beware that this is a single dollar budget restaurant- so make sure you order yourself sides and other dishes apart from your burger.  We got the popcorn chicken which was a wonderful start. They came in paper plates. For the main course ordered the soup of the day - crab bisque. And of course it came in a paper bowl. Got the white trash double patty burger. It was delicious! My friends got the ding dong chicken and the phily chicken. Both were not hugely satisfied in how their food looked or was presented.  I see it as a kind of restaurant you don't want to come in and dine at. It's a place for quick weekday lunch or dinner. The paper plates especially the paper soup bowl threw me off. Certainly the restaurant could do better in terms of utensils especially considering the huge crowd it gets.   I would recommend fellow yelpers to visit this restaurant! The restaurant has a cool vibe to it, the food tastes great and the food is cheap! You won't be disappointed if you choose to turn a blind eye at the paper utensils!",

When it comes to taste, Pinky's has never let me down. I love their bologna sandwich. The only thing is that I recommended you add cheese. Melted cheese on your bologna sandwich is nostalgia. We have also eaten their cheese fries, buffalo shrimp tacos, chicken bites, and white trash burger.  Everything is on point. Decadent, messy and delicious.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The come as you are quality of the staff, makes me feel comfortable pigging out. My wife says their veggie burger is the best one she has had.  If you find yourself looking for a casual dinner or lunch option, please do yourself a favor and visit Pinky's.",

I am mean it's off the hook!  The service was great, everybody is was warm and friendly, the atmosphere was awesome; but truly can we go back to the food. I had pimento cheese fries and the almost fried turkey sandwich and neither disappointed. I am drooling even now thinking about it, it's really a unique place in the Charlotte food scene.",

    "text": "Needless to say I was just disappointed in the food and experience.   I love the show Diners, Drive ins and Dives so when I knew we would be in the area I picked this restaurant out specifically because of the show and all the reviews about how great the place was. My husband and I went on a Friday at lunch time. We knew it would be busy so we weren't shocked by our wait. While we waited we were able to watch the episode of DDD where the restaurant aired.   When our names were finally called, we were seated at a very small dinky table in the middle of other small dinky tables. Our table itself was a two seater and the other two tables that were seated next to us (one on either side) were so close that we were unable to easily get to one of our seats. When I passed by the tables beside us to get to my seat my butt literally touched the chairs where people were seated. It almost seems the restaurant has grown too busy and they have tried to fix the problem by adding tables when they have no space for them. Also, the music is so loud in the restaurant that I couldn't hear my husband across the table and as previously mentioned my table is super small. This may be the experience that others are talking about but it wasn't an experience I enjoyed.  The food itself was nothing special. My husband ordered the mammoth and I ordered the corndog shrimp. The burger was greasy and I would have actually preferred a Five Guys burger. The shrimp themselves were okay. The corndog batter was sweet and the shrimp were fried nicely; however when I bit into my shrimp I could tell they weren't cleaned before fried (devained).   Unfortunately, I do not believe we will be back to this restaurant. It might have been a bad day for them, but it makes me upset as it seems so many people love this place. It might just not be for me!",

    "text": "I'm not sure how I have not reviewed Pinky's yet! This restaurant is like your quirky dive bar with yummy greasy food and great drink specials. Only downfall is that the service is a tad slow, but it's easy to get over when you're not in a rush.   As you walk up, you will see an antique car stationed on the roof, and the outdoor seating section. I am not typically one to choose outdoor seating, but at this restaurant - I don't mind.   The wait is usually long on the weekend so mentally prepare yourself. Longest I've ever waited was 50 min but that was on a Friday night when they were slammed - but it is worth the wait. Once seated, any server can help you even though you will have 1-2 main servers.   Now to the good stuff- everything at pinky's is good if you like hot, greasy food. The crab puppies, popcorn chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and the white trash burger are among my favorites.   Drinks- I get the $15 pitcher almost every time. It actually creates about 5-6 glasses so you can never go wrong. Impossible to find more bang for your buck.    Pinky's also sells apparel for those who are into that. That's never been my things but the designs are pretty cool!  Tip for parking: don't even bother turning into the restaurant just keep on going down Morehead and park in the lot behind the restaurant.",

I will say, if you come during lunch with a big group, you probably will have to split up if you want to get seated in a reasonable amount of time.   I wasn't quite as impressed with my food this time as what I've gotten in the past. I got the Reuben Dog which was good but very heavy on the sauerkraut and didn't have enough thousand island dressing. I also got the white trash burger which was incredibly dry. It was supposed to come with a ranch sauce but there was almost none on it. I had to add ketchup it was so dry.   I got my husband the Asian Burger to go and he loved it. I considered getting it myself, so I'm definitely disappointed that I went with something else.   Still a great local diner that's worth checking out, I just think the food was a little off for my order today.",

I came to Pinky's this past Sunday with 5 others around 7 pm and we waited for about 35 mins. After we were called, we were seated outside which was amazing because the weather was beautiful.   Their vegetarian menu items are super super limited which kinda sucks, but they are happy to substitute any items in/out. The first time I came to Pinky's, I ordered their veggie hot dog which I did not like (not a fan of veggie dogs). So, I learned from my mistake, and ordered the Chicken Tacos WITHOUT the chicken. The tacos came with black beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, and sauce. There could have been more toppings like onions, cheese, sour cream, etc. I asked for spicy ranch on the side as well as waffle fries. The spicy ranch is soooo tasty. Definitely recommend for 'bar-like' food!  @Pinky's - Please add at least one vegetarian item to all of your food categories, it would be VERY appreciated.",

Since the 3rd person in my party hadn't arrived, my other guest and I were told that we could not have a seat at a table and start to order, that they only seat people when the entire party is there.  My guest and I sat at the bar and ordered drinks until my other guest arrived. The bartender was friendly and got us drinks promptly. We were finally seated at a table and then ordered appetizers and more drinks. Our waiters were very nice and upbeat. They were even helpful when we asked for their suggestions on menu items.  We ordered the Crabby hush puppies, Pimpin Fries with bacon, and fried pickles for appetizers. My favorite were the Pimpin Fries which had homemade pimento cheese on top and a load of delicious bacon. My next favorite were the fried pickles with Ranch, and my least favorite were the Crabby Hush puppies. After we finished the appetizers, we ordered entrees.  One of my guest ordered the Corndog Shrimp, which came with coleslaw, and waffle fries. She loved it! I tasted the shrimp and coleslaw and agreed that it was delicious. For my entree, I ordered 3 buffalo shrimp tacos which came with a side of very flavorful black beans. This was delicious as well and I didn't share.  The women's bathroom was very clean and smelled very fresh compared to other restaurant bathrooms I've been in. As the night progressed, Pinky's got really crowded.   Overall, Pinky's was a great choice and was featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on The Food Network. I can say, it lived up to the mark, and Guy Fieri's picture and signature on the wall, sealed the deal.  I'd visit again and make sure to have the Pimpin Fries add bacon, Tacate beer, and Shrimp Tacos. The burgers looked amazing coming out of the kitchen, so I'll definitely grab a loaded burger next time too.",

Even when there is a wait, I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes.   The VEGETARIAN CHILI is a bit sweet for my taste, so I'm not a huge fan of eating a bowl of it, but it's great on a hot dog, burger or fries.    Speaking of hot dogs and burgers, they have vegetarian versions of both, so you don't have to miss out on any of the fun burger combos or corn dogs.  Vegetarian corn dogs!  The breading on the CORN DOG is sweet and corn bread-ish, but lighter and fried.     I had the VEGGIE DOG with CHILI and PIMENTO CHEESE.  Everything about it worked for me.  The dog itself probably isn't that great, but smothered in chili and cheese, it's delicious.    The FRIED PICKLES have a basic flour breading (which I prefer over cornmeal, but not as good as tempura batter).  They were crispy and served with a thick creamy ranch dipping sauce.    My sister enjoyed the SWEET POTATO FRIES.  I'm never a fan, so I'm not a good judge, but I found them to be sweet and limp, not at all what I want from a fry.    The DING DONG STYLE BURGER is weird but everyone at my table enjoyed it (to varying degrees).  The peanut butter flavor was a bit too strong, so we countered with loads of sriracha.  But the honey slaw on top was a nice touch.    NOT QUITE FRIED TURKEY SANDWICH is not at all fried, for those who are wondering.  It's a baked turkey that has been sliced and layered on a bun with bacon, fresh basil, tomato, mayo and cheese.  Husband found it to be an acceptable healthier alternative to what the rest of us ordered (minus the cheese and mayo).    The baked PIMENTO CHEESE WAFFLE FRIES with BACON = the piece de resistance for us.  They are careful to layer the pimento cheese inside the fries so it's not just on top.  The bacon is perfectly crispy, and while this might have been the most decadent dish, it's definitely the most delicious.  Add sriracha for more amazing-ness.    I did not get the bill, so I have no idea how much the BANANA PUDDING cost, but it was too much for 4 of us to split (so whatever the cost, probably worth it).  It's messy looking, slopped into a bowl with a couple of spoons stuck into the top, and it's nothing gourmet or interesting.  But it nicely satisfied all of our sweet cravings at the end of a gluttonous meal.    Only come here if you don't care about fat or calories.  It's a cheat meal, for sure.",

No complaints from me though.  I was surprised by the number of vegetarian options they had on the menu, not only do they have a veggie burger but also veggie hotdogs and corndogs! I had the corndog and was super happy with it. My husband had the veggie dog with vegetarian chili and was over the moon. We started off with the fried pickles for the table as well and they are chips which I always enjoy. All in all I can't wait for my next visit, I feel that they will be satisfying a lot of my cravings here!",

The restaurant is in an oddball location with some goofy parking options but when you get inside you're seated fairly fast and the food comes in fast as well since they don't use fancy plates or cups.   Always some drink specials, cheap beer options available. And the food comes in ballpark style paper containers. The pimento cheese fries, the nature boy white trash style and the shrimp tacos as my favorite!   Go check it out you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "The first time we came to Pinkies was almost an accident. We had planed to be at Food Truck Friday but were rained out.   So, group of 16 people, Friday night, and no reservations anywhere. Crap!  Somehow we ended up at Pinkies. If you've ever passed this place then you know it's impossible to miss. The giant VW Beetle painted with Stars and Stripes on the roof is hard to ignore.   We shuffled in and luckily we are all friends because the waiting area it kitchy and fun, but also small! Thankfully none of us had B.O. and impressively we were all seated in less that 15 minutes!  Now the menu! Pinkies is like no place I've been before. There are some \"normal\" choices but most of the menu is a hodge podge of odd combinations most with interesting names.   Things like Wasabi Ranch Dressing are available and leave you in a strange place of excitement to try something unusual and fear of having no idea what anything will taste like because its all so different!  I can't remember what I got but I ordered the strangest thing I could find on the menu and it was amazing!   I've been back three times and ordered different items and found them all somewhere on the scale of decent-to-great. Nothing has bombed yet!  The food is interesting and they do a great job of combining odd things and making them work. The prices are fantastic, especially for the adventurous menu, which is further encouragement to try new things!  Service is hit or miss like many places. It really depends on the night and the server but if you come with a group of friends and share a beer or two, you'll probably not even notice.   Overall, Pinkies is a great place for \"Foodies\" and budget minded people alike.",

From the time of walking in the door we were encouraged not to sit outside because it would be too much for the the staff to have to come out there(the weather was in the high 60s low 70s). Our serving staff consisted of a gentleman and a young lady by the name of Sara. Sara was awesome she checked on my friend and I several times to ensure our satisfaction, but the gentleman appeared to be annoyed. We asked questions about items on the menu and is response was \"I dont know,\" and \"It depends on what you like.\" He was very dry. He did not ask how the food was and never refilled our drinks. With that being said a group of gentlemen walked in and the same server went over specials with them, and gave them his preferences. He even brought them a picture to refill their drinks before they finished their food. Over all our experience would have been a total bust if not for Sara. Have a blessed day!",

    "text": "Three words: Ding Dong Burger. One of the best things about Pinky's is the opportunity to order a 5 oz burger a la carte for under $5. The Ding Dong Burger is by far the best of the lot: slathered with peanut butter, honey cilantro slaw, and Sriracha, it is a wonderful expression of Asian-inspired flavor.   You may ask yourself, \"That title, though... am I eating a racist burger?\" The answer, as it turns out, is no: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thai-language.com%2Fforums%2Ft%2Ftranslation%2Fbasic%2Ft7168&s=d3a3b53cabae91d8b90d1862d371ee93c12df35d54b4d79510bc2f6652dc8cd2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thai-language.com/forums...</a>  Anyway, Pinky's is a gem of a place. Divey, cheap, fun, and delicious. The beer and drink specials will treat your wallet with kid gloves while the food, most of it heavily fried, will make your waistline expand. But, the flavors are worth it, goddammit. They have these awesome crab hush puppies of which you can't just eat one. They serve delicious local dishes, like fried squash and fried pickles. They have some awesome all-beef hot dogs. They feature a variety of local beers for next to no money.   AND! They're open till 11 pm on a Sunday! Perfect for late eaters like me.",

The falafel ain't too shabby either.   Might as well come on a Tuesday night because all of their drafts are $2.50 and I believe they were all local Charlotte drafts to boot. Had a Lennyboy Burn Down Brown and Birdsong Higher Ground for $2.50 each. A steal. On Friday night, they do craft beer roulette. For $3, they bring you whatever craft bottle they want which is kind of fun.   With Wesley Heights being my future hood, Pinky's will likely be seeing me much more frequently.",

    "text": "Best rated burger joint with price and quality hands-down. It may not look like a whole lot from the outside, but you should be able to tell my the locals mixed with visitors it's a hot-spot.  - Friendly servers and atmosphere - Quality food - Can be a bit messy, careful! - Reasonably priced - Parking can be tricky - Check the photos!  You can easily get lunch for two under $20 with drinks and starter.  I finished up a Spartan Race and headed over to Pinky's to recoup. I needed a massive amount of protein and some potassium for my aching body.  I ordered up some some fried pickles because they usually hit the spot when your starving and don't take long to get to your table. Greg's pickles ($3.95 small) were tasty but not my favorite part of the meal, just too greasy.  I love the whole concept of ordering burgers here, basically you pick 1-3 5oz patties and choose from three styles and can add any additions. EVERYTHING includes mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickles. I ordered the WESTSIDE which comes with mustard, chili, slaw & onion. You can also pick DING DONG STYLE with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. Whatever floats your boat!  The Mammoth westside style ($5.75) was such a beast. It wasn't very wide but was quite the skyscraper. Can you say jaw fatigue? It really hit the spot.   My wife picked up the Green Chile Pork ($6.25) and we both loved it. You can't go wrong with marinated pork grilled with pineapple slices, melted swiss cheese, arugula and jamaican mayonnaise on a seeded bun. The sauce had so much flavor and pineapple added such a boost.  I loved this place, although I could have went without the pickles. This will be a place I stop at often when in the area!",

My fiance loves this place so when we began dating it became a regular for us. A good selection of burgers with different taste from simple to pimento cheese and fried pickles to peanut butter (it's good trust me!). Get the fried pickles if that's your thing...really good. Word of advice though they will not seat you until your whole party is there. That's never really an issue as I think the longest I've waited on a Friday Saturday or Sunday night was 15-20 minutes but if you have a large party it's just something to consider. Really love this place and consider it a must visit for friends and family when they come to Charlotte!",

(He's sweet like that.) I looked through the menu online and had a tough time narrowing it down because so many things looked good or fairly interesting and unique. I ended up requesting the Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich because I remember it being featured on the DD&D episode. Something about the turkey breast being enclosed in some wrapping and then deep-fried in oil... like poached, but in grease at a high heat. Needless to say, I was intrigued.  I must say this sandwich did not disappoint! And I ate it after it had been brought home to sit in our fridge for several hours, keep in mind. It held up beautifully! Sturdy, tasty bun. The turkey really was wonderfully moist and flavorful. Slathered with some kind of garlic sauce with hearty basil leaves topped on. And provolone with a nice bite, toasted to perfection. I am so impressed with this sandwich that I seriously cannot wait to visit Pinky's in person and try something fresh outta the kitchen!",

I checked out a tip from a fellow Yelper the other day and decided to swing by for lunch pick up since options are pretty scarce around my office...   I was able to place a to-go order over the phone fairly easily without a long hold time at all... Upon arriving, I had to park across the street which I kind of expected... If you haven't been, the parking lot is probably about 10 spaces, if that... Across the street, there are marked spaces in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot... Make sure to use those... I don't know if they tow, but who wants to find out?  I arrived about 10 minutes after placing my order and my food was all ready to go... Definite plus... When you're working with limited time, not having to stand around waiting for food you called in is absolutely awesome... As usual, the servers were quick and very friendly...   I ordered the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich as tacos and it was amazing... I don't typically like crunchy peanut butter, but I barely even noticed those peanuts...  Between the honey-cilantro slaw and the yum yum sriracha, it had a great Thai-like flavor... I decided to be healthy and ordered the fried squash as well... The breading was light and crispy... A great crunch without completely taking over the flavor or overpowering the veggie...   One of the most important parts for a to-go order is food temperature and Pinky's really held up in that aspect... By the time I got back to my office, the food was still piping hot and delish...  I finally have another lunch place! Yes!",

    "text": "Came here with the fiance for the first time in many years.  Our waitress came by and took our shortly after we were seated.  While taking our order, I began to request that we get fried pickles instead of onion rings as one of our side.  Before I could finish explaining I wanted a substitution the waitress just walked off.  Shortly after, my fiance finished her drink.  We waited for our waitress, but did not see her at all inside the restaurant for close to ten minutes, another waitress (of the table next to us) noticed her empty cup and filled it up.  Later, another waitress dropped off our food, and as I expected, we received two sides of onion rings and fried pickles rather than just one order of onion rings and fried pickles since our waitress didn't let me finish placing my order.  My burger did not have any cheese on it, so I decided to wait and ask our waitress for a slice of cheese from the kitchen. She never came by, I had to wave down another waitress, who ended up being nice and helpful.  The fried pickles were indeed still good, however, both my fiance and I agreed that the burgers were not good.  They had the texture and look of burgers that had been kept in a steam warmer or container of beef brother, there was not any searing from griddle or chargrilling. It was not what I remembered of Pinky's years ago (or the Penguin for that matter).  Neither of us could finish our burgers due to the odd texture or lack of apparent grilling / cooking so we decided to get the bill.  Again we could not find our waitress, so I asked the other waitress that helped us out earlier for the bill. Then for the first time since we were seated, our waitress came by and snagged the bill with my credit card.  Overall, the service was bad and the burgers were no good, don't see us coming back again.",

I tried this place because it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives from the Food Network and I was not disappointed.  This is a great local diner. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there's no convenient parking, it can get too crowded and loud, and I feel like while they have some great craft beer, there could be more variety to it, especially better supporting the local breweries. With that said, I'll be eating here over and over again.",

I haven't had a bad meal and I don't think I could pick out my favorite, so I'll tell you a couple of yummy things you should try. Appetizers: The homemade veggie chili is really good (I could use a bowl right now, it's so cold outside). Pimp'N fries, no you read that right, fresh waffle fries topped with melted pimento cheesey goodness. Greg's pickles, deep fried pickles with ranch. The portions are huge. AND my favorite, the crab puppies, they look just like a hush puppy but have crab inside, they're served with tarter sauce. I'm not a huge fan of tarter sauce but I'm a fan of this awesome combination! Burgers: my husband loves the white trash burger (burger with provolone,fried pickles, and onion rings and spicy ranch sauce) If I order a burger, I usually just get the Pterodactyl with cheese and pick my own toppings! I've tried the ding dong chicken sandwich once, the crunchy peanut butter, sriracha hot sauce and honey cilantro sounds like a weird combo and it was but it was also a weird/delicious combination. When I want to feel healthy, I get the Falafel with hummus or the grilled Pita. Even the Uptown Tuna Melt is really good. They literally have anything for everyone! As for drinks, they have a great selection of beer and my two favorite cocktails are the Unicorn tears and the Poinsetta which is like a mimosa except with cranberry juice! Okay, I've literally written a book but this restaurant has been my go-to since moving to Charlotte!!",

Tried the wings too and they were delicious. Boyfriend said they were one of the best he's ever had. Ranch dressing is so good with it. My favorite item on the menu is their chili dog with pimento cheese and I add onions to it. The chili is sooo good but the pimento cheese on it really gives the flavor a kick.

    "text": "I'm sorry to be the Debbie Downer here, but Pinky's was just very overwhelming in atmosphere and underwhelming in food. It was not only recommended by Yelpers but a good friend who is a Charlotte native.   Starting with the parking lot, the experience was frustrating at times. The lot is TINY and cramped and if you aren't a local and don't know all the good side streets, you can feel a little lost trying to park. The bright spot was walking in: there's a super fun photo booth that is a cheap and interesting way to pass some time while waiting for food. The eclectic beer list should please pretty much anyone. The service was a little lacking for me. I understand I came with a pretty straight-laced party with kids, but the young hipster that served us seemed pretty unnecessarily annoyed by having to serve us. He wasn't rude or slow, just seemed to have a permanent scowl and seemed \"above it all\". I started looking around for signs that the restaurant's \"schtick\" was overly-bored staff. It was also SUPER loud...not a great atmosphere for a family meal or book club, or even people that want to hear themselves talk. Great for a party of loud rambunctious people, though.  The food was really the disappointing part to me. After seeing the DDD episode I was excited for innovative food and tried the veggie burger. Um...there was SO MUCH GREASE that my bun was pretty much useless. Between the fried appetizer and \"veggie\" burger, I used so many napkins that I was probably the reason our server was annoyed. My parents seemed pretty lackluster about their burgers, too. I expect that from my dad, who hates restaurants, but my mom is usually pretty easy going and she didn't have much to say about her food. Or if she did, I couldn't hear it. My hubs liked whatever he got, I'm pretty sure it was a sandwich with a rare tuna steak. So there's a food bright spot.  All in all, we don't visit Charlotte very often but there will definitely be other places I want to try rather than returning to Pinky's.",

Owned by one of the former owners of The Penguin during that restaurant's renaissance, what was supposed to become The Penguin 2 ended up changing it's name to Pinky's but still featuring the same great burgers, chili, sandwiches and other great items. Little portions on big plates does not happen here. Here, you get more than you can eat at a very fair price, whether it's burgers, sandwiches or anything else they serve. For your health's sake, you may want to make it a treat instead of a staple, but it's still some of the best food in Charlotte and possibly some of the best burgers in the area!",

Very diverse menu from salads, to dogs, to tacos, and burgers. You can be as healthy or unhealthy as you want and trust it will be a good meal. Decent prices, but they are one of those places that charge you for everything...Fries? That'll be extra. Toppings? That'll be extra. You get the point.  Parking is kind of a pain, but there are lots across the street and adjacent. This place gets busy during peak hours so expect a wait. They also have great food and drink specials daily.  Ding dong sandwich is sort of a \"pad thai\" take on a chicken sandwich, different and pretty good...I'd recommend it if that;s your kind of thing. The turkey burgers are impressive for this type of joint. Fish tacos, fresh and delicious.  The downside... service is a little odd. It's an \"everyone is your server\" type of place which makes it confusing and a bit awkward.",

Always go for the white trash burger, add sour kraut and it's perfectly delicious! The chili cheese waffle fries, fried pickles, crab puppies and veggie burgers are a must try too! My fav time to visit is on Friday's for craft beer roulette. Bring a few friends so you guys can swap out beers if you get one you don't like ;)",

Orders were veggie burger white trash style (bun doesn't hold up, but that never surprises me), Fish fry, Crab cakes, falafel salad, cheerwine pound cake, banana pudding. few others, but all things ordered got rave reviews. The tahini dressing for the falafel salad was amazing, though the falafel themselves were a little over done. The tartar sauce was incredibly well spiced (reports, I'm allergic to shell fish so after the crab cakes I was out). The banana pudding was the best I've ever tasted. The honey version of cole slaw was incredible and I could not stop stealing someones red potato salad. So much garlic that I didn't know red potato salad needed. I so wanted to get the veggie hot dogs with stuff all over them.",

Somehow the crabpuppies were either prepared incorrectly or cross contaminated, and resulted in an immediate stomachache followed by stomach pain all night, and this went for everyone in our party who had them (those who didn't were fine afterwards).  Service was not the best, and one server we had was very impatient and uncomfortable, making our experience the same.   Overall, food was cheap but not great for the very cheap price, the Matty patty melt was very dry and after a few bites I couldn't force myself to finish it. Absolutely one of the WORST dining experiences I've had in Charlotte, and I hope this was just a bad experience and not a typical one.",

Great atmosphere, burgers, fried food and a surprising (in a good way) amount of vegetarian options (veggie hot dog w/veggie chili is good even to meat lovers).  Everything is served al la carte and the prices encourage you to order a lot!  I def recommend the crab puppies (hushpuppies with crab) and the shrimp dog basket (jumbo shrimp fried like a corn dog).  If you are looking to go on the lighter side- the Ginger Tuna Salad has a fun Asian twist.  Added bonus- the drinks are dirt cheap.  Easy to see how this became a Charlotte staple!",

At 3pm on a Saturday afternoon there was a wait but we were lucky and found two great spots at the bar.  I ordered the strawberry basil lemonade made with gin and my husband got a beer. My drink 5/5 perfect for the hot humid day.  We preceded with the burger featured on diners drive ins and dives...forget the name but Asian pork burger with Asian sweet sauce and cole slaw. I gave it a 4/5 but my husband gave it 3/5. It had a unique flavor and definitely wasn't traditional. Fried pickles 5/5 yummy!!!!!! Pimp'n fries with added bacon 4/5 I wish they had more cheese. As stated before service was great! We actually saw the owner present recognized him from the TV show diners drive ins and dives. All staff seem to actually enjoy their jobs which in my opinion sets the tone for the dining experience.  Wish we had something like this in Las Vegas!  Recommend this place to others for sure!",

We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken. Saw fried pickles on the menu and quickly put in an order for those bad boys. Served with homemade ranch dressing, they were very tasty. The 4 year old got the pterodactyl burger. He thought it was made of actual Dino meat and scarfed it down. Score! 2 year old got a corn dog and ate almost half which in toddler land is a win. The hubs and I both got the pinky dog. It's a hot dog smothered in homemade pimento cheese and chili. It was pretty darn tasty. For sides we had the waffle fries (standard) and the southern slaw (meh). Being 7 months preggo I did not have a chance to enjoy a cocktail though I did read longingly through the menu which featured many delish sounding drinks with fun names. Unicorn tears anyone?!?  All in all a good place with a fun and funky atmosphere.  The prices aren't too bad either.",

I could not have enjoyed it more.    I ordered the waffle fries, they came to the table cold and dry. I had to send them back. They still were a not so great when I got a new order.  I should have tried the cheese fries. They looked really good. The onion rings were delicious. Greasy goodness.   The waitresses were very friendly and helpful with menu selections honestly. There are so many drink specials it was hard for me to choose. The parking situation is clumsy.  Very little parking by the grill. There is parking around the corner with ominous warnings to take all of your belongings and no guarantee of safety at all. Park at your own risk.   I had patio dining on a wonderful day. A breeze came along and knocked the umbrella on my head. I was stunned and a bit dazed. This was an easily preventable accident.   The base of the umbrella was not weighted. The umbrella had a flimsy zip cord keeping it attached to the railing. It was not safe. It was mere inches from my eyes l was lucky my head took most of the brunt and less of my face. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and headache that night. I was sorry to see managment was not extremely concerned by this error.  My bill was deducted by a few dollars. The price of my mediocre tasting waffle fries. In an accident of this nature it would have been better to not bill my party at all. A more litigious patron would have called their lawyer from the table. I would have loved to give more stars, however getting hit in the head  while eating dry waffle fries was a serious offense that was taken much too lightly by management.",

I was hungry, in a hurry, and had places to be.  My bad!   There were probably four other choices I could have made to let this be a strong 4 star rating.  I had to pick, at my waiters assurance, the Fish Tacos (three $10.25).  The Gorton's Fisherman has served me better \"beer battered tilapia\"!    The menu described it as having honey-cilantro slaw, spicy ranch, and served with a side of black beans.  Apparently they were out of honey, cilantro, and spicy ranch.  At least none of those flavors found their way to my plate.  Had I gone to a supermarket, found the cheapest can of black beans, and heated them up in a microwave adding nothing else for flavoring, they would have been better tasting than the black beans that were part of my meal.  I really wanted to love this place!  Maybe another time I will....",

Aside from that, everything else is amazing. The staff takes care of everyone - it's definitely a team effort and it works well. The crab puppies are delicious and so are the burgers and the buffalo chicken. On Saturdays, the liquor is 1/2 off and the wedding punch and white gummy bear drinks are dangerously good. Oh and they have a cement triceratops out front.",

They're busy pretty much every visit so I don't complain about small stuff but if I'm standing their that long then I already know my food is gonna take forever so I leave. The other drawback is some of the names had my friends looking at me differently as if I was trying to be prejudice or something lmaooo no biggie tho",

If you need to cure a hangover or are out late at night and need quick bite, Pinky's is a must try. We ordered the pimpin' fries as one of the appetizers, and it was awesome. Don't think twice and order these perfectly seasoned, crispy waffle fries covered in melty pimento cheese and huge, crunchy pieces of bacon. The waffle fries were crispy down to the last bite even though they were covered in cheese and bacon. We also had the crab hush puppies, and it comes with thirteen big hush puppy balls with good lumps of crab meat cooked throughout. They were very filling and were delicious with the tarter sauce to dip.  For my entree, I ordered the Pinky Dog, which was a hot dog with pimento cheese and chili. The hot dog was a decent size and along with two appetizers, was plenty of food for me. The chili was meaty and hot, really giving the hot dog some great flavor. The pimento cheese wasn't as prominent in flavor because of the chili, but you did get some melty gooieness underneath from it. Overall, I had a great lunch at Pinky's and really enjoyed there awesome food all for a very reasonable price.",

Got back to CLT on time to meet my wife at baggage claim and we thoroughly enjoyed the simple goodness of onion strings and fried pickles on a cheese burger plus more onion strings...

After seeing this location on diners dive-ins and dives I had to check it out only because it was owned by the former penguin restaurant owner, and that place was great (they still have that famous pamemto cheese). One thing I love is that they have a variety of menu items food and drink. When I sat down there were multiple pages of drinks. The food menu is impressive too it's robust take your time. So for my drink I had the strawberry basil lemonade. It's fresh, but basil makes drinks taste that way. For the food I had the \"Nature Boy\" veggie burger. It's base is a black bean burger with a lot of veggie ingredients. It's  huge the sandwich is very filling in itself, if you can finish. The onion rings are thin rings which makes for a lot when you get small. Fried pickles are good, a little greasy but that's the point. Its not a game here they have absolutely great  food and  drinks.  To really enjoy this place you need to come here twice. One down for me.",

Your subjected to parking behind the building then walking up. Trust me you'll need the exercise after eating here. The inside is relatively small, we had a party of 8, decided to split up into 2 groups.   I wouldn't advise coming here during the busy lunch traffic. The wait time is between 15-25mins which is expected.   After being seated, we quickly ordered. I had the White Trash Burger and the Crab Hushpuppies. The White Trash burger lacked flavor. I added sriracha thinking this would help.... Nope! Felt like I was eating Wonder Bread with sriracha....But hell I was hungry so I ate it. Now the Crab Hushpuppies were AMAZING! I saw heaven with every bite! I spent about $12 on my meal.  Not bad!  Yes, I'm willing to try this place again. The grill grilled cheese is next on my list! Until next time ...",

The staff has tattoos and piercing which just gives to the ambiance of the restaurant; cool and laid back!  Everyone here is very accommodating, with great customer service!   You could literally order the whole menu because everything is so cheap! But trust me you will get lots of food so don't do it! I love their tacos, burgers and the appetizers. You can pick anything and will not get disappointed!!   This place is a cool place to go to at night as well. It's pretty busy on the weekends so get there early so you can get a good seat at the bar or so you won't have to wait long for a table!",

I am a newbie vegan and I ordered a vegan burger with vegan mayo. Also they offer salads, appetizers and a falafel wrap. My burger was very good except they put too much mayo. + Customer service- Although it was extremely busy all the staff were very friendly and made sure to check on us, refill cups, and quickly remove finished dishes +Location- I am so glad Pinky's is on the Westside of Charlotte.   -Wait Time- we probably waited over 25 mins for a table for four. The waiting area is small. -Dining area- It is very tight in the dining area which also includes a bar. You get to know your neighbor.",

I think next time I would prefer in on a corn dog but it surprisingly works on the shrimp too.  Fried pickles were good.  The house chips were a bit over cooked for my taste.  I appreciate that when you ask for a side of ranch, you get a SIDE of ranch, not a tiny 1/2 oz mini shot.  The Margaritas were good and the $15 special pitcher was well worth the price.  Overall, a good time.  Parking was minimal, but a dirt lot (caution very muddy) was only a couple block away.",

They have a number of vegetarian options. My fella is vegetarian and he really enjoys the Nature Boy veggie burger served white trash style, and meat eater that I am, I have to say I am tempted to try it someday, it looks really good.

Just to give you a little taste - menu items include everything from sriracha to crunchy peanut butter to wieners... what more could you ask for?!  We went for lunch today and the service was quick and helpful.  Prices are reasonable and the selection is large.  There are some healthy options, but why waste your time when you know you want to dive into some fried pickles or sweet potato fries.  I will say there were a lot of vegan/vegetarian options - which was a nice surprise.  Overall I give this place 5 stars because it's not trying to be anything other than what it is.  Plus they have triceratops toys placed inconspicuously all over the entire restaurant.  Bonus points!",

And they're just as good cold as they are hot- maybe better. That is one delicious ball of yum.   Let's back up and say that I've been here before, but it's been awhile. I can't get the White Trash Burger out of my head though. That, plus the beer list and the atmosphere and you've got a winner. I still haven't tried the corn dogs but they're on my to-do list.  I know others have mentioned the parking, but it really is a big sore spot to this otherwise excellent restaurant. I had to turn around twice to be able to even get into the lot across the street (with the tattoo parlor) and then almost hit a Pinky's-bound pedestrian while I was turning in.

    "text": "Normally Yelp leads me to places I really like while I'm traveling for work, but unfortunately, I wasn't all that impressed by Pinky's.   The ambiance was neat - this diner-ish place is housed in a converted gas station. Loved the music that was playing and the smorgasbord of options on the menu. But my food was just meh.   Started out with veggie chili. It was ok, but nothing special. Split the falafel balls and the friend pickles with a coworker. The falafel balls seemed pretty flavorless to me and in contrast, the fried pickles were way too salty. (and this is coming from a girl who drinks pickle juice, so that tells you how salty they were)   I had a very unmemorable veggie sandwich on pita bread. I may be spoiled because where I live, fresh pita is served just about everywhere, but their pita tasted like the wonder bread of pita.   My coworker had the fish tacos. We'd been to a place the night before with really amazing tacos (hello, Krazy Fish) so he wasn't all that impressed wither.   I was also a little put off by all of the plastic/styrofoam dinnerware. I understand that they're going for the divey kind of atmosphere, but...I thought I was going to puncture my plate at one point.   Overall, this was a sub par experience. I think this would be the kind of place I'd like to drink at...but I don't think I'd ever go back for food. But at least the drive to Pinky's allowed me to see a lot of the city!",

    "text": "Today we visited Pinky's for lunch as we occasionally  do on the Sunday's that my husband works. It is one of the few areas on the Westside for us to enjoy a family meal while he is working. We arrived a little after Pinky's opened.  When we were greeted, we told the hostess that we had four in our group. She asked if everyone was here. I told her that my husband was on his way and would be arriving shortly. She said we would have to wait. I try to never use his job as an excuse or reason for anything. But as the place was filling up as it always does because it is a great restaurant; I let her know he was a police officer and was on a call and had limited time to eat. She again stated she couldn't seat us. I then said well then there are three of us and we were seated. We ordered our food and ordered for him so his food would be ready when he arrived. While waiting, our 10 year old noticed that there were several large tables being sat that only two or three in the party were preset.  I approached the hostess and asked her why this was. She got defensive and pointed to a sign stating the rule is the party isn't seated until everyone is preset. I asked why the large parties were different. She stated they were there when the restaurant opened. I let her know we were as well. When I asked her why she was dismissive to law enforcement, she ignored me and asked did I want to speak to a manager. I declined and let her know we would let the law enforcement and emergency services community be aware of this.  I know rules are rules and I want to follow those but how is this restaurant being consistent about their own policy. I would never have said anything.had they not broken their own policy. If you are going to have a rule, be consistent.",

The service here was quick and friendly, we always had staff check up on our table with little disturbance to us. The music selection here is excellent, plus you can pick music from the jukebox up front! So onto the food, we shared three appetizers:  Greg's Pickles (Fried dill pickle chips) - served with ranch dip, nothing spectacular but it was pretty good.  Pimp'n Fries - melted cheese over waffle fries, if you get this ADD THE BACON, but again it wasn't spectacular or one of the best fries I've had.  CRAB PUPPIES - NOW THIS WAS AMAZING, basically these are hushpuppies with crabmeat served with a dipping sauce (I could not remember what the dipping sauce was but it was awesome). They were crispy, sweet, and deeeelicious! I'd go back to Pinky's just for these!  Then, I had their Pterodactyl burger with everything on it and cheese added. It wasn't anything special, just felt like another burger to me, plus the meat was a little on the dry side which was a little bit offputting to me, but it was a decent burger.  I want to give Pinky's 4 stars for the atmosphere and great service, but the food wasn't super amazing to me, I'd be willing to go back to Pinky's to try other items on the menu though. I'd give Pinky's 3.5 stars if I could.",

Rumor has it that this place is run by the people that ran The Penguin (a Charlotte institution) for decades.  They've split with ownership and opened Pinky's.  It has the same vibe and great food at inexpensive prices.  I haven't confirmed all of this, but it's generally accepted as fact in Charlotte...maybe its just an urban legend.  I had the Ding Dong chicken sandwich, which is slaw, sirachi, and crunchy peanut butter. I was suspicious of this combo at first, but am now a believer.  I didn't expect it (maybe I'm just slow), but the combination tasted Thai inspired, almost like pad thai.  I also had the sweet potato fries, also good.

We ordered the sweet potato chips with wasabi dip, pimpin' cheese fries with chili and fried pickles. Light and delicious breading on the pickles was so nicely seasoned and the crispy of the sweet potato chips was not greasy at all. Sweet tea was delicious.  Then on to our dinner. We ordered pterodactyl burgers, one DING DONG STYLE and the other WESTSIDE STYLE. cooked to perfection made of ultra fresh beef. Toppings were amazing and in the right proportions to the huge burgers. My other dinner companion ordered the pork burger with arugula and pineapples. It had the most amazing flavor explosion on my tongue when I begged a bite.  We were too full for dessert but took home a piece of pound cake lemon drop style. (Yes like the soda.) They also have cheerwine flavored cake. Just like homemade.  As you can see I really don't like this place!  Totally kidding. I adore it and I'll be back.  As for the staff, they work together like a clock. Everyone there is wiling to fill your glass or answer you needs from the hostess to the cook. That's what makes this place the total package.",

    "text": "I have been longing for the Penguin's fried pickles since they closed.  I tried The Burger Co, no dice, weird breading.  So when we stopped into Pinky's for lunch I HAD to try the pickles.    Don't tell anyone, but I think their fried pickles are better than Penguin's!  The ranch has some oomph to it that Penguin lacked.    I got the Matty Patty Melt.  it was fantastic.  The burgers are on the small side, but you can double any burger.  I can't wait to come back and try the corn dogs, especially the veggie corn dog and check out the beer list (drinking at noon on a Monday, kind of frowned upon)  I love how varied the menu is, there is literally something for everyone.  You can't beat being able to satisfy even the most die hard greasy burger fan and a picky vegetarian at the same time.    my only complaint was with the waffle fries, they were pretty boring, but i'm sure smothered in pimento they'd be better.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places in Charlotte, for both the food and the decor. I've been here several times, and almost everything off of the menu I've tried has been fantastic. The appetizers are my favorite part! The pimp'n fries are perfectly cooked waffle fries topped with gobs of melty pimento cheese - amazing. The crab puppies are perfectly fried hushpuppies with just the right hint of crab. You also can't go wrong with the sweet potato chips and wasabi ranch dressing dipping sauce. After appetizers like this, it takes True dedication to power through to the entree portion of the meal! My favorite is the corn dog shrimp - jumbo shrimp deep fried in wads of delicious corn dog batter?! Genius. I've also enjoyed the salads before, which are fresh and flavorful. All of the food comes in paper baskets, which can make ordering a salad interesting, but no big deal. My boyfriend loves the burgers, although he prefers \"everything\" style rather than \"westside\" style (the chili/slaw topped option). I've also enjoyed the grilled Greek pita sandwich. And while I felt I had to try the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich (chicken breast topped with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha, and slaw), I felt it was worth trying once but not my thing. I have yet to try one of their hot dogs (and they offer veggie dogs too!). Their cocktail menu is also pretty extensive and appealing. I took my dad here and he loved the colorful Andy Warhol-ish paintings of celebs on the wall, as well as all of the Frankenstein memorabilia - we're big fans of classic horror movies. The prices here are also fantastic! You can walk away completely satisfied (albeit full of fried goodness and alcohol) for pretty darn cheap. A Charlotte gem!",

    "text": "Home of Charlotte's one and only veggie corn dog!  And, it's a really good veggie corn dog to boot.  I'm not a vegetarian but definitely prefer veggie hot dogs to real hot dogs (for nutrition reasons, not taste).  I have ordered their veggie hot dog with veggie chili as well and often crave it.  So, needless to say yesterday when I visited, it was a tough decision between the new corn dog or the chili hot dog.  I wasn't disappointed.  I also had their homemade slaw (delicious!) and their appetizer order of hush puppies (a HUGE order for under $3 and they were mouthwatering with the tarter sauce).  Mmmm!  Next time I want to try the waffle fries with chili and cheese (duh, of course).    The location is the only real downside to this joint.  It borders a not-so-great part of town so I will probably only visit this place for lunch.  There's plenty of parking across the street so don't be fooled by the small lot.  The inside is funky and fun and the staff is cool.  All in all, it's a fun place to eat and it helps that the food is good.",

I finally caved in after seeing some of the reviews here and just had to check it out.  Me and some others decided to head over for lunch on a Monday and with the weather being so fantastic were lucky enough to enjoy some of the semi-outdoor  seating (covered but with large garage doors opening up to the outside).  Our order looked something like this...  Hush Puppies to start.....  The food was awesome if you are in a burger, hot dog and fried food type of mood. I cant say enough about the service. Out waitress was really laid back but attentive and personable.  I'll give 4/5 because of the pricing. Although I wouldn't call this place expensive by any sense of the word the pricing did seem a bit off. For example, some things felt over-priced in comparison to other items on the menu.  On the other hand, you couldn't beat the pitcher price of $9 for Shock Top. That was a deal we couldn't pass up.  All in all, a great experience for awesome food, incredible service and a fantastic little outdoor seating area.",

I've never ordered something new and been disappointed, so that wins points in my book.  My only problem is that every time I want to try the taco special they're already out of it, but then again I don't always eat my meals at a respectable hour.   Service is usually great- but sometimes just good, mixed drinks have never seemed weak, and you can't complain about the music or the nightly specials. I can take my parents there when they're in town or I can have a less respectable evening throwing back a few with friends, but best of all I could close my eyes and point to anything on the menu and be pretty satisfied with whatever it was, and the price attached to it.",

    "text": "Well, Pinky's can add another good review to their ever-growing list.  My only gripe with this place is that it is no longer right next to my residence in Midwood in its former incarnation as the Penguin.  That said, I'm thrilled that this little corner of Morehead St. is getting some love with new restaurants and yoga studios, and since it's so close to Uptown, it's not too out of the way to visit.  I actually like this venue much better than the Penguin. As others have noted, the space at Pinky's is not just larger but nicer (the lighting, maybe?)  It has a really great ambiance and excellent jukebox.  We went on a weekend night, and they had great pitcher specials and very friendly service for our somewhat large group.  And, of course, the fried pickles were amazing--best in Charlotte, in my opinion.  I only had a veggie corndog, sans sides, which seemed a little skimpy to me given the price, but I'm going to expand my menu horizons at a later date and report back accordingly.   In sum and in conclusion, I think this is a great place for a quick bite or to visit after work to unwind with a beer and a snack.",

    "text": "Yum.   Warning: Expect a wait; but the wait is well worth it!   My order: Fried pickles and the Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich (herb coated turkey breast on a big bun, topped with melted provolone, bacon, basil, tomato & garlic-parmesan spread). Highly recommend the kinda fried turkey sammy. Pinky's deep-fries a full turkey that is completely herb coated then slices the turkey for the sandwiches. The turkey was moist, falls apart in your mouth and is extremely flavorful (probably the best tasting turkey I've ever had). The garlic parmesan spread was a perfect compliment to the turkey. The sandwich was so delicious that when I go back, I will definitely want to order this sandwich again due to fear that I might be semi-disappointed with a different dish (which I'm sure is unlikely).   In regards to the fried pickles, they were also delightful - but I've noticed it's nearly impossible to screw up fried pickles.   Also, they have diet cheerwine on \"tap.\" Doesn't get much better than that.   My bf had the Big John (6 oz chicken breast, fried or grilled topped with swiss cheese, bacon, honey mustard, lettuce & tomato on a seeded bun) with the vegetarian chili. He really enjoyed his meal as well - unfortunately, I can't comment any further as I didn't taste test them myself.   Our server was attentive but not overbearing and the prices are affordable.   If you haven't eaten at Pinky's yet you must add it to your \"restaurant I want to eat at list\" - or go there right now!",

Painted red, white, and blue, the 1960's-era Volkswagen Beetle sits on the roof of a former car repair shop at the intersection of Morehead Street and Freedom Drive and is now home to Pinky's Westside Grill!  When we arrived there was a small wait. Since we prefer to sit at the bar we walked right in (HINT HINT).  Up at the bar there are a couple of TV's for game days.  No alcohol yet but they are apparently in works to have it soon.  We took the bartender's suggestions on our food order.  1) Ding Dong Chicken:  Thai inspired grilled marinated chicken breast served on a bun with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha sauce, and honey cilantro slaw.  Sounds odd and had he not recommended it we would have never ordered it.  Different but really good!  I recommend you trying it too.  2)  Fish Tacos:  Two beer battered tilapia tacos on flour tortillas with cilantro-honey slaw and spicy ranch, served with a side of black beans.  Fun place to experience!  Give it a shot!",

    "text": "The thing I love most about Pinky's is that the menu is much different than you'd expect. It's not just burgers and fries like most places - they have unique menu items from gyro's to crab puppies to tacos. And it's not just throwing a bunch of stuff together, either - each item is carefully made to perfection. The joint is kind of divey and fun, and each of the waiters and waitresses help each other, which I find very sweet and awesome. They just remodeled the patio area and it's got a stellar view of Uptown. This place also has awesome drink specials and an entire cocktail menu under $5. It's seriously got it all! It's even a Pokemon gym, lol! I recommend the shrimp tacos, as they're my favorite, but I assure you that anything you try will be amazing. This is a Charlotte landmark and somewhere I always take people that are visiting from out of town. Don't just take my word, it's also Guy Fieri's favorite Charlotte dive!",

We were there abt 6:00, so the place was virtually empty before dinner. Only two of our party of three had arrived. My guest was from out of state, and we just wanted to sit at a table with a beer and talk while we waited 5 minutes for the 3rd person. The staff member ultimately did seat just the two of us, after a bit of discussion.",

Service is always friendly and I've been going here since they opened. I've literally never had anything but a really great time. The food is made with love. Pinky's does a great job of balancing their menu to make everyone happy. They have really good burgers (my boyfriend's favorite in the city) and equally yummy vegetarian options.   Good cocktails, big portions, quality ingredients and delicious food in a fun atmosphere. So glad we have Pinky's!",

Noticed that the interior featured the macabre.....skulls, skeletons and the like, which I love!   Seating is close together in this small, but charming spot.  Good wine specials,  but my husband was a bit dismayed to see a half inch head on his first draft beer (second one was better).  I was thrilled to see vegan and vegetarian options on the menu.  I ordered the tahini salad, which featured falafel on greens with feta, tomato, cucumber and onion.  Plus, a tahini dressing that wasn't bad.  Salad for days, so I shared with the husband.  He got the turkey burger and also ended up ordering fried pickles, which were delightfully crispy and served with plentiful Ranch dressing. I didn't like that everything came in paper, except for the drinks.  I am sure it saves them on dish washing, but I like eating from real plates and bowls, especially salad. The host and all of the servers were extra sweet.  That is a plus in this age of rude and abrupt. Bottom line:  I wanna go again!",

That and the fact that I worked in food service was not a good incentive to go out of my way to dine. I am retired now and looking forward to trying all these good eats I have heard about over the years. Top of my list was Pinkey's which is located in the old auto shop and the VW is still on the roof.     I was not disappointed. My shrimp was lightly breaded and I loved, loved, loved the tartar sauce. The onions rings were like the beer battered ones I make at home, thin and lightly breaded. The chili on the waffle fries was like what my Dad made, just all meat good chili. A friend ordered the corn dog shrimp which he gobbled up. What I am telling you is everything tasted like someone cared.   Service was excellent. Stephanie the manager of the day was so friendly and very attentive. Everyone took the time to be gracious. Now that being said, this was on a Monday evening at 6:00.  I know things will get crazy when they are slammed. But the food and the atmosphere are worth it. And remember that it takes time to make food handmade. Don't be in a hurry for good food someone cared about before it got to you.  Food portions are huge. Three of us shared the Pimp'n Fries. And the eclectic mix of customers is amazing.  You could have a doctor at one table and a truck driver at the next. One thing they have in common. They know where the good food is.",

I stopped here today with a colleague and I was beyond impressed with the quality of food, ambiance, and attentiveness of the wait staff.  We ordered the Fried Pickles and the Pimento Cheese Fries as appetizers, both of which were full of flavor and cooked just right.  There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try but figured I had to go with a burger on my first trip.  I ended up deciding on the Mammoth Westside Burger that had mustard, chili, slaw, and onions.  For some reason 5 oz. sounded really small so i ordered the Mammoth which had two 5 oz. patties.  Anyone else wondering the same thing, one patty would have been plenty!  Don't get me wrong the Mammoth was really, really good, but it was definitely a lot of meat.  I'm a huge fan of a restaurant that can get away with playing heavy metal music and not have it take away from the total experience.  From the artwork hanging on the wall to the slug bug on the roof, this place is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.  I've read some reviews about people getting sick (my wife was one of them!) but it's been about 10 hours now since eating there and I've had no issue.  I guess check back in a few days to see if I've updated my review :)",

The inside of the place was super cool and unique, too, and I couldn't help but snap a bunch of photos while I was there.

SERVICE: I have noticed that a lot of local places, especially the ones that have enjoyed some fame from being on a Food Network show, coast on their reputation and do not pay much attention to service. Pinky's is not like that. The server was friendly, the food came out quickly, my glass was refilled promptly, and it really seemed like the people working here enjoy it.  PRICE: I would say the prices here are about average. Don't expect to pay McDonald's prices (don't expect McDonald's food either), but you also won't be asked to spend an arm and a leg. Burgers and fries will set you back around $10.  FOOD: The menu is fairly diverse, while not being so large that newcomers have no idea what to order. There are plenty of burger options, plenty of side options, and plenty of other menu items for those not wanting a burger or wanting to change it up. I would highly suggest ordering an appetizer of fried pickles- they really are like nothing you've had before. The only menu item that I've had that I do not care for are the onion rings. They are very thin (\"horseshoe\" onion rings), which I do not care for. Everything else is great.  Pinky's is one of my go-to places for late night food in Charlotte. It's a Charlotte staple, and I would recommend it to everyone.",

I got a Shirley Temple and the Corn Dog Shrimp basket -- there is a plentiful amount of salty waffle fries in the basket, and it's topped with amazing corn dog battered shrimp. Try the wasabi ranch -- it was pretty light and gave the fries and the shrimp a good spicy kick. The Shirley Temple was a good complement to the food -- sweet with a good pineapple taste.  The service was quick and easy and the food was amazing! I'm definitely putting this place on my rotation.",

Now it's fried food but there are some healthy options, although I would suggest the corn dog shrimp and popcorn chicken buffalo style.  The music's a little loud and the wait staff are hipsters.  I wouldn't take my parents here because I feel they would be annoyed by the loudness.  But, if you don't mind loud music and want a good affordable meal this is the place.  A PBR pitcher is like $5 which is awesome!  Good selection of North Carolina brews.  They have wine and liquor drinks as well as daily drink specials.  So, if you haven't been, give it a shot!",

    "text": "Best place in Charlotte I'very found for burgers & I've looked all over.  A lot of the other highly rated burger places have decent burgers but are more of a hangout spot & thus highly rated. Pinky's is a quaint little spot where you go for the food & drinks, not because you know all your friends will be there on a saturday night.  All the components on the burger are excellent, fresh jalapenos,  leaf lettuce, ripe tomato,  soft bun, tender good quality beef, nice size patty & excellent value!!!  This is one of those places that a keen eye can discern that a lot of work went into every ingredient that goes into their menu items.  I don't believe it gets the credit it deserves due to the fact that the burgers are only $4-5!  Great waffle fries & lots of other great options for meat eaters & vegetarians alike.  Atmosphere & service have always been very good as well.  FYI....I wrote this review after going there about 10 times & always enjoying the food but the last time I went I felt inclined to write a review (which I never do) because I got the white trash burger with everything on it, simply put, the best burger I've ever had in Charlotte.  One more thing....to the person below that claims to have gotten sick from Pinky's, maybe check your medications because getting food poisoning twice from the same place is extremely unlikely especially if your visits aren't close together & I've been here about 10 times without any issues & my team goes there every week after our game without issues so I'm to assume it's you & not the establishment.",

Kinda small and could pose difficulties parking if it was a full house but the decor was chill (used to be an old mechanics shop) and beer selection seems just fine. There's a good assortment of meat-lover's and veggie-lover's grub. Sandwiches are served al a carte but really is enough even when you're super hungry. None-the-less I got some perfectly cooked sweet potatoe fries. From what I saw of the place, I wouldn't recommend it for large groups so have no more than 4 ppl in the group. Just a suggestion. Otherwise, friendly people, good food and good atmosphere!",

    "text": "I had high hopes after hearing that one of the former owners of the Penguin ran this restaurant, but my trip there on Sunday, 1/29/12, was incredibly disgusting and disappointing.  Our table ordered a variety of appetizers to share, included the felafel balls, Pimp'n Fries, and hushpuppies.  The felafel was tasteless and overcooked, the fries were soft and greasy, and the hushpuppies were just ok.  Nothing to brag about, but certainly the better order.   My lunch order was a Pterodactyl burger with everything.  Not a bad price, but having to pay extra for a side of fries made the price misleading.  I opted to share fries with someone else.  The burger was greasy, literally dripping with grease, and completely covered in mayonnaise.  I scraped the majority of the mayo off, but after that I couldn't get over the amount of grease.    I also had a few fried pickles, but at glancing the bottom of the container which was holding a standing level of grease, I was disgusted.  Of all the fried items, we reached a consensus that either the oil is old or was not hot enough.  Everything was soaked in oil and overcooked.  I can appreciate a good burger joint, but this was beyond terrible.  It's possible to have fried food that doesn't drip with oil.  Even the sweet potato fries were soaked in it.  I will never return.    I also had a horrible bout of food poisoning that night.  I won't be so quick to blame this particular restaurant, but it was the only thing I ate out of the ordinary that day, so make your own judgment.",

The guy who use to run the kitchen at Penguin when it was on 'Diners, Drive Ins & Dives' owns this place, so there are some similarities.  The menu is much more diverse though.  They DO have healthier options.  My girlfriend and I were turned on to the Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich by the bartender one night.  We never really considered it because I just never felt compelled to order a turkey sandwich at a place known for burgers.  Boy, did my opinion change quickly.  That sandwich is amazing.  The meat is so juicy, it's pure bliss.  She usually orders that and I always get the burger, westside style (chili, coleslaw, mustard) and add pimiento cheese and bacon.  BEST BURGER EVER.  The chili, cheddar, and pimiento cheese waffle fries are also one of our favorites.  Pair all of this up with a tall boy of Genesee cream ale and you're set.  We can usually get out of Pinky's with a meal and drinks for 2 around $30.  In other words, a steal.",

On a side note, they have 2 locations. Their location in Uptown(Downtown) its usually crowded and maybe that is why some of the staff is less friendly. But good news!, their second location with the same food and better service, plus is less crowded. Is just a bit off north (i77 exit 23). Go there and enjoy it.",

I've eaten there about 6 times in the last year, most recently last Saturday and although they are almost always busy they do a great job of getting you a table quickly, usualy end up waiting 5-10 minutes or sit at the bar.  Started with the Pimpn Fries, I recommend adding the bacon...everything is better with bacon.  Had the fish tacos and they were lightly battered and perfectly crispy.    Overall it's a fun place for a quick out of the ordinary lunch.  Highly recommended.",

All around there is a very comfortable dinner atmosphere.  My favorite thing about Pinky's is there drink menu. They have a good verity of beer and liquor. Not to mention, so far, they make the best Manhattan in town and it's relatively cheap. They all kinds of different and good drinks, along with specials every night of the week.  The food is good quality for a dinner. They even have a vegetarian menu with vegan items listed, which is always appreciated by me. My favorite item so far is the tahini salad, mostly because of the falafels, they are very good though a little greasy, but isn't that what dinner food is about?",

I've ate here several times, got something different each time and I've always left euphoric. I usually start with their crab hushpuppies; crunchy, slightly sweet, and perfectly complemented by spicy ranch sauce. Their burgers are good quality and very flavorful too. I tried the ding dong style, and the eclectic mix of sweet peanut butter and spicy sriracha do wonders. I was skeptical beforehand but they've made a believer out of me.   Great value, excellent food, and relatively close to BoA Stadium have made Pinky's one of my new favorite burger joints. Well worth the five minute drive from uptown.",

Come get us, they're saying. Quick, before we get soggy.  So, what is it that makes the place so good? Consistency. It isn't the quality of food - which at Pinky's is obviously artery-clogging. It isn't anything cutting edge or challenging, introducing you to new, wondrous flava combos. It's the fact that every time, every time I order those damn fries, they're a teetering, steaming mound of volcanic-hot waffles covered with perfectly browned cheese, a precisely-measured dollop of chili almost-omg-almost spilling past the wax paper keeping it all contained for the walk from the window to the table. 5 times now. A piece of food sculpture, almost. I stare at them for just a sec, enjoying them as an object, before diving in, forks flying. Recent discovery - yellow mustard is killer as a dip.  They set a high bar, only to be approached by the corn dog and pickles. Falafel's getting better, but is still eh. Burger, pasty, good. Salads are totally edible, if you must, but not impressive. But the pickles, those gonna-be-the-huge-gut-of-me fries, and the corndog, at least one of the three has to head down my esophagus weekly or this happens - craving to the point of distraction.  You win, Pinky's. You win.",

I'd rather get them on the side of my burger than fries - they're that good. They're exactly the right ratio of salty pickle to crisp breading.   You also have to try at least one thing \"Ding Dong Style.\" I would never have thought of putting peanut butter and saracha on a sandwich, but as a combo, it can't be beat! The Ding Dong Chicken is one of my favorites.  The wait staff is always fast, friendly and helpful, too, so it's a pleasure to grab a bite here.",

Told seater I had a part of 2, do you have a table available. He told me they do but since my full party was not present, they couldn't sit me. I responded that she was parking. He said still he could not. So i said, well do you have a table for one, he said yes but you are a party of 2 and have to wait.  Now I can see if I was a party of 5 and we was waiting on 3 or 4 of the group... but any table that seats one, seats 2... WHATS THE BIG DEAL.

White Trash burger is the way to go (comes with fried pickles on it). They do different drink specials every night of the week (like craft beer roulette on Fridays which is fun), and their drink menu is overwhelmingly long. Only downfall is no matter when you go, this place is always packed. But if you have to wait, it typically doesn't take too long because the servers all split tables.

And then when you walk in you'll see its pretty small and cramped. The pictures and stuff hanging on the wall also make it feel more cramped. Its not a dinner place, so don't look for fancy decor and  stuff. The food is good. Nothing spectacular, but it's still really good. I suggest that you go there and see for yourself. It really depends on what king of person you are. I recommend sitting outside, but not if you're allergic to/ scared of bees. I think there might be a beehive somewhere in the plants or on the building. They may have gotten that resolved but it wasn't much of a problem. It wasn't a bad problem. About 4 bees, just annoying. The area is nice though and its still a pretty cool place to get lunch.",

You're going to be served on a paper plate and eating with a plastic fork. The decor is very eclectic.   Went between lunch and dinner on a Saturday afternoon and it was still slammed. We sat at the bar, and I didn't expect them to have such a good drink/beer selection.   Started with the pimpin fries-- a must order. Waffle fries covered in pimento cheese. What more could you ever want in life.   I ordered the Big John Chicken Sandwich and it was very good. Boyfriend got a burger that was almost too huge to eat. We shared a side of the homemade chips. Next time I am definitely getting the Reuben Dog. Really want to try their homemade veggie burger as well!   You really get a lot for the money here. Great spot for when you are looking for something casual or are *cough* hungover *cough*.   Park in the Pinkys spaces at Dunkin Donuts across the street!",

And, when we were leaving we wanted to purchase a couple t-shirts. The hostess has just one party of 2 waiting for a table   She was less than helpful when it came to assisting with the purchase.

Pinky's has its own random quirk which is apparent when you walk in the door, there are so many things to stare at.   My boyfriend and I have been dying to come here so we already knew what we wanted to attack. What really surprised me here, were the prices!! My god it was such a cheap meal and needless to say guilty satisfying too! We ordered the pimp'n fries with vegetarian chili to start...SO GOOD. The pimento cheese really made this app, the chili though is not as flavorful as the Chili Man's vegan chili (hollaaa!) I couldn't get enough and they were huge...I was basically full before even ordering the entree.   I got the corn dog jumbo shrimp while my bf ordered the white trash style chicken sandwich. I wish I would have replaced the fries my entree came with for something else like the black eyed pea salad..I can't believe I'm saying this, but I was all fryed out...ME..fryed out. Pinky's accomplished that. The corn dog shrimp themselves were AMAZING..the corn dog batter was almost sweet and cooked to a perfect crunch. The shrimp was huge and juicy. The buckets also come with amazing and flavorful  dipping sauces, they are huge. I got the spicy ranch, nomz, creamy deliciousness. The coleslaw that came with the chicken sandwich was really good too, I'm not a fan of coleslaw normally. Had minimal mayonnaise and I could feel the texture and taste the cabbage and other veggies. We waddled out of there  Our servers were great! Very nice and attentive. Banana pudding, we are coming back for you. And basically everything else. They have great drink specials too, Tuesdays are $2.50 drafts. Cheers!",

The buffalo shrimp tacos had too much blue cheese crumbles that it over powered the buffalo sauce, had I to scrape some of them off. The black beans that accompanied the tacos were just ok.

It does not matter the day or the time, Pinky's is always packed. However, the waiting time is not bad since they have many tables.  The parking at the restaurant is pretty small however they have a parking lot a few steps from the restaurants that fits a lot of cars.  Everything they serve is good, but I always go with the shrimp corn dog and the waffle fries. They are my favorite and I can't go there without having them! One one my friends had a chicken sandwich that she said was good and the other one had the white trash burger with some fried squash that she really enjoyed. My meal as always was really good!  The servers are nice and attentive. Since they are always busy the food can take a little while to get ready so if you are in a rush this is definitely not the place for you.  The decoration is cool and different and their prices are great! I didn't know they had banana pudding but reading the reviews on Yelp I found that they served some pretty good one. I had to find out myself and was really surprised! It costed a little bit over 3$ and was so much banana pudding that I had to take home to share with my husband! I highly recommend this place!",

Located in a the corner of a busy intersection, they only have 3 parking spots in the parking lot in front of the restaurant. You will have to park in a dirt lot located behind the business. Not an issue unless its raining.   I ordered the Pimpin' french fries with chili as an appetizer and they were delicious! Order a side a ranch, just to make it a tad healthier ;) Loved the waffle cut fries they use for this dish because it allows for more surface for the cheese and chili! Maybe I would add jalapenos next time too! I ordered a White Trash Cheese burger and I will never order a cheese burger another way!! This cheese burger came with pickles and fried onion strips.. YUMMM... I added some mustard and maybe would have added some jalapenos as well.. .but that might just be my pregnancy craving at the moment. HAHA.

Cooked very well and juicy, but there was hardly any sauce, the fried toppings were bland, and it just wasn't what I was expecting with such rave reviews. The fried squash was my favorite part. Very good.  Wait staff was great and I was seated quickly. The atmosphere was awesome and laid back. I think if I was going to drink with friends, instead of eat, I would have been much more pleased.   Overall, cool place, but the food is just typical bar food for the most part.

The service was good, I never had to ask to refill my drink, but I will say at times they can be bothersome with how often they approach you. The restaurant isn't huge so I felt like they were trying to turn tables quickly. Within 5 minutes of sitting down five different people had asked us if we were ready to order. We ordered an appetizer just to get them away for a bit. So if you're trying to take your time this might not be the place to go.",

I had the Kickin' Chicken tacos and they were definitely pretty tasty although they were on of the more boring things I could have ordered.   They do something here called Ding Dong Style which is the combination of crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and hot sriracha sauce to top a burger or tacos. It wasn't exactly my thing, but I gotta applaud a place that's willing to take a chance on an unlikely combo.   Considering the dirt cheap price tag and the entertaining environment I'd definitely give Pinky's another go if I'm in this part of Charlotte.",

    "text": "I ordered two of the kickin' chicken tacos with onion rings as sides, the mammoth white trash burger, and banana pudding. We waited forty minutes to get our food because they had to remake the tacos with the sauce on the side and then they forgot to even give us our onion rings so we were missing food even after that long of a wait. The burger was bland and dry. The bananas in the banana pudding were black like they had been left out for who knows how long. Then when you try to call them they can't hear a word I'm saying and only offer to have me come and get onion rings after all the time I already waited.  I thought this place had amazing reviews after so many people going there and I'm just disappointed in service.   Also there was no seating when we went so my mom and I sat at a table to take a rest for a minute a waitress rudely told us we need to leave and get up. She could've had some common courtesy.   The only plus was that the kickin' chicken tacos had good flavor. So just be warned with what kind of service your going to get coming to this establishment.  UPDATE: I would just like to thank Andy and the manager I spoke to, I couldn't remember the manager's name but he was amazing! I came in giving Pinky's another chance after speaking to Andy and I would just like to commend this restaurant for making things better than right. I had a much better experience and would like to thank the staff/manager/Andy. Plus I haven't had good chicken tacos since I was in California and this is as close to home as they can get. I would eat the Kickin' Chicken Tacos everyday of the week.",

They had great service. The menu was very diverse. I got the Pterodactyl burger Westside Style, Sweet Potato Fries, and Wasabi Ranch for fry dipping. The burger was good just nothing life changing. The fries were fresh and I loved the ranch I wanted to buy a bottle of it. Didn't drink but their drink menu looked very good! Would recommend & will be going back.",

It is a very small place with a very tiny parking lot (more space down the road) and they will want you to go when you've finished enjoying your burger.  I opted for the double burger with cheddar plus fries. It didn't take too long to arrive. Two large 5 ounce patties with all the toppings on a nice bun. The meat was hot and drippy and delicious. Waffle fries were fresh and hot, soaking up ketchup very nicely.  I chose the $3 beer special, which is a random can or bottle of whatever they want to move quickly. It was a tasty milk stout that I enjoyed.  Our waitress was nice about wanting us to move along - there were at least forty people waiting to get in.",

Nice hidden gem just on the outside of uptown walking distance from the panthers stadium.   Thanks guys!",

I got the mammoth w/ pepper jack & American, my other half got a triple w/ everything.. our burgers were a little ridiculous, but the best ridiculous way. However I will say, their onion rings are not onion rings. They're onion straws!   The other night I ordered through take out. Again, got the mammoth for the smoldering cheese but they put 2 kinds of the wrong cheese on my burger. I was pretty sad about it, but I will definitely be back for another dine in experience.",

The bun was so flat and wet you couldn't even pick up the sandwich.  I asked for a new bun twice and they brought me the same thing again each time.  The bartender said they switched the  brand of buns.  I personally don't like to pay good money for cheaper quality food.  The little paper tray was so small,  it was practically useless to hold the sandwich.  I think if you are part of the downtown hip crowd maybe it's no big deal,  it's a bar with food.   I guess I expect better than that.  It will be awhile before I go back to this location.  But I don't think they are hurtling for business so I doubt my review will change anything.",

On Thursdays $5 Unicorn Tears are my Discount Jam! Daily Drink Specials! Good selection of local beers!  Hot Dogs, Burgers, Vegetarian options - the Nature Boy (black bean burger) is pretty good. Solid appetizers too like fried pickles and Crab Puppies (kinda like hush puppies with crabmeat in the batter).  If you drive by and think it's too crowded, it may not be. The front lot is small! There's always room to park in Pinky's rear...hehe ... yeah, I said it...  Good place to bring out of towners for a little local flavor.  Pinky's makes me happy!",

    "text": "I was visiting Charlotte for a business trip and decided to stop into Pinky's based on the strong recommendations printed in various Charlotte-area promotional magazines. Well that was a big mistake. The first thing you'll notice when you step inside the building is a plethora of bigoted, hate-filled Democrat Party propaganda stuck all over the walls of the establishment. My (least) favorite of these items was an absolutely disgusting sticker containing a photo of the former NC governor with a drawn-on Hitler mustache containing the words \"Rat McCrory.\" Lovely... call everyone you disagree with politically \"Hitler,\" as if there is any kind of equivalency between the HB2 law and the slaughter of 6 million innocent people. There was similar hateful material strewn across their walls that ruined my appetite while I waited for my meal.  I got a double burger with fries. While they did give me a lot of fries, there was nothing exciting about this meal. The burger was dry, really dry, and not too big either. The bread was not particularly soft and felt stale. The waffle fries lacked flavor and needed a heavy dose of salt and pepper.    I guess the reason why they're promoted so heavily in Charlotte magazines has more to do with their politics aligning with the editors of those publications, rather than their food, because the food was not good. Stay away.  UPDATE 2/19/18: The business owner had the audacity to respond to my review with the ridiculous notion that equating Republicans with a German dictator who murdered 6 million Jews is \"LOVE.\" I don't know whether to laugh at a ghastly attempt at black humor, or to cry that our world would consider an act of pure HATRED for other human beings advertised on the wall of this business as an act of LOVE.",

Had that not been available, I don't know where we would have parked.  Our wait for a table was only 20 minutes or so.  They do a \"shared\" wait staff approach.  Its awesome as you have someone checking on you regularly but not annoying.  Great beer selection.  Seating was comfortable... no cramming 5 people into a space for 3.  :-)  The burgers were out of this world!  All the food was fantastic.  My 19 y/o and I had the Triple G.  I took it down!  Wifey had the Maddy Patty Melt my other teenager had the Ding Dong Chicken and my younger son had chicken tenders.  The dies were awesome too.",

Next.  Waffle fries!  You can't mess them up right?  Womp womp! They're barely cooked, and like a mountain of flimsy tasteless sadness there they go...into the garbage where they belong after one bit.  That being said it was my first visit, and all my friends say the burgers are great!  But for me...I will just skip lunch if this is my only option.  P.S.  I climbed on the  the Triceratops! P.s.s.

The fish tacos were equally terrific with tasty, fresh ingredients.  Service was spot on.  The servers all worked every table as a team, which definitely contributed to the fantastic vibe.

    "text": "It's good to see that Pinky's has finally got it together.  This is reviewing the take out at Pinky's.  After having two take-out orders previously, we (3 of us from work) were very disappointed in the quality of food vs the price.   This time was a welcome change as the food was hot, fresh, correct, and very tasty.  Since we use to make the trek to the penguin, one would expect a few changes and breaking in period before the same level of quality would be reached here at Pinky's......well, let me tell you, the food is good!  My secret to having takeout is to place the order between 11:00 - 11:20am , that way you are one of the first ones to be in the restaurant when the other folks are just getting ready to head to lunch.  No lines, no looking for parking spaces, but let me assure you, eating at that early time slot takes some getting use to unless you are still in high school where lunch starts around 10:45am.  So I had the mammoth burger, 2-5 oz patties, with provolone cheese and bacon.  My Grease-O-Meter was running hot, and there is just nothing like having a big huge piece of hot meat in your mouth with a little cheese and bacon, oozing out of the corner of your mouth......OMG that sounded kinda gross when you read that didn't it.  (SORRY) we are talking about the burger!  My co-worker had the buffalo bites, I stole one from his plate while I was bringing the food back to work, and I must say that was delicious! Ssshhh don't say anything, but I had to ask him how they were, so he offered (another) chicken bite so that I may taste it. Just like the first one, it was excellent! I would consider the buffalo chicken bites next time as it did come with fries, unlike the burgers.    I give these guys a fighting chance.....after all you have to be tough to have a name like Pinky's on the West Side of Charlotte.  Overall, this location has greatly improved. I am only speaking of the takeout as I just do not have enough time at lunch to dine in and review the service of a full meal.  If you like the Penguin, you'll get a the same type of feeling here, good food, small space, no parking, long lines, and yes, some pricey food.    Located (For us cool kids ....across the street from \"The Pterodactyl Club\")  (Now bulldozed and no longer a part of the scenery - RIP)  Located for the newbies to Charlotte, at the corner of Morehead St and the intersection of Freedom Dr.  NCFoodGuy",

I don't think I've ever had a fried pickle I didn't like, until today. They had a smoky flavor...not sure if it was the batter but it was probably the worst I've had. I got the white trash burger and it lived up to the name. Just a mediocre burger. Not a whole lot of flavor. The waffle fries were decent but better at Chick-Fil-A. For the price, what you get is okay but I would rather spend more money and get something delicious. I really wanted to like this place but at the end of the day, I just don't. We won't be recommending Pinky's or returning.",

Otherwise I still feel that the portions are large and the service and amazing vibe made up for it.",

    "text": "Great place!  Been wanting to make my way here for the longest time, but actually went last Saturday when I happened to be in the neighborhood.  First thing that you get hit with before you even set foot in Pinky's is the character the place offers.  I think a couple of years back, people were trying to save the location since it had become an \"eyesore.\"  Pinky's has a trademark volkswagon on it's roof (lookin' sharp with a new paint job) and I am really happy to see that they kept the original volkswagon service sign out front.  Other outdoor items to note are the large garage doors that can be opened during good weather... makes for a really cool eating place and indoor/outdoor space.  My other personal favorite is the triceratops statue sitting out in front of the building.  I was a sucker for triceratops as a little kid and apparently I am still a little kid since I am a sucker for it now.  The food:  We were immediately greeted and seated and beers magically appeared on the table.  I decided to try the popcorn chicken basket since I was feeling hungry and craving some waffle fries.  The food came out quickly and was devoured quickly... hitting all the right spots.  I was a little less adventurous my first trip, but I plan to make a triumphant return and try the more exotic/unique menu items!",

Especially since I have never been to Pinky's and Pinky's has so much that I like:  Fried Pickles,  Hot Chip's (not the dancers) made to order (these are the thinnest and Best Potato Chips I have ever eaten), Onion Rings (sliced very thin and very lightly battered), Hot Dogs made to order (he wrote it down and they executed it perfectly - no slaw, light on the chili, super light on the mustard, 100% Beef frank, heavy on the ONION), Fried Squash, Cheerwine Cake, Sunkist Cake.  Team oriented staff took very good care of me (yeah  was alone and ate it all - if you think I'm a pig consider this...  Before arriving at Pinky's I ate a full lunch at 1:00pm and I got here at 2:00pm so uuuhhhh - I'm not a pig I'm a wild Boar.  Sweet Tarts for dinner!    What would I recommend?  Bring at least three people with you so you can have a taste of everything or just invite me and you'll be able to maintain your diet because I will eat it all!  I haven't finished with their menu yet!  When I go back I will get the sweet potato fries, repeat the onion rings and chips and check out something else.  The Cheerwine Cake I do recommend the Sunkist cake was good though not my preference.  Would definitely repeat the hot dog, maybe the fried pickles, though not the fried squash.  If you are a fan of Grease (not the movie) you may find Pinky's slightly on the light side.  Though plenty greasy for me it was not as greasy as I imagined!  If I say \"the diet starts Monday\" will you read my reviews for Monday, cause I'm going out and I doubt there will be any restraint!",

Service raises the bar on how other places operate. Atmosphere is fun. Good drink menu. And a great place to learn more about Westside trends back in the 70's & 80's.  So far I've tried: Fried Pickles;  this is Charlotte's original recipe. Stray Dog; a veggie dog w/ veggie chili perfect for someone like me that wants a dog but doesn't eat beef. I'm addicted to these. Da Pimp; grilled pimento cheese. I didn't like PC but love theirs. Banana Pudding; Oh! So! Good! Ding Dong Chicken;  fried chicken breast w/ crunchy peanut butter & siracha. Crazy good! Be sure when you visit to get a pic w/the Pinkymobile.",

Initially, I thought the bar staff had too much attitude for my taste, but we were blessed with a super friendly server who made up for my initial reaction.  Being dairy and gluten-free, it's sometimes hard to find things to eat on the menu, but I was super excited to find potato-crusted tilapia to satisfy the fried fish craving I had been having all day.  Along with waffle fries, it felt great to participate in a booze and fried food fest.  I'm totally in love with the drink menu.  I had a delicious spicy hot ginger spiced rum concoction, and have begun a quest to try every drink on the menu.  Service was quick, and to be fair my group was pretty rowdy, and though we may have been slightly disruptive to other patrons, (sorry, people), it was never an issue.  Hoping to make this a habit :)",

    "text": "Ok so I was excited about this place opening before the whole #penguingate thing happened. However, since that did happen my first trip to Pinky's was to compare the offerings.   I got what I usually get, a burger (Pterodactyl Burger west side style in this case), half order of fried pickles, and banana pudding at the end.   Everything is just as good as I remember, all of it made even better by the free Yuengling, though I hope they get their ABC license soon just so I can have a variety to choose from. First test passed.  My second trip I wanted to try something new so I tried the fish taco. Not the best I`ve had in Charlotte but, pretty darn good. Personally I think I will stick with just ordering burgers in future, but it's always good to have choices. Second test passed, but with a slightly lower grade.  On top of the good food this place is alot closer to where I live now! I like the location, just the parking is horrible. I am not a fan of crossing freedom drive.   Overall, I like Pinky's and I will be going back for years to come.",

I ended up switching to take out because my waitress was so rude to me when she finally came over to take my order. I don't plan on ever coming back, but I give the owner credit.  He is totally professional, and runs an overall good business, but I don't know where he hired his wait staff from.  I wouldn't recommend coming here at night to hang out unless you're into the whole biker, tattoo thing.  That's the crowd I always see drinking there and it can get a little ghetto on the weekend nights.  Even the waitresses look like that.  Just not my crowd, but it could be your thing.",

    "text": "lara's review!  my dad is in town this week, and we were able to go out for lunch together one day.  i told him about a new place called pinky's that i recently heard about.  it's totally up his alley (and mine) because we both love burger dives.  located at the corner of freedom and morehead, it's not in the best part of town, so i probably wouldn't go there after dark, but i felt totally fine going there for lunch.  we saw all sorts of characters - business people out for lunch, moms and their kids, and lots of funky tattooed folks who work there.  i love places that attract an eclectic bunch, so to me, this was a sign that the food would be good, and was it ever.  my dad got the ding dong style burger, and i got the maddy patty melt.  we shared a basket of fried pickles.  the ding dong style burger was crazy but delicious, according to my dad.  it's a burger with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce.  he loved the flavor explosion, and said he would order it again.  my maddy patty melt was equally good.  it's a five ounce burger with grilled onions, 1000 island dressing, swiss and american cheese hot pressed between two slices of texas toast.  it almost tasted like a burger covered in pimento cheese, with a little bit of a kick.  i would definitely order it again . . . although, i have to admit, the white trash burger caught my eye, and i don't think i'll be able to pass it up next time.  it's a five ounce burger with provolone, fried pickles, onion rings and spicy ranch sauce.  how good does that sound?  our basket of fried pickles was the best i've ever had.  they were thinly sliced and lightly fried (is that an oxymoron?), and the ranch dipping sauce was perfect - not too thick, so it didn't overwhelm the flavor of the pickles, but complimented them perfectly.  the portions were not huge, which usually annoys me, but, in this case, the portion was perfect for a lunchtime burger.  i didn't leave feeling stuffed, and i was pleasantly full.  our burgers were between $4-$5 each, and the pickles were about $4, so it's a total \"cheap eats\" place.  the service was great even though the place was packed - friendly, fast, and attentive.  i can't wait to go back.  i might have to convince my family to join me there this weekend because i can't stop thinking about that white trash burger.  it's calling my name.",

It's no coincidence that my favorite burger has fried pickles on it, the white trash (turkey) burger: fried pickles, provolone cheese, and secret sauce.

First, I can see why Pinky's had to place a car on their roof, there is just nowhere to park your damn car!  Thankfully, we noticed a sign that pointed to a lot across the street for Pinky's patrons.  Once we got in, it was slammed; however, duly noted is its small size, so slammed is relative. In any case, we got a small bar top table just big enough for 2 people.  The weird thing is that we literally had about 4 different servers.  I think it was technically a \"pick-up\" table (for those of you who serve) but a waitress came over, and then a bartender, and then another bartender, and then a different waitress.  I really have no idea what was going on. The plus is that we never needed to ask for refills!  The menu, in theory, looked amazing.  I love the cool titles and the unique items offered.  Who can't laugh at a \"Weiner Wonderland\" section?  I just found my food to be mediocre.  Everything seemed very fried.  It was almost an artery overload that made me feel a bit nauseous.  I have mixed feelings about returning but will be open to reading future reviews that may change my mind!",

    "text": "As a lifelong resident of the Queen City, all 53 years spent proudly on the West side, I am glad to see that there is some measure of revitalization along, at least, parts of Freedom Drive. I was very happy when Pinky's moved in. Previous rave reviews by others aside, I am not totally wowed by this restaurant. They do some things right, and to be fair, I have not tried everything on the menu. My wife and I started with the crab puppies. They were pretty good. I am an avowed hush puppy lover and these were good. Think the inside breading part of those cheap deviled crabs rolled into a ball and deep fried. The dipping sauce was good too with a slightly spicy, old bay kind of hint to it. The waffle fries were not great. I felt like they had been sitting around for a little while. They were warm, but not piping hot, and a little tough, but not greasy in the least but not crispy either. The regular burger, westside style ( Mustard, chili, slaw, & onions) was OK. the toppings and the bun were great but the patty just so-so. a tad dry without a lot of flavor, nobody comes here to lose weight, so maybe more fat in the mix would up the flavor quotient. . I know that the Great state of NC handicaps restaurants by dictating that they cook burgers well done, so I will not put all the blame on Pinky. My wife had the same criticism for the white trash burger. toppings were slightly better than the patty and the spicy sauce was the only thing that gave it any interest, the rest was just flavorless texture. The one brightly shining star from this visit was the Viking Corn Dog. Even a Harding Ram like myself can't help loving this masterpiece. Piping hot. crisp and golden brown, the dog was high quality and salty and savory, while the coating was slightly sweet, and the perfect thickness to compliment the dog. We loved the atmosphere, service was very good,  and parking was not a problem, but we were there at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon during the Panther's game, I understand they can get pretty crowded at other times. Keep up the good work on the things you do right. If you could give half stars, Pinky's would get 2 1/2 from me",

I ordered the Popcorn chicken which honestly was decent but my chicken was brunt and overcooked..  it came iwth Waffle fries which honestly you could get at  Chik Fil A.  Also they asked what kind of dipping sauces we wanted for our chicken I stated ranch and BBQ we only get one any other sauce its a 75 cents charge!!

    "text": "Yet another on my quest to try the \"Best\" burger places in Charlotte.  I had lunch at Pinky's on a Saturday afternoon.  In a common trend now-a-days, Pinky's is in a repurposed gas station.  The weather was nice and they had the garage doors open.  I got there about 15-20 minutes after they opened so it wasn't too busy yet.  I ordered the mammoth burger, which is  two 5 oz patties.  I opted for everything, which is mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickles.  I also ordered a side of waffle fries and a side of onion rings.  My food came out very quickly, I don't think I even had time to read the front page of my paper yet.  All the food looked delicious.  The burger was juicy, but didn't have as much flavor as I wanted.  Still it was very good, cooked to just being legal.  The waffle fries were hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, cooked perfectly.  The onion ring, well what can I say about those rings.  If I had to pick one word it would be nirvana.  They were some of the best onion rings I have ever had.  They were sliced thin, with the breading barely clinging to them.  The onions were sweet tasting and the breading had a nice flavor.  They did have quite a bit of grease though.  The service was fantastic.  It might have been because it was still slow, but most of the staff that passed by asked how everything was and if I needed anything, not just my server, but all the wait staff and even the hostess.  Not quite the best burger I've had in Charlotte, but it is close to the top.",

    "text": "Friends, let's be completely honest about the ding dong chicken.  It was sub par to say the least!   Before even getting to the ultimate fail of the peanut butter, the chicken \"pattie\" and cafeteria-like white bun really deflated any chance of this being worth it's cost.  Both were clearly mass produced, frozen, thawed, warmed and slopped on a plate after being cooked in an admittedly decent array of spices.  The only reason I ordered this particular sando was to partake on a thai like peanut/spice journey and to take my first bite and arrive with a thick schtick of crunchy Jif on the roof of my mouth couldn't have pissed me off more.  This sandwich seriously had potential, but it's like someone gave up along the way and settled for \"this will do\". That being said, I'm willing to give the joint another shot for two reasons: 1.  The white bean hummus was tasty. 2.  They were giving away free beer in lieu of not having secured their ABC permit. I sincerely hope this place makes it b/c it's great for the neighborhood, but I feel there are some menu offerings that need to step it up a notch.",

    "text": "We went here 2 weeks ago because we heard it was run by the same guys that Penguin kicked out... and we were super disappointed. Lets start with the \"must have\" crab hushpuppies... they were pretty burned and not all the great (even though the tarter sauce served with it was pretty great it couldn't save them) but at this point i didn't say anything.   My husband and I got our burgers and as I went to take my first bite noticed a huge nasty hair on my burger... GROSS!! our never present waitress couldn't be found (again) so the bartender saw me looking for someone and screamed across the bar @ me \"what's up\"? not wanting to scream back the problem she finally came over and saw why i wasn't happy. She said she would get me another burger immediately and left. so as i sit i go to snack on our fries... and they were hard as bricks... not crispy or slightly done my oil soaked old fries. gross again. by this time i was pretty ticked but still being nice. 20 minutes later another server flings a burger on the table at me and walks away... except it wasn't what i ordered!!! my husband said his burger was pretty dry and not that great too. by the time someone comes by again i tell them its not what i wanted, the girl picks up my burger goes to the bartender and they ensue on arguing about how i didn't know what I was talking about and what i did/ did not order in front of the whole bar, why they just didn't check the ticket was beyond me.  i ordered a simple burger!  By the time the girl came back over i told her to forget about it and we just wanted our check. she took off the hush puppies because of everything (which i totally appreciated) and boxed up the \"replacement\" burger and we left asap. Not impressed especially for all the raves!! we drove in from out of town and would have rather gone across the street to the other burger joint. Def won't go back. burgers were half ass and not worth the time.",

I was a bit skeptical at first as it took a few minutes to even be greeted on a busy Sunday night but once in our seats the service was excellent and food was even better. Started out with the pimp'n fries which are waffle fries topped with pimento cheese. They were spectacular.  For the entree I got the pinky dog which was a hot dog topped with their house made chili and pimento cheese. It was incredible. I'm not sure what was in the chili but I wish I had the recipe. 100 percent this place deserves 5 stars. My girlfriend got the white trash burger and loved it as well.  Again if you're looking for a down home spot with great food and good vibes this is your place!",

These three items were never meant to be said in the same sentence, yet somehow, they come together to create a sandwich that leaves you confused but satisfied at the same time. I would also recommend the fried pickles. One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Pinky's is such a wonderfully funky place, inside and out. Follow the Beetle Beacon to this former auto repair shop and you'll rub elbows with bikers and businessmen who unite under the same banner--that of deliciousness and fun! There's plenty to check out on the walls while you wait for your grub, though you never have to wait long...the service team is a well-oiled machine!   I've eaten my way through most of the menu and I have never had a meal that disappointed me. Burgers are great--Mom loves the White Trash burger and I like mine Ding Dong style. Don't be afraid of it-- sounds gross, yet tastes amazing!! Order some Pimp'n fries or Crab Puppies to start and you won't need sides with your entree, though the sweet potato fries and black eyes pea salad are both great as well.  Also, daily specials are on the chalkboard behind the hostess stand--look for salmon tacos, which should be on the menu permanently because they're that yummy. You really can't go wrong, folks!  Good beer selection, and mixed drinks are plentiful and generously poured. Seating is available at the bar, booths, and inside and outside (lovely when they roll up the garage doors and open up the back dining room!). Only possible issue is parking. If you're not lucky enough to get one of the six or so spots in front, circle around on Morehead (heading away from uptown) and park in the gravel lot past the garage. A bit sketchy when muddy, but otherwise worth the trip (and the short walk).   Hands down, my favorite place to eat in this part of the Queen City. Consider it if you would like a delicious and deliciously affordable place to hang that's minutes from  uptown, hit up Pinky's and thank me later when you wake from your food coma!!",

    "text": "Had some friends in town this weekend , which resulted in us all being hungover on Sunday needing something greasy that we could pickup. Pinkys happens to be right down the street from my new house so we decided to give it a shot. Like how bad can something be if Guy Fieri's into it , right?   I pulled up to pinkys which is actually decorated pretty cool both inside and out. Was kinda bummed we got it to go as it seemed like a cool spot to grab a burger and a beer. Decor , fun environment , and seemed to be pretty good happy hour options is where a lot of my allocated stars are going.   The food however left something to be desired. I ordered the garlic lime chicken tacos , and upon taking my first bite noticed I had in fact received buffalo shrimp tacos. Being the lazy host who picked the closest place to my house for pickup , I decided not to say anything. Im just going to eat these shrimp tacos , but I couldn't t. There was entirely too much buffalo sauce , the shrimp were undercooked very chewy , and cold inside. I thought it was in my best interest to throw them out. I  wasn't furious because I also ordered the crab hushpuppies , which were actually pretty solid , and I would recommend. One of my guest got the mammoth burger , which didn't have any of the condiments or  toppings he requested but he did say it was a pretty good burger.  He ordered a side onion rings to share , which were kind of like shoe string onion rings. I feel like they would have been pretty good if they weren't so cold and soggy. One guest ordered the fish tacos , which he said tasted like captain ds. I have never been to Captain Ds so I'm still uncertain if this was a good or bad thing , I didn't ask him to elaborate because I didn't wanna look like a nerd for never getting captain ds. We also got the corn dog shrimp to share , which were by far the best corn dog shrimp I've ever had but also the only.   I apologize for the monster previous paragraph , if anybody's still here I would recommend If you're getting it to go , I would at least checking your food before you leave. Lets face it , to go food is never as good as dine in food (excludes Chinese). I will probably give Pinkys another shot because its a mile from my house and some of the stuff was good , but I will be dining in.",

Not a dive by any means, but a funky diner with a light hearted way of serving up some seriously delicious food.  I had the burger w/pimento cheese which was outstanding!!! I am eager to try some of the other offerings, notably their corn dog and bologna sandwich. Service was exceptional!!! Attentive, friendly and helpful.

    "text": "I guess it's time to update my review. I know everyone and their mothers LOVE Pinky's, but honestly I never feel that excited to be here. One reason... service is always spotty. You may have a good experience once, but chances are don't hold your breath.   I was here for lunch yesterday. I had to use the lady's room right away (that's what I got for drinking water like I should) and when the waiter stopped by I simply wasn't ready to order. I asked for a minute, and 15 minutes later the guy still hasn't stopped back by. Look, it's lunch, and I was in my work attires, meaning I don't have all day. And I kept staring at the waiter hoping to get some eye contact. He never once looked around or looked up. Everytime I thought he was heading our way, he would get stopped by something or someone, and turned around without once paying attention to our table. That's just annoying! I literally became that b!tch, and raised my arm waving like a maniac in hope to get some service.   When he finally stopped by, instead of offering an apology, he told us that he's not the only one who could have helped us.  REALLY? Well, since you didn't inform us that your restaurant has an open table/grab whoever you like policy, I thought you're MY waiter!   The only saving grace was the manager (I'm assuming she's the manager) stopped by and offered an explanation (something got mixed up at another table, which caused every waitstaff to stop whatever they're doing to un-mix the situation) and an apology. And she even offered up a banana pudding to go (which I gave to my coworkers because I don't really eat banana pudding - thus no comment can be made). 1 star for effort to make it right.  Food: I never know what to eat here. Typically I go with the burger (southern style), but they are very greasy. And for $5 you get a single burger (with cheese) and no side... a little steep. Yesterday I branched out and ordered the Green Chile Pork sandwich ($6.75). It was different, and I liked it (too bad I had to wolf in down in record time, which caused some serious discomfort immediately after). The pork wasn't overcooked but could be more seasoned. I like the use of arugula instead of lettuce. And the pineapple is refreshing (can be grilled a little more).  Overall food was a solid 3 star.   To sum it up: People who adore this place are still going to come here. For those who haven't visited, visit once to decide for yourself. I'm not the biggest fan, but it's a-ok.   P.S. Parking is still a pain. Now if you drive pass the place on the right there's an empty lot (instead of across the street which is now occupied by a new Dunkin' Donuts)  P.S. Tuesday is $2.50 draft beer special",

The short of it is that the food was really good, but we still missed kickoff, and both first series.    We were seated promptly, and drink orders were taken.  10 minutes later, our beers showed up.  Pinky's advertises 16 oz Miller Lite got $3.  I ordered this, and received a 12 oz.  When bringing this to the waitresses attention, she said thats not what I ordered, and walked away.  We ordered appetizers, fried pickles and crab hushpuppies.  These were very good, but when we got to the bottom of the pickles, there was a pool of fryer grease in the bottom of the tray, thus making the last few inedible.    For the main course, I ordered the white trash burger and this was awesome.  My wife ordered some type of chicken sandwich with peanut butter and siracha sauces, and a basket of fries for us to split.  The sandwich didn't come with the siracha as stated, and we didn't get our fries until we asked for them several more times.  One of our friends didn't get his food until everyone else was done eating their meal.  Overall everyone loved the food (5 Stars), but the service was absolutely horrible (Negative 5 Stars)!!!  Maybe we'll try it again in a few years, but we're in no hurry to go back here to be treated like crap.  There are places closer to home I can go for that...",

The parking lot was blocked off but motorcycles can squeeze around the barriers.  The food was reasonably priced and was prepared pretty quickly (10-15 minutes at most).    My wife had the popcorn chicken and it was pretty mediocre to be honest.  You really had to douse it in ketchup and ranch to give it the moisture/flavor it needed.  It was dry, light on the breading, and light on the crunch.  It also came with waffle-fries and those were of less seasoned and crunchy than the ones I've had at Carl's Jr.    I had the Falafel Wrap with Hummus for about $7.  It was pretty yummy, and was definitely better than the popcorn chicken, but it wasn't impressively yummy.  I regret not going with the White Trash burger like everybody else.  I'll definitely be back here to try some more of their food because it seems like a popular, and affordable place but for now, I'd only be able to give them 3 stars.",
